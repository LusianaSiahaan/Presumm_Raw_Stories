It is a  much  needed  book  in  a  market  that  is  shifting  rapidly.  The  advent  of broadband has increased the viability of using 3D to seduce, entertain and inform on the Web. This is a unique book that deals with making 3D arti- facts,  specifically  designed  for  Web  delivery.  You  will  be  shown  how  to make stunning interactive 3D animations that will elevate your website to cutting-edge status.  The book is aimed at Web designers new to 3D, students, 3D modelers and animators and all Digital Artists. Whatever your current skill level, from begin- ner to advanced user, there will be something for you in this book. If you are a novice to the world of 3D then this book will teach you the basics and guide you through to an advanced level. If you are already knowledgeable in 3D then there are plenty of tips and tricks to further hone your skills and create complex and believable animations, games and environments.  To those of you who have picked up this book and are new to 3D, you prob- ably have one big question: ‘What’s so special about 3D?’  My reply would be that 3D has immediate appeal far beyond that of a 2D graphic representation.  To see how attractive 3D is, try this simple test. If you were visiting a web- site and wanted to search for a book. Which icon would you rather click on? My guess is the one on the right.   Introduction.qxd  8 12 04  15:24  Page 2  2  3D for the Web  Even though the actual information on the 3D object is smaller and less legible, it is somehow friendlier and more accessible. You are also able to see much more visual information about the shape of the object, by seeing more than one dimension.  3D has an immediate appeal. It can reflect the world we know and live in. Clicking on the 3D icon feels more like browsing through a bookshop.  Now let us think about 3D that moves. How about a button, which one do you want to push?  I think you will agree that the 3D button is more likely to get hit. It is also likely  to  respond  in  a  typical  way.  We  would  expect  the  middle  part  to depress and the collar to stay where it is. It also looks like it might produce a satisfying clunk when hit. The other button might do that too, but we have no expectation. How great is it to see the button move, have an idea of its texture and hear its re-assuring sound? 3D delivers the world as we know it, enabling us to understand what we see faster and more easily.  So if you wanted to sell something on a website 3D is clearly a better way of showing the goods, but it is also the best way of entertaining and seducing a visitor to your site. This is why games have graduated to 3D. Why play Asteroids in 2D when you can add a whole new dimension? 2D is the silent black and white movie to 3D’s Technicolor Surround sound.  Okay, I hope I have convinced you, now let’s get to the inevitable next ques- tion; how do I learn it? This book is going to give you all the knowledge you need. You will acquire the techniques and skills to produce high quality 3D for the Web. But it is more than a manual; each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is tutorial based, and is meant to be used alongside your computer. You will get step-by-step instructions on how to create everything from  simple  3D  buttons,  to  fully  fledged  interactive  character  animations.  The second part consists of interviews with award winning, internationally acclaimed companies and individuals who use 3D as a major component in their websites. You will get hands-on technical instruction and an under- standing of how it fits into real projects. There is also a CD full of examples and tutorial files.   Introduction.qxd  8 12 04  15:24  Page 3  Introduction  3  ‘High quality’ – what is it and how do you achieve it? Defining high quality is a subjective topic – how do you quantify good design and good taste. Surely quality is in the eye of the beholder. A high quality website for me is a link I want to send to friends saying, ‘Have a look at  this‘, not for the information the site holds, but for the idea behind it and the visual ‘wow’ factor. Now admittedly, I work in Animation and Design, and so do a lot of my friends, but you would be amazed by the buzz a good website makes – news travels the way it does for a sleeper hit movie or a new electronic game. You have experienced something good and you want to share that enjoyment with others. Before you know it, chat rooms are buzzing with people discussing your site. Away from the Internet, this sort of buzz is called ‘word-of-mouth’, on the Internet it has the rather unfortunate name of ‘Viral Marketing’, but do not be put off by the name, achieving the sort of publicity where your site is recommended by individuals can lead to an exponential growth in the number of visitors you get. Creating a high quality and entertaining website that stands out from the others is going  to  get  you  noticed.  Whether  you  use  3D  for  the  interface  design  or  in  the creation of computer games, this book will show how to get that com- petitive edge.  The people we have chosen to interview are successful and have that com- petitive edge, their websites are a joy to behold. There is a lot to learn from the  interviews.  Factors  such  as  character  design,  lighting,  sound,  timing, economy and good ideas have played a lot in their success. We cannot give you good ideas on a plate, but we can show you the path to recognizing the good ideas you have and realizing these ideas in 3D on the Web.  Using the software To anyone new to 3D, there may well seem a bewildering array of soft- ware. You will need to use different pieces of software to achieve great 3D results, from modeling and animation to interactivity, game creation and Web publishing. Although some pieces of software do cover most of these areas, in this book we are using the most popular packages in the Web and Game industry. The modeling and animation tutorials in this book were writ- ten in Discreet’s 3D Studio Max 5.1 with Character Studio, but should work equally well on earlier and later versions. Macromedia’s Flash  MX 2004  and Director  MX  are the most widely used packages for delivering inter- active content on the Web and the tutorials take you through the essential skills needed for 3D interactivity. 96% of Internet computers have the Flash player on and 85% have the Director Shockwave player, making them indus- try standards. Macromedia Dreamweaver  MX 2004  is the most popular   Introduction.qxd  8 12 04  15:24  Page 4  4  3D for the Web  web page authoring package and using this in combination with the other programs will give you the depth of knowledge you need. All of these pro- grams  are  available  as  demos  from  their  respective  websites   www.dis- creet.com  and  www.macromedia.com .  The  chances  are  that  you  will already have access to one or more of these packages and by using this multi-stage approach, you will gain the flexibility you need to be a success- ful 3D Web designer.  This book is written in user-friendly and accessible language. It is intended to inspire you, and help you unleash your ambitions in the wonderful world of 3D.

Indeed, young kids often skip from one exhibit to another pressing buttons as they go and not even wait- ing to see the effect the button has. Adults do it too. Have you ever pressed the button at a pedestrian traffic light even though the wait light is showing, as if it will make the little red man turn green faster? Or pumped an eleva- tor button to make the lift hurry up?  So how does this translate to a website? Websites consist of buttons, graph- ics and text. The idea of a button or hyperlink is crucial to all website navi- gation.  This  button  could  be  a  text  or  a  graphic.  It  is  important  that  all visitors to your site can first identify what a button is, and that having found it, they are motivated to click on that button to get through to further informa- tion on your site.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 6  6  3D for the Web  As we have already indicated, a 3D button oozes appeal. There is no trouble recognizing it, as it looks like a button from the real world, and on a website we have an added advantage in helping the visitor hit that button. Website but- tons inherently have three states. First, the dormant state of the button waiting to be noticed. Secondly, the ‘rollover’ state as the mouse hovers over it, will the visitor succumb to the urge? Thirdly, the mouse ‘click’ on the button. Hurrah, your audience is snared; they are traveling deeper into your website.  So let us start by building a simple button in 3D. This is an easy exercise to get you going, but it provides the stepping stone to so much more.  Open your 3D package and you will see a shocking amount of interface – even the simplest 3D software program is ‘deep’. It has to be; this is in essence the same sort of software that brought you Toy Story and the effects in The Matrix. Do not panic, you have to start somewhere, once we have guided you through the tutorials in this book; you will have accumulated a lot of knowledge.  Whatever 3D software you have, you are likely to have the default four win- dows. Three of these windows give the orthographic  non-perspective  view of anything you build in them. Typically your interface will have a front ele- vation, side elevation and top view. The fourth window will allow you to move your view of on object in an isometric or Perspective view.  If you are a beginner, when you create an object and manipulate it, it is best to use the orthographic views, as the Perspective view is more for look- ing around your object and checking you like it from all angles.  Working in a 3D environment, every point in space can be mapped using coordinates on three axes: x, y and z. A virtual object is created by joining points or vertices in this space.  It takes a while to get used to moving around between these windows, so if you are completely new to the software, try this simple exercise to get warmed up.  Introduction to modeling in 3D: building blocks Create two separate standard primitive boxes in the top viewport, any size, and stack one on top of the other.  What to do  Click Create  cid:2  Standard Primitives  cid:2  Box. Click and drag in the top view- port to create a rectangle, then drag again  three dimensions, remember .   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 7  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  7  You will not see anything happen in the top viewport, but if you look at the others, you will see a new height dimension being added. Make another box. Put one box on top of the other by using the Select and Move icon in the Tool Bar. Try this first of all in the perspective viewport, and you will dis- cover how hard it can be to manipulate in freeform 3D space, but if you use the three orthographic views, it is a simple matter to arrange a stack of boxes by sticking to two axes at a time  Figure 1.1 . Try and develop an ease with looking and moving from one window to another, and check the result in your perspective viewport.  Incidentally, it is always good practice to start creating any object in the top viewport.   Figure 1.1 Stacking Boxes. The four views in 3D Studio Max  How to make a simple 3D button Use simple primitive objects to make a realistic button.  What to do  This button is made from two standard primitives. First the button itself is made from a cylinder. Create a cylinder that looks suitably proportioned in the top viewport. Notice that as you make your cylinder there are different   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 8  8  3D for the Web  parameter counters on the screen. All cylinders are defined by their radius and height. If you are a precise person, you can type values in here to make sure the button is the correct proportion for you. The other options you are given are whether the cylinder is capped top and bottom, how many height segments it has, and how many sides make up the perimeter. You can see in this perspective view that this cylinder has 5 height segments and 18 sides. It also has two cap segments  Figure 1.2 .  Figure  1.2 Standard  Primitive  cid:2  Cylinder   shown  as  Smooth  cid:3  Highlights  with Edged Faces on   Note  Whenever  you  set  out  to  build  anything  in  3D,  it  is  a  good  idea  to think about these extra parameters, as they are the key to the all imp- ortant face count when transferring to Shockwave. More of this later. Because your button will end up as a still at this at this stage, we can be as generous as we like with our face count.  Top Tip It is usual to keep the three orthographic views as showing objects in Wireframe,  and  the  perspective  viewport  showing  Smooth  cid:3  Highlights. It is often helpful to tick Edged Faces, so you can see the model and the structure together. You can change from one mode to another by R-clicking in the top-left of a viewport over the named view, and selecting what you wish from the drop down menu.  Alternatively F3 will toggle between Wireframe and Smooth  cid:3  Highlights, and F4 toggles Edged Faces on and off.    Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 9  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  9  Now comes the fun bit. We want the cylinder to look more realistic and put a dimple in the middle. To do this we have to tweak it at Sub-Object level, and this means converting it to an Editable Mesh. In 3D Studio Max this is done by selecting the object and R-clicking in a viewport, a drop down menu appears and you choose Convert to  cid:2  Editable Mesh. When you do this the modifier stack for your cylinder will have a new label: Editable Mesh.  Note  The modifier stack allows you to travel up and down an object’s his- tory. Because the program reads the stack from the bottom to the top, you can change parameters from the beginning of an object’s history. In 3D Studio Max, converting the object to an Editable Mesh collapses the stack; i.e. You can no longer change the cylinder’s mesh parame- ters. In more complex modeling, it is a good idea to save versions of your work before you commit to this action.  Editable Meshes have a drop down menu for Sub-Object manipulation. Open it out and have a look. This is the heart of all modeling in 3D  Figure 1.3 .  Figure 1.3 Sub-Object mode. Text and icons    A vertex is a single point on your model.   An edge is the line between two vertices.   A face is a planar triangular surface.   A polygon is made from two faces, and is the plane between four vertices.   The element is the whole object. Click on each and select some to see what you get. If you select vertex, then all the points show up in blue, selected points are red.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 10  10  3D for the Web  In Sub-Object mode we can manipulate each individual vertex, or groups of them. Pick the middle vertex at the top of your cylinder and move it up and down. If you have selected from the top viewport, you may find you have  picked  up  the  middle  vertex  at  the  bottom  too.  Turn  on  Ignore Backfacing, and select it again. Pulling the vertex down creates a dip, but rather a harsh one. Undo  Control  cid:3  Z  and return the vertices to their orig- inal position. We are going to ease the harshness of the dimple in the but- ton by using Soft Selection. With the center vertex still selected, open out Soft Selection and tick it on. Crank the Falloff slider up until the inner ring of vertices turn yellow. Now tweak the center vertex down to create a smooth dip in the top of your button  Figure 1.4 .  Figure 1.4 Creating a dip in the button  Top Tip You can toggle on and off locking your selection by hitting the space bar. This can be very useful if you are moving from one viewport to another a lot.  Our button still looks a bit jagged, and so all that remains is to smooth it. We do this by sub-dividing the polygons. In 3D Studio Max this is done  by adding a Meshsmooth modifier.  Other programs such as Maya call it Sub-Division.    Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 11  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  11  Leave Sub-Object mode, and with your cylinder selected, look down the Modifier List to find the Meshsmooth modifier. Add it to the cylinder’s stack. You will see a box marked ‘Iterations’ make the value of this 1. The poly- gons on your button will increase by approximately fourfold. Your button will now look smooth and attractive.  Note  It is worth noting at this point that at the moment polygon count is not an issue for us – if it were we could achieve a smoother model with fewer polygons by slightly more complex methods. For now let us revel in the liberation of being able to use as many polygons as we want.  Now to make the collar around the button. This is made from another stan- dard primitive; the torus. Click on Create and select a Torus. Make this in the top viewport, if you start by centering it on the center of your cylinder, then you will end up with it in the correct position. You will notice that there are two separate radius parameters for your torus or donut, so you can decide on the width of the collar, you can also change the number of seg- ments to make it smoother. As we are being generous, let us make it 48 seg- ments to give an even, smooth look, as the finished object will be metallic. Now convert your torus to an Editable Mesh, just as you did the cylinder.  Choose polygons in Sub-Object mode, tick off Ignore Backfacing and select all the polygons in the lower half of your torus  Figure 1.5 .  Figure 1.5 Deleting the lower half of the torus   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 12  12  3D for the Web  Now press Delete. To make our button collar more realistic, it would be nice to flatten it a bit. To do this leave Sub-Object mode and select Melt from the Modifier List. Add it to the torus stack. Experiment with this modifier. There are different settings which make the Mesh of an object relax and mimic melting. I found an amount of 4 on the default Ice Melt to be about right.  Note  One of the confusing things to a beginner is how 3D programs give different modifiers widely varied parameters’ scales; some slider set- tings are increments of 0.01 and others go up to tens of thousands. It is often worth moving the slider about a bit first so you can get a feel for the effect it is having.  Note  Make sure your collar and button fit together snugly. You can do this by examining it in the perspective viewport. When you are happy, hit Quick Render  the green teapot on the top tool bar. If you cannot see it, drag the tool  bar  to  the  left  with  the  hand  icon   and  take  a  look  at  your  button. Looking good, now let us give it some materials.  Select your button and open the Material Editor  Figure 1.6 . You will see a number of sample gray slots containing spheres. Select one and click on the box next to Diffuse. A color chart pops up and you can select a red color for  your  button.  We  want  the  button  to  be  a  bit  shiny,  so  increase  the Specularity  and  Glossiness  until  the  sample  slot  material  looks  suitable. Apply it to your button by either dragging and dropping or using the Assign Material  to  Selection  button.  Your  button  will  go  red  as  it  takes  on  the assigned material.  This is the most basic way materials can be used, simply assigning a color  and  light  absorbency  to  an  object.  When  we  need  to  export materials using Shockwave, we can only use relatively simple materi- als like this, or enhance them by using materials created by us as bit- maps. Often this is enough to create great graphics, but the material options for ordinary export are manifold. No material can be treated in isolation, it is dependant on a huge number of influences like light- ing, atmosphere and proximity of reflected objects. There are any num- ber of ways of achieving the desired look and lighting and materials are an art in their own right.  Now to give the collar a metallic look: select the collar and choose another material sample slot. The default gray can remain the same, but increase the Specular level to about 75 to make the ring shiny, and use your judg- ment on how glossy it should be  I opted for 20 . Now scroll down to the Maps Rollout and open it. You will see a whole lot of extra parameters available.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 13  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  13  Figure 1.6 The Material Editor  Accessed by hotkey ‘M’ on the keyboard   If you click in the box labeled ‘None’ next to Reflect, a Map Browser will pop up that offers you a lot of options for different maps to use with your material.  The  identifying  symbol  for  a  map  is  a  green  square.  Choose Raytrace from the Browser by double-clicking it  Figure 1.7 .  Set the amount to 25. The sample slot will not change, because Raytrace instructs the software to calculate reflections from the scene, any Raytracing will only be revealed when we render. Assign the metallic material to the collar in the scene and we will add some lights to make the object more realistic.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 14  14  3D for the Web  Figure 1.7 Material Map Browser  Note  The default lighting in a 3D program is ambient. Ambient light means a flat uniform light emanating from each object, regardless of the light source. It is fine for general purposes, but fatal to bringing any quality of light in a scene. There are three basic lights in most 3D programs: spotlights,  directional  lights  and  omnis.  Direct  lights  mimic  distant spotlights like the sun, producing parallel shadows. Omnis are more likely to be fill lights, but can also be used as highlighters along with target spotlights. The look of a 3D scene is not as intuitive as live action is for a Lighting Photographer. We cannot see the light, as it is virtual, but have to check it by rendering previews. Lighting is 5% setting up and 95% revisions and adjustments.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 15  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  15  Click on Create  cid:2  Lights  Figure 1.8 .  Figure 1.8 Creating lights in 3D Studio Max  Choose an Omni light; this is a light that shines all around equally, rather than directionally as a Target Spot. The default brightness is 1  Called Multiplier in 3D Studio Max  and this will be our highlighter. Place the light above and to the right of your button, at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. Create another Omni and position it to the left of your button, and slightly lower, this will be our ‘fill’ light. Change the Multiplier to about 0.5 so it is half as bright. Now render from your perspective viewport. The collar should be reflecting the red of the button and you should have some pleasing high- lights on the finished surfaces  Figure 1.9 .  Figure 1.9 The rendered button  Now all that remains is to get your button ready for the Web.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 16  16  3D for the Web  Preparing a button for the Web The language of the Web is HTML, and it has its limitations with regards to links.  The  effect  of  a  button  is  to  change  the  mouse  pointer  when  you rollover it, thus indicating to the user that it is a button. However, with the addition of the Javascript language you can create a rollover state. This means that the graphic used to display the button can be swapped when the mouse is on top of it, giving you the opportunity to create a more inter- esting  result.  It  is  possible  to  create  more  complicated  buttons  than  this, using Macromedia Flash and we will talk about this later. First we should animate our button in our 3D program in order to create our rollover states.  Exercise: animating the button in 3D An introduction to the simplest animation you can do.  What to do  To animate the button being pressed is very simple. Along the bottom of your program is a frame counter. Below it there is a button called Auto Key. Switch Auto Key on  in earlier versions of 3ds max this was less confusingly called the ‘animate’ button  and the surrounding viewport box will turn red, this reminds you that you are now in Animation mode. The first thing we need to do is set a Keyframe for the button in its normal position. To do this, select your button and from the top right panel select Motion. Under PRS Parameters, Click on the Create Key  cid:2  Position. A key will appear on the timeline at 0  Figure 1.10 .  This Keyframe sets our button at that time, in that position. To animate, move the slider on the timeline on to frame 8, and in a side viewport move your button down to look as if it has been pressed. A Keyframe will automatically appear. You can play your animation now and the button will go down. That is all the animation you need to do for actually moving the button. The button will be taking rather a long time to get pressed, eight frames is the equivalent of a third of a second and a bit too slow for our purposes, so now by moving the Keyframes, we will get the button’s timing right and bring it back up again. Start by sliding the Keyframe from frame 0 to frame 5, that gives us three frames of animation, which looks and feels better. To return the button to its normal state, duplicate the first key, by Shift-clicking and dragging on it. A new key will appear that carries the same properties as the first key. Put this key at frame 14. If you play your animation now, you will see the button bob down and straight back up again. To make it more realistic, copy your second Keyframe  from frame 8  and drag it to frame 11.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 17  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  17  Figure 1.10 PRS Parameters. Creating keys  Now the button will stay down for three frames. Play your animation again  Figure 1.11 .  Figure 1.11 Button down   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 18  18  3D for the Web  Now our button moves we have created the rollover states that we require. We need to render two frames of our animation, one frame in the up state and one frame in the down state. To do this select the Rendering  cid:2  Render Menu  Figure 1.12 .  Figure 1.12 The Render Menu. 3D Studio Max  There are a few important points to be aware of here, one is the image size. The  size  of  the  image  is  going  to  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  download speed of your site. Although broadband is becoming more and more pop- ular you should still always try to keep your graphics down to the minimum size they need to be. Although you can resize a button in HTML, you do not want to have to, as there is no point in downloading a full screen image that is only going to appear in a tiny section of your website. We need to decide what size our buttons need to be, and this would be done in the planning stage of your web page design. In this particular case we will decide that we want our buttons to be nice and big, so I suggest a size of 100 pixels wide and 60 pixels high, as this roughly matches the shape of the button. On  a  screen  this  will  be  approximately  an  inch  across,  although  it  very much depends on the monitor size and the screen resolution. So set the Render Scene palette to the settings in Figure 1.12 or change them to suit your own needs. You may need to reposition the button on the screen using the Pan tool  the hand  and the Zoom tool  the magnifying glass , in order to make the button fit properly on the rendered image. Test it by pressing the   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 19  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  19  Render button and when you are happy, save the image by clicking on the Disk icon of the resulting image. Select JPEG as the image format and use a quality level of 80. Render and save frame 1 and frame 10.  The other point to remember is the background color. As part of your web- site design, you should have already decided upon a background color. You  can  choose  your  background  color  to  match  whatever  background color  you  are  going  to  use  in  your  web  page  by  going  to  the  menu Rendering  cid:2  Environment  cid:2  Background  Color.  The  next  section  will explain why this is a good idea.  Bitmap graphic formats There are three graphic formats used on the Web, each with different prop- erties and pros and cons. They are the graphics interchange format  GIF , pronounced like ‘gift’, but without the ‘t’; the joint photographic experts group  JPEG ,  pronounced  ‘jay-peg’  and  the  portable  network  graphic   PNG ,  pronounced ‘ping’.  GIF files have been around since the beginning of the Web and have a simple form of compression that means that if the images have large areas of plain color, then they will compress to quite a small size. The main issue with GIFs is that they can only be made out of 256 colors at the most, not full color  16 million . They can be less  in powers of two, like 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. , which helps the overall file size. Generally it is not usual to use GIFs for photographic images, as they can look poor quality and have a very large file size. They are more commonly used for graphic styles like cartoon.  There are a few versions of GIF files that allow other features. You can select a color to be invisible, usually the background, which can be handy for placing  your  buttons  and  images  over  backgrounds  of  different  colors. Another version is the animated GIF, which as the name describes allows you to have multiple frames in a graphic. However, you should be wary of using this for large animations as there is no inter-frame compression, so a GIF with 100 frames in is the same as loading 100 images just for one object, which could take a long time on a normal modem if the graphic is large.  GIF  JPEG  The JPEG is the choice format for photographic or highly detailed and col- orful imagery. It uses a variable compression technique, meaning that the   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 20  20  3D for the Web  image quality is affected when severely compressed. However, you have the choice of varying the amount of compression you want, often specified by image quality  low, medium or high  or by a numerical scale  0–100 or 0–10 . In brief, the higher the value, the larger the image, the lower the smaller. I tend to find a compromise between size and quality at medium compression  5 or 50 .  JPEGs do not have the option for background transparency so your back- ground needs to match the web page background.  JPEGs  can  be  progressive,  which  means  that  they  load  in  three  or  so phases, the first being very low resolution, the last being the final resolution. This means that users can get an idea of what the image looks like before its completely loading up, as opposed to appearing normally from the top downward.  PNG  PNGs are an improvement on the GIF standard; they use a similar method for compression. However, they are not restricted by the color depth and can be full color. Another great advantage is that they can contain an alpha channel. This is like an extra color layer to the red, green and blue that make up the images. The alpha channel is 256 shades of transparency, which means that your graphics can have clear backgrounds, smooth edges  anti-aliasing  or semi-transparent areas. Although GIF can have a clear background, the edges  can  look  pixilated  or  blocky,  but  having  anti-aliased  edges  is  the  perfect solution  Figure 1.13 .  GIF  JPEG  PNG  Figure  1.13 Enlarged  view  of  a  button  saved  as  GIF  format   with  clear  back- ground  on the left, as low quality JPEG  with a white background  in the center, and as a PNG  with alpha-transparency  on the right  With our particular images, the quality of the inner part of the image is not particularly affected between the GIF and the PNG, but the edge is signifi- cantly different. As a higher quality JPEG, the compression would be barely noticeable, but of course you have to be certain of your background.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 21  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  21  The major problem with the PNG format is not one of quality but one of browser  support.  The  most  popular  Web  browser,  Microsoft  Internet Explorer does not fully support PNGs. This means that they will display on your page, but the alpha transparency is not supported, i.e. the best thing about PNGs. Hopefully one day this will be rectified. There are methods for getting round this, involving javascript, but they are relatively complicated compared to the issue being solved by Microsoft.  Get your button on the Web Okay, you have been very patient whilst reading through all the different graphics issues, now to make our two images into a button.  For the purpose of this exercise we will be using Macromedia Dreamweaver MX. The Dreamweaver program is very popular amongst Web designers and is relatively easy to understand. If you have not used it before then I suggest you practice by running through some of the tutorials supplied with the program. At this stage we will not be delving deeply into it. There are plenty of other web page authoring programs that you could use, and you can even assemble web pages online. To do this you would need to get some web space.  Getting some web space  There  are  various  companies  on  the  Web  that  offer  free  web  space,  in return for displaying advertisements on your page. You can search for these on the Web and you will often find that they will have an option to build your own website using pre-defined templates. It is also possible to upload your graphics into them and create links. From a skills and flexibility point of view though, it is going to be better for you to learn to use a proper authoring  program,  like  Dreamweaver,  in  combination  with  your  web space.  Note  Uploading means sending files to a remote computer, as opposed to downloading, which means receiving files from a remote computer.  If you have got some free web space, then you will be given an address that will be yours to upload web pages and graphics to. If you use a web page authoring program then you will upload your files via file transfer protocol  FTP . The Web Host company should tell you what your FTP address will be in their instructions. You will put this information into Dreamweaver, along with your password, when you set up a site.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 22  22  3D for the Web  Note  You  might  have  web  space  provided  with  your  Internet  service  provider  ISP . As with free web space, you should be able to find out from them what your FTP address will be. It is likely that your password will be the same as the one used every time you log on to the Internet. Often an FTP address  is  on  the  lines  of  ftp.ispcompanyname.com,  and  you  would  be required to use your Internet log on name and password to access your web space. Your resulting web page address might be www.ispcompanyname. com yourname .  Web space refers to having an amount of data area on a hard drive of an ISP’s computer, known as a server. Often this is a reserved space for  you  and  might  be  5,  10,  50  megabytes  of  data  or  more.  How much space you need depends on how big your web pages are; with graphics generally taking up the most space. A small site with a dozen or  so  pages  should  easily  fit  into  5  megabytes  of  web  space.  You always want to try and make your websites as small in data size as possible,  as  people  have  to  download  your  pages  and  you  do  not want them to have to wait ages for this to happen.  Domain name  If you want to have a more personalized address for your website then you could  register  your  own  domain  name,  e.g.  www.yourname.com  or www.yourname.net. There are lots of companies that sell web space  with- out advertising  and you can usually register a domain name at the same time. Another option you have is just to register a domain name through a company  that  will  link  it  to  your  current  web  space.  This  can  save  you money if you already have free space and is a process known as ‘Web forwarding.’  There are many extensions you can have to finish your domain name with, e.g. .com, .org, .net, .tv, .info, .co.uk. The first few are general, but Web addresses often end with letters representing different countries. It is up to you what type of address you get, as long as no one else is using it, but they are often priced at different rates. You can own a domain name for a mini- mum of one year  two years for .info , but you always have the first rights to renew you ownership of the name.  Setting up a website  We are going to create a rollover button in a web page, but before you start this, you need to make sure you have set up your website via Site cid:2 New Site menu of Dreamweaver. It is here that you will enter all your details. If you   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 23  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  23  select  the  Basic  tab,  you  will  be  asked  to  specify  a  site  title  and  your  local file directory and then how you want to connect. Select FTP and then enter your FTP address. You may not need to use a remote folder as your name  and  password  might  direct  you  straight  to  your  folder.  It  should  create a page called ‘index.htm’, this is always the initial page of a direc- tory in a website, the home page. If you were to type in a domain name in a browser, e.g. www.3dfortheWeb.info, then the page it actually opens up is www.3dfortheWeb.info index.htm. Once you have set up your site then you have created a web page, so it is time to create your rollover button from your rendered graphics.  Creating the rollover  First of all, set the background color of your page to white, or whatever color you have decided on, by selecting the Modify  cid:2  Page Properties menu and changing the background color.  Now select the Insert  cid:2  Interactive Images  cid:2  Rollover Image menu and find your two button images. If you have not done so already then you’ll be prompted to save them inside a folder within your website. It is usual practice to have an Images folder where you keep all your images  Figure 1.14 .  Figure 1.14 The Insert Rollover window in Dreamweaver  You will see from Figure 1.14 that you can name the button and type in the page  that  the  button  will  link  to.  The  Alternate  Text  is  used  by  text  only browsers but is particularly important for people with visual disabilities as this text can be read by text-to-speech software.  Press ‘OK’ when you have filled it all in and preview your page in your Web browser  F12 in Dreamweaver . You will see you have a fully working   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 24  24  3D for the Web  button with a rollover effect. You can insert more buttons or even copy and paste this one, changing the links to make them point to different pages.  Well done, you have created your first rollover button. To make it more inter- esting,  you  could  add  sound  or  add  more  animation,  but  rollovers  with JPEGs only allow for two states and no sound. To get sound and animation into your button you need to use Macromedia Flash MX. Here you can eas- ily  create  animated  buttons  from  rendered  image  sequences  and  add sounds. You can also have many more rollover states like Rollout, Press and Release.  Creating a Flash button  Macromedia Flash is by far the most popular plug-in for Internet browsers. Approximately 97% of all Internet users have the Flash plug-in. This is good news, because Flash is a much more powerful way to create your sites than using HTML. You will note that we did not actually have to do any coding to  create  a  button  in  Dreamweaver,  it  created  the  code  for  us.  As  with Dreamweaver I am going to assume that you have made yourself familiar with the Flash interface and gone through at least some of the tutorials. We are  going  to  jump  straight  into  creating  an  animated  button  from  the  animation that we have already created.  First of all go back into your 3D program and render four frames, from the point where the button is up to when it is down. This should be frames 5 to 8, but might vary if you did not follow the tutorial strictly. You need to set the file type to be PNG 24-bit this time, at a resolution of 100 wide and 60 high. From now we will always output as PNG when we are going to put our files into Flash. Flash utilizes the alpha transparency layer which will become very useful in later chapters.  You will notice that when you output these four images they will have been automatically numbered with an extension 0005, 0006, 0007, 0008, etc. This is very useful as Flash will recognize these as a sequence and if we are importing hundreds of frames we will save a lot of time.  Now  load  up  Flash  and  open  the  Modify  cid:2  Document  Properties  menu  Figure 1.15 . Change the size to match our graphic: 100 pixels wide and 60 pixels high. Because our button has a transparent background you can set the background color to anything you like. I have selected white as this matches the rest of the 3D for the Web website. If you set the frame rate to 30 frames per second  fps , from the standard 12 fps then your button will move nice and smoothly. We will talk about frame rates in Chapter 2, as they have an effect on file size and downloading time.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 25  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  25  Figure 1.15 The Flash Document Properties window  Now you have set up your document we need to create a button, this is done by creating what Flash calls ‘symbols’. Symbols are a way to use the same graphic many times without have to reload a copy of it. Select the Insert  cid:2  New Symbol menu  Figure 1.16 . Type in a name, like ‘3D Button’ and select the Button option, then press OK.  Figure 1.16 The Create New Symbol window  You will see that you have been put inside the button symbol. The timeline has changed from showing normal frames to showing four button states, Up, Over, Down and Hit  Figure 1.17 .  What we want to achieve is the animation that we had in our 3D program, i.e. when we place the mouse over the button it smoothly presses down and when we move the mouse out it smoothly goes back up. I will add at this point that you do not have to do this; you might want the button to go down when you press down on it, the ‘Down’ option. This is entirely up to you, but for the purposes of this demonstration, R-click in the timeline on the ‘Over’   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 26  26  3D for the Web  Figure 1.17 Inside a button symbol  frame and select Insert Keyframe, or choose the Insert  cid:2  Keyframe menu after clicking into that frame  Figure 1.18 .  Figure 1.18 Inserting a Keyframe   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 27  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  27  Now we have created a new Keyframe we need to add another symbol into that  frame.  Make  sure  the  frame  is  highlighted  and  select  Insert  cid:2  New Symbol menu. This time we want to create a Movie Clip instead of a button so select that option. A Movie Clip is a series of frames, such as an anima- tion; these can be labeled and called in Flash’s Action Script language. Give it a name like ‘Button Down’ and press ‘OK’. You will see that you have been put back into a normal timeline. What you have to remember is that we are inside our Button Down symbol, which is going to be inside our 3D Button symbol, which will be in the main timeline. It is a hierarchical thing, you see.  Go  to  the  File  cid:2  Import  menu  and  double-click  your  first  picture, ‘Button0005.png’ or whatever you called it, once you have found the folder that the file is in. Flash will realize that it is part of an image sequence, so select ‘Yes’ when prompted by the image sequence question. This will load in the four files into your timeline. If you press Return or Enter on the key- board you will see the button animate.  Now when this is exported as a Flash .swf file, this animation will play and continuously loop. So we are going to make this stop happening, by doing a small bit of coding! There is nothing to type though, just pressing things.  R-click on the last frame in the timeline and select Actions. This should bring up the Actions – Frame window on the screen. Click once on Movie Control and then double-click on stop. This will make the play head stop in the ani- mation when it reaches this point. That is all the coding you need to do for this bit!  Figure 1.19 .  Figure 1.19 Frame Actions window   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 28  28  3D for the Web  We have created the Over state of our button, but now we need to show what happens when the mouse is not over the button. We need to create another Movie Clip symbol, via the Insert  cid:2  New Symbol menu, calling it ‘Button Up’. This time instead of importing the bitmap files, we are going to use  the  ones  we  have  already  imported.  To  find  them  go  to  Window  cid:2  Library menu option. This brings up a list of all the symbols and graphics we have so far, including our four bitmap images  Figure 1.20 .  Figure 1.20 Library palette  We are going to drag three of these images into our page, but before we do this we need to create three Keyframes on the timeline. Click in frame 2 and select Insert  cid:2  Keyframe, and repeat it for frame 3. This Movie Clip is going to be the reverse of the button going down, but we do not need all the ‘down’ pictures. If the reason is not clear, then carry on and hopefully you will see what is going on. Click into frame 1 on the timeline and then drag  your  second-to-last  bitmap  file   3Dbutton0007.png   onto  the  page. Zoom in using the Zoom tool  magnifying glass  so that your image is nice and big. Select the Snap to Pixels option from the view menu, this will help you align the image. Now position the picture so that the box’s top-left cor- ner fits just inside the little cross in the middle of the page. Then select frame 2 and drag and position picture 0006 and finally put picture 0005 in frame three. If you have done this right then when you play the animation the but- ton will not move about, otherwise you will need to adjust the positions, using the cursor keys to nudge them  Figure 1.21 .   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 29  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  29  Figure 1.21 Positioning the 3D button  When you are happy you have got the positions correct, click on the last frame and insert a stop command in action script, as you did before. When you have done that double-click on the ‘3D Button’ button in the Library palette. This will take you back to the button timeline. Now select the first frame and drag your ‘Button Up’ symbol onto page and position it in the same way as before, with top-left of the box aligning with the cross. Select the Over frame and drag and align the ‘Button Down’ symbol. That’s our button symbol created.  Giving the button a sound  We will now introduce a simple sound to our button, to enhance the tactile nature of it. Select the menu Window – Common Libraries  cid:2  Sound; this brings up a choice of default sounds. You can insert your own sounds, by importing them first. To use a library sound, click on the ‘Over’ frame and then find the plastic button sound and drag it onto the graphic on the page. This applies the sound which will play when you rollover the button.  The only task remaining now in Flash is to use the button. Press on Scene 1 to get you back to the main page and drag your 3D Button symbol onto it,   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 30  30  3D for the Web  aligning so that it fits neatly. You can now test the button by selecting the Control  cid:2  Test Movie menu. You should see that it moves down when you rollover and moves back up when you rollout. Close down the test window and select File  cid:2  Export Movie to save your Flash Player button. You can leave all the export settings that appear as they are and press OK.  Now to see the button in action. Go back to Dreamweaver and load up your index page. Delete some or all of your old buttons if you wish and select the Insert  cid:2  Media  cid:2  Flash menu. If you select the Flash graphic that appears, the Properties window should be visible. If not then you can show it from the Window menu. In the Properties window there is a space labeled ‘src’. You can type in the address of your link in this space, so your button will  link  successfully.  Finally  preview  your  finished  Flash  button  in  your browser  F12  or upload it to your Internet host.  Exercise: making the turtle button Let us build on what we have learned to make a turtle button. This little chap will pop out of his shell when the mouse hovers over him, and when the mouse is clicked, turn into road kill.  What to do  The turtle is pretty easy to build using the Sub-Object mode. It also intro- duces a few ideas about Materials in 3D. Like so many 3D objects we will start by creating a Box. Create a Box with four segments in every direction.  Note  We could build the turtle from half a sphere but there are three things I  wish  to  demonstrate  by  modeling  from  a  box.  Firstly  that  by  good manipulation at Sub-Object mode, round objects can be created, sec- ondly that the topology of your finished mesh can be crucial for mate- rials, and thirdly it is good practice to keep the polygon count down, and the pole of a sphere has far too many polygons for our needs.  Convert your box to an Editable Mesh and choose Vertex Selection. The ver- tices will light up blue. By marquee-selecting vertices, we are going to start creating the turtle shell. In front or side view, select the top layer of vertices and use the Scale tool to pull them together. Now use the top view to bring in  the  corners  to  something  more  like  an  egg  shape.  Keep  moving  the  vertices till you have a good-looking hemisphere  Figure 1.22 .   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 31  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  31  Figure 1.22 Making a turtle shell from a box  Top Tip This is a great tip for smoothing low polygonal meshes. Select polygon in  Sub-Object  mode  and  either  ‘Control  cid:3  A’,  or  marquee-select  them all, so they all turn red. Scroll down to the very bottom of the R-hand menu to Surface Properties and a box called Auto Smooth. The default for Auto Smooth is 45, but it can be cranked up to 180. Type in 180 and  hit  the  Auto  Smooth  button, the  shell  will  become  rounded  and smoother, without adding any more polygons.  Now we will pull up the bottom of the hemisphere to create a shell for the turtle. Select the whole bottom layer of vertices from a side view, and use the Scale tool to bring them closer together, now pull these vertices up to create a rounded lip to the shell. Tweak up some vertices to create room for head, legs and tail  Figure 1.23 .  Figure 1.23 The finished shell with gaps for the turtle’s body  To make the head, again start with a box, this time with height and width segments of 2  cid:4  2, and with five segments along the length. Once again, tweak the vertices to make a simple head shape. To make the legs, duplicate   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 32  32  3D for the Web  the head by Shift  cid:3  Moving it. Use the Uniform Scale tool to resize this suit- ably to serve as a leg, and then duplicate it three further times. Position the legs and the head under the shell and make a tail from a cone with eight sides and two height segments. Put the tail in place too  Figure 1.24 .  Figure 1.24 Positioning the turtle’s body  To create the mouth, we need to use the edge selection in Sub-Object mode. Select the head and in edge selection choose the four edges around where the mouth will be. In Edit Geometry in the R-hand menu, select Chamfer and crank it up a few increments. Each edge will divide into two parallel edges, creating a new polygon between them. Switch to polygon selection, and select all the new polygons  there will be four and the two new triangular faces at the corner vertices . Click on Extrude in Edit Geometry. To pull the polygons backwards, you must use a negative amount. Keep the polygons selected and use the Non-Uniform Scale tool to pull them inside the head.  Hint: Pressing the space bar locks and unlocks your selection   Figure 1.25 .  Figure 1.25 The turtle’s mouth   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 33  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  33  Now the turtle is looking pretty good, but it needs eyes and a tongue. For a tongue make a slim box and move the vertices to a good rounded tongue shape, pop it in the turtle’s mouth. Make one eyeball from a sphere with  12 segments. We will duplicate this to make the other eye, but before we do that, we will use another great material tool, the Multi Sub-Object Material.  Open the Material Editor and select a sample slot, click on Diffuse and set the material to a white or off-white shade, these will be our eyeballs. At the top right of this material’s parameters is a box labeled Standard, click on this and a Material Map Browser will pop up. Select Multi Sub-Object and a Replace Material box will appear. We want to keep our basic white as a Sub-Material, click ‘OK’ and you will see a number of material option slots have appeared. The default is 10, but you can have as many or as few as you like. The Multi Sub-Object Material is represented by colored segments on the sample sphere. Choose another sample slot and make it black  for the  pupils .  Drag  and  drop  that  onto  the  second  material  slot  in  the Multi Sub-Object Material  Figure 1.26 .  To translate the material appropriately to the eyeball you have made, select your eyeball and convert it to an Editable Mesh. Choose polygon selection and select all of the polygons, scroll down to the bottom of the R-hand menu to Surface Properties and under Material ID, type 1 to correspond to the white material slot number. Now select the polygons at the top segment and turn the material ID up to 2 for the black pupil. Leave Sub-Object mode and assign  your  Multi Sub-Object  Material  to  the  sphere.  The  white  will  be assigned just to those polygons that you selected and gave the ID 1, and the black will be assigned just to the polygons given the ID 2.  Note  Multi Sub-Object  Materials  can  be  crucial  in  exporting  things  with sophisticated  materials  to  Shockwave  3D,  and  we  will  be  covering that later in the book. Multi Sub-Object Materials are one of the few supported  material  types  alongside  standard  Blinn  shaders  that  will export properly. This is one reason why some thought must be given to the  underlying  mesh  of  anything  you  build  for  export.  The  polygons must  be  positioned  to  enable  a  Multi Sub-Object  Material  to  be assigned correctly.  Now duplicate your eyeball  Shift  cid:3  Move  to make a copy and position both eyes on the head.  Next we will apply a material to the turtle using a Bump map and UVW map- ping. Materials can only be fitted for export to the Web using UVW mapping.  I made a Bump map of a tortoise shell spiral in Photoshop, saved it as a .jpg. A Bump map is typically a gray-scale image that simulates mesh displacement   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 34  34  3D for the Web  Figure 1.26 Multi Sub-Object Material  without  changing  the  mesh.  When  you  render  an  object  with  a  Bump- mapped material, the impression is given of white areas protruding, and black areas receding.  To bring your map into the Material Editor, select a sample slot, and change the basic material to green, then scroll down to the Maps Roll Out. double- click  on  the  ‘None’  button  by  Bump  map  and  select  bitmap  from  the Material Map Browser. You can now browse for your .jpg bitmap. Open it in the Bump map slot, and crank up the Amount to almost as high as it can go.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 35  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  35  You should see it changing in the sample slot.  Hint: Double-clicking on a sample slot brings it up in a larger window for inspection   Figure 1.27 .  Figure 1.27 Grayscale Bump map. Bump map applied as a material  We want to assign this material to the turtle, to give it an interesting shell. We will do this by combining our knowledge of Multi Sub-Object Materials with a UVW map. Scroll down the Modifier List and add UVW map to the shell’s stack. The UVW map modifier controls how materials appear on the surface of an object by applying mapping coordinates to an object. These coordinates specify how bitmaps are projected onto an object. The UVW coordinate system is similar to the XYZ coordinate system. The U and V axes of  a  bitmap  correspond  to  the  X  and  Y  axes.  The  W-axis,  which  corre- sponds to the Z-axis, is rarely used. Under Parameters for UVW mapping, you will see different ways of fitting your map onto your selected object. In this case, we are going to select Face. This will assign our material to each polygon in our object’s structure.  If we had visible edges between the pairs of faces that make up a polygon, the material would be assigned to each triangular face.  Select Face, and assign the turtle-shell material to it.  You will not be able to view the effect of the Bump map unless you render.  You can see how important it is that the underlying mesh works for this tech- nique. A Sphere would have given us the wrong topology.  There is still one more thing to do to make the shell look good; anyone who has kept a turtle knows that whilst the top of the shell is ridged, the bottom of  the  shell  is  lighter  in  color  and  smoother.  Select  a  new  slot  in  your Material Editor and make a suitable material for the underside of the turtle shell. Go back to the original green material and Click on Standard to bring up the Material Browser. Make this material a Multi Sub-Object Material just as you did for the eyes, keeping your shell material as a Sub-Material. Drag and drop the under-shell material into the second Sub-Material slot.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 36  36  3D for the Web  Enter Sub-Object mode, select all the polygons in the shell and give them an ID of 1. Now select the polygons on the underside of the turtle. Give them an ID of 2, and the underside will take on the correct material. Choose a nice color or material for the legs, tail and head, and color the tongue in.  It is good practice to label each part of your finished model, as it is hard to identify one box from another, later on. You can re-label any mesh by high- lighting the text and typing in a new label  Figure 1.28 .  Figure 1.28 Finished turtle and list of scene contents  Your turtle is finished and just needs animating. In this case we will stay with the default lighting, to keep the turtle looking cartoony and child-friendly.  How to animate a turtle button For the purposes of creating the simplest button animation, we will need to have our turtle in three states: dormant in his shell, out ready for action and squashed. Now is a good time to set up a camera, as we want to ‘lock off’ the scene so it will animate smoothly when the three stills are put onto the Web, and unlike the button, we will probably need to use the perspective viewport to animate.  Click on Create  cid:2  Camera. You will see there are two sorts, Free and Target. Select the Target Camera as they allow you more control as you can posi- tion the camera and the target. Click and drag in the top viewport to create a camera and its target. Obviously the target needs to be on your turtle, but   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 37  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  37  you can position your camera anywhere that gives a nice angle on your subject.  Hint: If you click in a viewport and type ‘c’ it will become a view- port of the camera. Typing ‘p’ will return you to perspective.   Although most of our turtle can be animated freely, just as the button, there is one thing we should do to ensure that the eyeballs stay with the head. In the top tool bar there is tool called ‘Select and Link’  Figure 1.29 .  Figure 1.29 The Select and Link tool in 3D Studio Max  Click on it and pick an eyeball. Link it to the turtle’s head by dragging the line and clicking on the head. Do the same to the other eyeball. Now if you Move, Rotate or Scale the head, the eyeballs will inherit the same parameters.  Note  By linking one object to another, you create a parent–child relation- ship,  or  hierarchy.  Transformations  applied  to  the  parent  are  also transmitted to the child object. By linking more objects to both parent and child objects, you can create complex hierarchies. Chains can be created to include ancestors  parents’ parents  and descendants  chil- dren’s children . All complex animation uses the same technique. It is a way of animating called Forward Kinematics.  We need three states for our turtle, and currently it should be in a good posi- tion for the second state, apart from the tongue. So turn on the Auto Key and let us start animating. Move the slider to frame 15 and position the tongue inside the shell. Click on each leg, in turn and under Motion, Click on Position to create a Key. Do the same for the tail. Create a Position key for the tongue hidden inside the body. Now go to frame 20 and create a head  Position  and  Rotation  key.  When  you  choose  the  eyeballs  create Position, Rotation and Scale keys at frame 20, and click on the shell and create a Scale key.  Put the time slider at frame 0. In the top viewport, slide all the limbs and  the tail back into the turtle’s shell, so none can be seen. Do the same to the head – the eyeballs will go with it. Because Auto Key is still on, you have now created your first two button states.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 38  38  3D for the Web  Now move the time slider to frame 30. We are going to make that turtle road kill! Pull out the legs, tail and head a bit more. Slide the tongue into the mouth. Rotate the eyeballs inwards to make the turtle cross-eyed, and use Uniform Scale to make one larger and more popped out. For the crum- pled shell, stay in Auto Key and with the shell selected at the Editable Mesh stage, go to Sub-Object mode  cid:2  vertices. Make sure that ‘Ignore Backfacing’ is checked and also ‘Soft Selection’. Select the six or so vertices at the top of the shell.  Hint: pressing Control adds vertices to a selection and pressing Alt takes them away without losing those you have already chosen.  Adjust the slider in Soft Selection so that its range picks up the surrounding vertices  they will turn orange yellow . In a side view pull the selected vertices down to create a dip in the turtle’s shell.  Now by rendering frames 0, 20 and 30 you have created your three but- ton states for export and Dreamweaver  Figure 1.30 .  Figure 1.30 The finished three states for Dreamweaver  If we want to render the whole animation to get in-betweens and a smoother animation to export as a series of PNGs, we will have to refine this anima- tion a bit. The PNGs get converted to JPGs in Flash, but we might want to keep the alpha transparency at the moment.  Note  Because I come from a traditional animation background, I think of ani- mation at the 16 mm filmic rate of 24 fps, or PAL rate  25 fps  or NTSC  30 fps . At 24 fps each 100 frames is roughly equal to 4 seconds. Later on  in  the  book  we  will  be  talking  about  cutting  down  on  file  sizes, which will mean reducing the frame rate.  Because 3D animation data are represented by Bezier curves, unless we control the Keyframes, the animation will float from one Keyframe to the next. Fortunately there are some easy tools to control this. Select a leg from the turtle. You should have created 3 Keyframes at 0, 15 and 30. Take the middle Keyframe at 15 and slide it back to frame 10. Use the Key Mode toggle to make sure you are on the Keyframe and click the Motion button, so you can view the PRS Parameters in the R-hand menu. Under Position and Key Info  basic  you will see two Bezier tangents. These have rollouts to different Key controllers, each representing graph lines of movement  Figure 1.31 .   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:58  Page 39  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  39  Figure  1.31 Keyframe  Controllers  cid:2  Position  Keys.  Default  and  with  applied  controllers  The default is always Bezier, but for this particular Keyframe we want the leg to ease in to a hold  Step .  Top Tip These Keyframe controllers can seem very confusing to someone new to  animation.  The  simplest  way  to  look  at  it  is:  The  more  vertical  a graph line is; the faster the movement. And the more horizontal; the slower the movement. So a horizontal line is a hold, and a vertical line represents a sudden transition from one frame to the next.  Duplicate this key by Shift-moving it and drag the new key to frame 20. Change the Controllers to Step and Linear. That means the leg will hold its position until frame 20, then speed into the next key  Figure 1.32 .  Now play your animation again and you will see that the leg you have con- trolled will have a much more realistic feel to its motion. Do the same to all the other limbs and the tail. In my animation, I have staggered the legs com- ing out, so that there is a gap of two frames as they emerge. It is often effec- tive to stagger motion in this way, as we seldom move synchronistically.  The main point here is to add a Keyframes to give holds to animation and use the controllers to give it snap and realism. I added in some more Rotation Keyframes  to  the  head  to  make  it  scoop  out  of  the  shell  and  give  the    Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 40  40  3D for the Web  Note  Figure 1.32 Applied controllers for the new key at frame 20  eyeballs room. You can view the finished animation on the website and the file is on the CD.  The Rotation and Scale keys have the same controllers in Max 5. All programs have some way of controlling the animation, and it is impos- sible to avoid using some sort of control if you want to achieve good movement. Later tutorials in this book will take you a bit deeper into how to control animation. Animation is a massive subject, and I am only skimming the surface here with some basic skills. All animation is a matter of timing and observation; there are many excellent books on the subject if you are interested in honing your skills.  Render your finished animation at a size of 120 pixels wide and 100 pix- els high, position the turtle to fill up the screen by adjusting the Camera that you previously created. Save the image sequences as PNGs.  Converting our turtle into an  animated button We have already made an animated button in Flash, this time we are going to use a slightly different method to achieve the same result. The reason for   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 41  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  41  this is to make a better introduction to Action Scripting. The more compli- cated the interactivity is going to be, the more you will have to do some scripting,  it  is  unavoidable,  but  very  useful.  Hopefully  you  will  find  this method simpler than the previous one.  In Flash, create a New Symbol, a Movie Clip  not a button  and name it ‘tur- tle button’. You will jump straight into it on the timeline. Then import all of the frames that we created as PNGs in our 3D package. You just need to double-click on the first one for you to be prompted to import the range. You might need to import the second range of frames separately if the numbers did not run on consecutively. Now the frames are in, create stop commands on the first, ‘middle’ and last frames. If you cannot remember, click on the frame,  get  the  Action  window  up,  select  Actions  cid:2  Movie  Control  and  double-click on Stop. The middle frame refers to the frame where the turtle’s head has popped out and settled down, not the middle of the time line.  Whilst we are inside the turtle button symbol, we can add some sounds.  I am going to use two sounds, a whistle sound when he pops out and a raspberry  sound  when  he  is  pressed.  Import  these  two  sounds   or  your own . And then position them on frame 2 and the frame after the ‘middle’ frame, by clicking on the frame and selecting the sound in the Properties window  Figure 1.33 .  Figure 1.33 Inserting a sound into the timeline  Once you have inserted the sounds you want, click back on Scene 1. You will see that there is no button on the page. We need to get the Library palette up and drag an instance of our turtle button onto the page. Also set the Document Properties to match the size of the rendered image size. In our case 120 wide by 100 high. When you have dragged it on, you will see  in  the  Properties  window  that  there  is  an  opportunity  to  name  the instance. Give it an individual name as this is good practice particularly if you use the button several times, but want to link it to different pages.  Now for the scripting bit. R-click on the turtle and bring up the Action window. Click on Actions  cid:2  Movie Control and double-click the ‘On’ command. You   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 42  42  3D for the Web  will see a list of options appear with the Release option checked, uncheck it and check Roll Over. Then double-click on Play, this will insert in under the text in the script window. This will start your animation when the mouse rolls over the turtle.  Click  on  line  3  and  then  double-click  the  On  command.  Uncheck  the Release  option  and  check  the  Press  option,  then  double-click  the  Goto option. Make sure Goto and Play is checked and change the frame number to 23  the frame after the ‘middle’ frame . This will make sure that the turtle will squash, no matter what the state of the animation is.  Click on line 6 and double-click the On command. Uncheck the Release option and check the Roll Out option. Double-click the Goto option. Make sure Goto and Stop is checked and make sure the frame number is at 1. This will reset the animation when the mouse leaves the button. Figure 1.34 shows you the end result of this piece of programming. You can now test the button to see it move when you rollover and squash when you press on it.  Figure 1.34 Scripting the button   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 43  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  43  In our previous attempt at creating a button we made it into a link using Dreamweaver. This time we will do it in Flash. Make sure you are clicked on line 9. Double-click the On command as before, but leave the Release option checked. Now click on Browser Network, below the Movie Control command, you will see a command called getURL. Double-click getURL and type  in  the  address  of  the  page  you  want  to  link  to,  e.g.  http:   www.3dfortheWeb.info. You can select below that, whether you want it to replace  the  current  window   _self   or  create  a  new  window   _blank   to place the page in  Figure 1.35 .  Figure 1.35 Making the button into a hyperlink  And that’s it, when you import your file in Dreamweaver you do not need to make it into a link as it is already one. Of course this might not prove to be your preferred method, but if your site is entirely in Flash, and not just a Flash button, then this is the obvious method to choose.  That’s it for the turtle as a button, but do not worry, he will be back in later chapters.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 44  44  3D for the Web  Interview with Mach-Parat http:  www.mach-parat.de  Company profile  Mach-Parat  is  a  young,  innovative  German  company  that  specializes  in Flash-based games. They started in August 2002, and had already won the games category at the Online Flash Film Festival OFFF03 in Barcelona less than a year later. Mach-Parat’s team consists of Volker Neumann, Jan-Philipp Behrens and Sebastian Deimann.  I first encountered Mach-Parat through their very different looking ‘In the Woods’  game  and  have  had  opportunity  to  enjoy  their  clever  ideas  in games  and  viral  marketing  ever  since,  including  their  rather  wonderful Easter idea for self promotion, The Pixel Egg, which is as a very elegant piece of viral marketing.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 45  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  45  Interview  This interview is with Jan-Philipp Behrens, one of the three permanent mem- bers of the company.  Can you describe the background to your company, its aims, ambitions, client base? Volker Neumann and I met while we worked for a small design company and started some projects. We never had any ambition to work for a larger company and so we started our own business.  We always try to be innovative and look out for new challenges. We want to produce applications that are as attractive as possible. It is nice if a client is satisfied, but what satisfies us are e-mails from users saying that they like what we do. And last but not least we want to have fun while working.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 46  46  3D for the Web  Typically how many people would work on a project? Most of the time all three of us are involved, although we do sometimes draw from a small pool of freelancers. There have been some jobs with only two people involved, but there is no meeting without all three of us, because communication is an important point of our work. There are a lot of cross- over skills between us, that does not mean that everyone is as good as the other, but it is important for our work that everybody knows what is possi- ble to realize and what is not. We are not specialists, but generalists.  General design and 3D How did you get started working in 3D Flash games? It was the time when everybody was working with Flash and Freehand vec- tor style. Vector illustrations were used on every magazine cover and in many TV commercials. That was the point we decided to start with 3D. It was learning by doing. We began to mix 3D style with vector style and what we got was a cute little surrounding that had much more toy appeal than all the others we did before. It was a toy world like LEGO or Playmobil that said, ‘Play with me’. Especially for games, it is necessary to create such an attractive surrounding.  How do you come up with the different ideas for your games? Some of the game ideas are influenced by our clients. The challenge here is to find the right game genre including a solid and convincing story and a graphic style that fits best to the company’s corporate design. A helpful tool to come up with ideas and concepts is to build a large archive of different styles and game engines. Internet research helps a lot and it is useful to have a look at the games of the 1980s home computers like the Commodore C64. There are a lot of simple but addictive games waiting to be modified.  Good-looking 3D has an immediate appeal. Do you see it as the way for- ward in Web design, or just another tool? 3D is just another tool in Web design and at the moment a really strong one, because a new one. And sure it got advantages over the 2D applications on the Web, because it can create spaces which seem to be more realistic. The reason why 3D in the Web is getting bigger and bigger is the result of faster online connections. These allow everybody to be part of the 3D vir- tual reality. Faster connections are the gigantic step forward for the Web. They offer new ways to spread information. And 3D is one of those ways.  How important do you think interactivity is to your work? Interactivity  is  the  most  important  part  of  your  productions.  We  are  not really into linear movies and stories. Interactivity is what fills the user with   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 47  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  47  enthusiasm and what makes a product attractive. Little interactive gimmicks and small interactive tools have to be in all of our productions.  On  average  how  long  do  you  spend  developing  your  games  and  how much of that time is pre-production? The process of developing a game takes between 2 and 6 weeks, depending on the complexity. A serious pre-production takes at least 20% of the work.  How important is sound in your games and who handles that? The sound is a very important part of a game for two reasons. On one hand it creates the atmosphere and on the other hand it gives a response to the player. Every game takes place in a little virtual world. To make the world easy to understand  you  need  to  build  a  specific  atmosphere.  Is  it  a  dangerous world or is it a friendly one. The atmospheric sound supports the story and the graphics. And the other point is the response. A usual computer has no chance to give a haptic response, so the user often does not know if he has pressed a but- ton  already  or  not.  That  is  the  reason  why  most  buttons  play  a  specific sound when they are clicked. In games we have to handle the same prob- lem. In a fast game the player often does not realize if he has collected an item already or not and he does not know how much time he has left to com- plete the level. The sound offers him the information he needs without break- ing the game flow. Try to play a game and turn off the sound and you will see that it is more difficult to succeed. The sound makes the little virtual world look more realistic, makes it easier to understand its rules and supports the feeling of being part of the game. A lot of the sounds for our games are recorded and done by Sebastian Deimann.  What aspect of development would you say is the most time consuming? The most time consuming part of the game development is the graphic and animation, in some cases it takes up to 50% of the whole process.  Your past and future work Your games reflect a number of different graphic styles who what are your influences? We  are  influenced  by  a  lot  of  things  and  people:  Der  Bauer,  Star  Wars, Rodney Mathews, C 64 and old video game consoles, Mad Magazin, John Maeda, Gorillaz Video, fairy tales, LEGO, Eboy, Lobo, Toy Story and Chalet.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 48  48  3D for the Web  Out of all the 3D Flash games you have created which was your most chal- lenging, and why? The most challenging 3D game we did is ‘In the Woods’. Actually it was produced as an interactive greeting card for Christmas we send out to com- panies and friends. We did not want to do anything with Santa Clauses or red nosed reindeers and we came up with a story with little fairies. The  application  shows  a  large  old  gnarled  tree  surrounded  by  glittering snow. Small lights are flying around the tree like fire flies and some of them are heading towards the ‘camera’ and you recognize that they are fairies. The User has got the possibility to take a short movie of the scenery and to watch it afterwards in ‘Super 8’ Movie style.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 49  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  49  The  challenge  here  was  not  the  3D  elements  themselves  or  the  ‘movie- engine’ but to create a mystic, fascinating and realistic surrounding which was a mixture of different software exports. If you work with a mixture of different graphic parts, e.g. Photoshop works, 3D modeling and Flash animations the challenge is to bring those parts together in the right way so that they fit. Often it takes a while to synchro- nize  3D  elements  and  programming.  For  example,  it  took  us  hours  and hours to synchronize the Flash-ants on the turning 3D trunk for the game ‘Antburner’.  What awards have you won and have they made a difference? We were nominated as a finalist at the Flash Forward Flash Film Festival in San Francisco in March 2003 and we have won the games category at Online Flash Film Festival OFFF03 in Barcelona in May 2003. And yes, the awards made a difference. An award shows that your work is innovative. For some clients it is important to know what other clients you have worked for to see if you are serious. But that does not say anything about innovation. An award does. An award is a good argument to get commissions. It is nice to have the official award icons on our website. A  Why are your games so important to clients and their websites? The production of online games is booming in contrast to all other Web productions.  The  main  reasons  are  that  a  game  makes  a  website  more attractive and people do stay longer on the sites. The games are for free and offer fun, so that the player consumes the advertising for a product or a  company  of  his  own  accord.  On  the  radio  or  on  TV  people  have  no chance to decide if they want to hear or see commercials or not. Here they have and that has a good effect on the company appearance and builds up an emotional relationship between the player and the company. The possi- bility of recommending the game to another person with a ‘Tell-A-Friend’ function spreads out the game and company profits of the so-called viral marketing. If you add up all these facts and compare it with the costs of other kinds of advertising the production of a Web game is very cheap.  Any special future projects using 3D? A future project in a soccer game for a large sports Web portal in Germany. It will be again a mixture of different software exports. The characters will be 3D modeled and then animated in Poser. The user can set his team strategy and challenge others via e-mail. We’ve already started on this project. Watch out for Microsoccer.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 50  50  3D for the Web  Technique Why did you choose to use Flash? Flash has got one big advantage over other software. The plug-in is small and widely used. That is an important fact for the clients, because they want people to enter their website without having to download anything before they can access it. This is although the reason why all our productions run in the Flash 5 Player.  What other software do you use for creating your games? The main software we use is Photoshop, Cinema 4D, Poser and Swift 3D. Most of our games are done with them. Sometimes we use Freehand but Flash has got strong graphic tools too.  Were there any specific problems you had to overcome? We have to take care of a small file size and good performance.  Does it vary from project to project? Yes, one time the file size makes the problems and the other time it is the per- formance A. There is rarely a production without one of the two problems.   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 51  Chapter 1 – 3D for beginners: basic buttons  51  How much programming do you use and do you view it as an important skill for designers to have? We do progam a lot, for us it is a very important skill. There is no interac- tivity without programming. The programming sometimes takes the half time of one job. I think everybody who has anything to do with Web design should know what is possible on the Web and with which conditions. I am talking about the  old  story  about  graphic  designers  and  programmers:  The  graphic designer asks if it is possible to launch the Web concept he made. And the programmer says that it is possible, because nearly everything is possible, but not with the small budget of the job. What I want to say is that it is an advantage when the skills cross-over, because Web design goes hand in hand with programming.  How does creating 3D games for the Web differ from creating standard commercial computer games? One big difference is the file size. We do not want people to load more than 1 megabyte large games. Even if the connections are getting faster. One reason why Web games are so popular is that the users have to wait just a few seconds and then they can have fun, so it is important. The most difficult  part  of  our  work  to  find  the  right  combination  of  small  file  size, good-looking graphics and a good performance. In contrast to standard computer games an online game has to be low in complexity and simple to understand. The user should look at it the first time and immediately he should know the aim of the game and how to play it. Online games are made for the short fun during the day. Nobody wants to fool around with difficult key combinations or wants to read instructions that are longer than 20 lines.  How do you integrate 3D elements into your Flash games? Most of the 3D elements are fake: short picture sequences, modeled and rendered with any 3D software often including alpha channel and imported into Flash. The challenge is to combine all the different parts in Flash so that it looks natural. Does the light come from the right place, are the proportions okay and do all animations fit together like we wanted them to fit?  Insights Which technology do you think will be the leader for 3D on the Web?  For example, Shockwave, Flash, Pulse 3D, Virtools, Anark  In  my  opinion  Flash  is  the  leading  one  right  now,  because  of  the  large spreading of the small size plug-in. Most of 3D elements on the Web are   Chap-01.qxd  8 12 04  14:59  Page 52  52  3D for the Web  done with Flash. But Flash has a very big disadvantage: It has nearly nothing to do with 3D. There is no 3D engine like Shockwave has got. To compete in the future 3D Web market Flash will need such an engine, otherwise Flash will be pseudo 3D software for ever, and will lose its big share of market. In future I think Shockwave will be the leading technology for 3D on the Web. The spreading of its plug-in is making good progress. The Shockwave 3D engine is a strong tool. We already started to get into Director. I am looking forward to the first Mach-Parat Shockwave release.  Do you have any advice for students of 3D Web design? Everything is possible. Look for the biggest challenge you can imagine for the specific production. Work so long on one project till you hate it. One month after the project is finished you will love it. And most of all have fun.  3D has almost taken over the games industry do you think it will become more predominant in Web games? 3D  is  growing  on  the  Web.  It  is  an  enormous  element  of  the  so-called immersion  describes the phenomenon that people leave reality and dive into a virtual space . Immersion is the most important reason why 3D has overtaken the games industry.

Hopefully you have experimented and come up with some interesting but- tons of your own, after all, it is your creativity that will make an impressive website. We have said that web pages are basically just buttons and infor- mation, whether that is text, pictures or audio. Of course, this is the basis of Internet communication, the idea of the hyperlink where pages of text are joined to other pages by means of an addressed link. The Web is a non- linear construction, unlike books, so when creating websites there need not always be a beginning, middle and end. Although you may have an initial page to your site, it is always possible for people to jump in at any point, thanks to the automatic trawling of search engines. This is one of unique things about the Web, it can be difficult to control the user’s actions. In films and books, although you could skip back and forth, people are going to start at the beginning and work their way through to the end. In designing websites you have to be aware that people might join halfway through, so   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 54  54  3D for the Web  you need to give them clear opportunities to work out what to do. This might be using an obvious button that allows people to go back to the beginning of the site. If you do not feel that they need to do this then you need to have a continuity of design throughout your site and an interface that is easy to understand and intuitive.  We will get on with a large practical exercise and then talk more about the interface and 3D representation towards the end of this chapter.  Creating a product-based 3D website There are ways of using 3D on the Web where you can employ all the bells and whistles of your favorite 3D package. You can create some great 3D graphics or recreate realistic products. For the purposes of the next exer- cise, we have created a hypothetical product: MacHead’s One Dose, solu- ble  aspirin.  We  are  going  to  use  a  variety  of  interesting  graphics  and animations that will help sell the product to the user and explain its purpose. The ideas are the main thing here, and you are unlikely to want to create the same sort of animations, so the explanations of the 3D work will be more general than before.  Let us imagine that we have been given a current product package. The challenge is to get this product across in a website using 3D to sell it. The product looks like Figure 2.1 and a single tablet like Figure 2.2.  Figure 2.1 MacHead’s package design   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 55  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  55  Figure 2.2 The product  Before we do anything, it is important to think about the web page color and the color scheme in general. The actual package is designed in blue, white and gold. It makes sense to borrow the color scheme from the pack- aging, and use white as a background. White gives a nice, clean clinical feel, suitable for a medicine. First let us deal with the most obvious idea.  Exercise: a realistic approach to 3D Recreate the product package and make a realistic simulation of the tablet dropping into a glass of water and dissolving, using 3D.  What to do  The  product  package  was  created  from  an  Extended  Primitive  cid:2  Chamferbox.  This  is  like  an  ordinary  3D  box  with  chamfered  edges. The reason for having chamfered edges is that no surface in real life has such sharp corners as your 3D program. Look around you now and you should see that table edges, book spines and the keys on your keyboard all catch a soft light at their edges. We want the package to look realistic, and so the edges need softening to mimic reality. Naturally the proportions of the chamferbox must match the proportions of the real packet. The graphic was made in Photoshop, but could be scanned from a real product  or for better  resolution,  digitally  photographed   and  saved  as  a  TIFF  file.  It  is important that you create a map that incorporates the top and side views of the package.  To bring the graphic into 3D Studio Max, open the Material Editor, choose a sample slot and click ‘None’ in the Maps Rollout next to Diffuse Color. Select bitmap from the pop-up menu and browse for your graphic. Your graphic will appear as a map at 100% in the Diffuse Channel. Select the Bump map channel, click on ‘None’ and select Noise. The Map Parameters will appear in the Material Editor.  Hint: You can travel up and down the layers of the Material Editor via the ‘Show End Result’ and ‘Go to Parent’ buttons  Figure 2.3 .    Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 56  56  3D for the Web  Figure 2.3 The Show End Result and Go to Parent buttons  Tile the noise map in all directions by a factor of 10. Click on ‘Go to Parent’ and take the Bump map amount down to 5. This should just take the edge off  the  graphic’s  crispness  and  imitate  the  cardboard  quality  of  the  real  life box.  To apply the material to the chamferbox, add a UVW map to its modifier stack and fit the material as a Box map to a good position on the face of the box. Remember that you need to adjust the map to fit at the bottom right so the front of the box will look correct, but the edge faces will need work to make them fit. We will only see three sides of the box, so will ignore the back faces. Add a Mesh Select modifier from the Modifier List and select the side polygons and the small polygons created by the chamfer above it. Add another UVW map and open it out to use the Gizmo to fit the same map to the side  Figure 2.4 . The selected faces will turn red and the Gizmo can be scaled, positioned and rotated just as any other object. Match the pattern  Figure 2.4 The selected faces and Gizmo for fitting the side map   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 57  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  57  so that it matches the front graphic, and then add another Mesh Select and UVW map to do the same for the top of the box  remembering to add the smaller polygons created by the chamfer to your selection .  This can be quite fiddly, but persevere; the box should now be seamlessly mapped to match the package.  Note  Those of you who are lucky enough to have the most up-to-date software will have another modifier that could help in fitting materials: the Unwrap UVW modifier. We will be using this later on in the book.  R-click at the top of the modifier stack and choose Collapse All. This will lock the UVW mapping. Save the package scene, and File  cid:2  Reset to start a new scene.  Now we will create the rest of our realistic scene and the animation.  We will bring the box into this scene later.  The first thing to do is make a tablet. This is made from a mesh smoothed cylinder with a slot cut into it using Compound  objects  cid:2  Boolean.  Booleans  are  operators  used  to  subtract, intersect or add surfaces, in this case, a slim box with a ‘V’ at one end is subtracted from the cylinder  Figure 2.5 .  Figure 2.5 Creating a channel in the tablet using Boolean  Materials for realistic simulation are very important. The tablet is white with a tiled noise map in the Bump map channel. This gives the tablet a slightly granular effect. There is no shine to the tablet as soluble pills have no sugar coating.  I have decided to keep the glass simple, as I do not want to detract from the tablet dissolving. There are any number of ways of modeling such a simple   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 58  58  3D for the Web  glass. I have drawn half the glass as a spline, and used the Lathe modifier to bring it into three dimensions  Figure 2.6 .  Figure 2.6 Using the Lathe modifier to create the glass  Meshsmooth  the  finished  model  twice,  and  Shift-Move  to  create  a  copy. Turn the copy into an Editable Mesh and eliminate the outside to create the water. Collapse the top layer of vertices and use the Uniform Scale to scale down the water a tiny amount so it will fit snugly into your glass.  There  are  several  methods  by  which  you  can  create  the  appearance  of glass, the most realistic is to use the Raytrace material. Go to Rendering  cid:2  Material  Editor  to  bring  up  the  materials  if  they  are  not  already  visible. Select a blank material and click the button that says Standard. Change it to Raytrace from the list then shown. Change the Diffuse Color to a pale blue. This will help the glass be seen against the white background, and is more for effect than reality. Also deselect the Transparency check box and then change the Transparency value to 95. This will make it almost com- pletely transparent, but with a pale blue color.  Make sure the index of refraction value is set to 1.5, which roughly matches the amount that glass refracts light. Click the Reflect check box until it reads ‘Fresnel’, which mimics the reflection quality of glass. Still in the glass mate- rial, open the Raytracer controls panel and make sure that Raytraced reflec- tion and refraction anti-aliaser to switched on. This will give a better quality result inside the reflections and refractions, as the pixels will be smoothed.  The material for the water is going to be pretty much the same as for the glass, but change the index of refraction to 1.33. As the water is thicker than the glass, it will have a much greater distortion even though it has a lower index of refraction.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:00  Page 59  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  59  Note  Using Raytrace does considerably slow down the rendering time of your animation, but it is worth it for the quality of result you get.  With so many shiny, transparent surfaces, lighting is a crucial factor in mak- ing  your  scene  look  the  way  you  want  it.  Make  the  environment   back- ground  color white, to match with the white web page. This will allow the graphic to float cleanly on site. Keep on making test renders until you have the  look  you  desire.  I  have  added  a  plane  as  a  floor  and  used  a Matte Shadow material on it so that the shadow will be visible, but the plane will not. This will help delineate the glass on the page. Position a cam- era in the scene to look at the glass and change the perspective viewport to that camera’s viewpoint  Figure 2.7 .  Figure 2.7 The rendered glass  Animate the tablet falling into the glass.  Hint: It will be slowed and redirected by the water.  From the Modifier List, add Melt to the stack. Use the Glass Melt effect and animate your tablet melting away. By adding a Visibility ani- mation key to this, we can get a good effect of the tablet dissolving.  To add a Visibility track, R-click the object in the viewport and pick Curve Editor. A new window will pop up: this is the Curve Editor.  Note  The Curve Editor or Track view represents all the animated parameters you have given an object in graph form. It is like an expansion of the timescale  slide  rule  which  runs  along  the  bottom  of  your  screen,  and offers  alternate  ways  of  adjusting  any  animation  keys  in  your  scene. Adjusting the Key Interpolation here will change the curve of your ani- mation. The Visibility track is a simple way into understanding this com- plex tool, which is at the heart of animation control.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 60  60  3D for the Web  From the Tracks drop down in the menu bar, pick Visibility track  cid:2  Add. A Visibility track will appear below your object  Figure 2.8 .  Figure 2.8 Adding a Visibility track in the Curve Editor  Select  Add  keys  and  create  two  keys  for  your  tablet,  one  for  when  you  want it to start disappearing and one for it to have dissolved completely.  Because we are using this in combination with the Melt modifier, we do not want the tablet to disappear too soon.   When you first assign a Visibility track to an object, a Bezier float controller is automatically assigned as the default controller. By R-clicking on the keys, you can change the interpolation of the Visibility keys  just as you did for the turtle’s PRS keys in Chapter 1 .  We want to hold the tablet’s Visibility, and then ease into it disappearing.  R-click on the first key you created and type in the value 1.  For Visibility, 1  cid:3  Fully visible and 0  cid:3  Vanished.  Select the ‘Step’  hold  tangency for your first interpolation and an ‘Ease Out’ for the second  Figure 2.9 . You should see the curve of your animation in the Curve Editor change. Advance  Figure 2.9 Interpolations for the first Visibility key   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 61  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  61  to the second Visibility key and this time choose an ‘Ease In’ and a ‘Step Out’ interpolation, at value 0.  Your curve should resemble that of Figure 2.8.   Next we will add some Particle Clouds  PClouds  to simulate the tablet dis- persing. Create  cid:2  Particle Systems  cid:2  PCloud. Choose a Cylinder emitter and Click and drag in the top viewport to create the cylinder that will contain your PCloud.  Hint: You may also choose any mesh object as your emitter, e.g. your tablet, but in this case, we want more control of the bubbles as we do not want them floating through the glass!   There are a lot of different parameters for particles, but if you work through them methodically, they are quite logical and many can be ignored. The particle  parameters  I  have  chosen  are  Particle  Type  cid:2  Standard  Sphere, I have assigned the icon a suitable material, and timed the particle animation.  Hint: If your computer is not very powerful, it is often better to use a ‘Particle Total’ rather than ‘Rate’ as it allows you more control and stops your com- puter crashing; rates can multiply alarmingly.  The only other parameter that needs to be altered is the particles’ direction vector  Figure 2.10 .  I  have  animated  the  emitting  cylinder’s  size  during  the  animation,  and copied it to add two more PClouds with slight variation in material and size.   Figure 2.10 The PCloud particle generation rollout   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 62  62  3D for the Web  Top Tip Adding extra versions with small variations can help particle systems seem more random and less digitally generated.  Again, the only way of checking that the look you are achieving is correct is to keep on rendering and checking. There are too many factors at work here for the viewport to give you an accurate picture. Figure 2.11 shows a rendered still of the final shot.  Figure 2.11 The tablet dissolving  Note  I have used an advertising trick to add subtly to the product’s enhance- ment. By adding an Omni Light inside the glass and increasing the light within the glass as the tablet effervesces, I have lent it a slightly magical edge. There are other additions one could make in the interests of magic or realism. For instance, adding a splash and ripples. Anything is possi- ble in 3D.  Adding ripples  To add a ripple to the water, select it and use the Ripple modifier. Set Auto Key on, and go to the frame where the pill hits the water. Change the phase very slightly and change it back to 0. This will create two keys, one on frame 0 and one on the frame you are on. Then move on three or four frames and change the amplitude 1 and 2 values to around 100 and 80 or whatever value you think correctly approximates a splash. Then go to frame 90 or so and change the phase to 7, still with Auto Key on. Change the amplitudes to 0 now. This will stop your water appearing to ripple. You might  want  to  put  another  key  in  between  the  third  and  fourth  to  better    Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 63  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  63  represent your ripple splash. You should see your water splash and ripple now,  and  settle  down.  The  settling  down  is  important  if  you  want  your  animation to loop.  Merging the box and glass  Now let us merge the previous MacHead’s package into the scene. From the Top menu choose File  cid:2  Merge. A browse window will pop up, find the package  scene  and  select  the  chamferbox.  Click  ‘OK’  and  the  box  will appear in your scene. It will not necessarily be at the correct size and will certainly need rotating and positioning. You may well wish to re-adjust your camera and will need to add lights and move existing lights to make the box look good. This is where Raytracing can really help add to the scene as now the glass and water have something to reflect and refract. The lights I have used in my scene have Shadow Mapped shadows. They are rela- tively quick to render and have soft edges, making them look fairly natural. There are other types of shadows possible, and also the idea of Global Illumination   where  light  that  bounces  off  objects  is  calculated .  This  can improve the realism of your scene, but has the downside of being processor intensive, and hence slowing down the rendering time.  When you are happy with the look of your scene then you are ready to ren- der it. Choose Save File from the Render Scene window and select portable network graphic  PNG  for the save option, make sure the default 24-bit option is selected. Render all 100 or so frames. These will be imported into Flash in order to create your web page  Figure 2.12 .  Figure 2.12 The finished scene  Of course the reason that a realistic approach is the most obvious approach is because it interprets the instructions on the packet to illustrate how the   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 64  64  3D for the Web  product is used. It has a classical look drawn from television advertising, and usefully means that a visitor can understand it regardless of text. There are other ways of approaching the product depending on how we wish to get it across. Let us suppose for instance that we want a web page that shows what a fun company MacHead’s is, and at the same time implants knowl- edge of how great and effective ‘One Dose’ is. For this sort of identity, it seems like a good idea might be to have a character and a game. So meet Headache Jake and his dancing pills.  Exercise: the fun approach to 3D Creating a character and designing an animated sequence for a simple game or activity.  What to do  I have created Jake from a polygonal modeling. Believe it or not, like the tortoise, he started as a box. He was made by me for a previous animation, where he had lots of hair, but it is easier for this exercise if he is practically bald as in Figure 2.13. You can use the file of Jake from the CD, or make a head of your own.  Figure 2.13 Headache Jake   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 65  Note  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  65  If, like many others, intricate modeling is difficult for you, then there are ways to access models made by others via the Internet, Poser or models that  come  with  your  package.  These  models  can  be  brought  into  your program and adjusted to suit your needs. There are some sources listed at the end of this book. When using models other than your own, it is essential that you regard the laws of copyright and do not infringe them in any way. There are a lot of generous people on the Web, but it will only stay like that if we do not abuse it.  Jake looks a bit hung-over and ripe for a headache, doesn’t he? Thinking about the brief for a fun page and how to graphically depict a headache, I have decided to create an animation where Jake appears, gets a wince- inducing headache in the form of a gold band around his brow and then shakes  it  off.  The  main  new  animation  tool  we  are  going  to  use  is  the Morpher  modifier.  This  is  a  wonderful  way  of  smoothly  animating  facial expressions including lip sync but can be used for so much more.  Jake is an Editable Mesh, and before we add the Morpher modifier we will create four duplicates of him that we will use as Morph targets. Whenever the Morpher modifier is used, the topology of the targets must be the same as that of the original, so we cannot animate Jake by changing the number of vertices or polygons he has.  Select Jake’s head and Shift-Move to create four more copies of him, these will be our targets. Now use soft selection to start giving him a headache. Furrow his brows and start squeezing his brow by band selecting the ver- tices and uniform scaling them in. Move on to the next target and make him really suffer. Now let us give him a surprised look as relief hits, and for the finale a happy smile of relief  Figure 2.14 .  Figure 2.14 The 5 Jakes. One original and four targets for the Morpher modifier  When moving the vertices it is a good idea to mimic the facial expressions and check what happens to your features in a mirror. See how eyes and eyebrows are affected. He looks pretty strange right now, partly because   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 66  66  3D for the Web  the eyeballs are linked to the original, so the targets look like masks. Select the original and add the Morpher modifier to its stack.  Click on Load Multiple Targets and choose all the Jakes apart from the original. Click ‘Load’ and they will appear in the Morph Channel List  Figure 2.15 .  Figure 2.15 The Morph Channel List for Jake  Now  select  all  the  target  Jakes,  R-click  in  a  viewport  and  select  Hide Selection; we do not need them any more. Center your viewports on the original Jake and have a play with the sliders in the Channel List. Notice that you can combine the Morph targets to get some groovy expressions. Check that the eyeballs are not pushing through the mesh in any of the com- binations, if they are, pull them back inwards a bit. I have also made some rudimentary teeth out of a cylinder and linked it to Jake’s head along with the eyeballs. Otherwise when he smiles, you can see there is no back to his head! I have used noise maps in Multi-Sub-Object Materials to give Jake eyebrows, lips and a 5 o’clock shadow.  Now make a smooth band to go round his head  from the top viewport . Give it 40 sides as we need it to be metallic and smooth, and those extra vertices will come in useful. Assign a gold metallic material to the band and copy the tube by Shift-Moving it. Turn the new gold band into an Editable Mesh. Select a jagged half of it at vertex level and click on ‘Detach’ to cre- ate a new object. This will make the broken headband for Jake when his headache goes  Figure 2.16 .  Figure 2.16 Jake’s broker headband   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 67  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  67  I have also created a white box and used a number of Omnis to light it and not the rest of the scene, so it disappears into the background.  Hint: You can  include  or  exclude  objects  from  a  light’s  influence,  under  the  Light Parameters.  Jake is going to rise up from the box, get his headache when the ring descends and then shake it off.  Turn on the Auto Key  Animate Button  and animate the basic movement for the gold band and Jake’s position first. The gold band will need to be replaced by the broken Headband using the Visibility track in Step Mode. Do not forget to Ease Jake into his new Position and Hold him there with the Key Controllers. Now animate the Morph expressions. Remember that they  too  are  Bezier,  so  you  need  to  put  in  0  value  keys  to  control  the speed the expressions take hold. Any movement of the sliders creates a key, even if you scroll it up and back to 0.  Hint: You can use Key Controls for  Morpher  by  R-clicking  on  the  keys  in  the  Curve  Editor.  I  prefer  the more hands-on approach of the sliders in Morpher, so tend to use just those.   You will find that the gold band does not quite fit Jake’s head  unless you are very lucky  so tweak it around until it does. We do not care what it looks like from the back as that will not be seen. The only really important thing to remember is to align the original headband with the broken one when they swap over in Visibility. Animate the eyes by rotating them to anticipate the headache and return to normal at the end  Figure 2.17 .  Figure 2.17 Jake shakes off his tension headache  Have fun! This is not an exact science, all animation is subjective. Have you any idea how many different walk cycles there are? I added in a moment for Jake to say ‘Yesss’ with relief, as I thought it would be fun. When it looks good, render it as single frames, in PNG 24-bit format as before. We will be integrating them into a multiple page website later on.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 68  68  3D for the Web  Creating the ‘wow’ factor – sexy graphics Because 3D is so attractive, it is not unusual for a client to want a sexy graphic, or even a new logo created in 3D. These briefs are great fun as they are an opportunity to look at the product as a whole, and think side- ways to come up with something with that ‘wow’ factor. This is where play- ing with your software pays off. All those accidental buttons pressed and the ‘I wonder what this thing does?’ moments can be drawn on, and com- bined  with  your  marvelous  graphic  skills,  to  make  wonderful  things  and cover yourself in glory.  In the case of MacHead’s One Dose, I was much taken by the gold ‘O’ of ‘One’. The choice of gold for a color was obvious, as it represents a seal of approval. It also looks a bit like a target, and remembering Jake’s head- band, I thought it would be fun to combine all three elements. What I am after here is to represent the ‘feel’ of the product. I also decided to loop the graphic as clients love their logo, and a looped graphic is more adaptable.  Exercise: creating a sexy graphic  Creating a small, short looped graphic that will wow the client.  What to do  This is more a step-by-step analysis of the thought processes than a tutorial. Time to use your imagination.  The starting point for this animation was to recreate the gold rings that make up the ‘O’ of ‘One Dose’. They were created in 3D by Shift-Scaling a Torus seven times. Having made the rings  and knowing I wanted to loop them , but not knowing yet what I would create, I set Position, Rotation and Scale Keys at the front and end of the animation. Looking at the rings, I wanted to rotate them, so I started by pushing each alternate ring in a different direction. That looked  too  prissy  so  I  randomized  their  rotations,  just  so  it  looked  fairly chaotic and made a nice silhouette. I created a strong shadow plane as I thought the shadow might be fun and played with transparency and color.  Now I wanted something to generate the disturbance in the rings and chose a Particle Ray to shoot at the center of the rings like it was a target.  Because MacHead’s  One  Dose  is  renowned  for  its  pain  targeting  qualities.   For this, I used a SuperSpray and gave it a blue color to match the package   Figure 2.18 .   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 69  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  69  Figure 2.18 First attempt at graphic  But looking at this it was all a bit messy and unstreamlined. I decided to jet- tison the shadow as it made the graphic take an uncomfortable shape, lose the color and stick to gold to keep it streamlined, and look for something that might just indicate the tight headband of pain.  I grouped the rings and added a Spherify modifier. With just three keys it made each ring push out to a flat band shape and then return to a torus. It really  helped  the  easing  back  to  the  original  logo,  a  sort  of  equilibrium restored.  Remembering  the  effervescing  tablet,  and  mindful  of  potential sound I added a PCloud bubble fizz just as we did for the dissolving tablet.  The  finished  graphic  is  elegant  and  simple   Figure  2.19 .  The  reflective metallic rings and particles take advantage of the 3D environment, without shouting out ‘Hey lookee here’, and MacHead’s have a potential new logo. All in all the client is delighted – which is just as well, as in this case, the client is me.  Making a website in Flash We have created three elements for the website for our imaginary medi- cine, three styles of approach to our advertisement. The first version being a direct and straightforward advertisement, the second, a fun view, which could  be  interactive  and  the  third  being  a  more  symbolic  and  showy   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 70  70  3D for the Web  Figure 2.19 The finished graphic for MacHead’s One Dose soluble aspirin  metaphor. It is time to turn them into a Web-deliverable format, and we will use  Flash  to  collect  together  all  our  animated  frames.  You  could  convert each movie as a Flash movie file and place it on an HTML page, but this is not the most efficient method. The main reason is to do with streaming.  Streaming  Streaming is the idea of not loading a whole movie at once, before playing it, but starting to play it as soon as a small portion is downloaded, allowing the movie to play and download at the same time. If this works well then there are no pauses in the playback of the movie  this applies to digital video as well . So the user does not have to wait minutes before the anima- tion starts. Another idea for streaming in Flash is that you can load a whole section of a movie, e.g. one of our MacHead’s versions. This can be play- ing whilst the other parts of the movie load in the background. If the other versions are on different pages then they will already be loaded when we link to them. Normally when you link to an HTML page, you then have to wait for it to load. Streaming can remove the frustration out of Web brows- ing, giving a more professional look to your website.  So the best way to set up a heavily animated site would be to create it either mostly or entirely in Flash to ensure that it will play back in the most efficient manner.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 71  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  71  Creating a multi-page website At this stage in our chapter we have gone through various techniques to cre- ate some interesting graphics for our website. ‘MacHead’s One Dose’ is,  of course, a fictional product, but we want to create a website that has a corporate feel and has a reasonable amount of entertainment. We need to take advantage of the factor that distinguishes the Web from other media, like television and magazines. That factor is interactivity and in our previous chapter we made buttons, which we could use for web page navigation. The fact that they reacted to our mouse made them more exciting. Making a  simple  advert  more  exciting  and  interesting  should  help  enhance  any brand. How you do this is entirely up to you  and the sales and marketing department, if you have one! . For our MacHead’s product, we have cre- ated animations and it would be interesting if we could trigger them in our website. This makes our website more than just an animated advert, the interactivity should help visitors remember, and use, the product.  As we have several sections to our site we want to display them in the most interesting and efficient manner. We have already discussed streaming, but we do not necessarily want just a page-by-page website. It would be good if the brand identity was constantly on display. So we need to have a page set-up that has perhaps two halves, one with the brand title and the other showing our animations. We also need to include buttons in order to navi- gate between the interactive animations.  Issues affecting the display of websites  There has always been a major issue when designing web pages, and that is the platform that the web page is being displayed in, i.e. the browser, screen resolution and fonts. The most widely used browser by far is Microsoft Internet Explorer, but there are many browsers in existence. While they all do the same thing, they each have individual quirks. We have already talked about  Internet  Explorer  and  PNG  files,  which  display  fine  in  Netscape Navigator. Other issues they have are to do with the gaps between the HTML page and the browser edge  the margins . They also display frames differ- ently  frames are web pages within web pages . They each have different amounts of graphics on their interfaces. This is why most pages scroll, and text wraps around to accommodate different screen sizes. In traditional print design, this multitude of display formats is not an issue, generally a designer might design two or three layouts for different shapes of paper or advert space, and these would be stretch proportionately to fit the different sizes  of output.  Having a scrolling page is not ideal as you do not get to see the whole page at once and this might well affect the subtle messages of your advertising   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 72  72  3D for the Web  design, let alone design issues of balance and weight. Using Flash enables us to overcome most of these issues. We can stretch a Flash movie to fill a browser page, or keep it a size that will display on all screens.  The letterbox format  A popular aspect ratio to use for Flash pages is the letterbox format. This means  having  a  Flash  movie  that  is  similar  to  a  cinema  projection  or widescreen TV in shape. You will find that this will comfortably fit on nearly all users’ browsers. The only issue is whether you make your movie stretch to fit the browser window or not. Why is stretching an issue? Well, the extra issue which Flash brings up is the frame rate. Ideally we want our movies to play back at 25–30 fps  frames per second . This may not happen if the movie stretches by too large an amount as slower computers may not be able to display the movie at that speed. There is not a perfect answer to this issue, apart from testing your movie on many computers. The compromise is to decide on a minimum standard of computer setup that a majority of users will have and then make our movie fit that. Although most modern computers can display many different screen resolutions, the minimum that a majority of users will have will be 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels deep. Because the browser will take up a fair amount of space, this will leave an area of approximately 760  cid:4  350 pixels. So this is the space we have to put our movie in, the minimum. We could have it stretch if we want to, but this is a decision we would make when we publish our movie.  The MacHead’s website  The following is a general description of how the MacHead’s website was put together. As you may not have followed the previous tutorials exactly, what you want may be different. In fact I hope it is different as it is your cre- ativity that is important, aided by the skills you learn in this book. However, all  the  original  files  can  be  found  on  the  accompanying  CD,  for  you  to  analyze in greater detail.  For our Flash movie I went for a size of 720  cid:4  350 pixels, by setting the doc- ument size. This fitted into our possible sizes and had an aspect ratio that I found appealing. As my animation sequences have white backgrounds, I also set the document’s background color to white. I then incorporated the various graphics that were created for the package design for our product. This could have been done in various ways, e.g. completely creating the whole  page  in  Macromedia  Fireworks  or  in  Adobe  PhotoShop.  But  I decided to import each element separately as a PNG file, so that I could adjust my layout in Flash.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 73  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  73  I then used Guides, to help line up the elements. It is also helpful to have the Grid setting on as this also enables better alignment. Figure 2.20 shows the page layout, with some new text written on the right hand side. There was no need to import this as a graphic, as it was easy to type in the text directly. I set the paragraph style to be justified  straight-edged on both sides .  Figure 2.20 Layout for MacHead’s website first page  The last thing to add to my page was the four buttons used for navigation. The first button indicated the above page, the introduction or Home page as it is generally known. The second page linked to the Pill, Glass and Box animation  that  we  made.  The  third  and  fourth  buttons  are  for  our  ‘sexy graphic’ and our ‘Headache Jake’ animations.  Note  When talking about Flash pages, do not confuse them with HTML pages. The Flash document will contain many frames, each one could be called a page. For our website, we will only have one HTML page, which will hold the Flash movie, the .SWF file that contains all our Movie Clips  our animations .  For the buttons, I rendered the pill spinning on its axis. This animation was only 16 frames long and, as usual, was imported as PNG files. The best way to do this is to create a Movie Clip symbol  Insert  cid:2  New Symbol  and then import the animation frames. Using similar techniques to the latter part of Chapter 1, I made the animation into a rollover button. Instead of con- verting the symbol to a button, I kept it as a Movie Clip and added a script to it, as shown in Figure 2.21. The script shows that if the mouse rolls over the button then it will play the animation of the spinning pill. It also shows   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 74  74  3D for the Web  Figure 2.21 Script for a button on the MacHead’s website  that if the mouse is pressed, then the main movie  the _root  is told to navi- gate to frame 3.  The timeline for the Flash website looks fairly complicated and it is best to analyze the file yourself by opening it up. Figure 2.22 shows how many dif- ferent layers were used for each graphic. I labeled them, to make it easier to  work  out  what  is  what.  You  will  see  that  the  whole  movie  is  only  10 frames long. This is because the first three sections are each two frames long and the last section, four frames. The reason to have each section two frames  long  is  so  that  the  movie  can  continue  to  play,  whilst  appearing not to. For example, the script on frame 2 tells the movie to go back to frame 1, ‘gotoAndPlay 1 ’. It is sometimes helpful to keep a movie playing like this, so that you can use ‘Enterframe’ events, however, I will not go into that in a deep way at this stage. The last section is four frames because it has two parts to it, the ‘Before One Dose’ and the ‘After One Dose’ sections.  Note  One thing to remember about layers is that if you have two graphics on top of each other, then you will only be able to select the graphic on the top  layer.  To  get  around  this  it  is  necessary  to  hide  the  top  layer,  by pressing  the  little  eye  picture  whilst  having  the  layer  that  you  want  hidden, selected.  Although the movie is 10 frames long, I did not want all of my graphics to appear all the time. Only the graphics on the left hand side remain through- out the length of the movie, the others appear only when they are needed. For example, only the Pill and Glass animation is visible on frames 3 and 4. These Movie Clips for the middle two sections were also turned into Buttons, using ActionScript. Quite simply, the animations were triggered when the mouse rolls over them, by using a rollover script as in Figure 2.21. Each   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 75  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  75  Figure 2.22 Screenshot of the MacHead’s Flash timeline  Movie Symbol was also made to stop playing, using a ‘stop   ’ frame script on the first frame.  Top Tip When you import your animation frames into a Movie Clip symbol you will need to drag the symbol from the Library to the Stage. Normally this is a quick process, but when the symbol contains large amounts of graphics there is a significant pause to process this action. Be patient and your computer will catch up. This pause also happens whenever you extend the number of frames for that symbol, however moving the symbol around the Stage does not cause this problem.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 76  76  3D for the Web  The most complicated part of the MacHead’s site is the fourth section, as  it has two parts  Figure 2.23 . The Headache Jake Movie Clip starts auto- matically. Looking inside the Movie Clip for the animation you will see that there is a frame script which tells it to stop, this happens when the band is  Figure 2.23 Screenshot of the soothing section of the MacHead’s website  tightly around Jake’s head, on frame 35. This allows you to restart the anima- tion by rolling over the Pill button. You will see in Figure 2.24 that the frame 60 has been extended and that there is another layer on top, which carries on to frame 143. These are there to add pauses in the animation. It was unnecessary to include these pauses in the original rendering of the animation.  Figure 2.24 Screenshot of the MacHead’s Flash timeline  Back in the main movie, there is a script on frame 10 in the ‘After One Dose’ layer. This script checks to see what frame the Jake animation is on. If it is less than frame 105 then the main movie loops around frames 9 and 10, otherwise it will loop around frames 7 and 8. This way there is a clear difference between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ states.  Loading screens  Most of the Flash movie has now been described but there is one important issue that has not been dealt with. The graphical content of our website is   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 77  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  77  very high, as we are relying on the increasing usage of broadband Internet. We have already talked about streaming and how Flash utilizes it, but if  we can access all parts of our site at any time, what happens if the Movie Clips haven’t loaded yet? The answer is nothing; you will get a blank space where  the  graphic  is  waiting  to  appear.  So  we  need  something  to  tell  the user that the graphic is still downloading. This could be a ‘progress bar’, a graphical representation of the amount of data that has downloaded, or just a graphic informing you that the section is loading. In this case I chose the second option. When the movie jumps to frame 3 for the beginning  of the Soluble section, two spinning pills and the word ‘loading’ appears. These will load very quickly. The movie will not progress now until all of the ‘Pill and Glass’ Movie Clip has loaded, where upon the loading graphics  which have been converted to a Movie Clip  are told be disappear, using the ‘_visible’ Movie Clip command contained in the frame 4 script.  Finishing off a Flash website Sound  Although many people have the speakers on their computer switched off much of the time, particularly if they are at work, sound can add an extra level of immersion to your site. In the case of MacHead’s One Dose we could add plopping and fizzing sounds for the ‘Soluble’ section, a magical sound for the ‘Fast Acting’ section and have Jake sighing with relief for the ‘Soothing’ section.  You could have a whole soundtrack playing, but this would have to be good as it would add to the download time. Generally, music is reduced down to short  clips  that  loop.  However,  if  done  badly  then  music  could  be  more annoying than it is helpful to the promotion of your site. So you should use it wisely and appropriately, likewise with the incidental sounds.  Optimizing the Flash file  Now the Flash file has been described there are a few things to mention about  the  final  outputting  of  the  movie.  The  file  is  big,  approximately  2 megabytes, and it should be optimized further by cropping of graphics wherever we can, using layers and rendering only the parts of the anima- tions that change. This always takes a long time but is generally worth it in the end. You should check your imported frames and remove any repeats. As interest in your website depends on people having the patience to view it; you do not want to keep them waiting too long.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 78  78  3D for the Web  A  simple  way  to  reduce  the  file  size  is  in  the  publishing  options  in  Flash. Here you can set the JPEG compression that will be applied to your movie.  However,  if  you  compress  it  too  much  then  you  will  lose  image  quality, so you need to find a balance between file size and quality. JPEG compression  settings  of  around  70–80  usually  result  in  a  satisfactory  compromise.  When you preview a Flash file, by using the Control  cid:2  Test Movie menu option, you can select the View  cid:2  Bandwidth Profiler option to see how a file will load on various connection speeds. You can then see how long it would take to load on a frame-by-frame basis. Using this enables you to adjust your movie, perhaps by making your title screen load up in parts, or making sure that the complicated graphics start to load early. You want to try  and  make  the  loading  a  smooth  and  hopefully  invisible  experience. Ideally  you  will  give  your  audience  something  to  look  at  straight  away, something  other  than  a  loading  bar.  Then  you  will  have  made  your  site  successfully streamlined.  Instead of using animated images, the latest few versions of Flash allow you to import video files directly into it. These can be QuickTime Movies  *.mov  or Video for Windows files  *.avi  and many other video types. Flash has its own methods of re-compressing these files. Because of this, it is best not to have them too compressed to start with, so that Flash does not further reduce the quality. This is actually a simpler than using an image sequence, but older versions of Flash do not support this method.  Centering a Flash file  When you publish your movie, it will automatically create an HTML page for you. You could use this web page unaltered or you might want to amend it. The default HTML page will place the Flash movie in the top-left corner of the Web browser. But it would be nicer if it was in the middle of our screen. The best way to do this is to create a table, with three rows in. You can do this  in  Dreamweaver  with  a  blank  page.  If  you  set  the  tables  height  and width to be 100% then it will stretch to fill the screen. Make sure the border size is set to 0 so that the table edges do not show. Then import  your Flash file into the middle row and make it centered, by changing the properties.  In the case of MacHead’s website, I also changed the background color of the HTML page to match the dark blue used in the packaging design. This acts as a picture frame to our design, increasing its strength and prominence. Finally the page was uploaded to our web space. If you do the same then you should have a good-looking site with interactivity and some stunning graphics!  Figure 2.25 .   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 79  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  79  Figure 2.25 Screenshot of the MacHead’s finished website  Designing 3D websites We touched on designing interfaces at the beginning of the chapter. There have been many writers on the subject of interface design and Web interfaces and this book does not pretend to deal exhaustively with this subject. Here is a brief overview of some principles to keep in mind as we plan and build sites.  Signs and symbols  As we have established, buttons are a major aspect of websites. The sim- plest  buttons  are  just  text,  but  be  aware  that  not  everybody  on  the  net speaks your language, and they might still want to appreciate your grand creation. The best way around is to use a symbol or icon to represent ways to navigate your site. Commonly a picture of a house represents a site’s home page, and triangle symbols are used to indicate traveling forward and backward in the site. All text and pictures that have meaning are signs and it is important to realize what the symbolism in your website means, not just to you, but what it is likely to mean to others. If you use metaphors that are familiar to Web users then you can be fairly certain that they will be understood, otherwise there may not be any point using them at all. Some level of meaning will have to be transferred through the imagery you use, if you want your site to be truly international.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 80  80  3D for the Web  One way in which to make your links meaningful could be to contain them in a familiar device or object that could be understood. A common way of laying out a site is to give it tab dividers as in a paper folder. You could employ the idea of a remote control, with the idea of changing channels. People could accept this metaphor if it is related to your site correctly. So if I was designing a site selling pies, I might make a button shaped like a pie. If it was travel site; a stop go signal, and a website that deals with philo- sophical ideas might draw on thought bubbles, light bulbs or Rodin’s iconic sculpture, ‘The Thinker’, as inspiration.  Generally if you are using 3D for your buttons you will want to have an interesting character or themed objects that react to the mouse, along with the text to describe them.  Establishing the site’s message  The Internet is a communication medium, concerned with the transmission of information. How you present that information is your message and the style of delivery is the creative challenge that you have. The style of your site is going to affect how the user perceives you, your company or the company whose site you are creating, so it is important to get this right from the outset.  You need to establish who you want to visit your site and what kind of expe- rience you want them to have when they are there. You also need to decide if integrating 3D will enhance it. If the site’s purpose is to impart masses of text information, then 3D may not enhance it at all. However, if you are describing a product for sale then a 360 degree view of it might save you a thousand words of description and be much more useful. A major con- sideration  in  creating  an  impressive  site  would  be  to  attract  visitors  and  to make them aware of your brand. Attracting visitors must rank as one of the most important results from creating a website. The website you make needs to stand out from the crowd and the only way to do that is to keep pushing  the  boundaries  of  current  practice  and  invent  something  new. Remember, your website is always an advertisement for your skills and so taking  care  over  the  design  is  imperative  if  you  want  to  make  a  lasting impression.  Often the role of designer includes educating the client, showing them what is possible, and showcasing is an excellent way to do this. Making some impressive work at your own expense can be the best form of advertising, and be the difference between you getting the clients or your rivals. A 3D interactive makeover of an existing or new site can encourage people to visit, stick with and remember your site. Perhaps the inclusion of a computer game  can  lead  to  viral  marketing  via  the  powerful  medium  of  word-of- mouth. Maybe there is a new technique that you have invented that you   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 81  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  81  want to show off to prospective clients. In short, you must offer your visitor clarity, hooks and entertainment.  The interface  If  your  interface  resembles  familiar  objects  or  other  types  of  interfaces  then you can be reasonably sure that most people will know what to do. However you want to push the boundaries, so I suggest that you start sim- ple  and  ease  people  into  your  site.  Keep  the  style  of  buttons  the  same throughout your site. Navigation is one of the most important elements and people  need  to  be  guided  through  your  site.  If  a  button  reacts  to  being rolled over by the mouse pointer then people realize that it is going to do something. If a message pops up when you rollover it then they are likely to know exactly what it is going to do. If you can make your buttons and inter- face do interesting things then you are entertaining the user and keeping them on your site, which has got to be a good thing! You do not have to put everything on the home page though, you can bring elements in throughout the site, which stops the user becoming bored. You are rewarding them for exploring, luring them into other important areas of your website.  It is always a temptation when you have spent weeks or months working on a grand design to keep adding more and more elements. Whilst you are learning new software you can get carried away with what you just found out and be determined to include it. Always be careful about this, your web- site can become over complicated, with too much happening, or worse, be impossible to navigate. The attention span of the average Web user is very short, particularly if they cannot work out what to do. Frustration will be a major turn-off with an over-complicated site. When you design your inter- face, test it thoroughly on different people who know nothing about it. You must never do your own testing as you know too much about your work. Get feedback as to what people like and do not like and observe them using it, so you can see where they might struggle. You will be amazed how your guinea pigs cannot find something that you may have thought blindingly obvious!  Good planning is the key to creating an amusing or impressive site, com- bined with good design and technical skills. The companies interviewed in this book offer plenty of advice. These companies are practitioners at the top of their field and reading these interviews and checking out their web- sites should help you become a great Web designer.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 82  82  3D for the Web  Interview with Who’s We Studios http:  www.whoswestudios.com  Company profile  Who’s we is an elite design studio based in Frisco, Texas. The six designers feel passionate about pushing the boundaries in graphic design. They have won numerous awards and their work and website are at the cutting edge of 3D on the Web.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 83  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  83  I  first  came  across  them  when  two  different  students   one  from  3D Animation, one from Digital Arts  showed me their site, and in my turn, I have shown their site to many others.  The site is awesome; slick and funny, combining great lighting and sound with a neat interface. Clearly these guys have watched a lot of movies.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 84  84  3D for the Web  Interview  Can  you  describe  the  background  to  your  company,  its  aims,  ambitions,  client base? Our  company  was  founded  on  drive,  determination  and  pure  passion.  We  aim  to  get  bigger  every  year.  Our  ambitions  are  carrying  us  into  video production for the entertainment industry and possibly high-end 3D animation. We  like  to  get  almost  everyone  involved,  but  typically,  there  are  usually three main contributors to each project. We get everyone involved in the brainstorming sessions and then usually split the workload by availability.  Do you have separate 3D animators, Flash animators and programmers, or do the skills cross-over? Everyone here must be fluent in Flash, except for our 3D modelers animators. 3D applications are very time consuming to allow the typical 3D artist to also delve into Flash. As for programmers, we have one main programmer and two others who are not as fluent, but are strong Flashers, but for the most part, everyone has a double specialty.  Who handles the sound and what impact does sound bring to your sites? The sound is handled by two people here in our sound studio. Ninety percent of all of our audio is made from scratch. Whether you need custom sound effects, or a complete soundtrack in almost any genre, we can deliver. There are many tracks we have laid down on many of our projects, namely the Handheldgames.com  piece  which  we  ended  up  doing  a  few  mixes  for  the whole site.  General design and 3D What is your background? How did you get started in Web design? Most of us attended art schools. Before Who’s We, some of us worked for local  print  shops  and  other  design  companies  and  marketing  firms.  We have all been interested in the Web since the late 1990s when it really began to take off.  What do you think is the essence of good Web design? Can you give any  general tips? The essence of good Web design is having a strong foundation in design itself. I would strongly recommend taking a few design classes, as well as color theory classes to strengthen your fundamental knowledge in design.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 85  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  85  Without  these,  your  skills  may  never  progress.  You  must  have  complete  control of your colors, space, composition, aesthetics and usability.  Good-looking 3D has an immediate appeal. Do you see it as the way forward in Web design, or just another tool? After we leaked out into the design scene, we have noticed some design  studios making this movement on building 3D departments. Good 3D will always seem to captivate the masses. If used right, I believe we may begin to see it as the next level of design, the fusion between the two and making it a bit more mainstream.  What who are your inspirations for 3D? Our  inspirations  for  3D  are  everywhere.  It  seems  as  if  they  are  getting younger  and  younger.  Schools  all  over  the  world  are  producing  some  really good talent, but our biggest inspirations come from the big movie houses with big budgets to really push the envelope when they release their next film.  What is a typical timescale for making a website? A typical timescale for making a website can be anywhere from a week to a month, but the timescale for a website involving 3D can double that time, sometimes more. Because 3D was so new for us when we created our own site, the constant test rendering and bugs extended our production time to collectively, 5–6 months. Now, with the use of our render farm, we can com- plete 3D sites in a fraction of the time, but in the end, it all depends on the client and how ‘crazy’ they want to get.  How much of that time is pre-production and planning? Pre-production and planning can take anywhere from a couple of days to  a  few  months.  Take  our  Infinium  Labs  project,  it  took  several  months  to  plan  and  pre-produce  certain  elements  that  were  later  used  on  the  site. Sometimes, good design must not be rushed.A  What aspect of development would you say is the most time consuming? Conceptualization and creative are by far the most time consuming aspects of development. Since we are a creative studio and not a Web design com- pany,  our  clients  pay  us  to  come  up  with  fresh  ideas  and  angles.  This process can become very time consuming when a lot of money is at stake. Everything must be methodically structured and PERFECT.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 86  86  3D for the Web  Your past and future work The Who’s We website is very inventive and entertaining. How did you come up with the ideas for it? For the most part, all ideas came from a typical brainstorming session at the initialization stage of the project. We basically sit at a round table and pitch ideas back and forth, dispute a little, then come to a finalization where we are all happy with the results.  In your opinion what advantages does 3D technology have when creating a seamless interactive interface? Aesthetics. There is nothing like a nice, clean interface.  How often would you offer clients a 3D solution? We offer 3D solutions when we feel the client can benefit from them. Not  all of our work promotes 3D. Sometimes, good ol’ 2D work is more than enough. Some 3D can be very trendy, in which the client will specifically ask for a 3D piece similar to something he has already seen. It is all about giving the client what they want.  What awards have you won and do they make a difference? We have won several Favourite website Awards, a Flash Forward award, an Ultrashock Bombshock award … the list goes on, but at the end of the day, what makes a difference is having your passion and working in the field you really love.  Any special future projects using 3D? The next version of our site will definitely outdo our first one. It will be an innovative concept that you all will have to look out for. A  What software did you use to create the Who’s We website? We used two different 3D platforms and about 10 other design applica- tions. You just have to know what combinations of software to use to render the best results.  Does it vary from project to project? Yes … but for the most part, Photoshop, Flash and Soundforge typically end up at the top of the list.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 87  Chapter 2 – Interface design for 3D websites  87  How  much  programming action  scripting  do  you  use  in  creating  your  website? It all depends on the project. If a database is included in the project, that will increase your programming workload. Today, new software releases are making all of the programming much easier to manage your data.  Were there any specific problems you had to overcome? Yes … many.  We  had  to  learn  how  to  optimize  3D  and  learn  how  to  render it at its optimal settings for the Web. It is much more different than 3D for video production and especially for print. We had to overcome all of these.  Why have you chosen a highly rendered look as opposed to the more famil- iar vector shaped 3D? We feel that the raster-based renders can be more impressive since vector shaped 3D is limited to colors and overall impression. The only drawback to not rendering out in vector 3D is ending up with a much larger file size.  Which technology do you think will be the leader for 3D on the Web? I believe Flash will maintain its lead because of its overall capabilities in terms of interactivity.  Insights Do you have any advice for students of 3D Web design? Yes … 3D and Web are often not promoted together in schools. After all, you will never see a 3D student go to school just so they can learn 3D for the  Web.  It  is  just  not  going  to  happen.  If  you  truly  want  to  learn  Web design but still develop the 3D skill set, good luck. Non-vector 3D applica- tions take a very long time to learn. The best advice I can give is to spend most of your time in school developing your design skills. Having a strong foundation in design will help develop every other skill you wish to pursue in the future. Please … trust me on this! A  3D  has  almost  taken  over  the  games  industry,  do  you  think  it  will  become  predominant in Web design? I think it still has a long way to go, simply because funding a 3D department for a Web studio is very expensive and time consuming. Successful design studios typically must invest in a render farm which is basically a separate network of computers which sole purpose are to render out the images from the 3D applications where everything is modeled and animated.   Chap-02.qxd  8 12 04  15:01  Page 88  88  3D for the Web  Does current Web technology allow you to achieve all of your creative ideas, what improvements would you like to see from software? Faster  engines  and  bigger  pipelines  so  we  can  go  crazy  on  our  ideas. Bandwidth limitation is primarily our biggest stint in creativity.  Parts of your site have a lot of data to download. Do you see this as an issue with the rise of broadband? No … we love big files.  A And for everyone that says big files are bad design practice.

When we were in our 3D package  we  had  full  control  over  where  we  looked,  we  could  move  all around the space and view the object from any angle. After just a short while you were able to imagine that that space was part of reality. Working in three dimensions is the natural thing to do as we live in a 3D world, but our resulting output was flat and 2D. It showed an illusion of three dimen- sions that is convincing because, as humans, we are conditioned to seeing things that way.  We have introduced some interactivity to rendered animations, by using the mouse  to  trigger  their  playing.  In  theory  these  animations  could  be  very    Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 90  90  3D for the Web  complex, incorporating many camera angles, zooming in and around. The upside of this is that we can have an almost photorealistic high quality envi- ronment, but the downside is file size and flexibility. We are trying to make 3D for the Web and as everyone knows, waiting for huge files to download can be a real turn off. So what can we do about it? The answer is to use a real time 3D engine that will make use of the user’s computer graphics  CG  card to display your objects as you move about, changing your camera angle.  3D engines Working in 3D requires lots of programming to do all the mathematics of converting  3D  coordinates  into  2D  screen  coordinates.  There  are  many issues like working with Vector Math, calculating intersecting planes’ faces, displaying objects by priority of distance, etc. As designers, we do not want to be worrying about these things, which is where a 3D engine comes in. It is the software that converts your 3D ideas into a displayable form. In your 3D animation package the engine is displaying your creations on screen. The software calculates everything so that you can see your models in real time, just about instantly. This is what we want if we are going to be able to view our animations in an interactive way. Using this idea we can view a whole world from any angle, navigate our way around it and interact with objects inside of it. Great! But it is not perfect, as you might have realized. So far when you have been viewing your objects in your animation pack- age they appear at a much lower quality than after our final rendering, this is the trade-off. The amount of calculation involved in creating an instanta- neous 3D environment means that you cannot have the quality that you can in  pre-rendered  animation.  But  it  is  getting  better  all  the  time,  with  the improvement in PC graphics cards and game consoles.  To create objects and worlds for real time interactive 3D we have to be much more careful about how we create things in the first place. The pro- cessing required to render your previous animations as high quality images is similar to that of real time processing. The main problem is that your high quality rendering could take up to an hour per frame, but we need to get speeds of around 30 frames per second  fps , matching that of television  NTSC  being  30 fps  and  PAL  being  25 fps .  How  is  this  possible? The answer is by understanding what slows real time graphics down and using this knowledge to design objects and environments in the most efficient way possible, without having to compromise quality too much.  Maintaining a frame rate In my experience the most important thing about real time 3D is maintain- ing a high frame rate. It is this aspect that helps convince the viewer that the   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 91  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  91  scene they are watching is believable, more so than accuracy of rendering. A good example would be to take a car racing game. These have been around for the last 20 years, and the graphics involved has improved all the time. These games are always high in action and rely on giving the impres- sion of a fast moving world. To convince the human that what they are see- ing is a smooth motion and not a series of images, the frame rate needs to be high, that is greater than around 20 fps. Once a frame rate is lower than 20 fps then the motion seems jerky. Although traditional cell animation is often lower than this, you ignore this fact because it is the story and action that is governing your interest. With a racing game there is not going to be much story and the action is dictated by simulating a real driving experi- ence. Ideally a racing game will play at 50–60 fps. This is twice as much as is necessary for smooth animation but ideal as your television is display- ing graphics at twice 30 fps due to the way television pictures are made up in two fields, two half-resolution images per frame of video.  Creating content for real time 3D We have said already that you will not achieve the same quality in real time applications than you will with rendered animation, so let us discuss what you can and cannot do. In theory you can have the same quality, but this would require computers thousands of times faster than present day ones, so we need to simplify our scenes in order to attain a decent frame rate.  There are many factors to take into consideration when creating content for interactive 3D, the most important of which is the audience your piece is aimed for and, in particular, the computers they are using. There is a gen- eral  law  about  the  speed  of  computer  processors  called  Moore’s  law.  It actually relates to the number of transistors on microchips but is generally used to say that the speed and capacity of computers will double every  18 months. Roughly speaking, this has proved itself to be true over the last  25 years. But how does that help us? You need to decide at what level of computer power you are aiming your project. If it is aimed at the fastest of computers, with the best graphics cards, then you will deny most of the pop- ulation a chance to use it properly. However, if you make it for the lowest com- mon denominator then it may not be very impressive. You have to find a compromise between impressing and annoying.  Another issue that you need to be aware of is that you will not be creating 3D work that runs through a highly optimized engine, such as a dedicated games engine. If you had the power of the latest consoles then you could go for a lot of detail and complexity that simply is not available on most PCs. It is likely that you will be using another software package to create your work in, such as Macromedia Director  as used in this book , Discreet Plasma, Cult 3D or one of several others. There is always some speed trade-off   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 92  92  3D for the Web  with these programs in favor of a more user-friendly approach. Although this could be seen as a handicap, the benefits of ease-of-use outweigh the drawbacks. The skills that you are learning in this book are transferable  to  the  games industry. In effect, we are trying to bring the games industry  to the Web.  The more complex your scenes are then the more likely it is going to slow down the performance; so you need to adopt efficient practices when cre- ating  your  models  and  worlds.  Efficient  modeling  can  be  done  in  many ways and the following section describes what aspects slow your graphics down and what can be done to maintain as much quality as possible, with- out compromising the frame rate. Exactly what your project is will affect where you need to make the most efficiency saving, but generally a com- bination of the following concepts is going to be usual.  Number of objects  In a real time 3D scene, the positions, lighting and materials of objects are actually calculated one a time. When they are all worked out, the computer displays them. This happens so quickly that the impression is given that it happens simultaneously, in an instant. However, every object in your scene slows your computer down by a fraction of a second. This may not be obvi- ously  until  you  have  hundreds  of  objects  but  object  count  is  one  of  the biggest factors in performance of real time graphics.  If you want to test this speed issue out then create a few hundred cubes in your animation program. You can create a few, then select them and clone that group, etc. in order to achieve this more quickly. When you try and rotate your views you will see how much slower things are, compared to when you had just one cube on screen. You might find that your program changes the objects to wireframe boxes when you rotate the view, which is its way of maintaining a frame rate. Naturally, we do not want this to hap- pen  if  we  are  creating  an  application  or  game.  The  object  count  issue becomes more important when combined with the next issue, polygon count.  Polygon count and face count  All CG cards create objects by connecting points together, creating faces. The simplest shape is a triangle, known as a face. Triangles can be tiled together to make any other shape. So when graphics are displayed in real time  e.g. in a computer game, or in the viewport of your 3D modeling pro- gram , the computer is actually displaying hundreds of triangles. It will then use techniques to smooth the view of these triangles, so your objects look less computerized.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 93  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  93  As was mentioned in Chapter 1 of this book, in computer modeling pro- grams a polygon is two triangle faces placed together, to form a square. Because the square is a flat shape, this is often confused with a face, and why polygon count and face count are often used interchangeably. In terms of real time 3D graphics, it is the triangle count which is important, as that is what the graphics card actually deals with.  Simple shapes, like cubes, may only have a few polygons. In real life we would consider a cube to have six sides, but in CG terms, it is made out of 12 triangle faces. However, there is nothing to stop each flat side of the cube being made out of a mesh with hundreds of triangles, arranged in a grid. This may not appear to be an issue, but more complicated CG shapes, like human figures can have thousands of triangles. Each triangle that is  visible on screen needs to be displayed, so if you have hundreds of humans running about, that will dramatically slow things down. This is particularly so for animated objects, like characters as there is more to calculate, like the new positions of each triangle on the object.  Whole  scenes  can  consist  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  polygons,  if  you have created it for a pre-rendered animation. But for real time graphics we need to optimize the detail of your objects, wherever possible in order to reduce the polygon count.  There is another aspect to face count which is possibly confusing. Manufacturers of graphics cards will talk about being able to display millions of faces per second and performing thousands of trillions of calculations per second. That sounds a lot, but 3D graphics are exceedingly processor intensive. The latest 3D cards claim to be able to draw around 50 million triangles per second.  But,  if  you  wanted  a  50 fps  frame  rate,  then  this  is  a  million  triangles per frame, or 500,000 polygons per frame. Excellent, you might think, but that is the optimal rate, for the latest graphics cards, which most people will not have.  Other factors affect the speed of your real time application, other calcula- tions that you might be performing in your game or application. A computer game will have many different processes occurring simultaneously, so you always need to be trying to optimize every process. The greater the number of other processes going on then the more you will need to optimize the graphics. This book uses the Shockwave 3D engine, which is part of the Macromedia Director application. Versatile as it is, it is not the fastest 3D engine in the world, as it is not specialized just for games. Because of this I recommend aiming for a total of 25,000 polygons at most. This might even have to be lower, if there is a lot of movement in your scene. An animated object will take longer to display than a still one. In 3ds max you can check the number of triangles in your scene by going to the File  cid:2  Summary Info menu option.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 94  94  3D for the Web  Texture size  There are two types of memory in your computer, the main system memory and  the  graphics  memory.  Generally  speaking,  these  are  independent  of each other, but some PC’s use the system memory for graphics  known as shared  memory .  The  graphics  memory  is  used  for  displaying  the  whole screen, displaying any 3D content, using textures in 3D objects and the qual- ity  of  the  textures.  Typical  graphics  cards  have  between  32  and  128 megabytes of memory. Displaying the screen will take up more memory at higher resolutions and can take up to around 10 megabytes. Textures at full color will take any amount from 12 kilobytes for a 64  cid:3  64 pixel texture to 768 kilobytes for a 512  cid:3  512 pixel texture and a 1024  cid:3  1024 pixel tex- ture will take 3 megabytes of memory. If you include an alpha channel in your texture then it will add another 33% to the file size. All these numbers might seem a little baffling and off-putting, but it is important to keep track of it as you design your scene. So what happens when you run out of graphics memory in your scene? Your application will run very slowly as it tries to use your main system memory as graphics memory, which is a much more inef- ficient process. So, as you can see, if you want your piece to work well on a 32  megabytes  graphics  card  then  you  cannot  have  many  large  textures. Another issue with this is that the graphics card will grab memory depending on the power of two that the dimensions of the texture fit into  Figure 3.1 . This means that, if your texture measured 304  cid:3  413 pixels, it will take up as much memory as a 512  cid:3  512 texture, so you might as well make it that size, or reduce it down to 256  cid:3  256, to be more efficient.  Working all these figures out can seem very laborious, but it is best to keep track of these as you go along. The best thing to do is to test your product on a computer that you know is not top of the range. If it works on that then you can be fairly certain it will work on most computers.  It is always a good idea to use textures that tile where ever you can. An example of this would be brickwork. Although in reality no two bricks are exactly the same, they are approximately, so you can select a square from a photograph of bricks and make them tile. This means you could have a very small texture, e.g. 64  cid:3  64 and repeat it a hundred times to have a highly detailed large brick wall. The point to remember here is that it is the size of the individual texture that uses up memory, and not the amount of area it covers.  Animating textures  You might have a situation where you want a texture to be animated, e.g. a television set. This can be done in a couple of ways, either by having a sequence of images or using a video file. Either way the texture has to be   Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  95  Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 95  64  cid:3  64   128  cid:3  128  256  cid:3  256  512 cid:3 512  Figure 3.1 A demonstration of possible texture sizes  1024  cid:3  1024  updated on every frame, which for larger textures can be a slow process. There is no easy way to avoid this apart from using smaller textures, which will update much quicker.  Another reason why you might want to animate a texture is to show flowing water. Moving the texture across the model, by changing the texture coor- dinates, can do this. This technique has practically no effect on the frame speed and so can be used. It is also possible to have multiple layers of  texture flowing in different directions.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 96  96  3D for the Web  An important point to raise here is that in both of these types of texture  animation, you have to do it in Director, with Lingo programming. It does not take a lot of code, just a few lines, but you cannot export this type of  animation using the Shockwave W3D exporter.  Shadows  Shadows are great for that added touch of realism and in real life we take them for granted. Without them objects seem to float on top of the ground. The trouble with shadows is that they can be very complicated to achieve. True shadows are calculated by Raytracing, which is the idea of following a line from a light source to the object and then creating an outline on the ground. This is the most accurate form of shadow creation, but also by far the slowest.  Another much simpler technique is to place a soft edged shape below the character or object, if it is moving around the scene. This idea has long been used by computer games and works well enough from a convincing point of view. The black soft edged shape can be placed on a plane, using alpha transparency to fade it into the ground below, this plane is then set to follow the character as it moves around the ground. See Chapter 8 for an explanation of this.  A third method is particularly useful for room environments, where none of the objects is going to move. The idea is that you set your scene up in your 3D software and then render it with all the shadows and illumination that you want. The trick is to render it from the top view down and then from the four side views of your room. These rendered images become your textures, each with various shadows falling upon them. This technique works very well on the photorealistic front, but does mean that you can end up with large textures, which as we have already discussed, can be a problem. It means that you have to keep an eye on the texture size. You could load up all the textures just for that room and remove them when you leave it. This way you could create a large house, with lots of textures. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 of this book.  There are other techniques for real time shadows, that computer game com- panies use. These make use of the graphics card’s ability to cast shadows. The Shockwave 3D engine, although being hugely popular, does not cur- rently support true shadows, and so advanced tricks are required to create accurate  shadows.  These  are  unfortunately  processor  intensive,  which  leads to the frame rate slowing down. This is why these second and third techniques are often used.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 97  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  97  Reflections  This is quite a special case, as you often will not need reflections in your scenes.  However,  if  you  do  have  a  pane  of  glass,  a  garden  pond  or  a metallic object, you will probably want to have reflections in order to add that touch of realism. There are several ways to do this.  As with shadows, the best way is to use Raytracing, but this time tracing a path from the camera to the object and reflecting off until it meets another object. This needs to be done for every pixel on the screen that has a reflec- tion material on it. This is even more time consuming than shadow Raytracing, and is pretty much impossible to do in real time, particularly because the Shockwave 3D engine does not support it.  The simplest, and effective solution, is to use a reflection map, this is a still picture, which might be a rendered view taken from the object. A reflection map moves around the object as your view of it changes. It gives the illusion of a reflection as you can often see the sky and surroundings in the object. This works best for complicated objects, such as an android, but does not work very well for flat planes as the result can be confusing. Its main advan- tage is that it is a fast solution.  The next option is probably the best quality, but is still fairly slow. It involves dynamically taking snapshots from a camera point, behind the mirror or reflected surface, every frame. The image is projected onto the reflecting object. The problem here is that this technique uses the computer processor as opposed to the graphics processor. As your computer processor is prob- ably  doing  many  other  things,  your  frame  rate  could  be  dramatically reduced. In short you are unlikely to use this technique apart from for very small reflected surfaces.  Deforming objects  Deforming objects are any objects that change shape, Morph or are ani- mated with stretchy skin. This could be a running character, where you have already worked out the walk cycle in your 3D package and exported the animation.  If  the  object  has  a  large  number  of  triangle  faces  then  the amount of time it takes to calculate each new face position is increased. Characters typically have to be as low in triangle count as possible in order to attain a smooth animation. A character with more than 1000 faces may appear to be low in detail, but is already getting large for the purposes  of  Shockwave  3D  and  you  should  try  and  remove  as  many  unnec- essary faces whilst still retaining the look of your character. You could have a higher face count, if there is not much else in your application. But if you   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 98  98  3D for the Web  have  many  characters  or  a  complicated  game,  you  will  always  have  to compromise here.  The trick to creating detail in your objects is to use bitmap images to give the appearance of 3D detail. For example, heads of people should be mainly made up out of these bitmap textures as opposed to thousands of triangle faces for details like ears and eyes. Of course, if sticky out ears are essential to your character then you will put them in. The trick is to reduce polygon count in areas that do not deform in your character, and other flat areas.  Reducing polygon count is discussed later in this chapter, where 3ds max’s Optimize modifier is used. Chapter 5 takes you through low-polygon char- acter modeling, meaning modeling deliberately to keep the triangle count low. It is always most important to optimize the face count of objects that change shape.  When you are preparing content for the Shockwave Exporter there are some restrictions that you need to be aware of. You cannot do standard Morphing  changing  the  form  of  an  object  from  one  state  to  another   or  even  Sub- Object deforming  like the pressing down of the turtle’s back that was cov- ered in Chapter 1 . You have to export these objects in each of their different states and then you would use program Lingo code to do the Morphing. Lingo is the programming language of the Macromedia Director application.  The Metamorphosis kinetic sculpture seen in Figure 3.2 was created entirely in  Director,  by  programming  and  is  an  example  of  a  Morphing  object.   Figure 3.2 Six screenshots of ‘Metamorphosis’, an interactive morphing sculpture, by Anthony Head   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 99  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  99  In Director you can create primitive objects, such as cubes, cylinders and spheres. The Metamorphosis sculptures, involve the deformation of a sphere into two states. The deformed sphere then pulsates between the two states in  a  smooth  manner,  depending  upon  programmed  properties,  such  as  elasticity and friction. The project actually involves six sculptures, each with different properties.  The  kind  of  Morphing  objects  involved  in  the  Metamorphosis  projects  cannot be exported from 3ds max to Director. You would simply get the original  shape,  with  no  animation.  However,  it  is  possible  to  achieve  a Morphing animation using bones, giving your objects an internal skeleton structure. 3ds max has two types of system for this, one is called ‘bones’ and the other is Character Studio Biped. Both can be used for character animation, where your skeletons are ‘skinned’ by the character object. The information that gets exported is the bone animation as well as the mesh. Shockwave dynamically calculates the deforming of the mesh as the char- acter moves around the scene. This means that it is possible to merge bone animations  together,  e.g.  changing  from  a  running  motion  to  a  jumping motion, as the information required for movement is just the bones and the object vertices relation to those bones, that is how strongly their position  is affected by the bone movement. This concept forms several chapters of this book.  Exporting to Shockwave We have talked now about how to prepare your 3D models and objects  in order to get them into a 3D engine program, in our case Macromedia Director. You will be exporting a file with an extension .w3D and this file will be imported into Director. From Director we will export a Shockwave file   with  the  .DCR  extension   for  use  on  the  Internet.  The  W3D  file  you export from your 3D program will not work as it is, it has got to be edited and re-exported in Director.  We have covered a lot of detail that might not seem relevant at this stage, after all we have not made any interactive 3D environments as yet. Even if you only skimmed through it, you can use the information as a reference as you continue. The main thing we have not covered so far is what kind of materials we can successfully export to Shockwave, because unfortunately it is not all of them.  Most of the time when you are creating a model you will probably use a bitmap texture to cover it. This method gives you great flexibility, as you can create your own from photographs or scans. Bitmap textures are what the Shockwave engine understands and uses. However, many of the material maps  in  3ds  max  are  not  bitmap  based,  they  use  procedural  textures.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 100  100  3D for the Web  Procedural textures are created using algorithms that create repeating pat- terns. As you need to keep textures fairly small, you need to be able to use tiling patterns wherever you can. There are two types of procedural maps: 2D  and  3D.  The  3D  maps  are  more  powerful  but  are  not  supported  by Director, so you can only use the 2D ones, such as checker and swirl. The table below shows some of the 3ds max maps that are compatible with Director. All the maps should be applied as Diffuse maps to appear normally on the model that you have created.  Map name  Extra options  Notes  Bitmap  Noise  Checker Gradient Gradient ramp  Noise, soften Noise Noise, gradient types  four  corners, box, diagonal, lighting, linear, mapped, normal, pong,  radial, spiral, sweep, tartan  Twist, contrast, intensity  Can  be  most  types  of  imported  image, including alpha transparent bitmaps Checker can be a mix of two other maps A way to blend up to three different map Only mixes colors, not other maps  Mixes only color  Swirl  Note  There  is  an  issue  with  transparency  in  Director  which  means  that objects that have semi-transparent materials do not intersect correctly. This is due to the Z-buffer, which is the aspect of 3D rendering, which calculates how near and far objects are. Most of the materials above  apart from bitmap  end up including a level of transparency. To get round this deselect materials when using the W3D exporter.  Putting the knowledge into practice –  creating a sound toy To take us through creating some 3D that will be interactive and real time, it will help to have a practical example to deal with. We want to make something that is interesting and appealing to the user and, for the sake of demonstration, an artifact that will show something of what is possible with- out being too technically difficult at this stage. Obviously you want to make impressive websites, but there is no replacement for creativity, you need  to draw on as many influences as you can and extract them into your own ideas. The following tutorial is very loosely based from the point of view of   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 101  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  101  3D modeling as I hope that everyone who follows it will come up with his or her own version of its topic, a sound toy.  Sound toys are a type of Digital Art and come in many shapes and forms, but essentially refer to any interactive computer generated artifact that deals with sound and more often than not, vision. The basic idea behind a sound toy is that they encourage the participant to play, and that is a good thing for any website. Fun things give your website traffic, which is surely the aim of any- one wanting a website, to get people to visit and keep visiting. Creating a toy or a game is a popular way to attract people to your website. We will cover concepts involved in game creation later in the book, but first, we now will make a wobbly, stretchy, elastic sound toy that you control with the keyboard.  Exercise: making the sound toy There are two phases to this exercise, the first is creating some 3D models and  placing  them  in  an  environment  and  the  second  will  be  applying motions  to  the  objects  in  Macromedia  Director.  You  already  have  some modeling knowledge and this section is a chance for you to explore your 3D package without having to worry about accuracy of modeling. The sec- ond stage will be your introduction to Director, which has many powerful features that usually rely on knowledge of its programming language Lingo. To make life easier at this stage, the programming has been done for you and you will be able to select actions and sounds for your objects, whilst familiarizing yourself with the Director interface. Finally you will be able to publish your movie as a Shockwave file for use on the Web. Figure 3.3 shows the sound toy included on this CD with this book.  The modeling  It does not matter much which methods you use to create your objects as they are going to end up as fixed meshes. You will not be doing any animation in your 3D program. The objects you create can be as complicated as you like, but you have to be aware of face count, about which we have just talked.  I  recommend  going  for  an  abstract  approach  as  the  objects  you  create will move, but not in an animal-like way, but vibrate and distort. They will  have  properties  of  elasticity  and  friction,  combined  with  different actions like spin and stretch.  You might want to create standard musical instruments, but this is the world of your imagination that we are dealing in so your objects can be anything. You can use this chance to explore some of your 3D packages options for model creation, exploring various modifiers or going crazy with polygonal modeling.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 102  102  3D for the Web  Figure 3.3 A simple example of the kind of sound toy that you could create  Polygonal modeling  You have already done this in Chapter 1 when you created the turtle and Chapter 2 when you created the head character. By creating a box and converting  it  to  an  editable  mesh,  you  can  Extrude  and  Bevel  polygons  make sure you are in Polygon Sub-Object mode . You can either work to  a design from paper or just Extrude and Bevel away at your will. I have  created an abstract shape that you can see in Figure 3.4 and then applied the Mesh Smooth modifier to make it aesthetically more pleasing.  Mesh Smooth  Using the Mesh Smooth option often improves the look of your creations, making them more organic in shape. Any object that has unwanted sharp edges can be smoothed off with this modifier. The issue with Mesh Smooth is the resulting face count, so do not increase the iterations too much.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 103  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  103  Polygonal Model 90 Faces  Mesh Smoothed 736 Faces  Optimized 486 Faces  Figure 3.4 A polygonal model with Mesh Smoothing and Optimization  Optimize  In 3ds max you can use the Optimize modifier to reduce your face count, by adjusting the Face Thresh parameter. This can sometimes lead to unde- sirable  outcomes  in  your  models  though,  particularly  if  they  are  compli- cated,  so  use  it  with  caution  and  judge  for  yourself  if  you  have  tried  to reduce the face count too far. Figure 3.4 also shows the result of optimizing the shape, there is a significant reduction in face count with only a slight deterioration in the quality of the model. Note that the reduction is more  significant on flatter areas.  Another issue with the Optimize modifier is when creating objects which use the Multi-Sub-Object Material. You will use this later in the book to map textures onto a character. The problem with optimize is that it reduces the face count mathematically and not by aesthetics. This means that faces that you might want to stay unchanged can be removed, making it difficult to place the textures where you want them. It can also cause problems if you use it on an animated character as it can stop the mesh bending in the correct places. However, if you are only simply applying a material over the whole object and is not animated then this may not be an issue for you.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 104  104  3D for the Web  Note  For our sound toy we will only be having a few objects in the scene, and hence we can get away with relatively large face counts for each object. If we were making a computer game with possibly hundreds of objects then we would be a lot more thorough in reducing the count, with careful modeling.  Other modifiers  Your 3D package probably has many ways in which you can create and distort objects. 3ds max has modifiers, such as melt, stretch, spherify, ripple, relax, noise, taper and twist. In Figure 3.3 the left hand shape was created by melting a cylinder, which had many height sections, and twisting it. The six upper floating shapes were just created from spheres that were stretched and tapered. The bottom right hand shape is a Tube primitive that has been Mesh Smoothed and the middle shape is a polygonal model.  Mapping  On the shapes in my scene I have used a number of maps taken from the list in Figure 3.2. To make my objects more interesting, I have used a reflec- tion map. The map should be one that matches the environment, in my case a checkered box room. So I used the same map on these shapes as the room. The effect of this is best when you see it in real time 3D, when you export your creation as a W3D file. The idea behind the reflection map is that it always faces the camera, and then moves around the object. This gives the illusion of a reflective surface. I set the reflection amount down  to 10% as I wanted it to mix with the Diffuse map that I had selected. As  I mentioned earlier, reflection mapping works best on curved shapes.  Exporting to W3D  When you are happy that you have created an interesting setup for your sound toy, with some interesting shapes and objects, it will be time to export them. If you have not done so already, make sure that all your objects are named in a way that makes sense to you. You can only export the scene if you have the Shockwave Exporter installed on your computer. This is a gen- erally free plug-in that can be found on your 3D application’s website. The exporter window is different for each 3D application but Figure 3.5 shows the 3ds max version. You will see the kind of features that you can export.  You export by going to the File-Export menu and selecting Shockwave 3D Scene  Export   *.w3D .  The  Export  window  will  appear  after  you  have  chosen a file name for your scene. There are several options on the window that will be already selected for you.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 105  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  105  Figure 3.5 The Shockwave Exporter panel in 3ds max  Preview options  This option is very handy as it will show you how your scene will look after you  have  exported  it.  You  can  rotate  around  the  scene  by  holding  the mouse button down and dragging.  Compression settings  These options allow you to reduce the size of the exported file. Experimenting with these can be very useful if your scene is large. You want your file to be   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 106  106  3D for the Web  as small as possible so that end users can download it quickly. Be wary of lowering these numbers too much as they could have unwanted side effects on your scene. Compression settings lower than 50% are likely to have a fairly dramatic effect on the quality.  Texture size limits  This is handy to set if you have used bitmaps where you have not edited their size already. It is always best to keep textures at a size that is a power of 2 as mentioned earlier, but these options will resize them. Be aware that if you have a large bitmap, that reducing the size will reduce the quality, but that is part of the compromising you have to make when creating real time content.  Shockwave resources to export  Generally you can keep all of these options checked. If there is no anima- tion  in  your  scene,  then  none  will  be  exported.  There  is  an  issue  with Shockwave that makes objects not intersect properly if there is transparency in  them.  The  maps  other  than  bitmap,  e.g.  swirl,  etc.,  do  contain  trans- parency. If you use these maps then uncheck the material resources box. This will not make an obvious difference to your file, but means you will not be able to have semi-transparent objects if they intersect with other objects.  Animation options  In our sound toy, we are not going to do any animation in your 3D package  although there is nothing stopping you experimenting with it . Animation files are generally quite small and so I recommend you keep Sampling to 1 which means the same number of keyframes as you put in. Make sure that the range covers the full length of your animation if you have any.  Additional options  You might as well keep these objects checked as they can give you infor- mation about your export. You will probably always get messages indicat- ing that things are wrong, e.g. you will be warned that you have used a non-Blinn shader. However, if it does not look wrong, it is not and you will find that this error appears if you have the Blinn shader selected in your materials.  Now you have set the options it is time to make our scene interactive, using Macromedia Director.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 107  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  107  Introduction to Macromedia Director Director is a multimedia production program and our chosen platform to create our  interactive  sound  toy.  Director  is  responsible  for  creating  Shockwave movies that you find on the Web, often computer games. There is sometimes confusion between Director Shockwave movies and Flash movies. These two programs are similar in what they do and are made by the same company. Traditionally,  Director  was  aimed  at  creating  CD-ROM  applications,  e.g. educational software with video content and Flash aimed at the Web ani- mation market. There are, in essence, two main differences between these two programs. Flash has superior vector graphic capabilities and Director has superior 3D capabilities. Director is better at incorporating other media, such as various video formats and QuickTime  including QuickTime VR . It is also possible to embed a Flash file into Director, but not vice versa. We are going to use Director for its 3D capabilities and this is best done with  the  use  of  some  programming.  Where  Flash  uses  a  programming  language called ActionScript, Director has its own language called Lingo. As this is just an introduction, I have done all the programming for you, but if you are already familiar with Lingo then you will be able to look at and adapt the Lingo scripts for your own uses. Above all this whole exercise has been designed to be flexible and provide a wide variety of results.  The important parts of the  Director interface There is a lot to Director and many ways to use it. As we are only going to be delving into the 3D aspect of this program, we will skip somewhat the detail about all the options and concentrate on the relevant aspects. Figure 3.6 is an enlarged view of the important control buttons you will need to be familiar with in order to navigate easily through the different windows of the application.  Figure 3.6 A section from Director’s top tool bar  The first section is the control panel, with the Rewind, Stop and Play options. It is often important to rewind a movie before you play it and so it is a good   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 108  108  3D for the Web  habit to always do this. The next contains the buttons for the Stage window, the  Cast  window,  the  Score  window,  Properties  Inspector  and  Library palette.  The Stage  As  the  name  suggests,  this  is  the  window  where  the  action  takes  place. Macromedia Director, for the most part, uses Theater terminology as a way to make its components easier to understand for users. What you see in this window is what the end users will see in the Shockwave movie that you will create from this exercise  Figure 3.7 .  Figure 3.7 The Stage window  The Cast  The Cast is where all the objects reside that you are using, e.g. graphics, sounds  and  Lingo  scripts   Figure  3.8 .  This  is  similar  to  the  Library  in Macromedia Flash. There are many types of media that can be imported into Director, but we shall deal with just a few, the Shockwave 3D  .w3D  file, some sound files  .MP3’s or .WAVs  and also some Lingo scripts  Director’s programming language  which will be explained later in this chapter.  Certain objects  like graphics  can be dragged on to the stage, creating an instance of that object. When a graphic is on the Stage it is known as a Sprite. Sprites can be controlled through Lingo or by using keyframes in the Score. In our case we will Drag the W3D Cast Member on to the stage, but we will not be moving it about.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 109  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  109  Figure 3.8 The Cast window  The Score  The Score is similar to Flash’s timeline. It shows two counters, the one going across is the Frame number and the one counting downwards is the Sprite Channel number  Figure 3.9 . You could create a Sprite and it would appear  Figure 3.9 The Score window   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 110  110  3D for the Web  in Sprite Channel 1 on frame 1. You could then make it last until frame 20, and move it, creating a keyframe. This would be animating in a similar way to Flash and 3ds max. However, for 3D work, we will not use Director this way, our 3D sprite will stay in frame 1 and will not move about the Stage.  It is within the 3D sprite that all the action will take place, using Lingo.  The Property Inspector  The Property Inspector displays important information on settings for your Director project  Figure 3.10 . If you click on the Stage and then select the   Figure 3.10 The Property Inspector, showing the movie information  Property Inspector you are able to view the Movie properties. It is here that you can set the movie size, which is the pixel size of the Stage. Bear in mind that this has to fit on most people’s Web browsers. However, it is possible to set up your movie to stretch to fit the area of the Web browser window, as it is with Flash.  For our purposes the other important feature in the Property Inspector is the Preferred Renderer option. The graphics card inside your computer contains hardware  to  calculate  the  display  of  your  3D  content  and  the  Preferred Renderer option will choose from a few different methods that it can do this, namely DirectX, OpenGL and Software. DirectX and OpenGL are graphics standards that programmers use to instruct the graphics card on how to cre- ate the 3D display. In the case of Director it is the programming language   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 111  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  111  Lingo that we use and this is converted to DirectX or OpenGL code auto- matically. The other option of Software is to let the computer’s processor cal- culate the 3D display. This is always slower than allowing a graphics card to do the job, as the central processing unit  CPU  is not dedicated to graph- ics calculations. Generally selecting Auto will allow the user’s computer to decide whether to use DirectX or OpenGL. In simplistic terms, there is not a lot of difference between the two, but try to avoid selecting Software mode as it is by far the slowest method.  Note  If your 3D scene contains many complicated objects and large textures then you could reach the limit of the graphics card memory  which might be 32 or 128 megabytes . If this is exceeded Director might automati- cally switch into Software mode and be very slow. This is why you need to consider texture size when creating your scene in your 3D package.  The Behavior Inspector  The little picture of a gear cog displays the Behavior Inspector. This contains one of the methods you can use to add scripts to your 3D world to control objects within it  Figure 3.11 . You can use Lingo scripting to change the position of objects, alter the textures that are mapped on to them, move the camera position, create new objects from scratch as well as more compli- cated  functions.  New  objects  have  to  be  primitive  shapes,  e.g.  cubes,  Figure 3.11 The Behavior Inspector showing how to select a behavior or create a new one   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 112  112  3D for the Web  spheres and cylinders which is why we have created our objects in a 3D package. It is a lot easier to create interesting objects this way and get away from the basic shapes. A behavior is a script that contains commands and calculations to control objects. You would normally have to type this in by hand and learn many commands. For the tutorial described soon and at this early stage in our use of Director we have adopted a simpler method for you to use, where you only have to apply the settings of an already written script.  Making our sound toy move This tutorial will allow you to animate your static scene, based on physical properties,  such  as  elasticity  and  friction.  Changing  these  properties  on each object will make it move in a different manner. The movement will be triggered by keystrokes. As well as animating your scene, we will import sounds which can be used to correspond to your objects. The process of completing  this  tutorial  will  help  you  familiarize  yourself  with  Director  in addition to the creation of your own unique piece of work. First of all load up the SoundToyNew director file from the CD. This is essen- tially a blank file but it contains the scripts that we need to use. If you look at the Cast window you will see them listed in cast positions 2, 3 and 4  Figure 3.12 . You will see that each script Cast Member contains a title, an icon and a snippet of the actual code that it contains. The second two scripts   Figure 3.12 The Cast window showing a Movie script and two Behavior scripts  contain the cog icon that we are now familiar with. They are behaviors and will only work when they are applied to the Score. The first script, called Prepare Movie, has a different icon and is not a Score Behavior script, it is a Movie Behavior script. Movie scripts are generally used to create actions   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 113  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  113  that can be accessed by any other script, or for setting up conditions at the beginning of the movie. In our case it finds out which member is the 3D Shockwave one  which we have yet to import  and then carries out some actions on that Cast Member  to fix the transparency issue if you have used procedural textures in your scene .  Importing the Shockwave 3D .w3D file  At the moment our movie will not work, if you tried to run it  by pressing the Play button  it will error. This is because the Prepare Movie script is trying  to apply commands to an object that does not exist, that is, the 3D Shock- wave member. So you need to import it. There are a couple of ways to  do this, one is to select the space where Cast Member 1 would be  in the Cast window . Right click and select import from the menu. Then find your .w3d file that you exported and press import. It will now be in Cast Member 1  and  you  will  see  a  thumbnail  image  of  it,  along  with  a  Shockwave  3D icon.  Now you have imported it you need to bring up the Stage window and drag the Shockwave 3D member on to the stage. It is now an instance of the Cast Member, referred to as a Sprite in Director. It is at this point, if  not before, that we need to decide how big we want our movie to be. We mentioned earlier that the resulting Shockwave Movie can stretch to fill the Browser window, but you may not want to do this, so I suggest a size of 700 pixels wide and 350 pixels high. This should fit on most browsers,  but choose any size that you want, bearing in mind what else you might want on your web page, other than the 3D Shockwave movie. You could have your movie open in a new window or completely fill the screen. You would do this by using JavaScript commands in your HTML editor, such as Dreamweaver.  Once you have set the movie size, using the Property Inspector you need to position and stretch the Shockwave 3D member to fill the stage area. You can check with the Property Inspector that it fits correctly by adjusting the settings, which will now refer to the 3D sprite that you have selected.  Using the Score  Now we have our 3D sprite on our stage we need to use the Score to tidy up our movie and make the play head loop around one frame. Make the Stage window visible by pressing its icon on the top tool bar. You will see that in Sprite Channel 1, the 3D sprite is represented by a long bar. Grab  the right hand end of the bar and drag it back to frame one. The results in   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 114  114  3D for the Web  the Sprite being only visible for one frame, but this frame will be looped so that the 3D sprite is always visible.  Using a Frame Behavior  The next step is to make the movie loop around the first frame. This is a sim- ple Lingo command, ‘Go to frame 1’ and it occurs every time the play head exits the frame. This command is contained in the ‘Rotate scene and loop frame’ behavior, but it will not work until it is dragged onto the Score. The correct place to drag it is into the frame square above Sprite Channel one. You  will  see  that  there  is  a  Script  icon  on  this  row.  When  you  drag  the Frame Behavior in it will always be one frame in length, which is what we want  Figure 3.13 .  Figure 3.13 The Score window showing the Tempo, Frame Script and 3D sprite  This behavior also has other functions, if you play the movie, by pressing the Play icon, you will see that the 3D scene rotates. This is actually the cam- era orbiting around the middle of the world. You will also see that moving   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 115  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  115  the mouse up and down changes the Camera’s height. Obviously quite a bit is happening here and if you are already familiar with Lingo then you can look at the script to see how it is done.  Making your objects interactive  Now is the time to make our scene more interesting by bringing it to life. First of all we need to import some sounds. It is generally preferable to cre- ate your own sounds. You can use Windows Sound Recorder as a very basic recorder, but there is plenty of Audio Software available. If you do not want to record your own sounds then you can always buy sound sample CDs or download sounds from the Internet. As a starter we have included sounds on the CD with this book, so you can start by importing them from the Chapter 3 folder. Just right click on an empty Cast Member and select import.  Then  find  the  sounds   various  sound  file  formats  are  acceptable including .wav and .mp3 , add them to the File List and press import. Your sounds will now appear in the cast. If you imported more than one then each sound will become a Cast Member.  The next stage is to use the script that controls the motions, sounds and trig- gering. Drag the Cast Member ‘Move an object’ from the Cast window to the stage, dropping it onto the 3D sprite. A new window should appear showing many parameters as in Figure 3.14.  Figure 3.14 The ‘Move an Object’ Behavior window   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 116  116  3D for the Web  The script for this behavior controls many different properties. All you need to do is select which object in your scene that you want to move, which key you want to trigger the movement and what type of movement you want it to have. You can then select how much motion you want in the three differ- ent axes x, y and z. The amount of elasticity and friction will determine the speed and physics of the motion. Finally you can choose a sound and set the volume of that sound. There does not need to be a science to how you choose this, just experiment with different settings. Setting the elastic and friction  properties  to  extremes  can  have  pretty  wild  outcomes,  but  it  is entirely up to you what you do. Once you are happy with your settings press OK.  When you play your scene the key that you selected will trigger your move- ment and play the selected sound. If you decide that you are not happy with your settings and want to change them then, making sure you have the 3D sprite selected on the stage, go to the Behavior Inspector and double-click on the behavior. This will bring up the options for you to change.  To make more objects move, just drag another instance of the behavior from the Cast onto the 3D sprite and create settings for another object. Some of the sounds supplied on the CD are musical notes, enabling you to make a more melodic sound toy.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 117  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  117  Interview with Eduardo Carrillo http:  www.locombia.net eduardo   Profile  Eduardo Carrillo is an independent Web Artist, originally from Columbia; he now lives and works in the UK. I first met Eduardo in 2000, when he was res- ident artist at London Guildhall, and I have since followed his artistic career with interest. Eduardo relies on funding from Arts bodies to create his Web artifacts. His work ranges from creating films from naïve drawings by refugee children  to  creating  symphonic  sound-and-vision  ‘scapes’  in  collaboration with the London Sinfonietta. A dedicated fan of all things Web, Eduardo has shown with his Javadance piece that 1 day choreographers and dancers will be able to study a library of dance interactively from any angle.  Interview  How do you describe yourself, professionally? I am a Digital Artist.  Do  you  collaborate  with  other  3D  animators,  Flash  animators  and  pro- grammers, or do your skills cross-over? Yes, I work a lot with Lingo programmers. I have to work with producers on many of the projects and I like to involve musicians in the early stages of the process.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 118  118  3D for the Web  General design and 3D How did you get started in digital design? First I studied television in Columbia, and then after working for 3 years I decided  to  study  something  where  I  could  be  more  creative.  I  came  to England, and studied for an MA in computer animation. My work is more than just digital design; I am also an animator who creates digital environ- ments and worlds.  What are your inspirations design-wise? I admire a lot of video games, like ‘Black and White’ and ‘Mist’. These are games that are not just shoot-’em-ups or racing cars, but games that give you experiences when you are playing.  What do you think is the essence of good 3D design? Can you give any general tips? I believe your work has to be simple and the user must not get lost in the design. Be faithful to the universe that you are creating. The important thing is not to try to impress but to be practical and simple.  How important do you think interactivity is to your work? I believe that the Internet is a synonymy of interactivity. I cannot imagine, in the future, web pages without interactivity. One of the intrinsic characteristics   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 119  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  119  about the Internet and video games is interactivity. This will be the future of our  art,  which  will  develop  around  interactivity.  You  really  have  to  think about the user and how they are going to react with your piece of work.  What aspect of development would you say is the most time consuming? For me, to get the right idea is the most time consuming part … it is a lot of trial and error. Once you have conceived the right idea, then it is more or less easy to develop your project.  In your opinion does 3D technology have any advantages over 2D when creating websites? Yes, it gives the users more possibilities, you can see an object from all  the points of view, and also you can immerse the user in a world which you cannot do in 2D. 3D gives you the sense of feeling part of the world.  What are your thoughts on the use of interactive 3D in art? Interactive 3D in art is at its birth, it will take some time to start to develop its own language. We are just the pioneers of this. It is like video games, now we are starting to see intelligent games, not just shooting and racing. But it took several years to start to develop in different way.  Your past and future work What awards have you won and do they make a difference? For me the grants are more important than awards because the grants help you to realize your vision, they give you the money to be free. I was given a grant to make 3D Music, by the Arts Council and The Getty Foundation   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 120  120  3D for the Web  gave us the funding for the Java dance project. It really makes the difference because without their money it would have been impossible to make these projects.  How did the concept for 3D Music website come about? We really worked together with the musician, we met once a week and talked about ideas and concepts and then we developed the work alone. For example we worked with the idea of the Arctic pole and isolation and then we created the room called ‘forest glass’ in 3D Music. One week later we would meet again and change the work little by little until we felt confi- dent with the universe we created, and so on. It was very organic, the way we worked together.  What are your thoughts on collaboration with other artists? For me it is very important to work with other disciplines, as I say a good movie is not just the director’s work, but the actors, the composers, the art director, the photographer, etc. A good piece of work is not about one per- son but a group of talented people working together for a vision, the direc- tor’s or producer’s vision. So I always try to involve people from different disciplines in my projects.  Any special future projects using 3D? I am developing a project in 3D with Amnesty international in which there is a world with interviews of people talking about their personal and tragic experiences.   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 121  Chapter 3 – An introduction to real time 3D  121  I  am  also  continuing  my  work  experimenting  with  dance  using  motion  capture with Roehampton University.  Technique Can you explain your use of motion capture for your dance examples? I made 3D scans of sculptures from the 4th century, after having these sculp- tures  in  digital  form,  we  worked  with  a  dancer  to  perform  a  Javanese dance.  We  captured  his  movement  and  then  put  in  the  model  that  we already had as a 3D scan.  How easy is it to implement motion capture into a 3D project? One of the big problems of motion capture is the creation of a lot of key frames for the movement. You can, of course, optimize these movements. However, a dancer really sees the difference and to them it is quite impor- tant, even though to an animator there is not much change. So you really have to have big files instead of small files.  Are there any specific problems with using motion capture? You would think using motion capture would be straightforward and you could  apply  the  capture  files  to  the  models  and  everything  will  work smoothly. This is not the case, you really have to convert the files, and most of the files are quite big. So you really need a super computer or you need to work with movements of no longer than 45 seconds. Then you can tidy the information you have of all the movements together. The other difficulty I found is that motion capture is very good for extreme movements, jumping, running stretching, but it does not work well for gentle movements near to the body, sometimes the sensors do not pick up this gentle movement and treat it like a corrupted file  I am talking about affordable motion capture and not thousands-of-pounds motion capture systems .   Chap-03.qxd  8 12 04  15:03  Page 122  122  3D for the Web  Which  technology  do  you  think  will  be  the  leader  for  3D  on  the  Web?  For example, Shockwave, Flash, Pulse 3D, Virtools and VRML  I believed it will be Shockwave, not necessarily because it is the best but because it has a big company behind this technology; Macromedia.  Do you prefer vector 3D or highly rendered 3D? I prefer Shockwave that is like vector 3D, it takes less time to downloading and like I say above it will be the future.  Insights Do you have any advice for students of 3D Web Design? Just to keep with simple ideas, the simple ideas are the best ones. Instead of trying  to  explore  new  technologies  try  to  say  something,  look  for  good designers and try to imitate them and then you can add your own voice.  How do you get commissions for 3D work? Just meeting people, and showing your work to all the people you think can help  you.  Meeting  people  is  a  key  factor  in  the  industry,  sometimes  the clients do not have the time to look for the best one, but for the handiest per- son. Going to seminars, master classes and meeting with people.  3D has almost taken over the games industry; do you think it will become predominant in Web Design? Yes, Yes and Yes! I will put my hand on fire over that. When broadband is common in households I believe 3D design will explode. It will be great because then the only limit will be the sky and beyond that, because we won’t have to worry about the size of files.  Does  current  Web  technology  allow  you  to  achieve  all  of  your  creative ideas, what improvements would you like to see from software? I would like there to be improvements in how sound is handled and for there to be better rendering, a better quality in picture. It would be great if you could use all your particle systems translated into 3D software.

I once added up all the different hats a student needs to wear to make a short animated film. It is quite a list:    Starting with the Producer who has an idea …   The Writer creates the story and dialog.   Casting Agent. The 3D modeler models the characters.   Make-up and Costumes. Then chooses materials and maps them onto the  characters.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 124  124  3D for the Web    Sound records the necessary tracks and times them.

The Set Designer and Props will decide what needs to be in shot and  what does not, the age, style and entire look of the set.

And throughout, the Producer budgets for equipment you can afford to do all this on, and timetables the work while selling the film for distribution.  That is up to 17 jobs all with different hats. Oh, and you have to self-cater too. Many of these jobs are staffed by people with decades of experience in their craft. As far as 3D student film making goes, it is worth remembering that the filmmaker’s role is not only that of the Director, but also the entire pre-production, production and post-production crew. Feeling daunted?  If animation is such hard work, why undertake the sheer hard graft of it all? Because its magic, that’s why.  It is human instinct to communicate, to tell stories and share experiences. Animation  has  a  way  of  communicating  at  a  most  fundamental  level.  A child walking into a room where a cartoon is playing on television will stop and watch as if drawn by a magnet; the attraction is immediate. That is why cartoon characters are used to endorse products. This same instant appeal is why we have The Jolly Green Giant and the Frostie’s Tiger.  I  have  a  pet  theory  that  all  animators  are  anarchists.  They  have  looked  at  the  world  and  said  ‘Preeety  good  going,  God,  but  what’s  with  the  camel?   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 125  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  125  You could not decide one hump or two? And, not to get too heavy, but  gravity,  couldn’t  you  just  have  made  life  just  a  bit  more,  well,  bouncy?  Come  on  I  can  do  better  than  that!  What  if  we  took  an  armadillo  and added it to a kangaroo – Now you are talking! And while we are on the subject, get a move on with those Aliens; we need some new blood around here!’  You, as an animator get the chance to play God; a chance to create your own Adam and Eve and put them through their paces.  So here we are. We want to play God, and we want to tell a story. The first thing we need to think about is making a character. As animation is such hard work; you would better love your character, you will be spending a  lot of time with them! And this is particularly relevant in 3D because you have to pay a lot of attention to not just how the character looks, but how it is constructed.  Character design When deciding to cast your animation, the first thing you should think about is your audience. Is your character going to interact with the real world or be part of a kid’s game? Realism versus caricature, or entirely imaginary? Always design so that your characters are exceedingly appealing to your audience.  The approach you have decided upon will dictate the proportions of your character. Realistic humanoids are roughly six heads high. Cartoon char- acters are four heads for more natural looking characters, and two-and-a- half  to  three  heads  high  for  classic  cartoon  proportions.  This  is  because two-and-a-half heads high is a child’s proportion which is naturally appeal- ing – E.T. was not the shape he was for nothing. Most animation is made with a target audience of 6–14 year olds. For the Web, you will have no control over your audience, but you should know whom you want to appeal to most; that demographic is whom you are aiming for.  How to design a character in 3D  Many people prefer to design a character on paper first, and that is cer- tainly what most teachers would advocate in character design. Although I have noticed more and more students today like to roll up their sleeves and build straight into 3D – it depends on your experience.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 126  126  3D for the Web  There are certain cartoon shorthands that can be used:    Bigger eyes, smaller size  cid:2  More goofy.   Small eyes, taller  cid:2  More intelligent.   Fat  cid:2  Lazy.   Spectacles  cid:2  Boffin.   Large  Breasts  cid:2  Foxy  woman   no  design  of  a  nuclear  physicist  would  include massive mammaries .    String of Pearls  cid:2  Domestic woman  Wilma Flintstone, Marge Simpson .   Baby proportions  cid:2  Innocence.  Another way of looking at cartoon shorthands is to read them as prejudices. They can  and perhaps should  be subverted. Lisa Simpson’s a boffin, but she does not wear glasses. Pinky and the Brain reverse the look for smart and stupid. These are shorthands and not rules. Let us have a look at a  specific example.  In Figure 4.1, I have designed an archetypical Bully on paper. What are the reasons behind my design? He is almost Neanderthal, with a heavy brow and his knuckles almost reach the ground. He is designed with a big, pug- nacious jaw, low center of gravity, and a massive, awesome chest. I have given him small eyes to remove appeal, and an aggressive  but not offen- sive  logo on his chest. I left the Bully character deliberately square with no mesh smoothing apart from his head. I wanted him to look like a walking crate. The finished model is shown in Figure 4.2.  I have lit him with a massive, scary shadow to make him more daunting. And put a flower in his hand to subvert stereotypes!  Figure 4.1 Bully designed on paper  three-and-a-half heads high    Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 127  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  127  Figure 4.2 The finished Bully model  Modeling in 3D One  way  of  modeling  from  a  drawing  is  to  scan  your  drawings  and  put them into the 3D environment so you can work from them. To do this, create  two  planes  at  right  angles  to  each  other.  Bring  in  your  front  and  side drawings as bitmaps and assign them as color  diffuse  maps to the planes. Click on the ‘Show Map in viewport’ icon for each material and adjust  their  position  using  UVW  mapping.  You  can  then  create  a  box  3  cid:3  4  cid:3  3 segments is usual , convert it to an Editable Mesh and fit the vertices to the drawing outlines in the side and front  orthogonal  viewports  Figure 4.3 .  Figure 4.3 How to build a character from a projected drawing in 3D   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 128  128  3D for the Web  Note  For animation purposes, it is customary to build a character in ‘star pose’  standing with their arms out and their legs apart . The reason for this is that if the mesh is to be animated using deformation tech- niques  i.e. bones or biped , it is very useful to keep the spheres of influence as separate as possible.  The finished Bully is made from separate boxes for the legs, arms and chest and a tapered oiltank for the head. His hair is a cylinder  Figure 4.4 .  Figure 4.4 The completed polygonal mesh  The eyes have it Watch any close-up of a lead actor in a movie, and see how their eyes glint. We register and read all emotions in our eyes; they are the window to our souls. Most characters you build in 3D will have eyes, in fact adding eyes to just about anything, makes it a character. In 3D there are two things you want from eyes; that they look great, and are easy to control. This tutorial shows a way of building eyes with lots of character that are fun to animate.  Create a sphere that has 32 segments. Label it R-eyeball. Select the sphere with the Uniform Scale tool and Shift-drag to create a second slightly larger   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 129  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  129  sphere. Set the hemisphere spinner to 0.5. Call this R-eyelid. Convert this hemisphere to an Editable Mesh to tweak the eyelid vertices at the edge into a nice, perky shape for definition.  Select the original R-eyeball with the Scale tool and clone a third sphere, mid-size between the two others for the pupil. Set the hemisphere spinner to about 0.85 and rotate the pupil so it looks at you from the front viewport. Label this R-pupil. Link the pupil to the eyeball using the ‘Link’ tool from the main toolbar.  Assign  suitable  materials  to  each  object,  such  as  a  white  shiny  eyeball, black pupil, etc. Select all three Modified Spheres and copy them to the right to make the left eye. Re-label these ‘L’  Figure 4.5 .  Figure 4.5 Two basic eyes  Now we are going to add controllers for blinking and orientating the pupils.  Top Tip For this to work correctly it is essential that the pivot points of all the spheres remain aligned. The pivot point  which represents an object’s local center and its place in the local coordinate system  on any object is where the Gizmo is positioned when an object is selected. It is typi- cally in the center of a sphere or cube when first created. To align  or re-align   pivot  points  use  the  ‘Align’  tool  in  the  main  toolbar.  Select  the object you wish to align, click on the tool  which will highlight in yellow  and select the object you wish to align to.  First we are going to add a Dummy to control blinking. A Dummy, helper object is a wireframe cube with a pivot point at its geometric center that does not render. You can create a Dummy by going to the Helpers panel and choosing Dummy  Figure 4.6 .  Create the Dummy by Click-dragging midway between the two eyes in the top viewport. Adjust its orientation so that it is aligned on the Y- and Z-axis   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:04  Page 130  130  3D for the Web  Figure 4.6 The Helpers panel  with the pivot points of the eyeballs. Link the two eyelids to the Dummy. Select the Dummy and select ‘Local’ from the Reference Coordinate System in the main toolbar  where it reads ‘View’, next to the Scale tool . This will make sure that the Dummy will rotate on the same axis whichever viewport you use. Rotate the Dummy on the X-axis, to check that the eyelids make a smooth blink.  If they do not, then re-align your objects.  Label the Dummy ‘Blink-Dummy’.  Now let us add a Dummy to control where the pupils look. In the top view- port create a Dummy that sits in front of the eyes, and some distance away.  This is where the eyes will look at, so imagine a character sitting directly opposite.  Rename this Dummy, ‘Lookat Dummy’.  Select the R-pupil and hit the Motion Panel button. In Parameters  cid:4  Assign Controller, select ‘Rotation’, click on the ‘?’ button, and select the ‘LookAt Constraint’ from the Assign Controller menu  Figure 4.7 .  Under  LookAt  Constraint,  click  on  Add  LookAt  Target,  and  choose  the Lookat  Dummy  you  have  created.  Your  pupil  will  probably  flip  to  the back of the eyeball. Select the LookAt axis Z, and the pupil will return, there  should  be  a  blue  line  heading  away  from  the  pupil  towards  the Dummy.   If  the  pupil  still  does  not  point  the  right  way,  click  on  Reset Orientation and rotate it into the correct position.  Do the same for the L pupil. Check it is all working by moving the Lookat Dummy and seeing if the pupils follow.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 131  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  131  Figure 4.7 The Assign Controller menu  Note  If you think you will need to move the pupils separately at some point, create two Lookat Dummies, one for each eye and group them after adding the LookAt Constraint. If you want your character to wink, you will have to unlink one eyelid, or if it has a nervous tic, make two blink Dummies.  These two Dummy Helpers will really speed things up when animating eyes, now let us concentrate on making them look great. We are going to add a Space Warp to give the eyes character.  Click  on  the  ‘Create’  button  and  choose  Space  Warps  cid:4  Geometric  Deformable. In the top viewport create an FFD box big enough to encom- pass the R-eyeball and Eyelid. Position the FFD Space Warp to fit over the R-eye. It will look like a lattice with 4  cid:3  4  cid:3  4 control points. It is a good idea, under the Space Warp Parameters  cid:4  Deform, to click on ‘All vertices’ here, so none accidentally escapes the FFD lattice  Figure 4.8 .  Name this R-eye-FFD box.  Next use the ‘Bind to Space Warp’ tool from the top menu bar, to bind the Right eyeball, eyelid and pupil to the FFD Space Warp.  As it binds, the control vertices of the FFD Space Warp flash white.   Create another FFD Space Warp and do the same to the left eye.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 132  132  3D for the Web  Figure 4.8 The Create  cid:4  Space Warps panel   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 133  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  133  Figure 4.9 Here’s looking at you, kid  Select  the  Right-eye-FFD  box  and  under  the  modify  panel  open  the  Sub- Object rollout to select ‘Control Points’. By selecting and moving the control points of each FFD Box, you can change the shape of each eye  Figure 4.9 .  The eyes should not only look good and expressive, but still animate fluidly using the Dummy controllers, because 3ds max works through the Modifier Stack from the bottom up.  You can hide the FFD boxes when animating, as they get in the way of seeing the expressions.   Top Tip You may also want to create a Target Spotlight for your eyes to give them that lead actor glint. You can link this to the Master Dummy as well, so the eyes will always have a keylight.  It just remains to make sure all the links are correct and to link the whole lot to a Dummy so that the eyes are easy to move around en masse. Create a large Dummy over the eyes and call it Eyes-MasterDummy. This will be our Master Dummy.  Because the Blink-Dummy is already controlling the eyelids, and the eye- balls already control the pupils, you should link everything but the eyelids and pupils to the Master Dummy  Figure 4.10 .   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 134  134  3D for the Web  Figure 4.10 The object subtree, showing the linked hierarchy of the eyes  Note  The eyes can be tricky to resize, so try and resize your character to the eyes rather than the other way around. Also remember that although these eyes look great, they are heavy on polygons.  Creating a quirky character for Flash A single character can be fun on the Web. You can make a visitor interact by running looped films in Flash. The visitor can often be fooled into think- ing they are interacting far more than they actually are, and you can man- age to keep wonderful lighting and high polygon counts in your rendered films. The Who’s We and Neostream sites are great examples of this.  In this next exercise, I built the Hitme character specifically for this purpose. He is animated using hierarchical links with bones for deformation, and sports the same eyes that we have just made. I started by making a sketch of the Hitme character  Figure 4.11 .  The idea behind the Hitme character, as the name suggests, is that the Web visitor can amuse themselves by tormenting him. When designing the charac- ter, I knew that I wanted something that would be fun to animate in extremes. Because I had no restrictions on materials, lighting or polygons, I have used Raytrace materials and a lot of Mesh Smooths giving a high poly count.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 135  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  135  Figure 4.11 The original sketch for the Hitme character, and the finished article  I  have  given  the  character  a  spherical  body  for  bounce  and  expressive hands for waving around; the white gloves will make his hand movements register more  A trick Disney used for Mickey Mouse . I decided against the writing on his stomach, as I want him to appeal globally, instead I have given him glossy stripes that emphasize his roundness, and are reminiscent of Uderzo’s Obelix or Tenniel’s version of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The feet are large, as he needs a stable base and will not be walking around. Having built the character in 3D, I thought his throat looked kind of vulner- able and needed breaking up, so I also gave him a red bowtie. Also, I must confess that red bowties have the same effect on me as red rags to a bull;  I invariably feel like hitting anyone who wears them. Perhaps my audience feels the same, and if not, hey, I can indulge myself – it is my character!  Creating the Hitme character Most of the character is made from simple spheres and cylinders. The feet, hands and head are made with polygonal modeling from boxes, and then adding a Mesh Smooth modifier  Figure 4.12 .  Before linking and fitting bones to the character, I moved the pivot points on some objects so that the centers of rotation would be in the right place for animation. As shown when you aligned the eyes, the pivot point can be moved to anywhere you want, which is a helpful tool particularly for ani- mating rotations. To move a pivot point, select the object, go to ‘Hierarchy’   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 136  136  3D for the Web  Figure 4.12 Making the head from a polygonal box, before adding a Mesh Smooth modifier  Figure 4.13 Moving the pivot point  and click on ‘Affect Pivot Only’  Figure 4.13 . Now you can move the pivot point to any new desired position in a viewport. Click off ‘Affect Pivot Only’.  Note  It is essential that any adjustments to pivot points are made before ani- mating, as it is not a parameter that is animatable.  I  dropped  the  pivot  point  for  the  character’s  body  to  the  bottom  of  the sphere, and moved the pivot points on his feet to where his ankles would be. The arms pivot from the joints and the lower mandible from the hinge through his jaw  Figure 4.14 .   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 137  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  137  Figure 4.14 Positioning the new pivot points  Before we add some bones for mesh deformation and link it all up, let me explain how linked hierarchies animate in 3D.  Forward and Inverse Kinematics When you create a linked hierarchy, you are in effect making a series of parent–child  links,  where  the  parent  drives  the  child.  If  you  imagine  this series of links as tree branches spreading from a single trunk: the trunk is par- ent to the boughs, the boughs are parents to the branches, and the branches are parents to the twigs. In Forward Kinematics the last link in the chain, the twig, will inherit any rotations you make to any of the parents. Similarly mov- ing the last link, the twig, will not affect any other part of the tree. In Inverse Kinematics, as the name indicates, the situation is reversed and the child drives the parents. This makes it a wonderful tool for animating walks and allowing characters to interact with objects. For instance, it would be dif- ficult for a character to point to a place on a map if you started by rotating the shoulder joint, then worked your way down the hierarchy to the finger. Inverse Kinematics allows you to move the finger to the correct position and   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 138  138  3D for the Web  it solves how the other joints or parents move. I will talk more about this  in  Chapter  6.  We  will  be  animating  the  Hitme  character  using  Forward Kinematics, because he does not need to walk or interact with any object.  Select the mesh for the hands and the head and lower mandible and freeze it by R-clicking in a viewport and choosing ‘Freeze Selection’. The mesh will turn a uniform gray. Freezing the mesh stops us selecting it while we create and adjust the bones. Bones are found under the Create Panel  cid:4  Systems  Figure 4.15 .  Figure 4.15 Creating bones  Note  Bones are a jointed, hierarchical system that can be used to deform mesh objects with the addition of a ‘Skin’ or ‘Physique’ modifier. They offer a quicker solution to animating using Forward or Inverse Kinem- atics as you can apply ready solvers in the program.  Click on ‘Bones’ and, in a side viewport, create a row of three bones trav- eling  from  the  bottom  of  the  head  to  the  jaw-bolt  by  Click-dragging. Continue following the line of the head and upper jaw with a further six bones.  R-click to stop creating bones.  Now click back on the head of the third bone, and you will be able to create another chain of bones for the lower mandible, emanating from the same jaw-bolt pivot.  The first click in a viewport defines the start of a bone, and the second click defines the start of the second bone. Visually it will look like you have  created  only  one  bone,  as  the  bones  drawn  are  merely  visual aids defining a linked hierarchy between pivot points. Each new bone created is a ‘child’ of the previous bone.  Note   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 139  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  139  Now create the bones for the hand as shown in Figure 4.16.  Figure 4.16 Positioning the bones  Top Tip Position hands, or any object that is to be boned, so that the mesh runs parallel to a viewport. Then create all of the bones in that viewport.  Make sure that you check the position of the bones from the other viewports too, the better they fit now, the easier it will be to fit and manipulate the mesh.  Top Tip The  first  bone   in  this  case  at  the  bones  in  the  wrists  and  neck   are ‘Parents’. Each subsequent bone is in a Parent  cid:4  Child chain. When creating chains of bones, try and connect them in natural chains so  the  program  will  label  them  in  sequence  and  they  will  be  easier  to identify later.  Now let us link the whole character together. Typically all characters are linked to a parent that starts at the hip. In the Hitme’s character that means linking  the  feet  to  the  body  and  linking  the  neck  sphere  to  the  body. Everything  else  is  linked  in  sequence  to  the  ‘Neck’  sphere.  The  bones already have a linked hierarchy, and you only need to link the three parent bones at the wrists and the neck to the next bone in the hierarchy. Thus each   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 140  140  3D for the Web  wrist bone is linked to the lower arms, then the lower arms to the elbows, the elbows to the upper arms and the upper arms to the neck. Link the hair and  the  eye  Master  Dummy  to  the  nearest  bone  so  they  do  not  get  left behind  Figure 4.17 .  Figure 4.17 The Hitme head hierarchy  Note that we do not link the mesh for the hands and the head, as they will be bonded automatically to the bones when we have added the ‘Skin’ or ‘Physique’ modifier.  Applying the Skin modifier There  are  two  ways  of  fitting  a  mesh  to  bones  in  3ds  max:  ‘Skin’  and ‘Physique’.  Note  Physique is a modifier that comes with Max’s Character Studio and I describe  fitting  a  Mesh  with  that  in  the  following  chapter.  I  find  the Physique interface more adaptable and faster to use, it can be used for bones or biped and exports more easily to Shockwave. However, here we will use the Skin modifier as we do not need to worry about exporting to Shockwave.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 141  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  141  Unfreeze the mesh and add a Skin modifier to the left hand mesh. Click on Parameters  cid:4  Add, and select the relevant bones from the Selection List. In this case the bones required are Bones 35–52  Figure 4.18 .  Figure 4.18 Adding the Skin modifier to the left hand  Now click on ‘Edit Envelopes’ which will highlight in yellow. Click some of your selected bones, one at a time and observe what happens in your view- ports.  Each  bone  comes  equipped  with  two  default  envelopes,  an  inner, bright red one and an outer dark red one. All vertices that fall inside the inner envelope will be 100% influenced by that particular bone, with a falloff in the outer envelope. If you click on the ‘Weight Table’ you will see that each vertex has been assigned a weight by the Skin modifier and that Weight cor- responds to particular bones. For a vertex to be influenced 100% by a bone, it will be given a value of one. A value of zero means there is no influence.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 142  142  3D for the Web  The reason the Skin modifier deforms a mesh is typically because the envel- opes of adjoining bones overlap causing the vertices in the mesh to be influ- enced by more than one bone. You can change the weights by typing in different values in the table  but that is rather too labor intensive for our uses . There are several other ways of fitting these envelopes and adjusting weights. Select vertices and the middle bone of the middle finger  Figure 4.19 .  Figure 4.19 Bone 41 with Select  cid:4  Vertices on  You should be able to see that while the inner envelope is only affecting the relevant vertices in the finger, the falloff in the outer envelope also means that the bone is influencing vertices in the adjacent fingers. We could bring the  outer  envelope  in  by  selecting  its  cross-sections  and  scaling  them inwards  with  the  Scale  tool  or  changing  the  radius,  but  fitting  hands  to bones is about as fiddly as it gets when using the Skin modifier, and frankly it is easier to change these settings at vertex level, bone by bone.  Marquee-select all the vertices in the adjoining fingers  it does not matter if you  pick  up  more  than  were  being  influenced   and  click  on  the  button marked ‘Exclude Verts’. They will lose their color and turn into black out- lined squares, this means they are now excluded from the bone’s influence.  Top Tip Lining up your hand with the grid in the viewport will make it much easier to marquee-select vertices when fitting the Skin modifier.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 143  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  143  Select  each  bone  in  turn  and  eliminate  any  unwanted  influences  from nearby bones inside the mesh, so the mesh for each finger is only influenced by the bones running through it. The hand bones can stay as they are, as you want them to assist the finger bones. If you make a mistake, you can select any vertex and assign it to a bone with the ‘Include Verts’ button.  Check  the  bones  are  deforming  the  mesh  well  by  selecting  some  bones  and  rotating  them.  Now  go  through  the  same  process  with  the  other  hand.  It is not possible to copy or mirror a mesh with bones attached in Studio Max 5.   You can use the same method for fitting the bones in the head of the charac- ter, or adjust the envelope size as suggested earlier. The bones should fit a lot more effectively anyway and there is no problem of unwanted overlap- ping influence as the jaw mesh has its own set of separate bones. The most likely problem, if any, is that some vertices escape having any bone influ- encing them at all. To correct this, it is necessary to adjust the size of the envel- ope. To do this, again select ‘Edit Envelopes’, select the bone and this time click in one of the red squares of a cross-section in the viewport. The cross- section will highlight in pink and the Envelope Properties  cid:4  Radius spinner is made operable. Crank the spinner up until you have captured any stray ver- tices that had escaped. This can be done interactively whilst you view the effect in the viewport.  Fit the jaw in the same way, and check everything is working properly.  Animating the Hitme character Pose your character in a good starting position and save it as your basic character  Figure 4.20 . Select every part of the character and each bone and create a Key at frame 0.  You can do this by selecting everything and clicking on the Set Keys button in the bottom timeline menu bar.   Top Tip When building a character and setting it up, you must always have an idea of how you will want to animate it. It will not always be the same for every animation you want to do, so it is important to save a version of your character with the hierarchy intact, and keep that file clean. This is even more important if you are creating looped animations as we are here. Make sure you have set up a camera to a position that will allow you to include all of your animations in the frame.  Do not forget to leave room for shadows if you have them.    Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 144  144  3D for the Web  Figure 4.20 The basic Hitme character awaiting animation  I have created a number of animations designed for pseudo interactivity. Each is created in a separate file from the basic character. That way, I know that there will be no jerkiness or movement between the different movies when they are played.  There is not enough room in this book to go into all the details of animation and  it  is  well  worth  investing  in  one  of  the  books  recommended  in  the appendix if you want to study animation in any depth. However, as a broad ‘quickie’ introduction let us look at an animation whose file is on the CD.  Top Tip I have added a blink to the basic character file, as I know I will need the character to blink in every scenario and I can move it to an appro- priate place in any animation, or copy it for more blinks. This saves having  to  create  a  new  blink  in  every  file.  If  my  character  had  any other consistent tics traits, I would also add them to the basic file.  Open the basic character file and save a new version called ‘Dodge’. Set the timeline frame count to 50 frames. Check that you are running at the PAL rate of 25 frames per second  fps . I have positioned the Hitme character in a three-quarter profile because he looks best this way. There would however be  some  advantage  in  filming  a  symmetrical  character  head  on,  as  this would enable any motion to be flipped and save time in animation.  The Hitme character is posed with his hands resting on his rounded stomach and  gazing  stage  right.  The  intention  in  the  animation  is  to  make  him quickly dodge backwards and away, and then return to rest.  The first movement in the animation is to get the character to look towards camera. Select the Lookat Dummies and set a key at frame 6. In the Motion   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 145  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  145  Panel  cid:4  Key Info  Basic  make this Key a ‘Hold In’ and ‘Ease Out’. Go to frame 8, move the Dummies to make the character look at camera and set another key, this time with an Ease In and a Hold Out. Without adding these extra interpolations to the keys, the eyeballs would slide around under the influence of the default Bezier controllers.  Animation hint: all eye move- ments tend to be fast with holds at the end.   At frame 14 select the body and again set a key with a Hold In. This is the beginning of the character jerking backwards. Move to frame 19 and rotate the body backwards. Set keys for the first three bones of the neck at 14 as well. These bend backwards with a delay of one frame traveling up the body.  Animation hint: this ripple effect is called ‘follow through’ in animation, where all movements start from the hips and travel outwards, ending at the extrem- ities.  I have also rotated the neck to the character’s right as it helps accentuate the movement from the camera angle I have chosen  Figure 4.21 .  Figure 4.21 Hitme dodging  frame 19   As you can see from Figure 4.21, I have balanced this sudden movement backwards by rotating the lower arms forward so his hands help balance him and lifting his left foot. This is a fast movement and he is at full stretch at frame 19. I have held him there for three frames before returning him  to his upright position. The hands go back to rest by frame 30 and 31.  Animation hint: a staggered movement looks more natural.  At frame 35, the character blinks and looks away, back to where he started. The blink combined with looking up is a classic ‘Tch’ expression – it has an exasper- ated ‘don’t be so childish’ feel to it. The blink is created with a slight bounce to the eyelid so that the eyes open wider as the lids come up, and then  settle into the normal pose. By copying the keys from the beginning of the rest pose for each part of the body by Shift-dragging in the timeline, I can guarantee that the character has return to his original position. The hold at the end is to allow time for the hair to stop moving as the Flex modifier  finishes animating it  Figure 4.22 .   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 146  146  3D for the Web  Figure 4.22 The animated Hitme dodge   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 147  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  147  This animation is the shortest and simplest of the examples on the website. The other animations that you will find are for twanging the Hitme’s bowtie, making him laugh, and a giant belch. I could have done any number of things to the character: the only limits are your imagination and the file sizes.  Making the animation interactive By now you will have created some interesting animations for our Hitme character. This is very nice, but how do we actually hit him? He needs to be interactive if he is going to have the desired effect of being an engaging and  entertaining  character.  Essentially,  he  is  going  to  be  an  animated  button. He will interact with the mouse, which will trigger different anima- tions.  It  makes  sense  that  pressing  the  mouse  button  on  parts  of  Hitme’s body makes him perform certain actions, or he could even respond if we just passed the pointer over him.  We are going to use Macromedia Flash to make our Hitme character inter- active. There are essentially two ways to output your files as high quality renders. One is to save that animation as a video file, e.g. QuickTime or AVI, the other is to save individual frames. Up until now we have rendered all our animations as individual frames. This had some advantages, in that we  could  composite  layers  in  Flash,  using  PNGs  with  transparent  back- ground.  Another  reason  for  this  was  animation  quality  and  compression issues with rendered video. However, the world of animation and Web cre- ation is ever changing and what could not be done well one year, can be done well the next. Such is the case for us. It is now possible to import  digital video files and edit them  with regards to where the clips start and stop , adjust the compression and output them at a decent quality with man- ageable file sizes. What we did with the turtle button was a useful tech- nique, but now we can output files as digital video.  Rendering your animations  With an ever-watchful eye on file sizes, we want to render our animations in the most efficient manner. In the Render Scene window, select the Files but- ton and choose MOV QuickTime File as the Save File type. Click ‘Setup’ to set the compression options. It should default to animation as a compression style, but you will see that there are many more options available. In short, they  are  all  different  ways  of  compressing  files.  Some  are  good  for  full screen video, some are best for imagery that gradually changes, some have very good compression  Figure 4.23 . Sticking to animation at ‘Best’ qual- ity should be fine for our purposes though, as Flash will re-compress the files when we import them into it. Make the motion setting at 25 fps or 30 fps if that is your desired frame rate.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 148  148  3D for the Web  Figure 4.23 The compression settings for a QuickTime movie  Render all your animations in this way. You will need as many animations as you have movements and each movement will go back to the original position of Hitme. We cannot blend animations on-the-fly using this method  we will cover this in a later chapter . We have to go back to the initial state before  we  can  play  a  new  animation.  The  animations  were  looped  to ensure that our character’s different movements merge seamlessly.  Importing the animations  Flash MX 2004 has some improvements when it comes to importing video. As well as adjusting the compression of the imported movie, you can edit it for length. Start a new Flash movie and import your QuickTime Movies, one at a time on to separate layers. Make sure you select the ‘Embed video in Macromedia Flash document’ option. The next window will allow you to import the entire movie, or edit it first. And the final window will ask you what  compression  you  would  like,  choose  DSL Cable  512  kilobytes  per second  Figure 4.24 .  Once you have imported your animations, align them along the timeline  so that when one finishes, the next one starts. An example would be Layer One  –  frames  1–40,  Layer  Two  –  frames  41–97,  Layer  Three  –  frames 98–160  Figure 4.25 .  When you play the Flash movie, all the animations should play smoothly. You may need to adjust the positions of them if they did not all appear in the same place. Just select the appropriate keyframe, click on the animation and nudge the frames around with the arrow keys.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 149  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  149  Figure 4.24 The QuickTime editing window in Macromedia Flash MX 2004  Figure 4.25 The Macromedia Flash timeline for the Hitme animated character   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 150  150  3D for the Web  Note  You may want to create guidelines to help you align your animations. Go the View  cid:4  Rulers menu option. You can then drag guides down and across from the ruler bars that appear. You can adjust the guide- lines by selecting and dragging them.  The next stage will be to add frame actions to make the animations jump back to frame one when they reach the end. Create a new Layer and insert keyframes  at  the  end  of  each  animation.  In  the  Actions  window  add  a ‘gotoAndStop 1 ;’ command. This will make sure the character’s position is reset allowing the user to select a new animation  a new movement .  Triggering the movements  So how do we get our Hitme guy to react to the mouse? The simplest answer is to use hotspots. Hotspots are just buttons, which will appear over the char- acter. The buttons will be invisible and so become ‘hot’ or ‘interactive’ areas of the screen. You will need to have a hotspot to trigger each of your ani- mations. I have simply used a rectangle shape, which has been turned into a Movie Clip symbol. I dragged a few instances of this onto the Hitme char- acter, making sure they appear in four new layers. Scaling and positioning these instances allowed me to specify exactly where the animations could be triggered  Figure 4.26 .  Figure 4.26 The hotspots over the Hitme character  The next thing to do is to decide how to trigger the animations. The main options are rolling over the hotspot  on rollover  or pressing the mouse but- ton when over the hotspots  on press . In the featured Hitme character, there are four movements. A Dodge and a Tickle are operated by a rollover com- mand and the Burp is triggered by a Press command  Figure 4.27 . The fourth animation, the bowtie, is slightly more complicated. To add to the tension of the animation, you can hold down the mouse button, which pulls   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 151  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  151  Figure 4.27 The action to trigger the dodge movement  Figure 4.28 Twanging the bowtie  out the bowtie  Figure 4.28 . There is a stop command on the frame where the bowtie is fully extended. Then there is a play command twice, in an on release action and an on releaseOutside action. This way whether the user drags the bowtie or just holds the mouse down, the animation should play successfully. This technique is slightly more interactive than just a simple press.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 152  152  3D for the Web  Interview with Neostream http:  www.neostream.com  Company profile  Neostream is a company that sets new standards in interactive Web design. Originally located in Sydney, Australia, the company was established in 1998, and swiftly started raking in awards including the World best web- sites Gold award for their impressive home site. In 2001 they opened a branch in Korea, and have continued their pursuit of excellence as they expand into game development, and character animation for Web, TV and commercials.  It was seeing Neostream’s home site that really confirmed for me that I wanted to write the book you are reading now. Their solid design principles back up an  excellent,  elegant  and  totally  appealing  introduction  to  the  company.  I think their character ‘Shockboy’ is the best example I have seen on the Web of a company’s brand being personified. Visit this site, you will love it!   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 153  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  153  Interview  This  interview  is  with  Johnny  Choi,  their  Director  of  Planning  and Communications.  What is your role at Neostream? Apart from management operations, my primary role at Neostream is to man- age and control project communications and oversee project management.  Can you describe the background to your company, its aims, ambitions and client base? Neostream was established in Australia originally by three founding members who are still actively driving the company. Our ambitions are clear and simple. To be the elite source in providing multimedia services. Although we are much closer to fulfilling that ambition than when we started, there is still much to achieve and barriers to overcome. Our client base is spread throughout the world ranging from large corporations to small start-up companies.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 154  154  3D for the Web  How many people work at Neostream? Apart from management and administration staff, there are currently nine production members at Neostream.  Typically how many people would work on a project? Although it depends on the scale of the project, typically a project is comprised of about five people – A project manager  communications and task manage- ment , creative director, developer, Flash developer and creative designer.  Could you describe your typical work process? We usually spend at least half a project’s overall time in Pre-production, meeting the clients and establishing a project’s objective. Each project is carefully planned before production, so we have identified the  key  tasks,  goals  and  deliverables.  All  intelligence  and  content  is  gathered, organized and analyzed, then a strategic plan is developed for production to follow. In pre-production we also create a site storyboard and test any design samples that have been developed. Prior  to  launch  the  site  is  thoroughly  tested  for  overall  usability,  creative appeal, adherence to project goals and satisfaction of technical requirements.  Do you have separate 3D animators, Flash animators and programmers, or do the skills cross-over? The  main  production  staff  at  Neostream  each  has  their  primary  roles. Although minor tasks can cross-over where it is more efficient, essentially their input towards a project is based on their specialization.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 155  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  155  Who handles the sound and what impact does sound bring to your sites? Sound is usually handled by our local sound production agency. Not all projects include sound production and its feasibility is decided during initial scope and ideation sessions. Where fit, sound certainly adds impact to the overall creative theme and enhances appeal to the viewer.  On your website, you are selling some of your Flash script and sound effects is this for commercial or educational reasons? The main reason we are offering some scripts and sound loops are due to an overwhelming request from industry fellows and students. There are cur- rent plans to develop and release much more items of this nature. We are trying to offer products that are actually useful to students and industry fel- lows and we are putting a reasonable price tag basically to re-coup devel- opment costs and to minimize public duplication.  Technique What software did you use for creating the Neostream website? Apart from the usual graphic editing, drawing and Web development soft- ware, the main softwares used were Flash MX and 3ds max.  Does it vary from project to project? Although  the  main  graphic  tools  and  Web  authoring  software  do  not change often, 3D programs, sound editing programs and plug-ins are used depending on the requirements and specs set.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 156  156  3D for the Web  Why did you use Flash for your website? For several reasons. Firstly, it is now a widely accepted Web development software. It was the most feasible means of delivering our website concept for people to see conveniently. Probably the biggest reason is our accumu- lated  knowledge  of  Flash.  We  have  been  familiar  with  Flash  and  have experimented with its capabilities ever since we started. Not only do we know what it can do, more importantly, we know what it cannot do.  How  much  programming action  scripting  do  you  use  in  creating  your  website? In terms of programming, our website involved some unique action scripting. Apart  from  standard  scripting  involved  in  site  navigation,  scripts  were  custom developed, tested and adjusted to be applied in bringing the char- acter to life and enhancing user interaction.   Chap-04.qxd  8 12 04  15:05  Page 157  Chapter 4 – Designing and making characters  157  Were there any specific problems you had to overcome? Most  of  what  can  be  seen  and  experienced  at  Neostream’s  website  is unique. As with everything else, the main barrier that needed to be over- come  was  actually  making  what  we  had  mentally  visualized.  Character interaction  timing  issues,  optimization  and  animation  sequence  timings were the main technical challenge. However, the most difficult problem was to adhere and stick to the site concept and actually deliver the intended visual through the character and animations.  What was the most challenging aspect of bringing the concept of Shockboy to life? Shockboy was just a 2D metaphor, a symbol and a concept. The main chal- lenge was to induce life into the character and add attributes. Not only the character needed to reflect the characteristics of Neostream, it needed to have a body and soul of its own. We try not to think of Shockboy as just a company mascot but a lively character that will grow with the company.

When making a character for export to Shockwave, the ﬁrst thing to decide is how you want your character to animate. You can use linked hierarchies as with the turtle, or deformable meshes, which use ‘Bones’ or ‘Biped’, but you cannot use both combined as we did with the Hitme character. Either way if you want to export your character via Shockwave, you will need to keep the polygon count low.  If you are modeling for an interactive character for export to the Web, you must use polygonal modeling.  Note  There  are  other  modeling  techniques  beside  polygonal,  such  as  Nurbs  Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines  and Patch modeling. Both can be used for character modeling: Nurbs modeling relies on joining curved Splines in space to create a smooth surface. It is quite a popular technique for character modeling in Maya, and it does take most modifiers, particu- larly  the  Morpher  modifier  well.  Patch  modeling  is  where  you  create patches,  which  are  a  bit  like  squares  of  material.  Figures  are  built  by stitching  these  patches  together  rather  like  making  clothes  from  a    Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 160  160  3D for the Web  pattern.  This  is  a  great  modeling  tool  for  cloth  simulation.  Both  Nurbs and Patch models tend to be harder to Texture map. In terms of animat- ing for the Web, Shockwave only supports Polygonal modeling, so it is essential that your character is either made this way, or converted to a polygonal mesh before animation.  Animating and exporting using  linked hierarchies To demonstrate a linked hierarchy that will export, let us return to the turtle of Chapter 1. He is fairly low in polygons, and needs only a simple change in mapping to work.  We  cannot  export  a  Bump  map,  so  I  have  created  a  new  bitmap   TIFF  image in a drawing program to give the turtle a texture. By importing that bitmap as a Diffuse map and mapping it to UVW Map  cid:2  Face, I have given the turtle an exportable shell texture  Figure 5.1 .  Figure 5.1 The new turtle shell with its bitmap  Check you have a camera set up and put the turtle in a start pose.  Note  You cannot export linked animation unless each individual component of your character is first grouped. Do this by selecting each mesh in turn and selecting ‘Group’ from the top menu bar. Nothing discernable hap- pens to your mesh, but you will need to re-label each body part, and it will  show  up  in  bold  type  when  selected,  and  with  square  brackets around it in the ‘Select by Name’ list  Figure 5.2 .  Before we animate we have to make sure that all the pivot points are in the correct place and that we have linked our turtle parts into an animatable   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 161  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  161  Figure 5.2 The Select Object box with each turtle part grouped  hierarchy. Move all the pivot points on the limbs, head and tail to a good position for rotation, i.e. where they meet the shell, and rotate the pivots to make the Y-axis run along the legs. Then use the Select and Link tool to link each limb and tail to the shell. Link the eyeballs and the tongue to the head, and link that to the shell too. Tick ‘Display Subtree’ in the ‘Select by Name’ list to check how it looks  Figure 5.3 .  Figure 5.3 The hierarchy with Display Subtree ticked   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 162  162  3D for the Web  Great, everything is now set up for animation. Try exporting the turtle now, just to check it looks ﬁne.  Make  sure  that  you  have  either  your  Camera  viewport  operative,  or  a Perspective  viewport.  Go  to  File  cid:2  Export  and  select  the  Shockwave  3D Scene Exporter, name your ﬁle and export your turtle as a .w3D ﬁle. Keep the Exporter options as the default and your turtle should appear in a win- dow. You should be able to move around the turtle to see it at any angle with the left mouse button depressed.  To exit this window you have to click on the Top right ‘X’ button. Another window will appear showing a pie chart  Figure 5.4 . This indicates what took the most time for the Exporter to compute. We have no animation as yet, so the biggest ﬁle size is the geometry of the turtle.  Figure 5.4 The Shockwave Exporter pie chart  Click  ‘OK’  and  another  window  will  crop  up.  This  is  entitled  ‘Possible Problems’ and is much scarier. But do not panic, this box is never empty. There will be a long list of Shaders saying that they will not be shaded the way they are in Max. However, because we have been careful with our shaders using only UVW bitmaps and Standard Blinn Shaders the Shockwave picture we received was a good approximation of the Max rendering  Figure 5.5 .

Set the Time-scale to 7 frames at 25 frames per second.  With the Time slider at 0 frames, click each object in turn and make a rota- tion Key with the positions at one extreme of the animation. Select ‘Local’ from the Reference Coordinate System  where it reads ‘View’, next to the Scale tool . These mean that the ‘Y’-axis will run along the feet as we have repositioned the pivot point.  Rotate the right front foot and the left back foot up, and left front foot and right back foot down. Rotate the head to the left and the tail to the right.

Your  turtle  should  be  waggling  along,  ready  for  manipulation  in Director. The turtle is about 1300 polygons, and because the animation is simple, it does not take long to export. But notice that still the vast majority of the pie chart is devoted to geometry. One thousand three hundred poly- gons is just about an acceptable amount for a main character on the Web, but the sort of count one should be aiming for, according to standards set by games companies is to try and keep the count below 1000 polygons. The major problem for the turtle is not just the polygon count, but also the number of separate meshes that make up the ﬁgure; this really slows down the Shockwave player. The two main ways of circumventing these problems are to create a single mesh character and use careful mapping to distin- guish the character.  Making a single mesh character A single mesh character is desirable for any interactivity. It speeds things up in Director and makes for fast animation. It is important to make every poly- gon count, so you must have a ﬁrm idea of what you intend to model before you start. Even if you do not draw it, keep reference material to hand and try to visualize the end result. I intend to make a Keystone Cop, as I think he will be fun to animate, and the helmet and moustache should give him a strong silhouette. Later in the book we will put him in our game chapter as the main character  Figure 5.7 .  We start with making a box in the Top viewport. The segments should be 3  cid:3  4  cid:3  3. Convert the box to an Editable Mesh. In the Top viewport select all the vertices to the right of the centerline and press ‘Delete’.  Select the remaining half and choose the Mirror tool from the main tool bar.  A pop-up box will appear called ‘Mirror Screen Coordinates’. The mirror   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 165  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  165  Figure 5.7 Reference drawing for the Keystone Cop  axis should be on X and you need to select ‘Instance’. You should see a mir- ror image of your object appear in the viewports. Click ‘OK’  Figure 5.8 .  Figure 5.8 The Mirror tool and Pop-up in 3D Studio Max  Click on your original object, to make it operative and the mirror object will now highlight. Because this mirrored object is an ‘Instance’, whatever we do to our original will be mirrored by the new object. Now we only have to build half a person!   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 166  166  3D for the Web  At Sub-Object level, select the polygon that is in the top-middle of the side of your half box. We will extrude this to make an arm.  You can use the Extrude intuitively by clicking and dragging on the slider or by typing in values. As you Extrude, notice that the mirrored object grows a symmetrical right arm to match what you do to the left. Using the Bevel tool in conjunction with Extrude, it is possible to create an arm shape.  Top Tip Because we are modeling with a view to animating our finished char- acter, it is always a good idea to create more detail where the joints will be, so Extrude just a bit twice at the shoulder, and then Extrude again to make the upper arm. It is hard to make a character deform properly  unless  there  are  extra  polygons  created  at  each  crease  for armpits, elbows, knees and thighs  Figure 5.9 .  Figure 5.9 Extruded arms and neck  When extruding the neck, be aware that you are creating extra polygons inside the neck. It will be necessary for us to delete these later, as we will want hollow shells like two halves of an Easter egg.  Adjust vertices to make a torso that suits the character by squeezing in a waist, for example. Try to keep the central vertices on a line so that the mir- rored object joins the object you are working on.  Still using the same tools  Extrude and Bevel  it is possible to create an entire body. Do not forget that you can angle the Polygons you Extrude using Rotate, and can Select and Move or Scale them if you wish without creating more polygons.  Remember to click on ‘Ignore Backfacing’ if you are selecting   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 167  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  167  vertices or polygons from the top or bottom, or you may end up creating a leg when you are working on the neck!   Model the arms down to the wrists, Extrude and Bevel inwards to push the selected polygons back to create sleeves. Then Non-Uniform Scale the poly- gons to ﬂatten them into the right proportions for a hand. Remember to add in some extra polygons so the mesh can tolerate deformation later. The hands are made like mittens with only one joint in the ﬁngers. Fingers use up a lot of polygons and one hand will be permanently welded to his truncheon anyway  Figure 5.10 .  Figure 5.10 The hand from the top view  Make feet with the ‘Extrude’, ‘Scale’ and ‘Bevel’. Pick the top polygon and extrude that to give him nice bulbous toecaps. Create a head from a sepa- rate box, with just two segments so that it will have the same number of ver- tices and will attach easily to the neck. It is easier to make a head whole rather than in two halves as it tends to have more features, but you could make it using the Mirror tool as you did the body.  The nose was made by choosing a single vertex on his face, and using the ‘Chamfer’  tool  to  create  an  extra  polygon.  Then  this  new  polygon  was selected and extruded  Figure 5.11 .  Now we will join both halves of the body together. Select the right half  either would do  and delete it. Examine this half and check you have a clean edge in the middle; any internal polygons in the middle must be eradicated.  You often make them at the crotch and neck, as you Extrude your original box. Delete them to make a clean edge.  Select your remaining half, and using the Mirror tool, this time create a Copy. It should look just like the Instance you have replaced, but will no longer be affected by what you do to the original mesh.   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 168  168  3D for the Web  Figure 5.11 Time to join everything up  Go to Sub-Object  cid:2  Vertex level on this new mesh, and click on the button ‘Attach’. It will turn yellow. Now click on your original half of the body. It will show its vertices too. Click off the ‘Attach’ button. Your body is now one object, but it is necessary to ‘sew-up’ the seam along its middle.  The easiest way to do this is to select each pair of vertices where they meet and click on the ‘Collapse’ button. This will collapse the selected vertices into one single vertex.  Be very careful you get all the vertices on the seam and  check  ‘Ignore  Backfacing’  to  avoid  stitching  your  character’s  belly  button to the small of his back.   Attach the head by the same method, making sure that you delete the poly- gons at the bottom of the head and the top of the neck to make a clean shell. I then added some ears and the moustache. The ears were made by extrud- ing and beveling a polygon on each side of the head, and the moustache by extruding, beveling and rotating the ‘nostril’ polygons  Figure 5.12 .   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 169  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  169  Figure 5.12 Ears and moustache  It  is  generally  acknowledged  that  square,  i.e.  four-sided  polygons  take deformation best. One should also try and make sure that there are no cor- ners in the mesh that do not lead to an Edge. There will be some areas in your Polygonal mesh where this occurs. In Figure 5.13 you can see that  Figure 5.13 A corner that does not lead to an Edge at the shoulder. Invisible Edge highlighted   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 170  170  3D for the Web  such a corner has occurred where the mesh has been pulled down at the back to create the shoulder line. It is still part of a four-sided polygon, but the polygon itself is a large ungainly shape that could be improved.  In Sub-Object  cid:2  Edge mode check for any areas that have such corners. The easiest way to rectify them is to ﬁnd the invisible Edge that runs diagonally through the polygon. Click on the polygon till you ﬁnd it, it will highlight as a red dotted line. If it does not travel to the corner, as in the illustration, it can be turned to run through the opposite diagonal. Click on the ‘Turn’ button, which will highlight as yellow, and click on the invisible Edge again. It will turn to the opposite diagonal, running to the corner. Now turn off the ‘Turn’ button by clicking it again  it is easy to forget to do this , scroll down the Edge menu and ﬁnd the ‘Visible’ and ‘Invisible’ buttons under Surface Properties. With the Edge still selected, click ‘Visible’. The Edge will become a white line.  Top Tip Visible Edges have the effect of ‘plumping out’ a mesh and it is often worthwhile to go over a newly built model paying some attention to the edges and turning some Invisible edges to Visible.  Now create a truncheon for his right hand by extruding polygons from his palm. This can be a bit ﬁddley, but try and be economical with those polygons.  Select all the polygons and see how many you have. My Keystone charac- ter ﬁnished at 990 faces, with a moustache and truncheon thrown in, so he should ﬁt sweetly into Shockwave. Finally use ‘Autosmooth’ on all the poly- gons  at  a  value  of  180  to  round  off  your  ﬁgure.  He  is  now  ready  for  mapping  Figure 5.14 .  Figure 5.14 The Keystone model before mapping. Total of 990 faces   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 171  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  171  UVW mapping I have read a lot of tutorials about UVW mapping and Unwrap UVW mapping in my time, and to be honest they are very hard to follow. This is complex stuff, and the tools  particularly the Unwrap UVW  are less than intuitive. So before we map the Keystone ﬁgure, I want to just take a bit of time to talk about map- ping in general. If you create a complex shape in a 3D program, UVW map- ping is the only way of getting a bitmap material positioned correctly. But the controls for how to ﬁt that bitmap are not good enough for complex shapes. Figure  5.15  shows  a  fairly  complex  shape,  to  which  I  have  applied  a Checkered  bitmap   tiled  10  times ,  using  a  Box  map.  It  does  not  look  so  bad,  but  the  checks  are  not  square,  which  would  mean  that  any  map would be stretched. This is because the default Box ﬁtting is to create a Gizmo that ﬁts the object, and the dimensions of the underlying mesh are not square. This is easily solved by typing in the bitmap dimensions you have chosen. In this case I have put in a value of 256 in all dimensions  Figure 5.16 .  Figure 5.15 Checkered bitmap. UVW Box mapping  Figure 5.16 Bit map size 256   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 172  172  3D for the Web  Figure  5.17 Checkered  bitmap.  UVW  Box  mapping,  before  resizing  the  Gizmo  Figure 5.18 Checkered bitmap. UVW Box mapping. 256 bitmap and resized Gizmo  Now I have entered in a measurement that is equal for all dimensions, the map looks like this, which is kind of psychedelic, because the Gizmo is now much  smaller  than  the  object,  so  the  checks  are  coming  out  very  small  Figure 5.17 .  The size of the checks can easily be changed by opening the UVW map- ping modiﬁer in the stack and resizing the Gizmo using the Uniform Scale. Now the checks are square, and the bitmap size is 256  Figure 5.18 .  A lot of tutorials suggest that Cylindrical mapping is the best. So let us see what our object looks like using a Cylindrical map  Figure 5.19 .   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 173  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  173  Figure 5.19 Checkered bitmap. UVW Cylindrical mapping  Whichever  way  round  I  turn  the  Gizmo  there  is  a  lot  of  distortion. Cylindrical  mapping  does  have  uses,  but  it  is  impossible  to  control  how square the map is except by eye. For this reason, and for this demonstra- tion, I have chosen to use Box mapping. Box mapping has its own inherent problems; the pattern appears on all sides of the ‘Box’ and so on all sides of  the  object  you  are  mapping.  This  was  the  problem  we  encountered  with  the  MacHead’s  package  in  Chapter  2.  We  got  around  it  there  by  using Mesh Select and UVW mapping different sides of the box with dif- ferent maps. We are going to do a similar thing with the Keystone ﬁgure, but  are  going  to  use  Multi Sub-Object  to  select  areas  for  mapping  and Unwrap  UVW  map  to  adjust  the  unwanted  mapping  around  the  back  and sides.  Material mapping the Keystone character To begin with, we will use a Multi Sub-Object Material. We need to desig- nate all the different areas that need mapping. I have seven Sub-Material slots chosen: uniform top, uniform trousers, boots, skin, helmet, moustache and truncheon. Select the relevant polygons for each area and give them a designated Material ID.  For example, all moustache polygons are given the Material ID of 3.  For demonstration purposes, Figure 5.20 shows how the Keystone looks with a checkered map.  Assign a UVW map modiﬁer to Your Editable Mesh ﬁgure, and type in 256 for the length, width and height. Re-adjust the Gizmo so that it approxi- mately  ﬁts  the  ﬁgure.   It  does  not  really  matter  as  we  will  be  ﬁne-tuning  this later.    Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 174  174  3D for the Web  Figure 5.20 Keystone with Checkered bitmap. UVW Planar mapping, UVW Box mapping and UVW Box mapping with 256 bitmap and resized Gizmo  Now we need to create some materials for the character. I have made all the materials in Photoshop at 256 pixels square. The helmet badge and but- tons were made in 3D, rendered and then incorporated into the designs in Photoshop. I have given the uniform a bit of texture to mimic cloth, added a shine highlight for the boots and drawn eyes for his face  Figure 5.21 .  Figure 5.21 Materials created for Keystone model at 256  cid:3  256 pixels   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 175  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  175  The  keystone  model  and  the  materials  are  on  the  CD  that  accompanies  the book.  Label and keep all these materials in a folder neatly, as if you ever transfer your 3D ﬁle to another machine, you need to take the maps with it so it can ﬁnd them and apply them.  Now let us bring the materials into the Material Editor. The easiest way to do this is to select a sample slot for each one and click on the tiny box next to the Diffuse Color  Figure 5.22 .  Figure 5.22 Bringing bitmaps into the Material Editor  This brings up the Material Map Browser and you can choose bitmap and browse for your materials. Click on the Show Map in viewport button for each slot, it will highlight when on  Figure 5.23 .  Figure 5.23 The Show Map in viewport button  The next thing to do is put all these Materials into the vacant Multi Sub- Object Material slots. Open the Multi Sub-Object Material slot you have assigned to the Keystone character and drag and drop the Materials into the Channels  Figure 5.24 .  The  materials  should  now  all  appear  on  your  model;  they  should  be assigned to the correct areas, but not ﬁtted at all. Frankly the ﬁgure probably looks a mess! But fear not, as now, by using the Unwrap UVW we will ﬁt each one snugly to our ﬁgure. Let us start with the helmet.   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 176  176  3D for the Web  Figure 5.24 All the Materials in Multi Sub-Object Material  The Unwrap UVW map modiﬁer Position the Gizmo for the UVW map on the helmet so that the badge is in a good position and size from the front  Figure 5.25 .  Looks great doesn’t it? But if we look at the back in Figure 5.26, it is a  different story.  Because we are using Box mapping, the badge is also appearing at the sides and back of the helmet. We need to get rid of these, and will do this using the Unwrap UVW modiﬁer. Add Unwrap UVW to the stack above UVW mapping and click on Edit under Parameters. One of the scariest win- dows you have ever seen will pop up – the Edit UVW window  Figure 5.27 .   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 177  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  177  Figure 5.25 The helmet badge ﬁtted from the front, using the UVW map Gizmo  Figure 5.26 The back view  You can zoom in and out using the middle mouse wheel, and might just be able to detect an approximation of what a wireframe of your model looks like when run over by a steamroller. Do not panic. This is the whole model, and for now we only want the helmet and the material we have chosen for it. At the Top right of the window is a material number  sometimes this is kind enough to call your materials by name, and sometimes it is not, do not ask me   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 178  178  3D for the Web  Figure 5.27 The Edit UVW window  why, it is a glitch  keep ﬂipping through these until you get your helmet material as a background. If it is not there  another glitch , you can use Pick Texture to bring your map into the window. It is identical to the one in the Material Editor. At the bottom of the window is a window that says ‘All IDs’ open this and choose the Multi Sub-Object Material slot ID for your helmet. In my case it is slot 2. A lot of white lines will disappear; we now are looking at only the hel- met UVW polygons. Again it might be almost identiﬁable  Figure 5.28 .   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 179  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  179  Figure 5.28 The Edit UVW window with only the helmet selected  ID 2   This window represents all the polygons of your helmet and which bit of the UVW map they have been assigned. It does not look too logical. If you were hoping your model would unfold like an Origami box, think again, sometimes it maps half a polygon in one place and the other face miles a way. But do not despair, once you get your head around it, UVW mapping is great, particularly for low-poly models, because it gives you total control of how each polygon is mapped. Click  on  ‘Options’  in  the  menu  bar  of  the  Edit  UVW  window,  choose ‘Advanced  Options’  and  tick  the  boxes  besides  ‘Constant  Update  In   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 180  180  3D for the Web  Viewports’ and ‘Highlight Selected Vertices’. This will make it a little easier for us to view the interaction between the polygons and vertices in the win- dow and those on our model  Figure 5.29 .  Figure 5.29 Advanced options in the Edit UVW window  Open out Unwrap UVW in the Modiﬁer stack and click on ‘Select Face’. Select a Polygon at the side of the helmet, where the badge is showing  and you do not want it . Now click on the triangular Face icon at the bottom of the Edit UVW window. You should now see just one polygon in the window. It  is  the  one  that  you  have  selected  and  you  can  see  which  part  of  the Material map it is picking up. Better yet, if you click off Select Face in the Modiﬁer stack, you can move this polygon in the Edit UVW window and see  what  is  happening  in  the  viewport.  You  move  the  whole  polygon around the map by making sure all four vertices are highlighted and using the Move icon in the center of the polygon. To Scale it you choose a Corner Vertex, and you rotate it from the middle of an edge.  You can also use the tools on the menu bar but then you have to position the mouse over a ver- tex to get control.   Figure 5.30   It is now an easy matter to move the polygon to a safe place on the map where there is no badge showing. Do this to all the polygons that are show- ing a badge apart from the front two.  You have to keep clicking back on to   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 181  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  181  Figure 5.30 One polygon selected in the Edit UVW window  Select Face, or the window will disappear and you have to open it up again with the Edit button in Parameters.  You can select as many faces as you want. Figure 5.31 shows the helmet completely mapped.  Once you have done the entire helmet and you are happy with it, Collapse the stack below the Unwrap UVW map back to an Editable Mesh to lock the UVW mapping. Do this by R-clicking on UVW map in the Modiﬁer stack and choosing ‘Collapse To’. You should now have an Editable Mesh below the Unwrap UVW in the Modiﬁer stack.  Now we are going to adjust each map to each part of the mesh, one at a time, just as we did the helmet. One of the great things about this is you can keep on making adjustments at any time, even if you Collapse the Stack down to Editable Mesh, and then ﬁnd you have missed a bit, or want to change anything, you can always add an Unwrap UVW map modiﬁer to the stack and move things around again. Also, because the maps are taken from  the  originals  as  Instances,  you  can  go  back  into  your  drawing  program and change them and they will automatically update.   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 182  182  3D for the Web  Figure 5.31 The helmet completely mapped  The hardest thing to ﬁt is the uniform. This is because it is relatively big and needs a lot of scaling down. You can do this easily by selecting all the ver- tices in the window and using the Scale tool  Figure 5.32 .  When you get used to the controls, it is fun to be able to play with the map- ping. The polygons at the hem of the uniform needed straightening out so that the hemline was even. This was achieved by selecting those polygons and moving the relevant vertices to the right place on the map. I also rotated the  polygons  on  the  moustache  individually  so  that  the  hair  growth  was always in the right direction. As you get more ﬂuent with the tools, a lot of possibilities  open  up  for  ﬁne  manipulation  of  how  a  material  can  be mapped  Figure 5.33 .

It was started by three friends: Andy, Jo and Martin.  Their  company  website,  where  a  robot  called  ‘sniff’  leads  the  viewer  to  different worlds was commended in the Big 3D Flash Web contest.   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 185  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  185  The animation of ‘sniff’ is a delight; these guys have an obvious love of good character animation. Their clever use of giving the viewer little movies to watch as the different segments download is a great example of how to overcome download issues with elegance.  Interview  How did you three get started in Web design? Andy: I started with my private page www.aliendy.de – as a kind of business card for me and my work. Later I made the design and the underwater photos for a diving website in Mexico: www.divetulum.com. We three were all 3D freelance artists and friends for a long time before setting up Electric Puppet. Jo: A friend who was a music composer and jazz musician needed a web- site including sound examples. I knew that Flash had the possibility to imple- ment sound and to ﬁx the look of the page, so I started to learn this program auto-didactically. Before I started working as 3D artist I studied architecture, so that gave me a good foundation for 3D. Martin: This site was my ﬁrst real experience with Web design and espe- cially with Flash, before this I only played around a little bit, but did not upload anything.  General design and 3D What do you think is the essence of good Web design? Andy: Clear design! The visitor has to be led by the designer. He should be able to ﬁnd the way easily to the important links  there can be also some ‘hidden’ links, but only for funny things . The design should look like it is made from one hand. Do not use too much text – nobody reads much text on the Web. I like it if you do not have too much information on one site. Jo: Be clear; promote play instinct and investigation. Give the visitor some- thing to remind them of you and try to make them want to come back again. Martin: First of all a website has to be functional, so the visitor can easily reach all the information that the site offers. The rules for graphic design are pretty much the same as in other media.  Why did you decide to use 3D in your web page? Andy: I have been working in 3D for 10 years now. For the last year I have been rendering 3D scenes in Flash ﬁles, so I got the idea to show my skills in a web page with a 3D character. Character animation is my favorite work! Jo:  Our  real  world,  the  world  we  are  used  to  seeing  is  in  3D,  and  the Internet is partly a copy of the ideas, news and products in our world. With   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 186  186  3D for the Web  a 3D web page you create a platform more accustomed for the human way of seeing things. Martin: My daily work is 3D – so, for me Flash was the new tool.  Who or what are your inspirations? Andy: Comics – for sure  Frank Miller! , I like the reduced design very much. But also the big movies, the effects give me a wonderful illusion! Jo: Most ideas come to me when I take a walk through nature letting my mind ﬂoat. Martin: Comics and cartoons. I like the cartoons because of the animation, e.g. the old version of Tom and Jerry or Tex Avery. Good comics are like ﬁlms – but not a ﬁnished ﬁlm, more like a storyboard, so there is more space for your own imagination. Films are also very impor- tant, e.g. the work of Pixar is always inspirational.  How did you come up with the idea for Electric Puppet site? Andy: I had the idea to animate a story with a 3D character a long time before it was possible to render it in Flash. But now I also had for the ﬁrst time  the  possibility  to  make  the  story  interactive  through  the  Internet!  I wanted to show my skills and put my knowledge into a little story. The visi- tor should be taken by our robot into different worlds – he is the actor, the visitor shows him the way. Somehow like a reduced version of a game. Jo: Andy and Martin told me about the idea of a self promoting website in 3D with a robot leading through the menus. Then we took a day, in the   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 187  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  187  green,  thinking  about  the  main  structure  of  the  page.  To  send  ‘sniff’  our robot on a journey to different worlds turned out to be the leading idea. This made it easy to split the work and to enlarge the web page in the future. Also a lot of ideas came up during the project.  Good-looking 3D has an immediate appeal. Do you see it as the way forward in Web design, or just another tool? Andy: Sure – you can use it just as a tool – but I think it opens up a new world of design to the visitor. I don’t want to say it is better, but that it is dif- ferent to the 2D-stuff. Jo: It offers another aspect to the observer. At the moment it is very interest- ing because of the lack of 3D web pages. 3D is fascinating to people, but it depends on what you do with it; just the fact you are using 3D doesn’t lead to a good web page.  Your past and future work What sort of clients would you like to attract? Andy: All companies, who need 3D or better 3D characters for their web page. 3D is for children as well as for adults. Jo:  People  who  need  3D  animation  and  special  fx  for  ﬁlm,  television  or Internet. This can range from company or product presentations, feature ﬁlm to architectural visualizations and interactive buildings. Martin: Anyone who needs animation and effects. It does not matter, if it’s for the Web, television or cinema …   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:15  Page 188  188  3D for the Web  Any special future projects using 3D? Andy: We would like to continue our page with more worlds … we already have some ideas, also for a little game with our Electric Puppet robot ‘sniff’. Jo: Expanding the possibility of 3D usage and interactivity in the Web. Martin: Right now you can visit four worlds with the robot ‘sniff’. We had some ideas for other worlds, that we could not build, because of the dead- line  of  the  contest,  but  they  will  come.  A  Web  game  is  also  planned.  It would also be interesting to build a complete new character. So there are a lot of things to do.  Technique What software did you use for creating the website? Andy: Softimage XSI, Flash 5 and Adobe PhotoShop. How  much  programming action  scripting  do  you  use  in  creating  your  website? Jo: To combine all the animations and interactivity programming is inalien- able. So there is also a lot of programming to do. Martin: All interactive layers are scripted, the rest are background layers, sometimes with scrolling. So, it’s more like a jump- and run-game on C64.  Were there any speciﬁc problems you had to overcome? Jo: One of the biggest problems was to get the control over the animation loops in the right time, for Flash programming you sometimes have to think around the corner. Martin: We had to cut down our ideas, to keep the download time low.  Why did you use Flash for your website? Andy: For me it’s the most powerful tool for bringing 3D to the Web. Jo: As I worked on web pages with Flash earlier I was already familiar with the usage of Flash. This helped a lot for the programming of the page. Martin: Flash is a very powerful and quite easy tool. It offers a lot of pro- gramming tools and it was the best way to compose all the elements from the swift rendering. Additionally, most people have the Flash player on their computer. So they do not have to download a plug-in before they can visit the site.  Do you use any special plug-in for rendering your 3D animation in? Martin: All 3D elements are rendered with the Swift plug-in for XSI. It is still not perfect but the best thing right now to connect the two worlds.   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:16  Page 189  Chapter 5 – Making characters for Shockwave  189  Insights Do you have any advice for students of 3D Web design? Andy: Don’t spend too much time on super-special-effects. Solid animation is a basic requirement. Try to lead the visitor with your animation. A clear design is better than the most overﬁlled-websites are showing us – more is not always better. Compositing skills are also very important – you can only make good  and for Internet: small  scenes, if you know, which layers you need only one time  backgrounds  and what you need in the foreground more often. Flash is, in a totally 3D page, only the compositing tool. Jo: Don’t care too much about what tool you use, tools change. Keep look- ing around other web pages and try to ﬁnd what you like about them and what not. In 3D Web design many things work together and only in combi- nation can they create a good web page. Therefore, it is a good idea to ﬁnd friends to help you to achieve the aim together.  Broadband and the future: will size always matter? Andy: Size never matters  Godzilla showed us the truth, no?  Jo: One limitation is the ﬁle size. Our contribution has a total ﬁle size of 7.6 megabytes and it takes about 19 minutes with a 56 kilobytes modem to download  it  completely.  That  is  hard  at  the  limit.  But  we  divided  it  into smaller  pieces  and  give  the  visitor  something  to  look  at  during  loading times. Broadband will give us more liberty to use animation on the Web. But   Chap-05.qxd  8 12 04  15:16  Page 190  190  3D for the Web  you still have to keep in mind that not everybody in the world has a fast Internet connection or the right plug-in. So it is a good concept to offer more ways to get the information. Martin: It will always matter, because when the download time decreases, the ﬁle size will increase. I think you will always wait too long.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 191  Chapter 6 Animating for 3D interactivity  Chapter Summary    A live-action movie   Biped   Using Physique to attach your mesh   Animating the Biped for a game   The waiting game   Walk cycles   Exporting our character   Importing into Director   Adding a camera   Interview with Titoonic  A live-action movie This chapter is about taking your character model and animating him or her for use in an interactive 3D world. Its main use is for computer games, but it could equally be used for a character on a website that is interactive and responds to the user’s actions. Where this differs from the earlier chapters is that we will be creating it for use in Shockwave 3D. Macromedia Director’s Shockwave 3D allows the creation of virtual worlds and all the interaction and motion, which is implicated by that. Director has had 3D capabilities for a few years, but it is only recently proving to be popular. The main issue is that not enough developers know how to harness its power. This chapter will get you well under way, and the following two chapters will put you in a strong posi- tion to create your own real time 3D interactive content and games.  First of all we will animate our character, and then we will import him into Director applying pre-written behaviors that will allow you to control him in   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 192  192  3D for the Web  a simple world. In a sense, you will be creating a live-action movie, where you are the camera operator and Director of the action.  Biped The simplest way to deform a single mesh character built-in 3D Studio Max is by using ‘Biped’ in the Character Studio Plug-in. Biped is a sophisticated animation controller that gives us a ready made bone structure. We can fit a Biped to our model and use ‘Physique’ to attach the mesh. There are sev- eral  advantages  of  this  over  using  bones  when  it  comes  to  Shockwave Export, but the main ones are these:    Biped enables you to save any animation as a .bip file. This means you could create a dance sequence for say a Biped fitted to ballerina mesh, and transfer that data to any other Biped like one fitted to a hippo or a baby mesh. This ability to separate the animation from the character is a fantastic tool for anyone animating for Director, as it enables the Exporter to stream the mesh and animation separately.    Physique is far easier to fit and lock down than the Skin modifier.  The  Skin modifier does not export in all versions of 3D Studio Max.     Bipeds are very easy to set up, with their own built-in Inverse Kinematics  IK . The joints have built-in constraints so knees bend, but cannot twist. They also cannot bend the wrong way. This means there is no chance of suffering bones’ dreaded gimbal lock.    Biped has a built-in footsteps creator for animators that are new to ani- mating. This means you can throw down footsteps like choreographed dance steps for your character to stick to. It is also a superb way of deal- ing with motion capture data, allowing you to lock feet to the ground and not slide.    Although Biped delivers a humanoid skeleton, it is more adaptable than you might think. There are options for how many fingers and toes, and how many joints they have, and whether your character needs a tail or a ponytail. The Biped can be adapted to make four-legged creatures too, so  it  can  be  adapted  to  animate  most  things   apart  from  jellyfish  and multi-legged insects .  To create a Biped, click on the Systems panel  cid:2  Biped; the button will turn yellow  Figure 6.1 .  Click and drag in the front viewport to make a box roughly the same height as your mesh. On release you will find the full Biped skeleton.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 193  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  193  Figure 6.1 Creating a Biped  Top Tip Remember to click the Biped button off after creation. It is very easy to start  clicking  away  at  your  Biped  immediately,  accidentally  creating little Bipeds, which may be invisible in your scene. These will slow your workstation to a standstill and confuse you later.  A default biped is shown in Figure 6.2, we will now modify it to fit our model. Your Biped will be called Bip01, and will have a structural list below  Figure 6.2 The default Biped   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 194  194  3D for the Web  the Root name. With the Biped root still selected, click on the ‘Motion’ panel button. This is where you will find all the controls for your Biped.  Note  Biped controls only appear in the Motion panel if a part of the biped is selected in the viewports.  Click on the little chap that means ‘Figure mode’. You must be in Figure mode for fitting the Biped to your mesh  Figure 6.3 .  Figure 6.3 Figure mode in Biped  Open the Structure rollout and use the sliders to change the settings to fit the Keystone character. He only needs two fingers with two links, and one toe with one link. Two Spine links is enough, and very importantly, two pony- tails with two links each. These will serve to animate his moustache.  Freeze  your  mesh  by  selecting  it,  R-clicking  in  a  viewport  and  selecting Freeze Selection. This stops you accidentally picking it up when you are fitting the Biped. Stay in Figure mode and position your Biped inside the mesh. Start with aligning the hips, i.e. the pelvis and the Center of Mass which looks like a small blue diamond in the pelvis. The Center of Mass is the whole body controller and root of the Biped. Position the Center of Mass low in the hips of your figure and then start fitting everything else. You can use  Non-Uniform  Scale  to  adjust  the  size  and  length  of  the  bones,  and rotate the bones to follow your mesh  Figure 6.4 .   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 195  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  195  Figure 6.4 The Keystone character with a fitted Biped  Top Tip The closer you Biped fits your figure, the easier it will be to fit to the mesh. It will also be a lot easier to animate, if the Biped mass approx- imates the mass of your character. Time spent here will save you  time later.  It is important that the Biped joints align with the joints you have created at the arms and legs in your mesh. Also pay particular attention to where they meet the torso.  There are two buttons that are of great help in making sure that the left and right sides of your Biped match; they are the opposite and symmetrical but- tons in Track Selection. If you choose the left foot and click on symmetrical, you will also have selected the right foot. Because we built our Keystone   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 196  196  3D for the Web  character symmetrically, this means you can fit the Biped on one side and the other side will also fit  Figure 6.5 .  Figure 6.5 The body  Center of Mass  controllers and the opposite and symmetri- cal buttons in Biped  Make sure the soles of the Biped’s feet align with the soles of your mesh and make the Head bigger than the Keystone’s whole head and helmet. This means it will be easy to select when animating. Move the Ponytail Links in Biped to a suitable place for the moustache  Figure 6.6 . Although they are called ‘ponytails’, they can be positioned anywhere on the head and prove very useful for lots of secondary animation.  Ears, quiffs, etc.   Figure 6.6 Fitted ponytail links for animating the moustache  Fit the hands in the top viewport. You can position the fingers just as you did the ponytails. Align the left thumb with the mesh and scale the other finger into a large block to act for all the fingers.  Because the Keystone mesh is effec- tively wearing mittens.  On the right hand, use one finger to be the front of the   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 197  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  197  truncheon, and one to be the back. Keep the link halfway down the trun- cheon, as we can use it to bend the truncheon when animating  Figure 6.7 .  Figure 6.7 Fitted Biped hands and fingers  Check the fitting in all viewports, and when you are happy, unfreeze the mesh.  Using Physique to attach your mesh Add  a  Physique  modifier  to  your  Keystone  Editable  Mesh.  Click  on  the Attach to Node button  it looks like a little man with a target at his hip  and select your Biped, Bip01 from the Select by Name List  Figure 6.8 .  Figure 6.8 The attach to Node button   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 198  198  3D for the Web  The Physique Initialization box will appear, Click Initialize, and the Physique modifier is applied with the default Envelopes that will control your mesh.  Note  This would also work for a series of different meshes. A character can be  made  of  segments  and  you  can  still  use  the  Physique  modifier. When it comes to Initialization the same rules apply for each segment. Do not attach the head mesh to the Bip01 Head, and the mesh’s R-foot to the Bip01 R-foot, etc. as there should be only one Root Node for your character.  Now comes the fun bit, making sure that your Biped and mesh are a per- fect fit. Many people have a lot of problems with this, but actually it is very easy if you do it the old-fashioned way – by vertex.  The Physique modifier has a rollout that lists five sub-selections: Envelope, Link, Bulge, Tendons and Vertex. Because you have fitted your Biped skeleton well, the default Envelopes should already be in good shape. In Wireframe View, Select Envelope and click on a link such as the Bip01 Upper Arm. You will observe two envelopes controlled by that link: an inner, red one and an outer purple one.  The envelopes in ‘Physique’ work much as the envelopes do in ‘Skin’ modi- fier described in Chapter 4. Any vertices that lie within the inner, red enve- lope will be 100% controlled by that link, the outer purple envelope denotes a level of influence that falls away to nothing. Click on few more links and you will observe that the purple envelopes overlap; this allows the Physique modifier to share the influence of the links in the skeleton to achieve smooth deformation. Thus the Bicep is typically controlled by one link, the Forearm by another and the elbow has a shared influence between the two links.  Because our mesh is very simple, we do not have any need to think about Bulges  and  Tendons,  these  are  ways  of  distributing  a  link’s  influence  to  simulate actual flesh.   Now go into Sub-Object  cid:2  Vertex mode. Click on ‘Select’  it will highlight in yellow  and marquee-select all the vertices in your figure. Most of them will light up as either red or dark red. A few may light up as blue  Figure 6.9 . Red vertices are within an inner envelope, dark red are in an outer envelope, i.e. have more than one link influencing them and blue vertices are unattached. If you were to animate your character now, the vertices col- ored blue would be left behind.  Zoom in on your figure and check for blue vertices, if there is one, select it and click on ‘Assign to Link’. Click on the link you wish the vertex to attach to, and it will turn red. Do this for any blue vertices you have, if you have fitted the Biped skeleton well, you really should have very few or none at all.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 199  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  199  Figure 6.9 Selecting all the vertices in Physique’s Vertex Sub-Object mode  Now all the vertices are attached, you may want to fine-tune their adjust- ments, or your character may be working just fine already! To test how the mesh is deforming under the Biped’s influence, we will put him through his paces by throwing down some footsteps. This only means pressing three buttons!  This is simply a test for how the mesh works we will deal with ani- mating the Biped properly in the next chapter. Another way of testing would   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 200  200  3D for the Web  be to load an animated BIP file from the Character Studio Plug-in and see how the character responds.   Select part of your Biped and open the Motion panel. Click out of Figure mode, by clicking on Footstep Mode next to it. The two Footprints will high- light in yellow  Figure 6.10 .  Figure 6.10 Creating Multiple Footsteps for a Biped  Under Footstep Creation, click on Create Multiple Footsteps and ‘OK’ on the pop-up menu for a default four steps. You will see some white footprints appear before your character. The icon for Create Keys for Inactive Footsteps will light up in Footstep Operations. Click on it. Your Biped will jump to   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 201  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  201  attention. Play the animation and he will walk. He will walk like Frankenstein’s monster, or Arnie in Terminator One, but he will walk! To see how the mesh is really behaving click off the Object icon in the Display rollout below, this hides the Biped and allows you to view your mesh cleanly.  Your mesh may look marvelous, or you may see some strange anomalies in it. These are easily adjustable, and can be done with your Biped in any position; you do not have to return to Figure mode to sort him out, but you may prefer to, as this is a good ‘splayed’ position for selecting vertices.  Suppose when your Keystone walks, the Biped left thigh link is influencing vertices on the right thigh. This will result in an unhappy mesh deformation. To fix it, select your mesh and return to Physique’s Vertex Sub-Object Mode. Click on ‘Select by Link’, and choose Bip01 L Thigh, all the vertices influ- enced by this link will be selected, if there are any in the right leg, click on ‘Select’ and select these, then click on ‘Remove from Link’ and click on the Bip01 L Thigh Link again. It will look like nothing is happening, but if you choose ‘Select by Link’ again and choose Bip01 L Thigh, you will see that these vertices are no longer being picked up by that link.  Go over your mesh in Vertex Sub-Object Mode checking each link for such anomalies. When you are happy with everything, select all the vertices and click on ‘Lock Assignments’. Your Biped will now deform the Keystone mesh, and even better, any animation will Export beautifully to Shockwave, so long as you remember to ‘Group’ everything.  Animating the Biped for a game Now your Biped is looking good, it is time to decide what your character will need to do in your game. Almost inevitably you will need your character to get about, and that probably means walking or running  although obviously if your character is a kangaroo or a skateboarder you would be aiming to move them in a different way . Your character will also spend some time wait- ing,  while  the  person  controlling  it  gives  thought  to  their  next  move.  It  is always helpful to create at least one or more ‘waiting’ actions to give your character life. In real life no one stands totally still unless they are a mime statue or a shop window dummy, and we want the player to identify with your character, not admire it from a distance. In addition, your character will need to perform any other actions that would suit your game. In the case of the Keystone, I have also created a bashing motion and a jumping motion.  The waiting game Waiting actions are an opportunity for the animator to add personality to their character and if you look at any character-led games you will often be   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 202  202  3D for the Web  rewarded with some great animation, simply by doing nothing. If you wait too long with Rayman he takes off his head and bounces it like a basketball, and Mario falls into an exaggerated slumber. Waiting motions work best if you choose motions that seem appropriate for the character’s personality.  There are two ‘waiting’ modes for the Keystone. First he looks around, and second he taps his truncheon in his left hand. These fit his ever vigilant, briskly officious personality.  Before you begin animating your Biped, either Hide or Freeze the deforming mesh, so you cannot accidentally pick it up when choosing joints to ani- mate. The Biped looks pretty ugly, but you have to keep remembering that you are animating for your character, and not for the Biped  Figure 6.11 . The proportions of a well-fitted Biped should help, but sometimes moving one of these clodhoppers around to create movement for a delicate ethereal character  is  hard  to  imagine.   Character  Studio  4  has  some  alternative looks for the Biped, but whichever way you slice it, they all look like they have fought the ugly stick and lost.   Figure 6.11 The Keystone Biped, he may be an ugly critter, but he is ready to  animate  Animating using IK  Character Studio’s Biped has built-in IK solvers. This means that the charac- ter’s hands and feet can be moved and locked down and the biped will   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 203  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  203  solve how the other joints should rotate realistically. Whenever you rotate a joint, you are using Forward Kinematics, whenever you select and ‘Move’ a  hand  or  foot,  you  are  using  IK   Inverse  Kinematics .  This  might  sound frightening, but is in fact fairly intuitive to the animator.  Set  your  timeline  to  an  appropriate  length  and  PAL  format.  Click  out  of Figure mode, and at frame 0, put your character in a natural pose by select- ing each body part in turn and creating a key using either Set Key button in the  Motion  panel  rollout.  The  Biped  will  automatically  start  setting  these keys in Freeform Mode  Figure 6.12 .  Figure 6.12 The Motion Biped rollout panels   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 204  204  3D for the Web  Save  your  file  and  keep  this  clean  version  of  your  character  to  load  up before you start animating. We want to loop most of these actions, and keeping a set of clean keys at the beginning means we can copy these to the end to make sure the character loops properly.  When animating your character, first decide whether the feet are going to move. In this case, they are going to remain still, so I have locked them down using the Set Planted Key in the IK Info Panel.  Try to avoid using the ‘Anchor Keys’, the graphic is misleading as they only fix a hand or foot  temporarily and do not change the IK blend.   Top Tip Unless  you  have  Set  Keys  for  your  character’s  feet  using  the  Set Planted  Key  in  the  IK  Info  Panel,  you  will  not  be  able  to  convert  to Footstep  Mode   it  will  be  grayed  out .  But  if  you  have  used  the  Set Planted Keys then the IK blend will have a value of 1.0 and when you convert  modes,  a  footstep  will  be  created  at  every  Planted  Key.  You can convert back and forth from Footstep to Freeform Mode as often as you like.  If you select the Body Vertical button under Track Selection, you will see that if you pull your character down, it will now bend from the knees and keep its feet in place. Having sorted out the feet, always try and animate from  the Hips traveling upwards. All joints in the Biped body are moved with Rotation tool, apart from the hands which are moved with the Select and Move tool, allowing the IK to sort out the rest of the arm joints.  Note  The  fact  that  IK  will  solve  hand  and  foot  motions  for  the  rest  of  the joints is a wonderful thing, but do try and remember to keep the char- acter’s body moving in arcs. Nothing looks as stilted and wooden as hands moving in only one plane. All body movement is created by our bones moving in arcs. Even a simple head turn should have a dip or rise in the middle of the movement.  Be prepared to take some time on the animation, and try to spread any movements as far as they can go to bring an air of fluidity and naturalness to the motion. For instance, although the Keystone character is tapping his truncheon in his hand, I have spread the movement to his knees to make the motion livelier. The best way to animate is to act out the action again and again, isolating each part of your body as you do, and translating that to the character.  When you are happy with the motion, copy each Key from the beginning of your animation to the end, to create a seamless loop in the action. Check   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 205  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  205  it is not jumping by playing the animation in a loop and examining it from all sides in the perspective window.  Top Tip Always  check  your  animation  from  every  angle;  it  is  all  too  easy  to create a walk in a side view, only to find it is disastrous when viewed from the front.  Now unhide  or unfreeze  your mesh, and hide the Biped by clicking off ‘Objects’ in the Display panel. Play your animation again and enjoy your character  coming  to  life.  When  you  are  entirely  happy  with  the  motion, bring back the Biped and save the motion as a .bip file. This means that you have  the  capability  of  applying  that  motion  to  a  different  character  and allowing you to tweak it for individuality.  Group the Biped with the mesh, name the group  and make sure you name the group consistently for all animations  and export using Shockwave.  Walk cycles The walk cycle for your character is a critical piece of animation as any player will be seeing a lot of it, and it is really a very short piece of looped action  so  every  key  must  count.  The  walk  cycle  I  have  created  for  the Keystone is only 19 frames long at 25 frames per seconds  fps . An average walking pace is usually 12 frames long, or a second for one looped cycle, so the Keystone is walking rather more briskly than most, which is in keep- ing with his character. He is also looking around a bit as he is ever vigilant for things to bash.  Because we are going to loop the animation and the feet will have to slide back to their starting position, we will be working in ‘Freeform’ animation. Always start a walk cycle from the midpoint of a pace  called the passing position  where one foot is firmly planted, and the other is halfway through its pace. This is where the body is at its greatest height, and the hands are passing mid-cycle.  I recommend that you look up in a good animation book how a standard walk cycle should be animated and then add variations that give it extra character, such as Mickey Mouse’s double-bounce walk.  There are a num- ber recommended at the end of the book.  Do not forget that the hips and shoulders also swing from the front view – the hips following the leading leg and the shoulders tilting the other way to compensate  Figure 6.13 .   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 206  206  3D for the Web  Figure 6.13 Frames from the Biped 19 frame walk cycle  Getting a smooth slide into the feet is difficult. It goes against the grain for an animator to make the feet slide on purpose; we spend most of our time making certain that they are locked down tight. One way that works is to create two Dummies  one for each foot , and have them slide against the grid in the side viewport so they are even, then make the feet follow. Thus in this walk cycle the left foot Dummy travels back for six frames and six grid squares from the starting point  it is halfway through the pace, remember , and right foot Dummy travels back for 12 frames across 12 grid frames. This allows you to position the feet to follow the Dummies without making a keyframe  on  every  frame.  When  you  are  happy  the  animation  is  going smoothly, you can delete the Dummy helpers.  Note that you do not link the Biped feet in any way to the Dummies, as your Biped needs to be in world space to export to Shockwave.   You can view and dissect the finished walk cycle as a Max file on the CD along with the other animations for the Keystone character.  Exporting our character Building a simple world  Now  the  animation  is  complete  we  need  to  export  our  character  into Director. Before we do this, we should give him a ground to stand on. The simple way to do this will be to create a plane in the top view that is big enough for our character to walk around on. The ground plane is there to give the character a sense of scale and position. Without it he may as well be floating or treading water. As our character should be about 170 units   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 207  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  207  tall we need to make our ground plane an appropriate size; 25,000 by 25,000 units should be sufficient, we are only making it for demonstration purposes  Chapter 7 is where we will be investigating world creation in detail . Make sure you name the plane clearly, e.g. ‘ground’. Otherwise it will have default name like Plane01, which could be confusing if there are many other planes in your scene.  Once you have created our ground plane, we might as well give it a tex- ture. You could choose one of the standard materials, bearing in mind that they do not all export well  see Chapter 3 . Perhaps create a grass material from a photo, or a concrete one. It is best to make your texture a tiling one. The size of the bitmap used is very important and there are restrictions, so generally tiling is the best solution. Apply a UVW map modifier and change the U and V tiling settings to 20. This is how many times the image will repeat. If your material looks too repetitive then decrease the tiling value, until you are happy with it  Figure 6.14 .  Figure 6.14 UVW mapping settings for a simple ground plane   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 208  208  3D for the Web  Note  There is no need to tile in the W direction as the plane is only a 2D shape. In fact, most materials only map in two dimensions, even if they wrap around a 3D object. Some materials, e.g. the Wood material, are 3D. They give you the ability to take chunks out of an object and see how the grain looks inside. The other materials are in effect ‘skins’ that are stretched over an object.  If you want, you can add some other objects to your scene to help improve the sense of motion, when he is walking about. The character will not collide into these though, he will walk straight through them. Collision is something we will deal with in Chapter 8, where we will be assembling a game. For now we are just making our character controllable in real time, using the keyboard.  Creating a control box  You have already grouped your character and he has his animation setup. Make a note of the name of the group, in our case ‘Keystone’. This will be the name of the model that we are looking to animate in Director. The next thing to do will be to create a control box, this acts like the Master Dummy used in 3ds max for the eyes, and will be the object that is actually moved. Create a normal box shape starting in the top view that fits the shape and size  of  our  character  and  in  the  same  position.  He  will  turn  around  the  center point of this box, so make sure its center lines up with the character’s center axis.  It is essential that you create the control box in the top view, looking down on the character. This ensures that the axes match with the axes expected by the Director file, which you will be using. If you make this box differently then the character will not walk and turn correctly. This is a compromise solution, allowing you to control a character without you having to do any programming  Figure 6.15 .  Figure 6.15 The ‘Link’ and ‘Unlink’ buttons in the main tool bar  Create  a  material  that  has  zero  opacity  and  apply  it  to  the  box.  Link  the ‘Keystone’  group  to  this  box.  Press  the  Link  tool,  selecting  your  ‘Keystone’ group and dragging the mouse over the edge of the box. Releasing the mouse button here will briefly highlight the box, indicating that it has been linked.  The purpose of the control box is twofold. The first reason is to provide a  stable object that we can move around. As our character walks he moves from   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 209  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  209  side to side, and the rotation of his axes change. This means that when we move him  using Director’s Translate command  he would move in a wobbly manner. We want him to move in straight lines, and to turn correctly. In effect he does not walk anywhere, but will stay in treadmill mode, whilst it is the box that he is in that is moved around the environment. This may seem a bit awkward, but it works and the control box has another useful purpose; for collision detection. We will talk about this in Chapter 8, but in essence, the simpler the object that you are testing collisions for, the simpler the cal- culation is to do this. We always need to be aware of the frame rate so any- thing we can do to improve time is worthwhile. When creating a game, as we will later, it is not just the character we have to take into consideration, but every computationally expensive element  like collisions, other object movements, scoring system, etc. . As we do not want to see the box, we have made it transparent, but it will export correctly  Figure 6.16 .  Figure  6.16 The  box  surrounding  the  Keystone  character,  with  zero  opacity shown in the Materials window   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 210  210  3D for the Web  Although you will have created several files for your animation, you only need to put the box on to one of them. This is the file that you will use for all your environment modeling, the other files are only needed for the anima- tion information.  Exporting from your 3D package  You should have five 3D files, a ‘master’ file, which will be your 3D world, con- taining your character, control box and any other objects that you have cre- ated  e.g. ground plane . The other four files need only contain the character. Open the ‘master’ file and make sure the perspective viewport is selected. Go to File  cid:2  Export and choose Shockwave 3D  .w3d . For this file you need to export all the 3D resources  including animation . However, you only need to set the range to start and end to frame 0. This way the bone structure and mesh deformation information is exported but not the actual animation  Figure 6.17 .  Figure  6.17 The  Shockwave  3D  Export  window,  with  settings  for  exporting  a  still scene   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 211  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  211  If  you  have  selected  the  ‘View  w3D  scene  after  export’  option  you  will  be  able  to  preview  your  character.  When  you  are  happy  that  it  has exported correctly you can open one of the files that you have used for  your  animation.  Once  again,  make  sure  the  perspective  viewport  is selected before exporting. This is good practice and stops an Orthographic camera being used. In the Export Options window, you can deselect all  the resources except for the animations. Make sure the animation range  is  set  to  last  as  long  as  your  animation  and  keep  the  sampling  inter- val  at  1  and  the  animation  quality  at  100.0.  Ideally  you  do  not  want  your  animations  to  be  compressed,  unless  they  were  really  large  files   Figure 6.18 .  Figure 6.18 The Shockwave 3D Export window, with settings for exporting just the animation   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 212  212  3D for the Web  Make  sure  you  give  your  .w3d  files  clearly  understandable  names  like ‘walk motion’ or ‘standing motion’. You do not want to get confused later by trying to remember what file does what motion. There will be nothing to pre- view when you export just the animation, only the background color will be visible.  This  is  perfectly  fine  and  should  not  worry  you.  Looking  at  the exporter’s report will show you a file size indicated for animation, probably around 8 kilobytes in size. This means the animation data has exported and you can confidently repeat the process with the other motion files. If the size is zero then something has gone wrong. Make sure you did choose ‘Export selected’ and that you have selected the correct options in the export window.  Importing into Director That should be it for now in your 3D package, but if your computer has enough memory, keep it loaded and load up Director. It can be quite handy to have these two programs open at once, in order to quickly alter your scene, but if your computer slows down too much then quit your 3D application.  From the 3D for the Web disk open up the tutorial file ‘ControlCharacter.dir’ in Chapter 6 folder. This is a nearly blank Director file. It contains just three behaviors, which will enable you to move your character around the simple world that you have created and view it.  Stage 1 – Looping the Director movie  If you have been working through this book chapter by chapter, then it has probably been a while since you have used Director. It is good practice to make sure the playhead of the movie loops around one frame. To do this first open up the Score and the Cast windows from the Window menu. Then select the ‘Loop Frame’ behavior from the cast and drag it into the frame script window  above the timeline bar and next to the Script icon  and in frame position one. It should only be one frame in length  Figure 6.19 .  Stage 2 – Setting up the Shockwave 3D files  Now go to the File  cid:2  Import menu and import all five of your W3D files  the scene and the four motion files . You should see that the main file has a small  image  of  your  ground  and  character,  whereas  the  other  four  are blank. Open up the Stage window from the Window menu and drag your scene file  in our case it is called Keystone  onto the Stage. Make sure your movie is at a suitable size, Window  cid:2  Property Inspector  cid:2  Movie. I suggest   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 213  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  213  Figure 6.19 Director’s Score and Cast windows, showing the position of the Loop Frame behavior  you set it to 640 by 480 for now, as we will not be exporting it for the  Web as yet. Stretch your 3D sprite on the Stage to fill the whole window  Figure 6.20 .  Check the Score window, you should see the 3D sprite in Sprite Channel 1. It will probably be more than one frame long but this will not matter as the playhead will loop around only frame one.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 214  214  3D for the Web  Figure 6.20 Resizing the 3D sprite to fill the Stage window  Applying the Character Control behavior  If you play your movie at this stage, nothing will happen, as we need to use the Character Control behavior that I have made up for you to use. There is a lot of programming in this behavior but you should not have to worry about it. I have incorporated a degree of customization, giving you options to select, which will be explained in a moment. There are always pros and cons in creating a standard, one size fits all, piece of code. They are fairly easy to use, but troubleshooting can be awkward if there are problems. If you  are  familiar  with  Lingo  coding  then  you  are  welcome  to  adapt  this behavior  for  your  own  uses.  In  essence  it  is  a  part  of  a  block-by-block method for creating a game. This will be achieved in Chapter 8, but for now we will get on with just controlling our character. Drag the Control Character behavior from the Cast to the Stage window and drop it on our 3D scene sprite. A pop-up window should appear with many options  Figure 6.21 .   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 215  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  215  Figure 6.21 The Parameters pop-up window for the Control Character behavior  Select the control box object as the object that you want to control. You should have linked the character to this object, so moving it around means that the character follows it. In other words the character actually stays on the spot and it is the box that moves around.  The character to animate will be our Keystone group that you should have already named. This selection affects the motion settings later on, as the behavior looks for motions that have the same name as the animated char- acter. I should point out that if you select the wrong object, playing your movie will cause an error. The object you select must be the one you ani- mated previously. If you get an error, then cancel it and go to the Behavior Inspector, then select the correct object to animate.  Choosing the ground object is important as this dictates the vertical position of our character. As he jumps up, the behavior checks for the objects that   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 216  216  3D for the Web  are below and makes sure that the control box object does not fall down below the ground object. This works even for bumpy terrains  these are dis- cussed in the next chapter . There is a gravity value that forces the charac- ter to stick to the ground.  The walking speed is adjustable so that you can closely match the speed of his her  footsteps  with  the  distance  that  the  control  box  is  moved  every frame. This figure is in world units and defaults to a value that will be roughly right. If your character appears to be sliding on the ground then you can change this value later, by selecting the behavior in the Behavior Inspector.  The next four options allow you to choose the motions that you should have set up and imported already. These motions have been set up to be trig- gered by pressing the appropriate keys. When you select the forward key, not only does the control box move forward, the walk motion animation is told to start playing and to loop. This will continue until the key is released. Then the previous animation will play. The previous animation is the stand- ing motion that also loops, but works only when a key is not pressed. When you press the ‘walk backwards’ key, then the animation is told to play in reverse.  Animation blending  A good thing about Director is that these animations do not just stop and start they blend smoothly from one to the other, known as animation blend- ing. This is a very useful feature, as it will make our character look a lot more believable than if there was an abrupt, unnatural change between the two  motions.  Blending  also  happens  when  the  bash  motion  is  played, whereupon the control box is told not to move forward.  The main advantage of blending is that you may have a motion that finishes in a slightly different body motion to the next motion’s start position, but it will not be noticeable. Also a motion does not have to be finished playing for it to blend into the next motion. So you can quickly and smoothly change between bashing, jumping and walking  Figure 6.22 .  Note  Animation blending does not occur at the point where a looped ani- mation jumps back to the beginning. It only occurs between two dif- ferent motions. This means that any looped animations you create in your 3D application must repeat smoothly. You may have done this by careful adjustment of the keyframes, or by copying the first keys to the last frame of the loop. If you did the latter, then you do not need to export the last frame.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 217  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  217  Figure 6.22 The Keystone character waiting and tapping his truncheon  As the bashing is not looped, it will only play once and return to the previ- ous motion. However, if you keep the bash key held down it does, in effect, loop. What is actually happening here is that the bash animation is being told to play again.  You have a few choices of keys to control the movement, the defaults are the cursor  or arrow  keys. These are the most commonly used keys for moving characters forward, backwards, left and right. You can also select keys to control the bash motion and the jump motion. There is no key to trigger the standing motion as it is triggered by not pressing a key.  The final two options in the pop-up window are to control how the charac- ter behaves when he is jumping and falling. This is why we have created a jumping animation that does not actually jump.  See example file on the CD .   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 218  218  3D for the Web  With these two controls we can adjust the height of his jump and by chang- ing the gravity setting we can simulate other environments like being on the moon or being in water  particularly if you had created a swimming anima- tion . Also the strength of gravity affects the relative scale of the character. You want him to appear to fall with believable acceleration. You can prob- ably leave these values at their default settings, but you can change them if you want your character to jump higher, or fall in a heavier manner.  Adding a camera Well, we have finally got an interactive character, which is controllable and moves  around  a  simple  3D  world.  But,  at  the  moment,  if  you  play  the Director file, he will walk off the screen. Not much use to us. We need to be able to see him and using one or more cameras does this.  By default, when you exported your animations you selected the perspec- tive window. This uses a camera, and this camera is exported with the rest of the file information. Without a camera you would not see anything, so there is always a default camera. You can in fact have multiple cameras and either switch between them or have them displayed on the screen at once. An example use of this might be in a racing car game, where you want a split screen effect, allowing two simultaneous players, or a rear view mirror. Alternatively you might have cameras set up in certain positions and the screen displays the nearest character to that camera.  Good camera work is essential, as you do not want to make your game- player dizzy by spinning around a camera too much, or by the view of your character being blocked by objects. As this is quite a big subject we will study it in detail in the last chapter where we will be studying the issues involved in building a 3D computer game. For now we will use the behav- ior provided in the example file to allow us to view our character.  In the cast you will see the Assign Camera behavior, drag it onto the Stage, which brings up the Parameters window as shown in Figure 6.23.  You will see that there is a choice of camera type, either First or Third per- son. The difference between these is fairly self-explanatory, either the view is from the character’s eyes, or from another person’s view, i.e. the camera operator. Select Third, otherwise you will not actually see your character.  Then  select  your  control  box  object  to  look  at.  If  you  have  selected  the Keystone object, then you will find that the camera does not follow it prop- erly. This is because the character’s position changes relative to its parent object, which is the control box. Essentially the Keystone does not move anywhere relative to the control box, so the camera would stay still if it used   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:17  Page 219  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  219  Figure 6.23 The parameters pop-up window for the Assign Camera behavior  that coordinate information. Make it follow the control box, whose parent object is the ‘world’, which means everything.  The camera will now look at the axis of the control box, this is located at  the bottom of the box, but we would normally want to look at eye level. So set the ‘height above ground that you want the camera to look at’ to the eye height of the character, probably about 180 units.  The reason for selecting the ground object is that the Assign Camera behav- ior knows not to travel through the ground, which is generally unwanted. So you select the ground object and then set the minimum height that you want the camera to travel to. If you want the camera to be higher than the char- acter then set it above 200 units, perhaps at 300.  There are three choices of camera movement style – manual, simple and complicated. Select any of these to view your character, swapping between them will demonstrate the difference. The ‘manual’ setting allows you to use the mouse to view around the character and the other two methods travel to a position behind the character. They always point at the selected object.  The last option is the camera angle. A 45 degree setting gives a perspective that is roughly equivalent to that of the human eye, and so feels most natural. Feel free to experiment with this though, to view extreme perspectives.  Now you are free to make your character run around the simple checkered world, and the camera will follow him. We will make good use of this in Chapter 8, by combining your character with a game world.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 220  220  3D for the Web  Interview with Titoonic www.titoonic.dk  Company profile  Titoonic is a creative game developer and Web production company situ- ated in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company was founded in August 2000 by Peter Holm and Tomas Landgreen. Titoonic produces lively content for the Web and also own Sporkle, an online entertainment service marketed in  the Nordic region in partnership with MSN. The owner group and the cre- ative  team  come  from  a  background  in  classical  animation  and  graphic  storytelling – and eat games for breakfast.  I came across them when I was looking for sites that used Flash in an inter- esting way. That first visit was one of many as Titoonic creates wonderfully satisfying games combined with excellent character design.  Interview  The interview is with Tomas Landgreen, one of the founders of the company.  What is your role at Titoonic? I have many different roles at Titoonic. I take part in setting our company’s general goals, deciding on strategy, and other ‘big’ decisions, etc. Apart from that I spend my time on anything from programming, animation  2D 3D , painting and concepts to budgets.  Can you describe the background of your company, its aims, ambitions, client base? Most of the core employees of Titoonic come from the animation business. When we started, our aim was to do animated characters for the Web.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 221  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  221  Almost all of our first jobs involved games in some shape, and very quickly our focus began to shift towards games. Ninety-five percent of our projects now are games. Our ambition is to make entertaining quality games. The more characters, unique universes, beautiful settings and storytelling we can cram into them, the happier we are.  How many people work at Titoonic? We are 14 at the moment.  Typically how many people would work on a project? On a typical Web-game production we would have three to five people involved in the process from concept to final game.  Do you have separate 3D animators, Flash animators and Programmers, or do the skills cross-over? We  have  both.  It’s  hard  to  come  by  people  with  these  cross-over  skills. When it comes to games-programming I think that cross-over skills is what   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 222  222  3D for the Web  can  make  the  difference  between  an  ‘okay’  game  and  an  exceptional game. It can also do wonders for the production time of small Web games. If one man can do it all, you save a lot of time on having meetings and com- municating this and that back and forth.  Do you ever bring in specialist freelancers? Not very often, but we do occasionally use freelance animators or design- ers background painters.  How  important  is  sound  in  your  games  and  websites  and  who  handles  that? Sound is very important, unfortunately we don’t have enough work to have an ‘in-house’ soundman, but we have two that we use on a regular basis, for creating music, music loops, special effects, etc.  We also have a few places on the Web where we download sounds. Most of our smaller client projects, and game skins have no budget for custom recorded or created sound.   Final  sound  implementation  is  done  by  our  flash-guys,  program- mers, as well as designers.  General design and 3D How did you get started in creating 3D for the Web? I was heading up the 3D department at A-Film in Copenhagen, working on 3D  commercials  and  3D  elements  for  animated  features  when  I  started messing with 3D for the Web. It had an instant appeal to me. ‘Normal’ 3D work for films and commercials was starting to bore me. We always spend most of our time trying to satisfy a client’s need for realistic rendering, cloth animation, hair and other technical difficulties. These were things that were easily solved in any of the large 3D houses, but took a lot of hard work for a small department like ours, and it didn’t leave us much time to do the fun parts: the concept, the character designs, the animation and the storytelling. Because of the bandwidth limitation, realistic rendering was out of the ques- tion for ‘3D for the Web’. Simple character designs and simple rendering will keep the file size down. Focus is on the animation and the storytelling.  How  do  you  come  up  with  the  different  ideas  for  your  characters  and games? When it comes to me, the idea for a game will often come from a funny sketch of a character, or from a bit of code that I’m trying to put together. For client projects we will often have a ‘brainstorming’ at Titoonic to come up with ideas. We also have a writer on the regular staff.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 223  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  223  How do you decide whether to use 3D in a project? It depends a lot on the type of project, on the look and style needed and of course on production time and budget issues. If the project doesn’t have a look or graphic style that require a specific  animation type, it will typically be the amount of animation  and characters  that  decides  it.  3D  animation  is  best  suited  for  projects  that  have  large amounts of animation. 3D animation also has unique possibilities for reuse. For example, if you have a game where five characters have the same ani- mations  stand, walk, run, jump, shoot, etc. , it is a lot cheaper to do it in 3D since you can reuse modify the animations for each character. Also most of our licensable games that have characters in them  like the snowboard game  use 3D characters, because it makes it very cheap to offer the client the chance to modify, recolor or exchange the character for another one, since the animation can be reused on the new character.  Good-looking  3D  has  an  immediate  appeal.  Do  you  see  it  as  the  way  forward in Web characters? Well it is definitely one-way forward. I also think that good-looking 2D has an immediate appeal U. A well-animated, funny, appealing character, will be a success whether it is done in 3D or chiseled in stone.  How important do you think interactivity is to your work? It’s very important. We haven’t done any non-interactive work! We do have some characters and universes that may very well evolve into ‘wepisodes’, but I don’t think that we will ever make ‘wepisodes’ like they are  seen  mostly:  non-interactive.  Web-content  ends  up  on  a  computer screen, and the computer is an active media, unlike television which is a   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 224  224  3D for the Web  ‘lean-back-and-enjoy’  media.  I  don’t  think  it  wise  to  try  to  compete  with  television-series,  without  using  the  strengths  of  the  PC:  the  possibility  for interaction.  On  average  how  long  do  you  spend  developing  your  animations  and games and how much of that time is pre-production? Its very difficult to generalize here, since our projects range in production time from 1 to 24 weeks. Maybe 5–10% is pre-production. A typical cus- tom made Flash game, will take 8–10 weeks to produce, and 2 weeks of that would be spent on the concept and pre-production.  What aspect of development would you say is the most time consuming? I would definitely say budgets, but this is subjective and misleading … I really hate making budgets and consequently it seems to take forever, and I can hear every tick of the clock as I type in my wildly inaccurate estimates, as soon as I start animating and programming, time flies. On most of our games 80% of the work is finished in 20% of the time we have. The rest of the time is often spent testing and adjusting gameplay,    Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 225  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  225  putting the finishing touches, dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s. Adding all the  extra  touches  that   hopefully   will  make  this  game  stand  out  and  be entertaining and memorable.  Your past and future work Your games reflect a number of different graphic styles who what are your influences?  We try to use and take advantage of the individual styles of each of our employees, as much as possible. The characters of Pixar have always been a great inspiration to me.  Many of your websites consist of cell-shaded 3D, what is your motivation behind using cartoon style graphics?  We love the look, and it does wonders for the file size when comparing it to rendered bitmap style 3D.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 226  226  3D for the Web  How important is storytelling in a website game and how do you come up with story ideas? Again it’s really hard to generalize here. Some ‘abstract’ games like Tetris, do not need a storyline or character of any kind. In many other games a story can add the extra touch. Everybody loves to hear a good and well- presented story. The problem is often how to integrate it into the gameplay so it doesn’t feel forced or annoying. We had some good experiences with the adventure style games we did for LEGO. They are for a younger audience, and they really liked the format. Adventures, told in animated sequences, with three or four games. I think it is often quite easy to come up with games to integrate into a good story: much more difficult to have a good game and come up with a story. We have an in-house writer that does the dirty work, but we often start with brainstorming meetings to give him something to go on.  Why are your games important to clients and their websites? Games  make  the  client  customers  stay  longer  at  their  website,  thereby exposing them for a longer time to the brand, messages, etc. And more importantly it can make them come back, and make them send their friends to have a look also.  What awards have you won and have they made a difference? We won the flashForward Awards for best game and it gave us an oppor- tunity to see NY. And also gave us a lot of free PR. It’s hard exactly to guess what clients we wouldn’t have had if we hadn’t won, but I‘m sure there  are a few.  Technique What software do you use for creating websites, animations and games? 3ds max, Flash, Director, Dreamweaver, Photoshop and UltraEdit.  How much programming do you use and do you view it as an important skill for designers to have? We use a lot of programming, and the more the designers know about pro- gramming  the  easier  the  communication  is.  It  is  even  more  important  to have programmers with animation skills. When programming games a lot of animation is ‘programmed’ so a games programmer needs to have a good sense of timing and movement to create an entertaining game.  What is the most challenging aspect of 3D Web design? I  think  generally,  that  the  most  challenging  aspect  is  to  get  as  much  content animation graphics as possible within the bandwidth limitations.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 227  Chapter 6 – Animating for 3D interactivity  227  Why do you prefer to use Flash for your cartoons? It’s  a  very  fast  production  environment,  with  a  lot  of  ways  to  reuse resources, and the file size of vectorized content is minimal.  What frame rate do you typically work at for games and animations? For  Flash  games  or  animation  we  normally  work  in  25 fps   the  same  as VHS, the European television format .  Your high quality rendered animation is of a very impressive quality but con- trasts a lot in style to most of your websites. Is this because of the limitations of Web design and do you want to incorporate more of this type of 3D work into your websites? Yes, that’s true. As bandwidth increases  or we move on to producing down- load games and small boxed CD-ROM games  we will probably use this style more often.   Chap-06.qxd  8 12 04  15:18  Page 228   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 229  Chapter 7 Building virtual environments    A real and a virtual world   Terrains   Terrain building in a 3D application   Terrain building in Director   Trees   Water   Sky, clouds and backgrounds   Creating a new world   Interview with Ezone  Chapter Summary  A real and a virtual world In films you might composite computer generated characters into a real world environment that has already been filmed. Likewise the opposite might be done with human actors being superimposed onto a virtual set, using blue or green screen techniques. Of course, there are also the films where everything is generated by computer. You could use these compositing ideas for your website, but it only really works well for pre-recorded films or pre-rendered animations. The key to our Web creations is interactivity, which means that we want the ability to change camera angles in real time and for our characters to be controllable. We require our environment to have some life and for us to have the ability to explore it.  We have dealt with characters and controlling them already in this book, so now we will deal with the world in which they reside. Whether your Web project requires an interactive map or a computer game that will lure in the visitors, you will need to know how to create an environment for that. If you are making a 3D game, you will need to create the whole world, whether it is a city, a race track or a building.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 230  230  3D for the Web  The main issue with creating an environment is complexity. 3D graphics are all about geometry and the geometry of nature is very complicated. Making dirt and rubble is one of the easiest things to do in real life, but needs an amazing level of complexity to be created in computer graphics  CG . Representing nature accurately is very time consuming. Creating a blade of grass is not a highly complex task on its own, but simulating a field with millions of blades, will take a lot of computing power to display, especially if we want them in real time  Figure 7.1 . Also, it takes a lot of time to design and create thousands of objects.  Figure 7.1 A blade of grass  Designing for a game is different from designing for an animation. We need to  be  able  to  move  around  our  environment  in  real  time,  so  we  have  to employ tricks and illusions to get as near as we can to some sort of realism. You want the scenery of your game to be believable so that the users do not spend their time finding fault, but become engrossed in the experience.  This chapter is all about achieving effects to simulate outdoor environments. We will be covering techniques to create landscapes, trees and water. To   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 231  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  231  further enhance our landscape we will look at different approaches to skies and clouds, and the overall shape of the environment.  Terrains If you are creating an environment for use in interactive 3D then you could have just a flat ground; a plane with a texture on it. This is fine of course if your scene is interior, with a hard floor of stone or carpet, but outdoor scenes are more complicated. A natural landscape is rarely flat, but ranges from that of a desert to rolling hills and mountains, full of lumps and bumps  Figure 7.2 . This section looks at how the creation of a believable terrain can be achieved and the issues involved. We will explore the level of realism we can expect and what techniques can be employed to make artificial landscape creation into a straightforward operation.  Achieving a landscape or terrain does not have to be a difficult task and there are several ways to achieve it  Figure 7.3 . The main concern, as always with  Figure 7.2 A real landscape terrain, Corfe Castle, Dorset, UK  Figure  7.3 An  interpreted  virtual  terrain:  Purbeck  Light  Years,  interactive  art installation  of  a  virtual  painting,  by  Jeremy  Gardiner  and  Anthony  Head.  Corfe Castle is in the middle of the picture   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 232  232  3D for the Web  any real time 3D application, is the polygon and object count. That will be the deciding factor as to how your environment will perform. With a flat plane there  is  no  need  to  have  many  polygons,  which  in  turn  means  that  most  computers will be able to play the piece at a decent frame rate of around  30 frames per second. A flat plane need only consist of two triangle polygons  put together to make a square , but a terrain is going to consist of thousands to tens of thousands of triangles. How do you decide how many your land- scape  needs  when  there  is  such  a  range  in  the  power  of  computers? The answer  is,  perhaps  unsatisfactorily,  trial  and  error  testing  and  compromise. Ideally, your terrain is going to be made of millions of polygons, with minute detail, but this is not practically possible. All you can do is test it on several speeds of computer, unless you are happy to let it work only on the latest graph- ics cards. As a guide a terrain of around 8000 polygons is going to be fairly detailed, and will work on older graphics cards. If there are hundreds of other objects in your scene then your frame rate will decrease and a high frame rate is part of the key to believability in interactive 3D. It has to feel real more than look real.  So, we are going to create a landscape of around 8000 triangles. We will assume it is a square shape, although it could be a rectangle. A grid of 64  cid:2  64 squares will contain 4096 squares, which in turn means 8192 tri- angular polygons  Figure 7.4 . Although working in powers of 2, i.e. 2, 4, 8,  Figure 7.4 A wireframe view of Purbeck Light Years, showing the terrain mesh with 4096 squares   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 233  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  233  16 … 64 is not essential when dealing with polygons, it is important for tex- tures. To this end it is handy to use a 64  cid:2  64 grid for the terrain mesh, we can easily double it if we need to.  Note  A texture is the bitmap image that can be mapped onto any shape. In real time 3D you are limited by the fact that you cannot easily create Bump mapping effectively. This means that all ‘textures’ are smooth, using  only  visual  information  to  give  the  illusion  of  surface  quality.  A  texture  is  a  property  of  a  shader.  A  shader  is  equivalent  to  a Material  in  3ds  max,  and  it  controls  and  describes  how  an  object’s surface will look, e.g. the shininess, the image, the color, the position of the image, etc.  Edge of the world  So we are going to make a grid of 64 rows and columns into a landscape, but that is not realism. What happens when we reach the end of that area? You do not want people to be able to walk up to the edge of your ‘world’ so you will have to find ways of stopping them. You can do this by creating walls or limiting the ability to walk near the edge of the world. You should view this restriction as a way to focus the user into the scene that you have created.  There are several methods of terrain creation and we will discuss a few of them. All of the examples talked about are included as files on the CD supplied with the book. They will allow you to use and enhance the results of these techniques.  Terrain building in a 3D application Using modifiers  The simplest method to create a terrain would be to use a 3D package.  You could create a mesh and apply a Noise modifier  Figures 7.5 and 7.6  or better still a Terrain modifier. This would give you a landscape, with high points and low points. The workings of this involve fractal mathematics and random numbers to create the look of the landscape. This is great for build- ing islands and rolling landscapes but has the major drawback of not allow- ing the user to specify exactly where or how they create the features of the surface. You cannot usually say that you want a hill here and there; you rely on trial and error to choose the correct seed  the random number used for the calculations . This can be fine, but if you have a specific purpose or plan for your world, it is unsatisfactory. A more personalized solution is needed.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 234  234  3D for the Web  Figure 7.5 A fractal Noise modified plane, with another plane indicating water  Figure 7.6 A close-up view of the fractal Noise modified plane  Displacement mapping  Using a displacement map on your plane is a method that gives you much more control over your landscape design. The idea is that you have an image that represents the heights of the land that you want simulated. This could be created by hand in a paint program or could use real satellite data. Height or terrain maps are usually color coded in gray scale, with white being the highest height and black being the lowest. Exactly what heights are repre- sented is unimportant in a virtual world, what matters are that they are cor- rect relative to the scale of your other objects and the size of the world. For this purpose, it is advisable to have a height map that uses the full range of 256 shades of gray  Figure 7.7 .  The terrain map should always be the same aspect ratio as your grid, in our case 1:1 or square. As a bitmap it needs to be only the same size as our grid, i.e. in image resolution of 64  cid:2  64. When you edit this image you will see that this is very small, but it is as detailed as our landscape. If it makes life easier you can work on a higher resolution image and scale it down when   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 235  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  235  Figure 7.7 The displacement terrain map use for Purbeck Light Years  you are happy with it. What you need to remember is that this image is not what is going to be seen. This image is only used to change the heights of the vertices in the mesh, to displace it. What you will see in your finished terrain is the Diffuse map, which is the bitmap image of your landscape  perhaps an overhead photograph, or a tiled picture of grass .  Terrain building in Director As download size is always a concern when creating Shockwave movies for the Web, another way to create your terrain is to generate it entirely in Director. This is not as complicated as you may think and you can apply the same  principles  as  for  the  displacement  map  previously  described.  The example Director file creates a landscape and applies a map to it  Figure 7.8 . The processes involved are:  1. Create a plane with a 64 square resolution  or greater, if required . 2. Find the terrain image and check the gray-scale value of each pixel on the image  row by row  and move the y position of the corresponding vertex in the map, multiplied by a vertical scale.  3. Apply a landscape image for color.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 236  236  3D for the Web  Figure 7.8 A terrain created with the Terrain Generator program, with its terrain map  The vertical scale that the map is multiplied by is calculated by deciding what you want the maximum height of your land to be, in world units. This depends on the scale of your whole world, if a tree is 20 units high then you might want a mountain to be a few thousand units high. The scale is up to you, you just need to remember that you will be navigating over it.  Once you have created a terrain you need to work out what you want on it. Of course, if you are planning a game or interactive environment then you should have already decided this. After all, everything in your world needs to be there for a reason, whether that be esthetic or practical. Also, if you want a character to walk around it then you cannot practically have incredibly steep hills, as this will not be very believable, and can be awkward from a technical point of view. A vertical slope would be something you want to collide with, and a gentle slope something to walk over. Gentle slopes look better as severe changes in heights emphasize the triangular nature of the mesh sides, whereas in gentle elevations the mesh appears smooth and not faceted. CG cards have built-in capabilities to help smooth meshes, but this is just a visual trick and does not mean that the mesh has any more polygons.  Fractal terrains  Landscapes can be created using fractal math. This might sound compli- cated but there are many software applications that can create terrains in this way. The most popular is Corel Bryce, where you add objects, clouds and weather to your landscapes. The following section provides a descrip- tion of how mathematical terrains are created.  There are many fields in the study of fractal mathematics, but the fundamental similarity is the concept of iterations. Simply put, iterating means repeating   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 237  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  237  the same calculation again and again. The fractal element means that these iterations occur at finer and finer levels of detail, in a fraction of the space.  Briefly speaking, a terrain map is created by having a grid of four squares, of random color values. This is then sub-divided, smoothed and decreasingly randomized until the required resolution is reached. Figure 7.9 illustrates this with a terrain map being generated using random fractal generation and smoothing in eight stages.  Figure 7.9 A fractal terrain map being formed. Each stage being divided and replaced with squares half the size with a random variation in tone  The example Terrain Map Generator program allows you to create a terrain map, for use in your own projects. However, as I mentioned earlier when describing the terrain mesh generator in 3ds max, you do not have any con- trol over where the peaks and troughs, the hills and valleys, are located. It is a random process. Often, you might use a random terrain map as a start and then edit the bitmap to create the desired shape of landscape.  Another use for terrain maps of this kind is to make cloud maps. It is a curi- ous quirk that a bit of tweaking of the code for the Terrain Generator makes many varieties of cloud formations. I will leave that to the more Lingo knowl- edgeable amongst you to adapt the program to do that, and we will discuss making clouds later on in the chapter with other techniques.  Trees Now we have built a landscape, the next thing to do will be to populate it with some objects. Of course, if we build objects then we need to make sure   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 238  238  3D for the Web  we do not crash into them when we are moving around the world. This is essential for any interactive game where you control a character or yourself around the world. We will discuss this in the next chapter, but first we will build some trees. Making trees is a handy way to describe several useful modeling and texturing tips.  In the real world there are many thousands of varieties of trees, and if you want more than one tree in your project, then you will probably want more than one variety. There are several methods for creating trees, each one having its own pros and cons. The methods do not depend on the type of tree you want, but concern how the trees are made. They vary in complexity, both from a creation point of view as well as an aesthetic point of view.  The single plane method  This is a classic technique in the world of game design, and the simplest way to create a believable looking tree. The principle is that simple objects make  for  fast  frame  rates  and  photographic  textures  make  for  realistic scenes. So if you place a photograph of an object on a plane, with a trans- parent border, you can make a reasonably convincing object. The audience does not see a square plane, but the irregular outline of the object on a see- through background, e.g. the shape of the tree. This concept has long been used in 3D games, particularly racing games where trees, spectators and billboards  rush  past  the  car.  The  technique  does  not  stand  up  to  close scrutiny, but when you are rushing past scenery, your brain happily believes the realism of the objects.  Note  As a plane is obviously a flat shape, you might expect this technique to look very odd, as you could walk around an object, and it would appear to be flat. This is overcome by having the objects always face the camera, so that you always see the front  unless the object is meant to  be  flat .  So  it  works  well  for  trees  because  they  are  complicated images  that  are  not  particularly  recognizable,  that  is  all  the  leaves look the same, so you are less likely to notice the issue of it always  facing you.  To start this concept you need to get hold of a picture of a tree. It is always best to take your own photographs so you will not have to worry about copyright issues. The next step will be to scan it, if it is not a digital photo, and get it into a photo-editing package. You should then crop the picture down so that only the tree you want is left in view  Figure 7.10 . Do not worry too much if there are other trees visible right behind the one you want as you will create what is known as an alpha channel in which you will make everything you do not want to see invisible. By making your picture   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:19  Page 239  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  239  partially transparent, you are in effect erasing the unwanted parts. The fol- lowing description uses Adobe PhotoShop to achieve this, but it should be achievable in other image-editing packages.  Figure 7.10 A cropped photograph of a tree  The simplest method is to use tools such as Color Selection and Quick Mask. This will select an area and allow us to remove it from our picture. First of all, we need to make our image into a floating layer. In the Layers palette you  should  see  that  your  picture  has  just  one  layer  and  it  has  a  closed  padlock icon next to it. This is because it is the background layer and hence cannot be masked in the way we would like. You need to select Duplicate Layer and then remove the background layer by selecting and pressing the trashcan icon at the bottom of the palette. Now you have a floating layer called Layer 1, unless you have renamed it  Figure 7.11 . This means that when  you  erase  parts  of  the  image,  the  alpha  transparency  is  revealed underneath.  Note  Any color in CG is made up of 256 shades of red, green and blue  RGB  channels .  But  you  can  also  have  another  channel,  known  as alpha  RGBA . The alpha channel is 256 shades of transparency, from transparent to opaque. This is very useful in the world of compositing and masking. We are using an alpha channel to be a mask, so that we can essentially composite just the tree into our 3D scene.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 240  240  3D for the Web  Figure 7.11 The Layers palette with the background layer  Now you can select Color Range from the Select menu of PhotoShop. You will see your tree represented in Black and White only. Pressing down on your image will select different color ranges and holding down the Shift key will add to a selection  the Alt key does the opposite . You need to select the colors in your image that are not in the tree, i.e. not the green leaves. When you accept this selection you will see a moving dashed line surrounding your selected areas. This is unlikely to be perfect and parts of your tree might be selected. This is why we use the Quick Mask tool.  Pressing the Edit in Quick Mask button  near the bottom of the tool palette , converts the selection to a red and orange tint. Everything that is orange  or red will be protected and everything else will form part of the selection. It is here that you can neaten up your selection by painting black onto your tree. It is probable that the trunk did not get selected properly, so use a fine brush and paint over these areas. You will see that the dark trunk appears red. This shows that it will not be part of the selection. Figure 7.12 shows a  black  and  white  image  of  a  cleaned  up  mask  image.  Everything  that is black will be transparent, and white, solid. The gray areas will appear semi-transparent.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 241  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  241  Figure 7.12 A mask created from the photograph  When you are happy with your mask, go back to Edit in Standard mode and then press the Delete key to remove the selection. You will see a checkered pattern where your image will be invisible  Figure 7.13 . This is the alpha layer. Your image is now ready to save.  Figure 7.13 The tree showing the transparent background   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 242  242  3D for the Web  You should resize your image to a suitable texture size; I suggest 256  cid:2  256 pixels. Then select File  cid:3  Save for Web in PhotoShop. You will be presented with a new screen. Select portable network graphic  PNG -24 as the file type  the default option is graphics interchange format  GIF  . PNG-24 includes the alpha channel information we need. Save the file as TreeFinal.png  There is an example file on the CD called Tree Generator. If you open this up and import your file into it your tree will appear in a simple scene. Feel free to adjust the settings but this is just a file for example purposes.  This method is a compromise, it is the simplest way to create a realistic tree, but is not at all convincing if you rotate it. From a front-on view it looks fine, but when you see it from the side, it is thin, bordering on invisible. This is why the Tree Generator program makes the tree rotate when you move around  using the cursor keys . The trees are always facing you. This technique has been used for a long time in 3D games, and only feels strange when you are very close to the tree  Figure 7.14 .  Figure 7.14 The tree mapped onto planes and put into a simple scene, using the Tree Generator program   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 243  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  243  Two and three plane trees  An advance on this method for tree creation would be to create either one or two copies of the tree plane, and rotate them. If there are two planes in total, then rotate the second one by 90 degrees; if there are three in total, then rotate the second and third by 60 and 120 degrees, respectively. This method gets around the cardboard nature of the plane method, but has one major drawback in Shockwave: it does not render correctly. Normally when you have two objects intersecting, you cannot see behind them, but when an alpha channel is used, the transparency information is rendered after all the models are, often resulting in an visually confusing scene. This is hopefully an issue that will be solved in future versions of Shockwave 3D engine, but as yet remains a problem. Another drawback of this method is that you are increasing the number of objects in your scene, and if you have hundreds of trees this will slow down the frame rate.  Using an image plane is useful on two points; from the realism issue it uses photographs that are obviously generated from nature. The other issue is geometry. This method uses a low number of faces, meaning that you can have  many  trees  in  your  scene  without  compromising  the  speed  of  the graphics  card.  However,  this  may  not  be  the  style  you  want,  so  we  will explore a different type of tree.  A solid tree  If you do not need hundreds of trees in your project then there are other more stylistic ways to create trees. One method would be to use the polygonal modeling methods that you have used so far in this book. You could start with a simple box for the trunk. Then apply the Edit Mesh modifier and reshape it, extruding the polygons to create branches. The foliage could be made with another box that can be reshaped to fit the branches  Figure 7.15 .  If you use the Mesh Smooth modifier on each object the look is more natural and with the addition of the UVW map modifier and some appropriate mate- rials, you will have a stylized tree  Figure 7.16 . One point to make here is that you do not need to create the branches if you have solid foliage, you just need to create the trunk. However, if you are making a wintry world, then you do not need the foliage, but would need to enhance the branch structure.  This method certainly looks good from the point of view of quality, but it does use a lot of polygons and so it is not advised for large forests. However, if you only have a few trees and you do not want photorealism then this might be the ideal approach to take. Also, remember that geometry adds to   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 244  244  3D for the Web  Figure 7.15 A polygon extruded trunk and reshaped box foliage  Figure 7.16 The tree after Mesh Smoothing and the application of appropriate materials   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 245  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  245  the download time of a Web game, so you would probably only create one tree and use it to clone new ones when your game is loaded. This idea will be discussed in the last chapter.  Forests  It is all very well creating a few trees, but you might want more of a forest effect. There are a few ways to do this easily. The slowest method would be to place each model in your scene, one by one. Naturally, this could take you quite a while if you have lots of trees. There is a plug-in for 3ds max called Forest Lite which enables you to quickly and easily build forests using ‘plane’ trees, but it is not compatible with Shockwave  this is often the case with third party plug-ins which may save you time if you are creating ani- mations for rendering, but are not supported for Shockwave 3D . You could adapt the Tree Generator program supplied with this book instead.  If you need to simulate a whole forest and you wanted to be able to view it  with thousands of trees  then you could create large long planes with bitmap textures with lots of trees on them. You could create this by adding lots of tree pictures together, or finding the edge of a real forest and using that as an image for your texture. You could then position these planes in rows to create your forest.  The Tree Generator program places trees in random positions, but it is possible to place them precisely by using a map. This idea is used in the last chapter for positioning objects in your scene in an efficient manner.  Water The depiction of water in an environment can take many forms: whether you are trying to simulate a bucket of water, a sink, a pond, a river, a lake, a sea, a waterfall, a hose pipe, rain fall, ice, steam, condensation and so on. Each type of water has many different properties to consider, e.g. color, refraction, opacity, form, reflectivity and motion. It is through the combination of these properties that you can create a believable surface. In the next few sections we will talk about the techniques that you can use to achieve the desired effect for your various forms of water.  Ocean Wave Generator  This technique is not necessarily practical for a game, due to the amount of  processing involved, but it might have a use as a sequence or a special effect.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 246  246  3D for the Web  To make convincing waves, e.g. ocean waves, then you need to employ a technique called Mesh Deformation. The main issue with waves is that they move, as opposed to a terrain, which is fixed. You could make an undulat- ing surface and place it in your scene, but it would look unconvincing and plastic. We need to create a wave pattern dynamically that animates in a natural manner.  The example file, Ocean Wave Generator, does what it says but has many limitations; it is slow and works on small meshes  Figure 7.17 . The following paragraphs describe how the program works. It does get quite technical, but this is necessary if you really want to understand this method for creating waves. There are other methods to achieve this, but this would be turning wave making into a specialist subject and you may not ever need to use them.  Making waves  We first create a plane which has a grid resolution of 32 units. This will be the surface that we will undulate. Now we need to understand the mathematics of waveforms and the control we can have over them.  Figure 7.17 Six screenshots of the Ocean Wave Generator   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 247  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  247  You can use straightforward math to create simple waves effects, adding a few sine waves together creates a more complex pattern which move when the time variable is incremented.  Figure  7.18  shows  three  sine  waves,  which  have  different  wavelengths   the distance that the wave repeats  and different amplitudes  the height of the wave . When these are added together a more complex waveform is created.  Figure 7.18 Three sine waves and the result of adding them together  The diagram actually describes one point moving over time. We have cre- ated a mesh that has a resolution of 32, meaning 932  cid:2  32 grid of points. We want to animate all of them, with a sine wave that is offset  so that they do not all move up and down at the same time . We can use the coordinate of each vertex as the offset for our sine wave.  The description below shows the principle as an equation  written in short- ened English and then in Lingo code . When calculating sine values Lingo   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 248  248  3D for the Web  requires radians to be used. This is often a bit difficult for people to under- stand, as they are more used to working in degrees. Therefore, it is easier to think in degrees and then convert to radians. However, it does take a fraction of a second longer to calculate.  57.2958  cid:4  the number to divide by when converting degrees to radians  wave height equals sine   time step plus the coordinate  divided by 57.2958  times by the maximum wave height.  Key:  Lingo:  waveheight  cid:4  sine  time  cid:5  coordinate  57.2958   cid:2  maxwaveheight.  In simplified terms, all you need to do is create sine waves in the x- and  z-axis of your mesh and change the y-axis  the height  to the resulting ampli- tude  at  each  coordinate.  The  sine  waves  depend  on  the  coordinates  to form. You can then shift this by adding an incremental value to the coordinate, i.e. time.  This creates a simple wave pattern, if you want more complexity then all you need to do is add another sine wave on and adjust the variables. For simplic- ity change the 57.2958 number to 20. This has the effect of shortening the wavelength, increasing the number will lengthen the wave. If you have two sine waves added together, one with a short wavelength and the other a long wave then you end up with the effect of waves on top of waves. Change the time variable by dividing it by 4 will reduce the wave speed to a quarter, so you could have a fast wave on top of a slow wave. Take apart the Ocean Wave Generator program to decipher more details from this.  This is a fairly naturalistic approach to creating waves for an ocean scene. The major drawback is the computer processing time. Our mesh only contains 1024 vertices and trying to process this is a significant drain on your com- puter’s power. This may already appear slow on your computer. If you increase the resolution of your mesh, then it will slow down even more. This is why it is not particularly suitable for inclusion in a game. You can speed things up by pre-calculating the sine values, but I recommend use this technique sparingly, on small objects.  One reason why this technique is slow is because the program creates and deletes a mesh every frame. It has to do this in order to Generate Normals. Normals are descriptions of the directions that each face is pointing. The description is a vector direction, e.g. vector 0.34,  cid:6 0.29, 0.87 . The vector is an X, Y and Z value between  cid:6 1 and 1. Without going any further into Vector Math here, the reason why this information needs to be calculated is so that light will shine properly on to the object, and faces will be in shadow   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 249  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  249  if they are not pointing at the light. This is why you can see light and dark areas on the six images taken from the Ocean Wave Generator. This was used in the Terrain Generator as well.  Flags  A great use for this method is for flags. Flags ripple in a very similar manner to water waves and obviously do not require a mesh anywhere near as big as an ocean. See the Flag program for a simple demonstration  Figure 7.19 . It is possible to improve these techniques by including interaction. Instead of a time element creating the waveform, the wind could be variable and gravity and tension could be added to the material of the flag. If the waveform is slower then the substance of the Flag, or liquid is effected. A thick substance like honey would behave in a very different way to water.  Figure 7.19 A still from the naturally waving flag example  Properties of water  One  obvious  property  of  water  is  its  ability  to  reflect  light,  like  a  semi- transparent mirror. Any glossy surface will contain reflections, showing the other objects in a scene. However, true reflection is not an inherent property of the Shockwave engine and overcoming this can be a difficult challenge. I will explain some of the methods that should help you on your way to achieving this effect.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 250  250  3D for the Web  Let us first isolate exactly what properties a reflected image has, compared to a normal image, so that we can try to apply these properties. One aspect is its brightness. As we are dealing with reflections on water, the reflected image is going to be darker than the original view, due to the fact that some of the light is absorbed. As well as being darker the image will be affected by the color of the water. But be careful here, most water is not colored unless it is dirty. The sea is blue because it reflects the sky, which is blue. Seaweed and algae can make it look green. Generally the color of your sea will be black but fairly transparent, a puddle or a bowl of water will be completely transparent, but the reflections will affect it. Because it is transparent, the objects below it will show through, this will also affect the apparent color of the water, e.g. sand.  Rippled reflections  If your water is rippled or wavy then this is going to affect and distort the reflected image. This is probably the most difficult effect to achieve convinc- ingly and is not likely to be achievable if you have a large surface of water. It would involve creating our reflected image and texture-mapping it onto our water, which is a mesh being deformed via the methods we covered earlier. It is possible, but may not be a practical solution, as you have to take a screen grab of the image to be reflected and then map it onto the reflecting object  the water or mirror . This process is relatively slow and if the water is moving then the frame rate will probably become unacceptably slow.  As well as the reflected image we would also expect to see light sources highlighting the water, known as specular light. In Director this is the shini- ness property of the shader and is a value between 0 and 100. Note that with this property, zero has the widest area for the specular highlight and this property changes dramatically between zero and one. After one, the shininess gradually decreases, giving a more satin and eventually matte effect.  Reflection map  A simple method to achieve a reflective type of surface is to use the Reflection map property of the Standard Shader in Director. With this property you can select a texture that is used as the reflected surface on the object that the shader is applied to. This gives it a reflective feel but it does not actually reflect, in the Raytracing sense of the word, it is not a real mirror. This works quite well for metallic surfaces, but is probably not convincing enough for water if there are other objects in the scene. However, it should be alright if you are just reflecting the sky, assuming it has plenty of clouds. You could use the same texture for the reflected image as you have used for the sky. This technique was used with 3ds max in Chapter 3 for the sound art piece. A Bitmap was used in the Reflection map property.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 251  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  251  The Reflection map works by keeping the mapping coordinates of a texture in the same position as your view of a model as it changes position or shape. This gives the illusion of a reflective surface and works best with shapes that are not just flat planes, but are more complicated, e.g. a kettle. So if the water is rippled, the effect should be reasonably convincing  Figure 7.20 .  Figure 7.20 A sky texture mapped as a Reflection map  top and left  and a planar map  middle and right , with specular light   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 252  252  3D for the Web  Reflections through cloning  If you decide not to use the Reflection map, and your water is meant to be calm, then there is a simple way to achieve perfect reflections. You could use the Mirror function in 3ds max to create a duplicate of all the models  in your scene. They need then to be placed below the surface of the water, as far away as they were above the water. This will create a perfect mirror image of your world. The water can then just be a semi-transparent plane that cuts through this, with an amount of shininess which could simulate the sun reflecting the surface. As the water Plane should have a dark color to it, this makes the underwater objects look darker, hence making a convincing reflection  effect.  This  is  theoretically,  a  fairly  simple  solution,  but  it  does have drawbacks. If your scene already has a lot of geometry then doubling it could slow your whole project down to an unacceptable speed. Also, this effect  does  not  take  into  account  refraction  and  how  that  will  affect  an image. Another problem is that if you want to see other objects below the surface of the water then the mirrored objects are going to interfere with them, getting in the way. Having said this, depending on your own project, this might be the straightforward answer you need.  Sky, clouds and backgrounds If you are creating an artificial world then there are going to be limitations to your design. You cannot create a real planet with as much detail and objects as you find on Earth, you have to make compromises. The main issue is where the ground ends and the sky begins, but in a virtual world the Earth is flat! If we treated the sky as a flat plane then it would never reach the hori- zon, there would be a gap between the ground and sky.  Note  In reality the ground does not reach the sky. You could mimic this by having  a  Sphere  for  the  ground  and  an  outer  Sphere  for  the  sky, instead of using distorted planes. This would be fine if we did not have a polygon count issue. To make a believable globe you would need billions  of  polygons  all  around  it  to  allow  for  hills  and  valleys,  far beyond the scope of real time 3D.  This is why terrains are usually based on planes. You need to decide how to restrict the user from getting too near the edge of your world. Perhaps you use natural barriers like mountain ranges, or artificial ones like houses.  So, given that we have a finite plane for our land, the sky must be created to look natural and believable. There are several methods that can be used   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 253  Note  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  253  to create a sky for your scene, they mainly involve mapping textures on to shapes. It is the shapes and their positions that are important.  Theoretically,  if  you  wanted  to  make  the  whole  world  as  one  model with a vertex every meter, then it would require 511,405,027,689, 820 vertices! That is 511 trillion points on its surface. As this is such a huge amount then you would have to use an alternative approach to modeling the whole world. The best method would be to use a data- base system that loaded in each section of the world as you arrived in it. So only a small area would be visible at any one time.  Backdrops  The simplest method for a sky is to use a camera backdrop, with a cloud pic- ture on it. A camera backdrop is a bitmap texture that appears behind all the objects in a scene and usually fills up the whole of the screen  Figure 7.21 . Changing the camera’s viewpoint does not affect the position of the back- drop in relation to the view. Using a camera backdrop is usually fine if you  Figure 7.21 A photo that can be used for a backdrop   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 254  254  3D for the Web  have just a plain blue sky, but begins to look unnatural if you use a photo- graph of clouds as a texture. Because the backdrop always stays in the same position, moving around the scene does not move the view of the clouds, making your environment look odd and unreal. Generally speaking, back- drops  are  only  useful  for  abstract  worlds  or  environments  where  the  camera’s viewpoint does not change  Figure 7.22 .  Figure 7.22 The backdrop used with a terrain  Haze or atmospheric perspective  Another issue in the real world is haze. The picture that has been used in the diagram   Figure  7.22   has  a  significant  amount  of  haze  in  it.  Haze  is caused by air pollution and water vapor. As you look further and further into the distance the saturation of color decreases until the land eventually disappears into the sky. This natural effect is actually helpful to our perception of the world and is known as atmospheric perspective. Because we know that air desaturates our real world we can get a sense of scale in a virtual world if haze effect is simulated  Figure 7.23 . Without it your scene just will not feel real or rather it will feel small.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 255  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  255  Figure 7.23 Using fog to create atmospheric perspective and a sense of scale to the virtual world  Fortunately graphics cards manufacturers have long since understood the potential of haze. It is known as fog, in particular camera fog. Why potential? Well, we know that we cannot display thousands of objects in our scene at once, so by using camera fog, we can fade out the world from the point of the camera into the distance. Once the fog becomes total, i.e. the color set up for the fog, then you do not need to display any objects further than that distance.  You can set near and far distances for the fog, where it starts and finishes. You can then set the camera not to draw any objects further than that dis- tance, this is known as the setting the camera ‘yon’ property, yon meaning distant but within sight, it is derived from the archaic word ‘yonder’.  Note  It is important to realize that fog affects only objects in your scene. The camera backdrop will not be affected as it is not an object. This means that the colors in the background picture remain the same and are not desaturated.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 256  256  3D for the Web  Texture on a background plane, cylinder and sphere  An alternative to the camera backdrop is to place a texture on an object that is positioned at the back of your scene. In old computer games  particularly car racing games  this used to be a flat plane that scrolled right and left and as you turned left and right. This gave the illusion that you had a 360 degree panorama. A better way to deal with this is to use a cylinder that completely encircles your world. You can wrap a texture on the inside of this shape. You could take photographs and use a panorama-stitching program to create your own photorealistic textures to use in this way. The important point is that your texture needs to match at each end as the left side will meet the right. One restriction of using a cylinder arises from looking upwards. You cannot get away with this method if you need to look up above you as there will be a hole in the sky! But your project may not require looking up, so this could well be the solution you need.  If you are able to look up above you in your world, then you could use a sphere object that has a spherical projection map wrapped on it. You would actually only use a dome part of the sphere, the rest of it being below ground. When creating a texture map for this you have to be careful where the texture meets as it wraps around the sphere  remember that all textures are square in shape . You could use an image-editing program with a polar-coordinate distorting filter. This could turn a texture into a distorted round shape that you could map on your sphere.  This method also causes issues with the fog technique described ear- lier. As the plane, cylinder or sphere is an object, it will be affected by the color of the fog. This is probably not the result you desire. It is pos- sible to stop the object being affected by fog, but it has problems and involves understanding how z-buffer works. The z-buffer is used to cal- culate how to draw all the objects in a scene so that they overlap cor- rectly for the distance they are from the camera. This is starting to get into graphics programming territory that this book is not intended to cover. If you are interested, then there are hundreds of articles, papers and books available on graphics programming, a quick search on the Internet will get you started.  Sky plane  A simple alternative to a cylinder is to have a plane that completely covers the sky, parallel to the ground. This plane could have a cloud texture on it which could even be animated showing the traveling of clouds across the sky. Logically the plane is rectangular and any texture you place on it will also  Note   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 257  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  257  be rectangular, so it will fit well. There are a few issues involved with this kind of sky. The height above the ground is important. If it is too low and you could literally walk into it whereas if it is too high then you could see the edges of it, forming an unconvincing square in the sky. The higher the sky plane is then the larger it needs to be to cover your world. It will almost certainly need to be bigger than your world.  The main issue is seeing the edge of the plane and if you are near the edge of your world you do not want that to happen. If your sky is large enough then you can use the technique described earlier, camera fog, or distance fog to hide the edge of your sky. You can set where the camera fog starts  i.e. no fog  and where it ends  solid color . The distance is always measured away from the camera and any object in that range will be colored by an amount dependent upon its position from the camera. Using distance fog in this way, usefully hides the edge of the sky plane and works on a sub-conscious level to make us believe that your artificial world is as big as the real world, because of the atmospheric dulling  Figure 7.24 .  Figure 7.24 Using a flat plane to create a sky   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 258  258  3D for the Web  Although this effect works it is not ideal because the sky appears flat, whereas a real sky has a curvature to it. An improvement on this version would be to bend the plane so that it arcs across the sky in a concave manner. This is a bit like a dome, which could be used as an alternative. The important thing would be for the texture to be mapped in a planar manner. If you do not do this  then  you  will  end  up  with  unwanted  and  unnatural  distortions  on  it. These distortions are even more exaggerated if you decide to use a Sphere as your sky world.  Making clouds  You can use various techniques to create convincing cloud formations for a sky plane. One option would be to use a program like Bryce, which has a cloud generator in it where you can specify the type of clouds you want, e.g. cirrus or cumulus. But Bryce does not refer to a library of sky photographs, it calculates the clouds using fractal mathematics, in the same manner as we did with the Terrain Map Generating program. PhotoShop has a render clouds function,  and  using  this  in  conjunction  with  layers,  and  other  filters  can  produce very believable cloud formations.  It is worth experimenting when making clouds. You could scan paintings, or take close-up photos of grounds. Then by blurring, adjusting the contrast, or selecting different areas, you can build up a cloud image. Of course, you could photograph real clouds. Another useful thing to do is make the image tileable,  like  the  cloud  image  shown  in  Figure  7.25.  This  way  you  can repeat the clouds when you map them  by changing the scale of the texture  and you could even animate the texture in Director, to give the appearance of the clouds moving. This does not mean creating hundreds of cloud images, but translating the coordinates of the image map.  Skybox  One last option for skies is to make a skybox. This technique can only really be achieved using a 3D package such as Bryce. The idea is that you can create a complete representation of a world from one point of view and project that onto a cube. The cube has six faces and each one has a view from the camera projected onto it. The idea is to use a 90 degree lens and take snapshots at 90 degree intervals in a panoramic fashion. Then you take a vertical snapshot of the sky in line with one of the other sides. You could create a ground image, but you will almost certainly be creating a ground using a mesh. Mapping these five or six pictures onto the sides of   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 259  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  259  Figure 7.25 The texture map used for the sky in Figure 7.24  the cube may make you think that there will be distortions where they meet. But this technique actually works because of that distortion. The sides match up perfectly to give an illusion of a spherical world. However, when you are in the 3D environment that you have created you have to bear in mind that the skybox works only for one point of view. This means that you need the box to move with the camera, so that you never approach the edge of it, but remain at its center.  Creating a new world Now we have covered most of the ways to create a world, we might as well combine the various elements to see a complete environment. The final fig- ure in this chapter  Figure 7.26  adds together the Terrain Generator, Tree Generator,  and  Sky  and  Water  Generator  to  make  a  landscape,  with atmospheric  perspective.  The  sun  moves  around  this  world  and  casts  a changing light, whilst the clouds roll by.

It consists of two Australian brothers, Simon and Jamie Edis, pictured here with an imaginary third brother in their Lenny Loosejocks creation.  The Edis brothers started Ezone in 1996, while living in San Francisco, USA, but they moved back to Australia in 2000, taking Lenny with them. Their repu- tation is built on solid game-writing skills and they are relative newcomers to 3D. But as you can see from such games as ‘SpaceWombat’, working in 3D has not damaged their quirky sense of humor and brilliant use of sound. When I first happened upon Lenny, I was, like many others, drawn by the weird name, but I stayed and played a lot of games because they are such fun. I am convinced that this is Ezone’s secret ingredient; they obviously love their work, and their sense of fun comes through in the spontaneous nature of all their games.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 262  262  3D for the Web  Interview  When did you start creating games for the Web? Ezone.com  started  off  as  a  Web  development hosting  company  but  we realized  that  it  wouldn’t  be  long  before  that  market  was  saturated.  We started making Web games pretty much right when Macromedia Shockwave came out around 1996. Jamie had worked with a program called Macromind Director 1.0 during Film school in Perth, and thought it was a great tool so we got a copy and started experimenting. After a few really basic games we started putting more complex game play and detail into them.  Can you describe the genesis of Ezone? Your complimentary skills as broth- ers must help! Each game that we developed we learned something new and the games just kept getting better and better, so much better in fact that clients became interested in our games. Simon’s  engineering  background  made  him  the  perfect  programmer.  He knows and understands numbers, physics and just general ‘technical’ stuff you need to program good games. Jamie’s skill in drawing, animation, character voices, sound design and music made him perfect for the ‘creative’ stuff. Combined with a similar bizarre sense of humor, it makes for a very com- plimentary game-making partnership.  Typically how many people would work on a game project? On most games just the two of us.  As a small company it takes a long time to develop a game. Do you think there are advantages of being a small outfit?  Actually it’s probably faster being a small company, as a lot of people usually equals a lot of meetings and the ‘too many cooks’ syndrome. We can remember when we were doing some client work for one of the big studios down in L.A., and Jamie would get frustrated when they wanted us for a meeting. In the time it takes for us to fly down there, drive to the studio and meet with them I could have had all the animation and sounds for the game done.  How long do you spend developing your games and how much of that time is pre-production? We usually just jump straight into a game and see what works. Although we probably should spend more time planning, Jumping straight in allows for faster development of games. Sometimes you can over plan a project; the   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 263  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  263  lack of planning can often translate into spontaneous ideas and more freedom. Of course some projects do require and benefit from a good amount of plan- ning. Our games can take anywhere from a week to many months to develop.  How many games will you work on at once? We usually have at least two going at a time, sometimes more that are in early development phases.  Game design and production How do you come up with the ideas for your games? Sometimes they just pop into our heads, other times we look at what type of games we’d like to do and that are missing from our site and develop an idea to fill that gap.  Can you tell us something about Lenny Loosejocks and how it felt adapting him to 3D? On the one hand it was great to see a 3D model of Lenny walking around, but on the other he’s little ‘clumsy’ to translate into 3D. He’s very tall and   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 264  264  3D for the Web  skinny and his usual rubbery 2D cartoony moves are difficult to translate into a low-poly 3D character. We may overcome this problem in the future. Meanwhile, stumpy characters such as the Space Wombat seem to suit the current 3D arena that we are working in quite well.  The animation quality and sound in your games is always very good, how important do you think it is? It’s pretty much everything.  The  Internet  has  for  many  years  been  used  as  a  vehicle  for  multi-player games, and for several years as 3D multi-player games. How do you see this area affecting the game market in the future? Multi-player is great in that it adds a new dimension to games, and also raises the replayability factor because of the random human element.  From  a  playing  perspective,  what  are  the  most  important  aspects  of  a 3D game? Control.  You  have  to  have  good  control.  The  player  has  to  feel  like  the on-screen object is responding instantly to the inputs. For example, in one of the earliest 3D games we did, you were a turkey and you had to run around pecking control boxes well, we can’t even play it now because the controls seem so bad.  What aspects of 3D programming are the most constraining, e.g. texture size, model count, face count and effects? What enhancements would you like to see in 3D graphics technology? As computers and video cards get faster and faster the technical limitations become less of a factor.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 265  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  265  Good-looking 3D has an immediate appeal. Do you see it as the way for- ward in Web design, or just another tool? We see it more as a tool. There are many applications where 3D is great, but it is not the answer to everything. For example, on our site we thought about having a 3D interface for visitors to decide which game they want to play, but at the end of the day a more traditional approach of just a simple text list is the way to go.  What aspect of development would you say is the most time-consuming? The finishing touches on a game. Whether it is a client game, or an in-house game, it always seems to take forever to polish it up and package it.  Your future work Where do you see Ezone going? No plans to build the company any bigger, just increase revenue! Short- term goal is to find a major site sponsor so we can spend all our time devel- oping great 3D games for the site.   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 266  266  3D for the Web  How often do you plan to release a game?  Now that our game engine is pretty solid we would like to release at least one game a month  including client games .  Technique and production Did you find it hard adapting your 2D animation skills to 3D?  It was a little difficult, as 3D takes a different way of thinking.  But like any new application, spending time with the program  3ds max , pulling apart sample models and just experimenting helped to adapt.  The biggest challenge with the 3D models is keeping the poly count low. A typical character model is around 1000–1500 polys and a terrain we try and keep at around 5000–10,000.  On  average  how  many  animations walk  cycles  do  you  make  for  a  character? Usually at least 7: idle, walk, run, jump, drive, win happy, lose sad, how- ever other actions can include: swim, slide, swing, shuffle, push, falldown, surf, etc.  From a technical perspective, what’s more important, high quality graphics, or fast frame rate? Depends a lot on the gameplay. For example, a racing game that looks sharp, but has a slow frame rate and no sense of speed, is not going to appeal a gameplayer. We try to get a good balance.  What software do you use for creating your games? 3ds max for creating the models, Photoshop for the textures, Director for animated  sprites,  Soundedit  for  the  soundfx  and  music  mixing  and  3D Groove GX to put it all together.  Were there any specific problems you had to overcome during the production process? Probably the biggest challenge is working with cutting edge and beta software. Because 3D on the Web is still at the early adopter stage there are always going to be teething problems. However, when you are involved in a beta program you can be sure when the final version is released, all your games are going to work on it!   Chap-07.qxd  8 12 04  15:20  Page 267  Chapter 7 – Building virtual environments  267  Insights Do you have any advice for students of 3D game design? Keep games simple. If you can’t explain the game concept in one sentence, then it is too complicated. Make it intuitive so players can start off without any instructions, and then introduce challenges once you have hooked the player. But be careful, probably the hardest thing to judge is the pace of challenge and reward. If a Web game is too challenging players will just give up it’s not like a console game where they have invested $50 and they want value. The bigger the audience your game appeals to the better.  The amount of decent 3D Web games on the Web is still few and far between  excluding large download offline games and demos . Assuming this is just for technical reasons do you envisage there being a more integrated 3D Web presence than there currently is? 3D is only going to get bigger. It is almost like the web space is two or three generations behind what is happening in the console world, but we are catching up quickly.

We  have  covered  character  building  and  interaction,  imple- mented keyboard controls and built an environment, using a variety of meth- ods. This chapter builds further on this by introducing a variety of advanced techniques and tips that will aid the development of high-quality 3D games for Web usage. Creating a game is a very specific and individual task. Your game idea will be unique, as will the combination of methods you need to make it. This chapter takes a generic approach, by providing many options and techniques covering the various issues involved in game design and devel- opment. Practical examples, referred to by this chapter, are provided on this book’s accompanying CD. You can take apart these examples and use them for your own games. On the book’s website, www.3dfortheweb.info, you will see some of these examples as Shockwave files, integrated into the website. The website will also feature a full game, which this chapter refers to. It includes the characters from this book and many of the techniques discussed.  Marketing and financing You will have read the interviews in this book, many of which are from com- panies who view games as an important aspect to their website portfolio.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 270  270  3D for the Web  Games are a very useful marketing tool but can also be very complicated to create. Web games generally tend to be fairly simple games, akin to arcade  games.  Theoretically,  there  is  no  reason  why  they  cannot  be  as good as any professionally created game. The main obstacle is develop- ment time and expense. Time is money and the cost of development has to be balanced against the reward for making it. Many Web games are not sold, but given away, with the intention of retaining visitors to the site. It is the advertising money that finances these projects.  There are other ideas for the financing of the games, e.g. subscription. You could create the first level of a game and get your customers to purchase  further  levels.  Alternatively  you  might  make  the  game  available  only  by  paying a subscription and they would have to log on to play it. The main difference between this concept and that of purchasing the whole game is that the game could be fed to the player in parts. Each part of the world is only downloaded when they approach it, or when they have the password.  There are many factors involved in making a game, not least of which is individuality. It is not our intention to see thousands of clones of one game appearing  on  websites,  so  it  is  not  the  aim  of  this  chapter  to  take  you through the creation of one game. The purpose is to cover many of the tech- nical principles concerning 3D game development, incorporating the game elements supplied with the CD. This game will also appear on the book’s website in its finished form  www.3dfortheweb.info .  Planning Planning is a most important aspect of game design. Indeed, this holds true for any project where money is being spent on production. Assuming some- one is paying for your time, you will have to plan for the games develop- ment. You need to know whether you are capable of creating the whole game yourself, or whether you need a team of people to do it. You might need a separate graphic designer, programmer, 3D modeler and animator. In  the  game  industry,  it  is  often  the  case  that  the  programmer  does  not  do the modeling and set design, but works in a team of such people. The budgets for Web games are almost certainly going to be smaller, so you might not be able to afford to have a large team. This means that you need to be multi-skilled in order to complete the project.  If you have the skills to create a game completely by yourself, you will still need to plan your time. As a rough guide there are three stages to consider, the  design,  the  development  and  the  testing.  The  game  design  stage  is important as it is here that you will work out all the elements needed for your game, the characters, genre, storyline, scenario, interaction, aims, etc. This   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 271  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  271  will enable you to confidently develop the game without unexpected hitches. Once developed you will need time for testing; in a short project this might easily be a quarter of the time required for the games development. Never underestimate the importance of testing, as it is the chance to iron out all the bugs that your game will have. If you have a complex game then there will be many areas, such as object interactions, where errors can occur. No amount of planning can stop errors occurring in the first place, so you just need to allow time to fix them.  Only experience will help you plan properly, a game could take a few days to make, or many months. You will always improve your development time with the more games you make, speed and quality being the benefits of experience. Often with commercial projects there might be a time limit for delivery. This will influence you as to how complicated your game can be and how detailed the arena or world is. As long as you are aware of all the elements in your game and the experience of your team, then you will be in a good position to estimate the time needed, and hence the cost.  Game design Thorough game design will help you develop the game without encountering unexpected issues. You should be able to give your game design document to another team and for them to create the game without needing to ask any more  questions.  The  likelihood  is  that  the  team  will  be  involved  from  the  outset and this is good that you want to get other people’s opinions involved. It is the blueprint and it contains every little detail needed for production. Team members with different skills will pick up in different points.  There are various theories on what should go into a game design docu- ment. We will include some of them during the course of explaining all the technical elements needed to create your 3D game.  Genre  There are many genres relating to 3D games like shooter, simulation, adven- ture, sport, role-playing, flying, racing, strategy, puzzle, etc. They often cross with each other, e.g. a role-playing shooter. Most of these genres will have similarities like having to control a character. That character might not be human, it might be a car, a duck or a plastic toy, and may not be controlled by the player, but by the computer. Computer controlled characters  CCCs  are also known as mobiles. They may have a degree of artificial intelligence, all of which has to be programmed, with behaviors such as how they deal with object collisions, whether they react to you, the game player, etc.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 272  272  3D for the Web  Pacing in a game is often genre specific. A racing game needs to be non- stop action, but a shooter will create tension by having periods of low action, interspersed  with  shooting  mayhem  as  all  the  aliens  or  bad  guys  try  to attack you. All this needs to be planned. Building up tension during a game might be as simple as increasing the number of enemies that come to attack, or  shortening  the  time  limit  to  complete  a  task  or  adding  degrees  of  complication as you progress through the game.  Physical point of view To see your game you need to have a virtual camera. By default, just having the 3D view creates a camera. For a game you need to control that view, otherwise your character might run off the screen! There are a few ways to describe physical points of view, namely first person and third person.  First person view is where you become the character, as if you see through his or her eyes. Turning and running around moves the camera as if it is head  mounted.  There  is  not  much  complication  involved  in  using  a  first  person view. There is no need to model a character in this situation, but you might show the arms, or the weapon, if it is a run around and shoot game.  Third  person  view  is  also  known  as  over-the-shoulder.  Here  you  are  an observer of your character, as well as probably being the controller.  You see the character in all its detail with all of its movements and anima- tions.  It  is  perhaps  easier  to  identify  with  your  character  if  you  can  see  them and you can add many different movements to make them interesting  Figure 8.1 .  Using a third person view creates the significant issue of where to position the camera. The following section describes different ways to position the camera for this kind of view.  Fixed camera view  When deciding your camera style you should make reference to the use of cameras  in  film  making.  Terms  such  as  panning,  zooming,  wide-angle, close-up and tracking are just as relevant in games as they are in films. You might use a combination of camera movements and techniques to give your game a cinematic quality. It is possible to set up your camera to change position depending on where your character is. You can then make your camera  follow  an  object  as  it  moves  across  the  scene.  In  film  terms  this would be panning  turning the camera from side to side  and tilting  point   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 273  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  273  Figure 8.1 A third person point of view  the up and down . Following an object is easy in computer 3D. There are graphics commands to allow you to do this. In Director, the Lingo command is PointAt. You use this command by specifying which object you want the camera to follow.  Top Tip Directly following an object with a camera is not very natural. No real cameraman can keep up exactly with a person or object’s movement. There  is  always  a  slight  delay,  which  we  accept  as  being  natural. Likewise, no self-respecting cameraman changes the direction of their camera  with  sharp  movements,  but  they  would  use  smooth  motions. You can achieve this effect by using a dummy object. A dummy object is  an  invisible  object.  It  is  possible  to  make  the  dummy  constantly travel towards your target object.  Using the Lingo command InterpolateTo, you can make an object move towards another object. It is calculated in percentages, i.e. every frame of movement the dummy object would move towards its target object by 10% or whatever per- centage set. You then set the camera to follow the dummy object  Figure 8.2 .   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 274  274  3D for the Web  Dummy object   not normally visible   Figure 8.2 A camera tracking a dummy, which is following a game character. Inset with the camera view  Multiple cameras  When you use a fixed camera there is an obvious limitation that your char- acter might move too far away for it to be seen. So you need to set up many cameras in positions that allow you to view the action in the best way. This does not mean that you have to actually create many cameras; all you need to do is make a list of the positions of all the cameras. Then as the character gets near to that position the camera jumps to that position and then continues to follow it.  You could achieve this camera swapping by measuring the comparative dis- tances of camera to object and then always making sure that the camera moves to the nearest position. Calculations like these are quick to do, there is even a Lingo command, DistanceTo which does the measuring for you. Otherwise  you  would  have  to  use  trigonometric  math  to  work  out  the  distance from the world position coordinates of the cameras and object.  This method sounds fine in principle, and is if there are no objects in your scene that are blocking your view. Just because a camera happens to be nearest to your main character, does not necessarily mean that it has the best view. There is, however, another method you could use.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 275  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  275  You could create a map of your environment that is color coded to show which camera you want to use when the character is over certain areas. It is then possible to test the color of the map depending on the position of the character. For example, if the character is over the blue area then this could relate to the first camera, and red might mean camera two. You can use a simple rule like this to create a complicated camera setup that appears to intelligently select which camera to use. The color-coded map should take into account the camera angle and the amount that the camera can pan  Figure 8.3 . In the figure below black is used to indicate the objects in the  Figure 8.3 A camera position map, showing three cameras and their color codes, a character  marked by an x  and obstacles in black  scene. There need not be a rule to say what happens when the character walks over these areas. It should be impossible, as the character should bump into them. This is discussed in the collision section of the book.  Top Tip In films there is a camerawork rule known as ‘crossing the line’. You will  notice  in  Figure  8.3  that  the  cameras  are  all  positioned  on  one  side  of  the  stage.  This  is  done  purposely,  so  the  viewer  is  not  disoriented  by  camera’s  swapping  sides  and,  in  essence,  changing around your left and right. It is a good idea to try and abide by film making concepts, unless you feel you need to break the rules, or that you have no choice due to the game circumstances.  Single camera  The  most  commonly  used  camera  setup  is  just  to  have  one  camera  that tracks your character. Computers allow us to have a much more complicated   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 276  276  3D for the Web  system for a single camera than can be achieved in real life, so it is slightly ironic that this book is recommending following film camerawork methods. In a computer set a camera is not restricted by physics and can fly around, even passing through objects! Of course this is impossible in a real film set, but Directors have always tried to get as much flexibility out of a camera as possible, using cameras mounted on cranes, dollies and steadicams. In a computer game we do not need to set these up, but can make our camera follow our character, tracking through the environment.  There are a few particularly useful methods to achieve camera tracking in your 3D environment. When you use them in combination with each other a fairly sophisticated result can be achieved. The simplest method is to have the camera fixed to a position behind your target object and for it to be ori- ented  towards  that  target.  As  the  target  object  rotates,  then  the  camera swings around with it. Likewise as the target object moves around the envir- onment the camera follows it. However, this result is very dizzying. It does not take long to spin your character completely around which makes the camera swing around too. This method also means that you are always positioned exactly behind your character and hence cannot see what they are doing.  Note  This amount of camera movement is basically uncomfortable. Comfort is important when playing a game and if it is any good, people will be playing it for hours, so there is no need to give them a headache! This comfort factor is not just about eyestrain though, it is about helping the player accept the reality of the game situation. The more they accept it, due to good camera work, then the more they will play.  The way to overcome this swinging is to use more dummies. If you have a dummy immediately behind your character then you can make the camera travel toward  interpolate to  that dummy object. This way, the camera is not spinning around all the time, but smoothly tracking over your scene. This method can also be improved, as was the multiple cameras method, by ori- enting  towards  a  dummy  that  is  traveling  towards  the  object  you  are  controlling  Figure 8.4 .  Note  The dummy object in Lingo does not need to be a physical object. It can  just  be  a  transform.  A  transform  is  a  list  of  the  coordinates  for  position  and  orientation.  This  means  that  using  dummy  transforms does not negatively affect the performance of your game.  It is possible to increase the subtlety of camera movement. You may not want the camera to always be moving towards the character. For example, if he or she is running towards you, it would be better to track the camera   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 277  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  277  Dummy 2  fixed behind character   Camera travels towards Dummy 2  Camera points at Dummy 1  Dummy 1  travels towards character   Figure 8.4 Tracking camera using dummies as targets  backwards. You use a dummy that is positioned between you and the target object but it is always a set distance away from the target. You then tell your camera to travel towards this object as well as the dummy that is behind the character  Figure 8.5 .  Dummy 2  fixed behind character   Camera travels towards Dummy 2 and Dummy 3  Final position of camera  Dummy 1  Dummy 3  a fixed distance away from  the character and in a line with the camera   Figure 8.5 A tracking camera system that prevents the camera from getting too near the target   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 278  278  3D for the Web  To get your dummy to be in line with you and the target you should start by giving it the same coordinates as the target  duplicating its transform . Then orientate it towards the camera  using the PointAt command in Lingo  and finally move it forward by the desired amount of units  using the Translate command .  Top Tip You do not have to keep your camera moving all the time, particularly if you are only turning the character around. You could include a time delay, so the camera only tracks to a new position when the character has been stationary for a few seconds. Another idea is to only make the camera track towards the dummy object when the target is a cer- tain distance away, or only when it is moving forward. Combining the above camera systems with the multiple camera concepts can lead to a great degree of sophistication. This adaptable and controlled sys- tem, if done well, can make the player feel that the game has a good standard cinematography. You could even create your game to be in wide-screen format for a cinematic feel.  Avoiding objects  collision detection  Now we have made our cameras fly around our game world, we need to take into consideration the other objects in the scene, which are likely to get in  our  way.  The  two  issues  here  are  objects  that  obscure  our  view  and objects that the camera might bash into. Using the multiple camera idea can get around the objects obscuring our view, but it is not an answer to mov- ing cameras. We need to devise a system that can take into account the positions of objects and allow the camera to navigate around them; this is really collision avoidance.  Collision detection is a fundamental part of 3D game creation. Without it, your game will not feel solid, its plausibility will diminish and players will get bored far too quickly. Clearly you do not want your players to be able to  make  your  character  walk  through  walls,  unless  they  have  a  magic power  or  they  are  a  ghost!  Collisions  can  take  place  between  moving objects or between a moving and stationary object. It is possible for non- moving objects to ‘collide’ if one object is positioned in the same place  as another. This might happen if you are creating a world with randomly positioned objects.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 279  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  279  There is not really a difference between collision detection and avoidance. To make an object avoid a collision you need to know if it is going to col- lide with another object. This involves making a collision test which can be done either before the object has moved or afterwards. It is important to remember  that  your  objects  do  not  move  smoothly,  they  move  in  steps. These steps are changes in position that occur every frame, every time the screen is updated. The steps appear to be a smooth motion when the frame rate is high enough at approximately 25 frames per second or more.  There are many ways to detect when collisions have taken place but first  we  will  deal  with  the  moving  camera  and  collision  avoidance.  This  will introduce principles that we can reuse for other collision situations.  Coordinate collisions  The simplest of scenarios is that you have a rectangular arena, perhaps a football pitch and you want your characters to avoid running off the pitch. As you can easily track their coordinates in world space you can provide constraints to their positions. An example would be to have a pitch that was 1000  units  wide,  2000  units  long  and  positioned  in  the  center  of  your world. This means that one pitch ‘wall’ is located at the coordinate minus 500 in the X-axis and the opposite wall positioned at positive 500. So you can make a rule that states: If your object has moved to an X coordinate less than  cid:2  500 then changes its X position to  cid:2  500. This works for the oppos- ite wall by making the X position change to 500 if it is already greater  than 500 units. Likewise for the other two walls your rule would use the Z pos-itions  cid:2  1000 and 1000 as the walls are further away.  Casting a ray  A  very  common  situation  is  where  you  want  to  have  an  object  follow  a  terrain. In the case of our camera, we would want it to always be above  the ground, and not to crash into it. This is not a problem if our ground is flat, but if it is a terrain, as in the previous chapter, then our camera could easily move into the side of a hill. We can stop this happening by firing an imaginary line from the camera’s position vertically downwards  Figure 8.6 .  In Director there is a Lingo command for this called ‘ModelsUnderRay’. This command makes a list of the objects that are in the path of the ray. If no objects are in the path of the ray then the list is empty. But as we are assum- ing the ground will be beneath the camera, there should always be at least one object in the list. The ModelsUnderRay command does not just tell you that an object is in its path, it provides you with details such as the point on the model  in world coordinates  that the line intersected and the distance   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 280  280  3D for the Web  Ray is cast downwards   Point of intersection with the ground  Figure 8.6 Casting a ray vertically down to keep a camera above ground  between that point and the ray’s origin. It can also tell you the face number and the normal  the direction of the face is pointing . This can be used to provide a rebound direction if you want to bounce of the object.  In the case of our camera and the ground, we are only interested in the dis- tance from the origin of the ray. If we decide that we want our camera to be 300 units above the ground then we can cast a ray downwards, to get  the  vertical  position  of  the  terrain  at  the  point  of  contact,  and  then  add  300 units in the vertical direction  Y-axis  to that position.  Top Tip If you create objects in Director using Lingo, then it treats the Y-axis as being up. This is not the case for 3ds max which treats the Z direction as up. You need to be aware of this, otherwise your ray will not be pointing in the right direction. If you have a terrain that has been cre- ated in 3ds max then fire your ray with a direction vector of  0, 0,  cid:2 1 , this means negatively in the Z direction, as opposed to  0,  cid:2 1, 0 .  Other uses for ray casting  Ray casting is not just restricted to cameras and fixed distances. For a start you can use it to keep your character at a set distance above the ground.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 281  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  281  The Director example files supplied on this book’s accompanying CD use this method, at a slightly more complicated level. Instead of just keeping the Keystone Cop at a fixed distance above the ground, the character is kept at a height no less than that distance. The subtle difference is important as it allows  the  Keystone  character  to  jump  up  in  air  and  land,  with  his  feet apparently on the ground, as if they have collided.  The idea of having a minimum height above ground is also useful for any flying simulation, where you can have the freedom to fly an airplane or spaceship in all directions, unless it is too near the ground. In a futuristic  racing game, you could combine this idea with the traveling towards the point of contact plus a fixed distance. If your object is too low then, instead of jumping straight to the required height, you use the InterpolateTo com- mand to make it move towards it, perhaps by 30% at a time. This would have the appearance of a soft bounce, or an anti-magnetic response. The further that you had gone past the distance limit then the more you would be propelled back towards it, the greater the repulsion force.  Understanding vectors  You can cast a ray in any direction you like. This is not done using angles, but using a normalized vector. A vector coordinate might look something like vector  60, 20,  cid:2 80 . This corresponds to the x, y and z positions in world space, where vector  0, 0, 0  is the center of the world, also known as the origin. If you drew a line from the origin to the vector coordinate then it would have a length, this is also known as the magnitude. The magnitude of vector  60, 20,  cid:2 80  is 102 units.  Normalizing a vector means making its magnitude equal to 1. The resulting vector  then  describes  its  direction  only.  So  the  above  vector  normalized gives the result vector  0.59, 0.20,  cid:2 0.78 . Having a normalized vector allows you to do math on it, like finding the angles between two vectors, which is one reason it is useful.  So a position can be described in coordinates  x, y, z  or as a normalized vector   x,  y,  z   and  a  magnitude   any  number .  In  the  above  case,  the  pos-ition vector  60, 20,  cid:2 80  is equivalent to vector  0.59, 0.20,  cid:2 0.78  with a magnitude of 102.  Horizontal rays for collisions  In simple terms, in a 3D scene, if your camera view is aligned with the world  axes,  then  the  vector    cid:2 1,  0,  0   is  a  direction  pointing  left  and   1, 0, 0  is pointing right. Likewise  0, 0, 1  would be pointing away from   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 282  282  3D for the Web  the camera and  0, 0,  cid:2 1  would be pointing towards the camera. These are  all  vectors  in  horizontal  directions  and  we  can  use  them  to  detect whether our camera  or other object  is going to collide with other objects in our scene. In addition to firing a ray downwards, if you fire a ray in the four horizontal directions then they will possibly intersect with other objects.  You should set the ray lengths to be a particular number of units, perhaps  as  long  as  our  Keystone  Cop’s  arm,  then  you  will  know  whether  it  has  hit an object or not. If it has then you can tell the character  or camera   to  move  in  the  opposite  direction  by  the  amount  that  it  has  overlapped  Figure 8.7 .  If the character’s distance from a wall is below the minimum then the character is moved back to that distance  Rays are cast in four directions  Character’s final  direction of travel if too close to wall  Figure 8.7 Casting four horizontal rays to keep a character from walking through walls   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 283  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  283  Note  Setting the length of a ray with the ModelsUnderRay is not possible in versions of Macromedia Director previous to MX 2004. If you have an earlier version then you will have to use the distance measurement in the resulting list.  You could actually just use one ray pointing in the direction that your char- acter  or camera  is facing. When it hits a wall or object, you could use the direction of the intersected face to adjust your rotation. Firing another ray in the opposite direction to the wall’s face would allow you to measure the nearest distance from the wall. If you are too close then you could make sure you are a fixed distance away from the wall, perhaps 20 units.  Simple detection  Ray casting, as described above, is a very useful method to detect whether your objects are going to collide. It works particularly well for games which feature straight sides, like games that are set inside buildings, as there are only likely to a few directions that the walls might be facing. This method can cause problems when you are trying to stop more complicated objects from colliding, e.g. spherical or irregularly shaped objects.  There is a method that works for collisions with cylindrical objects, like trees. Instead of casting a ray, you just need to measure the distance from your character to the cylindrical object. If that distance is less than your desired amount, you move your character away from the object by the difference in distance.  This  works  particularly  well  when  two  spherical  or  cylindrical objects collide, e.g. pool balls.  To make this concept work you need to check the distances from your charac- ter  or camera  and all cylindrical objects. This is done best by making a list of these objects and cycling through that list, to see if any objects are too close.  The result of this collision detection method is that your moving object will smoothly move around the colliding object, whilst maintaining its previous trajectory  Figure 8.8 .  Mesh collisions  Perhaps the most accurate collision detection system is that of a mesh colli- sion.  This  is  where  the  mesh  of  one  object  is  compared  to  the  mesh  of another object and, if any parts of the mesh intersect, action is taken. In   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 284  284  3D for the Web  Distances are measured to centres of all objects  Character is positioned away from object if too close  Center of cylinder  Character continues to move in its direction of travel, but from a new position  Figure  8.8 Measuring  the  distances  to  objects,  for  cylindrical  shaped  collision detection  Director the Collision modifier takes care of this, by being assigned to your objects that you want to be treated this way. A straightforward use of this modifier is to ‘resolve’ the collision. This means that if both objects are mov- ing and they are set to be resolved, they are moved back to their last pos- ition before the collision took place. If only one of your objects is movable then you would only need to set this one to be resolved.  There are several properties that you can set with the Collision modifier. You do not have to resolve collisions via the shape of the mesh. It is possible to set it to detect collisions by a bounding sphere or bounding box. These are quicker methods than detecting proper mesh collisions, as there are fewer calculations to perform. If you are using the mesh mode for your collisions then detecting between two detailed meshes can significantly slow down your games frame rate performance. Using the bounding sphere is a bit like the simple detection method discussed in the previous section.  Usually, once a collision has taken place you will tell the object to perform an action. This could be based on the normal of the face of the object that it hit, e.g. moving the object in the direction of the normal.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 285  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  285  Note  It is not really advisable to use the mesh method for collisions on ani- mated complicated objects, such as moving characters. The performance of your game will slow down and you will have the added complica- tion  of  not  necessarily  wanting  to  move  your  whole  character  if  just  his hand has hit an object. It would be better to use a bounding box in this case.  Collision meshes  It is quite possible that you have a very complicated object in your scene that you want other objects to interact with it. As complicated meshes, with lots of vertices and faces slow down collision detection, one idea is to cre- ate a collision mesh. This is essentially a very low polygon version of your model that will be invisible  have a blend value of 0 . This can be grouped with your complicated object or linked as a child of it.  Top Tip Once you attach an object as the child of another  the parent , then it operates in local coordinates relative to that object and not in world coordinates.  Moving  child  objects  can  be  confusing  if  you  have  not realized  this  but  you  can  force  the  object  to  move  in  world  coordi- nates. In fact, the World is a parent of all objects so when you reposi- tion an object you are in fact moving it in its parent’s coordinates, i.e. the world coordinates.  If you have a lot of objects requiring collision meshes then it is advisable to try and reduce the number of objects needed. If these objects are stationary and positioned on the ground then you could create a mesh that covers all of them, as if they are shrink-wrapped. Remember that it is the number of objects in your world that has the biggest effect on the frame rate, so doub- ling the number by creating individual collision meshes may not be bene- ficial. Your computer actually runs through the whole list of objects every frame in order to detect collisions.  Collision maps  One  method  of  collision  does  not  involve  3D  at  all.  You  could  create  a  2D map of your scene, in a similar manner to the camera position map. This works particularly well for games with simple layouts, like rooms, corridors and  buildings.  In  fact  any  object  that  is  made  from  straight  lines,  e.g. parked cars in a street. The concept works by sampling the color of the   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 286  286  3D for the Web  image  map,  in  a  position  that  relates  to  the  horizontal  position  of  the  moving object.  There are two ways in which the map can be produced. The first would be to have a simple black and white map, with black representing objects and white representing space  Figure 8.9 . The object can only move in white space, so if it hits black then the object is returned to its previous position.  Figure 8.9 A simple black and white map for collision detection  In  Director,  you  use  the  Lingo  command  GetPixel  to  test  the  color  of  a bitmap image at a particular coordinate. If your world is large then your map would have to be detailed. The main advantage is that the testing for collision is simple no matter how many objects are in your scene.  One downside to using this technique is the possibility of getting stuck in your objects. If you bash into a wall at an angle then you do not want to stop still, you want to run along it. The previous method means you would stop still. The alternative to this is to have a more complicated color-coding system in your map. It has already been explained that this map idea works best for straight lines, in fact it works best of all for straight lines that align with the world axes, that is the X and Z directions. If you only have walls   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 287  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  287  that are at right angles to each other then we know that their Normals can only be facing one of four directions, analogous to north, south, east and west. You can color code your map so that a north-facing wall is blue, an east-facing wall, yellow, etc.  Having color-coded walls means that when your object collides with it, you need only move it back in one axis direction. For example, if east–west corres- ponds to the X-axis, hitting an east-facing wall would mean you return back to your X position, but your Z coordinate stays at its new one.

This means it is time to place these objects in our game. We need to design our world, devising what needs to be in it and where to put it. The previous chapter of this book covered many of the tech- niques needed to create an environment, but we did not cover accurate positioning of objects or some of the techniques required for buildings.  Naturally, what goes in your game world depends on what your game is about and where it is set. Perhaps you need some small village huts and stone walls for a fantasy adventure, or you might require many tall buildings combining to form a futuristic city. Either way we need to devise some effi- cient techniques in order to make our game suitable for the Web.  Do I need a world or an arena?  Answering this question is a crucial step in the approach we need to take for our game development. As you are probably aware, making games for the Web brings us certain limitations, mainly to do with file size. A full con- sole or PC game will be delivered on CD, or now DVD, and will often be  a huge game taking hundreds of hours to complete. As such it can measure hundreds of megabytes in amount of data. All this data includes the pro- gramming,  the  textures,  sounds  and  music,  3D  models,  and  video  clips   cut-scenes .  A game of this size might take hours to download  even with a Broadband connection  and what you want is a game that loads in minutes or better still seconds. You cannot expect your site visitors to wait around for ages whilst a game loads, unless you already have a reputation that your games are worth the wait. This leaves us with a few options. Either we have a small game, set in an arena, or a larger game that loads gradually. A larger game might contain many small levels, as you complete one you wait for the next to load. Your players will hopefully be happy to wait, as they are lured deeper and deeper into your playing experience. Alternatively, you might have a large world that you will need to load up gradually as the game player explores it. This might involve pauses in the game play, or the game might actually load all the time, whilst it is being played.  If you decide to have a single level arena then you will need to decide what kind of arena it will be. If you have martial arts fighting game then it might only be a small area of land, or a boxing ring. You might need some sur- rounding  buildings,  and  objects  setting  the  scene,  perhaps  an  alleyway with trashcans, and a burnt-out vehicle. In this situation you are not talking about hundreds of objects and there is unlikely to be any cloning needed. It makes sense to create this scene entirely in your 3D package, and then import it in to Director to create the interaction, setting up the collision detection.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 289  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  289  Top Tip Pitching your game to the right level of computer is a crucial issue. If you make it so that it can only run on the latest and greatest computer then you will be alienating a majority of your audience. You need to be  efficient  in  your  use  of  textures  and  number  of  objects,  without compromising on quality. Be aware of the objects in your scene and decide a minimum specification of computer that you want the game to  work  well  on  and  test  it  on  that  computer.  Older  graphics  cards need  a  lot  more  consideration  than  the  latest  with  tons  of  memory available  and  super-fast  rendering  capabilities.  Minimum  specifica- tion changes all the time, so if you are not sure what specifications to go for then look at the back of computer games packaging. That will give  you  the  best  guide  to  what  the  professionals  currently  think  is acceptable.  Game object creation  In the chapter on building a character for a Shockwave; the Keystone Cop, you have covered probably the most complicated build for a game. A char- acter is going to be scrutinized more than any other object in your scene.  It is he  or she  that you will be looking at for the most time, so a careful  balance between complexity of design and simplicity of building is needed. Overall we need to make our objects as simple as possible, in order to maintain a decent frame rate, whilst making them believable. Maintaining a  frame  rate  involves  low-poly  modeling,  and  making  them  believable means good quality textures. You will use textures to imply physical detail where there is only really a flat triangle. For example, in our Keystone Cop character, his eyes are not separate objects, but created with the texture  that covers his whole head. If the textures are created well then your players will not even think about the illusion you have created. A common object in a game would be a wall. Indeed, these form part of the set in classic shooting games like Doom, Quake, etc. It will be a useful exer- cise to create a simple walled building layout, a dungeon or castle perhaps.  Making a walled dungeon  The first stage of building a set for a game should be to draw some kind of diagram, a map or blueprint. This is best done on graph paper or in an illus- tration program with grids turned on. This can be done simply at first, by blocking out rooms and corridors, assuming that that is what you want in your game  Figure 8.11 . You might find this easier to do in a program like Adobe Illustrator. You can import the vector shapes from Illustrator into 3ds max and   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 290  290  3D for the Web  Figure 8.11 An Adobe Illustrator sketch for a dungeon blueprint  use them to create your building. Alternatively you can use your 3D packages Spline drawing options. This will enable us to use a simple structure for our building. Ideally, we create our building as one object, with relatively few polygons. This will be very useful from the frame rate efficiency aspect and we can always increase the complexity by adding details with other objects.  Top Tip Although our map is rough, there are some points to note about it that are important. There is always a gap between each room; this is set to the size of the grid, as the rectangles are snapping to the grid. This gap is important, as the walls will only be visible on one side. This is a  real  time  rendering  issue  as  any  plane  can  be  rendered  on  both sides or just the front or back. Rendering on just the front means that half the amount of triangle needs to be rendered, hence it is twice as quick to complete the task.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 291  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  291  Our map is at a sketch stage. You can manipulate the rooms until you have a desired layout. When you are satisfied it is time to make the actual walls. Remember that we want to create the whole building out of one object. You can do this by tracing two lines around the shapes of your rooms, this results in a shape that we can use as a template in 3ds max  Figure 8.12 . It is rec- ommended that you save your Illustrator file as a Version 8.0 file as this is more compatible with 3ds max. When you import it, make sure you select Single Object, and not Multiple. You should then scale it up until it fits a coordinate scale that you are happy with, perhaps equivalent to 40 meters across or 4000 units.  Figure 8.12 An Adobe Illustrator map made out of two vector shapes  Note  Getting your scale correct is essential at this stage, as everything in your world will relate to this. I recommended that you align your ‘blue- print’  to  the  grid  in  your  3D  package.  This  should  make  it  easier  to place objects and make sure they align with the walls, without gaps. A staircase would be one such example.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 292  292  3D for the Web  Now you have an outline of your building, all you need to do is import it into your 3D program and use the Extrude modifier to make the walls the height that you require. Of course this is a very simple structure, and you might want a more complicated design. Perhaps you want windows or dif- ferent thicknesses of walls. It is at this stage that you should implement these design details.  Making windows  This is not a very difficult task to do, particularly when you should have already modeled a character earlier in the book. Essentially, all you need to do is mark off where you want the windows and then extrude them into your wall.  Select the Spline shape that you have imported and open up the Modifier Stack to select vertex editing. Then choose the Refine button. This will allow you plot extra vertices on your Spline shape. You need to place them on either side of where you want window to be or on both sides of the wall  Figure 8.13 . Make sure that the outer wall vertices align with the inner wall vertices.  Once  you  have  marked  all  the  windows  you  need,  you  can  add  the  Extrude  modifier.  When  you  do  so,  make  sure  you  have  at  least  three   Figure 8.13 Adding four vertices at the bottom of your Spline shape in prepar- ation for creating a window   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 293  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  293  segments selected, but not many more as you do not need the extra poly- gons.  Now  add  an  Edit  Mesh  modifier  and  select  Polygon  from  its  sub- menu. Click on your window polygon and extrude it negatively, punching  a  hole  in  the  wall.  Only  extrude  it  as  far  back  as  the  wall  is  thick   Figure 8.14 .  Figure 8.14 Extruding a window out of the mesh  To finish it off, you should delete the polygon that you have extruded and the one on the outer wall. Then select Edit Mesh  cid:3  Vertex and align the loose vertices from the inner wall window with the four corners of the outer wall  window.  When  they  are  aligned  you  can  choose  Weld  cid:3  Selected from the Edit Geometry menu to join them together. This will fix any gaps in the geometry of your wall.  Now we have made our simple dungeon, you can start to make it look more interesting. Add a floor and a ceiling using planes that cover the entire area of your building. You could start to add more details, such as more objects in your rooms. Exactly what you need depends entirely on what kind of building  you  have,  perhaps  a  dungeon,  a  futuristic  building,  an  office   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 294  294  3D for the Web  block, etc. When building your objects keep them simple; it is in the textures that the details will show.  If you have more than one floor in your building then use a box for each floor as you will need the thickness. You will then have the issue of how to travel from floor to floor. Perhaps you will have a lift to travel up or perhaps a staircase on the outside of your building. Most likely, your stairs will be in one of the rooms, so you will have to punch a hole in the floor to let your characters go through. Make sure you allow for this by creating enough  vertices in your floor mesh, so that you can extrude a hole.  Making a texture  Now you have made your building you need to give it a convincing mater- ial. It is always best to make up your own textures,  although it is possible to buy them or download them for free on the Internet . These might come from photographs, as discussed in the previous chapter. In the case of our dungeon, we require a stone wall. The chances of you finding a suitable dungeon style wall are slim, but you could use your 3D package to create the  texture  you  require,  e.g.  stone  bricks.  One  advantage  to  making  up your own texture is that you can have accurate control over the lighting so that you get a decent depth to your texture; also you get to decide the size, shape and color of your bricks.  To make a wall you need some brick shapes, so you should start a new file, as you are only doing this exercise in order to create a texture. These can be as complicated as you like, but I recommend you to choose a chamfered box shape, as opposed to a normal box. This is important as you will get a highlight on the edges when the box is chamfered, this adds to the realism. In real life most edges are always rounded, just look around you to see what I mean. If you want your bricks to be irregular then add a Noise modi- fier or Mesh Edit to them. You may not want to do this though, as we are going to make up a repeating pattern for use on our walls and your irregu- lar bricks might stand out as they become part of a pattern.  Assemble your wall to your desired brick or tile pattern. You might want to push some of the bricks slightly backward and forward, if you want an old style wall  Figure 8.15 . Now attach them together as one object using the ‘Connect’ compound object. This will treat the object as one so that you can apply a texture to the whole set of bricks and not just to each individual brick. This way all of your bricks can appear slightly different, as if they have been weathered or had moss growing on them.  If you want your bricks to appear chiseled, use a Noise modifier as a Bump map and set the size of the Noise to a low value. If you want a more natural   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:22  Page 295  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  295  Figure 8.15 An assembled brick wall, made from chamfered boxes  looking  stone  then  use  another  Noise  map  for  the  Diffuse  Channel,  and choose some texture bitmaps for the Noise colors. In the Figure 8.15 two different photographs were used and blended together by using them as the Noise colors. Ideally you could find some stone and take a photograph; perhaps you could even go to your local carpet store and use some marble effect patterns. If you want your bricks to appear slightly damp then adjust the specular and glossiness curves to give them a slight shine. When you are happy with your stone material, place a light that points down, to simulate the most common type of light that will appear on the building. Do not use an Omni or Point light, but use a directional light as this will give you an even spread of light. Make sure you turn the shadows on, as this will provide the depth you require. Finally, render your picture in the front view and not the perspective. This will give you a flat image that you can use for tiling  Figure 8.16 . You might want to add in another box to represent the mortar in between the bricks. The next stage would be to use a program like Adobe PhotoShop to cut out your rendered image and making it into an image that can be tiled.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 296  296  3D for the Web  Figure 8.16 An assembled brick wall, rendered for use as a texture  Applying the texture to your building  You can make the task of applying your brick texture simple by using a UVW map modifier, set to Box wrap and tiling it as many times as is nec- essary. This will place your new wall material over the entire building, and make it map correctly for box directions of walls. However, if your walls are not placed at right angles to each other, then this box wrapping method will give stretched results. In this case you should apply the Material to indi- vidual walls.  You can always use the Multi-Sub-Object Material to place different textures onto different walls. This way you can create a lot more variety, like making window surrounds, or details like door opening panels in a futuristic building.  Top Tip Always remember when texturing to use the UVW map modifier, or the UVW  unwrapper   as  used  earlier  in  the  book  when  building  the Keystone  Cop .  The  UVW  modifiers  are  responsible  for  the  texture coordinates when you export your scene as a .w3D Shockwave file. If you have not applied the modifiers then your textures may not appear correctly wrapped. Do not use the tiling options within the Materials, but tile textures from the UVW map modifier.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 297  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  297  Shadows  In a real time game environment shadows are very complex thing to calcu- late. This in turn will reduce your frame rate to unacceptably low levels. Real time shadows are possible in commercial games as they can take advan- tage  of  new  technologies  in  graphics  cards,  but  the  Shockwave  engine  cannot do this, as yet.  Another issue with real time shadows is that they tend to be hard edged which is not always the desired effect. In real life, the shadow from a light bulb is not going to be hard edged, but will be softer the further the shadow is from the object. This effect can be achieved in a properly rendered scene using area shadows or shadow mapping, and it would be good to incorp- orate subtle lighting into our building. This will lend a greater sense of realism to our rooms.  Top Tip It  is  still  a  good  idea  to  have  a  shadow  on  your  character  in  your game.  This  of  course,  is  a  moving  shadow.  A  simple  and  effective  technique is to have a Plane object that is set to follow the ground at the  feet  of  your  character.  This  plane  can  be  oriented  to  match  the direction of the face of the ground that it is on. If this plane has soft, round texture applied to it  with alpha transparency  then you get the appearance of a soft, round shadow. This is not perfect, but does help provide solidity to your character. Figure 8.1 shows a shadow under the Keystone character.  Texture baking  Texture  baking  is  used  to  create  materials  that  appear  to  have  lighting effects like shadows on them. Essentially it involves rendering the scene in your 3D package, with all the lighting, shadows and material effects set. This rendering is only done on the objects that you want baked.  3ds  max  has  a  texture  baking  option  under  the  Rendering  cid:3  Render  to Texture menu. This enables you to render complicated shapes and store the Texture Coordinates automatically. This can be a very useful feature as you can have effects like Raytraced reflections on objects that you would not be able to achieve in a real time situation.  In the case of our Dungeon, first of all make sure you have set up all the lighting that you want in your scene. This will be as many lights as you   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 298  298  3D for the Web  would expect to have in all of your rooms. Then you just need to select your floor  or wall or ceiling  and choose the Render to Texture option. Next you add the maps that you want to render. For simplicity, choose to render the Complete Map. This will create a texture that you can use to replace the floor material that you previously had. This material will have all the shadows and lighting changes that you require. You can then repeat the concept for any other objects that you want to be shadow mapped. This works best on flat planes but applies to more modeled objects as well. You have to remem- ber that you will lose some detail on your floor texture if it was made from a  previously  tiled  material.  Now  your  texture  will  cover  the  entire  floor  Figure 8.17 .  Figure 8.17 A texture baked floor with lighting and shadows  Rendering to a texture automatically generates UVW coordinates, so it is not necessary to apply a UVW map modifier.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 299  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  299  Top Tip When you render to texture, select Map Channel 1 before you actually render  in the Render to Texture palette . The problem with Render to Texture is that it creates a Shell material, which cannot be exported to Shockwave. To get your new baked texture to work, you should create a  new  material  with  the  Diffuse  map  set  to  be  the  bitmap  that  the Render to Texture function has created. You will be able find this in the Material Editor list, when you set the Diffuse map. You have to select Map Channel 1 when rendering in order for this new material to work, when exported to Shockwave. The default value  map channel 3  does not  work   bear  in  mind  that  this  process  was  not  designed  just  for Shockwave 3D . Also as your texture has lighting on it, you can set the Materials Self-Illumination value to 100. This will mean it will be prop- erly visible and will not rely on lighting when you have exported it.  Exporting your world  When you export your building you might have some large textures created from texture baking. It is here that you will have to compromise between detail and overall file size. You can set the compression value of textures in the Export window. This uses JPEG compression and so it can significantly reduce the size but it is at the expense of quality, so a balance will have to be found through experimentation.  The  finished  building  can  be  imported  into  Director  and  then  used  in  conjunction with your collision routines to create a navigable experience  Figure 8.18 .  Assembling a game Games are not just about a virtual reality tour, they have to have a purpose, a reason for playing them. Obviously your game needs an aim, e.g. shoot as many monsters as you can, or collect all the parts of a golden talisman. Your game might have a scoring system, or it might be a race against time or a combination of both. There might be objects to collect that aid you on your way to completing the game, objects that restore your health or give you greater weapons. Either way we need to include other objects in the game, and we also want to keep in mind the fact that it is for Web publi- cation, hence keeping an eye on download size.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 300  300  3D for the Web  Figure 8.18 The dungeon in Shockwave form with baked textures on the floor and ceiling  Using a map to generate objects  We have already used graphical maps to plan and create our worlds. We can also use them as a way to position objects in our world. This is useful in situations where you might have an object that is repeated a lot, e.g. the power pills in a 3D Pacman game. Ideally, when you create your environ- ment in your 3D package, you only create one of each object. You can then clone them many times in Director, in runtime. This was done in the previous chapter to create trees, but in that case they were positioned randomly. We can use a map to mark the positions of objects using color coding.  All you need to do is have a scale map of your environment and mark on different  colors  to  represent  the  positions  of  your  objects.  In  the  case  of Figure 8.19, the map shows an Island with the dark pixels representing the positions of coconuts. In this case they are actually red pixels, or in Lingo terms, the colors red, green and blue  RGB   255,0,0 . When you set up the game, the  program  scans  the  map  image  row  by  row,  using  the  Lingo GetPixel command. If it finds a red pixel it positions coconut in the world at   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 301  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  301  Figure 8.19 A 128 by 128 pixel map  enlarged , for positioning objects  a point relative to the map, scaled up. Each coconut is actually positioned well above the ground and a ModelsUnderRay command is used to check the height of the ground below it. Then each coconut is moved to the appro- priate height position.  The coconuts are intended to be collected or drunk by being bashed by the Keystone Cop’s truncheon. As well as positioning you can set these objects to be responsive to collisions.  Bashing  Shooting something is very common in games, but in this case, we bash with the truncheon instead of shooting. Usually shooting involves concepts of firing a ray from the position of the character and checking to see if it has hit another character. This is actually quite a straightforward task; it is the   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 302  302  3D for the Web  same principle as keeping the camera and other objects above the ground, or as used in collision detection. However, the process is different in the case of the Keystone character. We require a very specific collision, that of his truncheon and a coconut.  In the case of our Keystone guy, his truncheon has been made to be part of the single mesh that makes him up. This is fine for him, but if you have a character that needs to change weapons or items then this is not appropri- ate. Another issue this leaves us with is that we cannot detect whether an object  has  hit  just  the  truncheon,  we  can  only  detect  collisions  with  the whole mesh. To overcome this you can attach objects to the bones of the character.  Attaching an object to the bones system is not like grouping it or adding the object as a child of the bone. The bone system is part of the Bonesplayer modifier in Director. As such you cannot add a child object to it, but you can find out the positions of the bones. Their positions are relative to the mesh object, so then it is just a case of taking into consideration the position of the mesh. If you do this test each frame, you can get an up-to-date transform  the transform being the position and direction  for a specific bone and then make your object’s transform the same as the result.  In the case of our Keystone Cop, we have attached a box to his truncheon  Figure 8.20 . This is what is used to collide with the coconuts. Although  visible in the picture, this box’s Shader Blend value will be set to zero in the game. That way, you cannot see it, but it is still doing its job.  Exploding  In most games, after you shoot or bash something you want to see a reac- tion, otherwise it is not satisfying. If you fire a laser at an oncoming space- ship then you want to see it explode. This can be achieved by playing a short animation of an explosion: a few dozen frames each with alpha trans- parent backgrounds, so that the flames and smoke merge into the back- ground. Another, more versatile, concept is to use a particle system.  Particle systems in real time graphics are actually primitive objects  like the box, sphere, cylinder , but they do not operate in the same manner. They are made out of Planes  as many as you set up  which always face the camera. They are motion objects in that you set up how they move  e.g. direction and speed  and how forces affect them, like gravity and drag  friction . You can  make  the  motions  follow  paths  or  cover  an  area,  but  the  usual  use  for them is to have a stream of particles emanating from a point. The two options are a Stream motion or a Burst motion. The Stream option is used to   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 303  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  303  Figure  8.20 A  box  attached  to  the  truncheon  for  collision  detection  with  the coconuts  simulate flowing, like a waterfall, or smoke rising from a campfire and even the fire itself. The Burst option is what we want with our coconuts, an explo- sion of particles lasting for a short while and flying out from a single point.  To achieve the effect of an exploding coconut, we need to first detect the  collision between the truncheon and coconut. Then create a particle system in the coconut’s position and delete the coconut object. The particle system needs to have a texture set for it  with an alpha transparent background  to  hide  the  square  shape  of  the  particle   and  the  speed,  size,  gravity,  angle of particle emission values set. To add a bit of variety, two particle systems  have  been  created  to  give  two  different  broken  coconut  shapes  Figure 8.21 .   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 304  304  3D for the Web  Figure 8.21 The particle system used for a coconut explosion  Scoring and overlays  Scoring  is  a  very  important  part  of  any  game  as  it  is  probably  the  main motivation for playing it more than once. You may want your game players to come back and improve their score; this creates more visits to your website, which will hopefully lead to more revenue. You might even offer  an  extra  incentive  to  play,  like  a  prize  for  the  highest  score  by  a  certain date.  In  programming,  a  score  is  stored  in  a  variable,  which  is  increased  or reduced as time passes or events happen, such as collecting items. Displaying the score, or time, for your game can be achieved through several methods. You could just use a text field that is positioned above or below your 3D window. This method is fine but you probably want to make your 3D experi- ence all encompassing, perhaps even filling up the whole screen.  Note  You cannot display anything over the top of your 3D window without substantially reducing the frame rate of your game. 3D graphics are dis- played in a hardware mode that means normal graphics like pictures and  text  are  handled  separately.  You  would  have  to  use  a  software mode if you wanted to overlay graphics in this manner, which means the dedicated 3D hardware in your graphics card would not be used.   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 305  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  305  Another method would be to use 3D text. You can create 3D text using any font, and then display that in your 3D window. Position the text by using the camera screen coordinates, this will allow you to keep the score’s charac- ters’ positions relative to the 3D window dimensions, positioning in 2D. You could texture 3D text to give it the look you want.  The last method would be to use camera overlays. This is the only way to incorporate bitmap images over the top of your 3D scene. You can use it for text by image copying from a set of characters to another bitmap, and then using that bitmap as an overlay texture. Using overlays does not have to be for text alone, you could use it to give your game an irregular border, or add other graphics such as maps to it  Figure 8.22 .  Figure 8.22 Using overlays for the score and a map   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 306  306  3D for the Web  Computer controlled characters  Computer controlled characters  CCCs  have only been mentioned briefly so far, but are an integral part of nearly all games. A CCC can be any kind of object or character that does something in your game but is not under your control. It could be argued that the coconuts are computer controlled. Indeed they are positioned by the program and then react to the Keystone Cop’s truncheon, by way of exploding. However, this interaction is very simple and they do not move.  A more useful definition of a CCC would be a character that is trying to obstruct you in your game task. Ten years ago you could have used bitmaps to make these characters, as was successfully done in games like Doom, using the same techniques we have for trees. If you have hundreds of char- acters then you might still have to use this technique. One thing you could do to make your characters look better would be to animate the texture used for the plane. That way you could achieve the appearance of motion, e.g. flailing arms for zombies.  It would be fair to say that today’s game player will not be impressed by 2D characters in your 3D world, unless it suited the game. Perhaps it has a car- toon style, as if the characters are paper cutouts. This would lend itself very well to bitmaps. Other than that, you will probably have to create 3D characters. Of course this will have an effect on your development time, but you could always use the same character in different clothes, or, more correctly, dif- ferent textures. Indeed, once you have created one character, it does not mean you have to start from scratch to make more.  Using 3D CCCs in your game has a lot of similarities with your main game character. In fact, the only conceptual difference will be the decision mak- ing for where he or she moves. Other than that you will have the same issues to deal with inside your game, namely the collision and animation handling.  Controlling the characters  On of the simplest methods to control your CCCs would be to make them follow a repeating path, like the spaceships in the classic Space Invaders game, or a more complicated path. Perhaps your character is an enemy soldier  guarding  a  gate;  you  could  set  up  a  list  of  positions  for  him  to    Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 307  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  307  follow. When it reached one position it turned towards the next one and walks towards it. This sounds quite simple, but you still would have to take into account the animation for that character. The main issue with it is that the movement will be predictable. This might be a good thing, as it allows you a chance to run past the character. There might only be a small window of opportunity, too late or too early and your character is killed.  Another simple method would be to control the direction the CCC is point- ing, either slightly every frame, or by deliberate amounts at certain inter- vals. In essence, this is same as following a path. But you could add some unpredictability by having the direction changes occur at random times or amounts. This might work for an open arena type of game, but will prob- ably only create an increase in the difficulty level, where you have so many characters that avoiding them takes great skill.  Using rules to control the characters  You can build up a sophisticated type of control through the combination of rules. We already have rules for our main character, he can walk and jump, depending on keystrokes. We make the decisions for that, but other rules have an effect on him, like gravity and collisions. These rules make the char- acter come down to earth when he is jumping and stop him falling through the ground. If you give our CCCs these rules, then you are on the way to building a type of artificial intelligence. The next rule to make would be the motivation for moving. We have talked about paths, but you could make your CCCs home in on your main character, by pointing towards him and moving  forward.  You  could  make  this  happen  only  when  they  within  a  certain range of the main character.  Combining  rules  together,  results  in  your  computer  controlled  characters behaving in a seemingly natural manner, and possibly even giving the illu- sion of making decisions. If you increased the complexity of the rules then they actually could make decisions, although whether they are intelligent is debatable. You could add a rule that took into account where you are trav- eling and the CCC could get there first to block you from your goal, an anticipatory behavior.

All this would be intended for today’s audience on today’s computers. But what of the future of 3D on the Web? The answer is linked inextricably to the future of the internet itself. The internet is still young with the World Wide Web starting in the early nineties. In the time since then it has developed in its sophistication, but is not much dif- ferent in terms of what it shows in a browser – text, link buttons and graphics  and sometimes sound . So if the concept has not changed much, then what has? Well, for a start, the net is diversifying. No longer do you have to sit at a computer to view a web page. You can look at it on your mobile phone or PDA. The mobile use of the Web is a crucial subject, and one which brings its own  design  challenges.  For  a  start,  screen  resolutions  are  much  lower  on   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 309  Chapter 8 – Making a 3D game  309  these devices than on a desktop monitor. 3D may not be very popular yet on mobiles, but bandwidth is more of an issue, so being able to display real-time 3D graphics could be a much better way to advertise a product.  The way people use the Web is changing our lives, after all, how many  people booked holidays online ten years ago, compared to now? Today, you know you can find a bargain online, so it is the first place to visit. You can even buy a home through the Web. There are so many opportunities for 3D to enhance a Web situation. 3D could easily come to dominate the net market in the way that it has for television graphics.  As broadband becomes more standard and machines more powerful we should see 3D for the Web follow the way of 3D in commercials and fea- tures. When this happens, my hope is that designers and clients will not be tempted to pursue the holy grail of realistic rendering, but will instead keep searching for creative solutions to the interactive format. Tomas Landgreen, co-founder of Titoonic, tells how he was instantly attracted to interactive 3D, rather than the high-end world of the big 3D houses. He wanted to ‘do the fun parts: the concept, the character designs, the animation and the story- telling.’ He is pointing out a crucial difference the current restrictions make on the designer: They actually force designers to be more creative.   I have a reputation amongst my students for wearily dumping on their realis- tic renders by saying, ‘Yeah, yeah. It’s great, but why bother to animate it?’ As I said before: Animation is hard work, it is also magic. Why throw away the fun stuff? With animation and design there are well established principles drawn from centuries of other art forms. If a theatre designer needs to evoke a wood for Midsummer Night’s Dream he or she will happily suggest the lover’s forest with some lights and a gobo. The audience does not expect or want an Athenian Wood to be shipped in and put on stage. It is more fun to solve problems creatively than to throw money at a poor imitation of life. David Hockney said that ‘A painting gives you so much more than a photo- graph’. He is right. Just because interactive 3D is an immersive media, does not mean we have to try and recreate the world Matrix-style. I truly believe that for 3D on the Web, less is more.  One of the questions we asked several of the companies in this book was which technology do they think is best for 3D. Although they all gave answers, perhaps the question should not be which is best, but which is the most popu- lar.  Take  the  old  Betamax  versus  VHS  situation  in  the  early  days  of  home video. Betamax was considered to be a better format, a better picture, but VHS was the best distributed, had the most rental movies. It won the contest due  to  better  marketing.  This  is  probably  the  case  for  Macromedia  and Shockwave. Whether it is the best for 3D, or not, is perhaps irrelevant. The point is that it is the most popular and best marketing platform for displaying 3D, whether through its Flash player or the Shockwave player. Macromedia’s dominance has left other companies struggling to get a foot hold on the Web   Chap-08.qxd  8 12 04  15:23  Page 310  310  3D for the Web  market. Whichever software dominates, you need to be flexible enough to adapt with the times. Which software you use is not important; it is the ideas you have that will help you gain work and recognition as a 3D Web master.  So don’t just run through the exercises in this book, make up your own. Add your own ideas and explore the possibility of 3D. It is with you that the future of 3D on the Web lies, so go and create it.   Appendix  8 12 04  15:26  Page 311  Appendix  Software To use this book successfully you’ll need software.
