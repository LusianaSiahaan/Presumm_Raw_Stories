For those who were unaware, we share the same birth- day  although he’s much older than me, at least one full year , and we  meet up at least once each year and congratulate ourselves for making  it another year. It’s also funny how Microsoft “reboots” its technology  every ten years or so, and now, revisiting the foreword I wrote ten years  ago, nothing much has changed—I’m still hip-deep in a new Microsoft  technology, but this time it’s all about WinRT and Windows 8, rather  than .NET. One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the need for  carefully planned and executed database design. Nothing Mike wrote  in his original volume has changed very much, and although this  new edition modifies some details, the basics of good database design   haven’t changed in the ensuing ten years. I must confess a little jeal- ousy that Mike has written a book with such enduring shelf life, but, if  he’s going to have a book that succeeds for this many years, at least it’s  a good one. Whether this is your first visit to Mike’s detailed explana- tion of database design, or your second or third, be assured that you’ll  find a carefully considered, helpful path through the vagaries of data- base design here. But let’s get past the intro, and get to work!  —Ken Getz, November 14, 2012   From the Second Edition . . .   I don’t see Mike Hernandez as much as I used to. Both our profes- sional lives have changed a great deal since I ﬁrst wrote the foreword  to his original edition. If nothing else, we travel less, and our paths  cross less often than they did. If you’ll indulge me, I might try to add  that the entire world has changed since that ﬁrst edition. On the most   xxi   xxii  Foreword  mundane level, my whole development life has changed, since I’ve  bought into this Microsoft .NET thing whole-heartedly and full-time.  One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the constant need for data,  and well-designed data. Slapping together sophisticated applications  with poorly designed data will hurt you just as much now as when  Mike wrote his ﬁrst edition—perhaps even more. Whether you’re just  getting started developing with data, or are a seasoned pro; whether  you’ve read Mike’s previous book, or this is your ﬁrst time; whether  you’re happier letting someone else design your data, or you love doing  it yourself—this is the book for you. Mike’s ability to explain these con- cepts in a way that’s not only clear, but fun, continues to amaze me.   —Ken Getz, October 10, 2002   From the First Edition . . .   Perhaps you’re wondering why the world needs another book on data- base design. When Mike Hernandez ﬁrst discussed this book with me,  I wondered. But the fact is—as you may have discovered from leaﬁng  through pages before landing here in the foreword—the world does  need a book like this one. You can certainly ﬁnd many books detailing  the theories and concepts behind the science of database design, but  you won’t ﬁnd many  if any  written from Mike’s particular perspec- tive. He has made it his goal to provide a book that is clearly based  on the sturdy principles of mathematical study, but has geared it  toward practical use instead of theoretical possibilities. No matter what  speciﬁc database package you’re using, the concepts in this book will  make sense and will apply to your database-design projects.   I knew this was the book for me when I turned to the beginning of  Chapter 6 and saw this suggestion:   Do not adopt the current database structure as the basis for the new  database structure.    Foreword  xxiii  If I’d had someone tell me this when I was starting out on this data- base developer path years ago I could have saved a ton of time! And  that’s my point here: Mike has spent many years designing databases  for clients; he has spent lots of time thinking, reading, and studying  about the right way to create database applications; and he has put it  all here, on paper, for the rest of us.   This book is full of the right stuff, illustrated with easy-to-understand  examples. That’s not to say that it doesn’t contain the hardcore infor- mation you need to do databases right—it does, of course. But it’s  geared toward real developers, not theoreticians.   I’ve spent some time talking with Mike about database design. Over  coffee, in meetings, writing courseware, it’s always the same: Mike is  passionate about this material. Just as the operating system designer  seeks the perfect, elegant algorithm, Mike spends his time looking for  just the right way to solve a design puzzle and—as you will read in  this book—how best to explain it to others. I’ve learned much of what  I know about database design from Mike over the years and feel sure  that I have a lot more to learn from this book. After reading through  this concise, detailed presentation of the information you need to know  in order to create professional databases, I’m sure you’ll feel the same  way.   —Ken Getz, MCW Technologies  KenG@mcwtech.com     This page intentionally left blank    Preface  Life, as the most ancient  of all metaphors insists, is a journey . . . —JONATHAN RABAN, FOR LOVE AND MONEY  Paths may change and the course may need adjustment, but the journey continues . . . —MICHAEL J. HERNANDEZ DATABASE DESIGN FOR MERE MORTALS®, SECOND EDTION  To say that the technology field, and database management in par- ticular, has changed significantly in the nine years since the second  edition of this book was published would be an understatement, to be  sure. Small, handheld devices containing storage capacity and pro- cessing power that once would have required several room-sized main- frame computers are now so ubiquitous that many people take them  for granted, especially the more recent generations.  My young nephew  would likely never understand the excitement I experienced when I  purchased my first 40MB storage expansion card for my IBM PC. But  that’s another story.  Database management systems can now handle  terabytes of data, and there’s recently been a considerable amount of  emphasis on storing, managing, and accessing data “in the cloud.”  Is there still a need, then, for a book such as the one you hold in your  hands? Absolutely! Regardless of how complex or complicated database  management becomes, there will always be a need for a book on the  basics of database design. You must learn the fundamentals in order  to know how and why things work the way they do. This is true of  many other areas of expertise, whether they are technical disciplines  such as architectural design and engineering or artistic disciplines  such as music and cooking.   xxv   xxvi  Preface  My journey has taken me along new and different paths in recent  years, and I’m really enjoying what I do. I’ve been doing a lot more  writing lately, which is why I thought it was time to do this new edi- tion. I thought I’d share some new nuggets of information I’ve learned  along the way and perhaps clarify my perspectives on this subject a  little more. Now that I’ve completed this work, I can’t wait to see where  my journey takes me next.

Acknowledgments  Writing is truly a cooperative effort, despite what you may have heard  about it. I’m so grateful for the editors, colleagues, friends, and family  who continue to be ready and willing to lend their help. These are the  people who provided encouragement and kept me focused on the task  at hand, and it is to them that I extend my most heartfelt appreciation.  First and foremost, I want to thank my wonderful editor, Joan Mur- ray, for the opportunity to write yet another edition of my book. We  had been talking about this project for a couple of years, and it was  her perseverance, patience, kindness, and leadership that helped me  decide to take on this work and bring it to successful completion. I also  want to thank production editor Caroline Senay for guiding the author  review process with such a deft hand and copy editor Audrey Doyle for  her precise and detailed review of the content. And a special thanks  to John Fuller and his production staff—they did great work, as they  always do! I’ve always had a wonderful relationship with the Addison- Wesley team, and I just can’t imagine why I’d ever want to write techni- cal books for anyone else.  Next, I’d like to acknowledge my distinguished technical review team:  Tracy Thornton, Tony Wiggins, and Theodor Richardson. These folks  graciously and generously gave their time, effort, and expertise to pro- vide me with a wealth of valuable feedback and suggestions. This book  definitely benefitted from their contributions. My thanks once again to  each of you for your time and input and for helping to make this edi- tion even better than I first envisioned.  xxvii   xxviii   Acknowledgments  I want to extend a very special thanks to Ken Getz for once again  providing the foreword for my book. Ken is a well-respected expert, a  colleague, and a good friend. I’m so pleased to have his thoughts and  comments at the beginning of the book.  A special thanks also goes to all of those readers who took the time to  send me their thoughts and comments. I am humbled by their praise  and support and particularly appreciative of the good, constructive  criticism that eventually helped me to improve the material in this  edition. I also wish to thank all the academic institutions, government  agencies, and commercial organizations that have adopted my book  and made it “standard reading” for those just beginning their database  careers. I am honored by their support of my work.  Finally, I want to thank my wife for her unending patience while I was  enmeshed in my writing. Her help and support have been invaluable,  and once again, I owe her a great debt. I would tell you exactly how I  feel about her, but she abhors any sort of PDA  public display of affec- tion . Instead, I’ll just extend her a laurel and hardy handshake.   Introduction  Plain cooking cannot be entrusted to plain cooks. —COUNTESS MORPHY  In the past, the process of designing a database has been a task  performed by people in information technology  IT  departments and  professional database developers. These people usually had mathemat- ical, computer science, or systems design backgrounds and typically  worked with large mainframe databases. Many of them were experi- enced programmers and had coded a number of database application  programs consisting of thousands of lines of code.  And these people  were usually very overworked due to the nature and importance of  their work!   People designing database systems at that time needed to have a solid  educational background because most of the systems they created  were meant to be used companywide. Even when creating databases  for single departments within a company or for small businesses, data- base designers still required extensive formal training because of the  complexity of the programming languages and database application  programs they were using. As technology advanced, however, those  educational requirements evolved.  Database software programs have evolved quite a bit since the 1980s,  too. Many vendors developed software that ran on desktop computers  and could be more easily programmed to collect, store, and manage  data than their mainframe counterparts. As computing power and  demand for complexity grew, vendors produced software that allowed  groups of people to access and share centralized data within a variety   xxix   xxx  Introduction  of environments, such as client server architectures on computers  connected within local area networks  LANs  and wide area networks   WANs . People within a company or organization were no longer  strictly dependent on mainframe databases or on having their infor- mation needs met by centralized IT departments.  The emergence and wide use of the laptop computer and the evolu- tion and greater acceptance of the Internet have also played a part in  database software development. Laptops have become quite powerful,  with gigabytes of memory and storage, and extremely fast processing  power. They’ve become so ubiquitous that they’ve all but replaced the  desktop computer in many environments. They’ve also allowed people  to be connected to the Internet even in such mundane places as coffee  shops, restaurants, and airports.  And I won’t even mention the pleth- ora of other devices that now allow the same type of access—that’s for  another book and another discussion.  As such, there’s been a greater  push by both software vendors and businesses to run database soft- ware and manage databases from the Internet, thus allowing people  to access their applications and data from anywhere at any time. It  will be interesting to see how this whole idea progresses over the next  several years.  Vendors continue to add new features and enhance the tool sets in  their database software, enabling database developers to create more  powerful and flexible database applications. They’re also constantly  improving the ease with which the software can be used, enabling  many people to create their own database applications. Today’s data- base software greatly simplifies the process of creating efficient data- base structures and intuitive user interfaces.  Most programs provide sample database structures that you can copy  and alter to suit your specific needs. Although you might initially  think that it would be quite advantageous for you to use these sam- ple structures as the basis for a new database, you should stop and    Introduction  xxxi  reconsider that move for a moment. Why? Because you could easily  and unwittingly create an improper, inefficient, and incomplete design.  Then you would eventually encounter problems in what you believed to  be a dependable database design. This, of course, raises the question,  “What types of problems would I encounter?”  Most problems that surface in a database fall into two categories:  application problems and data problems. Application problems include  such things as problematic data entry edit forms, confusing menus  and toolbars, confusing dialog boxes, and tedious task sequences.  These problems typically arise when the database developer is inexpe- rienced, is unfamiliar with a good application design methodology, or  knows too little about the software he’s using to implement the data- base. Problems of this nature are common and important to address,  but they are beyond the scope of this work.  ❖ Note  One good way to solve many of your application prob- lems is to purchase and study third-party “developer” books that cover the software you’re using. Such books discuss application design issues, advanced programming techniques, and various tips and tricks that you can use to improve and enhance an application. Armed with these new skills, you can revamp and fine-tune the database application so that it works correctly, smoothly, and efficiently.  Data problems, on the other hand, include such things as missing  data, incorrect data, mismatched data, and inaccurate information.  Poor database design is typically the root cause of these types of prob- lems. A database will not fulfill an organization’s information require- ments if it is not structured properly. Although poor design is typically  generated by a database developer who lacks knowledge of good data- base design principles, it shouldn’t necessarily reflect negatively on    xxxii  Introduction  the developer. Many people, including experienced programmers and  database developers, have had little or no instruction in any form of  database design methodology. Many are unaware that design method- ologies even exist. Data problems and poor design are the issues that  this work will address.

The reason you have this book in your hands is to learn how  to design a database properly. If you’re just getting into database    Who Should Read This Book   xxxiii  management and you’re thinking about developing your own data- bases, this book will be very valuable to you. It’s better that you learn  how to create a database properly from the beginning than that you  learn by trial and error. Believe me, the latter method takes much  longer.  If you fall into the category of those people who have been working  with database programs for a while and are ready to begin developing  new databases for your company or business, you should read this  book. You probably have a good feel for what a good database structure  should look like, but aren’t quite sure how database developers arrive  at an effective design. Maybe you’re a programmer who has created a  number of databases following a few basic guidelines, but you have  always ended up writing a lot of code to get the database to work prop- erly. If this is the case, this book is also for you.  It would be a good idea for you to read this book even if you already  have some background in database design. Perhaps you learned a  design methodology back in college or attended a database class that  discussed design, but your memory is vague about some details, or  there were parts of the design process that you just did not completely  understand. Those points with which you had difficulty will finally  become clear once you learn and understand the design process pre- sented in this book.  This book is also appropriate for those of you who are experienced  database developers and programmers. Although you may already  know many of the aspects of the design process presented here, you’ll  probably find that there are some elements that you’ve never before  encountered or considered. You may even come up with fresh ideas  about how to design your databases by reviewing the material in this  book because many of the design processes familiar to you are pre- sented here from a different viewpoint. At the very least, this book can  serve as a great refresher course in database design.   xxxiv   Introduction  The Purpose of This Book  In general terms, there are three phases to the overall database devel- opment process.  1. Logical design: The first phase involves determining and defin-  ing tables and their fields, establishing primary and foreign keys, establishing table relationships, and determining and establishing the various levels of data integrity.  2. Physical implementation: The second phase entails creating the  tables, establishing key fields and table relationships, and using the proper tools to implement the various levels of data integrity.  3. Application development: The third phase involves creating an  application that allows a single user or group of users to interact with the data stored in the database. The application develop- ment phase itself can be divided into separate processes, such as determining end-user tasks and their appropriate sequences, determining information requirements for report output, and creating a menu system for navigating the application.  You should always go through the logical design first and execute it as  completely as possible. After you’ve created a sound structure, you can  then implement it within any database software you choose. As you  begin the implementation phase, you may find that you need to modify  the database structure based on the pros and cons or strengths and  weaknesses of the database software you’ve chosen. You may even  decide to make structural modifications to enhance data processing  performance. Performing the logical design first ensures that you  make conscious, methodical, clear, and informed decisions concern- ing the structure of your database. As a result, you help minimize the  potential number of further structural modifications you might need to  make during the physical implementation and application development  phases.   The Purpose of This Book   xxxv  This book deals with only the logical design phase of the overall devel- opment process, and the book’s main purpose is to explain the process  of relational database design without using the advanced, orthodox  methodologies found in an overwhelming majority of database design  books. I’ve taken care to avoid the complexities of these methodologies  by presenting a relatively straightforward, commonsense approach to  the design process. I also use a simple and straightforward data mod- eling method as a supplement to this approach, and present the entire  process as clearly as possible and with a minimum of technical jargon.  There are many database design books out on the market that include  chapters on implementing the database within a specific database  product, and some books even seem to meld the design and implemen- tation phases together.  I’ve never particularly agreed with the idea  of combining these phases, and I’ve always maintained that a data- base developer should perform the logical design and implementation  phases separately to ensure maximum focus, effectiveness, and effi- ciency.  The main drawback that I’ve encountered with these types of  books is that it can be difficult for a reader to obtain any useful or rele- vant information from the implementation chapters if he or she doesn’t  work with the particular database software or programming language  that the book incorporates. It is for this reason that I decided to write a  book that focuses strictly on the logical design of the database.  This book should be easier to read than other books you may have  encountered on the subject. Many of the database design books on the  market are highly technical and can be difficult to assimilate. I think  most of these books can be confusing and overwhelming if you are not  a computer science major, database theorist, or experienced database  developer. The design principles you’ll learn within these pages are  easy to understand and remember, and the examples are common and  generic enough to be relevant to a wide variety of situations.  Most people I’ve met in my travels around the country have told me  that they just want to learn how to create a sound database structure    xxxvi   Introduction  without having to learn about normal forms or advanced mathematical  theories. Many people are not as worried about implementing a struc- ture within a specific database software program as they are about  learning how to optimize their data structures and how to impose data  integrity. In this book, you’ll learn how to create efficient database  structures, how to impose several levels of data integrity, as well as  how to relate tables together to obtain information in an almost infinite  number of ways. Don’t worry; this isn’t as difficult a task as you might  think. You’ll be able to accomplish all of this by understanding a few  key terms and by learning and using a specific set of commonsense  techniques and concepts.  You’ll also learn how to analyze and leverage an existing database,  determine information requirements, and determine and implement  business rules. These are important topics because many of you will  probably inherit old databases that you’ll need to revamp using what  you’ll learn by reading this book. They’ll also be just as important  when you create a new database from scratch.  When you finish reading this book, you’ll have the knowledge and tools  necessary to create a good relational database structure. I’m confident  that this entire approach will work for a majority of developers and the  databases they need to create.  How to Read This Book  I strongly recommend that you read this book in sequence from begin- ning to end, regardless of whether you are a novice or a professional.  You’ll keep everything in context this way and avoid the confusion  that generally comes from being unable to see the “big picture” first.  It’s also a good idea to learn the process as a whole before you begin to  focus on any one part.   How This Book Is Organized   xxxvii  If you are reading this book to refresh your design skills, you could  read just those sections that are of interest to you. As much as pos- sible, I’ve tried to write each chapter so that it can stand on its own;  nonetheless, I still recommend that you glance through each chapter  to make sure you’re not missing any new ideas or points on design that  you may not have considered up to now.  How This Book Is Organized  Here’s a brief overview of what you’ll find in each part and each  chapter.  Part I: Relational Database Design  This section provides an introduction to databases, the idea of data- base design, and some of the terminology you’ll need to be familiar  with in order to learn and understand the design process presented in  this book.  Chapter 1, “The Relational Database,” provides a brief discussion of  the types of databases you’ll encounter, common database models, and  a brief history of the relational database.  Chapter 2, “Design Objectives,” explores why you should be concerned  with design, points out the objectives and advantages of good design,  and provides a brief introduction to Normalization and normal forms.  Chapter 3, “Terminology,” covers the terms you need to know in order  to learn and understand the design methodology presented in this book.  Part II: The Design Process  Each aspect of the database design process is discussed in detail in  Part II, including establishing table structures, assigning primary    xxxviii   Introduction  keys, setting field specifications, establishing table relationships, set- ting up views, and establishing various levels of data integrity.  Chapter 4, “Conceptual Overview,” provides an overview of the design  process, showing you how the different components of the process fit  together.  Chapter 5, “Starting the Process,” covers how to define a mission  statement and mission objectives for the database, both of which pro- vide you with an initial focus for creating your database.  Chapter 6, “Analyzing the Current Database,” covers issues concern- ing the existing database. We look at reasons for analyzing the current  database, how to look at current methods of collecting and presenting  data, why and how to conduct interviews with users and management,  and how to compile initial field lists.  Chapter 7, “Establishing Table Structures,” covers topics such as  determining and defining what subjects the database should track,  associating fields with tables, and refining table structures.  Chapter 8, “Keys,” covers the concept of keys and their importance to  the design process, as well as how to define candidate and primary  keys for each table.  Chapter 9, “Field Specifications,” covers a topic that a number of data- base developers tend to minimize. Besides indicating how each field  is created, field specifications determine the very nature of the values  a field contains. Topics in this chapter include the importance of field  specifications, types of specification characteristics, and how to define  specifications for each field in the database.  Chapter 10, “Table Relationships,” explains the importance of table  relationships, types of relationships, setting up relationships, and  establishing relationship characteristics.   How This Book Is Organized   xxxix  Chapter 11, “Business Rules,” covers types of business rules, deter- mining and establishing business rules, and using validation tables.  Business rules are very important in any database because they pro- vide a distinct level of data integrity.  Chapter 12, “Views,” looks into the concept of views and why they are  important, types of views, and how to determine and set up views.  Chapter 13, “Reviewing Data Integrity,” reviews each level of integrity  that has been defined and discussed in previous chapters. Here you  learn that it’s a good idea to review the final design of the database  structure to ensure that you’ve imposed data integrity as completely as  you can.  Part III: Other Database Design Issues  This section deals with topics such as avoiding bad design and bend- ing the rules set forth in the design process.  Chapter 14, “Bad Design—What Not to Do,” covers the types of designs  you should avoid, such as a flat-file design and a spreadsheet design.  Chapter 15, “Bending or Breaking the Rules,” discusses those rare  instances in which it may be necessary to stray from the techniques  and concepts of the design process. This chapter tells you when you  should consider bending the rules, as well as how it should be done.  Part IV: Appendixes  These appendices provide information that I thought would be valuable  to you as you’re learning about the database design process and when  you’re working on developing your database.  Appendix A, “Answers to Review Questions,” contains the answers to  all of the review questions in Chapters 1 through 12.   xl  Introduction  Appendix B, “Diagram of the Database Design Process,” provides a  diagram that maps the entire database design process.  Appendix C, “Design Guidelines,” provides an easy reference to the  various sets of design guidelines that appear throughout the book.  Appendix D, “Documentation Forms,” provides blank copies of the  Field Specifications, Business Rule Specifications, and View Specifica- tions sheets, which you can copy and use on your database projects.  Appendix E, “Database Design Diagram Symbols,” contains a quick  and easy reference to the diagram symbols used throughout the book.  Appendix F, “Sample Designs,” contains sample database designs that  can serve as the basis for ideas for databases you may want or need to  create.  Appendix G, “On Normalization,” provides a discussion on how I incor- porated Normalization into my design methodology.  Appendix H, “Recommended Reading,” provides a list of books that  you should read if you are inte rested in pursuing an in-depth study of  database technology.  Glossary contains concise definitions of various words and phrases  used throughout the book.  IMPORTANT: READ THIS SECTION!  A Word About the Examples and  Techniques in This Book  You’ll notice that there are a wide variety of examples in this book.  I’ve made sure that they are as generic and relevant as possible. How- ever, you may notice that several of the examples are rather simplified,    A Word About the Examples and Techniques in This Book   xli  incomplete, or occasionally even incorrect. Believe it or not, I created  them that way on purpose.  I’ve created some examples with errors so that I could illustrate spe- cific concepts and techniques. Without these examples, you wouldn’t  see how the concepts or techniques are put to use, as well as the  results you should expect from using them. Other examples are simple  because, once again, the focus is on the technique or concept and not  on the example itself. For instance, there are many ways that you can  design an order-tracking database. However, the structure of the sam- ple order-tracking database I use in this book is simple because the  focus is specifically on the design process, not on creating an elaborate  order-tracking database system.  So what I’m really trying to emphasize here is this:  Focus on the concept or technique and its intended results, not  on the example used to illustrate it.  A New Approach to Learning  Here’s an approach to learning the design process  or pretty much any- thing else, for that matter  that I’ve found very useful in my database  design classes.  Think of all the techniques used in the design process as a set of tools;  each tool  or technique  is used for a specific purpose. The idea here  is that once you learn how a tool is used generically, you can then use  that tool in any number of situations. The reason you can do this is  because you use the tool the same way in each situation.  Take a Crescent wrench, for example. Generically speaking, you use  a Crescent wrench to fasten and unfasten a nut to a bolt. You open or  close the jaw of the wrench to fit a given bolt by using the adjusting  screw located on the head of the wrench. Now that you’re clear about its  use, try using it on a few bolts. Try it on the legs of an outdoor chair, or    xlii  Introduction  the fan belt cover on an engine, or the side panel of an outdoor cooling  unit, or the hinge plates of an iron gate. Do you notice that regard- less of where you encounter a nut and bolt, you can always fasten and  unfasten the nut by using the Crescent wrench in the same manner?  The tools used to design a database work in exactly the same way.  Once you understand how a tool is used generically, it will work the  same way regardless of the circumstances under which it is used. For  instance, consider the tool  or technique  for decomposing a field value.  Say you have a single ADDRESS field in a CUSTOMERS table that con- tains the street address, city, state, and zip code for a given customer.  You’ll find it difficult to use this field in your database because it  contains more than one item of data; you’ll certainly have a hard time  retrieving information for a particular city or sorting the information  by a specific zip code.  The solution to this apparent dilemma is to decompose the ADDRESS  field into smaller fields. You do this by identifying the distinct items  that make up the value of the field, and then treating each item as its  own separate field. That’s all there is to it! This process constitutes a  “tool” that you can now use on any field containing a value composed  of two or more distinct data items, such as these sample fields. The  following table shows the results of the decomposition process.

You’ll be able to  design a sound database structure using these techniques regardless  of the type of database you need to create. Just be sure to remember  this:  Focus on the concept or technique being presented and its  intended results, not on the example used to illustrate it.

It spawned a multibillion-dollar industry, is the most widely used type  of database in the world today, and is an essential part of our everyday  lives. It is very likely that you are using a relational database every  time you purchase goods online or at a local store, make travel plans  with your travel agent, check out books at the library, or make a pur- chase on the Internet.  Before we delve into the design process, let’s take a look at a brief his- tory of the relational database—where it came from, where it is now,  and where it’s likely to go in the future.  3   4   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  Types of Databases  What is a database? As you probably know, a database is an organized  collection of data used for the purpose of modeling some type of orga- nization or organizational process. It really doesn’t matter whether  you’re using paper or a computer application program to collect and  store the data. As long as you’re gathering data in some organized  manner for a specific purpose, you’ve got a database. Throughout the  remainder of this discussion, we’ll assume that you’re using an appli- cation program to collect and maintain your data.  There are two types of databases in database management, opera- tional databases and analytical databases.  Operational databases are the backbone of many companies, organiza- tions, and institutions throughout the world. This type of database is  primarily used in online transaction processing  OLTP  scenarios, that  is, in situations where there is a need to collect, modify, and main- tain data on a daily basis. The type of data stored in an operational  database is dynamic, meaning that it changes constantly and always  reflects up-to-the-minute information. Organizations such as retail  stores, manufacturing companies, hospitals and clinics, and publish- ing houses use operational databases because their data is in a con- stant state of flux.  In contrast, analytical databases are primarily used in online analyt- ical processing  OLAP  scenarios, where there is a need to store and  track historical and time-dependent data. An analytical database is  a valuable asset when there is a need to track trends, view statistical  data over a long period of time, and make tactical or strategic business  projections. This type of database stores static data, meaning that the  data is never  or very rarely  modified. The information gleaned from  an analytical database reflects a point-in-time snapshot of the data.  Chemical labs, geological companies, and marketing analysis firms are  examples of organizations that use analytical databases.   Early Database Models   5  Analytical databases often use data from operational databases as  their main data source, so there can be some amount of association  between them; nevertheless, operational and analytical databases  fulfill very specific types of data processing needs and creating their  structures requires radically different design methodologies. This book  focuses on designing an operational database because it is still the  most commonly used type of database in the world today.  Early Database Models  In the days before the relational database model, two data models were  commonly used to maintain and manipulate data—the hierarchical  database model and the network database model.  ❖ Note  I’ve provided a brief overview of each of these models for historical purposes only. In an overall sense, I believe it is use- ful for you to know what preceded the relational model so that you have a basic understanding of what led to its creation and evolution.  In the following overview I briefly describe how the data in each  model is structured and accessed, how the relationship between  a pair of tables is represented, and one or two of the advantages  or disadvantages of each model.  Some of the terms you’ll encounter in this section are explained in  more detail in Chapter 3, “Terminology.”  The Hierarchical Database Model  Data in this type of database is structured hierarchically and is  typically diagrammed as an inverted tree. A single table in the data- base acts as the “root” of the inverted tree and other tables act as the    6   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  branches flowing from the root. Figure 1.1 shows a diagram of a typi- cal hierarchical database structure.  Agents  Entertainers  Clients  Schedule  Engagements  Payments  Figure 1.1  Diagram of a typical hierarchical database  Agents Database In the example shown in Figure 1.1, an agent books several  entertainers, and each entertainer has his own schedule. An  agent also maintains a number of clients whose entertain- ment needs are met by the agent. A client books engagements  through the agent and makes payments to him for his services.  A relationship in a hierarchical database is represented by the term  parent child. In this type of relationship, a parent table can be associ- ated with one or more child tables, but a single child table can be asso- ciated with only one parent table. These tables are explicitly linked  via a pointer or by the physical arrangement of the records within  the tables. A user accesses data within this model by starting at the  root table and working down through the tree to the target data. This  access method requires the user to be very familiar with the structure  of the database.   Early Database Models   7  One advantage to using a hierarchical database is that a user can  retrieve data very quickly because there are explicit links between the  table structures. Another advantage is that referential integrity is built  in and automatically enforced. This ensures that a record in a child  table must be linked to an existing record in a parent table, and that  a record deleted in the parent table will cause all associated records in  the child table to be deleted as well.  ❖ Note  In the following examples, table names within the text appear in all capital letters  such as VENDORS  and field names within the text appear in small capital letters  such as VENDOR ID NUMBER .  A problem occurs in a hierarchical database when a user needs to  store a record in a child table that is currently unrelated to any record  in a parent table. Consider an example using the Agents database  shown in Figure 1.1. A user cannot enter a new entertainer in the  ENTERTAINERS table until the entertainer is assigned to an agent  in the AGENTS table. Recall that a record in a child table  in this  case, ENTERTAINERS  must be related to a record in the parent table   AGENTS . Yet in real life, entertainers commonly sign up with the  agency well before they are assigned to specific agents. This scenario  is difficult to model in a hierarchical database. The rules can be bent  without breaking them if a dummy agent record is inserted in the  AGENTS table; however, this option is not really optimal.  This type of database cannot support complex relationships, and there  is often a problem with redundant data. For example, there is a many- to-many relationship between clients and entertainers—an entertainer  will perform for many clients, and a client will hire many entertain- ers. You can’t directly model this type of relationship in a hierarchical  database, so you’ll have to introduce redundant data into both the  SCHEDULE and ENGAGEMENTS tables.   8   Chapter 1  The Relational Database   cid:129  The SCHEDULE table will now have client data  such as client  name, address, and phone number  to show for whom and where each entertainer is performing. This particular data is redundant because it is currently stored in the CLIENTS table.   cid:129  The ENGAGEMENTS table will now contain data on entertainers   such as entertainer name, phone number, and type of enter- tainer  to indicate which entertainers are performing for a given client. This data is redundant as well because it is currently stored in the ENTERTAINERS table.  The problem with this redundancy is that it opens up the possibility of  allowing a user to enter a single piece of data inconsistently. This, in  turn, can result in producing inaccurate information.  A user can solve this problem in a roundabout manner by creating  one hierarchical database specifically for entertainers and another  specifically for agents. The new Entertainers database will contain  only the ENTERTAINERS table, and the revised Agents database will  contain the AGENTS, CLIENTS, PAYMENTS, and ENGAGEMENTS  tables. The SCHEDULE table is no longer needed in the Entertainers  database because you can define a logical child relationship between  the ENGAGEMENTS table in the Agents database and the ENTER- TAINERS table in the Entertainers database. With this relationship in  place, you can retrieve a variety of information, such as a list of booked  entertainers for a given client or a performance schedule for a given  entertainer. Figure 1.2 shows a diagram of the new model.  As you can see, a person designing a hierarchical database must be  able to recognize the need to use this technique for a many-to-many  relationship. Here the need is relatively obvious, but many relation- ships are more obscure and may not be discovered until very late in  the design process or, more disturbingly, well after the database has  been put into operation.   Early Database Models   9  Entertainers Database  Entertainers  Agents Database  Agents  Clients  Logical Child  Relationship  Engagements  Payments  Figure 1.2  Using two hierarchical databases to resolve a many-to-many  relationship  The hierarchical database lent itself well to the tape storage systems  used by mainframes in the 1970s and was very popular in companies  that used those systems. But, despite the fact that the hierarchical  database provided fast and direct access to data and was useful in a  number of circumstances, it was clear that a new database model was  needed to address the growing problems of data redundancy and com- plex relationships among data.  The Network Database Model  The network database was, for the most part, developed as an attempt  to address some of the problems of the hierarchical database. The  structure of a network database is represented in terms of nodes and set  structures. Figure 1.3 shows a diagram of a typical network database.  A node represents a collection of records, and a set structure estab- lishes and represents a relationship in a network database. It is a    10   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  Agents  Represent  Manage  Clients  Entertainers  Make  Schedule  Perform  Play  Payments  Engagements  Musical Styles  Figure 1.3  Diagram of a typical network database  transparent construction that relates a pair of nodes together by using  one node as an owner and the other node as a member.  This is a valu- able improvement on the parent child relationship.  A set structure  supports a one-to-many relationship, which means that a record in the  owner node can be related to one or more records in the member node,  but a single record in the member node is related to only one record  in the owner node. Additionally, a record in the member node cannot  exist without being related to an existing record in the owner node. For  example, a client must be assigned to an agent, but an agent with no  clients can still be listed in the database. Figure 1.4 shows a diagram  of a basic set structure.  One or more sets  connections  can be defined between a specific  pair of nodes, and a single node can also be involved in other sets  with other nodes in the database. In Figure 1.3, for instance, the   CLIENTS node is related to the PAYMENTS node via the Make set  structure. It is also related to the ENGAGEMENTS node via the Sched- ule set structure. Along with being related to the CLIENTS node, the    Early Database Models   11  1  M  Agents  Owner Node  Represent  Set Structure  Clients  Member Node  Figure 1.4  A basic set structure  ENGAGEMENTS node is related to the ENTERTAINERS node via the  Perform set structure.  A user can access data within a network database by working through  the appropriate set structures. Unlike the hierarchical database, where  access must begin from a root table, a user can access data from  within the network database, starting from any node and working  backward or forward through related sets. Consider the Agents data- base in Figure 1.3 once again. Say a user wants to find the agent who  booked a specific engagement. She begins by locating the appropriate  engagement record in the ENGAGEMENTS node, and then determines  which client “owns” that engagement record via the Schedule set  structure. Finally, she identifies the agent that “owns” the client record  via the Represent set structure. The user can answer a wide variety of  questions as long as she navigates properly through the appropriate  set structures.  One advantage the network database provides is fast data access. It  also allows users to create queries that are more complex than those  they created using a hierarchical database. A network database’s main  disadvantage is that a user has to be very familiar with the structure    12   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  of the database in order to work through the set structures. Consider  the Agents database in Figure 1.3 once again. It is incumbent on the  user to be familiar with the appropriate set structures if she is to  determine whether a particular engagement has been paid. Another  disadvantage is that it is not easy to change the database structure  without affecting the application programs that interact with it. Recall  that a relationship is explicitly defined as a set structure in a network  database. You cannot change a set structure without affecting the  application programs that use this structure to navigate through the  data. If you change a set structure, you must also modify all references  made from within the application program to that structure.  Although the network database was clearly a step up from the hierar- chical database, a few people in the database community believed that  there must be a better way to manage and maintain large amounts of  data. As each data model emerged, users found that they could ask  more complex questions, thereby increasing the demands made upon  the database. And so we come to the relational database model.  The Relational Database Model  The relational database was first conceived in 1969 and is still one  of the most widely used database models in database management  today. The father of the relational model, Dr. Edgar F. Codd, was an  IBM research scientist in the late 1960s and was at that time looking  into new ways to handle large amounts of data. His dissatisfaction  with the database models and database products of the time led him  to begin thinking of ways to apply the disciplines and structures of  mathematics to solve the myriad problems he had been encountering.  Being a mathematician by profession, he strongly believed that he  could apply specific branches of mathematics to solve problems such  as data redundancy, weak data integrity, and a database structure’s  over dependence on its physical implementation.   The Relational Database Model   13  Dr. Codd formally presented his new relational model in a landmark  work entitled “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data- banks”1 in June 1970. He based his new model on two branches of  mathematics—set theory and first-order predicate logic. Indeed, the  name of the model itself is derived from the term relation, which is part  of set theory.  A widely held misconception is that the relational model  derives its name from the fact that tables within a relational database  can be related to one another.   A relational database stores data in relations, which the user perceives  as tables. Each relation is composed of tuples, or records, and attri- butes, or fields.  I’ll use the terms tables, records, and fields through- out the remainder of the book.  The physical order of the records or  fields in a table is completely immaterial, and each record in the table  is identified by a field that contains a unique value. These are the two  characteristics of a relational database that allow the data to exist  independent of the way it is physically stored in the computer. As such,  a user isn’t required to know the physical location of a record in order  to retrieve its data. This is unlike the hierarchical and network data- base models in which knowing the layout of the structures is crucial to  retrieving data.  The relational model categorizes relationships as one-to-one, one-to- many, and many-to-many.  These relationships are covered in detail  in Chapter 10, “Table Relationships.”  A relationship between a pair of  tables is established implicitly through matching values of a shared  field. In Figure 1.5, for example, the CLIENTS and AGENTS tables are  related via an Agent ID field; a specific client is associated with an  agent through a matching Agent ID. Likewise, the ENTERTAINERS  and ENGAGEMENTS tables are related via an Entertainer ID; a record  in the ENTERTAINERS table can be associated with a record in the  ENGAGEMENTS table through matching Entertainer IDs.   1.

He can access data from tables that are directly related and  from tables that are indirectly related. Consider the Agents database    The Relational Database Model   15  in Figure 1.5. Although the CLIENTS table is indirectly related to  the ENGAGEMENTS table, the user can produce a list of clients and  the entertainers who have performed for them.  Of course, it really  depends on how the tables are actually structured, but I digress. This  example serves our purpose for now.  He can do this easily because  CLIENTS is directly related to ENGAGEMENTS and ENGAGEMENTS is  directly related to ENTERTAINERS.  Retrieving Data  You retrieve data in a relational database by using Structured Query  Language  SQL . SQL is the standard language used to create, mod- ify, maintain, and query relational databases. The following shows a  sample SQL query statement you can use to produce a list of all clients  in the city of El Paso:  SELECT ClientLastName, ClientFirstName, ClientPhoneNumber FROM Clients WHERE City = "El Paso" ORDER BY ClientLastName, ClientFirstName  The three components of a basic SQL query are the SELECT…FROM  statement, the WHERE clause, and the ORDER BY clause. You use the  SELECT clause to indicate the fields you want to use in the query and  the FROM clause to indicate the table s  to which the fields belong. You  can filter the records the query returns by imposing criteria against  one or more fields with the WHERE clause, and then sort the results in  ascending or descending order with the ORDER BY clause.  Most of today’s major relational database software programs incor- porate various forms of SQL implementations, ranging from windows  in which users can manually enter “raw” SQL statements to tools  that allow users to build queries using various graphic elements. For  example, a user working with R:BASE Technologies’ R:BASE can opt  to build and execute SQL query statements directly from a command  prompt, while someone using Microsoft SQL Server may find it easier    16   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  to build queries using SQL Server’s graphical query builder. Regardless  of how the queries are built, the user can save them for future use.  It’s not always necessary for you to know SQL in order to work with a  database. If your database software provides a graphical query builder  or you’re using a custom-built application to work with the data in  your database, you’ll never need to write a single SQL statement. It’s  a good idea, however, for you to gain a basic understanding of SQL. It  will help those of you using query-building tools to understand and  troubleshoot the queries you create with these tools, and it will defi- nitely be to your advantage should you need to work with high-end  database software programs, such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.  ❖ Note  Although a detailed discussion of SQL is beyond the scope of this book, you should understand that SQL is a lan- guage directly related to the relational database model. If you have a desire or need to study SQL, you could start by reading my second book, SQL Queries for Mere Mortals®, Second Edition, and then move on to any of the other SQL books that I have listed in Appendix H, “Recommended Reading.”  Advantages of a Relational Database  The relational database provides a number of advantages over previous  models, such as the following.   cid:129  Built-in multilevel integrity: Data integrity is built into the model at the field level to ensure the accuracy of the data; at the table level to ensure that records are not duplicated and to detect missing primary key values; at the relationship level to ensure that the relationship between a pair of tables is valid; and at the business level to ensure that the data is accurate in terms of   The Relational Database Model   17  the business itself.  Integrity is discussed in detail as the design  process unfolds.    cid:129  Logical and physical data independence from database applica- tions: Neither changes a user makes to the logical design of the database, nor changes a database software vendor makes to the physical implementation of the database, will adversely affect the applications built upon it.   cid:129  Guaranteed data consistency and accuracy: Data is consis-  tent and accurate due to the various levels of integrity you can impose within the database.  This will become quite clear as you work through the design process.    cid:129  Easy data retrieval: At the user’s command, data can be retrieved  either from a particular table or from any number of related tables within the database. This enables a user to view informa- tion in an almost unlimited number of ways.  These and other advantages have proved beneficial to the business  community and to all those who need to collect and manage data.  Indeed, the relational database has become the database of choice in  many circumstances.  One commonly perceived disadvantage of the relational database  was that software programs based on it ran very slowly. This was not  a fault of the relational model itself, but of the ancillary technology  available at the time of the model’s introduction. Processing speed,  memory, and storage were simply insufficient to provide database soft- ware vendors with a platform on which to build a full implementation  of the relational database, so the initial relational database software  programs fell woefully short of their full potential. Advances in both  hardware technology and software engineering over the past 20 years  have made processing speed an insignificant issue and have allowed  vendors to make significant gains in their efforts to support the model  more fully.   18   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  You’ll learn more about the relational database model as you work  through the design process presented in this book. Some of the topics  you’ll encounter include creating tables, establishing data integrity,  working with relationships, and establishing business rules.  Relational Database Management  Systems  A relational database management system  RDBMS  is a software appli- cation program you use to create, maintain, modify, and manipulate a  relational database. Many RDBMS programs also provide the tools you  need to create end-user applications that interact with the data stored  in the database. Of course, the quality of an RDBMS is a direct func- tion of the extent to which it supports the relational database model.  Even among “true” RDBMSs, support for the relational database varies  among vendors, and there is yet to be a full implementation of the rela- tional model’s potential. Despite this, all RDBMS programs continue to  evolve and become more full-featured and powerful than ever before.  In the earliest days of the relational database, RDBMSs were writ- ten for use on mainframe computers.  Didn’t everything start on a  mainframe?  Two RDBMS programs prevalent in the early 1970s were  System R, developed by IBM at its San Jose Research Laboratory in  California, and Interactive Graphics Retrieval System  INGRES , devel- oped at the University of California at Berkeley. These two programs  contributed greatly to the general appreciation of the relational model.  As the benefits of the relational database became more widely known,  many companies decided to make a slow move from hierarchical and  network database models to the relational database model, thus cre- ating a need for more and better mainframe RDBMS programs. The  1980s saw the development of various commercial RDBMSs for main- frame computers by companies such as Oracle and IBM.   Beyond the Relational Model   19  The early to mid-1980s saw the rise of the personal computer, and  with it the development of PC-based RDBMS programs. Some of the  early entries in this category, from companies such as Ashton-Tate and  Fox Software, were nothing more than elementary file-based database  management systems. True PC-based RDBMS programs began to  emerge with products developed by companies such as Microrim and  Ansa Software. These companies helped to spread the idea and poten- tial of database management from the mainframe-dominated domain  of information systems departments to the desktop of the common end  user.  The need to share data became apparent as more and more users  worked with databases throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The concept of a centrally located database that could be made avail- able to multiple users seemed a very promising idea. This would cer- tainly make data management and database security much easier to  implement. Database vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle responded  to this need by developing client server RDBMS programs.  In a client server environment, the data resides on a computer acting  as a database server, and users interact with the data through appli- cations residing on their own computers, or database client. The data- base developer uses the client server RDBMS program to create and  maintain the database and attendant end-user application programs.  She implements data integrity and data security on the database  server, giving her the ability to base a variety of user applications on  the same set of data without affecting the data’s integrity or security.   Beyond the Relational Model  Although RDBMSs have been widely accepted for use in typical busi- ness applications such as inventory control, patient management,  banking, order processing, and event scheduling, they proved to be    20   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  somewhat lacking for such applications as computer-aided design   CAD , geographic information systems  GIS , and multimedia storage  systems. Two new database models eventually emerged in response  to this problem: the object-oriented database and the object-relational  database.  The object-oriented model incorporates all of the characteristics of an  object-oriented programming language and essentially relegates the  relational database to the status of a data store. The fundamental  idea here is that the database developer handles every aspect of the  database, including the sets of operations that manipulate the data in  the database from within the object-oriented database programming  software. No longer is there a clear separation between the database  software and the application programming software.  As with any  other model, there are pros and cons to this approach.  Versant Corpo- ration and IBM are two vendors that produce object-oriented database  software.  Unlike the relational model, which has a solid theoretical basis in two  distinct branches of mathematics, the object-oriented database model  has no specific theoretical foundation. As such, there is no singular,  cohesive consensus as to its definition. There is, however, a version  of the model defined by the Object Management Group  OMG  that is  somewhat of a de facto standard for object-oriented database manage- ment systems.  ❖ Note  The OMG is a nonprofit international group that addresses the issues of object standards. It was founded in 1989 and comprises more than 800 member organizations. It is important to note that the OMG is not a standards body, such as the American National Standards Institute  ANSI , but merely an advisory and certification group.   What the Future Holds   21  The object-relational model  formerly known as the extended relational  data model , on the other hand, extended the relational database model  by incorporating various object-oriented elements and characteristics,  such as classes, encapsulation, and inheritance. The idea was that  these extensions would allow a relational database to manage and  manipulate more complex types of data, such as audio streams, video  clips, and architectural drawings. Vendors that have produced appli- cation programs based on this model include companies such as IBM,  Oracle, Microsoft, and the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.  What the Future Holds  The manner in which databases are used has evolved immensely in  the past several years. There came a time when many organizations  began to realize that there was a lot of useful information that could  be gathered from data they stored in various relational and nonrela- tional databases. This prompted them to question whether there was a  way to mine the data for useful analytical information that they could  then use to make critical business decisions. Furthermore, they won- dered if they could consolidate and integrate their data into a viable  knowledgebase for their organizations. Indeed, these would be difficult  questions to answer.  IBM proposed the idea of a data warehouse, which, as originally  conceived, would allow organizations to access data stored in any  number of nonrelational databases. They were unsuccessful in their  first attempts at implementing data warehouses, primarily because  of the complexities and performance problems associated with such a  task. It has been only since the 1990s that the implementation of data  warehouses has become more viable and practical. Bill Inmon, widely  regarded as the father of the data warehouse, is a strong and vocal  advocate of the technology and has been instrumental in its evolution.  Data warehouses are now more commonplace as companies move to    22   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  leverage the vast amounts of data they’ve stored in their databases  over the years.  The Internet has had a significant impact on the way organizations use  databases. Many companies and businesses use the Web to expand  their consumer base, and much of the data they share with and gather  from these consumers is stored in a database. Developers commonly  use eXtensible Markup Language  XML  to assemble and consolidate  data from various relational and nonrelational systems. There has  been a considerable effort by various vendors to get their clients to  create databases and store data in the “cloud,” that is, a location that  is completely apart from the client’s location. The idea is that the client  can access data from the “cloud” database via the Internet from any- where at any time. Given the broad emergence and use of connected  devices within the past few years  as of this writing , it will be interest- ing to see how database management systems evolve within this type  of environment.   A Final Note  RDBMSs now have a long history, and they continue to play a huge  role in the way people, businesses, and organizations interact with  their data. Their role is constantly expanding and evolving as data  becomes more accessible via the Internet and businesses move at an  ever-increasing pace to expand their presence on the Web. Numerous  organizations are heavily invested in their relational database systems,  and they are not likely to disappear anytime soon.  Summary  We opened this chapter by defining the two types of databases cur- rently used in database management: operational databases and ana- lytical databases.   Summary  23  We then briefly discussed the hierarchical database model and the  network database model. Our discussion covered the data structures,  relationships, and data access methods used in both models, as well as  their chief disadvantages. You learned that these models were widely  used in the early days of database management and led to the eventual  development and introduction of the relational database model.  Next, we provided a detailed discussion of the relational database  model, its history, and its features. We noted that it is based on specific  branches of mathematics and that this mathematical foundation is what  makes the model so structurally sound. Then we explored the model’s  data structures and relationships, and the role SQL plays in accessing  data within the model. You’ll remember, no doubt, that SQL is the stan- dard language used to work with relational databases. We ended this  section by reviewing the advantages of the relational database model.  We then took a look at a brief history of relational database manage- ment systems, beginning with the mainframe systems of the early  1970s and progressing through the PC-based systems of the 1980s to  the client server systems of the 1990s. At this point you should have a  sense of the progression of circumstances that have led to the develop- ment of the database systems we use today.  The chapter continued with a brief discussion of the object-relational  and object-oriented database models. Here you learned that these  models emerged ostensibly as a means to deal with advanced database  applications, and that they each incorporate various object-oriented  elements and characteristics.   Finally, we closed the chapter with a brief discussion of data ware- houses and accessing data via the Internet. You learned that data  warehouses are used to consolidate and integrate data from hetero- geneous sources and that the possibility of truly using them has  only recently become more viable and practical. Next, you learned  that XML is a common tool for assembling data across relational and    24   Chapter 1  The Relational Database  nonrelational data sources and that there is an ever-growing move- ment to store and manage data “in the cloud.” You should now under- stand that relational databases are likely to be used for quite some  time, despite the great impact the Internet has had on the way organi- zations use databases.  In the next chapter, we’ll discuss why you should be concerned with  database design and why theory is important. We’ll also cover the  objectives and advantages of good design.  Review Questions  1.

The Advantage of Learning a Good Design Methodology  The Importance of Theory  Objectives of Good Design  Benefits of Good Design  Database Design Methods  Normalization  Summary  Review Questions  Why Should You Be Concerned with  Database Design?  Some of you who work with relational database management sys- tem  RDBMS  application programs may wonder why you should be  concerned with database design. After all, most programs come with  sample databases that you can copy and modify to suit your own   25   26   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  needs, and you can even borrow tables from the sample databases and  use them in other databases that you’ve created. Some programs also  provide tools that will guide you through the process of defining and  creating tables. However, these tools don’t actually help you design a  database—they merely help you create the physical tables that you will  include in the database.  What you must understand is that it’s better for you to use these tools  after you’ve created the logical database structure. RDBMS programs  provide the design tools and the sample databases to help minimize  the time it takes you to implement the database structure physically.  Theoretically, reducing implementation time gives you more time to  focus on creating and building end-user applications.  Yet the primary reason you should be concerned with database design  is that it is crucial to the consistency, integrity, and accuracy of the  data in a database. If you design a database improperly, it will be diffi- cult for you to retrieve certain types of information, and you’ll run the  risk that your searches will produce inaccurate information. Inaccurate  information is probably the most detrimental result of improper database  design—it can adversely affect your organization’s bottom line. In fact, if  your database affects the manner in which your business performs its  daily operations or if it’s going to influence the future direction of your  business, you must be concerned with database design.  Let’s look at this from a different perspective for a moment: Think  about how you would go about having a custom home built. What’s the  first thing you’re going to do? Certainly you’re not going to hire a con- tractor immediately and let him build your home however he wishes.  Surely you will first engage an architect to design your new home and  then hire a contractor to build it. The architect will explore your needs  and express them as a set of blueprints, recording decisions about  size and shape and requirements for various systems  structural,  mechanical, electrical . Next, the contractor will procure the labor    The Importance of Theory   27  and materials, including the listed systems, and then assemble them  according to the drawings and specifications.  Now let’s return to our database perspective and think of the logi- cal database design as the architectural blueprints and the physical  database implementation as the completed home. The logical data- base design describes the size, shape, and necessary systems for your  database and it addresses the informational and operational needs of  your business. You then build the physical implementation of the logi- cal database design using your RDBMS program. Once you’ve created  your tables, set up table relationships, and established the appropriate  levels of data integrity, your database is complete. Now you’re ready to  design and create applications that allow you and your users to inter- act easily with the data stored in the database, and you can be con- fident that these applications will provide you with timely and, above  all, accurate information.  Although you can implement a poor design in an RDBMS, implement- ing a good design is far more to your advantage because it will yield  accurate information, store data more efficiently and effectively, and be  easier for you to manage and maintain.  The Importance of Theory  ❖ Note  In this chapter, I use the term theory to represent “gen- eral propositions used as principles” and not “conjectures or proposals.”  A number of major disciplines  and their associated design methodolo- gies  have some type of theoretical basis. Structural engineers design  an unlimited variety of structures using the theories of physics. Com- posers create beautiful symphonies and orchestral pieces using the    28   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  concepts found in music theory. The automobile industry uses aerody- namics theories to design more fuel-efficient vehicles. The aerospace  industry uses the same theories to design airplane wings that reduce  wind drag.  These examples demonstrate that theory is relevant and very import- ant. The chief advantage of theory is that it helps you predict out- comes; it allows you to predict what will happen if you perform a  certain action or series of actions. You know if you drop a stone, it will  fall to the ground. If you are agile, you can get your toes out of the way  of Newton’s theory of gravity. The point is that it works every time. If  you chisel a stone flat and place it on another flat stone, you can pre- dict that it will stay where you put it. This theory allows you to design  pyramids and cathedrals and brick outhouses. Now consider a data- base example. Let’s assume you have a pair of tables that are related to  each other. You know that you can draw data from both tables simul- taneously simply because of the way relational database theory works.  The data you draw from both tables is based on matching values of a  shared field between the tables themselves. Again, your actions have a  predictable result.  The relational database is based on two branches of mathematics  known as set theory and first-order predicate logic. This very fact is  what allows the relational database to guarantee accurate information.  These branches of mathematics also provide the basis for formulating  good design methodologies and the building blocks necessary to create  good relational database structures.  You might harbor an understandable reluctance to study complicated  mathematical concepts simply to carry out what seems to be a rather  limited task. You’re still sure to hear claims that the mathematical  theories on which the relational database and its associated design  methodologies are based don’t have any relevance to the real world, or  that they are somehow impractical. This is not true: Math is central    The Advantage of Learning a Good Design Methodology   29  to the relational model and is what guarantees the model’s viability.  But cheer up—it isn’t really necessary for you to know anything about  set theory or first-order predicate logic in order to use a relational  database! You certainly don’t have to know all the details of aerody- namics just to drive an automobile. Aerodynamics theories may help  you understand and appreciate how an automobile can get better gas  mileage, but they won’t help you learn how to parallel park.  Mathematical theory provides the foundation for the relational data- base model, and thus makes the model predictable, reliable, and  sound. Theory describes the basic building blocks used to create  a relational database and provides guidelines for how it should be  arranged. Arranging building blocks to achieve a desired result is  defined as “design.”  The Advantage of Learning a Good  Design Methodology  You could learn how to design a database properly by trial and error,  but it would take you a very long time and you would probably have to  repair many mistakes along the way. The best approach is to learn a  good database design methodology, such as the one in this book, and  then embark on designing your database.  You’ll gain several advantages from learning and using a good design  methodology.   cid:129  It gives you the skills you need to design a sound database  structure. A large number of data processing problems can be attributed to the presence of redundant data, duplicate data, and invalid data, or the absence of required data. All of these prob- lems produce erroneous information and make certain queries and reports difficult to run. You can avoid almost all of these problems by employing a good design methodology.   30   Chapter 2  Design Objectives   cid:129  It provides you with an organized set of techniques that will guide you step-by-step through the design process. The organization of the techniques enables you to make informed decisions on every aspect of your design.   cid:129  It helps you keep your missteps and design reiterations to a min- imum. Of course, you will naturally make some mistakes when you’re designing a database, but a good methodology helps you recognize errors in your design and gives you the tools to correct them. Additionally, the organization of the techniques within the methodology keeps you from unnecessarily repeating a given design process.   cid:129  It makes the design process easier and reduces the amount of time you spend designing the database. You will inevitably waste valu- able time taking an arbitrary trial-and-error approach to design because it lacks the logic and organization that a good methodol- ogy provides.   cid:129  It will help you understand and use your RDBMS application  program more fully and effectively. As your knowledge of proper design expands and grows, you’ll actually begin to understand why a given RDBMS provides certain tools and how you can use them to implement the structure within the RDBMS program.  Regardless of whether you use the design methodology presented in  this book or some other established methodology, you should choose a  design methodology, learn it as well as you can, and use it faithfully to  design your databases.  Objectives of Good Design  There are distinct objectives you must achieve in order to design a  good, sound database structure. You can avoid many of the problems    Benefits of Good Design   31  mentioned in the previous section if you keep these objectives in mind  and constantly focus on them while you’re designing your database.   cid:129  The database supports both required and ad hoc information  retrieval. The database must store the data necessary to support information requirements defined during the design process and any possible ad hoc queries that may be posed by a user.   cid:129  The tables are constructed properly and efficiently. Each table in  the database represents a single subject, is composed of relatively distinct fields, keeps redundant data to an absolute minimum, and is identified throughout the database by a field with unique values.   cid:129  Data integrity is imposed at the field, table, and relationship levels.  These levels of integrity help guarantee that the data structures and their values will be valid and accurate at all times.   cid:129  The database supports business rules relevant to the organization.  The data must provide valid and accurate information that is always meaningful to the business.   cid:129  The database lends itself to future growth. The database structure  should be easy to modify or expand as the information require- ments of the business change and grow.  You might find it difficult at times to fulfill these objectives, but you’ll  certainly be pleased with your final database structure once you’ve  met them.  Benefits of Good Design  The time you invest in designing a sound database structure is time  well spent. Good design saves you time in the long run because you  do not constantly have to revamp a quickly and poorly designed    32   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  structure. You gain the following benefits when you apply good design  techniques.   cid:129  The database structure is easy to modify and maintain. Modifica-  tions you make to a field or table will not adversely affect other fields or tables in the database.   cid:129  The data is easy to modify. Changes you make to the value of a given field in a table will not adversely affect the values of other fields within the table. Furthermore, a well-designed database keeps duplicate fields to an absolute minimum, so you typically modify a particular data value in one field only.   cid:129  Information is easy to retrieve. You’ll be able to create queries eas- ily because the tables are well constructed and the relationships between them are properly established.   cid:129  End-user applications are easy to develop and build. You can spend more time on programming and addressing the data manipulation tasks at hand, instead of working around the inev- itable problems that arise when you work with a poorly designed database.  Database Design Methods Traditional Design Methods  In general, traditional methods of database design incorporate three  phases: requirements analysis, data modeling, and Normalization.  The requirements analysis phase involves an examination of the busi- ness being modeled, interviews with users and management to assess  the current system and to analyze future needs, and an assessment of  information requirements for the business as a whole. This process is  relatively straightforward, and, indeed, the design process presented in  this book follows the same line of thinking.   Database Design Methods   33  The data modeling phase involves modeling the database structure  using a data modeling method, such as entity-relationship  ER  dia- gramming, semantic-object modeling, object-role modeling, or UML  modeling. Each of these modeling methods provides a means of visu- ally representing various aspects of the database structure, such as  the tables, table relationships, and relationship characteristics. In fact,  the modeling method used in this book is a basic version of ER dia- gramming. Figure 2.1 shows an example of a basic ER diagram.  Agents  1:N  Clients  Figure 2.1  An example of a basic ER diagram  ❖ Note  I’ve incorporated the data modeling method I use in this book into the design process itself rather than treating it sep- arately. I’ll introduce and explain each modeling technique as appropriate throughout the process.  Each data modeling method incorporates a set of diagramming sym- bols used to represent a database’s structure and characteristics. For  example, the diagram in Figure 2.1 provides information on several  aspects of the database.   cid:129  The rectangles represent two tables called AGENTS and  CLIENTS.   cid:129  The diamond represents a relationship between these two tables,  and the “1:N” within the diamond indicates that it is a one-to- many relationship.   cid:129  The vertical line next to the AGENTS table indicates that a client  must be associated with an agent, and the circle next to the   34   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  CLIENTS table indicates that an agent doesn’t necessarily have  to be associated with a client.  Fields are also defined and associated with the appropriate tables  during the data modeling phase. Each table is assigned a primary key,  various levels of data integrity are identified and implemented, and  relationships are established via foreign keys. Once the initial table  structures are complete and the relationships have been established  according to the data model, the database is ready to go through the  Normalization phase.  Normalization is the process of decomposing large tables into smaller  ones in order to eliminate redundant data and duplicate data, and  to avoid problems with inserting, updating, or deleting data. During  the Normalization process, table structures are tested against nor- mal forms and then modified if any of the aforementioned problems  are found. A normal form is a specific set of rules that can be used to  test a table structure to ensure that it is sound and free of problems.  There are a number of normal forms, and each one is used to test for  a particular set of problems. The normal forms currently in use are  First Normal Form, Second Normal Form, Third Normal Form, Fourth  Normal Form, Fifth Normal Form, Sixth Normal Form, Boyce-Codd  Normal Form, and Domain Key Normal Form.  The Design Method Presented in This Book  The design method that I use in this book is one that I’ve developed  over the years. It incorporates a requirements analysis and a simple  ER diagramming method to diagram the database structure. However,  it does not incorporate the traditional Normalization process or involve  the use of normal forms. The reason is simple: Normal forms can be  confusing to anyone who has not taken the time to study formal rela- tional database theory. For example, examine the following definition  of Third Normal Form:   Normalization  35  A relvar is in 3NF if and only if it is in 2NF and every non-key attri- bute is nontransitively dependent on the primary key.1  This description is relatively meaningless to a reader who is unfamiliar  with the terms relvar, 3NF, 2NF, non-key attribute, transitively depen- dent, and primary key.  The process of designing a database is not and should not be hard to  understand. As long as the process is presented in a straightforward  manner and each concept or technique is clearly explained, anyone  should be able to design a database properly. For example, the follow- ing definition is derived from the results of using Third Normal Form  against a table structure, and I believe most people will find it clear  and easy to understand:  A table should have a field that uniquely identifies each of its records,  and each field in the table should describe the subject that the table  represents.  The process I used to formulate this definition is the same one I used  to develop my entire design methodology.  Normalization  Back in the late 1980s, it occurred to me that the relational model  had been in existence for almost 20 years and that people had been  designing databases using the same basic methodology for about  twelve years.  And I’m still surprised we’re using it some 20+ years  later.  I was using the traditional design methodology at that time, but  I occasionally found it difficult to employ. The two things that bothered  me the most abou t it were the Normalization process  as a whole  and  the seemingly endless iterations it took to arrive at a proper design. Of  course, these seemed to be sore points with most of the other database   1. C. J. Date, An Introduction to Database Systems, 7th ed.  Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2000 , 362; emphasis added.   36   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  developers that I knew, so I certainly wasn’t alone in my frustrations. I  thought about these problems for quite some time, and then I came up  with a solution.  I already knew that the purpose of Normalization is to take an improp- erly or poorly designed table and transform it into a table with a sound  structure. I also understood the process: Take a given table and test it  against the normal forms to determine whether it is properly designed.  If it isn’t designed properly, make the appropriate modifications, retest  it, and repeat the entire process until the table structure is sound. Fig- ure 2.2 shows how I visualized the process at this point.  Non-normalized Tables  Normalization Process  Figure 2.2  How I viewed the general Normalization process  Normalized Tables  I kept these facts in mind and then posed the following questions.  1.  If we assume that a thoroughly normalized table is properly and efficiently designed, couldn’t we identify the specific character- istics of such a table and state these to be the attributes of an ideal table structure?  2. Couldn’t we then use that ideal table as a model for all tables we  create for the database throughout the design process?   Normalization  37  The answer to both questions, of course, is yes, so I began in earnest  to develop the basis for my “new” design methodology. I first compiled  distinct sets of guidelines for creating sound structures by identifying  the final characteristics of a well-defined database that successfully  passed the tests of each normal form. I then conducted a few tests,  using the new guidelines to create table structures for a new database  and to correct flaws in the table structures of an existing database.  These tests went very well, so I decided to apply this technique to  the entire traditional design methodology. I formulated guidelines to  address other issues associated with the traditional design method,  such as domains, subtypes, relationships, data integrity, and referen- tial integrity. After I completed the new guidelines, I performed more  tests and found that my methodology worked quite well.  The main advantage of my design methodology is that it removes many  aspects of the traditional design methodology that new database devel- opers find intimidating. For example, Normalization, in the traditional  sense, is now transparent to the developer because it is incorporated   via the new guidelines  throughout the design process. Another major  advantage is that the methodology is clear and easy to implement. I  believe much of this is due to the fact that I’ve written all the guidelines  in plain English, making them easy for most anyone to understand.  It’s important for you to understand that this design methodology will  yield a fully normalized database structure only if you follow it as faith- fully as you would any other design methodology. You cannot shortcut,  circumvent, de-emphasize, or omit any part of this methodology  or  any design methodology, for that matter  and expect to develop a sound  structure. You must go through the process diligently, methodically,  and completely in order to reap the expected rewards.  ❖ Note  I’ve provided a more detailed explanation of how I incor- porated Normalization into my design methodology in Appendix G, “On Normalization.”   38   Chapter 2  Design Objectives  There are a few basic terms you’ll have to learn before you delve into  the design process, and we’ll cover them in the next chapter.  Summary  At the beginning of this chapter we looked at the importance of being  concerned with database design. You now understand that database  design is crucial to the integrity and consistency of the data contained  in a database. We have seen that the chief problem resulting from  improper or poor design is inaccurate information. Proper design is of  paramount concern because bad design can adversely affect the infor- mation used by an organization.  Next, we entered into a discussion of the importance of theory, as well  as its relevance to the relational database model. You learned that the  model’s foundation in mathematical theory makes it a very sound and  reliable structure.  Following this discussion, we looked at the advantages gained by  learning a design methodology. Among other things, using a good  methodology yields an efficient and reliable database structure,  reduces the time it takes to design a database, and allows you to avoid  the typical problems caused by poor design.  Next, we listed the objectives of good design. Meeting these objectives  is crucial to the success of the database design process because they  help you ensure that the database structure is sound. We then enu- merated the advantages of good design, and you learned that the time  you invest in designing a sound database structure is time well spent.  We closed this chapter with a short discussion of traditional database  design methods, an explanation of the premise behind the design  method presented in this book, and Normalization. By now, you under- stand that traditional design methods are complex and can take some    Review Questions  39  time to learn and comprehend. On the other hand, the design method  used in this book is presented in a clear and straightforward manner,  is easy to implement, and will yield the same results as the traditional  design methodology.

Indeed, there are  other terms that you’ll need to learn, and I’ll cover them as you work  through the process. There’s also a glossary in the back of the book  that you can use to refresh your memory on any term you learn here  or in the following chapters.  Why This Terminology Is Important  Relational database design has its own unique set of terms, just as any  other profession, trade, or discipline. Here are three good reasons why  it’s important for you to learn these terms.  41   42  Chapter 3  Terminology  1. They are used to express and define the special ideas and con-  cepts of the relational database model. Much of the terminology is derived from the mathematical branches of set theory and first-order predicate logic, which form the basis of the relational database model.  2. They are used to express and define the database design process  itself. The design process becomes clearer and much easier to understand once you know these terms.    3,  They are used anywhere a relational database or RDBMS is   discussed. You’ll see these terms in publications such as trade  magazines, software manuals, educational course materials,  commercial database software books, and database-related  web sites.   This chapter covers a majority of the terms that define the ideas and  concepts of the design process, including definitions and somewhat  detailed discussions for each term.  I provide pertinent details or nec- essary further discussion for a given term at the point where the term  is expressly used within a specific technique in the design process.   There are several other terms that I introduce and discuss later in the  book because I think you’ll more easily understand them within the  context of the specific idea or concept to which they relate.  ❖ Note  The glossary contains concise definitions for all of the terms in this chapter and throughout the book.  There are four categories of terms defined in this chapter: value-  related, structure-related, relationship-related, and integrity-related.   Value-Related Terms  43  Value-Related Terms Data  The values you store in the database are data. Data is static in the  sense that it remains in the same state until you modify it by some  manual or automated process. Figure 3.1 shows some sample data.  George Edleman   92883   05 16 96   95.00  Figure 3.1  An example of basic data  This data is meaningless at this point. For example, there is no easy  way for you to determine what “92883” represents. Is  it a zip code? Is it  a part number? Even if you know it represents a customer identifica- tion number, is it one that is associated with George Edleman? There’s  just no way of knowing until you process the data.  Information  Information is data that you process in a manner that makes it mean- ingful and useful to you when you work with it or view it. It is dynamic  in the sense that it constantly changes relative to the data stored in  the database, and also in the sense that you can process it and pres- ent it in an unlimited number of ways. You can show information as  the result of a SQL SELECT statement, display it in a form on your  computer screen, or print it as a report. The point to remember is that  you must process your data in some manner so that you can turn it into  meaningful information.  Figure 3.2 demonstrates how you might process and transform the  data from the previous example into meaningful information. It has  been manipulated in such a way—in this case as part of a patient  invoice report— that it is now meaningful to anyone who views it.  It is very important that you understand the difference between  data and information. You design a database to provide meaningful    44  Chapter 3  Terminology  Eastside Medical Clinic  7743 Kingman Dr. Seattle, WA 98032  206  555-9982  Patient Name: Patient ID:  Visit Date: Physician:  George Edelman 10884  02 16 12 Daniel Chavez  Doctors Services  Service Code  Fee  Nursing Services  Service Code  Fee  X X  Consultation EKG Physical Ultrasound  92883 92773 98377 97399  119.00 95.00  R.N.

This infor- mation is available only if the appropriate data exists in the database  and the database is structured in such a way as to support that infor- mation. If you ever forget the difference between data and information,  just remember this little axiom:  Data is what you store; information is what you retrieve.  When you fully understand this single, simple concept, the logic  behind the database design process will become crystal clear.  ❖ Note  Unfortunately, data and information are two terms that are still frequently used interchangeably  and, therefore, errone- ously  throughout the database industry. You’ll encounter this error in numerous trade magazines, commercial database books, and web sites, and you’ll even see the terms misused by authors who should know better.   Value-Related Terms  45  Null  A null represents a missing or unknown value. You must understand  from the outset that a null does not represent a zero or a text string of  one or more blank spaces. The reasons are quite simple.   cid:129  A zero can have a very wide variety of meanings. It can represent the state of an account balance, the current number of available first-class ticket upgrades, or the current stock level of a particu- lar product.   cid:129  Although a text string of one or more blank spaces is guaran-  teed to be meaningless to most of us, it is definitely meaningful to a query language like SQL. A blank space is a valid character as far as SQL is concerned, and a character string composed of three blank spaces  '   '  is just as legitimate as a character string composed of three letters  'abc' . In Figure 3.3, a blank represents the fact that Washington, D.C., is not located in any county whatsoever.   cid:129  A zero-length string—two consecutive single quotes with no space in between  '' —is also an acceptable value to languages such as SQL, and can be meaningful under certain circumstances. In an EMPLOYEES table, for example, a zero-length string value in a  Clients  9001  9002  9003  9004  9005  9006  Stewart  Susan  Estela  Timothy  Marvin  Kira  Client ID  Client First Name  Client Last Name  Client City  Client County  State   >  Jameson  Black  Rosales  Ennis  Russo  Bently  King  Alameda  King  Seattle  Poulsbo  Fremont  Bellevue  Washington  Portland  WA  WA  CA  WA  DC  OR  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  Figure 3.3  An example of a table containing null values   46  Chapter 3  Terminology  field called MIDDLE INITIAL may represent the fact that a particular  employee does not have a middle initial in his name.  ❖ Note  Due to space restrictions, I cannot always show all of the fields for a given sample table. I will, however, show the fields that are most relevant to the discussion at hand and use <<other fields>> to represent fields that are unessential to the example. You’ll see this convention in many examples throughout the remainder of the book.  The Value of Nulls  A null is quite useful when you use it for its stated purpose, and the  CLIENTS table in Figure 3.3 clearly illustrates this. Each null in the  CLIENT COUNTY field represents a missing or unknown county name for  the record in which it appears. In order for you to use nulls correctly,  you must first understand why they occur at all.  Missing values are commonly the result of human error. For example,  consider the record for Shannon Black. If you’re entering the data for  Ms. Black and you fail to ask her for the name of the county she lives  in, that data is considered missing and is represented in the record  as a null. Once you recognize the error, however, you can correct it by  calling Ms. Black and asking her for the county name.  Unknown values appear in a table for a variety of reasons. One reason  may be that a specific value you need for a field is as yet undefined.  For instance, you could have a CATEGORIES table in a School Sched- uling database that doesn’t currently contain a category for a new set  of classes that you want to offer beginning in the fall session. Another  reason a table might contain unknown values is that they are truly  unknown. Refer to the CLIENTS table in Figure 3.3 once again and  consider the record for Marvin Russo. Say that you’re entering the data    Value-Related Terms  47  for Mr. Russo and you ask him for the name of the county he lives in.  If he doesn’t know the county name and you don’t happen to know the  county that includes the city in which he lives, then the value for the  county field in his record is truly unknown and is represented within  the record as a null. Obviously, you can correct the problem once  either of you determines the correct county name.  A field value may also be null if none of its values applies to a particular  record. Assume for a moment that you’re working with an EMPLOYEES  table that contains a SALARY field and an HOURLY RATE field. The value  for one of these two columns is always going to be null because an  employee cannot be paid both a fixed salary and an hourly rate.  It’s important to note that there is a very slim difference between “does  not apply” and “is not applicable.” In the previous example, the value of  one of the two fields literally does not apply. Now assume you’re work- ing with a PATIENTS table that contains a field called HAIR COLOR and  you’re currently updating a record for an existing male patient. If that  patient recently became bald, then the value for that field is definitely  “not applicable.” Although you could just use a null to represent a  value that is not applicable, I always recommend that you use a true  value such as “N A” or “Not Applicable.” This will make the information  clearer in the long run.  As you can see, whether you allow nulls in a table depends on the  manner in which you’re using the data. Now that you’ve seen the pos- itive side of using nulls, let’s take a look at the negative implication of  using them.  The Problem with Nulls  The major disadvantage of nulls is that they have an adverse effect on  mathematical operations. An operation involving a null evaluates to  null. This is logically reasonable—if a number is unknown then the    48  Chapter 3  Terminology  result of the operation is necessarily unknown. Note how a null alters  the outcome of the operation in the following example:   25 × 3  + 4 = 79   Null × 3  + 4 = Null   25 × Null  + 4 = Null   25 × 3  + Null = Null  The PRODUCTS table in Figure 3.4 helps to illustrate the effects  nulls have on mathematical expressions that incorporate fields from  a table. In this case, the value for the TOTAL VALUE field is derived from  the mathematical expression “[SRP] × [QTY ON HAND].” As you inspect  the records in this table, note that the value for the TOTAL VALUE field is  missing where the QTY ON HAND value is null, resulting in a null value  for the TOTAL VALUE field as well. This leads to a serious undetected  error that occurs when all the values in the TOTAL VALUE field are added  together: an inaccurate total. This error is “undetected” because an  RDBMS program will not inherently alert you of the error. The only  way to avoid this problem is to ensure that the values for the QTY ON  HAND field cannot be null.  Products  Product ID  Product Description  Category  SRP  Qty On Hand  Total Value  70001  70002  70003  70004  70005  70006  Shur-Lok U-Lock  Accessories  SpeedRite Cyclecomputer  SteelHead Microshell Helmet  SureStop 133-MB Brakes  Accessories  Components  Diablo ATM Mountain Bike  Bikes  UltraVision Helmet Mount Mirrors  75.00  65.00  36.00  23.50  1,200.00  7.45  20  33  16  10  1,300.00  1,118.00  376.00  74.50  Figure 3.4  The nulls in this table will have an effect on mathematical operations  involving the table’s fields.   Structure-Related Terms  49  Figure 3.5 helps to illustrate the effect nulls have on aggregate func- tions that incorporate the values of a given field in a table. The result  of an aggregate function, such as COUNT   , will be null if it  is based on a field that contains null values. The table in Figure 3.5  shows the results of a summary query that counts the total number  of occurrences of each category in the PRODUCTS table in Figure 3.4.  The value of the TOTAL OCCURRENCES field is the result of the function  expression COUNT [CATEGORY] . Notice that the summary query shows  “0” occurrences of an unspecified category, implying that each product  has been assigned a category. This information is clearly inaccurate  because there are two products in the PRODUCTS table that have not  been assigned a category.  Category Summary  Category  Total Occurrences  Accessories  Bikes  Components  0  2  1  1  Figure 3.5  Nulls affect the results of an aggregate function.  The issues of missing values, unknown values, and whether a value  will be used in a mathematical expression or aggregate function are all  taken into consideration in the database design process, and we will  revisit and discuss these issues further in later chapters.  Structure-Related Terms Table  According to the relational model, data in a relational database is  stored in relations, which are perceived by the user as tables. Each  relation is composed of tuples  records  and attributes  fields . Fig- ure 3.6 shows a typical table structure.   50  Chapter 3  Terminology  Client ID  Client First Name  Client Last Name  Client City   >  Clients  9001  9002  9003  9004  9005  9006  Stewart  Susan  Estela  Timothy  Marvin  Kira  Seattle  Poulsbo  Tacoma  Seattle  Bellingham  Tacoma  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  Records  Jameson  Black  Rosales  Ennis  Russo  Bently  Fields  Figure 3.6  A typical table structure  Tables are the chief structures in the database and each table always  represents a single, specific subject. The logical order of records and  fields within a table is of absolutely no importance, and every table  contains at least one field—known as a primary key—that uniquely  identifies each of its records.  In Figure 3.6, for example, CLIENT ID is  the primary key of the CLIENTS table.  In fact, data in a relational  database can exist independently of the way it is physically stored in  the computer because of these last two table characteristics. This is  great news for the user because he or she isn’t required to know the  physical location of a record in order to retrieve its data.  The subject that a given table represents can either be an object or an  event. When the subject is an object, it means that the table represents  something that is tangible, such as a person, place, or thing. Regard- less of its type, every object has characteristics that you can store as  data and then process as information in an almost infinite number of  ways. Pilots, products, machines, students, buildings, and equipment  are all examples of objects that a table can represent, and Figure 3.6  illustrates one of the most common examples of this type of table.   Structure-Related Terms  51  When the subject of a table is an event, it means that the table rep- resents something that occurs at a given point in time having charac- teristics you wish to record. You can store these characteristics as data  and then process the data as information in exactly the same manner  as a table that represents some specific object. Examples of events you  may need to record include judicial hearings, distributions of funds,  lab test results, and geological surveys. Figure 3.7 shows an example  of a table representing an event that we all have experienced at one  time or another—a doctor’s appointment.

Figure 3.7  A table representing an event  A table that stores data used to supply information is called a data  table, and it is the most common type of table in a relational database.  Data in this type of table is dynamic because you can manipulate it   modify, delete, and so forth  and process it into information in some  form or fashion. You’ll constantly interact with these types of tables as  you work with your database.  A validation table  also known as a lookup table , on the other hand,  stores data that you specifically use to implement data integrity. A val- idation table usually represents subjects, such as city names, skill cat- egories, product codes, and project identification numbers. Data in this  type of table is static because it will very rarely change at all. Although    52  Chapter 3  Terminology  you have very little direct interaction with these tables, you’ll frequently  use them indirectly to validate values that you enter into a data table.  Figure 3.8 shows an example of a validation table.  Categories  Category ID  Category Name  10000  20000  30000  40000  Accessories  Bikes  Clothing  Components  Figure 3.8  An example of a validation table  I’ll discuss validation tables in more detail in Chapter 11, “Business  Rules.”  Field  A field  known as an attribute in relational database theory  is the  smallest structure in the database and it represents a characteristic  of the subject of the table to which it belongs. Fields are the structures  that actually store data. The data in these fields can then be retrieved  and presented as information in almost any configuration that you  can imagine. The quality of the information you get from your data is  in direct proportion to the amount of time you’ve dedicated to ensur- ing the structural integrity and data integrity of the fields themselves.  There is just no way to underestimate the importance of fields.  Every field in a properly designed database contains one and only one  value, and its name will identify the type of value it holds. This makes  entering data into a field very intuitive. If you see fields with names  such as FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, CITY, STATE, and ZIPCODE, you know  exactly what type of values go into each field. You’ll also find it very  easy to sort the data by state or look for everyone whose last name is  “Hernandez.”   Structure-Related Terms  53  You’ll typically encounter three other types of fields in an improperly or  poorly designed database:  1. A multipart field  also known as a composite field , which con-  tains two or more distinct items within its value  2. A multivalued field, which contains multiple instances of the  same type of value  3. And a calculated field, which contains a concatenated text value  or the result of a mathematical expression  Figure 3.9 shows a table with an example of each of these types of  fields.

It is composed of the entire  set of fields in a table, regardless of whether the fields contain values.    54  Chapter 3  Terminology  Because of the manner in which a table is defined, each record is iden- tified throughout the database by a unique value in the primary key  field of that record.  In Figure 3.9, each record represents a unique client within the table,  and the CLIENT ID field will identify a given client throughout the data- base. In turn, each record includes all of the fields within the table,  and each field describes some aspect of the client represented by the  record. Consider the record for Timothy Ennis, for example. His record  represents a unique instance of the table’s subject  “Clients”  and  includes the total collection of fields in the table, treated as a unit. The  values of those fields represent relevant facts about Mr. Ennis that are  important to someone in the organization.  Records are a key factor in understanding table relationships because  you’ll need to know how a record in one table relates to other records  in another table.  View  A view is a “virtual” table composed of fields from one or more tables  in the database; the tables that comprise the view are known as base  tables. The relational model refers to a view as being “virtual” because  it draws data from base tables rather than storing data on its own. In  fact, the only information about a view that is stored in the database is  its structure. Many major RDBMS programs support views, but some   such as Microsoft Access  refer to them as saved queries. Your specific  RDBMS program will determine whether you refer to this object as a  query or a view.  Views enable you to see the information in your database from many  different aspects, providing you with a great amount of flexibility when  you work with your data. You can create views in a variety of ways  and they are especially useful when you base them on multiple related  tables. In a school scheduling database, for example, you could create    Structure-Related Terms  55  a view that consolidates data from the STUDENTS, CLASSES, and  CLASS SCHEDULES tables.  Figure 3.10 shows a view called INSTRUMENT ASSIGNMENTS that  is composed of fields taken from the STUDENTS, INSTRUMENTS,  and STUDENT INSTRUMENTS tables. The view displays data that  it draws from all of these tables simultaneously, based on matching  values between the STUDENT ID fields in the STUDENTS and STUDENT  INSTRUMENTS tables, and the INSTRUMENT ID fields in the INSTRU- MENTS and STUDENT INSTRUMENTS tables.

They enable you to work with data from multiple tables simul- taneously.  In order for a view to do this, the tables must have connections, or relationships, to one another.    56  Chapter 3  Terminology  2. They enable you to prevent certain users from viewing or  manipulating specific fields within a table or group of tables. This capability can be very advantageous in terms of security.  3. You can use them to implement data integrity. A view you use  for this purpose is known as a validation view.  You’ll learn more about designing and using views in Chapter 12,  “Views.”  ❖ Note  Although every major database vendor supports the type of view I’ve described in this section, several vendors are now supporting what is known as an indexed  or materialized  view. An indexed view is different from a “regular” view in that it does store data, and you can index its fields in order to improve the speed at which the RDBMS processes the view’s data. A full discussion of indexed views is beyond the scope of this book because it is a vendor-specific implementation issue. However, you should research this topic further if you are working with RDBMS software such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, or Sybase SQL, or if you are working within a data ware- house scenario.  Keys  Keys are special fields that play very specific roles within a table, and  the type of key determines its purpose within the table. There are  several types of keys a table may contain, but the two most significant  ones are the primary key and the foreign key.  A primary key is a field or group of fields that uniquely identifies each  record within a table; a primary key composed of two or more fields is  known as a composite primary key. The primary key is absolutely the  most important key in the entire table.   Structure-Related Terms  57   cid:129  A primary key value identifies a specific record throughout the  entire database.  entire database.   cid:129  The primary key field identifies a given table throughout the   cid:129  The primary key enforces table-level integrity and helps establish relationships with other tables in the database.  You’ll learn more about relationships in the next section.   Every table in your database should have a primary key!  The AGENT ID field in Figure 3.11 is a good example of a primary key.  It uniquely identifies each agent within the AGENTS table and helps  to guarantee table-level integrity by ensuring nonduplicate records. It  also establishes relationships between the AGENTS table and other  tables in the database, as in the case with the ENTERTAINERS table  shown in the example.

Figure 3.11  An example of primary and foreign key fields   58  Chapter 3  Terminology  When you determine that two tables bear a relationship to each other,  you typically establish the relationship by taking a copy of the primary  key from the first table and incorporating it into the structure of the  second table, where it becomes a foreign key. The name “foreign key” is  derived from the fact that the second table already has a primary key  of its own, and the primary key you are introducing from the first table  is “foreign” to the second table.  Figure 3.11 also shows a good example of a foreign key. Note that  AGENT ID is the primary key of the AGENTS table and a foreign key in  the ENTERTAINERS table. AGENT ID assumes this role because the  ENTERTAINERS table already has a primary key—ENTERTAINER ID. As  such, AGENT ID establishes the relationship between both of the tables.  Besides helping to establish relationships between pairs of tables,  foreign keys also help implement and ensure relationship-level integ- rity. This means that the records in both tables will always be properly  related because the values of a foreign key must match existing values  of the primary key to which it refers. Relationship-level integrity also  helps you avoid the dreaded “orphaned” record, a classic example of  which is an order record without an associated customer. If you don’t  know who made the order, you can’t process it, and you obviously can’t  invoice it. That’ll throw your quarterly sales off!  Key fields play an important part in a relational database, and you  must learn how to create and use them. You’ll learn more about pri- mary keys in Chapter 8, “Keys,” and Chapter 10, “Table Relationships.”  Index  An index is a structure that an RDBMS provides to improve data pro- cessing. Your particular RDBMS program will determine how the index  works and how you use it. However, an index has absolutely nothing to  do with the logical database structure! The only reason I include the term  index in this chapter is that people often confuse it with the term key.   Relationship-Related Terms  59  Index and key are just two more terms that are widely and frequently  misused throughout the database industry and in numerous data- base-related publications and web sites.  Remember my comments on  data and information?  You’ll always know the difference between the  two if you remember that keys are logical structures you use to identify  records within a table, and indexes are physical structures you use to  optimize data processing.  Relationship-Related Terms Relationships  A relationship exists between two tables when you can in some way  associate the records of the first table with those of the second. You  can establish the relationship via a set of primary and foreign keys  as  you learned in the previous section  or through a third table known  as a linking table  also known as an associative table . The manner in  which you establish the relationship really depends on the type of rela- tionship that exists between the tables.  You’ll learn more about that in  a moment.  While Figure 3.11 illustrated a relationship established via  primary foreign keys, Figure 3.12 illustrates a relationship established  with a linking table.  A relationship is an important component of a relational database.   cid:129  It enables you to create multitable views.   cid:129  It is crucial to data integrity because it helps reduce redundant  data and eliminate duplicate data.  You can characterize every relationship in three ways: by the type of  relationship that exists between the tables, the manner in which each  table participates, and the degree to which each table participates.   60  Chapter 3  Terminology  Students  Student ID  Student First Name  Student Last Name  Student Phone   >  60001  60002  60003  Zachary  Susan  Joe  Erlich  Black  Rosales  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  ......  ......  ......

Figure 3.12  A relationship established between two tables with the help of a  linking table  Types of Relationships  There are three specific types of relationship  traditionally known as a  cardinality  that can exist between a pair of tables: one-to-one, one-to- many, and many-to-many.  One-to-One Relationships  A pair of tables bears a one-to-one relationship when a single record  in the first table is related to only one record in the second table,  and a single record in the second table is related to only one record  in the first table. In this type of relationship, one table serves as a  “parent” table and the other serves as a “child” table. You establish  the relationship by taking a copy of the parent table’s primary key    Relationship-Related Terms  61  and incorporating it within the structure of the child table, where it  becomes a foreign key. This is a special type of relationship because  it is the only one in which both tables may actually share the same  primary key.  Figure 3.13 shows an example of a typical one-to-one relationship. In  this case, EMPLOYEES is the parent table and COMPENSATION is the  child table. The relationship between these tables is such that a single  record in the EMPLOYEES table can be related to only one record in  the COMPENSATION table, and a single record in the COMPENSATION  table can be related to only one record in the EMPLOYEES table. Note  that EMPLOYEE ID is indeed the primary key in both tables. However, it  will also serve the role of a foreign key in the child table.

The parent child model I used to describe   Erlich  Black  Rosales  3.5%  5.0%  5.0%   62  Chapter 3  Terminology  a one-to-one relationship works here as well. In this case, the table on  the “one” side of the relationship is the parent table, and the table on  the “many” side is the child table.  You establish a one-to-many rela- tionship by taking a copy of the parent table’s primary key and incor- porating it within the structure of the child table, where it becomes a  foreign key.  The example in Figure 3.14 illustrates a typical one-to-many relation- ship. A single record in the AGENTS table can be related to one or  more records in the ENTERTAINERS table, but a single record in the  ENTERTAINERS table is related to only one record in the AGENTS  table. As you probably have already guessed, AGENT ID is a foreign key  in the ENTERTAINERS table.

Figure 3.14  An example of a one-to-many relationship  This is by far the most common relationship that exists between a pair  of tables in a database. It is crucial from a data-integrity standpoint  because it helps to eliminate duplicate data and to keep redundant  data to an absolute minimum.   Relationship-Related Terms  63  Many-to-Many Relationships  A pair of tables bears a many-to-many relationship when a single  record in the first table can be related to many records in the second  table and a single record in the second table can be related to many  records in the first table. You establish this relationship with a linking  table.  You learned a little bit about this type of table at the begin- ning of this section.  A linking table makes it easy for you to associate  records from one table with those of the other and will help to ensure  you have no problems adding, deleting, or modifying related data. You  define a linking table by taking copies of the primary key of each table  in the relationship and using them to form the structure of the new  table. These fields actually serve two distinct roles: Together, they form  the composite primary key of the linking table; separately, they each  serve as a foreign key.  A many-to-many relationship that is not properly established is “unre- solved.” Figure 3.15 shows a classic and clear example of an unresolved  many-to-many relationship. In this instance, a single record in the   Student ID  Student First Name  Student Last Name  Student Phone   >  Erlich  Black  Rosales  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  ......  ......  ......

Figure 3.15  An example of an unresolved many-to-many relationship   64  Chapter 3  Terminology  STUDENTS table can be related to many records in the CLASSES  table and a single record in the CLASSES table can be related to many  records in the STUDENTS table.  This relationship is unresolved due to the inherent peculiarity of the  many-to-many relationship. The main issue is this: How do you easily  associate records from the first table with records in the second table?  To reframe the question in terms of the tables shown in Figure 3.15,  how do you associate a single student with several classes or a specific  class with several students? Do you insert a few STUDENT fields into the  CLASSES table? Or do you add several CLASS fields to the STUDENTS  table? Either of these approaches will make it difficult for you to work  with the data in those tables and will affect data integrity adversely.  The best approach for you to take is to create and use a linking table,  which will resolve the many-to-many relationship in the most appropri- ate and effective manner. Figure 3.16 shows this solution in practice.  Student ID  Student First Name  Student Last Name  Student Phone   >  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  ......  ......  ......

Figure 3.16  Resolving the many-to-many relationship with a linking table   Relationship-Related Terms  65  It’s important for you to know the type of relationship that exists  between a pair of tables because it determines how the tables are  related, whether or not records between the tables are interdependent,  and the minimum and maximum number of related records that can  exist within the relationship. You’ll learn much more about relation- ships in Chapter 10, “Table Relationships.”  Types of Participation  A table’s participation within a relationship can be either manda- tory or optional. Say there is a relationship between two tables called  TABLE_A and TABLE_B.   cid:129  TABLE_A’s participation is mandatory if you must enter at least  one record into TABLE_A before you can enter records into TABLE_B.   cid:129  TABLE_A’s participation is optional if you are not required to enter any records into TABLE_A before you can enter records into TABLE_B.  Let’s take a look at an example using the AGENTS and CLIENTS  tables in Figure 3.17. The AGENTS table has a mandatory participa- tion within the relationship if an agent must exist before you can enter  a new client into the CLIENTS table. However, the AGENTS table’s  participation is optional if there is no requirement for an agent to exist in  the table before you enter a new client into the CLIENTS table. You can  identify the appropriate type of participation for the AGENTS table by  determining how you’re going to use its data in relation to the data in  the CLIENTS table. For example, when you want to ensure that each  client is assigned to an available agent, you make the AGENTS table’s  participation within the relationship mandatory.   66  Chapter 3  Terminology  Agent ID  Agent First Name  Agent Last Name  Date of Hire  Agent Home Phone  Rosales  Horst  05 16 09  10 15 09  03 01 11  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  Samantha  Nathanson  Agents  Stella  Steve  100  101  102  Clients  Client ID  Agent ID  Client First Name  Client Last Name  Client Home Phone  9001  9002  9003  100  101  102  Stewart  Susan  Scott  Jameson  Black  Baker  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  Figure 3.17  The AGENTS and CLIENTS tables  Degree of Participation  The degree of participation determines the minimum number of records  that a given table must have associated with a single record in the  related table and the maximum number of records that a given table is  allowed to have associated with a single record in the related table.  Consider, once again, a relationship between two tables called  TABLE_A and TABLE_B. You establish the degree of participation for  TABLE_B by indicating a minimum and maximum number of records  in TABLE_B that can be related to a single record in TABLE_A. If a  single record in TABLE_A can be related to no less than one but no  more than ten records in TABLE_B, then the degree of participation for  TABLE_B is 1,10.  The notation for the degree of participation shows  the minimum number on the left and the maximum number on the  right, separated by a comma.  You can establish the degree of partic- ipation for TABLE_A in the same manner. You can identify the degree    Integrity-Related Terms  67  of participation for each table in a relationship by determining the way  the data in each table is related and how you’re using the data.  Consider the AGENTS and CLIENTS tables in Figure 3.17 once more.  If you require an agent to handle at least one client, but certainly no  more than eight, then the degree of participation for the CLIENTS table  is 1,8. When you want to ensure that a client can only be assigned  to one agent, then you indicate the degree of participation for the  AGENTS table as 1,1. You’ll learn how to indicate the degree of partici- pation for a given relationship in Chapter 10.  Integrity-Related Terms Field Specification  A field specification  traditionally known as a domain  represents all  the elements of a field. Each field specification incorporates three types  of elements: general, physical, and logical.   cid:129  General elements constitute the most fundamental information about the field and include items such as Field Name, Descrip- tion, and Parent Table.   cid:129  Physical elements determine how a field is built and how it is  represented to the person using it. This category includes items such as Data Type, Length, and Display Format.   cid:129  Logical elements describe the values stored in a field and include  items such as Required Value, Range of Values, and Default Value.  You’ll learn all of the elements associated with a field specification,  including those mentioned here, in Chapter 9, “Field Specifications.”   68  Chapter 3  Terminology  Data Integrity  Data integrity refers to the validity, consistency, and accuracy of the  data in a database. I cannot overstate the fact that the level of accu- racy of the information you retrieve from the database is in direct  proportion to the level of data integrity you impose upon the database.  Data integrity is one of the most important aspects of the database  design process, and you cannot underestimate, overlook, or even  partially neglect it. To do so would put you at risk of being plagued by  errors that are very hard to detect or identify. As a result, you would be  making important decisions on information that is inaccurate at best,  or totally invalid at worst.  There are four types of data integrity that you’ll implement during the  database design process. Three types of data integrity are based on  various aspects of the database structure and are labeled according to  the area  level  in which they operate. The fourth type of data integrity  is based on the way an organization perceives and uses its data. The  following is a brief description of each.  1. Table-level integrity  traditionally known as entity integrity   ensures that there are no duplicate records within the table and that the field that identifies each record within the table is unique and never null.  2. Field-level integrity  traditionally known as domain integrity   ensures that the structure of every field is sound; that the values in each field are valid, consistent, and accurate; and that fields of the same type  such as CITY fields  are consistently defined throughout the database.  3. Relationship-level integrity  traditionally known as referential  integrity  ensures that the relationship between a pair of tables is sound and that the records in the tables are synchronized whenever data is entered into, updated in, or deleted from either table.   Summary  69  4. Business rules impose restrictions or limitations on certain  aspects of a database based on the ways an organization per- ceives and uses its data. These restrictions can affect aspects of database design, such as the range and types of values stored in a field, the type of participation and the degree of partic- ipation of each table within a relationship, and the type of synchronization used for relationship-level integrity in certain relationships. All of these restrictions are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. Because business rules affect integrity, they must be considered along with the other three types of data integrity during the design process.  Summary  This chapter began with an explanation of why terminology is import- ant for defining, discussing, or reading about the relational database  model and the database design process.  The section on value-related terms showed you that there is a distinct  difference between data and information, and that understanding this  difference is crucial to understanding the database design process.  You now know quite a bit about nulls and how they affect information  you retrieve from the database.  Structure-related terms were covered next, and you learned that the  core structures of every relational database are fields, records, and  tables. You now know that views are virtual tables that are used, in  part, to work with data from two or more tables simultaneously. We  then looked at key fields, which are used to identify records uniquely  within a table and to establish a relationship between a pair of tables.  Finally, you learned the difference between a key field and an index.  Now you know that an index is strictly a software device used to opti- mize data processing.   70  Chapter 3  Terminology  In the section on relationship-related terms, you learned that a connec- tion between a pair of tables is known as a relationship. A relationship  is used to help ensure various aspects of data integrity, and it is the  mechanism used by a view to draw data from multiple tables. You then  learned about the three characteristics of table relationships: the type  of relationship  one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many , the type of  participation  optional or mandatory , and the degree of participation   minimum maximum number of related records .  The chapter ended with a discussion of integrity-related terms. Here you  learned that a field specification establishes the general, physical, and  logical characteristics of a field—characteristics that are an integral  part of every field in the database. You then learned that data integrity  is one of the most important aspects of the database design process  because of its positive effect on the data in the database. Also, you now  know that there are four types of data integrity—three based on data- base structure and one based on the way the organization interprets  and uses its data. These levels of integrity ensure the quality of your  database’s design and the accuracy of the information you retrieve  from it.  Review Questions  1. Why is terminology important?  2.

You can use the design methodology in this book to design a new data- base completely from scratch, refine an existing database, or help you  analyze an existing database so that you can design a new database  based on the results of your analysis.  ❖ Note  A database can be designed by a single individual or a design team composed of two or more individuals. Throughout the remainder of the book, I use the phrase database developer and the word developer to refer to the person or group designing the database.  The Importance of Completing the  Design Process  One thing I want to make perfectly clear from the very beginning is  the importance of completing the design process. I’m often asked if it’s  truly necessary to go through the entire design process. My answer is  always a resounding “Yes!” I’m then asked whether it’s still necessary  if someone is only going to create a “simple” database.  Simple is one  of the most dangerous words known to database developers. Nothing  is ever “simple.”  Again, my answer is yes, it’s still necessary. The type,  size, or purpose of the database is totally irrelevant to the value of  undertaking a fully developed design. You should implement and follow  the database design process from beginning to end.  It is a well-known and proven fact that it is a bad idea to attempt to  design a database without employing a thorough database design  process. Many database problems are caused by poor database design,  and partially following the design process is just about as bad as not  using it at all. An incomplete design is a poor design. Only if you follow    Defining a Mission Statement and Mission Objectives    77  through with a whole, unabbreviated design process are you assured a  sound structure and data integrity.  An important point to keep in mind is that the level of structural integ- rity and data integrity in your database is directly proportional to how  thoroughly you follow the design process. The less time you spend on  the design process, the greater the risk you run of encountering prob- lems with the database. Thoroughly following the database design pro- cess may not eliminate all of the problems you might encounter when  designing a database, but it will greatly help to minimize them. As you  work with your RDBMS software, you’ll find that a well-designed data- base is easier to implement than a poorly designed one.  Databases are not hard to design; it just takes a little time to design  them properly. Don’t allow yourself to take shortcuts when it seems as  if the design process is taking too long—just be patient and remember  what a wise old sage once said:  There’s never time to do it right, but there’s always time to do  it over!  Defining a Mission Statement  and Mission Objectives  The first phase in the database design process involves defining a  mission statement and mission objectives for the database. The mission  statement establishes the purpose of the database and provides you  with a distinct focus for your design work.  Every database is created for a specific purpose, whether it’s to solve  a particular business problem, to manage the daily transactions  of a business or organization, or to be used as part of an informa- tion system. You identify the purpose of your database and define it  within a mission statement. This will help ensure that you develop an    78   Chapter 4  Conceptual Overview  appropriate database structure and that you collect the data necessary  to support the intended purpose of the database.  You’ll also define mission objectives in this phase. These are statements  that represent the general tasks your users can perform against the  data in the database. You use these objectives to support your mission  statement and to help you determine various aspects of the database  structure.  There are two separate groups of people who will be involved in defin- ing the mission statement and the mission objectives. The first group  includes the database developer  you , the owner or head of the orga- nization, and management personnel, and it is responsible for defining  the mission statement. The second group includes the database devel- oper  you again , management personnel, and end users, and it will be  responsible for defining the mission objectives.  Analyzing the Current Database  The second phase in the database design process involves analyzing  the current database, if one exists. Depending on your organization,  the database will typically be a legacy database or a paper-based data- base. A legacy database  also known as an inherited database  is one  that has been in existence and in use for several years. A paper-based  database, as you may already know, is a loose collection of forms,  index cards, manila folders, and the like. Whatever the database type  or condition, analyzing it will yield valuable information about the  way your organization is currently using and managing its data. The  analysis also involves reviewing the way your organization is currently  collecting and presenting the data. You look at how your organization  uses paper to collect data  via forms  and present data  via reports . If  your organization uses some software application program to manage  and manipulate the data in the database, you study the way it collects    Analyzing the Current Database   79  and presents the data on-screen. Finally, you take into account how  if  at all  your organization is using its data on the Web, and you review  any browser-based applications that work with the database.  Another part of the analysis involves conducting interviews with users  and management to identify how they interact with the database on a  daily basis. As the database developer, you ask users how they work  with the database and what their information requirements are at  the current time. You then interview management personnel and ask  them about the information they currently receive and their perception  of the overall information requirements for the organization. These  interviews are an important component of your analysis because the  questions you ask  or don’t ask  will have a great impact on your final  database structure. You must conduct full and complete interviews if  you are to design a database that truly meets your organization’s infor- mation needs.  Next, you use the information you’ve gathered from the analysis and  the interviews to compile an initial list of fields. You then refine this  list by removing all calculated fields and placing them on their own  list—you’ll use these calculated fields later in the design process. The  refined list constitutes your organization’s fundamental data require- ments and provides a starting point for the design of a new database.   As you know, nothing is ever truly final. Rest assured that you’ll  extend and refine this field list further as you develop your design.   Once your initial field list is complete, you send it to your users and  management for a brief review and possible refinement. You encourage  feedback and take their suggestions for modifications into consider- ation. If you think the suggestions are reasonable and well supported,  you make the appropriate modifications, record the list in its current  state, and move on to the next phase.   80   Chapter 4  Conceptual Overview  Creating the Data Structures  Creating the data structures for the database is the third phase in the  database design process. You define tables and fields, establish keys,  and define field specifications for every field.  Tables are the first structures you define in the database. You deter- mine the various subjects that the tables will represent from the mis- sion objectives you wrote during the first phase of the design process  and the data requirements you gathered during the second phase.  Then you establish these subjects as tables and associate them with  fields from the field list you compiled during the second phase of the  design process. After you’ve completed this task, you review each table  to ensure that it represents only one subject and that it does not con- tain duplicate fields.  Now you go on to review the fields within each table. You refine all  multipart or multivalued fields in the table so that they each store  only a single value, and you move or delete fields that do not represent  distinct characteristics of the subject the table represents. When you  complete this review, you then review and refine the table structures.  This involves checking the work you performed on the fields to ensure  that you didn’t accidentally miss anything, and ensuring that each  table structure is properly defined. Next, you establish the appropriate  keys for each table. Your main task is to ensure that each table has a  properly defined primary key; this particular key uniquely identifies  each record within a table.  The final step in this phase is to establish field specifications for each  field in the database. Here you conduct interviews with users and  management to help you identify the specific field characteristics that  are important to them and review and discuss any characteristics with  which they may be unfamiliar. After you’ve completed these interviews,  you define and document field specifications for each field. You then    Determining and Defining Business Rules   81  review the table structures and field specifications with users and  management once more for possible refinements. The table structures  are ready for the next phase once you complete the refinements  if any   that you identified during the review.  Determining and Establishing Table  Relationships  The fourth phase of the database design process involves establishing  table relationships. You conduct interviews with users and manage- ment once again, identify relationships, identify relationship character- istics, and establish relationship-level integrity.  Working with users and management is a prudent exercise because  they can assist you in identifying relationships among the data. You  cannot possibly be familiar with every aspect of the data your orga- nization uses, so leveraging whatever knowledge they have about the  data they use will be very beneficial to you.  After you’ve identified the relationships, you establish a logical con- nection between the tables in each relationship with a primary key or  with a linking table. What you actually use depends upon the type of  relationship you’re establishing between the tables. Next, you deter- mine the type of participation and degree of participation for the tables  in each relationship. In some cases, these participation characteris- tics will be obvious to you due to the nature of the data stored in the  tables. In other cases, you’ll base the participation characteristics on  specific business rules.  Determining and Defining Business Rules  Determining and defining business rules is the fifth phase of the data- base design process. During this phase, you’ll hold interviews, identify    82   Chapter 4  Conceptual Overview  limitations on various aspects of the database, establish business  rules, and define and implement validation tables.  The manner in which your organization views and uses its data will  determine a set of limitations and requirements that you must build  into the database. Your interviews with users and management will  help you identify the specific constraints you will impose on the data,  data structures, or relationships. You then establish and document  these specifications as business rules.  The interviews you conduct with users will reveal specific limitations  on various aspects of the database. For example, a user working with  an order processing database is very aware of specific details, such  as the fact that a ship date must occur later than an order date; that  there must always be a daytime phone number; and that a shipping  method should always be indicated. Your interviews with management,  on the other hand, reveal general limitations on various aspects of the  database. For example, the office manager for an entertainment agency  is familiar with general issues such as the fact that an agent can rep- resent no more than 20 entertainers and that promotional information  for each entertainer must be updated every year.  Next, you define and implement validation tables as necessary to sup- port certain business rules. Suppose you find that certain fields have  a finite range of values because of the manner in which your organi- zation uses them. You can use validation tables to ensure the consis- tency and validity of the values stored in those fields.  The level of integrity that business rules establish at this point is  significant because it relates directly to the way your organization  views and uses its data. The organization’s perspective on the data  will change as the organization grows, which means that the business  rules must change as well. Determining and establishing business  rules is an ongoing, iterative process, and you must be constantly dili- gent if you are going to maintain this level of integrity properly.   Reviewing Data Integrity   83  Determining and Defining Views  The sixth phase of the design process involves determining and defin- ing views. Here you’ll conduct interviews  once again , identify various  ways of working with the data, and establish the views.  You identify the types of views you need to build in the database by  interviewing users and management and determining how they work  with their respective data. You may find, for example, that many users  require detailed information to perform their work, while others need  only summary information to help them make strategic decisions for  the organization. Each group of users must access information in very  specific ways, and you can use views to accommodate these situations.  Next, you define the views you’ve identified during the interview pro- cess using the appropriate tables and fields, and establish criteria  for those views that are required to retrieve specific information. For  instance, you would establish criteria for a view that must list all cus- tomers located in Texas or a view that must display the total number of  authorized vendors  by city  in Washington.  Reviewing Data Integrity  The seventh and final phase in the database design process involves  reviewing the final database structure for data integrity.  First, you review each table to ensure that it meets the criteria of a  properly designed table and you check the fields within each table for  proper structure. You then resolve any inconsistencies or problems you  encounter and review the structures once more. After you’ve made the  appropriate refinements, you check table-level integrity.  Second, you review and check the field specifications for each field. You  make necessary refinements to the fields and then check field-level    84   Chapter 4  Conceptual Overview  integrity. This review reaffirms the field-level integrity you identified  and established earlier in the database design process.  Third, you review the validity of each relationship, confirm the rela- tionship type, and confirm the participation characteristics for each  table within the relationship. You then review relationship integrity to  ensure that there are matching values between shared fields and that  there are no problems inserting, updating, or deleting data in either of  the tables within the relationship.  Finally, you review the business rules that you identified earlier in the  database design process and confirm the constraints you’ve placed on  various aspects of the database. If there are any other limitations that  have come to your attention since the last set of personnel interviews,  you establish them as new business rules and add them to the existing  set of business rules.  You’re ready to implement your logical database structure in an  RDBMS program once you’ve completed the entire database design  process. However, the process is never really complete because the  database structure will always need refinement as your organization  evolves.  Summary  We began this chapter with a discussion of the importance of com- pleting the design process, and you learned that designing a database  without the benefit of a good design method leads to poor and improper  design. We also discussed the fact that the level of structural and  data integrity is in direct proportion to how thoroughly you follow the  design process. You then learned that inconsistent data and inaccurate  information are two problems typically associated with poorly designed  databases.   Summary  85  Next we looked at an overview of the entire database design process.  The process was consolidated into the following phases in order to pro- vide you with a clear picture of the general steps involved in designing  a database.  1. Define a mission statement and mission objectives for the data- base. The mission statement defines the purpose of the data- base, and the mission objectives define the tasks that are to be performed by users against the data in the database.  2. Analyze the current database. You identify your organization’s  data requirements by reviewing the way your organization cur- rently collects and presents its data and by conducting inter- views with users and management to determine how they use the database on a daily basis.  3. Create the data structures. You establish tables by identifying the subjects that the database will track. Next, you associate each table with fields that represent distinct characteristics of the table’s subject, and you designate a particular field  or group of fields  as the primary key. You then establish field specifica- tions for every field in the table.  4. Determine and establish table relationships. You identify relation-  ships that exist between the tables in the database and estab- lish the logical connection for each relationship using primary keys and foreign keys or by using linking tables. Then you set the appropriate characteristics for each relationship.  5. Determine and define business rules. You conduct interviews  with users and management to identify constraints that must be imposed upon the data in the database. The manner in which your organization views and uses its data typically deter- mines the types of constraints you must impose on the data- base. You then declare these constraints as business rules, and they will serve to establish various levels of data integrity.   86   Chapter 4  Conceptual Overview  6. Determine and establish views. You interview users and man-  agement to identify the various ways they work with the data in the database. When your interviews are complete, you establish views as appropriate. You define each view using the appropriate tables and fields, and you establish criteria for those views that must display a limited or finite set of records.  7. Review data integrity. This phase involves four steps. First, you review each table to ensure that it meets proper design criteria. Second, you review and check all field specifications. Third, you test the validity of each relationship. Fourth, you review and confirm the business rules.  Review Questions  1. Why is it important to complete the design process thoroughly?  2.

Interestingly enough, you start the process by defining the  end result. It is in the very first step of the database design process that  you identify and declare the purpose of the database. You also define  and declare a list of the tasks that your users can perform against the  data in the database. Both of these items provide you with a focus and  direction for developing a database, and they help ensure that your  final database structure supports the stated purpose and tasks.  Conducting Interviews  Interviews are an integral part of database design and they play a  key role during certain phases of the design process. Assuming that   89   90   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  you work within some organization and need to design a database to  support the work that you and your fellow employees perform, you  should make certain that you conduct your interviews in the manner  described in this book. This means that you’ll interact with some of  your fellow employees, management personnel, and the owner  depend- ing on the size of the organization  throughout the design process.  If you work for a small organization that employs only a handful of  people or if you are only creating a database for yourself, you’ll conduct  “self-interviews”; you’ll still conduct the interviews described in this  book, but you will act as the interviewer and the interviewee. You will  be the one who provides the answers to the questions.  ❖ Note  Interviewing is a skill that you can learn with some amount of patience, diligence, and practice. There are a vari- ety of approaches and techniques you can use to conduct an interview, and there are numerous academic papers, articles, and books that have been written on the subject. An in-depth discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this book, but I’ve included several techniques and guidelines in this chapter that will help you conduct your interviews efficiently and effectively.  Interviews are important because they provide a valuable communica- tion link between you  the developer  and the people for whom you’re  designing the database, help ensure the success of your design efforts,  and provide critical information that can affect the design of the data- base structure. As you’re working with table relationships, for exam- ple, you might find it difficult to determine the type of participation  and degree of participation for a specific relationship. The only way for  you to determine the proper values for these relationship character- istics is to conduct an interview with the appropriate people in your  organization. You can then use the information you gathered during  the interview to set the relationship characteristics. You can use an    Conducting Interviews  91  interview as an information-gathering tool to gain new insights from  participants regarding part of the database or to clarify facts that you  don’t understand. Note that you must always conduct each of the inter- views incorporated within this design process, regardless of the type  of database you’re designing or the number of people involved. You will  inevitably miss some piece of important information when you neglect  or omit any of the interviews, and this could adversely affect the final  structure of your database.  ❖ Note  Throughout the remaining chapters, I use open-ended questions for all interviews that are part of the concept or tech- nique under discussion. You can use these questions as a guide for formulating your own questions for a given interview.  Always establish guidelines for your interviews before you conduct them.  This will help ensure that you conduct your interviews in a consistent  manner and that they are always  or usually  successful. Here are  some guidelines you can establish for the participants and for yourself.  Participant Guidelines   cid:129  Make the participants aware of your intentions. Many people are  wary of interviews. They don’t like to be “put on the spot” and they don’t want to be asked “trick” questions. Let each person know the subject you wish to discuss, the names of the other participants, the time you want to start the session, and whether this interview is part of an ongoing series of interviews. Every- one in a given interview session is more likely to engage in the conversation at hand and be quite responsive to your questions if they know how you’re going to conduct the session and what you expect of them. Above all, reassure them that the interview is not a disguised assessment of their performance; you want to make   92   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  certain they feel comfortable talking to you openly and without  reservation. This will go a long way toward building a foundation  of trust between you and the participants.   cid:129  Let the participants know that you appreciate their participation in  the interview and that their responses to the interview questions are valuable to the overall design project. Earlier experiences are likely to make some people believe that whatever input they pro- vide at work goes unnoticed and unappreciated. Even when their input did make a significant impact on a specific project, rarely did they get so much as a “Thank you.” In light of this, there’s no real motivation for them to participate in your interview. Many, if not all, of your participants are likely to start out with this atti- tude, but you can really increase their motivation by letting them know that you sincerely and honestly appreciate their participa- tion and are very interested in their responses. Assure them that their feedback is truly valuable to the design process and that in many cases their responses can substantiate and validate deci- sions made throughout the design process. The participants will be more apt to help you in any way they can if you make yourself credible by being genuinely sincere; your job will be much easier and everyone will participate voluntarily and enthusiastically. It’s also very effective to show, on a second interview, how you have already used participants’ earlier contributions.   cid:129  Make sure everyone understands that you are the official arbitra-  tor if and when a dispute arises. It’s inevitable that minor dis- putes will arise during an interview and that there will be some amount of tension until such disputes are resolved. You can avoid this situation by arbitrating these disputes yourself. As the database developer, you’re in the best position to do this because you have an objective viewpoint and can see both sides of an issue. Additionally, the decision you make will always be in the best interests of the database structure. Always remember that   Conducting Interviews  93  disputes dealing with something other than the database struc- ture can and should be referred to a more appropriate authority,  if one exists.  Interviewer Guidelines  These Are for You    cid:129  Conduct the interview in a well-lit room, separated from distract-  ing noise, with a large table and comfortable chairs. You’ll greatly enhance your chances of carrying out a successful interview when you pay attention to atmosphere—you’ll be surprised how much of a difference this makes to the tone and energy of the meeting. Use a well-lit room because it allows the participants to read your interview materials very easily. A large table ensures that everyone has space to work, and comfortable chairs keep them relaxed enough to concentrate on the conversation at hand.  The business climate has changed considerably since I first wrote this book and the subsequent second edition. Many people are now conducting interviews and meetings remotely via the computer and in more public places, such as restaurants or the local Starbucks; these are all great options if you can’t devise an appropriate setting for your interviews. Many companies are more frequently moving certain meetings off-site and into hotel conference rooms, after finding that it can be quite advanta- geous and beneficial to get people away from their daily work environments.   cid:129  Set a limit of ten people for each interview. Limiting the number  of participants promotes a more relaxed atmosphere and makes it easier for you to encourage everyone to participate. One prob- lem you’ll find in conducting an interview with a large number of people is that the intimidation level of some of the participants will rise in direct proportion to the number of participants taking part in the interview as a whole. Some people are just afraid of looking ignorant or incompetent in front of their colleagues,   94   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  regardless of whether there’s truly any justification for such  feelings. As such, you do have a very good reason to restrict the  number of participants in an interview.   cid:129  Conduct separate interviews for users and management. Separat- ing the two groups is a good idea for a variety of reasons, includ- ing the “fear factor” noted in the preceding item. Primarily, you want to separate them because each group has a different per- spective on the organization as a whole and how the organization uses its data on a daily basis. Conducting separate interviews for each group allows you to leverage their unique perspectives to your advantage as you work through the database design pro- cess. Another reason for keeping the interviews separate is to eliminate the conflicts that can arise when these groups disagree about certain aspects of the organization. It’s quite common for there to be a lack of communication between them and the odds are 50 50 that the interview will bring this problem to the sur- face. This may impel them to establish better lines of communi- cation or it may exacerbate the problem further. In any case, this communication problem can complicate and extend your inter- view and diffuse its results. Use your knowledge of the organiza- tion to help you judge whether to keep the interviews separate. If you need to conduct an interview with both groups at the same time, do so intentionally, with a specific purpose in mind, and be prepared for distractions.   cid:129  When you have to interview several groups of people, designate a  group leader for each group. The group leader will help you ensure that the interview runs smoothly. She will be responsible for preparing each member of her group for the interview and for providing you with any new information she obtained from the group outside of the interview. During the interview, the group leader can direct your questions to the member best equipped to answer them.   Conducting Interviews  95  You’ll occasionally encounter a group leader who may want to  dominate the interview and answer every one of your questions.  When this happens, diplomatically and politely inform him that  it is your job  and duty  to obtain feedback from all of the partic- ipants so that you can make a complete assessment of the orga- nization’s overall information requirements. If this doesn’t rectify  the problem, you have the option of refraining from including  him in future interviews or designating someone else as the  group leader.   cid:129  Prepare your questions prior to the interview. You can conduct an  interview rather easily if you have a set of prepared questions.  Coming up with questions off the top of your head is rarely a good idea, even if you’re an experienced interviewer and are highly skilled at producing ad hoc questions.  Having a prepared list of questions allows you to provide a focus and direction for the interview, and it provides the participant with a continuity of thought. Your interview will flow more smoothly and will be more productive when your questions move easily from topic to topic.  As you prepare your list of interview questions, make sure you use open-ended questions. For example, “Did you feel our ser- vice was  a  poor,  b  average, or  c  good?” is a closed question. A closed question isn’t particularly useful because it supplies its own set of responses and does not allow an interviewee to pro- vide an objective opinion or elaborate answer. On the other hand, an open-ended question such as “How do you feel about our service?” is far more useful because it allows the interviewee to answer the question in a variety of ways. There are times when you may need to use closed questions, but it’s better to use them intentionally, sparingly, and with a specific purpose in mind.   cid:129  If you’re not very good at taking notes, either assign that task to a  dependable transcriber for each interview or get the group’s permis- sion to use a digital  or voice  recorder to record the interview. You   96   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  conduct interviews to gather specific information about the orga- nization, so it’s important that you establish a detailed record  of each interview. If you find it difficult to conduct an interview  and take notes at the same time, you should enlist one of the  participants as your assistant and have him take notes for you.   This is one good way to encourage participation from people who  are normally quiet or reserved.  Choose your assistant carefully  because the notes may suffer if he is at all distracted by the  proceedings. Another option you have available is to use a digital  recorder to record the interview. This might prove to be a better  way to handle your notes because the digital recorder will cap- ture the interview more accurately, and you’ll be able to deter- mine exactly who provided you with a given piece of information.   Be sure you first obtain permission from each participant if you  do decide to record the interview. There may be privacy or confi- dentiality issues at stake and you don’t want to get yourself into  any kind of trouble.    cid:129  Give everyone your equal and undivided attention. This is a cru-  cial point for you to remember—you must pay complete attention to the person who is speaking, and do so sincerely. If you give a participant the impression that you’re bored, uninterested, or preoccupied, he will immediately reduce his level of participation within the interview. On the other hand, he will probably partic- ipate quite enthusiastically if he sees that you are interested in what he’s saying and has your undivided attention.  I’m sure you know that there will be times when a participant responds to your questions with vague or incomplete answers. He may respond this way for several reasons. It may be that he doesn’t quite know how to express the ideas he wants to convey or that he’s not at liberty to divulge certain information. It could also be that he’s just not comfortable talking about himself and what he does or that he is suspicious of you for some reason.   Conducting Interviews  97  You’ll just have to be patient and make him feel at ease so that he  will provide you with the information you need. For example, you  could try to state your best approximation of what he’s said thus  far and ask if it is what he meant to say.   cid:129  Keep the pace of the interview moving. You’ve probably attended  meetings during which a particular point was belabored or much time was spent trying to extract information from a reluctant participant. You can prevent this from happening during your interviews by setting personal limits on the time you’ll allow for a question to be answered and the time you’ll spend on a specific topic. Don’t inform the participants about this limit; instead, indicate that you’ll table the point for now so that the meeting can proceed. Be sure you get in touch with the owner of the database soon after the meeting so that you can come to a final conclusion and resolution to the issue.   cid:129  Always maintain control of the interview. This is the single most  important guideline for every interview you conduct. Inevita- bly, something goes wrong the moment you lose control of the interview. For instance, say you have a situation where one of the participants begins to change the focus of the interview by discussing issues that have little or no relevance to the topics on your agenda. You’ll certainly lose control of the interview unless you do something to redirect the discussion. Regaining control of the interview will be easy for you to do in some cases, but in oth- ers you’ll just have to declare your portion of the interview “com- plete” and let the participants carry on with their discussion. You can avoid situations like this so long as you maintain control of the interview.  Interviews are an integral part of the design process and I provide  examples of them throughout the next several chapters. You’ll find  sample dialogue that illustrates typical interview scenarios and  examples of questions you might use during a given interview.  The    98   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  sample questions always relate to the type of interview you’re currently  conducting.   ❖ Note  The purpose of an interview example is to illustrate the techniques you use to conduct a specific type of interview, and I’ve kept the dialogue relatively simple for this reason. Use the dialogue as a means of coming up with good ideas for the types of conversations you conduct in the interview.  One final point: Keep in mind that the guidelines I’ve presented in this  section are merely recommendations. I suspect that you won’t be able  to apply all of these guidelines to every interview you conduct or even  apply them to the extent to which I’ve described. I would, however,  expect you to apply them fully in an ideal situation. Yes, I know—you  don’t come across ideal situations all the time. Neither do I. But you  can still make it your goal to meet as many of these guidelines as pos- sible. In the end, the person who stands to gain the most is you.  THE CASE STUDY: MIKE’S BIKES  There are numerous examples throughout the book that illustrate the  concepts and techniques used in the database design process. I’ve  drawn these examples from a variety of databases and used them in  an arbitrary fashion. Using them in this manner allows me to demon- strate that once you learn how to apply a particular concept or tech- nique generically, you can then apply it to any other database you’re  designing. Your focus, then, should always be on the concept or tech- nique being presented, not on the example itself.  Nevertheless, I use a single database example as a case study to illus- trate the steps involved in the design process. This enables me to pres- ent the process with some degree of continuity. As the database design    Conducting Interviews  99  process unfolds, I apply each technique to designing the database for  the fictitious company in the case study. I provide only a few details  about the company in this chapter, but I’ll supply more as I present  each new concept or technique.  Mike’s Bikes, our case-study business, is a new bike shop located in  a small suburb called Greenlake, not far from downtown Seattle. It  has been open for only two months, and business is growing steadily.  Mike, the shop’s owner, has been conducting his daily business on  paper. He records sales on preprinted forms, maintains employee and  vendor information on sheets of paper  storing them in folders , and  writes information about his regular customers on index cards. As a  result, Mike spends a lot of time maintaining all of this data. He owns  a computer but uses it mainly to play games, watch videos on YouTube,  write email, keep in touch with friends on Facebook, and visit various  golf sites. The only business-related task he performs on the com- puter is keeping track of the bike shop’s inventory using a spreadsheet  program.  Recently, Mike learned that using a database would be a good way  to store and work with data related to his business. Using a data- base would greatly diminish the amount of time he currently spends  maintaining his data, and he could always ensure that the data is  up-to-date and that the information is accurate. Although he thinks a  database is a good idea, he’s aware of the fact that he doesn’t know the  first thing about properly designing one. Undaunted, Mike has decided  to hire a database consultant to design the database for him.  You are, in this fable, the consultant he has hired for the project.  As the database design process unfolds throughout the next several  chapters, you’ll apply each technique to design the database for Mike’s  Bikes. As you learn new concepts or techniques, Mike will supply you  with the information you need to complete the design of his database.   100   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  Defining the Mission Statement  In the previous chapter, you learned that the mission statement  declares the specific purpose of the database in general terms and that  you define it at the beginning of the database design process. Further- more, it provides you with a focus for your design efforts and keeps you  from getting diverted and making the database structure unnecessar- ily large or complex.  The Well-Written Mission Statement  A good mission statement is succinct and to the point. Verbose state- ments have a tendency to be confusing, ambiguous, or vague; they do  more to obscure the purpose of the database than to clarify it. Here is  an example of a typical mission statement:  The purpose of the New Starz Talent Agency database is to maintain  the data we generate, and to supply information that supports the  engagement services we provide to our clients and the management  services we provide to our entertainers.  This mission statement is well defined and uncluttered by unnecessary  statements or details. It is a very general statement, just as it should  be. Think of a mission statement as the flame of a candle located  at the end of a dark tunnel. The light produced by the flame guides  you to the end of the tunnel, so long as you focus on it. In the same  manner, the mission statement guides you to the end of the database  design process. Guided by your mission statement, you can focus on  designing a database structure that will support the declared purpose  of the database.  A well-written mission statement is free of phrases or sentences that  explicitly describe specific tasks. If your mission statement contains  these types of phrases or sentences, remove them and rewrite the  statement. Be sure to keep the discarded phrases handy, though,  because you may be able to use them to formulate mission objectives.    Defining the Mission Statement   101   You’ll learn about mission objectives in the next section.  Here’s an  example of a poorly worded mission statement:  The purpose of the Whatcom County Hearing Examiner’s database  is to keep track of applications for land use, maintain data on appli- cants, keep a record of all hearings, keep a record of all decisions,  keep a record of all appeals, maintain data on department employees,  and maintain data for general office use.  It should be immediately apparent that there are a few things wrong  with this mission statement.   cid:129  It’s slightly verbose. Remember that the ideal mission statement  should be succinct and to the point.   cid:129  The specific purpose of the database is unclear. This mission  statement is written in such a way that it is difficult for you to ascertain the specific purpose of the database.   cid:129  It describes several specific tasks. Two issues arise when a mis- sion statement is written in this manner. First, the description of the tasks does nothing to define the specific purpose of the database. Second, the statement somehow appears to be incom- plete. It raises the question, “Are there any tasks we’ve forgotten to include in the mission statement?”  You can fix this mission statement by removing the references to spe- cific tasks  be sure to save them for the next step  and rewriting the  statement. Here is an example of one of the possible ways you could  rewrite this mission statement:  The purpose of the Whatcom County Hearing Examiner’s database is  to maintain the data the examiner’s office uses to make decisions on  land-use requests submitted by citizens of Whatcom County.  Notice how the purpose of the database has become much clearer in  this version. Also note that the statement is more succinct and doesn’t  give the impression of being incomplete. You’ll always have a clear    102   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  focus during the database design process when you formulate your  mission statements in this manner.  Composing a Mission Statement  The process of creating a mission statement involves conducting  an interview with the owner or manager of the organization, learn- ing about the organization, and determining the purpose of the new  database.  You conduct the interview for this step with the owner of the organi- zation or, if he directs, the appropriate staff. Either will be able to help  you define the statement because each has an overall understanding of  the organization and a general comprehension of why the database is  necessary in the first place. Besides helping you to define the mission  statement, this interview will also provide a great deal of information  about the organization itself. This information is valuable because you  can use it later in the design process.  Encourage the interview participant to discuss as many facets of the  organization as she can, even if the discussion relates to issues that  aren’t directly relevant to the database. The idea here is for you to  understand what the organization does and how it functions; the more  you understand an organization, the better prepared you will be to  design a database that will fulfill its needs. The organization’s general  need for a database will become clear to you once you have a better  understanding of the organization itself. You can then translate this  need into a mission statement.  Be sure to ask open-ended questions during the interview. In some  cases, a good question can prompt the participant to state the purpose  of the database without much effort. For example, say you posed the  following question:  “How would you describe the purpose of your organization to a new  client?”   Defining the Mission Statement   103  This is a good open-ended question because it focuses on the issue  yet gives the participant the freedom to respond with what she feels is  a complete answer. Furthermore, this type of question will typically  generate a response that you can translate directly into a mission  statement.  Now assume you received the following reply:  “We supply entertainment services to our clientele for any and all  occasions. We take care of all the details for the engagement so that it  is as worry-free for the client as possible.”  You can easily rewrite this type of response and turn it into a mission  statement. When a response such as this one consists of two or more  sentences or phrases, one of the sentences or phrases typically indi- cates the purpose of the database. For example, you can use the first  sentence from the preceding reply to construct the mission statement.  Here is one of several ways you could rewrite the reply:  The purpose of the All-Star Talent database is to maintain the data  we use in support of the entertainment services we provide to our  clientele.  The most important point to remember is that the mission statement  should make sense to you  the database developer  and to those for  whom you are designing the database. Different groups of people have  different ways of phrasing statements, and the specific wording of  the statement can depend greatly on industry-specific terminology.  Your mission statement is complete when you have a sentence that  describes the specific purpose of the database and that is understood  and agreed upon by everyone concerned.  Here are a few sample questions that you can use to arrive at your  mission statement:  How would you describe the purpose of your organization to a new  client?   104   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  What would you say is the purpose of your organization?  What is the major function of your organization?  How would you describe what your organization does?  How would you define the single most important reason for the exis- tence of your organization?  What is the main focus of your organization?  You may have noticed that some of these questions seem to be the  same question rewritten in a different manner. Keep in mind that the  observation regarding the phrasing of mission statements also applies  to the interview questions you’ll use throughout the database design  process. You can pose the same question to several people and receive  different responses because each person may interpret the meaning of  the question a little differently. In some cases, you may just get a long  “I haven’t had my first espresso yet” type of stare. Experiment with dif- ferent types of phrasing and determine which type works best for you.  Your method of constructing and posing questions may be different  from someone else’s, but it doesn’t matter so long as you have a method  that suits you.  CASE STUDY: DEFINING A MISSION  STATEMENT FOR MIKE’S BIKES  Now you need to define a mission statement for Mike’s Bikes. Before  you can define the mission statement, you must conduct an interview  with the owner to gather information about his business. Assume you  have an assistant named Zachary who is conducting the interview for  you. The interview may go something like this:  ZACHARY:  “Can you tell me why you believe you need a database?” “I think we need a database just to keep track of all our  MIKE:  inventory. I’d also like to keep track of all our sales as well.”   Defining the Mission Objectives   105  ZACHARY:  “I’m sure the database will address those issues. Now,  what would you say is the single most important func- tion of your business?” “To provide a wide array of bicycle products and bicy- cle-related services to our customers. We have a lot of  great customers. And regular ones too! They’re our big- gest asset.”  MIKE:    The interview continues until Zachary has finished asking all the  questions on his list.   After the interview, review the information you’ve gathered and define  the mission statement. You can ascertain a few points from the previ- ous dialogue with Mike, such as the fact that he’ll need to be able to  track products, customers, and customer sales. But the most valuable  point is provided by his reply to the second question. You can use the  first sentence in that reply to formulate the mission statement. Taking  into account some of the other points you’ve identified in the interview,  you can rewrite Mike’s reply to create the following mission statement:  The purpose of the Mike’s Bikes database is to maintain the data we  need to support our retail sales business and our customer service  operations.  When you believe you have a good mission statement, review it with  Mike and make sure that he understands and agrees with the declared  purpose of the database. When you and Mike are satisfied with the  mission statement, you can go on to the next step, which is to define  the mission objectives.  Defining the Mission Objectives  To expand upon the overview in the previous chapter, mission objec- tives are statements that represent the general tasks supported by the  data maintained in the database. Each mission objective represents    106   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  a single task. These mission objectives provide information that you’ll  use throughout the database design process. For example, mission  objectives help you define table structures, field specifications, rela- tionship characteristics, and views. They also help you establish data  integrity and define business rules. Finally, mission objectives guide  your development efforts and ensure that your final database structure  supports the mission statement.  Well-Written Mission Objectives  A well-written mission objective is a declarative sentence that clearly  defines a general task and is free from unnecessary details. It is  expressed in general terms, succinct and to the point, and unambigu- ous. Here are some examples of typical mission objectives:  Maintain complete patient address information.  Keep track of all customer sales.  Make sure an account representative is responsible for no more than  20 accounts at any given time.  Keep track of vehicle maintenance.  Produce employee phone directories.  These mission objectives are well defined and easy to understand.  Each mission objective represents a single general task and defines  the task clearly without unnecessary details. For example, the last  mission objective in the list states that employee directories need to be  produced, but it doesn’t indicate how they are to be produced. It is not  necessary to indicate how the employee directories will be produced  because that issue is part of the application development process.  Remember that the purpose of a mission objective is to help define  various structures within the database and to help guide the overall  direction of the database’s development.   Defining the Mission Objectives   107  If a mission objective represents more than one general task, you  should decompose it into two or more mission objectives. Here is an  example of a poorly written mission objective:  We need to keep track of the entertainers we represent and the type of  entertainment they provide, as well as the engagements that we book  for them.  There are two problems with this mission objective.  1.  2.  It defines more than a single general task. It is clear that there are two tasks represented in this statement—keeping track of entertainers and keeping track of engagements.  It contains unnecessary detail. It’s unnecessary to refer to the entertainer’s “type of entertainment” in this mission objective. The phrase type of entertainment either refers to a distinct char- acteristic of an entertainer, or represents a new task that should be declared as a mission objective. If it refers to a distinct characteristic of an entertainer, it should be removed from the statement; otherwise, it should be used as the basis for a new mission objective.  You can fix this mission objective by removing the unnecessary detail  and rewriting it as two mission objectives.  Keep the details you dis- card on a separate list; they may be useful later in the design process.   Here is an example of one possible revision:  Maintain complete entertainer information.  Keep track of all the engagements we book.  Notice that each mission objective now clearly defines a single general  task and is easy to understand as well. Mission objectives such as  these are easy to use as you design the database.   108   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  Composing Mission Objectives  Defining mission objectives is a process that involves conducting inter- views with users and management and then writing appropriate mis- sion objectives based on the information gathered from the interviews.  The purpose of the interview is to determine what types of general  tasks need to be supported by the data in the database. You accom- plish this by asking the participants open-ended questions and  allowing them to elaborate on their replies as necessary. The mission  statement and mission objectives interviews are the easiest ones you’ll  conduct during the design process because everyone is usually enthu- siastic about participating.  In my experience, at least.  It’s fairly easy  to get people to discuss what they do on a daily basis and to give their  perspective on the function of the organization. This is also one of the  few interviews you’ll conduct with both users and management; there  should be a lot of common ground between the two groups due to the  general nature of the interview.  One very important point to remember is that the interviews you con- duct here involve very general discussions. The discussions are more  conceptual than analytical; your intent here is not to analyze the cur- rent database or database application, but to get an overall idea of the  general tasks the database should support. Keep in mind that one of  the purposes of the mission objectives is to help guide the development  of the database structure.  As you conduct the interview, be sure, once again, to ask open-ended  questions. Remember that open-ended questions are apt to elicit  better responses from your participants. Ask the participants ques- tions regarding their daily work, how the organization functions, and  what type of issues they believe need to be addressed by the data- base. Encourage them to discuss as many facets of their work and the  organization as they possibly can. As they reply, try to record each  response as a declarative sentence. You’ll find it is much easier to    Defining the Mission Objectives   109  transform a sentence into a mission objective if you can do this. Here  are just a few examples of the types of questions you could pose during  the interview:  What kind of work do you perform on a daily basis?  How would you define your job description?  What kind of data do you work with?  What types of reports do you generate?  What types of things do you keep track of?  What types of services does your organization provide?  How would you describe the type of work you do?  All of these questions are likely to evoke a good, lengthy response from  the participant. One of the advantages of questions like these is that  they provide the opportunity for you to ask follow-up questions. For  example, say you received the following response to the last question in  the list:  “First, I try to determine the general problem with the vehicle. Then I  fill out a work order and note my assessment of the problem. Finally, I  send the vehicle to the next available service team.”  You’ll immediately notice that it’s a lengthy response, which is fine. You  should also note that you could easily ask a follow-up question, such  as the following:  “Is there any type of customer information incorporated within the  procedure you just described?”  Even if the reply is “No,” the question is still open-ended enough for the  participant to elaborate further on his original response. This type of  follow-up question could also jar his memory and cause him to relay  other information, which may be related to the subject of the original  response.   110   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  Here is a set of mission objectives that you could derive from the par- ticipant’s original response:  Maintain information on customer vehicles.  Keep track of work orders.  Maintain information on our service teams.  Maintain information on our mechanics.  Maintain information on our customers.  Three of these objectives are derived directly from the response.  They’re easy for you to determine because their subjects are explic- itly stated in the response itself. The last two mission objectives are  derived from assumptions based on the response. This is a technique   which you can think of as “reading between the lines”  that experi- enced database designers use quite often, and it is one that you should  use when you’re defining mission objectives. The technique relies on  your ability to determine what information a response conveys implic- itly, as well as what it conveys explicitly. So pay attention. Listen for  implications. Without good assumptions, your overall set of mission  objectives could be incomplete.  Review the following response and determine whether there is implicit  information hidden within the response itself:  “I book entertainment for our clientele, which consists of commercial  and noncommercial clients. Our noncommercial clients are typically  individuals or small groups who book weddings, birthdays, anniversa- ries, and the like. Our commercial clients, on the other hand, consist  of businesses such as nightclubs and corporations. The nightclubs  book entertainment in six-week slots; the corporations book things  such as corporate parties, product rollouts, and various types of pro- motional functions.”  Aside from the explicit information that this response conveys, there  are at least two pieces of implicit information that you can uncover in    Defining the Mission Objectives   111  this response. The first piece of implicit information concerns the need  to maintain information on the entertainers booked for the engage- ments. An agent needs to know things such as the entertainer’s name,  phone number, mailing address, availability, and whether he will  travel to out-of-town locations. The second piece of implicit information  concerns the need to maintain information on the engagements them- selves. An agent must know all the details concerning the engagement  in order to ensure that the engagement runs smoothly.  Now that you know how important it is to look for implicit information,  keep it in mind when you’re defining mission objectives.  Here are the “final words” regarding mission objectives: Make sure that  your mission objectives are both properly defined and well defined,  that each objective makes sense to you and to those for whom you are  designing the database, and that you look for any implicit information  hidden within every participant’s response.  CASE STUDY: DEFINING MISSION  OBJECTIVES FOR MIKE’S BIKES  It’s time now to interview Mike and his staff so that they can help you  define the mission objectives for the Mike’s Bikes database. Here’s a  partial transcript of the interview with Mike. Once again, your assis- tant, Zachary, is conducting the interview.  ZACHARY:  “Can you give me an idea of the things you’d like to track   in the database?” “Oh sure, that’s pretty easy. I want to keep track of our  inventory, our customers, and our sales.”  ZACHARY:  “Is there anything else that you can think of that is   related to these subjects?” “Well, I guess if we’re going to keep track of our inven- tory, we should know who our suppliers are.”  MIKE:   MIKE    112   Chapter 5  Starting the Process  ZACHARY:  “What about the sales reps involved in each sale?” MIKE:   “Oh yeah, we should definitely keep information about  our employees. If nothing else, it’s a good idea to do this  from a human resources point of view. At least, that’s  what my wife tells me!”   The interview continues until Zachary has finished asking all the  questions on his list.   When the interviews are complete, review all the information you’ve  gathered and define the appropriate mission objectives. Be sure to keep  the “final words” in mind as you define them. Here are a few possible  mission objectives for the Mike’s Bikes database.  Maintain complete inventory information.  Maintain complete customer information.  Track all customer sales.  Maintain complete supplier information.  Maintain complete employee information.  Once you’ve compiled a list of mission objectives, review them with  Mike and his staff. When they are satisfied that they understand the  mission objectives and that the list is relatively complete, commit the  list to a document in your favorite application program  and save it for  later use.  Summary  This chapter opened with a discussion of the interview process. You  learned why interviews are an important part of the database design  process and why it’s important to learn how to conduct an interview  properly. You now know the difference between an open-ended question  and a closed question, as well as when to use each kind of question.    Review Questions  113  We ended this discussion by reviewing a set of interview guidelines,  and you learned that you should use them to help you ensure that the  interviews are productive and successful.  The mission statement was our next topic of discussion. We expanded  upon the information in Chapter 4, “Conceptual Overview,” by looking  at how the mission statement states the specific purpose of the data- base. You now know that the process involves conducting interviews  and learning about the organization, then formulating the mission  statement from the information you gathered during these steps.  We defined the characteristics of a good mission statement, and you  learned that a well-defined mission statement establishes a clear focus  for your design efforts.  Next, we discussed mission objectives, and we expanded upon the  Chapter 4 overview once again. As you now know, mission objectives  represent the tasks performed against the data in the database, and  you define them after the mission statement. We then explored how  to define a mission objective. Here, you learned that you conduct  interviews with users and management and that the information you  gather from these interviews provides the basis for each mission objec- tive. We also discussed the characteristics of a well-written mission  objective, and you learned that a clearly defined mission objective will  help you define various structures within the database.

This maxim defines the entire philosophy behind this phase of the  database design process. You must devote some time to gaining a clear  understanding of your organization’s database so that you can  115   116   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database   cid:129  Determine whether the database supports the organization’s cur-  rent information requirements   cid:129  Uncover existing structural deficiencies   cid:129  Determine how the database needs to evolve so that it will sup-  port the organization’s future information requirements  You can use the existing database as a resource for developing a new  database. However, you must carefully judge which aspects of the cur- rent database remain useful and which aspects should be discarded.  You can make these judgments by answering the following questions:  What types of data does the organization use?  How does the organization use that data?  How does the organization manage and maintain that data?  The answers to these questions provide you with vital information that  you can use to design a database that best suits your organization’s  needs.  You can best answer these questions by analyzing your organization’s  existing database. It’s very likely that the organization is using some  type of database, and it can probably be associated with one of the  following categories.   cid:129  Paper-based databases—also known as file systems—typically consist of various forms and handwritten or printed documents stored in file folders or bound in notebooks. The folders and note- books are identified by some coding scheme  e.g., unique num- bers or colored tabs  and stored in file cabinets. These cabinets are likely to be identified by some coding scheme as well, depend- ing on the size of the database.   cid:129  Legacy databases have been in existence and in use for several  years or more and consist of various types of data structures and user interfaces that all reside on mainframe computers, network   Getting to Know the Current Database   117  servers, or personal computers. The capability, functionality, and  effectiveness of the structures and screens are quite dependent  upon the skills and knowledge of the developers, the application  development tools, and the database management software used  to create them.    cid:129  Human-knowledge bases  loosely defined  are based on the mem- ory of one or more employees within an organization. These indi- viduals have a specific amount of knowledge regarding a given aspect of the organization  e.g., customer information or product details , and they are crucial to conducting the organization’s business.  The goals of your analysis are to determine the types of data the orga- nization uses, how the organization manages and maintains that data,  and how the organization views and uses the data. You can reduce the  time it takes to define the preliminary field and table structures for the  new database if you conduct this investigation properly.  During the analysis, you review the various ways the organization  collects and presents its data, and you conduct a set of interviews with  users and management. You then use the information you’ve gath- ered to define a Preliminary Field List and to help you determine the  tables that should be included in the initial database structure. If your  analysis reveals that the current database is poorly designed, you can  take precautions to ensure that you don’t make the same mistakes in  the new database. Despite whatever shortcomings the current data- base may have, it can still help you identify a number of the fields and  tables that you should include in the new database.  There’s one rule you should keep first and foremost in your mind as  you’re analyzing the current database:  Do not adopt the current database structure as the basis for the new  database structure.   118   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Following this rule will help you avert unnecessary errors and aid in  maximizing your design efforts.  Every so often, there’s a point during the analysis when a novice  database developer  and sometimes an experienced one  will stop and  think, “This database doesn’t look too bad. Let’s just end the analy- sis here and use this database as the basis for the new one.” This is a  particularly bad idea because every hidden problem within the current  database structure will be transferred into the new database. These  types of problems include awkward table structures, poorly defined  relationships, and inconsistent field specifications; they will invariably  surface later and at the least opportune times. Therefore, you should  do your best to avoid this perilous situation by following the afore- mentioned rule. Just remember that it’s always better to define a new  database structure explicitly than to copy an existing structure. After  all, if the old database didn’t have problems, you wouldn’t be building a  new one.  You’ll typically analyze paper-based databases and legacy databases  during this part of the design process. Many organizations use both  types of databases to some degree, and you perform the same basic  analysis process on each of them. There are minor differences in the  way you analyze a paper-based database and a legacy database, to be  sure, but the differences have more to do with the databases them- selves than with the overall analysis process. You needn’t be concerned  with these differences, however, because I’ve seamlessly incorporated  them into the analysis process presented in this book.  Paper-Based Databases  A paper-based database incorporates data that is literally collected,  stored, and maintained on paper, and you’ll find these items in a vari- ety of shapes, sizes, and configurations. Some of the more common for- mats include index cards, handwritten or printed reports, and various    Getting to Know the Current Database   119  types of preprinted forms. Anyone who has ever worked in an office for  a business or organization is very familiar with this type of database.  You’ll find that analyzing a paper-based database can be a daunting  task. One of your most immediate problems is finding someone who  completely understands how the database works so that you can learn  its use and purpose. There are several problems with the database  itself, especially in terms of the way data is collected and managed.  This type of database typically contains inconsistent data, erroneous  data, duplicate data, redundant data, incomplete entries, and old data  that should have been purged from the database long ago. Clearly, the  only reason you’d analyze this type of database is to identify items that  you could incorporate into the new database. For example, you can  extract individual pieces of data from various sections of a form in the  old database and transform them into fields in the new database.  Legacy Databases  A legacy database is a database that has been in existence and in use  for five years or more. Mainframe databases typically fall into this cat- egory, as do older PC-based databases. There are several reasons that  “legacy” is used as part of the name for this type of database. First, it  suggests that the database has been around for a long time, possibly  longer than anyone can clearly remember. Second, the word legacy  may mean that the individual who originally created the database  either has shifted responsibilities within the organization or is working  for someone else and, thus, the database has become his or her legacy  to the organization. Third, the term implies the disturbing possibility  that no single individual completely understands the database struc- ture or how it is implemented in the RDBMS application program.  Mainframe legacy databases present some special problems in the  analysis process. One problem stems from the fact that a number  of older mainframe databases are based on hierarchical or network    120   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  database models. If neither you nor anyone in the organization has a  firm understanding of these models, it will take you some time to deci- pher the structure of the database. In this case, you’ll find it very help- ful to make printouts of the data in each of the database structures.  Even if a legacy database is based on the relational model, there’s no  particular guarantee that the structure is sound. Unfortunately, there  are many instances in which the people who created these databases  didn’t completely understand the concept of a relational database.  After  you have read this book, you won’t fall into that group.  The result is  that many older databases have improper or inefficient structures.  Numerous PC-based legacy databases are improperly or inefficiently  designed, too. Many of them were originally developed and imple- mented in older nonrelational database management systems, which  means that they could not take advantage of the benefits provided by  the relational model. Two characteristics commonly associated with  these types of databases are duplicate fields and redundant data.  You’ll learn later that this can cause serious problems with data  integrity.  Analyzing a legacy database is somewhat easier than analyzing a  paper-based database because a legacy database is typically more  organized and structured than a paper-based database, the struc- tures within the database are explicitly defined, and there is usually  an application program that people use to interact with the data in  the database.  The application program is valuable to you during the  analysis process because it can reveal a lot of information about the  data structures and the tasks performed against the data in the legacy  database.  The time it will take you to perform a proper analysis will  depend to some degree on the platform  mainframe or PC , the RDBMS  used to implement the legacy database, and the application program.  The key point to remember when you’re analyzing either a paper-based  or a legacy database is that you should proceed through the process    Looking at How Data Is Collected   121  patiently and methodically so that you can ensure a thorough and  accurate analysis.  Conducting the Analysis  There are three steps in the analysis process: reviewing the way data  is collected, reviewing the manner in which information is presented,  and conducting interviews with users and management.  It will be necessary for you to speak to various people in the organi- zation as you conduct the first two steps in this process. Be sure your  conversations relate purely to the reviews at hand. You’ll have the oppor- tunity to ask them other in-depth questions later. Keep in mind that  these reviews are an integral part of your preparation for the inter- views that will follow. Indeed, these reviews help you determine the  types of questions you’ll need to ask in subsequent interviews.  Looking at How Data Is Collected  The first step in the analysis process involves reviewing the ways in  which data is collected. This includes everything from index cards  and handwritten or printed lists to preprinted forms and data entry  screens  such as those used in a database program or web browser .  Begin this step by reviewing all paper-based items. Find out what  types of documents the organization is using to record data and then  gather a single sample of each. Assemble these samples and store them  in a folder for use later in the design process. For example, assume  that the organization is collecting supplier data on index cards. Go  through each of the index cards until you find one with an entry that  is as complete as possible. When you’ve found an appropriate sample,  make a copy of it and save it in the folder. Proceed through this pro- cess for each type of item being used. Figure 6.1 shows two examples  of how the organization might use paper-based items to collect data.   122   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  A1 Office Supplies  Suite 133 7739 Alpine Way SE Seattle, WA  98115  Susan Black Email  519-5883 susanb@A10S.com  Employee Fact Sheet  Date Hired: June 30, 2009  7527 Taxco Drive  City: Seattle  State: WA  Zip: 98115  Date of Birth: 09 22 85  SSN: 987-65-0049  Name: George Chavez Address:  Phone: 553-0399  Education: Name of Academic Organization University of Texas at El Paso  Location El Paso, TX  Year Graduated  2007  Figure 6.1  Examples of paper-based items used to collect data  Next, review all of the computer programs that the organization uses  to collect data. The objective here is to gather a set of sample screen- shots that represent how the organization uses these programs to work  with data. A word of caution: Many people have discovered unique and  ingenious ways to use common programs, such as word processors  and spreadsheets, as a way to collect and manage data. Make sure you  speak with someone who is familiar with the way the computers are  being used within the organization and determine which programs the  organization is using to manage its data.  As you review each program, find a screen that best represents how  the program collects data. You’re looking for screens similar to those in  Figure 6.2.   Looking at How Data Is Collected   123  Figure 6.2  A typical database screen and a typical spreadsheet screen  The first screen is typical of those you would find in a database pro- gram, and the second screen is typical of those you would find in a  spreadsheet program. When you’ve found an appropriate sample, cre- ate a screenshot using your favorite screen-capture application, paste  it into a document in your word processing program, indicate the name  of the source program and the date you created the screenshot, and  then print the document. Continue reviewing the program and repeat  this procedure as appropriate. Then repeat the entire process for each  program. Once you’ve printed copies of all the appropriate screenshots,  assemble them together and store them in a folder for use later in the  design process.   124   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Now examine the web pages that the organization uses to collect data  via the Internet. The pages you’re interested in will look very similar to  the data entry forms you would find in a database application pro- gram. Figure 6.3 shows an example of such a page.  Figure 6.3  An example of a typical web-based data entry screen  You can follow the same examination procedure here that you used  with the application programs. Take a screenshot of a given web page,  paste it into a word processing document, indicate the program name  and screen capture date, and print it. Continue to review the web  pages and repeat this procedure as appropriate. Once you’ve printed  copies of all the appropriate screenshots, assemble them and store  them in a folder for use later in the design process.  Make sure you clearly mark the folders containing the samples you’ve  gathered during your analysis. The small amounts of time you invest  to organize your materials pay big dividends when you use those mate- rials during a complex phase of the design process.   Looking at How Information Is Presented   125  Looking at How Information Is  Presented  The second step in the analysis process involves reviewing the vari- ous ways in which the organization presents its data as information.  During this process, you’ll review items, such as handwritten docu- ments, computer printouts, screen presentations, and web pages.  Here are three of the most popular presentation methods that you’ll  encounter during this process.  1. Reports: A report is any document  handwritten, typed, or  computer-generated  used to arrange and present data in such a way that it is meaningful to the person or people viewing it. Although using a word processor, spreadsheet, or other software program is the standard method of generating a report, you’ll still find some reports written by hand.  2. Screen presentations  a.k.a. slide shows : This type of presen-  tation incorporates a series of screens that discuss various topics in an organized manner. It is generally created with a program, such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Corel Presentations, and executed on a computer, although it can also be composed of a series of plastic sheets that are displayed on a screen by an overhead projector.  For our purposes, we’ll assume that you’re reviewing a computer-based screen presentation.   3. Web pages: Many organizations have vast amounts of informa- tion available via pages on their web sites. A web page is used in much the same manner as a report, and, indeed, it is really nothing more than a different type of report.  Begin this step by identifying and reviewing each report the organi- zation generates from the database, regardless of whether the organi- zation produces the report by hand or with an application program.    126   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Gather samples of the reports and assemble them in a folder as you  did with the items in the previous step. Overall, this task is easier to  perform in this step than it was in the previous step because people in  the organization are typically familiar with the reports they use. Copies  of the reports are usually readily available, and most reports can be  reprinted if necessary. Figure 6.4 shows an example of a report written  by hand and a report generated from a word processing program.

It’s unnecessary for you to review every presentation, but  you do need to review those that have a direct bearing on the data in  the database. For example, you don’t need to review a presentation on    Looking at How Information Is Presented   127  the organization’s new product if it doesn’t draw any data from the data- base. On the other hand, a presentation on sales statistics that does  incorporate data from the database is one that you do need to review.  Once you’ve identified which presentations you need to review, go  through each one carefully and make screenshots of the slides that  use or incorporate data from the database. Copy the screenshots into  a word processing document, print the document, and then store the  document in a folder for later use.  Write the name of the presentation  and the date you captured the screenshots on the folder; you may need  to refer to it again at a later time.  Follow this procedure separately for  each presentation. You want to make sure you don’t accidentally com- bine two or more presentations together, because this mistake will  inevitably lead to mass confusion and result in one huge mess!  Figure 6.5 shows an example of the type of slides you’ll examine  during this review.

Therefore, work closely with the person most    128   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  familiar with the presentation to ensure that you include all appropri- ate slides in the samples.  Finally, review web pages that draw information directly from the data- base. Perform this review in the same manner as the review for the  screen presentations. As with the previous review, you need to review  those web pages that have a direct bearing on the data in the data- base. For example, you don’t need to review a web page that provides a  history of your organization, but you do need to review a web page that  displays regional employee information.  Once you’ve identified which web pages you need to review, take a  screenshot of each page. Copy the screenshots into a word process- ing document, print the document, and then store the document in a  folder for later use.  Write the URL address and the current date under  each screenshot in the document; you may need to refer to a particular  web page again at a later time.   Figure 6.6 shows an example of a web page you would examine during  this review.  Figure 6.6  Example of a web page that presents information from a database   Conducting Interviews  129  Try to work with the person  or persons  who created and developed  the organization’s web site. She can save you a lot of time by directing  you to the exact pages you should examine for this review.  Conducting Interviews  Now that you have a general idea of how the organization collects  and presents its data, it’s time to interview users and management to  determine how the organization uses its data. Interviews are useful in  the analysis phase for these reasons   cid:129  They provide details about the samples you assembled during the previous reviews. The discussions you had with users and man- agement during the previous reviews were solely meant to iden- tify  in general terms  how the organization collects and presents the data it uses. In this phase, however, you’ll ask specific ques- tions about the samples you assembled during those reviews. This will enable you to clarify the aspects of a specific sample that you consider to be vague or ambiguous.   cid:129  They provide information on the way the organization uses its  data. These interviews will provide you with information on how users work with the organization’s data on a daily basis and how management uses information based on that data to manage the organization’s affairs.   cid:129  They are instrumental in defining preliminary field and table struc-  tures. The responses you receive from users and management during this round of interviews will help you identify initial field and table structures for the database.   cid:129  They help to define future information requirements. The discus-  sions you’ll have with users and management regarding the organization’s future growth will often reveal new information requirements that must be supported by the database.   130   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  I cannot overemphasize, and you must not underestimate, the impact  interviews have on the final database structure and how important  they are to your successful completion of the database design process.  Only full and complete interviews will help you ensure that the data- base you design fulfills your organization’s information requirements.  Basic Interview Techniques  In order for you to conduct successful interviews, you must first learn  a few basic interview techniques. I address this issue here by providing  you with a set of fundamental techniques that you can use to conduct  every interview within the database design process. These techniques  are relatively easy to learn and apply and they’ll enable you to obtain  the information you require for the task at hand.  You’ll probably execute these techniques in a strict, mechanical fash- ion as you’re just starting to learn them, but you’ll apply them more  instinctively and intuitively as you conduct further interviews and  gain additional experience. Conducting an interview is a skill, and, as  with any other skill, you will achieve various degrees of expertise with  patience and practice.  The Importance of Questions  Learning how to ask a question is a valuable skill that you’ll have to  learn and develop if you’re going to be successful at designing data- bases. It is what you will use to understand how your  or your client’s   business works and enable you to gather the information you need to  develop the various structures for the database. And, as you may have  already surmised, it is precisely the skill required to conduct the inter- views throughout this design process. I know this might seem like I’m  stating the obvious, but I just can’t overstate how important a skill this  truly is.   Conducting Interviews  131  The Interview Process  You use both open-ended and closed questions throughout an inter- view, alternating between each type as the interview progresses. Open- ended questions are more general in nature and enable you to focus on  specific subjects, whereas closed questions are more specific and allow  you to focus on particular details of a certain subject. For instance,  start the interview with a few open-ended questions to establish some  general subjects for discussion and then select a subject and ask more  specific  closed  questions relating to that subject. You could begin by  asking one of the interview participants an open-ended question such  as this:  “How would you define the work that you do on a daily basis?”  Most participants will use three or more sentences to answer this type  of question. It’s perfectly acceptable for a participant to provide you  with a long, descriptive response because you can work with this type  of response more easily than you can with one that is terse. To illus- trate this point, assume the participant responds to your question in  this manner:  “As an account representative, I’m responsible for ten clients. Each of  my clients makes an appointment to come into the showroom to view  the merchandise we have to offer for the current season. Part of my  job is to answer any questions they have about our merchandise and  make recommendations regarding the most popular items. Once they  make a decision on the merchandise they’d like to purchase, I write  up a sales order for the client. Then I give the sales order to my assis- tant, who promptly fills the order and sends it to the client.”  This is a very good response. The participant not only answered your  question, but also provided you with the opportunity to begin asking  follow-up questions. His response also suggests several subjects that  you can discuss later in the interview.   132   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  ❖ Note  A terse response, such as “I fill out customer sales orders,” will provide you with little information, so you’ll have to work a bit harder with the participant to get an idea of what this process involves. Terse responses commonly indicate that the participant is just nervous or uncomfortable. In this case, you could put him at ease by discussing an unrelated topic for a few moments or by allowing him to select a more familiar or comfort- able subject as a starting point.  Identifying Subjects  As you ask each open-ended question, identify the subjects suggested  within the response to the question. You can identify subjects by  looking for nouns within the sentences that make up the response.  Subjects are always represented by nouns and identify a person, place,  thing, or event  something that occurs at a given point in time . There  are some nouns, however, that represent a characteristic of a person,  place, thing, or event; you don’t need to concern yourself with these  just yet. Therefore, make sure you only look for nouns that specifically  represent a person, place, thing, or event.  Note that there’s no need  to mark more than one occurrence of a given noun.  You can ensure  that you account for every subject you need to discuss by marking  the nouns with a double-underline as you identify them, as in this  example:  “As an account representative, I’m responsible for ten clients. Each of  my clients makes an appointment to come into the showroom to view  the merchandise we have to offer for the current season. Part of my  job is to answer any questions they have about our merchandise and  make recommendations regarding the most popular items. Once they  make a decision on the merchandise they’d like to purchase, I write  up a sales order for the client. Then I give the sales order to my assis- tant, who promptly fills the order and sends it to the client.”   Conducting Interviews  133  After you’ve identified all of the appropriate nouns within the response,  list them on a sheet of paper; this becomes your list of subjects. You’ll  add more subjects to the list as you continue to work through the  design process. Compile this list carefully and methodically because  you’ll use it to generate further discussions as the interview progresses  and to help you define tables later in the design process.  Here are subjects  shown in alphabetical order  that are represented in  the previous response:  Account Representative   Job  Appointment  Assistant  Clients  Items  Merchandise  Sales Order  Season  Showroom  You can now use this list as the basis of further questions during the  interview.  ❖ Note  I refer to this entire procedure as the Subject-Identifica- tion Technique throughout the remainder of the book.  Verify that the nouns you’ve underlined are genuine subjects by  reviewing the way they’re used in the response. For example, “account  representative” is a subject suggested by a noun in the first sentence,  and you can assume that the subject identifies an object  person, place,  or thing  by the way the noun is used in the sentence. “Appointment” is  another subject suggested by a noun in the second sentence, and you  can assume this subject represents an event  something that occurs at  a given point in time  by the way it is used in the sentence.   134   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Identifying Characteristics  After you’ve identified the subjects suggested within the response, pick  a particular subject and begin to ask follow-up questions related to that  subject. You use this line of questioning to obtain as much detailed  information as possible about the subject you’ve selected. Make sure  your follow-up questions are more specific as you progress through  this part of the discussion. The nature of your follow-up questions will  depend on the responses you receive from the participant. Based on  our sample response, for example, you could continue the discussion by  asking more specific questions about sales orders or you could begin an  entirely new line of questioning regarding clients. Assume, for now, that  you ask the following question to learn more about sales orders:  “Let’s discuss sales orders for a moment. What does it take to complete  a sales order for a client?”  Note that this question begins with a statement directing the inter- view participant to focus on a particular subject. This is a technique  you should use to guide your conversation after you’ve selected a  specific subject to discuss. Also note that the question is open-ended;  it prompts the participant for details related to the subject you’ve  selected  sales orders  and allows you to establish the focus of the par- ticipant’s subsequent responses.  Now, assume that the participant gives the following reply:  “Well, I enter all the client information first, such as the client’s name,  address, phone number, and email address. Then I enter the items  the client wants to purchase. After I’ve entered all the items, I tally up  the totals and I’m done. Oh, I forgot to mention: I enter the client’s fax  number and shipping address—if they have one.”  Analyze this response with the Subject-Identification Technique to  determine whether there are subjects suggested within the response.  Then add the new subjects to your list of subjects. Remember: List only  those nouns that represent person, place, thing, or event.   Conducting Interviews  135  After you’ve finished identifying new subjects, begin looking for details  regarding the subject under discussion. Your objective here is to obtain  as many facts about the subject as possible. Now you’re interested in  nouns that represent characteristics of a subject—they describe partic- ular aspects of that subject. You can identify these nouns quite easily  because they are usually in singular form  “phone number,” “address” .  In contrast, nouns that identify subjects are usually in possessive form   “the client’s phone number,” “the company’s address” .  Try to account for as many characteristics of the subject as possible.  Use a single underline to mark a noun that represents a characteristic,  as in this example:  “Well, I enter all the client information first, such as the client’s name,  address, phone number, and email address. Then I enter the items the  client wants to purchase. After I’ve entered all the items, I tally up the  totals and I’m done. Oh, I forgot to mention that I enter the client’s fax  number and shipping address—if they have one.”  As you identify the appropriate nouns within a response, list them on a  sheet of paper; this becomes your list of characteristics. You’ll add more  characteristics to the list as you work through the design process,  and you’ll use this list later when you’re determining the fields for the  database. Use a separate sheet of paper for the list of characteristics. Do  not list the subjects and characteristics on the same sheet!  The reason  for keeping them on different lists will become clear when you begin  to define tables for the database in Chapter 7, “Establishing Table  Structures.”   Here are the characteristics  shown in alphabetical order  that are rep- resented in the previous response:  Address   Name  Totals  Email Address  Phone Number   Fax Number   Shipping Address    136   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  This constitutes the list of characteristics for the subject under dis- cussion. These characteristics will eventually become fields in the  database.  ❖ Note  I refer to this entire procedure as the Characteristic-Iden- tification Technique throughout the remainder of the book.  Verify that the nouns you’ve marked with a single underline are genu- ine characteristics by reviewing the way they’re used in the response.  For example, “name” is a characteristic suggested by a noun in the  first sentence, and you can assume that it describes some aspect of the  subject “client” by the way the noun is used in the sentence. “Shipping  address” is another characteristic suggested by a noun in the last sen- tence, and you can assume that this noun also represents some aspect  of the subject “client” by the way the noun is used in the sentence.  After you’ve finished discussing a particular subject, move on to the  next subject on your subjects list and begin the same pattern of ques- tioning. Start with open-ended questions, identify the subjects sug- gested in the responses, ask more specific questions as the discussion  progresses, and identify as many of the subject’s characteristics as  possible. Continue this process in a methodical manner until you’ve  discussed every subject on your list.  You should learn the Subject-Identification Technique and the Char- acteristic-Identification Technique as thoroughly as possible because  you’ll use them during your interviews with users and management  and as you identify fields and tables for the initial database struc- ture. Note that you won’t have to incorporate the single and double  underlines forever; you’ll eventually execute these techniques in your  mind as you gain experience and as they become more instinctive and  intuitive.   Interviewing Users  137  Before You Begin the Interview Process . . .  You can use the techniques you’ve just learned in this section for both  user interviews and management interviews. The only differences  between the two sets of interviews lie in the subject matter and the  content of the questions.  The interview process involves two sets of discussions: one with users  and the other with management. You’ll speak to the users first because  they represent the “front lines” of the organization. They have the  clearest picture of the details connected with the organization’s daily  operations. Also, the information you gather from the users should  help you to understand the answers you receive from management.  Interviewing Users  The first part of the interview process involves conducting user inter- views. The interviews focus on these four issues:  1. The types of data users are currently using  2. How users are currently using their data  3. The collection of samples you assembled during the first two  steps of the analysis  4. And the types of information users require for their daily work  Because these issues are both data-centric and information-centric,  you must be certain that you understand and always keep in mind  the difference between data and information. Recall from Chapter 3,  “Terminology,” that data are the values you store in the database and  information is data that you process in a manner that makes it mean- ingful and useful to you when you work with it or view it. Keeping  these definitions in mind will help ensure that you focus on each issue  properly and conduct each segment of the interview successfully.   138   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Reviewing Data Type and Usage  You can usually discuss the first two issues at the same time if you  carefully phrase your questions at the beginning of the interview. Your  objective for this part of the interview is to identify the types of data  the users are currently using and how they use that data in support of  the work they do. You’ll use this information later in the design process  to help define field and table structures. Use the data collection and  data representation samples to help you formulate questions about the  user’s data.  However, don’t actually discuss the samples just yet; you  should deal with them separately.  During this discussion, you’ll start  with open-ended questions, identify subjects within the responses, and  then use specific follow-up questions to identify the characteristics of  each subject.  As you begin the interview, ask each participant about the work he or  she performs on a daily basis. After a participant provides an overall  description of the work he does, ask him to explain his job in more  detail. Perhaps he can walk you through the job he performs on a daily  basis.  Here’s an example of a typical conversation that occurs during this  part of the interview:  INTERVIEWER:  PARTICIPANT:   INTERVIEWER:   PARTICIPANT:   “What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis?” “I accept land-use applications that are submitted  by various people, log them in, and set a hearing  date with the hearing examiner. I also assist appli- cants if they have any questions regarding a specific  application.” “Let’s talk about the applications for a moment. What  types of facts are associated with an application?” “There’s quite a number, actually. There are facts  concerning the type and name of the application, its  designation and address, and its location.”   Interviewing Users  139  INTERVIEWER:   PARTICIPANT:   “Tell me about the facts concerning the application’s  type and name.” “There are four things we record: the type of applica- tion, the name of the subdivision, the purpose of the  project, and a description of the project.”  Note how the interviewer starts the discussion with an open-ended  question. After the participant responds, the interviewer uses the   Subject-Identification Technique to identify subjects within the response.  The interviewer then chooses a particular subject and uses another  open-ended question to focus the participant’s attention on that subject.  Because the participant’s next response is general in nature, the inter- viewer focuses on a particular aspect of the subject and uses a more spe- cific follow-up question to elicit a detailed response from the participant.  The interviewer can continue to narrow the focus of his questions as  the discussion progresses. As the participant responds to each ques- tion, the interviewer continues to use the Characteristic-Identification  Technique to identify characteristics of the subject that appear in the  response. After he’s identified all of the subject’s characteristics, the  interviewer then moves on to the next subject and begins the entire  process again. He’ll continue in this manner until he’s covered his  entire list of subjects. You’ll go through the same exact process when  you act as interviewer.  ❖ Note  The dialogue in the previous example and in the exam- ples throughout the book is simplistic by design; this also applies to all of the sample questions I provide during my dis- cussion of the interview process. They are simply the vehicle through which I am presenting a specific skill or technique. As such, don’t get too preoccupied with the actual dialogue or question itself; rather, focus on how it is illustrating the skill or technique that I’m discussing at the moment. The examples will be more beneficial to you if you see them from this perspective.   140   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Reviewing the Samples  The next round of discussions centers on all the samples you assem- bled earlier in the analysis process. Your objectives during these  discussions are to identify how the objects represented by the samples  are used, clarify the aspects of the samples you don’t understand, and  assign a description to each sample.  It should be relatively easy for you to talk to participants about the  samples now that you have an idea of the data the participants use on  a daily basis. Begin the conversation by asking questions about a spe- cific sample. Figure 6.7 shows an example of a data collection sample  you might use as a starting point.  Figure 6.7  A data collection sample  ❖ Note  The statement I made about the dialogue examples also applies to this figure and many of the other figures throughout the book. These figures are simply the vehicle through which I am presenting a specific skill or technique. Use the same approach that I suggested for the dialogue examples, as they’ll be more beneficial to you.  Review your notes from the discussions you held at the beginning of  the interview before you ask your first question. You want to determine    Interviewing Users  141  whether anything you’ve already discussed is relevant to the sample  you’re about to discuss. In one of the previous discussions, for exam- ple, a participant indicated that part of his job is to keep track of all  the organization’s customers. Using that statement as a starting point,  you could ask him how he uses this particular data collection sample  to perform that task.  “You mentioned in a previous discussion that you keep track of all the  customers. How does this screen help you to carry out that task?”  This is a well-phrased question. It begins with a statement that focuses  on a particular subject and then continues by bringing the partici- pant’s attention to the sample. The question is open enough to elicit a  clear and complete response.  Now, assume the participant provides this response:  “This screen allows me to enter new customers, as well as modify and  maintain all the information we have on existing customers.”  If this reply answers the question to your complete satisfaction, use  it as the basis for a description of the sample. On the other hand, if  the reply does not completely answer the question, continue with an  appropriate line of questioning until the participant clearly identifies  the purpose and use of the sample. You must supply descriptions for  all of your samples because you’ll use them again later in the design  process.  A sample’s description should be succinct, yet clear enough to indicate  the sample’s purpose and how it is used. Write the description on a slip  of paper and attach it to the sample. Here’s an example of a description  you might use for the sample in Figure 6.7:  This screen is used to collect and maintain all customer data.  It’s necessary for you to understand the sample as completely as  possible so that you can write a clear and concise description. If there  are aspects of a given sample that you don’t understand, ask the    142   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Current Product Inventory  Product ID  Product Description  Category  SRP  Quantity  9001  9002  9003  9004  Shur-Lok U-Lock  Accessories  SpeedRite Cyclecomputer  SteelHead Microshell Helmet  Accessories  SureStop 133-MB Brakes  Components  75.00  65.00  36.00  23.50  20  33  16  Figure 6.8  A report sample  participant to clarify them for you. For example, assume you’re work- ing with the report sample shown in Figure 6.8.  If you don’t know what the abbreviation “SRP” represents, make sure  you have the participant clarify it for you—never make assumptions or  suppositions. Doing so can waste valuable time and effort later in the  process if your assumption or supposition proves to be incorrect.  As you compose descriptions for each of the samples, you might find it  difficult to write a description for a complex sample. A sample is com- plex if it represents more than one subject. The sample in Figure 6.8,  for example, covers only one subject: products. The sample in Fig- ure 6.9, however, covers at least three subjects: doctor services, nurs- ing services, and patients. You’ll often have to work a little harder to  determine a complex sample’s purpose and use. In some cases, you’ll  have to use the Subject-Identification Technique to determine what  subjects are represented.  Let’s say you’re working with the report sample shown in Figure 6.9  and you have questions regarding the nursing services. You wonder  whether the organization is using this report as an indirect means of    Interviewing Users  143  Eastside Medical Clinic  7743 Kingman Dr. Seattle, WA 98032  206  555-9982  Patient Name: Patient ID:  Visit Date: Physician:  George Edelman 10884  02 16  12 Daniel Chavez  Doctors Services  Service Code  Fee  Nursing Services  Service Code  Fee  X X  Consultation EKG Physical Ultrasound  92883 92773 98377 97399  119.00 95.00  R.N.

A question that elicits a  yes or no response from a participant is not going to help you much at  all, so you need to use an open-ended question that will elicit a more  informative response. You could begin your discussion of this sample  with this question:  “What nursing services do you provide besides those listed in this  sample?”  This type of question gives the participant an opportunity to provide  you with a detailed response; furthermore, you’ve given yourself the  opportunity to ask follow-up questions as warranted by the partici- pant’s reply. To continue the example, say you receive the following  answer:  “We provide various specialized services for the more complex patient.  You see only the general services on this report. However, I can show  you a complete list of our services that Katherine maintains on her  computer.”   144   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  You can continue with the process of writing the sample’s description  if this reply clarifies the point in question and you now understand the  purpose of this report sample; otherwise, continue asking follow-up  questions until everything is explained to your satisfaction.  Reviewing Information Requirements  The final issue you’ll discuss with users concerns their informa- tion requirements. The objectives of this discussion are to determine  whether individual users receive information based on data they don’t  directly control or maintain, to determine what types of additional  information they need, and to determine what types of information  they can foresee themselves needing in the future. You’ll use the infor- mation you gather during this discussion later in the design process to  help define and verify field and table structures. You can also use this  information as yet another way of determining whether you acciden- tally overlooked anything during the previous discussions.  Current Information Requirements  Users typically receive the information they use through a variety of  reports. Therefore, the best way to begin this discussion is by review- ing the report samples. This time around, though, you’re not so con- cerned with how the reports are used as you are with the data upon  which they are based. It’s quite common that information on some of  the reports a user receives is based on data he does not personally cre- ate and maintain. In this situation, you must determine the origin of  that data so that you can identify all the data used by a user, whether  he uses it directly or indirectly.  Select a report from the report samples and work with one of the par- ticipants to determine what data is used to produce the report. Ask  him if he creates and maintains the data on which the report is based.  You can move on to the next sample if he answers yes, but you’ll need    Interviewing Users  145  to identify the origin of the data if he answers no. Here’s an example  that illustrates this process.  Say you have an assistant named Kira who is beginning a discussion  with a participant named Joan regarding the report sample shown in  Figure 6.10.  Customer Phone List  Customer Name  Customer Type  Last Purchase  Phone Number  Alastair Black Dave Cunningham Zachary Ehrlich Bill Champlin  Preferred Silver Preferred Gold  11 21 11 12 19 11 11 16 11 01 22 12  551-0993 533-9182 515-3921 552-3884  Figure 6.10  A sample report  As Kira begins the conversation, Joan mentions that she works in the  telemarketing department. When Kira first asks about the sample  report, Joan indicates that she receives it every Monday morning. So  Kira asks her the following question:  “Do you provide the data that’s used to generate this report?”  Her next course of action depends on Joan’s response. Kira can move  on to the next sample if Joan’s answer is yes; however, it would be a  good idea for Kira to ask a follow-up question to make certain that  Joan’s answer is true.  “Do you personally enter and maintain this data on a daily basis?”  If Joan’s answer is still yes, Kira can definitely move on to the next  sample.   146   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  On the other hand, if Joan’s answer to the original question is no,  Kira will need to ask a few follow-up questions. First, she’ll ask Joan  whether she contributes any data to the report. If she does, Kira will  then determine what data Joan specifically submits. Then Kira will  ask whether Joan knows the source of the remaining data.  To continue the example, say Joan’s reply to the original question is no  and that the following dialogue takes place after her response:  KIRA:   JOAN:  KIRA:   JOAN:  KIRA:  JOAN:  KIRA:  JOAN:   KIRA:   “Can you tell me, then, if there is any data that you con- tribute to the report at all?” “I do supply the customer’s name and phone number.” “Then you don’t supply the customer type or the last  purchase date. Is that correct?” “Yes.” “Can you tell me who provides this data?” “I’m not really sure, but . . .” “Do you have an idea of where these items come from?” “As a matter of fact, I do. They come from the sales  department.” “That sounds good to me. I’ll make a note of that on this  sample, and then we can move on to the next one.”  Note that as the dialog begins, Kira first tries to determine whether  Joan submits any data at all to the report. When Joan reveals that she  contributes two of the items for the report, Kira then poses a follow-up  question to verify that Joan is not submitting any of the other data.  Finally, Kira tries to identify the source of the remaining data by ask- ing Joan if she knows from where the data originates. In this case, it  takes only two well-phrased questions to find the answer. If Joan could  not answer the last two questions, Kira would need to continue her  investigation with other participants.  You’re sure to obtain all the information you need about your report  samples if your discussions progress in the same manner as the    Interviewing Users  147  preceding dialogue. Remember: Follow-up questions are a crucial part  of the conversation. You must phrase your questions properly to elicit  the types of responses you need from the participants.  Additional Information Requirements  The next subject of discussion is additional information requirements.  The objective here is to determine whether users require additional  information that is not being delivered to them currently. If this is the  case, you must identify what additional information they require and  then define new data structures to support this extra information later  in the design process.  Start this conversation by directing the participants to review the  reports they currently receive. Ask them whether there is other infor- mation they would like to see in their reports. Next, direct them to  discuss the additional information, which reports the information will  affect, and the reason they believe the information is necessary. Then  determine whether the additional information represents new subjects  or new characteristics. If it does, identify each new item and add it to  the appropriate list. Finally, review the participants’ comments and  determine whether there are further issues you need to discuss with  them in regard to the reports. Here’s an example that illustrates the  process.  Say you’re beginning this discussion and you’ve just asked the par- ticipants to review the report samples they currently use. One of the  participants is reviewing the sample report shown in Figure 6.11.  You now instruct this particular participant to note the additional  information she would like to see on the report and to provide a brief  statement indicating why the information is necessary. It doesn’t  really matter exactly how she makes the notations so long as they are  clear and attached to the report in an obvious manner. In this case,  she decides to use large sticky notes as a means of documenting her    148   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Current Product Inventory  Product ID  Product Description  Category  SRP  Quantity  9001 9002 9003 9004  Shur-Lok U-Lock SpeedRite Cyclecomputer SteelHead Microshell Helmet SureStop 133-MB Brakes  Accessories  Accessories Components  75.00 65.00 36.00 23.50  20 33 16  Figure 6.11  The sample report being reviewed by a participant  comments.

She’s also suggested possible  locations for the fields by writing their names on the report itself. Fig- ure 6.12 shows the sample report with her comments.

Apply the Subject- Identification  Technique and the Characteristic-Identification Technique to the com- ments attached to the report. Here’s an example of how you apply these  techniques to the first comment in Figure 6.12:   Interviewing Users  149  “Can we include the vendor name? It would make it easier to identify a  specific product.”  Here you’ve identified both a subject and a characteristic.  Note that  the subject and characteristic aren’t directly related: “vendor name” is  a characteristic of a vendor, not of a product. There’s no problem here,  but you should be aware that this apparent mismatch of subjects and  characteristics is typical. You’ll address this issue later in the design  process.  Now, check your subjects list and characteristics list to deter- mine whether you’ve already accounted for these items. If you have,  move on to the next comment and repeat this procedure.  If you do discover a new subject, add it to your list of subjects and  then identify as many of its characteristics as possible. When you’re  finished, add these items to your list of characteristics, move on to the  next comment, and repeat the entire procedure. In many instances,  however, you’ll only identify new characteristics. Don’t be alarmed.  People often want to add items to a report that are characteristics of  subjects that are already represented by the information on the report.  Finally, reexamine each report and determine if you have questions  or concerns about the notes participants have made. For instance,  you may question the rationale behind one participant’s belief that  specific fields are necessary on a given report. Or you might wonder  why another participant wants to exclude certain fields from one of  his reports. You definitely want to make sure that the fields he wants  to exclude are truly unnecessary and that removing them will not  have an adverse effect on the information the report provides to other  people. In either case, the inclusion or exclusion of fields will affect the  final database structure.  If a report has one or more remarks that are cause for concern, review  it with the appropriate participant and settle as many of the issues as  you can. You can usually resolve all your concerns with a few simple  questions, but in some cases the resolution to certain issues will not    150   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  become apparent until later in the design process. For example, you  might have noticed that certain fields appear on two or more reports.  It’s difficult to determine if the fields are being unnecessarily dupli- cated until you begin to define the field and table structures. When  you encounter an issue that is difficult to resolve at the present time,  make a note of it and put the report aside for later review.  Future Information Requirements  The last subject of discussion concerns future information require- ments. Your objective here is to identify the information that the  participants believe will be necessary for them to receive as the orga- nization evolves. Once you identify these future information require- ments, you can ensure that you define the data structures necessary  to support that information.  You first need to make sure that every participant has some idea of  how the organization is evolving. The nature of the organization’s evo- lution will determine what new information participants will require.  If several people are unacquainted with these issues, you’ll need to  obtain this information from management and then relay it to the par- ticipants prior to the discussion. Once everyone is familiar with these  matters, you can begin the conversation.  Start the discussion by directing the participants to think about the  future evolution of the organization and how it may affect the work  they do on a daily basis. You’ll often find that some participants are  going to have a difficult time envisioning this scenario. When this hap- pens, use questions such as these to help them focus their thoughts:  How will the organization’s evolution affect the amount of information  you’ll need to do your job?  Do you think you’ll need additional types of information to carry out  your duties effectively as the organization evolves?   Interviewing Users  151  How will the evolution of the organization increase the time you spend  on your daily tasks?  Can you predict what types  categories, not specific items  of new  information you’ll need in order to carry out your duties as the organi- zation evolves?  Do you anticipate a need for new information if your duties are  increased as a result of the organization’s evolution?  Keep in mind that most of the participants’ answers will be based on  speculation. There’s no accurate way for them to predict what types  of information they’ll really need until the organization’s evolution  occurs. However, if you can anticipate their hypothetical information  requirements, you can prepare for them by defining the necessary data  structures in advance.  As the participants respond, use the Subject-Identification Technique  to identify brand-new subjects and then add them to your list of sub- jects. Then use the Characteristic-Identification Technique to uncover  new details concerning existing or new subjects and add them to your  list of characteristics.  You can sketch ideas for new reports or data entry forms to help  participants visualize the types of information they may need in the  future. These sketches can then help you identify new subjects or  characteristics that the database structure needs to address. If you  create several rough drawings of sample reports, be sure to assemble  them in a separate, clearly marked folder. Then code each revision so  that you can compare it with earlier revisions. Figure 6.13 shows an  example of a preliminary design for a future report.  Continue the conversation with users until you’re satisfied that you’ve  accounted for as many of the participants’ future information require- ments as possible. When you’ve completed the discussion, you’re ready  to conduct interviews with management.   152   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  1st Quarter Customer Sales Statistics  Customer ID  Customer Name  Maximum  Minimum  Average  Sales Amounts  9001  9002  9003  9004  Stewart Jameson  265.00  23.00  55.00  Shannon Black  Estela Rosales  Timothy Ennis  550.00  125.00  70.00  250.00  35.00  36.00  325.00  20.00  25.00  Figure 6.13  An example of a design for a new report  ❖ Note  You can use all of the techniques you learned in this section for the management interviews as well. Therefore, the next section is somewhat shorter and more concise.  Interviewing Management  The second part of the interview process involves interviewing man- agement personnel. This round of interviews focuses on these issues:  1. The types of information managers currently receive  2. The types of additional information they need to receive  3. The types of information they foresee themselves needing  4. And their perception of the organization’s overall information  requirements   Interviewing Management  153  ❖ Note  Throughout the remainder of the book, I use the term management to refer to the person or persons controlling or directing the organization.  Reviewing Current Information Requirements  Your objectives during the first part of this interview are to identify  the information that management routinely receives and to determine  whether it receives reports that are not represented in your group of  report samples.  As you begin the interview, ask each participant about the work he  performs and the responsibilities associated with his position. A man- ager typically has a number of issues on his mind, so these questions  will help him focus his attention on the matters at hand. His answers  will give you some idea of how he might use the information on the  reports he receives and will provide you with a perspective on his need  for that information.  Next, ask each participant if he uses any of the reports in your collec- tion of report samples. Proceed with the next step if he says he doesn’t  use any of the reports; otherwise, examine each report and ask him to  help you identify other subjects that you might have previously over- looked. Use the Subject-Identification Technique as necessary to aid  you in this process. If the manager identifies a new subject, add it to  your list of subjects and use the Characteristic-Identification Tech- nique to determine the subject’s characteristics. Then add the new  characteristics to your list of characteristics. Repeat this entire proce- dure for each sample report.  Continue the discussion by asking each participant whether he  receives reports that are not represented in your report samples. If he  answers yes, obtain a sample of each new report and review it with the    154   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  participant. Use the Subject-Identification Technique and the Character- istic-Identification Technique to identify the subjects  and their associ- ated characteristics  represented within the report, and then add the  subjects and characteristics to their respective lists. Finally, attach a  description to the report and add it to your collection of report samples.  Repeat this procedure until you’ve accounted for every new report.  Reviewing Additional Information Requirements  The next subject of discussion concerns management’s need for addi- tional information. Your objective is to determine whether it requires  supplemental information that is currently missing from the reports  it receives. If you conclude that this is the case, you must identify  that additional information. You’ll then define new data structures  as  appropriate  to support this information later in the design process.  However, you can move on to the next part of the interview if manage- ment doesn’t require additional information.  You use the same techniques for this discussion as those you used for  this segment of the user interviews. Here are the steps you’ll follow.  1. Review the report samples with the participants once again and  ask them if there is additional information they would like to include in any of the reports.  2. Have the participants note the additional information—  including the reasons that they believe it’s necessary—on the appropriate reports. Remember that it doesn’t matter how the participants make the notations so long as they are clear, are noticeable, and are attached to the appropriate report.  3.  Identify new subjects or characteristics within the information and add them to the appropriate list.  4. Review the reports and discuss any concerns you have about them with the participants. Once your concerns are resolved, this process is complete.   Interviewing Management  155  Reviewing Future Information Requirements  Future information requirements are the next subject of discussion.  Your objective here is to determine what information management  foresees itself needing in the future. Once you’ve identified these  requirements, you can ensure that there are data structures in place  to support this information as the need for it arises.  As you begin the discussion, have the participants consider how the  organization is currently evolving. Then ask them how this evolution  will affect the information they require to make sound decisions and  how it will influence the way they guide or direct the organization.  Remember that their answers are going to be based on speculation,  as was the case with the similar questions you asked users; there’s  no way for management to predict its future needs accurately until  the organization actually begins to evolve.  It’s always a good idea,  however, to plan for the future as much as possible.  Use the Subject-  Identification Technique and Characteristic-Identification Technique  to identify new subjects and characteristics within the participants’  responses and then add the new items  if any  to the appropriate lists.  Next, make sketches of any new reports the participants might have in  mind. Identify new subjects and characteristics within each report and  add them to the appropriate lists. Then assemble these new reports in  a clearly marked folder and add it to your collection of samples.  You’re ready to move on to the last subject when you’ve accounted for  as many of management’s future information requirements as possible.  Reviewing Overall Information Requirements  The last topic of discussion concerns the organization’s overall infor- mation requirements. In management’s opinion, what generic class  of information does the organization need? Your objective here is to  discover whether there is data that the organization needs to maintain  that has not been previously discussed in either the user interviews or    156   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  the management interviews. If you determine that there is such data,  you must account for it in the database structure.  Take all of the reports that you’ve gathered throughout the analy- sis and interview processes and review them with the participants  once more. Then ask the participants to consider the information the  reports provide and how they might use that information.  Note that  they’ll have to make assumptions about how they might use the infor- mation from the new reports.  Next, ask participants to determine  whether there is information that would be useful or valuable to the  organization, but that is not currently being received by anyone within  the organization. If they determine that there is indeed some new  information that the organization could use, go through the normal  process of identifying that information and the subjects and charac- teristics represented within it. Sketch samples of new reports for the  information, as appropriate, and add the samples to your existing  collection of new reports.  For example, assume that one of the participants has identified a need  for demographic information; she believes that it would help the orga- nization identify a more specific target market for its product. None of  the existing reports furnishes this information, so you identify exactly  what she needs by working with her to create a sketch of a report that  will present this information.  She might actually sketch more than  one report, but this is neither a problem nor a cause for concern.  You  then use the appropriate techniques to identify and note the subjects  and characteristics represented within the report and add it to your  existing collection of new reports. Later in the design process, you’ll  define the data structures necessary to support the new information.  Repeat this procedure until the participants can no longer identify any  further information that the organization might find useful or valu- able. After you’re reasonably confident that you’ve accounted for all of  the organization’s information requirements, suspend the interview  process and begin the process of compiling the Preliminary Field List.   Compiling a Complete List of Fields   157  It’s important for you to understand that you may have to revisit this  process, even though you and the participants may believe that you’ve  accounted for all the information the organization could possibly use.  You’ll commonly identify new information as the database design pro- cess unfolds.  Compiling a Complete List of Fields The Preliminary Field List  Now that you have completed your analysis of the current database  and the interviews with users and management, you can create a  Preliminary Field List. This list represents the organization’s fundamen- tal data requirements and constitutes the core set of fields that you’ll  define in the database. You create the Preliminary Field List using a  two-step process.  Step 1: Review and Refine the List of Characteristics  The first step involves reviewing and refining the list of characteristics  you compiled throughout the analysis and interview process. As you  learned in Chapter 3, a field represents a characteristic of a particular  subject; therefore, each item on your list of characteristics will become  a field. Before you transform those characteristics into fields, how- ever, you first need to review the list to identify and remove duplicate  characteristics.  During the interviews, you identified various characteristics within  each participant’s responses and compiled them into a list as the  interview progressed. There were probably times when you mistak- enly added the same characteristic to the list more than once, or  unknowingly referred to the same characteristic by two or more dif- ferent names. As a result, your list of characteristics requires some  refinement.   158   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Refining Items with the Same Name  Begin refining your list of characteristics by looking for items with the  same name. When you find one or more occurrences of a particular  name, determine whether they all represent the same characteristic.  Remove all but one occurrence of the name from the list if they do  represent the same characteristic; otherwise, determine what each  instance of the name represents. You’ll often find that a duplicate  name represents the same type of characteristic as its original coun- terpart but should be associated with a different subject than its coun- terpart. In this case, you rename the duplicate to reflect how it relates  to the appropriate subject.  Assume, for example, that the item “Name” appears three times on  your list of characteristics. Your first inclination will probably be to  remove two of the occurrences because your current objective is to  eliminate duplicate characteristics. However, you should determine  whether each instance of “Name” represents a distinct characteristic  before you remove it. You can easily make this determination by exam- ining your interview notes; this will help you remember when and why  you added the item to the list.  After careful examination, you discover that the first occurrence of  “Name” represents a characteristic of the subject “Clients,” the second,  a characteristic of the subject “Employees,” and the third, a character- istic of the subject “Contacts.” You resolve this duplication by renaming  each occurrence of “Name”  using the subject as a prefix  to reflect its  true meaning. Now you’ll have three new characteristics called “Client  Name,” “Employee Name,” and “Contact Name.”  Items similar to “Name” commonly appear on a list of characteristics,  and you must address them in the same manner. You’ll commonly see  one or more occurrences of items such as “Address,” “City,” “State,”  “Zip Code,” “Phone Number,” and “Email Address,” and you can refer  to them collectively as generic items. The point here is that you must    Compiling a Complete List of Fields   159  rename each instance of a generic item to reflect its true relationship  to a particular subject, thus ensuring that you have as accurate a field  list as possible.  Refining Items Representing the Same Characteristic  Now look for items that represent the same characteristic and remove  all but one. The idea here is that a given characteristic should appear  only once in the list of characteristics. For example, assume that  “Product ,” “Product No.,” and “Product Number” appear on your list  of characteristics. It’s evident that these items all represent the same  characteristic and you need only one of them on your list. Choose the  one that conveys the intended meaning clearly, completely, and unam- biguously and remove the remaining items from the list of character- istics.  In this case, the best choice is “Product Number” because it  fulfills the previous criteria.   Ensuring Items Represent Characteristics  Finally, make sure that each item on your list represents a characteris- tic. It’s easy to place items accidentally on the list that represents sub- jects. You can test each item by asking yourself questions such as these:  Can this word be used to describe something?  Does this word represent a component, detail, or piece of something in  particular?  Does this word represent a collection of things?  Does this word represent something that can be broken down into  smaller pieces?  Depending on the item you’re working with, some questions are eas- ier to answer than others. When you find that an item represents a  subject rather than a characteristic, remove it from the list of char- acteristics and add it to the list of subjects. Be sure to identify the  new subject’s characteristics and add them to the existing list of  characteristics.   160   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  For example, say “Item” appears on your list of characteristics and  you’re not quite sure whether it represents a characteristic or a subject.  Use the preceding questions to help you make a determination.  Can “Item” be used to describe something?  Does “Item” represent a component, detail, or piece of something in  particular?  You could make a case that “Item” helps to describe a sale inasmuch  as it identifies what a customer purchased. On the other hand, you  could also say that “Item” isn’t a characteristic because it doesn’t rep- resent a singular aspect of a sale. “Date Sold,” for example, represents  a singular characteristic of a sale. Leaving the quandary surrounding  these questions unresolved, you go on to the next question:  Does “Item” represent a collection of things?  You can answer this question easily by looking at the plural form of  the word, which in this case is “Items.” If “Items” can be referred to as  a collection, it is a subject. It’s beginning to become clear that “Item”  does represent a collection of some sort, and you can make a final  determination by asking yourself the last question:  Does “Items” represent something that can be broken down into  smaller pieces?  You can answer this question by determining whether you can iden- tify any characteristics for “Items.” If you can, then “Items” definitely  represents a subject and you should move it to the list of subjects. You  also need to identify its characteristics and add them to your list of  characteristics.  Continue with this procedure until you’ve reviewed and refined  the entire list of characteristics to your satisfaction. When you are  through, you have your first version of the Preliminary Field List. Now  you’ll add new items to it and refine it further during the next step.   Compiling a Complete List of Fields   161  Step 2: Determine Whether There Are New Characteristics  in Any of Your Samples  This step involves an examination of all the samples you gathered  throughout the analysis process. Your goal is to determine whether  there are characteristics on the samples that need to be added to the  Preliminary Field List.  Begin this step by highlighting every characteristic you find on each  sample. Then, examine each characteristic and determine whether  it’s already on the Preliminary Field List; cross it out on the sample if  it’s already on the list. Next, study the remaining characteristics and  determine whether any of them has the same meaning as an existing  field; if it does, cross it out on the sample.  Use the same procedure  you used in the first step to make this determination.  Finally, add any  highlighted characteristics remaining on the samples to the Prelimi- nary Field List.  For example, say you’re working with the data collection sample shown  in Figure 6.14.  Figure 6.14  An example of a data collection sample   162   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Figure 6.15  A sample with highlighted characteristics   Highlight each characteristic you find on the sample, as shown in Fig- ure 6.15.   You’re likely to find multiple occurrences of various characteristics in  some of the samples. As you can see, both “Name” and “Phone No.”  appear twice on this particular sample. You can cross out the dupli- cates in this case because they have the same meaning as the original  instances.   To continue with the example, say you reviewed the Preliminary Field  List and found that every characteristic on the sample is already  on the list with the exception of “Name” and “Phone No.” Cross out  the existing items on the sample to show that you have accounted  for them. Before you add “Name” and “Phone No.” to the Preliminary  Field List, however, make sure that the names of these items prop- erly describe their relationship to the subject represented within the  sample. In this case, the two remaining items represent characteris- tics of a group of people known as “Contacts.” Therefore, you rename  these characteristics  using the subject as a prefix  as “Contact Name”  and “Contact Phone Number,” and then add them to the Preliminary  Field List. Repeat this procedure for each sample you’ve gathered until    Compiling a Complete List of Fields   163  you’ve gone through all the samples you’ve collected. When you’re  through, you have the second version of the Preliminary Field List.  A Side Note: Value Lists  As you examine the characteristics on a database, spreadsheet, or web  page sample, record on a sheet of paper the name of each character- istic that incorporates a value list  also known as an enumerated list .  This list specifies the acceptable range of values for a particular char- acteristic and often enforces a given business rule.  You’ll learn about  business rules in Chapter 11, “Business Rules.”  For example, say you  work for a manufacturing company that uses four specific vendors to  deliver its goods to customers across the nation. You could use a value  list to ensure that a user selects one of those four vendors to ship a  particular order. Figure 6.16 illustrates this example  note Ship Via   and also shows two common types of value list.  A value list can appear as a drop-down list or scrollable list.  A value list can also appear  as a set of buttons or checkboxes.  Figure 6.16  A database screen with two value lists  When you record the name of a characteristic that incorporates a value  list, also record the values within the list. If the list contains a large  number of values, write a brief description of the type of values in the  list and  if possible  a minimum and maximum value; otherwise, write  down each of the values. Figure 6.17 shows an example of the record  you’re creating.   164   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  Characteristics Incorporating a Value List  Characteristic  Value List  Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Components, Maintenance, Racks, Wheels  Department  Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, Service,  Category  Sales Rep  The name of every employee within the organization whose position is that of sales rep  Ship Via  DHL, FedEx, Postal Service, UPS  Figure 6.17  Recording characteristics that incorporate value lists  You can be discerning about the characteristics you choose to record.  For example, it’s unnecessary for you to record characteristics that  accept simple or obvious sets of values, such as “yes no,” “true false,”  or “active inactive.” Instead, you should record characteristics that  accept distinct, specific sets of values.  Set this sheet  or sheets  aside after you’ve finished recording the  appropriate characteristics. You’ll refer to this sheet when you define  field specifications for the fields in the database and again when you  define business rules.  The Calculated Field List  There’s one final refinement you must make to the Preliminary Field  List before you can consider it complete: You must remove every calcu- lated field and place it on a separate list. This new list becomes your  Calculated Field List. Recall from Chapter 3 that a calculated field is    Compiling a Complete List of Fields   165  one that stores the result of a string concatenation or mathematical  expression as its value. You list calculated fields separately because  you’ll use them in a specific manner later in the design process.  You build the Calculated Field List using existing fields from the  Preliminary Field List. Examine the list and determine whether there  are fields that fit the description of a calculated field. Fields that have  names containing words such as amount, total, sum, average, mini- mum, maximum, and count are likely candidates for the Calculated  Field List. Common names for calculated fields include “Subtotal,”  “Average Age,” “Discount Amount,” and “Customer Count.” As you  identify each calculated field, remove it from the Preliminary Field List  and place it in the Calculated Field List. When you’ve completed your  examination of all of the fields in the Preliminary Field List, you’ll have  two completely new lists: a third version of the Preliminary Field List  and a Calculated Field List.  Reviewing Both Lists with Users and Management  Conduct brief interviews with users and management to review the  items that appear on the Preliminary Field List and the Calculated  Field List. Your objective here is to determine whether there are fields  that have been omitted from either list. You can continue with the next  step in the design process when everyone is satisfied that the lists are  complete; otherwise, identify the fields that are missing and add them  to the appropriate list. Once the interviews are complete, you’ll have a  “final” version of each list.  Be sure you conduct these interviews because the participants’ feed- back provides you with a means of verifying the fields on both lists. Let  me remind you once again to avoid becoming too invested in the idea  that these lists are absolutely complete and final. At this point you  still may not have identified every field that needs to be included in the  database—inadvertently, you’re almost sure to miss a few fields—but    166   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  if you strive to make your lists as complete as you can, the inevitable  additions or deletions will be quick and easy to make.  CASE STUDY  You’ve already defined the mission statement and mission objectives  for Mike’s new database. Now it’s time to perform an analysis, conduct  interviews, and compile a Preliminary Field List.  First, analyze Mike’s current database. As you already know, he keeps  most of his data on paper; the only exception is the product inventory  he maintains in a spreadsheet program. Gather samples of the various  papers Mike uses to collect data and a screenshot or printout of the  spreadsheet he uses to maintain the product inventory. Assemble these  samples together in a folder for later use. For example, Figure 6.18  shows a sample of the index cards Mike uses to collect customer infor- mation, along with a screenshot of his spreadsheet program.  Next, identify the methods Mike uses to present information. He and  his staff currently produce a variety of reports that present the infor- mation they need to conduct their daily affairs. They generate most of  the reports using a word processing program. Gather samples of all  the reports and place them in a folder for later use. Figure 6.19 shows  a sample report that Mike creates on his computer.  Now you’re ready to interview Mike’s staff. Here are some points to  remember as you’re conducting the interviews.   cid:129  Identify the types of data staff members are using and how they  use that data.

He believes this information would help him determine which  bikes he should consistently keep in stock. Such a report does not cur- rently exist, so have Mike sketch it out on a sheet of paper. Next, iden- tify the subjects and characteristics represented within the report and  add them to the appropriate list. Then add the new report to your group  of report samples.

Remove all duplicate characteristics, delete items that represent the  same characteristic, and refine those items that have generic names.   Remember the problem with the characteristic called “Name”? If you  find such characteristics, now is the time to resolve them.  Next, review  all your samples and determine whether they contain characteristics  that do not currently appear on the Preliminary Field List. Add to the  list any new characteristics that you find. When you complete these  tasks, you have the first version of your Preliminary Field List.  Now you remove all the calculated fields from the Preliminary Field  List and place them on their own list; this becomes your new Calcu- lated Field List.

Summary  This chapter began by discussing why you should analyze the orga- nization’s current database. You learned that the analysis helps you  identify aspects of the current database that will be useful to you when  you design the new database. Armed with this information, you can  design a database that best suits the organization’s needs. Next, we  briefly looked at the two types of databases organizations commonly  used: paper-based databases and legacy databases. We ended this  discussion by identifying the three steps used in the analysis process:  reviewing the way data is collected, reviewing the way information is  presented, and conducting interviews with the organization’s staff.   172   Chapter 6  Analyzing the Current Database  The chapter continued with a discussion of the review process. You  learned how to review the ways the organization collects its data and  how to assemble a set of data collection samples. Then you learned how  to review the ways the organization presents information and how to  assemble a set of report samples.  Next, we discussed the process you use to conduct interviews, and you  learned why interviews are useful at this stage of the design process.  During this discussion you learned two techniques that are crucial to  the success of interviews: the Subject-Identification Technique and the  Characteristic-Identification Technique.  Conducting user interviews was the next subject of discussion. We  examined the four issues you must address during these interviews,  along with the techniques you use to address them. Next, we dis- cussed conducting management interviews. Here you learned about the  issues and techniques these interviews incorporate.  Finally, we discussed the process of compiling a list of fields based  on the list of characteristics and the characteristics that appear in  the samples. You learned that you decompose the field list into two  separate lists: a Preliminary Field List and a Calculated Field List.  The Preliminary Field List enumerates the organization’s fundamen- tal data requirements and establishes the core set of fields you must  define in the database. The Calculated Field List consists of fields that  contain values resulting from string concatenations or mathematical  expressions.  Review Questions  1.

For example, a medical clinic keeps track of, among  other things, its patients, doctors, and appointments; an equipment  rental business must maintain data on its customers, equipment, and  rental agreements; and a registrar’s office is concerned  at the very least   with students, teaching staff, and courses. In every case—and in any  other scenario you can imagine—a table within the database represents  each subject. Furthermore, each table is composed of fields, which rep- resent the characteristics that define or describe the subject of the table.  Tables constitute the very foundation of the database, and they guaran- tee a solid and sound foundation when they are properly designed.  175   176   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Defining the Preliminary Table List  During this portion of the database design process, you’ll define a Pre- liminary Table List that you’ll use to identify and establish the tables  for the new database. You’ll use three procedures to develop this list.  The first involves using the Preliminary Field List, the second involves  using the list of subjects you gathered during the interviewing process,  and the third involves using the mission objectives you defined at the  beginning of the database design process. You’ll then move on to build  the structure of each table using fields from the Preliminary Field List.  Identifying Implied Subjects  The process of defining the tables for the database begins with a  review of the Preliminary Field List. Your objective is to identify sub- jects that are implied by the fields on the list.  You may wonder why you’re reviewing the Preliminary Field List  instead of starting with the list of subjects. The list of subjects does  seem to be a more intuitive place to start. After all, you’ve carefully  built this list during the interview process, and you’ve been influenced  by the conversations you’ve had with the users and management.  Surely, all of this has helped you identify every subject that needs to be  represented in the database. You may be correct, but you could have a  minor problem if you’re wrong: missing tables.  Studying the fields on the primary field list helps you identify subjects  from an unbiased viewpoint—you’re letting the fields “talk” to you. It’s  crucial that you now look at this list as objectively as possible—as  though you’ve never seen it before—without any of the biases you’ve  assimilated during the interview process. This enables you to see how  certain groups of fields suggest specific subjects, some of which may  not have been identified during the interview process. You can also  use the Preliminary Field List to verify many of the subjects on the list    Defining the Preliminary Table List   177  of subjects. Using the Preliminary Field List in these ways allows you  to cross-check your previous work and helps you ensure that the new  database structure includes all of the necessary subjects.  As you review the Preliminary Field List, ask yourself whether a cer- tain set of fields defines or describes a particular subject. Move on to  another set of fields if nothing readily comes to mind. When you can  infer a subject from the field in the list, enter that subject on a new  Preliminary Table List. Figure 7.1 shows a partial sample of a Prelimi- nary Field List and illustrates how a subject can be suggested by a set  of fields.  Preliminary Field List  Course Code  Course Name  Student First Name  Student Last Name  Course Description  Home Phone  Lab Fee  Faculty First Name  Faculty Last Name  Address  City  State  Date Hired  Phone Extension  Phone Extension  Status  These fields suggest “Courses.”  These fields suggest “Faculty.”  These fields suggest “Students.”  Figure 7.1  Using the Preliminary Field List to identify subjects  Continue your review until you’ve scanned all the fields and identified  as many subjects as possible. Be sure to add each subject you identify  to the Preliminary Table List. This list will grow as you work with the  list of subjects and mission objectives. Figure 7.2 shows an example of  the first version of a Preliminary Table List.   178   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Preliminary Table List  Classrooms  Courses  Faculty  Labs  Students  Figure 7.2  The first version of the Preliminary Table List  Using the List of Subjects  Now, create a second version of the Preliminary Table List by merging  the list of subjects  created during the interviews with users and man- agement  with the first version of the Preliminary Table List  compiled  by studying the Preliminary Field List . This new version contains a  more complete list of tables. Merging the two lists is a three-step pro- cess, which involves resolving duplicate items, resolving items that rep- resent the same subject, and combining the remaining items together  into one list.  Step 1: Resolve Duplicate Items  Start this step by reviewing and cross-checking each item on the list of  subjects against the items on the Preliminary Table List. Your objective  here is to identify duplicate items, which are items on the list of sub- jects that already appear on the Preliminary Table List. You must be  very careful how you resolve the duplicate items that you find. Begin  by determining whether the items represent different subjects, despite  the fact that they share the same name.  Use your interview notes  as necessary to help you make your decision.  If they do represent    Defining the Preliminary Table List   179  different subjects, rename each item so that it accurately identifies  the subject it represents and then add both items to the Preliminary  Table List; otherwise, determine whether they truly represent the same  subject. When you conclude that both items do represent the same  subject, cross out the item on the list of subjects and keep the one that  appears on the Preliminary Table List. Then resume the review until  you’ve examined all of the items on both the list of subjects and the  Preliminary Table List. Let’s take a look at an example of this process.  Assume that you’re developing a database for an equipment rental  business, and you’re working with the list of subjects and the Prelimi- nary Table List shown in Figure 7.3.  List of Subjects  Preliminary Table List  Clients  Employees  Equipment  Rental Agreements  Services  Customers  Equipment  Rental Agreements  Sales Reps  Figure 7.3  The list of subjects and the Preliminary Table List for an equipment  rental business  As you review these lists, you discover two duplicate items: “Equip- ment” and “Rental Agreements.” These items warrant further examina- tion, so you start with “Equipment” and try to determine whether each  occurrence represents a different subject. In reviewing your interview  notes, you find that “Equipment” on the list of subjects represents  items such as tools, appliances, and audiovisual equipment. Then  you remember that “Equipment” on the Preliminary Table List also  includes trucks, vans, and trailers. You review your interview notes  further and discover that vehicle rentals are treated differently from    180   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  “regular” equipment rentals. Therefore, each occurrence of “Equip- ment” does represent a different subject. You resolve the duplication by  keeping one occurrence of “Equipment” and renaming the other “Vehi- cles.” You then list both items on the Preliminary Table List.  Now you go through the same process with “Rental Agreements.”  Fortunately, you discover that both occurrences share exactly the  same meaning. The only thing you have to do in this case is cross out  “Rental Agreements” on the list of subjects. Now you can continue your  review until you’ve inspected each item on the list of subjects. Figure  7.4 shows the revised list of subjects and the Preliminary Table List.  List of Subjects  Preliminary Table List  Clients  Employees  Equipment  Rental Agreements  Services  Customers  Equipment  Sales Reps  Vehicles  Rental Agreements  Figure 7.4  The revised list of subjects and the revised Preliminary Table List   first view   Step 2: Resolve Items That Represent the Same Subject  Your objective during this step of the merge process is to determine  whether an item on the list of subjects and an item on the Preliminary  Table List represent the same subject even though they have different  names. When you identify such a set of items, select the name that  best represents the subject and use it as the sole identifier for that  subject. Then deal with the name in this manner.   cid:129  If the name you’ve selected already appears on the Preliminary  Table List, cross out its counterpart on the list of subjects.   Defining the Preliminary Table List   181   cid:129  If the name appears on the list of subjects, remove its counter- part on the Preliminary Table List and replace it with the name from the list of subjects.  Repeat this process until you’ve covered all the items on the list of  subjects.  Continuing with the equipment rental business example, assume  you’ve discovered that “Clients” and “Employees” on the list of sub- jects and “Customers” and “Sales Reps” on the Preliminary Table List  represent  respectively  the same subject  see Figure 7.4 . Deciding to  deal with “Clients” and “Customers” first, you review your interview  notes and determine that “Customers” is the name that best represents  both the people and the organizations that rent equipment from the  business. You then resolve the duplication by keeping “Customers” and  crossing out “Clients.” Moving on to the next set of duplicate items,  you decide to keep “Employees” and discard “Sales Reps” because you  believe that “Employees” best describes those people who are employed  by the business, regardless of their position. Figure 7.5 shows a  revised version of both lists and the resolution of the duplicate items.

All you do is  add the remaining items from the list of subjects to the Preliminary  Table List. Then throw away the list of subjects—you won’t need it any- more. The list that remains becomes the second version of the Prelim- inary Table List. That’s all there is to it! Figure 7.6 shows the second  version of the Preliminary Table List, which is the result of merging the  two lists shown in Figure 7.5.  Preliminary Table List  Customers  Employees  Equipment  Services  Vehicles  Rental Agreements  Figure 7.6  The second version of the Preliminary Table List  Using the Mission Objectives  In this third and final procedure, you use the mission objectives to  determine whether you’ve overlooked any subjects during the previous  two procedures. This is your final opportunity to add tables to the Pre- liminary Table List.  Start with the first mission objective, and use the Subject- Identification  Technique to identify the subjects represented in that statement.  Underline each subject you identify and then cross-check it against the    Defining the Preliminary Table List   183  items on the Preliminary Table List. Use the same techniques here that  you used in the previous procedure.  1. When an item you underlined in a mission objective statement  matches an item on the Preliminary Table List, determine whether the items represent different subjects. If they do, assign an appropriate name to each occurrence and then add each one to the Preliminary Table List; otherwise, cross out the duplicate item on the mission objective.  2. When an item you underlined in the mission objective statement  has a name that is synonymous with the name of an item on the Preliminary Table List and both items represent the same subject, select the name that best identifies that subject and use it in the Preliminary Table List.  3. When an item you underlined in the mission objective statement  represents a new subject, add it to the Preliminary Table List.  Repeat these steps until you’ve worked through all the mission objec- tives. Here’s an example of how you use these techniques to review the  mission objectives.  Assume that you’re designing a database for a flight training school.  You’re just starting this particular process, and you’ve just used the  Subject-Identification Technique on the following statement:  We need to maintain data on our pilots and their certifications.  You now cross-check the subjects you identified in this mission objec- tive against the items in the Preliminary Table List shown in Figure 7.7.  In this case, you cross out “pilots” in the mission objective statement  because it already exists on the Preliminary Table List and it rep- resents the same subject. You then decide to examine “certifications”  further, and, after some careful thought, you make these observations.   184   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Preliminary Table List  Maintenance History  Courses  Employees  Pilots  Planes  Students  Figure 7.7  The Preliminary Table List for a flight training school  1.  2.  3.  4.  It does not appear on the Preliminary Table List.  It doesn’t duplicate any item on the Preliminary Table List.  Its name is not synonymous with any item on the Preliminary Table List.  It doesn’t represent the same subject as any other item on the Preliminary Table List.  These findings indicate that “certifications” is a new item and should  be added to the Preliminary Table List. So you add it to the Prelimi- nary Table List and cross it out on the mission objective statement;  this shows you that you’ve already dealt with this particular item. Fig- ure 7.8 shows the revised version of the Preliminary Table List.  Defining the Final Table List  Your Preliminary Table List is as complete as it can be at this point,  so you’ll now transform it into a Final Table List. This new list incor- porates two elements that are not currently on the Preliminary Table  List: table type and table description. Figure 7.9 shows an example of a  Final Table List.

Course information must always reflect the addtion of new courses, the deletion of old courses, and the continuing evolution of existing courses.  Courses  Data  Figure 7.9  An example of a Final Table List   186   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  A table type allows you to classify a table by the role it plays within  the database and provides you with a means of identifying tables that  function in a similar manner. The table’s role determines its type, and  there are four table types that you can associate with a given table.  1. A data table represents a subject that is important to the orga- nization and is the primary foundation of the information that the database provides.  You’ll learn more about data tables later in this chapter.   2. A linking table establishes a link between two tables in a many- to-many relationship.  Chapter 10, “Table Relationships,” covers linking tables in more detail.   3. A subset table contains fields that are related to a particular data table and further describes the data table’s subject in a very specific manner.  You’ll learn more about subset tables later in this chapter.   4. A validation table contains relatively static data and is a crucial component of data integrity.  Chapter 11, “Business Rules,” pro- vides further details on this type of table.   A table description provides a clear definition of the subject represented  by the table and states why the subject is important to the organiza- tion. There are certain guidelines that govern how you create a table  description, and you’ll learn about them later in this chapter. There is  a final task you have to perform before you transform your Preliminary  Table List into the Final Table List: refining the table names.  Refining the Table Names  Naming a table is a more complex affair than you may realize at the  moment. As you learned in Chapter 3, “Terminology,” a table represents  a single subject; therefore, its name must clearly identify the subject it  represents. The following guidelines will help you create table names    Defining the Final Table List   187  that are clear, unambiguous, descriptive, and meaningful. They will  also help ensure that you name your tables in a consistent manner.  Guidelines for Creating Table Names   cid:129  Create a unique, descriptive name that is meaningful to the entire  organization. Using unique names helps to ensure that each table clearly represents a different subject and that everyone in the organization will understand what the table represents.  If you encounter duplicate table names at this point, resolve the prob- lem using the techniques you learned earlier in this chapter.  Choose names that are descriptive enough to be self-explanatory. “Vehicle Maintenance” is an example of a good, descriptive name. Defining a unique and descriptive name does take some work on your part, but it’s well worth the effort in the long run.   cid:129  Create a name that accurately, clearly, and unambiguously iden-  tifies the subject of the table. Vague or ambiguous names usu- ally indicate that the table represents more than one subject. When you encounter such a name, identify the subjects the table truly represents and then treat each subject as a separate table. “Dates” is a good example of a vague table name. You really don’t know what the table represents without referring to its descrip- tion. For example, assume you’re designing a database for an entertainment agency and this table appears in the Preliminary Table List. Upon seeing this table name, you decide to review your interview notes. You discover that one person says “Dates” represents appointments for client meetings, and another person says it represents booking dates for the agency’s stable of enter- tainers. This table clearly represents two subjects, so you remove “Dates” from the Preliminary Table List and replace it with two new tables called “Client Meetings” and “Entertainer Schedules.”  Possibly the most vague and ambiguous name you could assign to a table is “Miscellaneous”—it doesn’t identify a single subject   188   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  whatsoever. You might occasionally feel compelled to create a  “Miscellaneous” table because you just can’t figure out what to  do with certain fields on your Preliminary Field List. When that  happens, stop, take a break, and then come back and reexamine  those fields. Carefully and methodically apply the design tech- niques you’ve learned, and you’re sure to determine what to do  with the fields after all.   cid:129  Use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the sub- ject of the table. Everyone in the organization should be able to identify what the table represents without having to read its description. Although your objective is to create a short, succinct table name, avoid using a minimalist approach. “TD_1” is a good example of a name that is exceedingly short. You won’t have the slightest idea what this table represents unless you know the meaning of each character in the name. You should also avoid going in the opposite direction as well. “Multiuse Vehicle Mainte- nance Equipment” is much too long and can easily be shortened to just “Equipment.”   cid:129  Do not use words that convey physical characteristics. Avoid using  words such as file, record, and table in the table name because they add a level of confusion that you don’t need. A table name that includes this type of word is very likely to represent more than one subject. Consider the name “Patient Record.” On the surface, this may appear to be an acceptable name. You’ll realize, however, that there are potential problems with this name when you take some time to think about what a “patient record” is sup- posed to represent. The name contains a word that you’re trying hard to avoid  record  and it potentially represents three subjects: “patients,” “doctors,” and “examinations.” With this in mind, remove “patients” from the Preliminary Table List and replace it with three new tables, one for each of the three subjects.   cid:129  Do not use acronyms and abbreviations. Acronyms are hard to  decipher, abbreviations rarely convey the subject of the table, and   Defining the Final Table List   189  both violate the first guideline in this list. Take acronyms, for  example. Say you’re helping an organization revise its database  structure and you encounter a table named “SC.” How do you  know what the table represents without knowing the meaning of  the letters themselves? The fact is that you can’t easily identify  the subject of the table. What’s more, you may find that the table  means different things to different departments in the organiza- tion. So you decide to conduct a brief interview with some of the  staff in order to determine what the letters represent.  Now, this  is the scary part.  To your disbelief, you discover that the folks in  personnel think it stands for “Steering Committees”; the informa- tion systems staff believes it to be “System Configurations”; and  the people in security insist that it represents “Security Codes.”  This example clearly illustrates why you should make every effort  to avoid using abbreviations and acronyms in a table name.   cid:129  Do not use proper names or other words that will unduly restrict  the data that can be entered into the table. This guideline will keep you from falling into the trap of creating duplicate table structures. A name such as “Southwest Region Employees,” for example, severely restricts the data that you can enter into this table. As the organization grows, how will you deal with employ- ees from other regions? When the organization begins to hire employees in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, you’ll have to create a “Pacific Northwest Region Employees” table, and you’ll have to create a “Western Region Employees” table when the organization begins to hire folks in Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and California.  Proper database design principles dictate that you should not create duplicate structures such as these because they can be quite problematic.  1. Users could have a difficult time retrieving data from all three  tables simultaneously.   190   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  2. The person maintaining the database would have the added  responsibility of ensuring that the tables are always struc- turally synchronized. If he adds, modifies, or deletes a field in one table, he must take the same action on all the other tables.  3. The person maintaining the database would also have the  added responsibility of ensuring synchronized data integrity between the tables. He must be able to guarantee that data is completely and accurately transferred from one table to the other when an employee relocates from one region to another.   cid:129  Do not use a name that implicitly or explicitly identifies more than  one subject. This is one of the most common mistakes you can make with a table name, and it is relatively easy to identify. This type of name typically contains the word and or or and charac- ters such as the slash  \  or ampersand  & ; examples include “Department or Branch” and “Facility\Building.” A table with an ambiguous name suggests that you may have not identified the subject clearly or accurately during the analysis and interview processes. You can rectify this problem by reviewing your notes and conducting further analysis and interviews as necessary. Just remember that you must always ensure that each table rep- resents only one subject.  Another name that falls under this category is “Miscellaneous.”  Yes, here’s that name again!  A moment ago, I said that this name didn’t identify a single subject whatsoever; this is a cor- rect and valid assertion. It is also true, however, that the name implicitly identifies more than one subject; you can’t specifically identify the subjects because the name is vague and ambiguous. Merriam-Webster’s online dictionary defines the word itself as follows:  Miscellaneous adj. 1. consisting of diverse things or members;  hetero geneous. 2. having various traits.   Defining the Final Table List   191  You can clearly see the problems that this name creates, so you  should not use it as a table name at all. There are certainly good  reasons not to do so.   cid:129  Do use the plural form of the name. As you know, a table rep- resents a single subject, which can be an object or event. You can take this definition one step further and state that a table represents a collection of similar objects or events. For example, a sales representative wants to maintain data on all of his cus- tomers, not just a single one; and a car rental business wants to keep track of all its vehicles, not just the blue BMW. Using the plural form of the table name is a sound idea because it makes clear your intention to refer to a collection. Collections, of course, always take the plural  “Boats,” not “Boat” . In contrast, words that identify fields are always singular  “Home Phone,” not “Home Phones” . Following this rule will make it easy for you to differen- tiate between table names and field names in any documentation you create for the database.  As you rename your tables, remem- ber that the plural form of some words does not end in s or es. For instance, the singular and plural forms of “equipment” are exactly the same.   Use these guidelines to refine each table name on the Preliminary Table  List. When you’re finished, this list becomes your Final Table List and  remains so for the duration of the database design process. Note that  the list is “final” only in the sense that you’ve accounted for all the tables  that you identified throughout the entire analysis process. It’s very likely  that you’ll add new tables to this list based on requirements imposed by  relationships, data integrity, or other information that you develop.  ❖ Note  The guideline for using a plural form for a table name is a particularly good one while you’re working on the logical design of the database. It makes it very easy to differentiate table   192   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  names from field names, especially when you’re displaying them  on a projection screen or when you’ve written them all across a  white board in a conference room.  Keep in mind, however, that the table names are likely to change  once you  or the database developer in charge of implementing  the database  begin implementing the database into a specific  RDBMS application. The names will then need to conform to the  naming convention that developers commonly use for the RDBMS.  Indicating the Table Types  As you learned earlier in this chapter, you indicate each table’s type on  the Final Table List. Recall that the four classifications you can use to  identify the table type are data, linking, subset, and validation.  When you first create your Final Table List, every item on the list is  a data table because it represents a subject that is important to the  organization and serves as the primary foundation of the information  that the database provides. There will be no linking tables or valida- tion tables on the list because you have not yet defined relationships or  imposed data integrity.  You’ll address these issues later in the design  process.  The list will not contain subset tables because you define  them after you assign fields to the data tables.  For the moment, designate each table on the Final Table List as a data  table. You’ll assign other table types later as the database design pro- cess continues to unfold.  Composing the Table Descriptions  The table description is another aspect of a table that you record on  the Final Table List. A table description is crucial because it helps    Defining the Final Table List   193  everyone understand why a given table exists and why the organiza- tion is concerned with collecting the data for that table. In fact, the  description must explicitly define the table and state its importance to  the organization. It doesn’t matter whether the definition comes first  or you use more than one sentence to convey this information—both  the definition and the explanation of the table’s importance must be in  the description. The table description also provides a means of vali- dating the need for a table—if you are unable to explain why a table is  important to the organization, then you need to determine when and  how the table was identified and whether it really is necessary at all.  Just as you had guidelines to help define table names, you also have  a set of guidelines to help you compose a table description that is  focused, concise, unambiguous, and clear.  Guidelines for Composing a Table Description   cid:129  Include a statement that accurately defines the table. Anyone  should easily be able to determine the identity of the table from its description without any confusion or uncertainty. Here’s an example of a poor definition for a table named “Suppliers” in a bakery database. As you can see, it’s not very accurate:  Suppliers—the companies that supply us with ingredients and  equipment  What if the bakery receives some of its ingredients from local  farmers? The farmers certainly don’t qualify as “companies.”  What type of equipment do these suppliers supply? Cooking  utensils? Hand trucks? Delivery racks? Here’s a much better  definition of suppliers:  Suppliers—the people and organizations from which we pur- chase ingredients and equipment  This statement can be used in the table description as the table  definition.   194   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures   cid:129  Include a statement that explains why this table is important to the organization. A table contains data that is collected, maintained, manipulated, and retrieved by the organization for a particular reason. Your statement should explain why the data is important to the organization. Keeping in mind that this statement becomes part of your table description, you might be tempted to construct a statement such as this:  We need the Suppliers table to keep track of the names,  addresses, phone numbers, and contact names of all our  suppliers.  This statement is inadequate because it emphasizes only what  needs to be stored in the Suppliers table instead of amplifying  why the data is important to the business. The next example  conveys a better sense of why the information is important:  Supplier information is vital to the bakery because it allows us  to maintain a constant supply of ingredients and ensure that  our equipment is always in working order.  This is a more effective statement because it conveys the impor- tance of the data by identifying the services the suppliers pro- vide to the bakery. It also implies that the bakery could run  out of ingredients or have a hard time keeping its equipment in  top shape without the suppliers’ services. This statement now  reflects why the table is important to the organization.   cid:129  Compose a description that is clear and succinct. Avoid the com- mon mistake of restating or rephrasing the table name in your table description, as in this example:  Student Schedule—the class schedule of the student  Don’t be too brief or too verbose. You want to make sure that  everyone can identify the table and understand its importance to  the organization, but you also want to avoid furnishing too much    Defining the Final Table List   195  information. Here’s an example of a description that is quite  lengthy and provides more information than is necessary:  Student Schedule—All the classes that a student will attend   including the days, the times, and the faculty conducting the  class  during the course of the school year. The data in this  table is important because it will let the student know the  name of the class and when and where he’s supposed to be.  Also, the student will know the duration of the class, as well as  the name of the teacher who is teaching the class.  This can be recast more clearly and succinctly as follows:  Student Schedule—Those classes that the student is scheduled  to attend during this school year. The information provided by  this table helps the student implement effective time manage- ment and enables the school to figure class loads and student  loads.  The first sentence in this example provides the definition of the  table, and the second sentence states why the table is important  to the academic organization.   cid:129  Do not include implementation-specific information in your table  description, such as how or where the table is used. Avoid state- ments that indicate how you will specifically use this table, or how you will physically access it. This type of information is germane to the database implementation process, which is wholly separate from the database design process you’re learning in this book. Here is an example of a description containing this type of inappropriate information:  Student Schedule—Those classes that the student is scheduled  to attend during this school year. This information is used by  the registrar and is accessed from the Student Admissions  menu in the Registration Program.   cid:129  Do not make the table description for one table dependent upon  the table description of another table. Each table description   196   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  should be self-explanatory and independent from every other  table description; it should be absolutely unnecessary for you to  cross-reference one table description against another. This is the  type of statement you’re trying to avoid:  Dependents—the spouse, children, or wards of a given  employee.  See description of Employee table for further  information.   Here’s a much better description:  Dependents—the spouse, children, or wards of a given  employee. This information allows us to make the appropriate  tax deductions for the employee, and is necessary for the bene- fits programs in which the employee is enrolled.   cid:129  Do not use examples in a table description. An example is a  valuable communication tool that helps you convey a particular meaning or concept and is very effective when you use it wisely. But an example depends on supplemental information  and, in some cases, further examples  to complete the idea it’s supposed to convey. For instance, just think of the number of examples you would have to use in order to define fully what a table represents. A well-defined description is clear, succinct, and self-explanatory; therefore, it does not require an example to convey its meaning.  Interviewing Users and Management  Now you’ll define table descriptions for the tables on the Final Table  List. You’ll conduct interviews with both users and management, and  enlist their aid in establishing each table’s definition and importance  to the organization.  This is one of the few times that you’ll actually  interview both groups together.  Your main objective is to get a con- sensus on general descriptions for the tables. When your interviews  are complete, take your notes and compose final table descriptions,  making sure to follow the guidelines outlined earlier in this chapter.  Then confer with both parties once more to make certain that the    Defining the Final Table List   197  descriptions are acceptable and easily understood by all. The Final  Table List is complete when everyone has agreed on the descriptions.  Consider this example: Assume you’re developing a database for a local  software training organization. Your assistant, John, is conducting an  interview with some of the people from the organization. Specifically,  he’s speaking to Mark from the administration department; Frits, the  instructor coordinator; Sara, the vice president of sales; and Caroline,  the head of the organization. The dialogue that follows is a partial  transcript of John’s interview. John is currently discussing the Stu- dents table.  Unlike the interviews you conducted during the analysis and  requirements review stages of the design process, you no longer  need to involve everyone in the organization. But you will work  with a representative group of users and management for the  interviews you’ll conduct throughout the remainder of the design  process.  JOHN:   FRITS:   SARA:   MARK:   “Okay, let’s talk about the Students table. How would you  describe a ‘student’?” “A student is a private individual who comes in for one of  our classes.” “That’s only partially true. A student can also be an  individual that an organization sends to our classes. For  example, many of our students come from local banks  and insurance companies, and those organizations pay  for the students’ tuitions.” “Yes, you’re quite right. I guess we can simply say that  a student is an individual who comes in for one of our  classes.”   John makes a note of what Mark just said.     198   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  JOHN:   “Good—got it. Does everyone agree with Mark?”   Everyone nods in approval.    “Great. Now, how would you explain to someone why stu- dent information is important to this organization?”  CAROLINE:  “Without students, we don’t have a business!” FRITS:   “If we can keep track of the students who attend our  classes, we can send them information regarding our  new classes.” “Keeping track of this information allows us to keep bill- ing and contact information current. This is especially  true for organizations that send their employees to our  classes. Training coordinators move on to other posi- tions, and we have to know the name of the new person  we’ll be dealing with.” “Good point. Does anyone have anything further to add?  No? Okay, does everyone agree with what has been said  so far?”  SARA:   JOHN:    Everyone once again nods in approval. Because no additional com- ments are made, John jots down some final notes and moves on to  the next table.   As you can see, conducting this type of interview is a fairly straightfor- ward affair. Notice how John attempts to get a consensus as he recog- nizes that no one has anything else to say about the topic at hand. He  then makes note of the points that will help him compose the descrip- tion and moves on to his next topic.  After John has finished conducting the interview, he uses his notes to  develop a table description for each table on the Final Table List. He’ll  have to interpret and study the participants’ responses in order to  develop a suitable table description. Based on his examination, John  writes the following description:   Associating Fields with Each Table   199  Students—those individuals who attend our classes. The information  provided by the data in the Students table allows our organization  to further promote our classes and supports proper communications  with the students.  John then writes a description for each table on the Final Table List.  When he’s finished, he’ll speak with Mark, Frits, Sara, and Caroline  once more to make sure the descriptions are acceptable and that  everyone understands them without any difficulty.  Associating Fields with Each Table  In Chapter 3 you learned that tables are composed of fields. During this  stage of the database design process, you’ll assign fields to each table  on the Final Table List using fields from your Preliminary Field List.  Assigning fields to a table is a relatively easy process: Determine which  fields best represent characteristics of the table’s subject and assign  them to that table. Repeat this procedure for every table on the Final  Table List. If you think you can use a field or set of fields to represent  characteristics of more than one table, then assign them accordingly.  You’ll discover whether you’ve assigned the appropriate fields to each  table later when you go through the process of refining the table  structures.  ❖ Note  In the following examples, you’ll note that I ask you to use sheets of paper for specific procedures. Using paper helps you avoid the temptation of using an RDBMS program to design your database. I cannot overemphasize or overstate the fact that you should not use the computer at all until the database design process is complete unless you’re using some type of data- base-design-specific software. By heeding this advice, you will avoid the traps I discuss later in Chapter 14 “Bad Design—What Not to Do.”   200   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Begin this process by taking a sheet of legal paper and laying it in  front of you lengthwise from left to right. Write the name of each table   from the Final Table List  across the top of the paper, starting at the  left-hand side; leave enough space between the table names to give you  enough room to list lengthy field names underneath them. Repeat this  procedure, using as many sheets as you need to account for every table  on the list. Continuing with the school database example, Figure 7.10  shows the set of table structures currently under development.  Table Structures  Courses  Subjects  Instructors  Students  Figure 7.10  Setting up a sheet for listing table structures  Next, assign fields from the Preliminary Field List to each table. Deter- mine which fields best describe or define a table’s subject and then list  these fields underneath the table name. After you’ve assigned all of the  fields you believe to be appropriate for the table, move on to the next  table and repeat the process. Continue in this manner until you’ve  assigned fields to all the tables. Figure 7.11 shows a partial set of table  structures.   Associating Fields with Each Table   201  Table Structures  Classes  Subjects  Instructors  Students  Class Number  Subject Name  Instructor Name  Student Name  Class Name  Subject Description  Instructor SSN  Student SSN  Subject Name  Category  Instructor Address  Student Address  Instructor Name  Credits  Instructor Phone  Student Phone  Room Number  Date Hired  Pay Rate  Figure 7.11  Listing tables with their associated fields  ❖ Note  Before you work through the remainder of the chap- ter, now is a good time to recall a principle I presented in the Introduction:  Focus on the concept or technique and its intended results, not  on the example used to illustrate it.  I bring this to your attention once again because you’ll certainly  wonder why I created an example in a particular manner. Maybe  you’ve thought of a different or better approach to the problem,  and you might have thoroughly valid reasons for using it. But  don’t let the example mislead you. I’ve fashioned each example in  a specific manner for the sole reason of illustrating the concept  or technique at hand. Therefore, study the way that I correct the  problems you see in a particular example so that you can use  those techniques when you encounter similar problems in your  database.   202   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Refining the Fields  Now that you’ve assigned fields to each table, you’ll refine the fields by  improving the field names and resolving any structural problems that  may exist. Then you’ll refine the tables further by establishing that  you’ve assigned the appropriate fields to each table and that the table  structures are sound.  Improving the Field Names  As you know, a field represents a characteristic of the subject of the  table to which it belongs. You can easily identify the characteristic a  field is supposed to represent when that field has an appropriate name.  A field name that is ambiguous, vague, or unclear is a sure sign of  trouble and suggests that you have not thoroughly identified the pur- pose of the field.  Earlier in this chapter, you learned a set of guidelines for naming a  table. Now you’ll learn another set of guidelines that you’ll apply to field  names. Fortunately, many of them are similar to the guidelines govern- ing table names, so you’re already familiar with most of the concepts.  Guidelines for Creating Field Names   cid:129  Create a unique, descriptive name that is meaningful to the entire organization. A given field name should appear only once in the entire database; the only exception to this rule occurs when the field serves to establish a relationship between two tables. Make certain the name is descriptive enough to convey its meaning accurately to everyone who sees it.  Chapter 10 covers this issue in greater detail.    cid:129  Create a name that accurately, clearly, and unambiguously identi- fies the characteristic a field represents. “Phone Number” is a good example of an inaccurate, ambiguous field name. What kind of phone number does it represent? A home phone? An office   Refining the Fields   203  phone? A cellular phone? Learn to be specific. If you need to  record each of these types of phone numbers, then create “Home  Phone,” “Work Phone,” and “Cellular Phone” fields.  In Chapter 6, “Analyzing the Current Database,” you learned  how to resolve generic field names, such as “Address,” “City,” and  “State,” by using the table name as a prefix for the field name.  This produces names such as “Employee Address,” “Customer  Address,” and “Supplier Address.” When you have field names  such as these, you can abbreviate the prefix  for brevity’s sake   by using the first three or four letters of the table name as the  revised prefix. This allows you to transform the previous field  names into “EmpAddress,” “CustAddress,” and “SuppAddress.”  This technique helps you fulfill not only this guideline, but the  previous one as well.  ❖ Note  The degree to which you use prefixes within a table is a matter of style. When a table contains generic field names, some database designers will choose to prefix the generic names only, while others elect to prefix all of the field names within the table. Regardless of the prefix method you choose to use, it is very important that you use it consistently throughout the database structure.  I personally prefer to prefix the generic field names only, and I’ll  follow this preference throughout the remainder of the book.   cid:129  Use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the mean-  ing of the characteristic the field represents. You want to avoid lengthy field names, but at the same time, you also want to avoid using a single word as a field name if that word is inappropri- ate. For example, if you’re trying to record the date a particu- lar employee joined the organization, “Hired” is too short  and slightly vague  and “Date That the Employee Was Hired” is too   204   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  long! “Date Hired,” however, is a more appropriate name and  accurately represents the characteristic the field represents.   cid:129  Do not use acronyms, and use abbreviations judiciously. Acronyms  can be hard to decipher and often lead to misunderstanding. Imagine a field named “CAD_SW.” How would you determine what the field represents? On the other hand, you can use abbre- viations so long as you use them sparingly and handle them with care. Only use an abbreviation if it supplements or enhances the field name in a positive manner. An abbreviation shouldn’t make a field name ambiguous or diminish its meaning.   cid:129  Do not use words that could confuse the meaning of the field  name. A field name that contains redundant words or synonyms can make the name’s meaning unclear and subject to misinter- pretation. For instance, consider the name “Digital Identification Code Number.” “Digital” and “number” are redundant, so you can eliminate either one without diminishing the field name’s mean- ing. Let’s assume that you decide to eliminate “digital.” You can split the remaining name into two smaller names: “Identification Code” and “Identification Number.” These names are often synon- ymous, and you can easily use either as the final field name. In this situation, just use the name that is most meaningful within the organization.   cid:129  Do not use names that implicitly or explicitly identify more than  one characteristic. These types of names are easy to spot because they typically use the word and or or. Field names that contain a slash  \  or an ampersand  &  are dead giveaways as well. When you encounter a field with a name such as “Area or Location” or “Phone\Fax,” identify each characteristic that the name implies, and create a new field for the characteristic. Then test the new field name against these guidelines to ensure that the name is sound.   Refining the Fields   205   cid:129  Use the singular form of the name. A field with a plural name,  such as “Skills,” implies that it may contain two or more values for a given record, which is not a good idea.  You’ll learn more about this later in the chapter.  A field name is singular because it represents a single characteristic of the subject of the table to which it belongs. A table name, on the other hand, is plural because it represents a collection of similar objects or events. You can distinguish table names from field names quite easily when you use this naming convention.  ❖ Note  The specific guideline for using a table name as a pre- fix for a field name will have the same issue that I brought up earlier for table names: These particular field names are likely to change once you  or the database developer in charge of imple- menting the database  begin implementing the database into a specific RDBMS application. The names will need to conform to the naming convention that developers commonly use for the RDBMS.  With these guidelines in mind, review each table and determine  whether you can make improvements to any of the field names. When  you’re finished, you’re ready to identify and resolve any problems with  the fields. Figure 7.12 shows revisions to the field names of the table  structures in Figure 7.11.  In Figure 7.12, “Classes” is shortened to “Cls,” “Subjects” is shortened  to “Subj,” “Instructors” is shortened to “Inst,” “Student” is shortened to  “Std,” and “Social Security Number” replaces “SSN.” Remember that  abbreviations can be very useful so long as they are meaningful and  understood by everyone in the organization. Using proper and appro- priate abbreviations will not detract from the meaning of the field  name.   206   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  ClsName  SubjDescription  InstSocial Security Number  StdSocial Security Number  Table Structures  Classes  Subjects  Instructors  ClsNumber  SubjName  InstName  SubjName  Category  InstAddress  InstName  Credits  Room Number  InstPhone  Date Hired  Pay Rate  Students  StdName  StdAddress  StdPhone  Figure 7.12  Revised field names  ❖ Note  Throughout the remainder of the chapter and the rest of the book, table names within the text appear in all capital letters  such as VENDORS  and field names within the text appear in small capital letters  such as VENDOR ID NUMBER .   Using an Ideal Field to Resolve Anomalies  Although you’ve carefully identified the fields on your Preliminary  Field List, you may have created a few fields that could prove problem- atic to the table structure. Poorly defined fields can cause duplicate  data and redundant data, and they can be difficult to use. You might  find it difficult to determine whether any of the fields in a table is going  to cause problems unless you know the warning signs. The best way  to identify potentially troublesome fields is to determine whether they  comply with the Elements of the Ideal Field. These elements constitute  a set of guidelines you can use to create sound field structures and to  spot poorly designed fields easily.   Refining the Fields   207  Elements of the Ideal Field   cid:129  It represents a distinct characteristic of the subject of the table. As you know, a table represents a specific subject, which can be an object or event. The ideal field represents a distinct characteristic of that object or event.   cid:129  It contains only a single value. A field that can potentially store two or more occurrences of the same value is known as a mul- tivalued field. A multivalued field causes data redundancy prob- lems  quite obviously  and is difficult to use when you try to edit, delete, or sort the data within it. The ideal field is free of these problems because it contains only a single value.   cid:129  It cannot be deconstructed into smaller components. A field that can potentially store two or more distinct items within a value is known as a multipart  or composite  field. Like the multival- ued field, this type of field causes problems when you try to edit, delete, or sort the data within it. These problems don’t occur with an ideal field because it represents a single, distinct character- istic of the subject of the table to which it belongs.  You’ll learn more about multivalued and multipart fields in just a moment.    cid:129  It does not contain a calculated or concatenated value. The val- ues of the fields in a table should be mutually independent; a particular field should not have to depend on the values of other fields for its own value. A calculated field, however, does depend on the values of other fields for its own value, and therein lies the problem. The calculated field’s value is not updated when the value of any field participating in the calculation changes. It then becomes the responsibility  and an undesirable burden  of the user or the database application program to update the calcu- lated field when this type of change takes place. This is precisely why you deal with calculated fields separately.   cid:129  It is unique within the entire database structure. The only dupli-  cate fields that appear in a properly designed database are those   208   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  that establish relationships between tables. If duplicate fields  other than these exist in a table, it is very likely that the table  will accumulate unnecessary redundant data and that the data  within the duplicate fields will inevitably become inconsistent.  ❖ Note  Remember that you’re dealing strictly with the logical database structure at this point. You might have cause to dupli- cate specific fields when you physically implement the database in an RDBMS program. During that process, however, you’re making a conscious decision to duplicate the fields and you’re prepared to deal with the consequences of that decision.   cid:129  It retains a majority of its properties when it appears in more than  one table. A field that establishes a relationship between two tables is a structural component of each table. A majority of the field’s properties remain constant in each occurrence of the field.  Chapter 9, “Field Specifications,” and Chapter 10 cover this mat- ter in greater detail.   Although you now know the specific elements of an ideal field, you’ll  still find it difficult in many instances to identify problematic fields  just by looking at their names. Figure 7.13 shows a table structure  that helps to illustrate this point. Take a moment and try to determine  whether each field complies with the Elements of the Ideal Field or  needs to be modified.  Each field on the list seems to conform to the Elements of the Ideal  Field. Examine the list carefully, however, and you’ll see that some  fields don’t really comply with the second and third elements. Three  fields have anomalies that will cause problems unless you resolve them:  INSTNAME, INSTADDRESS, and CATEGORIES TAUGHT. If you doubt this asser- tion, you can test it by “loading” the table with sample data. This will  quickly reveal anomalies, if any exist, and is the best way to confirm  whether a field complies with all of the Elements of the Ideal Field.

Then enter records  into the table by filling in each field with some sample data; be sure the  sample data represents the data you’re actually going to enter into the  database.

Figure 7.14  Testing a table with sample data   210   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  ❖ Note  As I mentioned in Chapter 3, I show only those fields that are most relevant to the discussion at hand and use <<other fields>> to represent fields that are inessential to the example.  Now you can easily identify which fields are going to be troublesome  unless they are resolved. As you can see, INSTNAME and INSTADDRESS are  both multipart fields, and CATEGORIES TAUGHT is a multivalued field. You  must resolve these fields before you can refine the table structure.  Resolving Multipart Fields  Working with a multipart field is difficult because its value contains  two or more distinct items. It’s hard to retrieve information from a mul- tipart field, and it’s hard to sort or group the records in the table by  the field’s value. The INSTADDRESS field in Figure 7.14 illustrates these  difficulties; you’d certainly have problems retrieving information for  the city of Seattle or sorting information by zip code.  You resolve a multipart field by identifying the distinct items within  the field’s value and treating each item as an individual field. Accom- plish this task by asking yourself a simple question: “What specific  items does this field’s value represent?” Once you’ve answered the  question and identified the items  as best you can , transform each  item into a new field.  In Figure 7.14, the value of the field INSTNAME represents two items: the  first name and the last name of an instructor. You resolve this field  by creating a new INSTFIRST NAME field and a new INSTLAST NAME field.  The value of INSTADDRESS represents four items: the street address,  city, state, and zip code of an instructor. You transform these items  into fields as well; they will appear in the table as INSTSTREET ADDRESS,  INSTCITY, INSTSTATE, and INSTZIPCODE. Figure 7.15 shows the newly revised  INSTRUCTORS table.

Some multipart fields are hard to recognize. Take a look at the INSTRU- MENTS table in Figure 7.16. At first glance, the table doesn’t seem to  contain multipart fields. When you examine the data in the table more  closely, however, you’ll see that INSTRUMENT ID is actually a multipart  field. This field’s value represents two distinct items: the category to  which the instrument belongs—AMP  amplifier , GUIT  guitar , MFX   multi-effects unit , SFX  single-effect unit —and the instrument’s  identification number. Clearly, you should deconstruct INSTRUMENT ID   GUIT = Category  “Guitar”  2201 = Identification Number  Instrument ID  Manufacturer  Instrument Description   >  Instruments  GUIT2201  MFX3349  AMP1001  AMP5590  SFX2227  AMP2766  Fender  Zoom  Marshall  Crate  Dunlop  Fender  Stratocaster  Player 2100 Multieffects  JCM 2000 Tube Super Lead  VC60 Pro Tube Amp  Cry Baby Wah-Wah  Twin Reverb Reissue  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......

Imagine how difficult it would be for you to update the field’s  value if the MFX category changed to MFU if you don’t do this. You  would have to write programming code to parse the value, test for the  existence of MFX, and then replace it with MFU if it existed within the  parsed value. It’s not so much that you can’t do this, but you would  definitely be working harder than necessary, and you shouldn’t have to  go through this at all if you have a properly designed database.  Resolving Multivalued Fields  As you know, a multivalued field can potentially store two or more  occurrences of the same value. Fortunately, you’ll recognize a mul- tivalued field when you see one. The field’s name is often plural and its  value almost invariably contains a number of commas, which serve to  separate the various occurrences that exist within the value itself.  Resolving multipart fields is not very hard at all, but resolving mul- tivalued fields can be a little more difficult and will take some work.  A multivalued field has the same fundamental set of problems as a  multipart field, as the CATEGORIES TAUGHT field in Figure 7.17 clearly   Commas separate the occurrences within this value.

DTP, SS, WP  WP, DB, OS  DB, SS  DTP, WP, PG   Refining the Fields   213  illustrates. For example, you’ll have difficultly retrieving information  for everyone who teaches a specific category  such as WP , you can’t  sort the data in any meaningful fashion, and, most important, you  don’t have room to enter more than four categories. What happens  when one or more instructors teach five categories? The only option  you’ll have is to make the field larger every time you need to enter more  values than it will currently allow.  So how would you resolve this multivalued field? Your first thought  may be to create a new field for each value, thus “flattening” the mul- tivalued field into several single-valued fields. Figure 7.18 shows what  will happen if you follow through with this idea.  Unfortunately, this is not much of an improvement at all. There are  three specific problems that arise from this type of structure.  1. Retrieving category information will be tedious at best. A user attempting to find all instructors who teach the WP category must be sure to search for this value within each of the category fields—there is no guarantee that WP is consistently stored in the same field. Failure to do so means that the user runs the risk of overlooking a qualified instructor.  2. There is no way for the RDBMS program to sort the category  data in a meaningful fashion.

This structure is inherently volatile. In its current state, the table  unnecessarily restricts the number of categories an instructor can teach; you must create additional category fields when you have instructors who teach more than three categories. Adding more category fields just compounds the first two problems.  Realizing that flattening the CATEGORIES TAUGHT field won’t solve your  problem, your next thought is to bring the field into compliance with  the second element of an ideal field and declare that it will contain  only a single value. Although this is a good impulse and a step in the  right direction, it will not resolve the matter completely because it will  introduce yet another problem: data redundancy. Figure 7.19 illus- trates what happens when you follow through with this particular  idea. Note that there is now a single value in the CATEGORIES TAUGHT field  for each record in the table.

This redundancy is obviously unacceptable, so  you’ll have to resolve this problem in some other manner.  You can avoid this situation entirely by using these steps to resolve a  multivalued field.  1. Remove the field from the table and use it as the basis for a new table. If necessary, rename the field in accordance with the field name guidelines that you learned earlier in this chapter.  2. Use a field  or set of fields  from the original table to relate the  original table to the new table; try to select fields that represent the subject of the table as closely as possible. The field s  you choose will appear in both tables.  You’ll learn more about relat- ing tables in Chapter 10.   3. Assign an appropriate name, type, and description to the new  table and add it to the Final Table List.  These steps form a generic procedure that you can use to resolve any  multivalued field you encounter in a table. Now, apply these steps to  the CATEGORIES TAUGHT field.  1. Remove the field from the INSTRUCTORS table and use it as the  basis of a new table. Because this will now be a single-valued field, rename the field CATEGORY TAUGHT.  2. Use INSTFIRST NAME and INSTLAST NAME as the connecting fields that will relate the INSTRUCTORS table to the new table, and add them to the structure of the new table.  3. Give the new table a proper name, compose a suitable descrip-  tion, and add the table to the Final Table List.  Indicate the table’s type as “Data.”  Here’s one possible name and description you might use for the new table:  Instructor Categories—the categories of software programs that  an instructor is qualified to teach. The information this table    216   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  provides allows us to make certain that there is an adequate  number of instructors for each software category.

You can easily retrieve information  for a particular instructor or category, and you can sort the records in  a meaningful manner. Also note that the INSTFIRST NAME and INSTLAST  NAME fields retain their names in the new table, making them compli- ant with the fifth element of an ideal field.   Refining the Fields   217  Although the new table contains redundant data, the redundancy is  acceptable because it is minimal. It’s a fact of life that a relational data- base will always contain some amount of redundant data. Your goal as  the database architect is to make certain that it has only an absolute  minimum amount of redundant data.  Figure 7.21 shows a version of the INSTRUCTORS table that contains  three multivalued fields.  CATEGORIES TAUGHT—This indicates the categories of classes that an  instructor can teach.

You then  notice one small, relatively obscure problem: There is a distinct one-to- one association between values in CATEGORIES TAUGHT and the values in  MAXIMUM LEVEL TAUGHT for any given record. You probably wouldn’t have  noticed this anomaly had you not carefully examined the sample data  within these fields. Don’t worry; you’ll still use the same procedure,  but with one minor modification.   218   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  You’ll occasionally encounter a situation such as this, where some  given field  whether single- or multivalued  depends on a particular  multivalued field. You can easily fix this problem by including the  dependent field in the structure of the new table you build to resolve  the multivalued field. Figure 7.22 shows the results of consolidating  this technique with the previous one to resolve CATEGORIES TAUGHT.  It  shows the resolution of LANGUAGES SPOKEN as well.   The redundancy in the new tables is acceptable because, once again,  it is minimal. In Chapter 10, you’ll learn how to reduce this type of  redundancy even further by relating the tables with primary keys and  foreign keys.

Your objective in this phase of the design process is to make sure that  you’ve assigned the appropriate fields to each table and that you’ve  properly defined each table’s structure. This process will also reveal  whether the tables have anomalies that you need to resolve.  A Word about Redundant Data and  Duplicate Fields  You’ve seen the term redundant data used quite often in this chapter.  Redundant data was characterized as being unacceptable in many  cases, but appropriate in others. In order for you to better understand  how to determine when redundant data is acceptable, a definition of  the term is in order.  Redundant data is a value that is repeated in a field as a result of the  field’s participation in relating two tables or as a result of some field or  table anomaly. In the first instance, the redundant data is appropriate;  by definition, a field used to relate one table to another will contain  redundant data.  You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 10.  Redun- dant data is entirely unacceptable in the second instance, however,  because it poses problems with data consistency and data integrity;  therefore, you should always strive to keep redundant data to an abso- lute minimum.  A duplicate field is a field that appears in two or more tables for any of  these reasons.   cid:129  It is used to relate a set of tables together.   cid:129  It indicates multiple occurrences of a particular type of value.   cid:129  There is a perceived need for supplemental information.   220   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  The only instance in which a duplicate field is necessary is when it  serves to establish a relationship between two tables; it provides the sole  means of associating records in the first table with records in the sec- ond table. Duplicate fields are unnecessary in all other cases, and you  should avoid them because they introduce needless, redundant data.  As you refine each table structure, you’ll assess whether to retain a  given duplicate field in the table. If the reason for its existence in the  table is valid, then you’ll keep it; otherwise, you’ll remove it. You’ll  learn how to deal effectively with both redundant data and unneces- sary duplicate fields in the following sections.  Using an Ideal Table to Refine Table Structures  Despite your efforts to refine the fields in a table, the table structure  itself may contain anomalies that can produce unnecessary redun- dant data and make it difficult to work with the data in the table. You  can identify a potentially problematic table structure by determining  whether it complies with the Elements of the Ideal Table. These ele- ments constitute a set of guidelines you can use to create sound table  structures and to spot poorly designed tables easily.  Elements of the Ideal Table   cid:129  It represents a single subject, which can be an object or event. Yes,  I know, I’ve said this a number of times already. The fact of the matter is that I can’t overemphasize this point. As long as you guarantee that each of your tables represents a single subject, you greatly reduce the risk of potential data integrity problems. This element validates the work you’ve done during the analysis and interview stages of the database design process, as well as the work you’ve just recently performed.   cid:129  It has a primary key. This is important for two reasons: A pri- mary key uniquely identifies each record within a table, and it   Refining the Table Structures   221  plays a key role  no pun intended  in establishing table relation- ships. Additionally, it has specific characteristics that help to  implement and enforce various levels of data integrity. If you fail  to assign a primary key to each table, you will eventually have  data integrity problems. Chapter 8, “Keys,” covers primary keys  in greater detail.   cid:129  It does not contain multipart or multivalued fields. Theoretically,  you should have resolved these issues when you refined the field structures. Nevertheless, it’s still a good idea to review the fields one last time to ensure that you’ve completely removed each and every one of them.   cid:129  It does not contain calculated fields. Although you might believe that your current table structures are free of calculated fields, you may have accidentally overlooked one or two calculated fields during the field refinement process. This is a good time to review the table structures once more and make certain you remove those calculated fields you may have missed.   cid:129  It does not contain unnecessary duplicate fields.  Note that this guideline does not apply to fields used to relate a set of tables together, such as those used in the example in Figure 7.22.  One of the hallmarks of a poorly designed table is the inclusion of duplicate fields from other tables. You might feel compelled to add duplicate fields to a table for one of two reasons: to provide refer- ence information or to indicate multiple occurrences of a partic- ular type of value. Duplicate fields such as these raise various difficulties when you work with the data or attempt to retrieve information from the table.   cid:129  It contains only an absolute minimum amount of redundant data.  Remember that a relational database will never be completely free of redundant data. But you can—and should—make certain that each table contains as little redundant data as possible.   222   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Resolving Unnecessary Duplicate Fields  Before you make final modifications to the table structures, you must  first remove all unnecessary duplicate fields from the database. You  can then refine the tables so that they comply with the Elements of the  Ideal Table.  Duplicate fields that serve to provide reference information  also  known as reference fields  are unnecessary and easy to resolve—you  just remove them from the table. Unfortunately, many people believe  that a table must contain every field that will appear in the reports  they generate from it, so they introduce into the table various duplicate  fields they deem are necessary. They assume that the table will then  be able to provide all the requisite information for their reports. But  they are mistaken, and their action is both unwise and undesirable.  Tables containing reference fields exhibit poor design and will have a  number of problems, many of which will become increasingly clear as  the database design process unfolds. Reference fields force the user or  database application program to ensure that the values in all occur- rences of the field are mutually consistent, a process that carries a  high risk of error. Figure 7.23 shows an example of a table containing  reference fields.  The MANPHONE and WEB SITE fields in the INSTRUMENTS table are  reference fields and, by definition, are actually unnecessary duplicate  fields. You certainly don’t need to include them in this table because  they’re already part of the MANUFACTURERS table structure; there- fore, you can remove them from the INSTRUMENTS table in order to  resolve the unnecessary duplication problem.  MANUFACTURER is not a  reference field because it currently relates the INSTRUMENTS table to  the MANUFACTURERS table.  You’ll learn in Chapter 12, “Views,” that  you can work with fields from the INSTRUMENTS table and the MAN- UFACTURERS table at the same time by combining them within a  view  virtual table . You can then use this view as the basis for compil- ing any reports you require.   These fields duplicate the MANPHONE and WEB SITE  fields in the MANUFACTURERS table.

For example, take a look at the  version of the STUDENTS table presented in Figure 7.24.

These duplicate fields represent three occurrences of the same type of value.  Figure 7.24  A simple example of a table containing unnecessary duplicate fields  INSTRUMENT 1, INSTRUMENT 2, and INSTRUMENT 3 are duplicate fields that  represent multiple occurrences of the same type of value. Their pur- pose in the table is to enable the music department to keep track of the  instruments checked out by a given student. Aside from the difficulties  these fields pose in retrieving information about a particular instru- ment, the fields also limit the number of instruments a student can  check out. What happens if several students want to check out more  than three instruments?  Does this type of field structure look strangely familiar? It should!  It’s similar to the one back in Figure 7.18. As you’ve probably already  guessed, it’s nothing more than a flattened multivalued field. Mind  you, the person who created this table probably didn’t have a multival- ued field in mind  and neither do most folks who create fields such as  these , but that is what it truly is.  You already know how to deal with these unnecessary duplicate fields  because you know how to resolve multivalued fields. You can easily fix    Refining the Table Structures   225  the STUDENTS table by first visualizing the INSTRUMENT 1, INSTRUMENT 2,  and INSTRUMENT 3 fields as a singular multivalued field, and then  resolving it as you would any multivalued field. Figure 7.25 illustrates  this process. The shaded version of the STUDENTS table shows how  you visualize the instrument fields as a singular multivalued field. You  then resolve the multivalued field by applying the three-step process  you learned earlier, which yields the revised STUDENTS table and  the new STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table. When you’re finished, you’ll  be able to enter any number of instruments for a particular student.  It will then be quite easy for you to retrieve information such as the  names of the students who have checked out a guitar, a list of the  instruments that are currently checked out by a particular student,  and the number of students who have checked out an electric piano.

In some instances, a table can contain two or more sets of duplicate  fields that represent multiple occurrences of the same type of value.  Figure 7.26 shows a slightly different version of the STUDENTS table  shown in Figure 7.24; this version contains two sets of duplicate fields.  You may be thinking at this very moment, “Why is he saying there  are two sets of duplicate fields when I clearly see three? ” Contrary to  what you may think, INSTRUMENT 1 CHECKOUT DATE 1, for example, does  not constitute a set of duplicate fields. Quite the opposite—INSTRUMENT  1 INSTRUMENT 2 INSTRUMENT 3 constitute the first set of duplicate fields,  and CHECKOUT DATE 1 CHECKOUT DATE 2 CHECKOUT DATE 3 constitute the  second set of duplicate fields.  You’ve probably realized that these two sets of duplicate fields are  actually two flattened multivalued fields and that you can resolve them  in the same manner as in the previous example. The only other issue  that you must be concerned with is the distinct one-to-one association  between an instrument and a checkout date. This won’t be a problem,  however, because you’ve dealt with this type of scenario before. If you  visualize one multivalued field called INSTRUMENTS and another called  CHECKOUT DATE, you’ll see that the overall table structure is quite simi- lar to the one in Figure 7.21.  In that figure, there’s a one-to-one asso- ciation between the CATEGORIES TAUGHT and MAXIMUM LEVEL TAUGHT fields.   Figure 7.27 illustrates how you can fix this table.

You then resolve the multivalued fields by applying the three-step pro- cess you learned earlier, yielding the revised STUDENTS table and the  new STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table.  Now that you’re familiar with the Elements of the Ideal Table, review  your table structures and refine them as necessary. When you’re in  doubt about a particular table, sketch its structure on a piece of paper  and load it with sample data. You’ll then be able to resolve the anoma- lies revealed by the data.   228   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Establishing Subset Tables  As you refine the structures of your tables, you may find that some  of the fields in a particular table do not always contain values. This  situation will not affect your ability to retrieve information from the  table, but it can indicate that the table might need further refinement.  Consider the structure of the INVENTORY table in Figure 7.28.  Item Description  Warranty Expiration Date  Table Structures  Inventory  Item Name  Model  Current Value  Publisher  Insured Value  Date Entered  Author  ISBN  Manufacturer  Category  Figure 7.28  Structure of an office inventory table  In this scenario, the table contains data about various items in a  person’s office, such as office furniture, office equipment  computers,  printers, and so forth , and books. It’s inevitable that the values of  several fields in many of the records will be blank. For example, a book  will not have a MANUFACTURER, MODEL, or WARRANTY EXPIRATION DATE, and  a printer will not have an AUTHOR, PUBLISHER, ISBN, or CATEGORY. This  doesn’t pose a problem from a physical viewpoint  limited hard-disk  space certainly isn’t the critical issue it was in years past , but it can  pose a perceptual problem. Users  and management, for that matter   get fairly nervous when they see a lot of blank values in a table. Is the  data missing? Did someone forget to make entries into these fields?    Refining the Table Structures   229  Has someone mistakenly deleted the data? Did the computer acciden- tally destroy the original values?  Yes, the urban myth, “The computer  did it!” still lives on.  The more important question is this: If you were  adhering to the Elements of the Ideal Table as you were creating this  table, how did you arrive at this particular structure?  Fortunately, this is just another type of structural anomaly that occa- sionally occurs as you design various tables. Your task now is to learn  how to deal with it in an appropriate manner.  The first step is to determine whether the INVENTORY table truly  complies with the first element of an ideal table  i.e., “It represents a  single subject” . A table that contains a large number of blank values  in its fields usually—but not always—represents more than one sub- ject. Think about the two sets of fields in question for a moment, and  you’ll soon realize that they represent characteristics of two distinct  aspects of the table’s subject. The first set of fields describes equipment  inventory, and the second set of fields describes books inventory; fur- thermore, both types of inventory share common characteristics, such  as ITEM NAME, ITEM DESCRIPTION, and CURRENT VALUE. In essence, “Equip- ment” and “Books” are subjects that are dependent upon the INVEN- TORY table for their very existence; neither describes a completely  distinct object or event. As a result, they are subordinate subjects, and  you’ll create a subset table for each of them.  Just as a data table represents a distinct subject, a subset table rep- resents a subordinate subject of a particular data table. The subset  table contains fields that are germane to the subordinate subject it  represents, and it also includes a field  or fields  from the data table  that serves to relate the data table to the subset table. It’s important  to note that a subset table does not contain fields that represent char- acteristics common to both it and the data table; these fields must  remain in the data table.   230   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Now that you’ve determined that the INVENTORY table describes three  subjects  it doesn’t matter that two of them are subordinate subjects ,  you must bring it into compliance with the first element of an ideal  table by removing the fields in question. You then use the fields as the  basis for two new subset tables, one for each subordinate subject. Here  are the steps you follow to accomplish these tasks.  1. Use the MANUFACTURER, MODEL, and WARRANTY EXPIRATION DATE  fields to create a new subset table called EQUIPMENT.  2. Use the PUBLISHER, AUTHOR, ISBN, and CATEGORY fields to create a  new subset table called BOOKS.  3. Add ITEM NAME to both tables; this field will relate each subset  table to the data table.  4. Compose a suitable description for both subset tables and  add them to the Final Table List. Indicate each table’s type as “Subset.”  Figure 7.29 shows the new subset table structures.  Table Structures  Inventory  Equipment  Item Name  Item Name  Item Description  Manufacturer  Current Value  Model  Insured Value  Warranty Expiration Date  ISBN  Date Entered  Books  Item Name  Publisher  Author  Category  Figure 7.29  The new subset table structures   Refining the Table Structures   231  Take a moment to review your table structures once more. You may  discover that you’ve created subset tables without knowing it. Tables  that have almost identical structures are commonly subset tables;  there are usually only a few unique fields that distinguish one table  from the other. For example, consider the two partial table structures  in Figure 7.30. Each table represents a distinct aspect of the same  subject.  Table Structures  Table Structures  Full-Time Employees  Part-Time Employees  FTEFirst Name  FTELast Name  FTEDate Hired  Salary Amount  Position  FTECity  FTEState  PTEFirst Name  PTELast Name  PTEDate Hired  Hourly Rate  Skill Level  PTECity  PTEState  FTEStreet Address  PTEStreet Address  Figure 7.30  Previously unidentified subset tables  Both of these tables represent employees, but each represents a specific  type of employee. Notice, however, that there are generic fields common  to both tables: first name, last name, date hired, street address, city,  and state. These fields are duplicated unnecessarily, so you’ll need to  refine the table structures to resolve this problem.  Refining Previously Unidentified Subset Tables  When you identify subset tables such as these, you can refine them  using these steps.   232   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  1. Remove all the fields that the subset tables have in common and  use them as the basis for a new data table.  2.  Identify what subject the new data table represents, and then give the table an appropriate name.  3. Make sure that the subset tables represent subordinate sub- jects of the data table and modify the subset table names as necessary.  4. Compose a suitable description for the data table and then add  it to the Final Table List. Indicate the table type as “Data.”  Figure 7.31 shows the results of using these steps on the FULL-TIME  EMPLOYEES and PART-TIME EMPLOYEES tables.  Table Structures  Employees  Full-Time Employees  Part-Time Employees  EmpFirst Name  EmpFirst Name  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  EmpLast Name  EmpLast Name  Date Hired  Salary Amount  Hourly Rate  EmpStreet Address  Position  Skill Level  EmpCity  EmpState  Figure 7.31  The results of refining the subset tables  At this point, all of your table structures should be in pretty good  shape. You will need to refine them even further, however, as you learn  about primary keys, foreign keys, relationships, and business rules.   Refining the Table Structures   233  CASE STUDY  You’re now going to define the Preliminary Table List for Mike’s Bikes.  As you know, the first thing you need to do is review the Preliminary  Field List to determine what subjects you can infer from the fields on  the list. Figure 7.32 shows a partial sample of that list.  Preliminary Field List  as of 02 16 12  Birth Date  Employee Name  Employee Address  Employee City  Customer Name  Office Phone  Product Name  Category  Unit Price  Invoice Number  Customer Address  Invoice Date  Figure 7.32  The Preliminary Field List for Mike’s Bikes  After carefully reviewing the entire Preliminary Field List, you deter- mine that the fields on the list suggest these subjects: customers,  employees, invoices, products, and vendors. You then compile these  items into the first version of your Preliminary Table List.  Now you create a second version of the list by merging the current  Preliminary Table List with the list of subjects you created during the  analysis process. Keep the following steps in mind as you merge the  two lists together.  1. Resolve items that are duplicated on both lists. Remember that a single item can appear on both lists yet represent different sub- jects. When you identify such items, use the appropriate tech- niques to resolve this problem.   234   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  2. Resolve items that represent the same subject but have different  names. You want to ensure that only one table represents a par- ticular subject.  3. Combine the remaining items together into one list. The combined  list becomes the second version of the Preliminary Table List.  After following these steps, your Preliminary Table List should look  similar to the one shown in Figure 7.33.  List of Subjects  Preliminary Table List  Customers  Employees Products  Sales Suppliers  Customers  Employees Invoices  Products Vendors  Figure 7.33  The second version of the Preliminary Table List  You cross out “Customers,” “Employees,” and “Products” on the list of  subjects because they represent the same subjects as their counter- parts on the Preliminary Table List. The SALES table has no coun- terpart on the Preliminary Table List, but it does represent the same  subject as “Invoices.” “Invoices” is most meaningful to Mike and his  staff, however, so you use it on the Preliminary Table List instead of  “Sales.” A similar situation exists between “Suppliers” and “Vendors”;  Mike selects “Vendors” as the name to appear on the Preliminary Table  List, so you cross out “Suppliers.”  ❖ Note  Selecting a name that best represents the subject of the table is an arbitrary task. A good rule to follow is to use the name that is most meaningful to everyone in the organization.   Refining the Table Structures   235  Now you’ll work toward the final version of the Preliminary Table List.  Use the mission objectives you created at the beginning of the data- base design process to determine whether there are subjects you may  have overlooked during the previous two procedures. Identify each  subject represented in the mission objectives using the Subject-Identifi- cation Technique. Once you’ve identified as many subjects as possible,  you can use the steps from the second procedure to cross-check these  subjects against the subjects currently listed on the Preliminary Table  List. When you’ve completed the review and have resolved any dupli- cate items, your final version of the Preliminary Table List is complete.  As it turns out, all of the subjects you’ve identified from the mission  objectives for Mike’s Bikes already appear on the Preliminary Table  List. This is good news because it allows you to complete your cross- check quite easily. Satisfied that you’ve completed the task thoroughly,  you now have the final version of the Preliminary Table List.  Now that the Preliminary Table List is complete, you’re ready to trans- form it into a Final Table List. Keep these steps in mind as you begin  this process.  1. Refine the table names. Use the appropriate guidelines to ensure  that each table name is clear, unambiguous, descriptive, and meaningful.  2. Compose a suitable description for each table. Make certain that  the table description explicitly defines the table and states its importance to the organization. Use the pertinent guidelines to create each table description.  3.  Indicate the table’s type. Remember that a table can be classified in one of four ways—data, linking, subset, or validation. At this point, all of your tables are data tables.  Figure 7.34 shows a partial example of the Final Table List for Mike’s  Bikes.   236   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  Name  Customers  Type  Data  Employees  Data  Final Table List  Description  The people who purchase the products we have to offer. Keeping track of our customers allows us to promote our business and obtain valuable feedback in assessing the quality of our customer service.  The people who work for our company in various capacities. This information is important for tax purposes, health benefits, and work-related issues.  Figure 7.34  A partial listing of the Final Table List for Mike’s Bikes  The next order of business is to associate fields from the Preliminary  Field List with each table in the Final Table List. Make certain you  select the fields that best represent characteristics of each table’s  subject; each field should define or describe a particular aspect of the  subject. Figure 7.35 shows a partial example of the table structures for  Mike’s Bikes.  Now you refine the fields. Remember to follow these steps as you work  with each field.  1.  Improve the field name. Use the appropriate guidelines to ensure that each field name is as clear, unambiguous, and descriptive as possible.  2. Determine whether the field complies with the Elements of the  Ideal Field. Make certain you check for multipart and multival- ued fields. As you learned earlier, they can cause a number of problems within a table.   Refining the Table Structures   237  Table Structures  Customers  Employees  Invoices  Products  Customer First Name  Employee Name  Invoice Number  Product Name  Customer Last Name  Employee Address  Invoice Date  Product Description  Customer Phone  Employee Phone  Employee Name  Category  Customer Address  SSN  Customer Last Name  Wholesale Price  Status  Date Hired  Position  Customer First Name  Retail Price  Customer Phone  Quantity  Figure 7.35  A partial listing of the table structures for Mike’s Bikes  As you review the fields, you decide to abbreviate some of the field  names in the CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, and INVOICES tables,  shortening CUSTOMER to CUST and EMPLOYEE to EMP. You also  decide that the field name QUANTITY  in the PRODUCTS table  does not  completely describe the characteristic it represents, so you change it to  QUANTITY ON HAND. The phone fields in the CUSTOMERS and EMPLOY- EES tables suffer the same problem, so you change them to CUSTHOME  PHONE and EMPHOME PHONE, respectively. Furthermore, you change  SSN to SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER so that the field name is absolutely  unambiguous.  Further investigation of the fields reveals that almost all of them  comply with the Elements of the Ideal Field. The only exceptions are  the address fields in the CUSTOMERS and EMPLOYEES tables, and  the EMPLOYEE NAME fields in the EMPLOYEES and INVOICES tables.  After ascertaining that you can decompose each address field into  four individual items—street address, city, state, and zip code—you  transform these items into fields and add them to the CUSTOMERS  and EMPLOYEES tables. Similarly, you notice that the EMPLOYEE NAME    238   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  field represents two items—first name and last name—and you make  the appropriate adjustments to that field in the EMPLOYEES and  INVOICES tables.   Figure 7.36 shows the result of all the changes you’ve made to the  fields.

Make certain that you  have assigned the appropriate fields to each table and that you have  properly defined each table. Remember to follow these steps as you  work with each table.  1. Resolve unnecessary duplicate fields. When you create new  tables as a result of resolving duplicate fields, make sure you properly identify them and add them to the Final Table List.  2. Determine whether each table complies with the Elements of the  Ideal Table. Make certain you resolve all the anomalies you identify in the fields or within the table structure as a whole.   Refining the Table Structures   239  3. Establish subset tables as appropriate. Make certain you prop- erly identify these tables and add them to the Final Table List as well.  As you complete your review of the tables, you determine that all of them  conform to the Elements of the Ideal Table with the exception of the  INVOICES table. The only problem with this table is that it contains an  unnecessary duplicate field: CUSTHOME PHONE. You can remove this field  from the table, however, because it provides only reference information.  As you work with the PRODUCTS table, you notice that there are fields  you might be able to remove and then use as the basis for a subset  table. So you review the table once again. Figure 7.37 shows the PROD- UCTS table structure you’re currently examining.  This is an expanded  version of the table structure shown in Figure 7.36.   Table Structures  Products  Product Name  Service Name  Product Description  Service Description  Category  Service Category  Wholesale Price  Service Type  Retail Price  Materials Charge  Quantity On Hand  Service Charge  Figure 7.37  The PRODUCTS table structure  expanded version   Your assumption proves correct. You determine that certain fields  describe a service, and you can construe a service as being a different  type of product. A service is similar to a product in that it has a name,  description, and category, but it is different inasmuch as it has a type,    240   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  materials charge, service charge, and service date. With this in mind,  you create a new subset table called SERVICES, make the appropriate  modifications to the PRODUCTS table, and use the PRODUCT NAME field  to relate the two tables to each other. You then add the suitable listing  for the SERVICES table to the Final Table List. Figure 7.38 shows the  revised PRODUCTS table and the new SERVICES subset table.  Table Structures  Products  Product Name  Product Description  Category  Wholesale Price  Retail Price  Quantity On Hand  Services  Product Name  Service Type  Materials Charge  Service Charge  Figure 7.38  The new PRODUCTS and SERVICES tables  Summary  We opened the chapter with a discussion of the Preliminary Table List.  This list constitutes the initial table structures for the new database.  You learned how to develop this list using the Preliminary Field List,  the list of subjects, and the mission objectives, all of which you com- piled during the analysis phase of the database design process.  Next we discussed the procedure for transforming the Preliminary  Table List into a Final Table List, which contains the name, type, and  description of each table in the database. You learned a set of guide- lines for creating table names, and another set of guidelines for com- posing table descriptions. We then worked on creating table names    Summary  241  that are unambiguous, descriptive, and meaningful and descriptions  that explicitly define tables, as well as stating their importance to the  organization. You also learned that enlisting the help of users and  management is crucial to the process of developing well-defined table  descriptions. Table descriptions must be suitable and easily under- stood by everyone in the organization.  We then discussed the process of associating fields with each table on  the Final Table List. Here you learned how to build a structure for a  given table using fields from the Preliminary Field List that best repre- sent characteristics of the table’s subject.  Refining fields was the next subject of discussion, and you learned a  set of guidelines for creating field names that will help you ensure that  they are clear, descriptive, and meaningful. You also learned about the  Elements of the Ideal Field. Now you know that you can resolve anom- alies in a field by determining whether it complies with these elements.  We then discussed how to resolve multipart and multivalued fields. You  learned that decomposing multipart fields yields new fields, whereas  decomposing multivalued fields yields new tables.  The chapter closed with a discussion of refining table structures. You  learned to identify the Elements of the Ideal Table, and you now know  that you can ferret out a problem in table structure by determining  whether a table complies with these elements. We then discussed  unnecessary duplicate fields, and you now know that they appear in a  table for one of two reasons: to supply reference information or to repre- sent different occurrences of the same type of value. You then learned  how to resolve duplicate fields to eliminate the problems they present.  The final discussion centered on the topic of subset tables. As you now  know, a subset table represents a subordinate subject of a particular  data table, and there is a distinct relationship between the subset table  and the data table. You also know that you can explicitly create sub- set tables. You then learned that you may have unknowingly created    242   Chapter 7  Establishing Table Structures  subset tables earlier in the database design process and that you need  to look for subset tables you have not previously identified. When you  identify a subset table, you refine it and add it to the Final Table List.  Review Questions  1. How do you identify and establish tables for a new database?  2. Why do you use the Preliminary Field List to help you define tables  for the database?  3.

Furthermore, you’ve put the structures through a screening process  to control their makeup and quality. In this next stage of the data- base design process, you’ll begin the task of assigning keys to each  table. You’ll soon learn that there are different types of keys, and each  plays a particular role within the database structure. All but one key  is assigned during this stage; you’ll assign the remaining key later   in Chapter 10, “Table Relationships”  as you establish relationships  between tables.  243   244  Chapter 8  Keys  Why Keys Are Important  Keys are crucial to a table structure for the following reasons.   cid:129  They ensure that each record in a table is precisely identified. As you already know, a table represents a singular collection of similar objects or events.  For example, a CLASSES table represents a collection of classes, not just a single class.  The complete set of records within the table constitutes the collec- tion, and each record represents a unique instance of the table’s subject within that collection. You must have some means of accurately identifying each instance, and a key is the device that allows you to do so.   cid:129  They help establish and enforce various types of integrity. Keys are  a major component of table-level integrity and relationship-level integrity. For instance, they enable you to ensure that a table has unique records and that the fields you use to establish a relation- ship between a pair of tables always contain matching values.   cid:129  They serve to establish table relationships. As you’ll learn in  Chapter 10, you’ll use keys to establish a relationship between a pair of tables.  Always make certain that you define the appropriate keys for each  table. Doing so will help you guarantee that the table structures are  sound, that redundant data within each table is minimal, and that the  relationships between tables are solid.  Establishing Keys for Each Table  Your next task is to establish keys for each table in the database.  There are four main types of keys: candidate, primary, foreign, and non- keys. A key’s type determines its function within the table.   Establishing Keys for Each Table   245  Candidate Keys  The first type of key you establish for a table is the candidate key,  which is a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies a single instance  of the table’s subject. Each table must have at least one candidate key.  You’ll eventually examine the table’s pool of available candidate keys  and designate one of them as the official primary key for the table.  Before you can designate a field as a candidate key, you must make cer- tain it complies with all of the Elements of a Candidate Key. These ele- ments constitute a set of guidelines you can use to determine whether  the field is fit to serve as a candidate key. You cannot designate a field  as a candidate key if it fails to conform to any of these elements.  Elements of a Candidate Key   cid:129  It cannot be a multipart field. You’ve seen the problems with   multipart fields, so you know that using one as an identifier is a bad idea.   cid:129  It must contain unique values. This element helps you guard  against duplicating a given record within the table. Duplicate records are just as bad as duplicate fields, and you must avoid them at all costs.   cid:129  It cannot contain null values. As you already know, a null value represents the absence of a value. There’s absolutely no way a candidate key field can identify a given record if its value is null.   cid:129  Its value cannot cause a breach of the organization’s security or   privacy rules. Values such as passwords and Social Security numbers are not suitable for use as a candidate key.   cid:129  Its value is not optional in whole or in part. A value that is optional  implies that it may be null at some point. You can infer, then, that an optional value automatically violates the previous ele- ment and is, therefore, unacceptable.  This caveat is especially   246  Chapter 8  Keys  applicable when you want to use two or more fields as a candi- date key.    cid:129  It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define  uniqueness. You can use a combination of fields  treated as a single unit  to serve as a candidate key, so long as each field contributes to defining a unique value. Try to use as few fields as possible, however, because overly complex candidate keys can ultimately prove to be difficult to work with and difficult to understand.   cid:129  Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record in  the table. This element helps you guard against duplicate records and ensures that you can accurately reference any of the table’s records from other tables in the database.   cid:129  Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field within a  given record. This element ensures that the table’s candidate keys provide the only means of identifying each field value within the record.  You’ll learn more about this particular element in the section on primary keys.    cid:129  Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases. You should  never change the value of a candidate key unless you have an absolute and compelling reason to do so. A field is likely to have difficulty conforming to the previous elements if you can change its value arbitrarily.  Establishing a candidate key for a table is quite simple: Look for a field  or set of fields that conforms to all of the Elements of a Candidate Key.  You’ll probably be able to define more than one candidate key for a  given table. Loading a table with sample data will give you the means  to identify potential candidate keys accurately.  You used this same  technique in the previous chapter.   See if you can identify any candidate keys for the table in Figure 8.1.

You probably identified EMPLOYEE ID, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, EMPLAST  NAME, EMPFIRST NAME and EMPLAST NAME, EMPZIPCODE, and EMPHOME PHONE  as potential candidate keys. But you’ll need to examine these fields more  closely to determine which ones are truly eligible to become candidate  keys. Remember that you must automatically disregard any field s  fail- ing to conform to even one of the Elements of a Candidate Key.  Upon close examination, you can draw the following conclusions.   cid:129  EMPLOYEE ID is eligible. This field conforms to every element of a  candidate key.   cid:129  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER is ineligible because it could contain null  values and will most likely compromise the organization’s privacy rules. Contrary to what the sample data shows, this field could contain a null value. For example, there are many people working in the United States who do not have Social Security numbers because they are citizens of other countries.  ❖ Note  Despite its wides pread use in many types of databases, I strongly recommend that you refrain from using SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER as a candidate key  or as a primary key, for that matter   continues   248  Chapter 8  Keys  in any of your database structures. In many instances, it doesn’t  conform to the Elements of a Candidate Key.  The Philadelphia Region section of the Social Security Online web  site provides some very interesting facts about Social Security  numbers and identify theft, which is yet another good reason why  you should avoid using SSNs as candidate primary keys. You can  access their site here: www.ssa.gov phila ProtectingSSNs.htm.   cid:129  EMPLAST NAME is ineligible because it can contain duplicate values. As you’ve learned, the values of a candidate key must be unique. In this case there can be more than one occurrence of a particu- lar last name.   cid:129  EMPFIRST NAME and EMPLAST NAME are eligible. The combined values  of both fields will supply a unique identifier for a given record. Although multiple occurrences of a particular first name or last name will occur, the combination of a given first name and last name will always be unique.  Some of you are probably saying, “This is not necessarily always true.” You’re absolutely right. Don’t worry; we’ll address this issue shortly.    cid:129  EMPZIPCODE is ineligible because it can contain duplicate values.  Many people live in the same zip code area, so the values in EMPZIPCODE cannot possibly be unique.   cid:129  EMPHOME PHONE is ineligible because it can contain duplicate values  and is subject to change. This field will contain duplicate values for either of these two reasons.  1. One or more family members work for the organization.  2. One or more people share a residence that contains a single  phone line.   Establishing Keys for Each Table   249  You can confidently state that the EMPLOYEES table has two can- didate keys: EMPLOYEE ID and the combination of EMPFIRST NAME and  EMPLAST NAME.  Mark candidate keys in your table structures by writing the letters  “CK” next to the name of each field you designate as a candidate key. A  candidate key composed of two or more fields is known as a composite  candidate key, and you’ll write “CCK” next to the names of the fields  that make up the key. When you have two or more composite candidate  keys, use a number within the mark to distinguish one from another.  If you had two composite candidate keys, for example, you would mark  one as “CCK1” and the other as “CCK2.”  Apply this technique to the candidate keys for the EMPLOYEES table  in Figure 8.1. Figure 8.2 shows how your structure should look when  you’ve completed this task.

Now try to identify as many candidate keys as you can for the PARTS  table in Figure 8.3.  At first glance, you may believe that PART NAME, MODEL NUMBER, the  combination of PART NAME and MODEL NUMBER, and the combination of  MANUFACTURER NAME and PART NAME are potential candidate keys. After  investigating this theory, however, you come up with the following  results.   cid:129  PART NAME is ineligible because it can contain duplicate values. A given part name will be duplicated when the part is manufac- tured in several models. For example, this is the case with Faust Brake Levers.   cid:129  MODEL NUMBER is ineligible because it can contain null values. A  candidate key value must exist for each record in the table. As you can see, some parts do not have a model number.   cid:129  PART NAME and MODEL NUMBER are ineligible because either field can contain null values. The simple fact that MODEL NUMBER can con- tain null values instantly disqualifies this combination of fields.   cid:129  MANUFACTURER NAME and PART NAME are ineligible because the values  for these fields seem to be optional. Recall that a candidate key   Establishing Keys for Each Table   251  value cannot be optional in whole or in part. In this instance,  you can infer that entering the manufacturer name is optional  when it appears as a component of the part name; therefore, you  cannot designate this combination of fields as a candidate key.  It’s evident that you don’t have a single field or set of fields that quali- fies as a candidate key for the PARTS table. This is a problem because  each table must have at least one candidate key. Fortunately, there is a  solution.  Artificial Candidate Keys  When you determine that a table does not contain a candidate key,  you can create and use an artificial  or surrogate  candidate key.  It’s  artificial in the sense that it didn’t occur “naturally” in the table; you  have to manufacture it.  You establish an artificial candidate key by  creating a new field that conforms to all of the Elements of a Candi- date Key and then adding it to the table; this field becomes the official  candidate key.  You can now solve the problem in the PARTS table. Create an artificial  candidate key called PART NUMBER and assign it to the table.  The new  field will automatically conform to the Elements of a Candidate Key  because you’re creating it from scratch.  Figure 8.4 shows the revised  structure of the PARTS table.  When you’ve established an artificial candidate key for a table, mark  the field name with a “CK” in the table structure, just as you did for  the EMPLOYEES table in the previous example.  You may also choose to create an artificial candidate key when it  would be a stronger  and thus, more appropriate  candidate key than  any of the existing candidate keys. Assume you’re working on an  EMPLOYEES table and you determine that the only available candi- date key is the combination of the EMPFIRST NAME and EMPLAST NAME    252  Chapter 8  Keys  Parts  41000 41001 41002 41003 41004 41005 41006  Part Number  Part Name  Model Number  Manufacturer Name  Retail Price  Shimka XT Cranks Faust Brake Levers MiniMite Pump Hobo Fanny Pack Diablo Bike Pedals Shimka Truing Stand Faust Brake Levers  XT-113 BL   45  Mtn-A26 SP-100 BL   60  Shimka Incorporated Faust USA MiniMite Hobo Bike Company Diablo Sports  Faust USA  199.95 53.79 35.00 59.00 129.50 37.95 79.95  Figure 8.4  The PARTS table with the artificial candidate key PART NUMBER  fields. Although this may be a valid candidate key, using a single-field  candidate key might prove more efficient and may identify the subject  of the table more easily. Let’s say that everyone in the organization  is accustomed to using a unique identification number rather than a  name as a means of identifying an employee. In this instance, you can  choose to create a new field named EMPLOYEE ID and use it as an arti- ficial candidate key. This is an absolutely acceptable practice—do this  without hesitation or reservation if you believe it’s appropriate.  ❖ Note  I commonly create an ID field  such as EMPLOYEE ID, VEN- DOR ID, DEPARTMENT ID, CATEGORY ID, and so on  and use it as an artificial candidate key. It always conforms to the Elements of a Candidate Key, makes a great primary key  eventually , and, as you’ll see in Chapter 10, makes the process of establishing table relationships much easier.  Review the candidate keys you’ve selected and make absolutely certain  that they thoroughly comply with the Elements of a Candidate Key.  Don’t be surprised if you discover that one of them is not a candidate  key after all—incorrectly identifying a field as a candidate key happens    Establishing Keys for Each Table   253  occasionally. When this does occur, just remove the “CK” designator  from the field name in the table structure. Deleting a candidate key  won’t pose a problem so long as the table has more than one candidate  key. If you discover, however, that the only candidate key you identi- fied for the table is not a candidate key, you must establish an artificial  candidate key for the table. After you’ve defined the new candidate key,  remember to mark its name with a “CK” in the table structure.  Primary Keys  By now, you’ve established all the candidate keys that seem appropri- ate for every table. Your next task is to establish a primary key for each  table, which is the most important key of all.   cid:129  A primary key field exclusively identifies the table throughout the  database structure and helps establish relationships with other tables.  You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 10.    cid:129  A primary key value uniquely identifies a given record within a table and exclusively represents that record throughout the entire database. It also helps to guard against duplicate records.  A primary key must conform to the exact same elements as a candi- date key. This requirement is easy to fulfill because you select a pri- mary key from a table’s pool of available candidate keys. The process  of selecting a primary key is somewhat similar to that of a presidential  election. Every four years, several people run for the office of President  of the United States. These individuals are known as “candidates”  and they have all of the qualifications required to become president. A  national election is held, and a single individual from the pool of avail- able presidential candidates is elected to serve as the country’s official  president. Similarly, you identify each qualified candidate key in the  table, run your own election, and select one of them to become the offi- cial primary key of the table. You’ve already identified the candidates,  so now it’s election time!   254  Chapter 8  Keys  Assuming that there is no other marginal preference, here are a couple  of guidelines you can use to select an appropriate primary key.  1.  If you have a simple  single-field  candidate key and a composite candidate key, choose the simple candidate key. It’s always best to use a candidate key that contains the least number of fields.  2. Choose a candidate key that incorporates part of the table name within its own name. For example, a candidate key with a name such as SALES INVOICE NUMBER is a good choice for the SALES INVOICES table.  Examine the candidate keys and choose one to serve as the primary  key for the table. The choice is largely arbitrary—you can choose the  one that you believe most accurately identifies the table’s subject or the  one that is the most meaningful to everyone in the organization. For  example, consider the EMPLOYEES table again in Figure 8.5.  Table Structures  Employees  Employee ID  Social Security Number  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  EmpStreet Address  EmpCity  EmpState  EmpZipcode  EmpHome Phone  CK  CCK  CCK  Figure 8.5  Which candidate key should become the primary key of the   EMPLOYEES table?   Establishing Keys for Each Table   255  Either of the candidate keys you identified within the table could serve  as the primary key. You might decide to choose EMPLOYEE ID if everyone  in the organization is accustomed to using this number as a means of  identifying employees in items such as tax forms and employee bene- fits programs. The candidate key you ultimately choose becomes the  primary key of the table and is governed by the Elements of a Primary  Key. These elements are exactly the same as those for the candidate  key, and you should enforce them to the letter. For the sake of clarity,  here are the Elements of a Primary Key:  Elements of a Primary Key   cid:129  It cannot be a multipart field.   cid:129  It must contain unique values.   cid:129  It cannot contain null values.   cid:129  Its value cannot cause a breach of the organization’s security or   cid:129  Its value is not optional in whole or in part.   cid:129  It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define   cid:129  Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record in   cid:129  Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field within a  privacy rules.  uniqueness.  the table.  given record.   cid:129  Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases.  Before you finalize your selection of a primary key, it is imperative that  you make absolutely certain that the primary key fully complies with  this particular element:  Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field within a  given record.   256  Chapter 8  Keys  Each field value in a given record should be unique throughout the  entire database  unless it is participating in establishing a relationship  between a pair of tables  and should have only one exclusive means of  identification—the specific primary key value for that record.  You can determine whether a primary key fully complies with this ele- ment by following these steps.  1. Load the table with sample data.  2. Select a record for test purposes and note the current primary  key value.  3. Examine the value of the first field  the one immediately after  the primary key  and ask yourself this question:  Does this primary key value exclusively identify the current value of  ?  a. If the answer is yes, move to the next field and repeat the  question.  b. If the answer is no, remove the field from the table, move to the  next field, and repeat the question.  4. Continue this procedure until you’ve examined every field value  in the record.  A field value that the primary key does not exclusively identify indi- cates that the field itself is unnecessary to the table’s structure; there- fore, you should remove the field and reconfirm that the table complies  with the Elements of the Ideal Table. You can then add the field you  just removed to another table structure, if appropriate, or you can dis- card it completely because it is truly unnecessary.  Here’s an example of how you might apply this technique to the partial  table structure in Figure 8.6.  Note that INVOICE NUMBER is the primary  key of the table.    Establishing Keys for Each Table   257  Sales Invoices  Invoice Number  Invoice Date  CustFirst Name  CustLast Name  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  EmpHome Phone  13000  13001  13002  13003  13004  13005  06 15 02  06 15 02  06 15 02  06 16 02  06 16 02  06 17 02  Frank  Gregory  Carmen  David  Carmen  Frank  DeSoto  Mattson  Aguilar  Aguilar  DeSoto  Cunningham  Estela  Katherine  Kira  Kira  Shannon  Estela  Rosales  Erlich  Bently  Bently  Black  Rosales  363-9948  322-6992  527-4992  336-5992  572-9948  322-6992  Figure 8.6  Does the primary key exclusively identify the value of each field in  this table?  First, you load the table with sample data. You then select a record for  test purposes—we’ll use the third record for this example—and note  the value of the primary key  13002 . Now, pose the following question  for each field value in the record.  Does this primary key value exclusively identify the current  value of . . .  INVOICE DATE?   Yes, it does. This invoice number will always  identify the specific date that the invoice was  created.  CUSTFIRST NAME?  Yes, it does. This invoice number will always   CUSTLAST NAME?   EMPFIRST NAME?   identify the specific first name of the particular  customer who made this purchase.  Yes, it does. This invoice number will always  identify the specific last name of the particular  customer who made this purchase.  Yes, it does. This invoice number will always  identify the specific first name of the particular  employee who served the customer for this sale.   258  Chapter 8  Keys  EMPLAST NAME?   Yes, it does. This invoice number will always  identify the specific last name of the particular  employee who served the customer for this sale.  EMPHOME PHONE?  No, it doesn’t! The invoice number indirectly   identifies the employee’s home phone number  via the employee’s name. In fact, it is the current  value of both EMPFIRST NAME and EMPLAST NAME  that exclusively identifies the value of EMPHOME  PHONE—change the employee’s name and you  must change the phone number as well. You  should now remove EMPHOME PHONE from the  table for two reasons: The primary key does  not exclusively identify its current value and   as you’ve probably already ascertained  it is an  unnecessary field. As it turns out, you can dis- card this field completely because it is already  part of the EMPLOYEES table structure.  After you’ve removed the unnecessary fields you identified during this  test, examine the revised table structure and make sure it complies  with the Elements of the Ideal Table.  The primary key should now exclusively identify the values of the  remaining fields in the table. This means that the primary key is truly  sound and you can designate it as the official primary key for the  table. Remove the “CK” next to the field name in the table structure  and replace it with a “PK.”  A primary key composed of two or more  fields is known as a composite primary key, and you mark it with the  letters “CPK.”  Figure 8.7 shows the revised structure of the SALES  INVOICES table with INVOICE NUMBER as its primary key.  As you create a primary key for each table in the database, keep these  two rules in mind:   Establishing Keys for Each Table   259  Table Structures  PK  Sales Invoices  Invoice Number  Invoice Date  CustFirst Name  CustLast Name  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  Ship Date  Shipper Name  Figure 8.7  The revised SALES INVOICES table with its new primary key  Rules for Establishing a Primary Key  1. Each table must have one—and only one—primary key. Because the primary key must conform to each of the elements that gov- ern it, only one primary key is necessary for a particular table.  2. Each primary key within the database must be unique—no two tables should have the same primary key unless one of them is a subset table. You learned at the beginning of this section that the primary key exclusively identifies a table throughout the database structure; therefore, each table must have its own unique primary key in order to avoid any possible confusion or ambiguity concerning the table’s identity. A subset table is excluded from this rule because it represents a more specific version of a particular data table’s subject—both tables must share the same primary key.  Later in the database design process, you’ll learn how to use the pri- mary key to help establish a relationship between a pair of tables.   260  Chapter 8  Keys  Alternate Keys  Now that you’ve selected a candidate key to serve as the primary key  for a particular table, you’ll designate the remaining candidate keys as  alternate keys. These keys can be useful to you in an RDBMS program  because they provide an alternative means of uniquely identifying a par- ticular record within the table. If you choose to use an alternate key in  this manner, mark its name with “AK” or “CAK”  composite alternate key   in the table structure; otherwise, remove its designation as an alternate  key and simply return it to the status of a normal field. You won’t be  concerned with alternate keys for the remainder of the database design  process, but you will work with them once again as you implement the  database in an RDBMS program.  Implementing and using alternate  keys in RDBMS programs is beyond the scope of this work—our only  objective here is to designate them as appropriate. This is in line with the  focus of the book, which is the logical design of a database.   Figure 8.8 shows the final structure for the EMPLOYEES table with the  proper designation for both the primary key and the alternate keys.

Its sole purpose is to represent a characteristic  of the table’s subject, and its value is determined by the primary key.  There is no particular designation for a non-key, so you don’t need to  mark it in the table structure.  Table-Level Integrity  This type of integrity is a major component of overall data integrity,  and it ensures the following.   cid:129  There are no duplicate records in a table.   cid:129  The primary key exclusively identifies each record in a table.   cid:129  Every primary key value is unique.   cid:129  Primary key values are not null.  You began establishing table-level integrity when you defined a pri- mary key for each table and ensured its enforcement by making abso- lutely certain that each primary key fully complied with the Elements  of a Primary Key. In the next chapter, you’ll enhance the table’s integ- rity further as you establish field specifications for each field within  the table.  Reviewing the Initial Table Structures  Now that the fundamental table definitions are complete, you need to  conduct interviews with users and management to review the work  you’ve done so far. This set of interviews is fairly straightforward and  should be relatively easy to conduct.   262  Chapter 8  Keys  During these interviews, you will accomplish these tasks.   cid:129  Ensure that the appropriate subjects are represented in the data- base. Although it’s highly unlikely that an important subject is missing at this stage of the database design process, it can hap- pen. When it does happen, identify the subject, use the proper techniques to transform it into a table, and develop it to the same degree as the other tables in the database.   cid:129  Make certain that the table names and table descriptions are  suitable and meaningful to everyone. When a name or descrip- tion appears to be confusing or ambiguous to several people in the organization, work with them to clarify the item as much as possible. It’s common for some table names and descriptions to improve during the interview process.   cid:129  Make certain that the field names are suitable and meaningful to everyone. Selecting field names typically generates a great deal of discussion, especially when there is an existing database in place. You’ll commonly find people who customarily refer to a particular field by a certain name because “that’s what it’s called on my screen.” When you change a field name—you have good reasons for doing so—you must diplomatically explain to these folks that you renamed the field so that it conforms to the stan- dards imposed by the new database. You can also tell them that the field can appear with the more familiar name once the data- base is implemented in an RDBMS program. What you’ve said is true; many RDBMSs allow you to use one name for the field’s physical definition and another name for display purposes. This feature, however, does not change, reduce, or negate the need for you to follow the guidelines for creating field names that you learned in Chapter 7, “Establishing Table Structures.”   cid:129  Verify that all the appropriate fields are assigned to each table.  This is your best opportunity to make certain that all of the nec- essary characteristics pertaining to the subject of the table are   Reviewing the Initial Table Structures   263  in place. You’ll commonly discover that you accidentally over- looked one or two characteristics earlier in the design process.  When this happens, identify the characteristics, use the appro- priate techniques to transform them into fields, and follow all the  necessary steps to add them to the table.  When you’ve completed the interviews, you’ll move to the next phase of  the database design process and establish field specifications for every  field in the database.  CASE STUDY  It’s now time to establish keys for each table in the Mike’s Bikes  database. As you know, your first order of business is to establish  candidate keys for each table. Let’s say you decide to start with the  CUSTOMERS table in Figure 8.9.  As you review each field, you try to determine whether it conforms to  the Elements of a Candidate Key. You determine that STATUS, CUSTHOME   Table Structures  Customers  CustFirst Name  CustLast Name  CustStreet Address  CustCity  CustState  CustZipcode  CustHome Phone  Status  Figure 8.9  The CUSTOMERS table structure in the Mike’s Bikes database   264  Chapter 8  Keys  PHONE, and the combination of CUSTFIRST NAME and CUSTLAST NAME are  potential candidate keys, but you’re not quite certain whether any of  them will completely conform to all of the elements. So you decide to  test the keys by loading the table with sample data as shown in  Figure 8.10.  Customers  Bridget  Phillip  Kel  Barbara  Daniel  Daniel  Sandi  Berlin  Bradley  Brigan  Chavez  Chavez  Cooper  CustFirst Name  CustLast Name  CustStreet Address  CustCity  CustState  CustZipcode  CustHome Phone  Status  Carmichael  7525 Taxco Lane  Redmond  2121 NE 35th  Bellevue  101 9th Avenue  Kent  7525 Taxco Lane  Redmond  750 Pike Street  301 N Main  115 Pine Place  Bothell  Seattle  Seattle  WA  WA  WA  WA  WA  WA  WA  98004  98126  98225  98225  98001  98115  98026  422-4982  Valued  363-9360  Valued  322-1178  363-9360  441-3987  365-7199  Preferred  Valued  332-0499  Preferred  Figure 8.10  Testing candidate keys in the CUSTOMERS table  Always remember that a field must comply with all of the Elements of a  Candidate Key in order to qualify as a candidate key. You must imme- diately disqualify the field if it does not fulfill this requirement.  As you examine the table, you draw these conclusions.   cid:129  STATUS is ineligible because it will probably contain duplicate val-  ues. As business grows, Mike is going to have many “Valued” customers.   cid:129  CUSTHOME PHONE is ineligible because it will probably contain dupli- cate values. The sample data reveals that two customers can live in the same residence and have the same phone number.   cid:129  CUSTFIRST NAME and CUSTLAST NAME are ineligible because they will probably contain duplicate values. The sample data reveals that the combination of first name and last name can represent more than one distinct customer.   Reviewing the Initial Table Structures   265  These findings convince you to establish an artificial candidate key for  this table. You then create a field called CUSTOMER ID, confirm that it  complies with the requirements for a candidate key, and add the new  field to the table structure with the appropriate designation.  Figure 8.11 shows the revised structure of the CUSTOMERS table.  Table Structures  CK  Customers  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address CustCity CustState CustZipcode CustHome Phone Status  Figure 8.11  The CUSTOMERS table with the new artificial candidate key,   CUSTOMER ID  Now you’ll repeat this procedure for each table in the database.  Remember to make certain that every table has at least one candidate  key.  The next order of business is to establish a primary key for each table.  As you know, you select the primary key for a particular table from the  table’s pool of available candidate keys. Here are a few points to keep  in mind when you’re choosing a primary key for a table with more than  one candidate key.   cid:129  Choose a simple  single-field  candidate key over a composite  candidate key.   266  Chapter 8  Keys   cid:129  If possible, pick a candidate key that has the table name incorpo-  rated into its own name.   cid:129  Select the candidate key that best identifies the subject of the  table or is most meaningful to everyone in the organization.  You begin by working with the EMPLOYEES table in Figure 8.12. As  you review the candidate keys, you decide that EMPLOYEE NUMBER is a  much better choice for a primary key than the combination of EMPFIRST  NAME and EMPLAST NAME because Mike’s employees are already accus- tomed to identifying themselves by their assigned numbers. Using  EMPLOYEE NUMBER makes perfect sense, so you select it as the primary  key for the table.

So you test EMPLOYEE NUMBER by following these steps.   Reviewing the Initial Table Structures   267  1. Load the EMPLOYEES table with sample data.  2. Select a record for test purposes and note the current value of  EMPLOYEE NUMBER.  3. Examine the value of the first field  the one immediately after  EMPLOYEE NUMBER  and ask yourself this question:  Does this primary key value exclusively identify the current value of  ?  a. If the answer is yes, move to the next field and repeat the  question.  b. If the answer is no, remove the field from the table, move to  the next field, and repeat the question.  Be sure to determine whether you can add the field you just removed to another table structure, if appropriate, or discard it completely because it is truly unnecessary.   4. Continue this procedure until you’ve examined every field value  in the record.  You know that you’ll have to remove any field containing a value that  EMPLOYEE NUMBER does not exclusively identify. EMPLOYEE NUMBER does  exclusively identify the value of each field in the test record, however,  so you use it as the official primary key for the EMPLOYEES table and  mark its name with the letters “PK” in the table structure. You then  repeat this process with the rest of the tables in Mike’s new database  until every table has a primary key.  Remember to keep these rules in mind as you establish primary keys  for each table.   cid:129  Each table must have one—and only one—primary key.   cid:129  Each primary key within the database should be unique—no two tables should have the same primary key  unless one of them is a subset table .   268  Chapter 8  Keys  As you work through the tables in Mike’s database, you remember that  the SERVICES table is a subset table. You created it during the previ- ous stage of the design process  in Chapter 7 , and it represents a more  specific version of the subject represented by the PRODUCTS table. The  PRODUCT NAME field is what currently relates the PRODUCTS table to the  SERVICES subset table. You now know, however, that a subset table  must have the same primary key as the table to which it is related, so  you’ll use PRODUCT NUMBER  the primary key of the PRODUCTS table   as the primary key of the SERVICES table. Figure 8.13 shows the   PRODUCTS and SERVICES tables with their primary keys.  Table Structures  Products  Services  Product Number  PK  Product Number  PK  Product Name  Product Description  Category  Wholesale Price  Retail Price  Quantity On Hand  Service Type  Materials Charge  Service Charge  Service Date  Figure 8.13  Establishing the primary key for the SERVICES subset table  The last order of business is to conduct interviews with Mike and his  staff and review all the work you’ve performed on the tables in the  database. As you conduct these interviews, make certain you check  the following.   cid:129  The appropriate subjects are represented in the database.   cid:129  The table names and descriptions are suitable and meaningful to  everyone.   Summary  269   cid:129  The field names are suitable and meaningful to everyone.   cid:129  All the appropriate fields are assigned to each table.  By the end of the interview, everyone agrees that the tables are in  good form and that all the subjects with which they are concerned are  represented in the database. Only one minor point came up during the  discussions: Mike wants to add a CALL PRIORITY field to the VENDORS  table. There are instances in which more than one vendor supplies a  particular product, and Mike wants to create a way to indicate which  vendor he should call first if that product is unexpectedly out of stock.  So you add the new field to the VENDORS table and bring the inter- view to a close.  Summary  The chapter opened with a discussion of the importance of keys. You  learned that there are different types of keys, and each type plays a  different role within the database. Each key performs a particular  function, such as uniquely identifying records, establishing various  types of integrity, and establishing relationships between tables. You  now know that you can guarantee sound table structure by making  certain that the appropriate keys are established for each table.  We then discussed the process of establishing keys for each table. We  began by identifying the four main types of keys: candidate, primary,  foreign, and non-keys. First, we looked at the process of establishing  candidate keys for each table. You learned about the Elements of a  Candidate Key and how to make certain that a field  or set of fields   complies with these elements. Then you learned that you can create  and use an artificial candidate key when none of the fields in a table  can serve as a candidate key or when a new field would make a stron- ger candidate key than any of the existing candidate key fields.   270  Chapter 8  Keys  The chapter continued with a discussion of primary keys. You learned  that you select a primary key from a table’s pool of candidate keys and  that the primary key is governed by a set of specific elements. We then  covered a set of guidelines that help you determine which candidate  key to use as a primary key. Next, you learned how to ensure that the  chosen primary key exclusively identifies a given record and its set of  field values. When the primary key does not exclusively identify a par- ticular field value, you know that you must remove the field from the  table in order to ensure the table’s structural integrity. You also know  that each table must have a single, unique primary key.  You then learned that you designate any remaining candidate keys  as alternate keys. These keys will be most useful to you when you  implement the database in an RDBMS program because they provide  an alternate means of identifying a given record. We then discussed  the non-key field, which is any field not designated as a candidate,  primary, alternate, or foreign key. You now know that a non-key field  represents a characteristic of the table’s subject and that the primary  key exclusively identifies its value.   Table-level integrity was the next subject of discussion, and you learned  that it is established through the use of primary keys and enforced by  the Elements of a Primary Key.  The chapter closed with some guidance on conducting further inter- views with users and management. You now know that these inter- views provide you with a means of reviewing the work you have  performed on the tables and help you to verify and validate the current  database structure.

They represent characteristics  of the subjects that are important to an organization. Fields store the  data that the organization uses as the basis of information—informa- tion that is vital to its daily operations, success, and future growth.  Despite their inherent value, fields are still the most overlooked,  underutilized, and neglected assets of the organization! Frequently,  little or no time is spent ensuring the structural and logical integrity of  the fields in the database.  Much is said and written about data integrity, but little is done  about it. Many people believe that keeping an eye on their data entry   273   274   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  personnel and having a “foolproof” user interface for the database  will greatly minimize potential data-related problems. This superficial  approach to data integrity commonly stems from an incorrect belief  that proper data integrity takes too much time to establish. It’s import- ant to note, however, that the people who don’t have time to estab- lish data integrity usually spend a large amount of time fixing their  improperly designed databases—typically spending up to three times  as long as it would have taken them to design the database properly in  the first place!  In this chapter, you’ll learn how to establish data integrity by defin- ing field specifications for each field in the database. First, you’ll learn  about the three sets of elements that compose a field specification;  then you’ll learn how to conduct interviews with users and manage- ment to enlist their help in defining the specifications for the fields.  Why Field Specifications Are Important  Despite what you may have heard, the time it takes to establish field  specifications for each field in the database is an investment toward  building consistent data and quality information—you are not wasting  time whatsoever by performing this process. In fact, you’ll waste more  time in the end if you only partially perform this process or neglect it  entirely. Shirking this duty means you’re bound to encounter  and suf- fer from  inconsistent and erroneous data and inaccurate information.  There are several reasons why field specifications are crucial.   cid:129  Field specifications help establish and enforce field-level integrity. Implementing these specifications enables you to guarantee that the data in each field is consistent and valid.   cid:129  Defining field specifications for each field enhances overall  data integrity. Remember that field-level integrity is one of the four components of overall data integrity. Field-level integrity   Field-Level Integrity  275  enhances  to some extent  the table-level integrity you estab- lished in the previous stage of the design process.  This will  become apparent when you work with the logical elements of the  field specification.    cid:129  Defining field specifications compels you to acquire a complete  understanding of the nature and purpose of the data in the data- base. Understanding the data means that you can judge whether the data is truly necessary and important to the organization, and you can learn how to use it to your best advantage.   cid:129  Field specifications constitute the “data dictionary” of the data-  base. Each field specification stores data on the characteristics of a particular field within the database. The complete set of specifications you establish for all of the fields in the database composes a literal dictionary of the database’s structure. This data dictionary is particularly useful when you implement your database in an RDBMS—you can use it as a guide for creating the fields and setting their fundamental properties. These spec- ifications will also help you determine what type of data entry and data validation procedures you need to implement within any user interface application you create for the database.  Keep in mind that the levels of consistency, quality, and accuracy of  the data in the database  and information retrieved from that data  are  in direct proportion to the degree to which you complete these spec- ifications. It is paramount that you establish each field specification  completely if your organization depends heavily on the information you  retrieve from the database.  Field-Level Integrity  A field attains field-level integrity after you’ve defined a complete set  of field specifications for the field. Field-level integrity warrants the  following.   276   Chapter 9  Field Specifications   cid:129  The identity and purpose of a field is clear, and all of the tables  in which it appears are properly identified.   cid:129  Field definitions are consistent throughout the database.   cid:129  The values of a field are consistent and valid.   cid:129  The types of modifications, comparisons, and operations that can be applied to the values in the field are clearly identified.  You can guarantee that a field structure is sound and optimally  designed when it has a complete set of field specifications and fully  conforms to the Elements of the Ideal Field. In fact, ensuring that the  field complies with the Elements of the Ideal Field makes defining a set  of specifications a relatively easy task.  If you’ve had any lingering doubt about a particular field’s confor- mance to the Elements of the Ideal Field, now is a good time to review  that field once more. If you determine that it is not in conformance,  use the appropriate techniques to resolve the problem and make the  proper adjustments to the table; otherwise, you can begin the process  of defining field specifications for each field in the database. Here are  the Elements of the Ideal Field once again for your convenience.   cid:129  It represents a distinct characteristic of the subject of the table.   cid:129  It contains only a single value.   cid:129  It cannot be deconstructed into smaller components.   cid:129  It does not contain a calculated or concatenated value.   cid:129  It is unique within the entire database structure.   cid:129  It retains a majority of its characteristics when it appears in  more than one table.   Anatomy of a Field Specification   277  Anatomy of a Field Specification  A field specification incorporates various elements that define every  attribute of a field. All of the elements within the specification are  categorized as general elements, physical elements, or logical elements.  These element categories enable you to focus on a distinct aspect of  the field as you’re defining the specification, and they provide a way for  you to find a particular element quite easily.  Here are the elements within each category.   cid:129  General Elements: Field Name, Parent Table, Label, Specification  Type, Source Specification, Shared By, Alias es , Description   cid:129  Physical Elements: Data Type, Length, Decimal Places, Character  Support, Input Mask, Display Format   cid:129  Logical Elements: Key Type, Key Structure, Uniqueness, Null Sup- port, Values Entered By, Required Value, Default Value, Range of Values, Edit Rule, Comparisons Allowed, Operations Allowed  Figure 9.1 shows an example of a Field Specifications sheet. We’ll use  this sheet  or various portions of it  as we work on field specification  examples throughout the remainder of the book.  General Elements  Items under the General Elements category represent the most funda- mental attributes of the field. They provide information on the field’s  purpose, the name of the table s  in which the field appears, and the  pseudonyms the field assumes under certain circumstances.  Field Name  This is the set of absolute minimal words that uniquely identifies a  particular field throughout the database. You created and refined  field names earlier in the database design process  see Chapter 7,    278   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  FIELD SPECIFICATIONS  Specification Type:  Source Specification:  Unique  Generic  Replica  General Elements Field Name: Parent Table: Label:  Shared By: Alias es :  Description:  Physical Elements Data Type: Length: Decimal Places:  Input Mask: Display Format:  Logical Elements  Key Type:  Key Structure:  Uniqueness: Null Support: Values Entered By:  Required Value: Default Value:  Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  Same Field  Other Fields Value Expression  Character Support:  Letters     A–Z  Numbers  0–9   .

Parent Table  The table that incorporates a given field within its structure is known  as the field’s parent table. This is the only table in which the field will  appear unless the field is participating in establishing a relationship.   You’ll learn more about this exception in Chapter 10, “Table Relation- ships.”  For example, STUDENTS is the parent table of the STUDFIRST  NAME field.  Label  This is an alternate name  typically a shorter form of the field name   by which you can identify the field within an end-user application  interface that you create for the database. For example, you might use  QTY ON HAND as a label for a field named QUANTITY ON HAND because  many people in the organization are already accustomed to this par- ticular name. Labels can be particularly useful when you want to  conserve space on a data entry screen or squeeze more fields into a  particular report.  Avoid the temptation of using the label as the official field name within  the table structure; otherwise, you make it possible for someone to  misinterpret or incorrectly identify the field. Always use the most  precise and accurate name as the official field name and then use the  label  judiciously, of course  within your end-user interface applica- tions. This will enable you to make a distinction between the two at all  times.  Specification Type  The elements you set for a given field depend upon the type of specifi- cation you define for the field. You can define a specification in three  ways.   280   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  1. Unique: This is the default specification for all fields except those that serve as a template for other fields or those that participate within a table relationship as foreign keys. You can incorporate all but the Source Specification element for this type of specifi- cation, and the element settings you establish will apply only to the field indicated in the Field Name element.  2. Generic: This specification serves as a template for other field specifications and helps you ensure consistent definitions for fields that have the same general meaning. For example, you could create this type of specification for a generic STATE field and then use it as the basis for every other STATE field in the database. Fields such as CUSTSTATE, EMPSTATE, and VENDSTATE all have the same meaning  they represent a state within the United States , but there is enough of an obvious distinction between them to require that they remain separate fields.  If you recall, you learned about generic fields in Chapter 6, “Analyzing the Current Database,” when you were developing the Prelim- inary Field List and in Chapter 7 when you were working with the Elements of the Ideal Field.   A generic specification requires you to use a nonspecific field name and element settings that are as broad and general as possible. You can, however, incorporate any element except Par- ent Table, Label, Shared By, Alias es , and Source Specification.  3. Replica: This is the default specification for a field based on a  generic field or a field that serves as a foreign key within a table relationship, and it draws a majority of its element settings from an existing specification. You can incorporate elements that were not already incorporated by the source specification, and you can alter any element settings drawn from the source specification.  You’ll learn how to define each type of specification in the section  “Using Unique, Generic, and Replica Field Specifications” later in this  chapter.   Anatomy of a Field Specification   281  Source Specification  This element is set only on a Replica specification and indicates the  name of the specific field specification upon which the current specifi- cation is based.  You’ll see a good example of this element in the next  section.   Shared By  This element indicates the names of other tables that share this field.  The only table names that should appear here are those that have an  explicit relationship to the field’s parent table. For example, assume  you have a data table called EMPLOYEES that is related to two subset  tables called PART-TIME EMPLOYEES and FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES  via a field called EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER. As you create a field specifica- tion for EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER, you would use “PART-TIME EMPLOYEES,  FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES” as the setting for this element.  Alias es   This is a name  or set of names  that you use for the field in very rare  circumstances. One instance in which you would use an alias is when  there must be two occurrences of the field in the same table. Let’s  assume that an organization is accustomed to identifying its employ- ees by unique values within an EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER field. Now, con- sider the SUBSIDIARIES table structure in Figure 9.2  this is a partial  structure only .  In this instance, each subsidiary has a president and a vice president.  Both of these individuals must be represented in the table because of  their positions within the subsidiary organization, so there are two  EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER fields in the table structure. Proper database design,  however, dictates that there can only be one occurrence of this field  within the table; there is an obvious problem here. The only solution is  to use an alias for one or both occurrences of the EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER  field. For instance, you could  for sake of clarity  use PRESIDENT ID as an    282   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  Table Structures  Subsidiaries  Subsidiary ID Number Subsidiary Name Employee ID Number Employee ID Number SubsStreet Address SubsCity  Table Structures  Subsidiaries  Subsidiary ID Number  Subsidiary Name  President ID Number  Vice President ID Number  SubsStreet Address  SubsCity  Figure 9.2  A table requiring two occurrences of the same field  alias for the first occurrence of EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER and VICE PRESIDENT  ID as an alias for the second occurrence of EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER. With  the aliases in place, both employees are properly represented within the  table. Figure 9.3 shows the revised table structure.  Although using an alias is acceptable under these circumstances, you  should use them very judiciously; otherwise, they can become difficult   Figure 9.3  Using aliases in place of the EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER fields   Anatomy of a Field Specification   283  to manage and maintain, eventually conceal or disguise the true  meaning of the original fields, and cause you to misunderstand what  the data actually represents. This issue will become even clearer when  you begin to establish table relationships.  Description  This is a complete interpretation of the field. Composing a field descrip- tion is extremely beneficial because it forces you  and everyone in  the organization  to think carefully about the nature of the data that  will be stored in the field. You can be relatively sure that the field  requires further refinement if you have difficultly composing a suitable  description.  Earlier in the database design process you learned a set of guidelines  for composing a table description. Similarly, there is a set of guidelines  that governs how you compose a proper field description.  Guidelines for Composing a Field Description   cid:129  Use a statement that accurately identifies the field and clearly  states its purpose. The description should supplement the field name in terms of defining what the field represents. It should also state the field’s role within the table or its relationship to the table’s subject. Here’s an example of such a description:  CustCity—the metropolitan area in which a customer resides or  conducts business. This is an integral component of a custom- er’s complete address.   cid:129  Write a clear and succinct statement. The description should be  free of confusing sentences or ambiguous phrases. Although the description should be as complete as possible, use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the required information. As you’ve seen with table descriptions, verbose statements are difficult to read and understand.   284   Chapter 9  Field Specifications   cid:129  Refrain from restating or rephrasing the field name. Neither of  these practices does anything to illuminate the identity or pur- pose of the field. Remember that the purpose of a description is to provide a complete interpretation of the field. Here’s an exam- ple of a poor description:  CustLast Name—the last name of a customer.  A description is far more useful when you write it in this manner:  CustLast Name—the surname of a customer, whether original  or by marriage, that we use in all formal communications and  correspondence with that customer.   cid:129  Avoid using technical jargon, acronyms, or abbreviations. Although some people within the organization will understand these types of idioms, it’s better for you to use terminology that everyone understands. Remember that a description must be as clear as possible to anyone who reads it. For example, you should avoid this type of statement:  Employee ID Number—a unique number used to identify an  employee within the organization. It is a component of the SSP.  The problem with this description is that there is no inherent  way to determine the meaning of the acronym SSP. You could  resolve this problem by spelling out the complete term, but it  would be better for you to restate the purpose of the field.   cid:129  Do not include implementation-specific information. There’s no  reason to include the fact that a given field appears on a partic- ular data entry screen or is used within a specific piece of pro- gramming code. This type of information is more appropriate for the implementation phase of the overall database development process.   cid:129  Do not make this description dependent upon the description of  another field. Each description should be as complete as possi- ble and independent of every other description in the database.   Anatomy of a Field Specification   285  Interdependent descriptions introduce unnecessary confusion  and can inadvertently obscure the field’s true identity and pur- pose. Avoid using a description such as this:  Item Reorder Level—minimum number of items that must exist  for a particular product.  See description for Quantity On Hand.    cid:129  Do not use examples. As you learned in Chapter 7, using exam- ples in a description is a bad idea because they depend on sup- plemental information to convey their full meaning. You can ensure that a description is clear and succinct by keeping it absolutely free of examples.

Establishing these elements  during this phase of the design process helps you ensure consistent  field definitions throughout the database and reduces the time it will  take you to implement the field structures in an RDBMS program.   286   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  Data Type  This element indicates the nature of the data that the field stores.  In Chapter 1, “Relational Databases,” you learned that Structured  Query Language, or SQL, is the standard language used to create,  modify, maintain, and query relational databases. SQL is actually a  fully documented standard set forth jointly by the American National  Standards Institute  ANSI  and the International Organization for  Standardization  ISO . Although the current version of the standard   as of this writing  is SQL 2011, most major RDBMS programs still  seem to be supporting earlier versions of SQL, such as SQL 92 and  SQL 2008.  The SQL standard defines eight major data types, and each data type  has one or more uniquely named variations. Here’s a brief definition of  each data type.  1. Character: This data type stores a fixed- or varying-length char-  acter string of one or more printable characters. A fixed-length Character data type is known as CHARACTER or CHAR, and a varying-length Character data type is known as CHARACTER VARYING, CHAR VARYING, or VARCHAR.  2. National Character: This data type is the same as the Character data type, but it can also store characters from foreign-language character sets. A fixed-length National Character data type is known as NATIONAL CHARACTER, NATIONAL CHAR, or NCHAR, and a varying-length National Character data type is known as NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING, NATIONAL CHAR VARYING, or NCHAR VARYING.  3. Binary: This data type stores binary data such as images,  sounds, videos, or complex embedded documents such as word processing files or spreadsheets. This data type is often referred to as BIT or BIT VARYING.   Anatomy of a Field Specification   287  4. Exact Numeric: This data type stores whole numbers and num- bers with decimal places. Most RDBMS programs implement an Exact Numeric as NUMERIC, DECIMAL  DEC , INTEGER  INT , BIGINT, or SMALLINT, and each variation determines the range of values that the field will accept.  5. Approximate Numeric: This data type stores numbers with decimal  places and exponential numbers. Most RDBMS programs imple- ment an Approximate Numeric as FLOAT, REAL, or  DOUBLE PRECISION, and each variation determines the range of values that the field will accept.  6. Boolean: This data type stores true and false values, usually  in a single binary bit. Some RDBMS programs use BIT, INT, or TINYINT to store this data type.  7. DateTime: This data type is commonly known as DATE, TIME, or TIMESTAMP in most RDBMS programs, and it stores dates, times, and combinations of both. Note that the implementation of this data type varies widely among RDBMS programs, so you must make absolutely certain that you refer to the RDBMS’s documentation to determine how the RDBMS handles dates and times.  8.  Interval: This data type stores the quantity of time between two DateTime values, expressed either as year, month, year month day, time, or day time. Not all major database systems support this data type, so check your RDBMS’s documentation for fur- ther information.  Many RDBMS programs provide additional data types beyond those  specified by the standard, which are known as extended data types.  Examples of extended data types include MONEY CURRENCY and  SERIAL ROWID  for unique row identifiers .  I’ve presented the SQL standard data types because you will encoun- ter them  or variations thereof  in practically every RDBMS program. I    288   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  have not provided much detail on these data types, however, because  they are not implemented consistently across all RDBMS programs;  you must consult your RDBMS’s documentation to determine which  data types the RDBMS supports and how it implements them.  You can use any of the SQL data types  except Boolean and Interval  as  the setting for the Data Type element of a given specification. Due to  data type implementation inconsistencies, however, I recommend that  you use one of the following three general data types as the setting for  this element instead.  1. Alphanumeric: This data type stores any combination of letters, numbers, keyboard characters, or special characters. Keyboard characters include the comma, dollar sign, exclamation mark, percent sign, and period. Special characters include the copy- right symbol, the trademark symbol, and the symbol for pi.  2. Numeric: This data type stores only whole numbers and real  numbers. It will not accept numbers with leading zeroes  e.g., 0000234  because they are not genuine numbers.  3. DateTime: This data type stores dates, times, or a combination  of both.  These data types are quite suitable for indicating the nature of the  data that the field stores, and they are certainly much easier for users  and management to understand. Using general data types will help  you avoid unnecessary confusion, especially when you’re reviewing the  specification with users and management.  ❖ Note  I use these general data types as the basis for all further data type references and examples throughout the remainder of the book. You’ll certainly adjust these as necessary when you implement your database in a particular RDBMS program.   Anatomy of a Field Specification   289  Length  This element specifies the total number of characters that a user can  enter for any given field value. The RDBMS program you use to imple- ment the database will determine the maximum number of charac- ters you can set for this element. Although you can theoretically set  the Length element for any data type, you should be aware that some  RDBMS programs do not allow you to specify a length for a numeric  field. Instead, the RDBMS program sets the length of a numeric field  based on the type of number the field stores, such as an integer, a long  integer, or a real number.  Decimal Places  This denotes the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a  real number. The number of digits determines the real number’s pre- cision. For example, many businesses require that all currency values  have four digits of precision to the right of the decimal point.  Character Support  This element indicates the type of characters that a user can enter into  a given field value. Setting and enforcing this element helps you ensure  that the user cannot introduce meaningless data into the field, thus  enhancing field-level integrity.  Let’s say you’re working with a CUSTSTATE field and its data type is  alphanumeric. This data type is appropriate for the field because it  allows a user to incorporate letters as part of a given field value. But it  also allows him to use numbers, keyboard characters, and extended  characters, which means that he can enter a meaningless value into  the field—there are no state names or state abbreviations that con- tain characters other than letters. You solve this problem by using the  Character Support element to define the characters that the user can  incorporate within a field value.  I address the issue of a valid combi- nation of letters in the “Logical Elements” section.    290   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  You can choose to include or exclude any of the following types of  characters.   cid:129  Letters: All letters of the alphabet including foreign language let-  ters such as é and ñ.   cid:129  Numbers: 0 through 9.   cid:129  Keyboard characters: Any standard character other than  letters and numbers, such as asterisk, ampersand, bracket, caret, comma, equals sign, exclamation point, parenthesis, per- cent sign, period, pound sign, question mark, quote, semicolon, slash, or vertical bar. Note that the Field Specifications sheet includes examples of the characters that belong to this category.   cid:129  Special characters: Any character that you can produce only  through specific combinations of standard keys and the CTRL, ALT, and or S HIFT keys, or with the aid of a special software program. Characters in this category include complex mathe- matical symbols, the copyright symbol, fractions, the symbol for pi, and the trademark symbol. The Field Specifications sheet includes examples of these characters as well.  Input Mask  This element specifies the manner in which a user should enter data  into the field. For example, there are many ways to enter a date, such  as “01 01 12,” “01-01-12,” and “01-Jan-2012.” Using an input mask  helps you ensure that a user enters values into the field consistently  and  in this case  prevents confusion over the meaning of the date  sequence.  RDBMS programs implement input masks in various ways, so you  should use a relatively generic setting for this element.  You can assign  multiple input masks, if appropriate.  For example, you could use  “mm dd yy” as the input mask for a date field. This mask indicates    Anatomy of a Field Specification   291  the sequence of the date components  month, day, year , the structure  of the date  two numbers per component, e.g., 05 16 12 , and the date  component separator  the slash .  Display Format  This element governs the appearance of a field’s value when it is dis- played on a screen or printed within a document. A display format  enables you to present the field value in a more meaningful or read- able fashion than the manner in which it was entered. For example,  “03 13 2012” might be the way you enter a given date, but “March 13,  2012” is much easier to read and comprehend.  Use a generic setting for this element, just as you did with the Input  Mask; RDBMS programs implement display formats in various ways as  well. For example, you can use “Month Day, Year” as a display format  for a DATE HIRED field. You can also use a complete sentence to indicate  a display format, such as the one in this example of a display format  setting for a COMPANY NAME field:  Each word should start with a capital letter.  Figure 9.5 shows the Physical Elements section of a Field Specifica- tions sheet for an EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER field.

Its elements  govern matters such as whether each value should be unique, when a  value should be entered, whether a value can be edited, and the types  of comparisons and operations that can be performed on each value.  Setting these elements helps you establish and enforce a large part of  field-level integrity.  Key Type  This element designates a field’s role within a table, which you iden- tified as you were establishing a primary key for the table. As you  already know, a field can serve as a non-key, a primary key, or an alter- nate key. In Chapter 10, you’ll learn all about foreign keys and when to  designate a field as a foreign key on the Field Specifications sheet.  This element denotes whether a field designated as a primary key is  acting as a simple  single-field  primary key or as part of a composite   multifield  primary key.  Key Structure  Uniqueness  This element indicates whether a field’s values are unique. You set it  as “Unique” when the Key Type element is set to “Primary”; otherwise,  you’ll typically set this element as “Non-unique.”  When you work with a non-key field, think about how its values are  going to be used so that you can determine whether they should be  unique. Consider the DEPARTMENTS table structure in Figure 9.6.  In this example, the EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER field identifies the person who  manages a particular department. Assuming that a person is allowed  to manage only one department at any given time, the values in this  field should be unique; therefore, you should set the Uniqueness ele- ment for this field as “Unique.”   Anatomy of a Field Specification   293  Table Structures  Departments  Department ID Number Department Name Employee ID Number  Figure 9.6  Should the values of EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER be unique?  Null Support  This specifies whether a field accepts null values. “No Nulls” is the set- ting you’ll commonly use for this element, especially when a field serves  as a primary key or an alternate key, or when the field’s Required Value  element is set to “Yes.” You can set this element to “Nulls Allowed,”  however, when there is a valid reason for a field to accept null values.  A CUSTCOUNTY field, for example, must accept nulls because a customer  may not know the name of the county in which she lives.  Of course, it  will no longer be null once she supplies the county name.   Remember that a null does not represent a blank—it represents a miss- ing or unknown value. Users commonly make the mistake of using a  blank to represent a meaningful value, such as “None,” “Not Applicable,”  “No Response,” and “Not Wanted.” If these values are valid for a partic- ular field, then make sure you include them in the Range of Values ele- ment for the field. Above all, use nulls judiciously and do not use blanks!  Values Entered By  This element indicates the source of a field’s values. Either a user will  enter values into the field manually or a database application program  will enter them automatically; the application program can provide val- ues for the field only if the person who developed the program provided  a means for it to generate the values. Note that the setting that rep- resents the database application program is “System.”   294   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  Required Value  This denotes whether a user is required to enter a value for a field.  Although you’ll typically set this element to “No” for most of the fields  in a table, you must set it to “Yes” when the field serves as the primary  key. You may also need to set Required Value to “Yes” for a field such  as CUSTZIPCODE—a letter or package you send to a given customer must  include a zip code in order for the Postal Service to handle it properly  and accurately.  Default Value  This is a value that a user can enter into a field when a more appro- priate value is not yet available and nulls are disallowed. Use a default  value very judiciously, and only if it is meaningful. For example, “WA” is  a meaningful default value for a CUSTSTATE field when the vast majority  of your customers live in Washington. Conversely, “01 01 12” is not a  good default value for a DATE HIRED field because it is a completely arbi- trary value that has no real meaning.  Range of Values  This element specifies every possible valid value for a field. You can  set this element in various ways, such as with a lower and upper limit   1,000 to 9,999  or with a specific list of values  “WA,” “OR,” “ID,” “MT” .  There are three categories under which you can establish a range of  values.  1. General—a complete collection of every possible value for this  field. For example, the general range of values for a CUSTSTATE field might include all valid abbreviations for every state in the United States.  2.  Integrity-specific—a collection of values based on the field’s role within a table relationship.  You’ll learn all about this category in Chapter 10.    Anatomy of a Field Specification   295  3. Business-specific—a collection of values generated by a particular  business requirement. Organizations commonly have various requirements that limit the range of values for a field. In an organization that conducts its business strictly in the Pacific Northwest, for example, the valid range of values for a CUSTSTATE field are “WA,” “OR,” “ID,” and “MT.”  You’ll learn more about this category in Chapter 11, “Business Rules.”   You’re concerned only with the general range of values during this  stage of the database design process, and you’ll revisit the Range of  Values element later when you establish table relationships and busi- ness rules.  It’s important to note that “Other” and “Miscellaneous” are two values  that you do not want to set within any category of the Range of Val- ues element. Both values are nonspecific and absolutely meaningless  within this context and are a sign of mental laziness in that their  very presence indicates a need to review the field for possible refine- ment. You can avoid unnecessary confusion and potential problems by  refraining from using these values.  Edit Rule  This element designates at what point a user can enter a value into a  field and whether he can modify that value. You set this element to one  of these four options.  1. Enter Now, Edits Allowed: A user must enter a value for this field  when she creates a new record in the field’s parent table. She can then edit the value at any time.  2. Enter Later, Edits Allowed: A user has the option of entering a value for this field when he creates a new record in the field’s parent table. This does not imply in any way that the field’s value can be null for all time; the user must enter a value for   296   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  this field at some point in the near future. After he’s entered the  value, he can then edit it at any time.  3. Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed: A user must enter a value for this  field when she creates a new record in the field’s parent table, but she cannot edit it at any time whatsoever.  4. Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed: A user has the option of entering a value for this field when he creates a new record in the field’s parent table. This does not imply in any way that the field’s value can be null for all time; the user must enter a value for this field at some point in the near future. After he’s entered the value, he cannot edit it at any time whatsoever.  You should use a default value when you set the Edit Rule element to  the second or fourth option; this will keep the field’s value from being  null until such time that the user enters an appropriate value.  Comparisons Allowed  This indicates the types of comparisons a user can apply to a given  field value when he’s retrieving information from the field. There are  six types of comparisons: equal to  = , not equal to  ≠ ,  greater than  > ,  less than   = , and less than or equal to   <= . This element also indicates whether a user can compare a given  field value to any of the following.   cid:129  Another value within the same field. When a field serves as a pri-  mary key, this option applies to the values of related foreign key fields.  You’ll learn more about this in the next chapter.    cid:129  A value of another field within the parent table or from some  other table in the database.   cid:129  A value expression, which is some form of operation involving field values, literal values, or a combination of both. It returns   Anatomy of a Field Specification   297  a single value that you can then use for the comparison:  RETAIL  PRICE – 2.50  is an example of a value expression.  Controlling the types of comparisons a user can apply to the field’s val- ues enables you to keep him from making meaningless comparisons.  Let’s say that he’s working with an EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER field based on  a numeric data type. Unless you indicate otherwise, he can make a  comparison such as this one:  Is an Employee ID Number in the Employees table greater than or  equal to an Employee ID Number in the Part-Time Employees table?  Although a “greater than or equal to” comparison is generally accept- able in a numeric field, it is not appropriate in this instance; there is  no valid reason for him to make this type of comparison.  Similarly, it would be pointless for him to make a comparison between  a given EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER value and the value of another numeric  field within the EMPLOYEES table or some other table within the data- base; therefore, a comparison such as this is invalid:  Is an Employee ID Number in the Employees table greater than or  equal to a Quantity On Hand in the Products table?  It is both suitable and reasonable, however, for him to make a compari- son between a given EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER value within the EMPLOYEES  table and another EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER value within a related data table  or related subset table. This comparison, then, is a valid one:  Is an Employee ID Number in the Employees table equal to an  Employee ID Number in the Part-Time Employees table?  There are instances when it is perfectly suitable for the user to com- pare a particular value of one field to the value of a completely different  field. For example, it is totally logical for him to make the following  comparison between a DATE SHIPPED field and a DATE ORDERED field:   298   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  Is the current value of Date Shipped greater than or equal to the cur- rent value of Date Ordered?  It’s fortunate that he can make this type of comparison—he certainly  doesn’t want the value of DATE SHIPPED to be earlier than the value of  DATE ORDERED!  As you set the Comparisons Allowed element for a given field, think  about how you’re going to use the field’s values so that you can desig- nate the appropriate comparisons. It’s very likely that you’ll review this  element later in the design process when you establish table relation- ships and define business rules.  Operations Allowed  This element specifies the types of operations that a user can per- form on the field’s values. There are five types of operations: addition   + , subtraction  – , multiplication  × , division  ÷ , and concatenation.   Obviously, any combination of these operations is valid as well.  This  element also indicates whether an operation can incorporate    cid:129  Another value within the same field   cid:129  A value from another field within the parent table or from some  other table in the database   cid:129  The result of a value expression  which, as you recall, is itself  some form of operation involving field values, literal values, or a combination of both, that returns a single value   You can prevent the user from defining meaningless operations by lim- iting the types of operations that he can perform on the field’s values.  Let’s consider the EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER , DATE SHIPPED, and DATE ORDERED  fields once again. There is no reason for the user to perform mathe- matical operations on a pair of EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER values within the  EMPLOYEES table, nor is there any reason for him to perform such  operations using a given EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER value and some other    Anatomy of a Field Specification   299  numeric field’s value. In the case of the DATE SHIPPED field, however, it is  suitable to perform some of these operations using a given DATE SHIPPED  value and the value of some other appropriate date field within the  database. For example, the user might need to subtract DATE ORDERED  from DATE SHIPPED to determine the time that elapsed between the date  that the customer placed the order and the date that the items within  the order were shipped to the customer.  As you set the Operations Allowed element for a given field, think  about how you’re going to use the field’s values so that you can desig- nate the appropriate operations. It’s very likely that you’ll review this  element later in the design process as you define business rules.

You can ensure that you define the  appropriate type of specification for a given field by following these  simple guidelines.   cid:129  Use a Unique specification for any field that will appear only once  within the entire database or for a field that serves as a primary key.   cid:129  Use a Generic specification for a field that serves as a template for  other fields within the database. Remember to use a nonspecific field name and element settings that are as broad and general as possible.   cid:129  Use a Replica specification for a field that you base on a given generic field or for a field that serves as a foreign key within a table relationship.  Figure 9.8 shows the complete Unique field specification for a VENDOR  ID NUMBER field.  Here are a few things to note about this specification.  1. This field also appears in the PRODUCTS table, as indicated  by the Shared By general element. This is both reasonable and necessary because each product must be associated with a specific vendor.  You’ll learn more about this type of issue in the next chapter.   2. Examine the settings for the Uniqueness, Null Support,  Required Value, and Edit Rule logical elements.

For example, you can create a  VENDSTATE field based on the generic STATE field. You’ll define a Replica  specification for the VENDSTATE field that is based on the STATE field’s  Generic specification. Although the VENDSTATE field’s Replica specifi- cation draws its initial element settings from the STATE field’s Generic  specification, you can modify any of the Replica specification’s element  settings so that you can completely customize them for the VENDSTATE  field. Figure 9.10 shows the customized Replica field specifications for  the VENDSTATE field.  Here are a few things to note about this specification.  1. The field name  VENDSTATE  accurately denotes what the field  represents.  2. The label  “State”  is what the user will see on visual displays  and printed documents.  3. The Source Specification general element properly references the  generic STATE field’s specification.  4. The Description element is now specific to this field. Recall that  the description is more general in the source specification.  5. A default value has been set for this field; there is no such value  in the source specification.  6. The Range of Values element is now specific to this field; it was  much broader in the source specification.  In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to define a Replica field specifica- tion for a field that serves as a foreign key.

It will take you a considerable amount of time to com- plete this process, but remember that you’re working diligently to  establish field-level integrity by ensuring that the data is consistent,  valid, and as free from errors as possible. All your hard work will pay  great dividends because the information you retrieve from the data- base will always be timely and accurate, and you will have a reliable  set of structural blueprints you can use when you implement the data- base in an RDBMS program.  You can ensure that the specifications are as complete and accurate as  possible by working with both users and management to define them.  They can provide insights into the data and can be of special assistance  in refining the specification’s logical elements. You don’t have to speak  with everyone in the organization, but you do want to assemble and  meet with a representative number of people who are very familiar with  the data and how it is used. Schedule as many meetings as are neces- sary  or possible  to complete the interview process, and take the time  you need to be as thorough as you can. Above all, do not rush through  this phase! Doing so just diminishes the benefits of your overall efforts  and increases your chances of making unnecessary mistakes.  The best strategy for this task is to define as many of the specifications  as you can  as completely as possible  and then work with the partic- ipants to complete the rest. As you work with a field’s specifications,  use your best judgment to define the settings for each element. Don’t  worry if your settings seem slightly incorrect or if you have difficulty    Defining Field Specifications for Each Field in the Database   307  providing settings for some of the elements—you’re going to review  them with the participants anyway. After you’ve defined specifications  for all of the fields that are familiar to you, begin meeting with the par- ticipants to work on specifications for the remaining fields.  Your first order of business during the initial meeting is to explain the  various elements within a field specification and make sure that every- one understands them as much as possible. Providing the participants  with a brief and succinct education on the specification’s elements  gives them the knowledge they need to help you define a specification  properly.  In subsequent meetings, just review the elements to make  certain that everyone remembers what they represent.   Next, review all of the specifications you’ve defined and ask the partici- pants whether the settings for the elements are suitable and correct. In  some cases, the participants will reveal new information about a field  that will affect that field’s specification. For example, a participant may  remember  prompted by some topic in the discussion  that there is a  specific set of values that has always been used for a particular field;  therefore, you set the field’s Range of Values element to reflect this new  information. Make sure that you examine each part of the specification  and then move on to the next specification when the participants have  no further suggestions for refinement. Repeat this process for each  specification.  Now, work with the participants on the specifications you were unable  to define or complete. Try to work with the people who are most famil- iar with the fields under discussion because they are likely to know  what settings should be used for the Logical Elements category. Iden- tify the appropriate element settings for each field and mark them on  the Field Specifications sheet. After you’ve defined specifications for  every field in the database, the entire process is complete.   308   Chapter 9  Field Specifications  The design of the new database is now close to completion. In the next  chapter, you’ll learn how to establish relationships between the tables  in the database. Relationships are important because they allow a view  to draw data from multiple tables simultaneously.  CASE STUDY  Now that you have all the appropriate fields assigned to the tables in  the Mike’s Bikes database, it’s time to define field specifications for  each field. Before you meet with Mike and his staff, you define as many  field specifications as you can. None of the tables are unusual in any  way, and the fields are pretty straightforward, so you have little diffi- culty in defining the specifications. Figure 9.11 shows the specifica- tions for the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION field in the PRODUCTS table.  Now you meet with Mike and his staff to discuss the field specifica- tions you’ve defined. No one seems to have problems with any of the  specifications; everyone confirms that all of the element settings seem  suitable and correct. You do have a question, however, regarding the  CATEGORY field in the PRODUCTS table: You want to know the appro- priate setting for the Range of Values element. The response to your  question is mixed—no one seems to know the complete list of catego- ries that are valid for the field, so you decide to specify a general range  of values for now. Figure 9.12 shows the revised logical elements for the  CATEGORY field.  You’ll revisit this field  and its elements  again when you establish  business rules for the database. With this problem solved, your meet- ing—as well as the process of establishing field specifications—is  complete.

You learned  that defining specifications helps you establish and enforce field-level  integrity, enhances overall data integrity, and compels you to acquire a  complete understanding of the nature and purpose of the data in the  database. This level of understanding enables you to leverage the data  to your best advantage.  Next, we discussed the anatomy of a field specification. You’re now  familiar with the three categories of elements within the specifica- tion and the sheet you use to record them. We then discussed each    Review Questions  311  category and its elements in detail. As you now know, the General Ele- ments category represents the most basic attributes of the field. During  this discussion, you learned a set of guidelines that will help you com- pose a good field description. You also learned that you could define  three types of specifications, thus enabling you to establish and main- tain consistent field definitions. We examined the Physical Elements  category next, and you learned that it pertains to the structure of the  field. The Logical Elements category was the last topic of discussion in  this section. You now know that it mainly pertains to a field’s values  and that it includes elements such as Key Type, Null Support, Range of  Values, Edit Rule, Comparisons Allowed, and Operations Allowed.  We then discussed how to use each type of specification, and you  learned a set of guidelines that will help you determine which one to  define for a given field. You also examined samples of the specifica- tions, and you know how they differ.  The chapter ended with a discussion of defining field specifications  for each field. Here you learned that the best way to ensure complete  and accurate specifications is to work with users and management to  define them. You should first define as many specifications as you can  and then work with the staff to define specifications for the remaining  fields. You also learned that you could work with staff to refine the  specifications you initially defined.  Review Questions  1. State two major reasons why field specifications are important.  2.

You also learned that each  relationship has three distinct characteristics: the type of relationship  that exists between the tables, the manner in which each participates,  and the degree to which each table participates.  In this chapter, I’ll discuss these topics in more detail. You’ll first learn  how to identify and establish the relationships between the tables in a   313   314   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  database and then how to set each relationship’s characteristics. You’ll  also learn how to diagram tables and relationships, which will enable  you to create a graphic representation of the entire database structure.  Why Relationships Are Important  A relationship is an important component of a relational database.   cid:129  It establishes a connection between a pair of tables that are log-  ically related to each other. A pair of tables is logically related via the data each contains. For example, consider the tables in Figure 10.1.

A stu- dent can check out one or more instruments during the course  of a school year, so a record in the STUDENTS table  represent- ing the student  can be related to one or more records in the   STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table  representing the particular  instruments the student checks out .   cid:129  It helps to further refine table structures and minimize redundant  data. As you establish a relationship between a pair of tables,   Types of Relationships   315  you will inevitably make minor modifications to the table struc- tures. These refinements will make the structures more efficient  and minimize any redundant data that the tables may contain.   cid:129  It is the mechanism that enables you to draw data from multiple  tables simultaneously. In Chapter 12, “Views,” you’ll learn how a relationship enables you to construct a view using fields from two or more related tables.  A properly defined relationship ensures relationship-level integrity,  which guarantees that the relationship itself is reliable and sound.   Recall that relationship-level integrity is a component of overall data  integrity.  You can take advantage of the many benefits a relational  database provides only when you establish each relationship care- fully and properly. Failure to do so means that you’ll have a hard and  tedious time working with data from multiple tables, and you’ll cer- tainly encounter problems when you try to insert, update, or delete  records in related tables. You’ll learn more about these types of prob- lems later as the design process unfolds.  Types of Relationships  Before you begin to establish relationships between tables in the data- base, you must know what types of relationships can exist between  a given pair of tables. Knowing how to identify them properly is an  invaluable skill for designing a database successfully.  There are three specific types of relationships that can exist between  a pair of tables: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. The tables  participate in only one type of relationship at any given time.  You’ll  rarely need to change the type of relationship between a pair of tables.  Only major changes in either of the table’s structures could cause you  to change the relationship.    316   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  ❖ Note  The discussion for each type of relationship begins with a generic example of the relationship. Learning how to visualize a relationship generically enables you to understand the princi- ple behind the relationship itself. Once you understand how and why the relationship works, you’ll be able to determine whether it exists between a given pair of tables quite easily.  Each discussion also includes an example of how to diagram  the relationship. I provide special instructions pertaining to the  diagramming process where appropriate and explain the sym- bols incorporated within the diagram as necessary. This allows  you to learn the diagramming method at a reasonable pace and  keeps you from having to memorize the entire set of diagram  symbols all at once.  Figure 10.2 shows the first symbols you will use to diagram a table  relationship.

Figure 10.3 shows a generic example of a one-to-one  relationship.  As you can see, a single record in TABLE A is related to only one  record in TABLE B, and a single record in TABLE B is related to only  one record in TABLE A. A one-to-one relationship usually  but not  always  involves a subset table. Figure 10.4 shows an example of a  typical one-to-one relationship that you might find in a database for an  organization’s human resources department. This example also illus- trates a situation where neither of the tables is a subset table.  EmpID  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  Home Phone   >  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  ......  ......  ......

Only one record is required to store the com- pensation data for a given employee, so there is a distinct one-to-one  relationship between a record in the EMPLOYEES table and a record  in the COMPENSATION table.  Figure 10.5 shows a generic example of how you create a relationship  diagram for a one-to-one relationship.  This line indicates that a single record in TABLE B is related to only one record in TABLE A.  Table Name  Table Name  This line indicates that a single record in TABLE A is related to only one record in TABLE B,  Figure 10.5  Diagramming a one-to-one relationship  The line that appears between the tables in the diagram indicates the  type of relationship, and there is a particular line that you use for each  type. Later in this chapter, you’ll learn how to modify the line so that  it also shows the characteristics of the relationship. Figure 10.6 shows  the relationship diagram for the EMPLOYEES and COMPENSATION  tables in Figure 10.4.  Note that a Data Table symbol represents each  table.    Types of Relationships   319  Employees  Compensation  Figure 10.6  The relationship diagram for the EMPLOYEES and COMPENSATION  tables  One-to-Many Relationships  A one-to-many relationship exists between a pair of tables when a sin- gle record in the first table can be related to one or more records in the  second table, but a single record in the second table can be related to  only one record in the first table. Let’s look at a generic example of this  type of relationship.  Say you’re working with two tables, TABLE A and TABLE B, that have  a one-to-many relationship between them. Because of the relationship,  a single record in TABLE A can be related to one or more records in  TABLE B. Figure 10.7 shows the relationship from the perspective of  TABLE A.  Table A  Table B  Figure 10.7  A one-to-many relationship from the perspective of TABLE A  Conversely, a single record in TABLE B can be related to only one  record in TABLE A. Figure 10.8 shows the relationship from the per- spective of TABLE B.   320   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Table A  Table B  Figure 10.8  A one-to-many relationship from the perspective of TABLE B  This is by far the most common relationship that exists between a pair  of tables in a database, and it is the easiest to identify. It is crucial  from a data integrity standpoint because it helps to eliminate duplicate  data and to keep redundant data to an absolute minimum. Figure 10.9  shows a common example of a one-to-many relationship that you might  find in a database for an equipment rental store.

A single item, however, is associ- ated with only one customer at any given time, so a single record in  the  CUSTOMER RENTALS table is related to only one record in the   CUSTOMERS table.

Note that the crow’s foot symbol is always located next to the table on  the “many” side of the relationship.

Assume once again that you’re working with TABLE A and TABLE B  and that there is a many-to-many relationship between them. Because  of the relationship, a single record in TABLE A can be related to one or  more records  but not necessarily all  in TABLE B. Conversely, a single  record in TABLE B can be related to one or more records  but not nec- essarily all  in TABLE A. Figure 10.12 shows the relationship from the  perspective of each table.

A student can attend one or more classes during a school year, so a  single record in the STUDENTS table can be related to one or more  records in the CLASSES table. Conversely, one or more students will  attend a given class, so a single record in the CLASSES table can be  related to one or more records in the STUDENTS table.

Figure 10.14  Diagramming a many-to-many relationship  Students  Classes  Figure 10.15  The relationship diagram for the STUDENTS and CLASSES tables  Problems with Many-to-Many Relationships  A many-to-many relationship has an inherent peculiarity that you  must address before you can effectively use the data from the tables  involved in the relationship. The issue is this: How do you easily  associate records from the first table with records in the second table  in order to establish the relationship? This is an important question  because you’ll encounter problems such as these if you do not estab- lish the relationship properly.   cid:129  It will be tedious and somewhat difficult to retrieve information  from one of the tables.   cid:129  One of the tables will contain a large amount of redundant data.   Types of Relationships   325   cid:129  Duplicate data will exist within both tables.   cid:129  It will be difficult for you to insert, update, and delete data.  There are two common methods that novice and inexperienced devel- opers use in a futile attempt to address this situation. I’ll demon- strate how you might apply these methods using the STUDENTS and  CLASSES tables in Figure 10.16 as examples.  ❖ Note  As this example unfolds, keep in mind that every many- to-many relationship you encounter will exhibit these same issues.

The first method you might use to attempt to establish    326   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  a connection involves taking a field from one table and incorporating it  a given number of times within the other table.  This approach usually  appeals to people who are accustomed to working with spreadsheets.   For example, you could take the STUDENT ID field from the STUDENTS  table and incorporate it within the CLASSES table structure, creat- ing as many copies of the field as you need to represent the maximum  number of students that could attend any class. Figure 10.17 shows  the revised version of the CLASSES table structure.

Figure 10.18 shows the revised  version of the STUDENTS table structure.  Do these structures look  vaguely  familiar? They should. By using  this method, all you’ve done is to introduce a “flattened” multivalued  field into the table structure.

The second method you might attempt to use is simply a variation of  the first method. In this case, you take one or more fields from one  table and incorporate a single instance of each field within the other  table. For example, you could take the CLASS ID, CLASS NAME, and  INSTRUCTOR ID fields from the CLASSES table and incorporate them into  the STUDENTS table in order to identify the classes in which a student  is currently enrolled. This may seem to be a distinct improvement over  the first method, but you’ll see that there are problems that arise from  such modifications when you load the revised STUDENTS table with  sample data.   328   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Student ID  Student First Name  Student Last Name  Class ID  Class Name  Instructor ID  >  Students  60001  60001  60001  60001  60002  60002  60002  60003  60003  60003  60004  Zachary  Zachary  Zachary  Zachary  Susan  Susan  Susan  Joe  Joe  Joe  Diana  Erlich  Erlich  Erlich  Erlich  Black  Black  Black  Rosales  Rosales  Rosales  Price  900009  Introduction to Political Science  900002  Advanced Music Theory  900003  American History  900004  Computers in Business  900009  Introduction to Political Science  900002  Advanced Music Theory  900006  Introduction to Biology  900004  Computers in Business  900001  Advanced Calculus  900008  Introduction to Physics  900007  Introduction to Database Design  220087  220039  220148  220121  220087  220039  220117  220121  220101  220075  220120  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  ......  Figure 10.19  The revised STUDENTS table with sample data  Figure 10.19 clearly illustrates the problems you’ll encounter using this  method.   cid:129  The table contains unnecessary duplicate fields. You learned all about unnecessary duplicate fields and the problems they pose back in Chapter 7, so you know that using them here is not a good idea. Besides, it is very likely that the CLASS NAME and INSTRUCTOR ID fields are not appropriate in the STUDENTS table— the CLASS ID field identifies the class sufficiently, and it is really all you need to identify the classes a student is taking.   cid:129  There is a large amount of redundant data. Even if you remove the  CLASS NAME and INSTRUCTOR ID fields from the STUDENTS table, the CLASS ID field will still produce a lot of redundant data.   cid:129  It is difficult to insert a new record. If you enter a record in the STUDENTS table for a new class  instead of entering it in the CLASSES table  without also entering student data, the fields pertaining to the student will be null—including the primary key   Types of Relationships   329  of the STUDENTS table  STUDENT ID . This will automatically trig- ger a violation of the Elements of a Primary Key because the pri- mary key cannot be null; therefore, you cannot insert the record  into the table until you can provide a proper primary key value.   cid:129  It is difficult to delete a record. This is especially true if the only  data about a new class has been recorded in the particular student record you want to delete. Note the record for Diana Barlet, for example. If Diana decides not to attend any classes this year and you delete her record, you will lose the data for the “Introduction to Database Design” class. That might not create a serious problem—unless someone neglected to enter the data about this class into the CLASSES table as well. Once you delete Diana’s record, you’ll have to reenter all of the data for the class in the CLASSES table.  Fortunately, you will not have to worry about any of these problems  because you’re going to learn the proper way to establish a many-to- many relationship.  Self-Referencing Relationships  This particular type of relationship does not exist between a pair of  tables, which is why it isn’t mentioned at the beginning of this section.  It is instead a relationship that exists between the records within a  table. Ironically, you’ll still regard this throughout the design process  as a table relationship.  A table bears a self-referencing relationship  also known as a recursive  relationship  to itself when a given record in the table is related to  other records within the table. Similar to its dual-table counterpart,  a self-referencing relationship can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or  many-to-many.   330   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  One-to-One  A self-referencing one-to-one relationship exists when a given record in  the table can be related to only one other record within the table. The  MEMBERS table in Figure 10.20 is an example of a table with this  type of relationship. In this case, a given member can sponsor only one  other member within the organization; the SPONSOR ID field stores the  member identification number of the member acting as a sponsor. Note  that Susan Black is Tom Wickerath’s sponsor.

This may sound somewhat confusing at first, but the example  in Figure 10.24 should help clarify the matter.  In this case, a particular part can comprise several different com- ponent parts, and it can itself be a component of other parts.

Parts  Figure 10.25  Diagramming a self-referencing many-to-many relationship  ❖ Note  Before you begin to work through the examples in the remainder of the chapter, now is a good time to remember a prin- ciple I presented in the introduction:  Focus on the concept or technique and its intended results, not  on the example used to illustrate it.    Identifying Existing Relationships   333  There are, without a doubt, any number of ways in which you can relate  the tables in these examples  and also in the case studies , depend- ing on each table’s role within a given database. The manner in which  I use the examples here is not important; what is important are the  techniques I use to identify and establish relationships between tables.  Once you learn these techniques, you can identify and establish rela- tionships for any pair of tables within any context you may encounter.  Now that you’ve learned about the various types of table relationships,  your next task is to identify the relationships that currently exist  among the tables in the database.  Identifying Existing Relationships  When you were composing the table descriptions earlier in the data- base design process  back in Chapter 7, to be exact , you assembled  a representative group of users and management to help you with  that task. These people were also designated as representatives of the  organization and granted the authority to aid in the decision-making  process throughout the remainder of the database design process.  At  least, this is the current assumption for the sake of discussion and  example.  Now you’ll arrange meetings with this group once again so  that they can help you identify existing table relationships. These folks  can provide valuable input because they are likely to have a good per- spective on how various subjects  or tables  are related. Although their  perceptions of the manner in which these subjects are related may not  always be complete or accurate, their contributions will still be useful  in identifying most of the relationships.  Begin the process of identifying relationships by creating a matrix of  all the tables in your database.  You can do this on a sheet of paper, a  white board, or a spreadsheet program.  For example, assume you’re  working with these tables:   334   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  BUILDINGS  FACULTY   STUDENTS  CLASSES  ROOMS  COMPENSATION   STAFF   List each of the tables across the top of the matrix, and then again  down the left-hand side of the matrix; make certain the table names  are in the same order. Figure 10.26 illustrates how the matrix should  appear.  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  Figure 10.26  Setting up a table matrix to help identify existing relationships  Select a table on the left as a starting point and determine whether it  has a relationship with any of the tables listed across the top, working  your way through the matrix as you do so.  It doesn’t matter whether  you work your way across the top or down the side. Just make sure  you work consistently, as it will make the task much easier.   Keep in mind that you’re looking for direct relationships only—there  must be a specific connection between tables participating in the rela- tionship. For example, the CLASSES table has a direct relationship to  the STUDENTS table because one or more students can attend a given  class. Conversely, the CLASSES table has an indirect relationship to  the STAFF table via the FACULTY table; it is a faculty member that  teaches a class, not a staff member.  You don’t have to worry about  indirect relationships just yet.    Identifying Existing Relationships   335  As you work with a pair of tables, ask the participants questions about  the records in each table. Your goal is to determine the relationship  between a single record in one table to one or more records in the  other table, and vice versa.  Remember that each record represents a  single instance of the subject represented by the table.  When you get  to a point where you’re examining the same table on both sides of the  matrix, try to determine the relationship between a given record in the  table to one or more other records within the table itself.  There are two types of questions you can ask.  1. Associative: This is a simple and straightforward type of ques-  tion that you can generically phrase as follows: Can a single record in  name of first table  be associated with one or more records in  name of second table ? Considering the matrix in Figure 10.26, you might ask an associative question such as this:  Can a single record in CLASSES be associated with one or  more records in BUILDINGS?  You can use this type of question to determine whether a table  has a self-referencing relationship by making two minor modi- fications to the question itself: Can a single  singular form of the  table name  be associated with one or more  plural form of the  table name ? For example, here’s a question you might pose for  the STAFF table:  Can a single staff member be associated with one or more other  staff members?  2. Contextual: This type of question contrasts a single instance of the subject represented by the first table against multiple instances of the subject represented by the second table. There are two categories within this type of question: ownership-  oriented and action-oriented.   336   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  a. Ownership-oriented questions include words or phrases such as own, has, is part of, and contain. Here’s an example of this type of question:  Can a single order contain one or more products?  You can use this question to test for a self-referencing relation- ship by making the same modifications you made to the asso- ciative question. Here’s an example of a question you might pose  for a PARTS table:  Can a single part contain one or more other parts?  b. Action-oriented questions incorporate action verbs such as  make, visit, place, teach, and attend. Here’s an example of this type of question:  Does a single flight instructor teach one or more types of classes?  As you may have already guessed, you can use this question  to test for a self-referencing relationship as well by making the  same modifications:  Does a single staff member manage one or more other staff  members?  Use the type of question you believe to be the most appropriate for the  pair of tables you’re working with. As you work down the list of tables  in the matrix, you’ll eventually realize that you’re asking questions  about a given pair of tables twice—once from the perspective of the  first table and then again from the perspective of the second table. The  answers to both of these questions will identify the type of relationship  that exists between the tables.  Continuing with the example, assume that you’ve decided to start with  the CLASSES table and this is your first question:  Is a single class held in one or more buildings?   Identifying Existing Relationships   337  The answer to this question will reveal the type of relationship that  exists between these tables from the perspective of the CLASSES table.  If you receive the following answer, then a one-to-one relationship  exists between these tables:  A single class is held in only one building.  If you receive this answer, however, then a one-to-many relationship  exists between the two tables:  A single class may be held in more than one building.  Once you’ve identified the relationship, indicate the relationship type  in the box located at the junction of the CLASSES table row  on the  left  and the BUILDINGS table column  on the top . You can use the  following shorthand symbols for the relationship types:  1:1—one-to-one  1:N—one-to-many  M:N—many-to-many  ❖ Note  You won’t need the many-to-many shorthand symbol at this point, but I’ve included it here for completeness.  Figure 10.27 shows how the table matrix looks after you’ve finished  identifying relationships for the CLASSES table. Remember that the  relationships indicated here are from the perspective of the CLASSES  table.  You’ve probably noticed that some of the junction boxes are empty; this  is perfectly acceptable. It’s unnecessary for you to enter anything into  the junction box if there is no relationship between the tables at either  end of the junction.   338   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  1:1  1:N  1:1  1:N  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  Figure 10.27  Completed table-matrix entries for the CLASSES table  Now you repeat this process for each table on the left-hand side of the  matrix. Remember that you can start with any table. Let’s assume that  you decide to continue with the BUILDINGS table, and you’re attempt- ing to identify the relationship between it and the CLASSES table. Yes,  I know you’ve covered this once already, but in this case you’re iden- tifying the relationship from the perspective of the BUILDINGS table.  Let’s now assume that you ask this question:  Does a single building provide space for more than one class?  If the answer is yes, then a one-to-many relationship exists between  these tables; otherwise, it’s a one-to-one relationship. Once you’ve iden- tified the relationship, indicate the relationship type in the box located  at the junction of the BUILDINGS table row  on the left  and the  CLASSES table column  on the top . Figure 10.28 shows the revised  table matrix with your entries for the BUILDINGS table.  You’ve just seen two examples of how to identify a relationship between  a distinct pair of tables, so let’s take a look at how you identify a  self-referencing relationship for a single table. Assume you’re work- ing with the STAFF table, and you’re now at the junction between the  STAFF table on the left and the STAFF table on the top. Using the    Identifying Existing Relationships   339  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  1:N  1:1  1:N  1:1  1:N  1:N  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  Figure 10.28  Completed table-matrix entries for the BUILDINGS table  techniques you learned earlier in this section, you might pose a ques- tion such as this:  Can a single staff member be associated with one or more other staff  members?  As with the earlier examples, the answer will indicate the type of rela- tionship. Say you received this answer:  Yes, a given staff member can be the spouse of another staff member.  This indicates  rather obviously  that a self-referencing one-to-one  relationship exists for the STAFF table. But assume you received this  answer instead:  Yes, a single staff member can manage several other staff members.  You probably quickly realized that this answer indicates that a self-  referencing one-to-many relationship exists for the STAFF table.  Identifying these two types of relationships is a relatively easy task;  identifying a self-referencing many-to-many relationship can be  slightly more difficult.  This is the type of question you must ask in order to determine  whether a table has a self-referencing many-to-many relationship: Can    340   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  a single  singular form of the table name  be associated with one or  more other  plural form of the table name , and can any of those  plural  form of the table name  then be associated with yet one or more other   plural form of the table name ? For example, here’s a question you  might pose for the STAFF table:  Can a single staff member be associated with one or more other staff  members, and can any one of those staff members then be associated  with one or more other staff members?  An answer such as the following  or one very similar to it  indi- cates that the STAFF table has a self-referencing many-to-many  relationship:  Yes, a given staff member can manage several other staff members,  and any one of those folks can then supervise one or more other staff  members.  Once you’ve identified the type of self-referencing relationship that  exists for the table, you indicate it in the table matrix as you would  any other relationship.  Relationships will often differ from one perspective to the other, and  you must know how to determine what type of relationship officially  exists between each pair of tables on the matrix. You make this deter- mination using the following set of formulas; each formula corre- sponds to a particular relationship type definition.  I’ve provided the  definitions as a point of reference.   1:1 + 1:1 = 1:1   A pair of tables bears a one-to-one relationship  when a single record in the first table is related  to only one record in the second table, and a sin- gle record in the second table is related to only  one record in the first table.  1:N + 1:1 = 1:N   A one-to-many relationship exists between a pair  of tables when a single record in the first table    Identifying Existing Relationships   341  can be related to one or more records in the sec- ond table, but a single record in the second table  can be related to only one record in the first table.  1:N + 1:N = M:N  A pair of tables bears a many-to-many relation- ship when a single record in the first table can  be related to one or more records in the second  table and a single record in the second table can  be related to one or more records in the  first table.  Here is the specific procedure you’ll use to identify the official rela- tionship between a pair of tables in the matrix.  It incorporates the  relationship formulas in the preceding list.  Let’s first look at a generic  version of the procedure.  1. Select a pair of tables and note the entry at the junction  between the first table and the second table.  2. Locate the second table on the same side of the matrix you’re working on and note the entry at the junction between it and the first table on the opposite side of the matrix.  3. Apply the appropriate formula to the two entries and identify  the official relationship between the tables.  4. Diagram the relationship in the appropriate manner.  5. Cross out both entries on the matrix.  Now, let’s take a look at how you apply this procedure to a pair of  tables in the matrix.  In this example, you’re working down the left- hand side of the matrix.   1. Assume you’ve selected the BUILDINGS and CLASSES tables.  You note that the entry at the junction between BUILDINGS and CLASSES is 1:N.   342   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  2. Now you proceed down the left-hand side of the matrix until you  locate the CLASSES table and then note that the entry at the junction between the CLASSES and BUILDINGS table is 1:1.  3. Using these entries with the appropriate formula, you deter-  mine that the official relationship between the BUILDINGS and CLASSES tables is 1:N.  1:N + 1:1 = 1:N   4. You create a one-to-many relationship diagram for the BUILD-  INGS and CLASSES tables.  5. You cross out the entries on the matrix.  Figure 10.29 shows the results of your work.

This is due to the fact that the BUILDINGS table is  on the “one” side of the relationship. When you create a simple diagram    Identifying Existing Relationships   343  such as this, I recommend that you always show the “one” side of the  relationship on the left and the “many” side on the right. Following this  practice will make your diagrams easy to read and help ensure that  you create them in a consistent manner.  This practice is unnecessary,  however, when you create a complex diagram showing the relation- ships between several tables.   At the very least, you should include each table’s primary key in the  diagram. Doing so will prove to be a valuable visual aid when you  begin to establish the relationships. You could go so far as to display  each table’s complete structure  as you see in Figure 10.30 , assum- ing you have space on the diagram. Displaying the structures in this  manner often helps to reinforce the decision you’ve made regarding the  type of relationship that exists between the tables.  I use both types of  diagrams throughout the remainder of the book.   ❖ Note  You’ll occasionally find it difficult to identify the exact relationship between a given pair of tables. When this happens, just load the tables with some sample data. This usually helps to reveal the type of relationship that exists between the tables.

As Figure 10.31 illustrates, all you have to do  here is diagram the relationship and cross out the entry on the matrix.  Staff  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  1:N  1:1  1:N  1:N  1:1  1:1  1:N  1:1  1:1  Buildings  Classes  Compensation  Faculty  Rooms  Staff  Students  1:1  1:1  1:N  1:N  1:N  1:N  Figure 10.31  Working with a self-referencing relationship  Continue this procedure until you’ve eliminated all of the entries on  the matrix. When you’ve finished identifying the official relationships  among the tables in the database, you can then go through the pro- cess of establishing each relationship in the appropriate manner.  Establishing Each Relationship  This process involves defining an explicit logical connection between a  pair of related tables. The type of relationship that exists between the  tables determines the manner in which you define the connection.   Establishing Each Relationship   345  One-to-One and One-to-Many Relationships  You use a primary key and a foreign key to establish the connection  between tables participating in a one-to-one or one-to-many relation- ship.  You’ll learn the definition of a foreign key in just a moment.   The One-to-One Relationship  In this type of relationship, one table serves as a parent table and  the other serves as a child table. A record must exist in the parent  table before you can enter a related record in the child table; stated  another way, a record in the child table must have a related record in  the parent table. The roles you assign to the tables usually depend on  the subjects they represent, although there will be instances when  you can assign the roles rather arbitrarily. In Figure 10.32, for exam- ple, you would most likely assign the parent role to the STAFF table  and the child role to the COMPENSATION table. This is a reasonable  assumption because it would be completely illogical to have a record  in the COMPENSATION table that is not related to a record in the  STAFF table.

There are instances, however,  when you can assign the parent role to the subset table.  You establish a one-to-one relationship by taking a copy of the parent  table’s primary key and incorporating it within the structure of the  child table, where it then becomes a foreign key.  The term foreign key  is derived from the fact that the child table already has a primary key  of its own, and the primary key you are introducing from the parent  table is “foreign” to the child table.  In most one-to-one relationships,  however, the foreign key also serves as the child table’s primary key.  Figure 10.33 illustrates how you would establish the relationship  between the STAFF and FACULTY tables. STAFF is the parent table  in this case because a record in the FACULTY table must be related  to a record in the STAFF table; faculty members are drawn from the  school’s staff. If you were to follow the procedure you just learned, you  would take a copy of the STAFF table’s primary key and incorporate it  as a foreign key in the FACULTY table.

Recall  that a subset table and the data table from which it was derived must  share the same primary key. You learned how to define a subset table  in Chapter 7 and how to establish its primary key in Chapter 8, “Keys.”   Figure 10.34 shows a slightly different example of a one-to-one rela- tionship. Assume that MANAGERS is a subset table of EMPLOYEES  but has a direct relationship to DEPARTMENTS—a single manager  is associated with only one department and a single department is  associated with only one manager. Further assume that MANAGERS  is the parent table and DEPARTMENTS is the child table.  This is a  good example of a scenario in which you can choose the roles rather  arbitrarily. It’s also an instance of when a subset table plays the parent  role within the relationship.

As long as you can visualize this process generically, you’ll be able to  establish any one-to-one relationship you encounter.    348   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Managers  Departments  Employee ID EMail Address Cellular Phone Number  PK  PK  FK  Department ID  Employee ID DeptName DeptCategory Maximum Staff Level  Figure 10.35  Establishing the relationship between the MANAGERS and  DEPARTMENTS tables  ❖ Note  Many database designers will use MANAGER ID as the primary key name in the MANAGERS table and the foreign key name in the DEPARTMENTS table.

You’ll learn about foreign keys later in this chapter.    cid:129  It removes any possible ambiguity or doubt about the true  nature of a foreign key.  I’ll explain this in more detail during the discussion of the Elements of a Foreign Key.   There is no absolute right or wrong way to do this—in the end,  the approach you use is simply a matter of style. Once you decide  which approach you want to use, however, make certain you use  it consistently.   Establishing Each Relationship   349  There is a small change in the way you’ll diagram the relationships  from this point forward. You should now use the primary key as the  beginning point and the foreign key as the end point of the relation- ship line.  The only exception will be when you’re diagramming the  relationship between a subset table and its parent data table.  Mak- ing this minor modification will help you visualize the relationships  more clearly and make it easier to identify the fields that establish the  relationship.  The One-to-Many Relationship  The technique you use to establish a one-to-many relationship is  similar to the one you used to establish a one-to-one relationship.  You simply take a copy of the primary key from the table on the “one”  side of the relationship and incorporate it within the table structure  on the “many” side, where it then becomes a foreign key. For example,  consider the one-to-many relationship between the BUILDINGS and  ROOMS tables shown in Figure 10.36.  Buildings  Building Number Number of Floors Elevator Access Site Parking Available  PK  PK  Rooms  Room Number Type of Room Square Footage Phone Available  Figure 10.36  The existing one-to-many relationship between the BUILDINGS  and ROOMS tables  The relationship between these two tables is such that a single  building can contain one or more rooms, but a single room is con- tained within only one building. Using the procedure outlined earlier,  you establish this relationship by taking a copy of the primary key    BUILDING NUMBER  from the BUILDINGS table and incorporating it as  a foreign key within the ROOMS table. Now, revise the relationship    350   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  diagram and make the same type of adjustments as you did with the  diagram for the one-to-one relationship. Your revised diagram should  look like the one in Figure 10.37.  Note that the middle line of the  crow’s foot symbol is the significant connection point—it should point  directly to the foreign key.   Buildings  Building Number Number of Floors Elevator Access Site Parking Available  PK  Rooms  Room Number  Building Number Type of Room Square Footage Phone Available  PK  FK  Figure 10.37  Establishing the one-to-many relationship between the BUILDINGS  and ROOMS tables  Resolving Multivalued Fields—Revisited  Back in Chapter 7 you learned how to resolve a multivalued field by  using this generic procedure:  1. Remove the field from the table and use it as the basis for a new table. If necessary, rename the field in accordance with the field naming guidelines that you learned earlier in this chapter.  2. Use a field  or set of fields  from the original table to relate the  original table to the new table; try to select fields that represent the subject of the table as closely as possible. The field s  you choose will appear in both tables.  3. Assign an appropriate name, type, and description to the new  table and add it to the final table list.  You used this procedure to resolve a multivalued field called CATEGORIES  TAUGHT in an INSTRUCTORS table. Figure 10.38 shows the original  version of the table and the results of applying the procedure.

You’ll  see this when you examine the original INSTRUCTORS table in Figure  10.38. A single instructor  such as Kira Bently  can teach one or more  categories  DTP, SS, WP —this holds true for every record in the table.  When you properly resolve the multivalued field, the tables produced  by the procedure inherit the relationship. This is clearly the case with  the revised INSTRUCTORS and new INSTRUCTOR CATEGORIES  tables. You can now establish this one-to-many relationship as you  would any other.  Of course, this assumes that you’ve assigned a pri- mary key to the INSTRUCTORS table.  Figure 10.39 shows the results  of properly establishing this relationship.  The INSTRUCTOR ID field in the INSTRUCTOR CATEGORIES table serves  as a foreign key and helps to establish the one-to-many relation- ship between the INSTRUCTORS and INSTRUCTOR CATEGORIES  tables. INSTRUCTOR ID is also part of the composite primary key for the    352   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Instructors  Instructor ID  60001 60002 60003 60004  InstFirst Name Kira Timothy Susan Estela  InstLast Name Bently Ennis Black Rosales  InstStreet Address 3131 Mockingbird Lane 7402 Kingman Drive 4141 Lake City Way 970 Phoenix Avenue  InstCity Seattle Redmond Seattle Bellevue  ...... ...... ...... ......

The Many-to-Many Relationship  You establish a many-to-many relationship with a linking table. This is  a new table that you’ll create using the following three-step procedure.  1. Define the linking table by taking copies of the primary key  from each table in the relationship and using those keys to form the structure of the table. These fields will serve two distinct purposes within the linking table: Together they constitute the table’s composite primary key, and each is a unique foreign key that helps to establish a relationship between its parent table and the linking table.  2. Give the linking table a name that represents the nature of  the relationship between the two tables. For example, if you’re establishing a many-to-many relationship between a PILOTS table and a CERTIFICATIONS table, you might choose to call the linking table PILOT CERTIFICATIONS.  3. Add the linking table to the final table list and make the proper  entries for “Table Type” and “Table Description.”   Establishing Each Relationship   353  Student Classes  Student ID CPK FK Class ID CPK FK  PK  Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  Students  PK  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address Social Security Number  Figure 10.40  Establishing the many-to-many relationship between the STU- DENTS and CLASSES tables  Figure 10.40 shows how you establish the many-to-many relationship  between the STUDENTS and CLASSES tables.  Note the new diagram  symbol used to represent a linking table.   ❖ Note  You could have used STUDENT SCHEDULES or CLASS SCHEDULES as the name of the linking table; STUDENT CLASSES just happens to be my personal preference. The point to remember is that you should use a name that makes the most sense to you or the organization.  Creating a linking table produces a few noteworthy results.   cid:129  The original many-to-many relationship has been dissolved  because there is no longer a direct relationship between the STU- DENTS and CLASSES tables. The original relationship has been replaced by two one-to-many relationships: one between STU- DENTS and STUDENT CLASSES and another between CLASSES and STUDENT CLASSES. In the first relationship, a single record in STUDENTS can be associated with one or more records in   354   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  STUDENT CLASSES, but a single record in STUDENT CLASSES  table can be associated with only one record in STUDENTS.  In the second relationship, a single record in the CLASSES  table can be associated with one or more records in STUDENT  CLASSES, but a single record in STUDENT CLASSES can be  associated with only one record in CLASSES.   cid:129  The STUDENT CLASSES linking table contains two foreign keys.  STUDENT ID and CLASS ID are both copies of the primary keys from the STUDENTS and CLASSES tables, respectively; therefore, each is a foreign key by definition. As such, they help to establish the relationship between their parent tables and the linking table.   cid:129  The STUDENT CLASSES linking table has a composite primary  key composed of the STUDENT ID and CLASS ID fields. Except in rare instances, a linking table always contains a composite primary key.  This rule applies to the database’s logical design only. There are various reasons why you might break this rule when you transform the logical design into a physical design, but this is a discussion that is beyond the scope of this book.  It’s import- ant to note that you’ll occasionally have to add more fields to the linking table in order to guarantee a unique primary key value. For example, assume the school decides to record student sched- ules for every term of the school year  fall, winter, and spring . You would have to add a new field, perhaps called TERM, and des- ignate it as part of the composite primary key. This would enable you to enter another instance of a given student and class into the table, but for a different term; a student may need to retake a class during the spring term because he failed the class in the fall term.   cid:129  The linking table helps to keep redundant data to an absolute minimum. There is no superfluous data in this table at all. In fact, the main advantage of this table structure is that it allows you to enter as few or as many classes for a single student as are   Establishing Each Relationship   355  necessary. Later in the database design process, you’ll learn how  to create views to draw the data from these tables together in  order to present it as meaningful information.   cid:129  The name of the linking table reflects the purpose of the rela- tionship it helps establish. The data stored in the STUDENT CLASSES table represents a student and the classes in which he or she is enrolled.  As you work with many-to-many relationships, there will be instances  in which you will need to add fields to the linking table in order to  reduce data redundancy and further refine structures of the tables  participating in the relationship. For example, assume you’re working  on a new database with a colleague and he’s just brought the ORDERS  and PRODUCTS tables in Figure 10.41 to your attention.  Orders  Order Number Customer Number Order Date Ship Date Employee ID Product Number Quantity Ordered Quote Price  PK FK  FK  Products  PK  Product Number ProdName ProdDescription Category Wholesale Price Quote Price  Figure 10.41  Is there a problem with either of these tables?  You note that there’s a many-to-many relationship between the tables  and then realize that your colleague tried to establish this relationship  by taking a copy of the PRODUCT NUMBER and QUOTE PRICE fields from the  PRODUCTS table and incorporating them into the ORDERS table. He  thought that this was the best way to associate various products with  a particular order. The presence of these fields in the ORDERS table,  however, produces a large amount of redundant data. Figure 10.42  illustrates this problem quite clearly.   356   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Orders  1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1001 1001 1001  Order Number  Customer Number  Order Date   >  Product Number  Quantity Ordered  Quote Price  9001 9001 9001 9001 9001 9001 9001 9001 9012 9012 9012  05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12 05 16 12  ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ......  410001 410004 410005 410007 410011 410015 410021 410029 410011 410015 410022  4 12 6 5 5 11 2 8 5 3 12  8.95 3.75 5.99 6.50 6.50 4.45 31.50 5.00 6.50 4.00 6.35  Figure 10.42  Redundant data caused by an improperly established many-to- many relationship  You can enter only one product number, quantity ordered, and quote  price for any given record; therefore, you’ll have to enter a new record  into the table for each item a customer places on his order. Customer  number 9001, for example, included eight items on an order he made  on May 16, so there are eight records in the table for this order alone.  Based on what you learned earlier in this chapter, you know that this  is an improper way to establish this relationship. You also know that  you can establish the relationship properly by creating and using  a linking table. So you remove the PRODUCT NUMBER field from the  ORDERS table, establish the relationship in the appropriate manner,  and revise the relationship diagram. Figure 10.43 shows the results of  your work.  You’ve eliminated the redundant data in the ORDERS table, but you  still have two minor problems.  1. The QUOTE PRICE and QUANTITY ORDERED fields are no longer  appropriate for the ORDERS table; the ORDERS table’s primary key does not exclusively identify their values, and they bear no   Establishing Each Relationship   357  Order Details  Order Number CPK FK Product NumberCPK FK  Products  PK  Product Number ProdName ProdDescription Category Wholesale Price Quote Price  Orders  Order Number Customer Number Order Date Ship Date Employee ID Quantity Ordered Quote Price  PK FK  FK  Figure 10.43  Properly establishing the many-to-many relationship between the  ORDERS and PRODUCTS tables  relationship to any of the remaining fields in the table. They do,  however, relate to a particular PRODUCT NUMBER that’s part of a  given order within the ORDER DETAILS table.  2. You have duplicate data because there are two copies of the  QUOTE PRICE field: one in the ORDERS table and another in the PRODUCTS table.  So you resolve the first problem by removing the QUOTE PRICE and  QUANTITY ORDERED fields from the ORDERS table and incorporating  them within the ORDER DETAILS table. You then resolve the second  problem by deleting the QUOTE PRICE field from the PRODUCTS table;  it makes more sense to associate a quote price with a product as it’s  being ordered. Finally, you modify the relationship diagram to reflect  the changes you made to the structures. Figure 10.44 shows your  revised diagram.  When you establish a many-to-many relationship between a pair of  tables, make certain that you check each table and determine whether  there are any fields that you should transfer to the linking table. When  in doubt, load all the tables with sample data; this will usually reveal  any potential problems.   358   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Orders  Order Number Customer Number Order Date Ship Date Employee ID  PK FK  FK  Order Details  Order Number CPK FK Product NumberCPK FK Quantity Ordered Quote Price  PK  Products  Product Number ProdName ProdDescription Category Wholesale Price  Figure 10.44  The revised ORDER DETAILS linking table  ❖ Note  You won’t encounter this problem very often if you faithfully follow the design process you’ve learned thus far. It will typically arise, however, when you’re trying to incorporate a pair of tables from an existing database or legacy database and you haven’t taken the time to refine their structures properly. You’ll also encounter this problem when you work with someone who has little or no database design experience.  Self-Referencing Relationships  Establishing a self-referencing relationship will be a relatively simple  task now that you know how to establish a relationship between a pair  of tables.  One-to-One and One-to-Many  You use a primary key and a foreign key to establish these self-refer- encing relationships, just as you do with their dual-table counterparts.  The difference here, however, is that the foreign key will reside in the  same table as the primary key to which it refers. You’ll often find that  the foreign key is already part of the table’s structure. If the foreign key  does not already exist, you’ll simply create one.   Establishing Each Relationship   359  Let’s revisit the MEMBERS table example from Figure 10.20. Recall  that this table has a self-referencing one-to-one relationship because a  given member can sponsor only one other member within the organi- zation; the SPONSOR ID field stores the member identification number of  the member acting as a sponsor. Because the SPONSOR ID field draws its  values exclusively from the MEMBER ID field, it acts as the foreign key  for the relationship. You establish the relationship by officially desig- nating the SPONSOR ID field as the foreign key and notating it as such in  the relationship diagram. Figure 10.45 shows the revised relationship  diagram for the MEMBERS table.  Members  Member ID MbrFirst Name MbrLast Name MbrStreet Address MbrCity MbrState MbrZipcode MbrPhone Number Status Date Enrolled Sponsor ID  PK  FK  Figure 10.45  Establishing the self-referencing one-to-one relationship for the  MEMBERS table  Now, consider the STAFF table example in Figure 10.46. You may  remember that this table has a self-referencing one-to-many relation- ship because a single staff member can manage one or more other  staff members.  There is currently no means of associating a given staff member to  other staff members within the table; therefore, you must create a new  field that will act as the foreign key and enable you to establish the    360   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  PK  Staff  Staff ID StaffFirst Name StaffLast Name StaffStreet Address StaffCity StaffState StaffZipcode StaffPhone Number Position Date Hired  Staff  Staff ID StaffFirst Name StaffLast Name StaffStreet Address StaffCity StaffState StaffZipcode StaffPhone Number Position Date Hired Manager ID  PK  FK  Figure 10.46  The current structure of the STAFF table  relationship. Let’s assume you create a new foreign key field called MAN- AGER ID that will draw its values exclusively from the STAFF ID field. You  now establish the relationship by officially designating MANAGER ID as  the foreign key and notating it as such in the relationship diagram. Fig- ure 10.47 shows the revised relationship diagram for the STAFF table.  Figure 10.47  The revised STAFF table with the new MANAGER ID foreign key   Establishing Each Relationship   361  You probably noticed that the “one” side of the relationship line points  to the MANAGER ID field and the “many” side of the line points to the  STAFF ID field. This is perfectly acceptable because a manager will  manage one or more staff members, but a given staff member reports  to only one manager.  As you may have intuitively guessed, the “one”  side of the line commonly points to the primary key and the “many”  side to the foreign key.   As you work with self-referencing one-to-one and one-to-many rela- tionships, take a moment and examine each table’s structure care- fully. You’ll occasionally find that you can  or may need to  modify and  improve the existing structure in order to eliminate the relationship. I  know what you’re wondering: “But why would I want to do that?”  Retrieving information from tables with these types of relationships  can be tedious and somewhat difficult.  A discussion of the reasons for  this is, unfortunately, outside the scope of this work.  Additionally, the  very presence of the relationship can indicate the need for new field  and table structures.  Consider the STAFF table once again. Does it occur to you that if there  is a need to track staff members who are managers, there could be a  need to track the departments they manage? If this is true, then there  must be other facets of the departments that you need to track in the  database. You should now conduct a quick interview with the appropri- ate staff members to answer these questions and then take the appro- priate action based on their responses.  Let’s assume you were right and the organization does want to track  departmental data. Figure 10.48 shows one possible approach you  might use to accomplish this task.  These new structures and relationships enable you to track the data  efficiently and will provide a wide variety of information about the  departments.  You will, of course, ensure that the new fields and tables  conform to the various design elements that you’ve learned thus far.    362   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  PK  Staff  Staff ID StaffFirst Name StaffLast Name StaffStreet Address StaffCity StaffState StaffZipcode StaffPhone Number Position Date Hired  Department  PK  Department ID DeptName DeptCategory Maximum Staff Level  Department Staff  Department ID Staff ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Position Section  Figure 10.48  Results of eliminating the self-referencing relationship and adding  new structures to track departmental data  It’s important to note that self-referencing relationships do have their  place within a well-designed database. You should be vigilant, however,  and make certain that each self-referencing relationship does indeed  serve a useful purpose.  Many-to-Many   You use a linking table to establish this type of self-referencing rela- tionship, just as you do with its dual-table counterpart. Establishing  this relationship is slightly different in that the fields you use to build  the linking table come from the same parent table.  Let’s revisit the PARTS table example from Figure 10.24. Recall that  this table has a self-referencing many-to-many relationship because a  particular part can comprise several different component parts, and  that part itself can be a component of other parts. You establish this  relationship as you would any other many-to-many relationship—with  a linking table. There is currently no way to associate a given part to  other parts within the table, so you must create a new field for this    Establishing Each Relationship   363  purpose. Say, for example, that you create a field called COMPONENT  ID. This field will store the part identification number of a part that  serves as a component of a parent part. You can now use the PART ID  and COMPONENT ID fields as the basis for the linking table. For the sake  of our example, we’ll assume that the name of the new linking table  is PART COMPONENTS. Once you’ve created and named the linking  table, be sure to revise the relationship diagram for the PARTS table.  Figure 10.49 shows the results of your work.  Parts  PK  Part ID Part Name Part Description Category Wholesale Price Retail Price  Part Components  Part ID Component ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Figure 10.49  Establishing the self-referencing many-to-many relationship for the  PARTS table  As you can see, the PARTS table now has two distinct one-to-many  relationships with the PART COMPONENTS table. The first relation- ship is established via the PART ID field and the second relationship  is established via the COMPONENT ID field. Figure 10.50 illustrates how  these relationships work. Note that a clamp assembly  Part ID 704   contains three components and is itself a component of a seat assem- bly  Part ID 707  and a frame assembly  Part ID 711 .  Now, use the techniques you’ve just learned to establish all of the  relationships you’ve identified among the tables in the database. Make  absolutely certain you create a diagram for each relationship—you’re  going to add new information to these diagrams as the design process  unfolds further.   364   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Part Name   >  Component ID  Part Components  Parts  Part ID 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711  Top Clamp Bottom Clamp Fastening Bolt Clamp Assembly Saddle Seatpost Seat Assembly Body Tube Front Fork Tube Rear Stay Tube Frame Assembly  ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ...... ......

Remember that you made modifications to the  existing table structures and created several new table structures as  you established the relationships; therefore, you want to make certain  that each table conforms to the Elements of the Ideal Table.  Elements of the Ideal Table   cid:129  It represents a single subject, which can be an object or event.   cid:129  It has a primary key.   cid:129  It does not contain multipart or multivalued fields.   cid:129  It does not contain calculated fields.   cid:129  It does not contain unnecessary duplicate fields.   cid:129  It contains only an absolute minimum amount of redundant  data.   Refining All Foreign Keys   365  When you determine that a table does not comply with the Elements  of the Ideal Table, identify the problem and make the necessary mod- ifications. Then, take the table through the appropriate stages of the  database design process until you return to this point. You shouldn’t  encounter any problems with the tables if you’ve been following proper  procedures thus far.  Refining All Foreign Keys  You now know that a primary key becomes a foreign key when you use  it to establish a relationship between a pair of tables in a one-to-one  or one-to-many relationship. As with any other key that you’ve worked  with so far, a foreign key must comply with a specific set of elements.  These elements are collectively known as the Elements of a Foreign Key.  Elements of a Foreign Key   cid:129  It has the same name as the primary key from which it was cop- ied. You should adhere to this rule unless there is an absolutely compelling reason not to do so.  Review the discussion of the Alias field specification element in Chapter 9, “Field Specifica- tions.” It provides an example of an occasion when you might decide to break this rule.  Consider the relationship diagram in Figure 10.51, and note that the foreign keys have different names than the primary keys to which they refer.  The fact that the names are different poses a problem because you can’t be sure that the foreign keys are truly valid and actually refer to the primary keys. Is EMP  truly equivalent to EMPLOYEE NUMBER? Is “Emp” really a shortened version of “Employee,” or does it mean something else? Why did someone choose to use CLIENT  in the ORDERS table instead of CUSTOMER ID? Is there any difference between the two? Do they store the   366   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  PK  Customers  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address CustCity CustState CustZipcode CustPhone CustEmail Address  Orders  Order Number Client  Order Date Ship Date Emp   PK FK  FK  PK  Employee  Employee Number EmpFirst Name EmpLast Name EmpStreet Address EmpCity EmpState EmpZipcode EmpPhone Number Position Hourly Rate Date Hired  Figure 10.51  Primary keys and foreign keys with mismatched names  same type of data? These are questions you must answer before  you can do anything else with these tables and their respective  relationships.  You could make a relatively reasonable argument that the names  are close enough to assume that the foreign keys are indeed  valid. If there’s any doubt, you could test your assumption by  loading the tables with sample data. You really shouldn’t have to  take the time to do this, however. Imagine having to do this for  15 or 20 relationships; the amount of wasted time adds up.  You won’t have to ask these questions or perform these tests  at all when you adhere to this element. Figure 10.52 shows a  revised version of the diagram that uses the proper foreign key  names. In this case, there is no ambiguity and little doubt that  the foreign keys are appropriate. You can examine this diagram  nine months from now and, with a quick glance, confidently  ascertain the type of relationships between the tables and how  they’re established.

In many cases, the foreign keys are either completely inappropriate or manifest serious data-integrity and relationship-integrity problems. Once I identify the appropriate foreign keys  or revise the existing ones  and ensure that they comply with this particular element, a number of problems disappear.  The only time I can justify and approve of using a different name  for the foreign key field is when I establish a self-referencing rela- tionship for a given table. This is reasonable because the pri- mary key and foreign key both reside within the table  in most  cases , and each must have a unique name.   cid:129   It uses a replica of the field specifications for the primary key from which it was copied. This supports the sixth element of an ideal field, which you learned in Chapter 7  “It retains a majority of its   368   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  properties when it appears in more than one table” . A foreign  key, however, has a few settings in both the General Elements  and Logical Elements categories that are slightly different from  those of its parent primary key.  There are four elements in the General Elements category that you  will modify when you define a field specification for a foreign key.  a.  Specification Type: Because a foreign key is based on an  existing primary key, it inherits a replica of the primary key’s field specifications; therefore, you designate the foreign key’s specification type as “Replica.” This designation helps you ensure that your foreign key specifications are consistent, and reminds you to keep this specification synchronized with the primary key’s specification.  b.  Parent Table: The name of the foreign key’s parent table goes  here.  c.  Source Specification: This is where you indicate the name of  the parent primary key.  Make certain you include the name of the primary key’s parent table as well; this will make it eas- ier for you to find the primary key’s specification should you want to compare it to the foreign key’s specification.   d.  Description: Compose a description that indicates the foreign key’s purpose within the table. Figure 10.53 shows an exam- ple of these modifications for an EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER field serving as a foreign key in an ORDERS table.  You’ll also adjust five elements in the Logical Elements category  for the foreign key field specification.  a.

In terms  of our example, you want to be able to associate a specific  employee with any number of orders. If you set this to “Unique”  instead, you could associate a given employee with one order  only, which would greatly limit his or her sales potential!  In  the case of a one-to-one relationship, however, you’ll designate  this element as “Unique” because you want to associate a sin- gle foreign key value in the child table with only one record in  the parent table.   c.  Values Entered By: Unlike the parent primary key, you  or a user  will enter values into the foreign key; therefore, you set this element to “User.”  d.  Range of Values: You must set this element in such a way that  you  or a user  can enter only existing values from the par- ent primary key.  You’ll learn more about this and see a good example in just a moment.   e.

For example, you might  have mistakenly entered employee ID number “100” for a given  order when you meant to enter “110.”  Figure 10.54 shows an example of these modifications for the  EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER foreign key ﬁeld.

For example, you cannot  enter an invalid EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER into the ORDERS table.  Any EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER you enter into the ORDERS table must  first exist as an EMPLOYEE ID NUMBER in the EMPLOYEES table.  This ensures consistency among the values of both fields in both  tables and helps to establish relationship-level integrity.  Review the foreign keys in each table to make certain that they con- form to the Elements of a Foreign Key, and make the appropriate  modifications to those that fail to do so. You really shouldn’t encounter  any problems if you’ve been faithfully following the design process up  to this point.   372   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Establishing Relationship Characteristics  Now you’ll establish the characteristics of each relationship. These  characteristics indicate what will occur when you delete a record, the  type of participation each table bears within the relationship, and to  what degree each table participates in the relationship.  Defining a Deletion Rule for Each Relationship  The first characteristic you’ll establish for the relationship is a dele- tion rule. This rule determines what your RDBMS should do when  you place a request to delete a given record in the parent table of the  relationship. Deletion rules are crucial to relationship-level integrity  because they help guard against orphaned records, which are records  in the child table that have no relationship whatsoever to any records  in the parent table.  These are the five types of deletion rules you can define and the  actions the RDBMS should take when a given rule is in force.  1. Deny: The RDBMS will not delete the record in the parent table,  but will instead keep the record and designate it as “inactive.”  2. Restrict: The RDBMS will not delete the record in the parent  table if related records exist in the child table. You must have the RDBMS delete all of the related records in the child table before you can have it delete the record in the parent table.  3. Cascade: The RDBMS will take two specific actions: It will  delete the record in the parent table, and it will also automati- cally delete all related records in the child table.  4. Nullify: The RDBMS will delete the record in the parent table  and will then update the foreign key values of related records in the child table to null. If you are going to use this deletion rule, you must modify the foreign key’s field specifications and set the Null Support logical element to “Nulls Allowed.”   Establishing Relationship Characteristics   373  5. Set Default: The RDBMS will delete the record in the parent table and will then update the foreign key values of related records in the child table to the current Default Value logical element setting in the foreign key’s field specifications. Obvi- ously, you must have a setting for the Default Value element in order to use this rule.  Use a Restrict deletion rule as a matter of course and the other rules  as appropriate. The best way to determine which deletion rule is appro- priate for a given relationship is to examine the relationship diagram.  Consider the diagram in Figure 10.56.  Employees  Employee Number Manager ID  PK FK  Customers  Orders  Customer ID  PK  Order Number Customer ID Employee Number  PK FK FK  Order Details  Order Number CPK FK Product NumberCPK FK  Products  Product Number  PK  Figure 10.56  What deletion rule is appropriate for a given relationship?   374   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Select a relationship, look at the diagram, and pose the following question:  When a record in the  name of parent table  table is deleted, what  should happen to related records in the  name of child table  table?  Here the question is framed in a generic manner so that you can  understand the premise behind it. When you pose this question for  a pair of tables in a particular relationship, substitute the phrases  within the parentheses with the appropriate table names. If you’re  working with the relationship between the EMPLOYEES and ORDERS  table, you could pose the question in this manner:  When a record in the EMPLOYEES table is deleted, what should hap- pen to related records in the ORDERS table?  The answer you receive depends on how the organization is using the  data within the tables and will usually indicate which deletion rule  you should use for the relationship.  You can’t delete an employee record; you have to designate the  employee as inactive.  Use a Deny rule.   You can’t delete an employee record if there are related order records.   Use a Restrict rule.   You must first delete the orders associated with the employee from the  ORDERS table and then delete the employee from the EMPLOYEES  table.  Use the Restrict rule.   All orders associated with the employee must be deleted from the  ORDERS table as well.  Use the Cascade rule.   The employee number for all orders associated with the employee  must be deleted.  Use a Nullify rule.   The employee number for all orders associated with the employee  must be reset to the lead salesperson’s employee number.  Use a Set  Default rule.   If you  or the people you’re working with  cannot easily provide an  answer, make note of the relationship and continue with another  relationship. You’ll revisit all of these relationships when you establish    Establishing Relationship Characteristics   375  business rules for the database in Chapter 11, “Business Rules.” For  now, let’s assume you received the first reply and you’re going to use a  Deny rule for the relationship.  Once you’ve identified the type of deletion rule you want to use for the  relationship, designate the rule on the relationship diagram. Use  D   for Deny,  R  for Restrict,  C  for Cascade,  N  for Nullify, and  S  for Set  Default. Place the designation under the connection line of the parent  table. Figure 10.57 shows the revised relationship diagram for the  EMPLOYEES and ORDERS tables.  Employees  Orders  Employee Number Manager ID  PK FK   D   Order Number Customer ID Employee Number  PK FK FK  Figure 10.57  Designating a Deny deletion rule for the relationship between the  EMPLOYEES and ORDERS tables  You always set the deletion rule from the perspective of the parent  table because it is the more important of the two tables within the  relationship. Deleting a record in the parent table will always have  some effect on related records in the child table, but deleting a record  in the child table will have no effect on the related record in the par- ent table.  There is a specific circumstance in which you might want  to establish a Restrict deletion rule for the child table, and you’ll learn  about it in Chapter 11.   The question you use to determine the deletion rule for a self-referenc- ing relationship is just slightly different from the one you just used for  a dual-table relationship:  When a record in the  name of parent table  table is deleted, what  should happen to the foreign key values of the other records that were  related to it?   376   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  If you’re working with the self-referencing relationship for the  EMPLOYEES table, you could pose the question in this manner:  When a record in the EMPLOYEES table is deleted, what should hap- pen to the foreign key values of the other records that were related to  it?  Once again, the reply will usually indicate which deletion rule you  should use for the relationship:  You can’t delete a record for an employee who’s currently managing  other employees.  Use a Restrict rule.   If the employee you want to delete is a manager, you cannot delete his  record until you assign the employees he manages to a different man- ager.  Use the Restrict rule.   If the employee whose record you want to delete is a manager, the  MANAGER ID must be deleted from the record of every employee he cur- rently manages.  Use a Nullify rule.   If the employee whose record you want to delete is a manager, the  MANAGER ID must be reset to the senior manager’s employee number in  the record of every employee he currently manages.  Use a Set Default  rule.   ❖ Note  The Cascade rule is notably absent from this exam- ple because it doesn’t apply to the relationship at all; you don’t want to fire employees just because their manager is leaving the organization. This rule is still a viable option in some instances, so do keep it in mind when you’re establishing deletion rules for other self-referencing relationships.  Say that you received the last reply in the preceding list and have  determined that you’re going to use a Set Default deletion rule for the  relationship. You now complete the process by designating the rule on  the relationship diagram. Figure 10.58 shows the results of your work.   Establishing Relationship Characteristics   377  Employees  Employee Number Manager ID  PK FK   S   Figure 10.58  Designating a Set Default deletion rule for the EMPLOYEES table  self-referencing relationship  Identifying the Type of Participation for  Each Table  When you establish a relationship between a pair of tables, each table  participates in a particular manner. The type of participation you  assign to a given table determines whether a record must exist in that  table before you can enter records into the related table. There are two  types of participation.  1. Mandatory: There must be at least one record in this table before  you can enter any records into the related table.  2. Optional: There is no requirement for any records to exist in this  table before you can enter records into the related table.  You’ll commonly determine the type of participation for most tables later  when you’re defining business rules, although you can quite often estab- lish the type of participation for tables in relationships where the type  of participation for each table is obvious, is a result of common sense,  or is in accordance with some particular set of standards. For example,  consider the one-to-many relationship between the EMPLOYEES and  CUSTOMERS tables in Figure 10.59.  These are slightly different ver- sions of the tables in Figure 10.56.   Assume that each customer must be assigned to a particular  employee. This employee acts as the customer’s account representative    378   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Employees  Customers  Employee Number  PK   D   Customer ID Employee Number  PK FK  Figure 10.59  What type of participation should you assign to each table?  and takes care of all transactions and communications between the  organization and that customer. Although each customer must be  associated with a particular employee, a given employee does not have  to be associated with any customer at all. Many employees perform  other functions within the organization that do not require customer  interaction.  This scenario neither implies nor defines any special circumstances,  but does indicate the manner in which the organization conducts this  part of its business. As such, you can infer the following.   cid:129  You should designate a Mandatory type of participation for the  EMPLOYEES table. This ensures that there is at least one employee for you to assign to a given customer.   cid:129  You should designate an optional type of participation for the CUS- TOMERS table. This allows you to enter any person employed by the organization.  Once you’ve determined the type of participation for each table within  the relationship, designate each table’s participation on the relation- ship diagram. Use a vertical line to represent a Mandatory type of  participation and a circle to represent an optional type of participation.  Figure 10.60 shows the revised relationship diagram for the EMPLOY- EES and CUSTOMERS tables and also demonstrates how you indicate  each type of participation. Note that you place the symbol representing  the type of participation outside the symbol that represents the type of  relationship.   Establishing Relationship Characteristics   379  This line symbolizes a mandatory type of participation for this table.  Employees  Customers  Employee Number  PK   D   Customer ID Employee Number  PK FK  This circle symbolizes an optional type of participation for this table.  Figure 10.60  Designating the type of participation for the EMPLOYEES and  CUSTOMERS tables  The type of participation also applies to a self-referencing relationship,  although in a slightly different manner. Because of the nature of a  self-referencing relationship, you designate the type of participation for  the primary key and foreign key fields in the table. Figure 10.61 shows  a revised relationship diagram for the STAFF table you worked with  earlier in this chapter.  Staff  Staff ID  Manager ID   S   PK  FK  Figure 10.61  Designating the type of participation for the primary and foreign  keys of the STAFF table  In this case, you must have at least one staff member with a valid staff  identification number  the primary key  who can serve as a manager.  Conversely, you need not provide a manager identification number  the    380   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  foreign key  for a brand-new staff member; this person may have just  been hired earlier today and has not yet been assigned to a particular  department or project.  Identifying the Degree of Participation for  Each Table  Now that you’ve determined how each table will participate within the  relationship, you must determine the degree to which each table will  participate. The degree of participation indicates the minimum number  of records that a given table must have associated with a single record  in the related table and the maximum number of records that the table  is allowed to have associated with a single record in the related table.  The factors you use to determine the degree of participation—obvious  circumstances, common sense, or conformance to some set of stan- dards—are the same as those you used to determine the type of par- ticipation. You’ll commonly identify the degree of participation for some  tables now and revisit the remaining tables when you define business  rules for the database.  You use two numbers separated by a comma and enclosed within  parentheses to represent the degree of participation for a given table.  The first number indicates the required minimum number of related  records and the second number indicates the allowable maximum  number of related records. For example, a degree of participation such  as  2,11  indicates that the table must have at least 2 but no more than  11 of its records related to a single record in the other table.  Consider the EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS tables once again. There  is a one-to-many relationship between these tables, which means that  a given customer can be associated with only one employee and a  given employee can be associated with any number of customers.  Yes,  I know; this is the obvious part.  Assume, however, that your organi- zation has just instituted a new policy that focuses sharply on quality    Establishing Relationship Characteristics   381  customer service. In order to ensure that each account representative  can deliver the level of service the organization requires, the policy  stipulates that he cannot be assigned to more than 15 customers at  the same time. Based on this scenario, you can infer that the degree of  participation for the EMPLOYEES table is  1,1  and the degree of par- ticipation for the CUSTOMERS table is  0,15 .  Once you’ve identified the degree of participation for a particular table,  add the information to the relationship diagram. Designate the degree  of participation over the connection line of the appropriate table. Fig- ure 10.62 shows the revised relationship diagram for the EMPLOYEES  and CUSTOMERS tables.  This indicates the minimum and maximum number of  employees to which a customer can be related.  This indicates the minimum and maximum number of customers to which an employee can be related.  Employees  Customers  Employee Number  PK   1,1    D    0,15   Customer ID Employee Number  PK FK  Figure 10.62  Designating the degree of participation for the EMPLOYEES and  CUSTOMERS tables  The degree of participation also applies to a self-referencing relation- ship, although you designate it for the primary key and foreign key  fields in the table, just as you did with the type of participation. Figure  10.63 shows an updated version of the relationship diagram for the  STAFF table that includes the degree of participation information.  STAFF ID has a degree of participation of  0,12  because a manager can  manage up to 12 staff members; a new manager who hasn’t yet been  assigned to a department or project will have no  or 0  staff members    382   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Staff   0,12   Staff ID   1,1    S   Manager ID  PK  FK  Figure 10.63  Designating the degree of participation for the primary and foreign  keys of the STAFF table  to manage. The degree of participation for MANAGER ID is  1,1  because a  given staff member is managed by only one manager.  You can designate an unlimited degree of participation for any table  in a dual-table relationship or key field in a self-referencing relation- ship by using an “N” in place of the second number. For example, the  ORDERS table in Figure 10.64 has an unlimited degree of partici- pation. Although a new customer may have not yet placed an order,  you will allow him to place as many orders as he wishes. Imagine the  impact on your organization’s business if you limited each customer to  35 orders! Your organization would soon be out of business, unless it  could continually and consistently acquire new customers.  Customers  Customer ID Employee Number   1,1    R   PK FK  Orders   0,N   Order Number Customer ID  PK FK  Figure 10.64  Designating an unlimited degree of participation for the ORDERS  table  Your task now is to set the relationship characteristics for every rela- tionship you’ve established thus far. As you complete work on a given  relationship, be sure to update the relationship diagram so that it  reflects the results of your work.   Establishing Relationship Characteristics   383  Verifying Table Relationships with Users and  Management  The very last order of business is to verify the relationships. You can  perform this task relatively easily by using the following checklist.  1. Make sure that you’ve properly identified each relationship.  2. Make certain that you’ve properly established each relationship.  3. Make certain that each foreign key complies with the Elements  4. Make sure that you’ve established an appropriate deletion rule  of a Foreign Key.  for each relationship.  5. Make certain that you’ve identified the proper type of participa-  tion for each table within a dual-table relationship and for the appropriate key fields in a self-referencing relationship.  6. Make certain that you’ve identified the proper degree of partici- pation for each table within a dual-table relationship and for the appropriate key fields in a self-referencing relationship.  If all the relationships check out and everyone you’re working with  agrees to this assessment, you can be confident that the relationships  are sound and ready to be incorporated into views.  A Final Note  The degree to which you can easily implement these three relationship  characteristics depends greatly upon your RDBMS. Most RDBMSs do  not fully or inherently support all of the characteristics, but they do  provide some basic support for the deletion rule and type of partici- pation. In most cases, however, you can use SQL and programming  code to implement these characteristics for any relationship in your  database.   384   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  Relationship-Level Integrity  A relationship attains relationship-level integrity after you’ve verified  that it is properly established and its characteristics are suitably set.  Relationship-level integrity warrants the following.   cid:129  The connection between the two tables  or key fields  in a relation-  ship is sound. You accomplished this by using primary and foreign key fields to establish a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship and a linking table to establish a many-to-many relationship.   cid:129  You can insert new records into each table in a meaningful manner.  You ensured this by designating the appropriate type of partici- pation for each table  or key field  within the relationship.   cid:129  You can delete an existing record without producing any adverse  effects. You guaranteed this by assigning an appropriate deletion rule for the relationship.   cid:129  There is a meaningful limit to the number of records that can be  interrelated within the relationship. You implemented this by des- ignating the appropriate degree of participation for each table  or key field  within the relationship.  As you know, relationship-level integrity is the third component of  overall data integrity.  The first is table-level integrity and the second is  field-level integrity.  You’ll establish the final component of overall data  integrity in the next chapter when you learn how to establish business  rules for the database.  CASE STUDY  It’s now time to identify the relationships that exist for the tables that  appear on the final table list for Mike’s Bikes. You’ve assigned your  assistant, Zachary, to this part of the design process, and he’s cur- rently working with these tables:   Relationship-Level Integrity  385  CUSTOMERS  EMPLOYEES  INVOICES  PRODUCTS  VENDORS  Zachary’s first order of business is to identify the relationships that cur- rently exist between the tables. He decides to meet only with Mike because  there are few tables in this database, and he figures that Mike should be  familiar enough with the tables to help him verify the relationships.  Before Zachary meets with Mike, he creates a table matrix and iden- tifies as many relationships as possible. Figure 10.65 shows his com- pleted matrix.  Customers  Employees  Invoices  Products  Vendors  Customers  Employees  Invoices  Products  Vendors  1:1  1:1  1:N  1:N  1:N  1:N  ?  ?  Figure 10.65  Identifying the relationships among the tables in the Mike’s Bikes  database  Zachary then studies the table matrix closely and uses the appropriate  formula to determine the true relationship between each pair of tables.  Here is what he’s discovered so far.  CUSTOMERS and INVOICES bear a one-to-many relationship.   1:1 + 1:N = 1:N   EMPLOYEES and INVOICES bear a one-to-many relationship.   1:1 + 1:N = 1:N    386   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  PRODUCTS and INVOICES bear a many-to-many relationship.   1:N + 1:N = M:N   Now he diagrams the relationships, places them in a folder, and heads  to Starbucks for his meeting with Mike.  At the meeting, Mike and Zachary work on verifying the relationships.  They both determine that the three relationships are indeed correct,  and then Zachary brings Mike’s attention to the PRODUCTS and   VENDORS tables. He’s not quite sure about the relationship between  them, so he discusses the matter with Mike.  MIKE:   ZACHARY:  “I wanted to ask you about the relationship between the  PRODUCTS and VENDORS tables. Can a single product  be associated with one or more vendors?” “Yes, in a manner of speaking. What I mean is that a  single type of product—such as a bike lock—can be  associated with one or more vendors. But I give each lock  its own product number and treat it as a distinct item,  regardless of the vendor who supplies it. Now, if the true  meaning of your question is whether a single record in  the PRODUCTS table can be associated with one or more  records in the VENDORS table, then the answer is no  because each record in the PRODUCTS table contains a  reference to only one vendor in the VENDORS table.” “I thought as much. In that case, there’s a one-to-many  relationship between the VENDORS and PRODUCTS  tables. I automatically figured that a single vendor could be  associated with many products in the PRODUCTS table.”  ZACHARY:   Zachary now diagrams the one-to-many relationship between the  VENDORS and PRODUCTS tables and continues with the next step.  He establishes each one-to-many relationship by taking a copy of the  primary key from the parent table and incorporating it within the  structure of the child table  where it serves as a foreign key  and then    Relationship-Level Integrity  387  revises the relationship diagram accordingly. Figure 10.66 shows one  of his revised diagrams.  Employees  Invoices  Employee Number  PK  Invoice Number Customer Number Employee Number  PK FK FK  Figure 10.66  The relationship diagram for the EMPLOYEES and INVOICES tables  Now Zachary establishes the many-to-many relationship between  the INVOICES and PRODUCTS tables by creating a new linking table  called INVOICE PRODUCTS. He bases the new table on the INVOICE  NUMBER field from the INVOICES table and the PRODUCT NUMBER field  from the PRODUCTS table. Figure 10.67 shows the revised relationship  diagram for the INVOICES and PRODUCTS tables.

Fortunately, he doesn’t have to make any  modifications because all of the table structures are sound. He now  refines the foreign keys in each table by making certain that each one  complies with the Elements of a Foreign Key. Finally, Zachary modifies  the appropriate items in the General Elements and Logical Elements    388   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  sections of each foreign key’s Field Specifications sheet.

Summary  We opened this chapter with a discussion of the three types of relation- ships that can exist between a particular pair of tables—one-to-one,  one-to-many, and many-to-many. You now know that the one-to-many  relationship is the most common type of dual-table relationship and  that the many-to-many relationship gives rise to problems that must  be resolved. You then learned about a self-referencing relationship,  which is a type of relationship that occurs between the records within  a given table. It is similar to a dual-table relationship in that it can be  one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.  Next, we discussed how to identify the relationships that exist among  the tables in a database. First you learned how to construct and use    390   Chapter 10  Table Relationships  a table matrix, and then you learned how to use associative and con- textual questions to help you identify a given relationship. We then  discussed three formulas you could use to determine the true rela- tionship that exists between the tables in a dual-table relationship or  between the records in a self-referencing relationship.  The chapter continued with a discussion of how relationships are  established. You learned that one-to-one and one-to-many relation- ships are established by using primary keys and foreign keys, and that  many-to-many relationships are established using linking tables. We  then briefly revisited multivalued fields, and you learned how to use  a proper one-to-many relationship to resolve a multivalued field more  efficiently. Next, we discussed self-referencing relationships, and you  now know that you establish them in a very similar manner to dual-ta- ble relationships. You then learned that you must review all of the  table structures and ensure that they still conform to the Elements of  the Ideal Table.  Foreign keys were the next topic of discussion, and you learned that  every foreign key must comply with the Elements of a Foreign Key. You  now know that it can be very important for a foreign key to share the  same name as its parent primary key, that you must modify certain ele- ments of a field specification for a field that serves as a foreign key, and  that a foreign key must draw its values from the parent primary key.  We then discussed relationship characteristics. You learned how to  define a deletion rule for a relationship and that there are four ways  you can define it. Next, you learned how to identify the type of partic- ipation and degree of participation for each table within a dual-table  relationship and for each key field in a self-referencing relationship. As  you now know, you can designate the type of participation as Manda- tory or Optional. You also know that the degree of participation gauges  the minimum and maximum number of interrelated records that can  exist within a given relationship. Finally, you learned that you must    Review Questions  391  verify the relationships with users and management and that you can  use a checklist to accomplish this task.  The chapter closed with a look at relationship-level integrity. You  learned that a relationship attains this type of integrity after you’ve  verified that it is properly established and its characteristics are suit- ably set.  Review Questions  1.

Categories of Business Rules  Defining and Establishing Business Rules  Reviewing the Business Rule Specifications Sheets  Validation Tables  Case Study  Summary  Review Questions  Throughout the database design process, you’ve performed tasks that  helped to establish various levels of data integrity. You’ve established  table-level integrity, field-level integrity, and relationship-level integrity  thus far. In doing so, you’ve ensured that the table and field structures  are sound, that data entered into the fields will be consistent and basi- cally valid, and that relationships are meaningful and properly estab- lished. In this chapter you’ll learn how to establish the final component  of overall data integrity: business rules.  What Are Business Rules?  A business rule is a statement that imposes some form of constraint  on a specific aspect of the database, such as the elements within a   393   394   Chapter 11  Business Rules  field specification for a particular field or the characteristics of a given  relationship. You base a business rule on the way the organization  perceives and uses its data, which you determine from the manner in  which the organization functions or conducts its business.  An important aspect of any design process is making choices. In data- base design, for example, you must choose which data to store in the  database; you would not necessarily want or need to store every last  piece of data the organization might possibly use. The data you finally  choose to store and how you decide to store it will be determined by  the way the organization uses its data. A hospital may wish to store  times of various events to the second, whereas a warehouse requires  only the date for any given event.  To guide these and other choices you’ll be required to make during the  database design process  and later, when you implement the data- base in an RDBMS , you need a formal statement of the organization’s  business rules. These rules will influence a wide variety of database  issues, such as the data you collect and store, the manner in which  you define and establish relationships, the types of information that  the database can provide, and the very security and confidentiality of  the data itself. It is next to impossible to create a generic set of busi- ness rules that could apply to two or more organizations. Each organi- zation has its own data and information requirements and each has its  own unique way of conducting its business; therefore, every organiza- tion needs its own specific set of business rules.  The following statement is an example of a typical business rule:  A SHIP DATE cannot be prior to an ORDER DATE for any given order.  This particular business rule imposes a constraint on the Range of  Values element of the field specifications for a SHIP DATE field. It will  help ensure that the value of SHIP DATE is meaningful within the con- text of a sales order. Without this constraint, you could enter any date    What Are Business Rules?   395  into the field  including one prior to the ORDER DATE , making the SHIP  DATE field’s value absolutely meaningless. The business rule is what  makes the SHIP DATE field’s value contextually meaningful.  Because business rules depend on the manner in which an organiza- tion perceives and uses its data, it is quite possible that a particular  rule can be used by several organizations, but for completely different  reasons.  For example, say that the music department at Bel Air High School is  known far and wide for the quality of musicianship it develops in its  student musicians. The students are able to attain this level of musi- cianship because they’re encouraged to focus their musical studies  and restrict themselves to learning to play no more than two instru- ments. In another part of town, the music department at Lake City  High School  a private school  also imbues its student musicians with  a high quality of musicianship by helping the students focus their  musical studies. The students at this school, however, are restricted to  learning to play no more than two instruments due to school policy;  the school’s inventory of musical instruments is very limited.  Coincidentally, both schools are in the process of designing their own  database. In each case, the school will use the database to support its  daily operations and administrative functions. It so happens that each  database contains the tables shown in Figure 11.1.  Both schools are at the same stage of the database design process and  are currently establishing business rules. As it turns out, each school  is using the following business rule in their respective databases:  A student cannot have more than two instruments checked out at the  same time.  This business rule applies to the degree of participation between  the STUDENTS table and STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table. In this  instance, a single record in the STUDENTS table cannot be associated    396   Chapter 11  Business Rules  PK   1,1    R   Students  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address Social Security Number   1,1    R   PK FK  Instruments  Instrument ID Manufacturer ID Product Line Model Category InstName InstDescription Date Acquired Estimated Value   0,2   Student Instruments  Student ID Instrument ID Check-Out Date Check-In Date  CPK FK CPK FK CPK FK   0,N   Figure 11.1  Tables from the Bel Air High School and Lake City High School  databases  with more than two records in the STUDENT INSTRUMENTS table  where the value of CHECK-IN DATE for each record is null; a null value  in the CHECK-IN DATE field indicates that the instrument is still in the  student’s possession.  The rule does apply to both schools, yet each school requires it for a  different reason. Bel Air High School requires the rule because of the  manner in which its music program has been established, whereas  Lake City High School requires the constraint because of the physi- cal limitations of its instrument inventory. The fact that both schools  developed an identical rule is pure coincidence. This example illus- trates that a business rule is, indeed, based on the way an organiza- tion functions or conducts its business and demonstrates why every  organization must have its own specific set of business rules.  The example also illustrates another issue: You cannot establish  constraints imposed by certain business rules, such as this one,  within the logical design of the database. For instance, there is no  clear way for you to indicate that the CHECK-IN DATE values must be  tested in order to determine whether a student can check out another    What Are Business Rules?   397  instrument. You must instead address and establish the constraint  outside of the logical design of the database. How do you determine  whether you can properly represent a given constraint within this pro- cess? You do so by identifying the type of business rule you’re defining.  Types of Business Rules  There are two major types of business rules: database oriented and  application oriented. Both types of business rules impose some form  of constraint and help enforce and maintain overall data integrity, but  they differ with regard to where and how they are established.  Database-oriented business rules impose constraints that you can  establish within the logical design of the database. You implement a  given constraint by modifying various field specification elements, rela- tionship characteristics, or a combination of the two. The statement  from which you derive the constraint is a database-oriented business  rule if you can meaningfully and clearly establish the constraint by  either of these means. For example, say you have a VENDORS table  and define the following business rule for the VENDSTATE field in that  table:  We conduct business exclusively with vendors from the Pacific  Northwest.  This business rule limits the values that you can enter into the  VENDSTATE field to WA, OR, ID, and MT. You can establish the business  rule’s constraint in a meaningful manner by modifying the Range of  Values element in the field specifications for the VENDSTATE field.  Figure 11.2 shows the modification.  Application-oriented business rules impose constraints that you cannot  establish within the logical design of the database. You must instead  establish them within the physical design of the database or within the  design of a database application, where they will be more applicable    398   Chapter 11  Business Rules  Logical Elements Key Type:  x  Key Structure: Uniqueness:  Null Support: Values Entered By: Required Value:  Default Value: Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  x  Same Field Other Fields Value Expression  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  Primary  Alternate Composite Unique  x  x  No Nulls System  Yes  Non  Foreign Simple Non-unique  Nulls Allowed User  No  x  x  None ID, MT, OR, WA  Edit Rule:  x  Enter Now, Edits Allowed Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed Enter Later, Edits Allowed  Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed Not Determined At This Time  All All All  All All  All  x  = = =  + +  +  > > >  –  – –  >= >= >=  x x  x  ≠ ≠ ≠  ÷ ÷ ÷  < < <  <= <= <=  Concatenation Concatenation  Concatenation  Figure 11.2  Implementing a constraint imposed by a database-oriented business  rule  and meaningful.  I use the term database application here to refer to  a program written in some RDBMS software that allows people in the  organization to use the database easily and to perform tasks related to  their daily work activities.   Here is an example of a typical application-oriented business rule:  A customer with a “Preferred” status receives a 15% discount on all  purchases.  This business rule determines the amount of discount applied to a  customer’s purchases, based on a particular status. You cannot estab- lish this constraint meaningfully in the logical design for two reasons:  There is no field in which to store the discount amount  the amount    Categories of Business Rules   399  is a result of a calculation, and calculated fields are not allowed in a  table , and there is no way to indicate the criterion used—the custom- er’s status—to determine the discount. This is a rule that you must  establish within the physical design of the database or the design of  the database application.  ❖ Note  The manner in which you actually define and establish application-oriented business rules is a topic that is beyond the scope of this book. Some RDBMSs provide tools that allow you to implement common application-oriented business rules relatively easily; most RDBMSs will require you to write programming code to implement and enforce these rules.  Although both types of business rules are important, you’ll focus on  database-oriented business rules during this stage of the database  design process.  ❖ Note  Throughout the remainder of the book, I’ll refer to  database-oriented business rules simply as business rules.  Categories of Business Rules  It will be easier for you to understand and define business rules if you  divide them into two distinct categories: field specific and relationship  specific.  Field-Specific Business Rules  Business rules under this category impose constraints on the elements  of a field specification for a particular field. The number of elements    400   Chapter 11  Business Rules  a given rule affects depends on the manner in which you define that  rule. For example, this rule only affects one element:  Order dates are to be displayed in long form, such as “January 10,  2012.”  This rule affects the Display Format element of the ORDER DATE field in  an ORDERS table. You establish this rule by modifying the Display  Format element of the field specifications for the ORDER DATE field to  indicate the manner in which the date should be displayed.  Here’s a rule that affects more than one element:  We must be able to store a zip code for our Canadian customers.  This rule affects the Data Type, Character Support, and Display For- mat elements of the field specifications for the CUSTZIPCODE field in a  CUSTOMERS table. Canadian zip codes include letters, so you must  make the following modifications to these elements in order to impose  the constraints defined by this rule.  1. Change the Data Type setting to “Alphanumeric.”  2.  Include “Letters” under the Character Support element.  3. Modify the Display Format element to ensure that the letters in  Canadian zip codes will be capitalized.  Figure 11.3 shows the modified Physical Elements section of   CUSTZIPCODE’s field specifications.

For instance, assume you’re working with  the tables and relationships in Figure 11.4.   1,1    R   Students  PK  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address Social Security Number   1,1    R   Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  Student Classes   0,N   Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK   0,N   Figure 11.4  Tables and relationships from a school database  Say you determine that there must be a limit to the number of stu- dents for each class and you define the following business rule:  Each class must have a minimum of five students, but cannot have  more than 20.  This business rule affects the degree of participation between the  CLASSES and STUDENT CLASSES tables. You enforce the constraint  this rule defines by modifying the relationship diagram to show that a  single record in the CLASSES table must be related to at least five—but  no more than 20—records in the STUDENT CLASSES table.  Depend- ing on your point of view, you could also infer from this business rule  that the type of participation for the STUDENT CLASSES table is now  mandatory. You can enter a new class or keep an existing class in the  CLASSES table if and only if there are at least five students registered  for that class.  Figure 11.5 shows the modification you must make to  the diagram in order to establish the business rule.   402   Chapter 11  Business Rules  Modification made to the Degree of Participation for  the CLASSES table   1,1    R   Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  Student Classes   0,N   Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK   5,20   PK   1,1    R   Students  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address Social Security Number  Figure 11.5  Establishing a relationship-specific business rule  Defining and Establishing Business  Rules  You’ll define and establish business rules for the database during this  stage of the design process. Remember that you must base these rules  on the manner in which your organization perceives and uses its data,  which  as you well know  will depend on the way the organization  functions or conducts its business. The best approach to this task is  to define and establish the field-specific business rules first, followed  by the relationship-specific business rules. This approach helps you  to remain focused on the type of rule you’re defining. It also keeps you  from jumping back and forth between different types of business rules,  which can often lead to confusion and some amount of frustration.  Working with Users and Management  Once again, you’ll work with the representative group of users and  management. Schedule new meetings with them so that you can work    Defining and Establishing Business Rules   403  together to define and establish the appropriate business rules for  the database. Working as a group enables you to make certain that  the constraints imposed by the business rules you define are mean- ingful and that there is no confusion or ambiguity as to the necessity  of imposing each constraint. If you or anyone in the group has some  doubt about a constraint, you can discuss the effect it will have on the  field or relationship involved and the advantages and disadvantages of  imposing the constraint. You can then decide whether to keep the rule  or disregard it completely based on the results of your discussion.  Defining and Establishing Field-Specific Business  Rules  Begin the process of establishing business rules for the database by  working on field-specific rules. You define and establish each rule  using these steps.  1. Select a table.  constraints.  2. Review each field and determine whether it requires any  3. Define the necessary business rules for the field.  4. Establish the rules by modifying the appropriate field specifica-  tion elements.  5. Determine what actions test the rule.  6. Record the rule on a Business Rule Specifications sheet.  Let’s now take a look at each step in greater detail.  Step 1: Select a Table  It doesn’t matter which table you select first because you’ll eventually  apply this procedure to every table within the database. If you choose  a table with a familiar structure, however, you can focus a little more    404   Chapter 11  Business Rules  on learning the steps within the procedure. This extra effort will pay  dividends when you begin to work with tables containing fields that  bear closer attention and examination.  Think about the subject the table represents and then pose these  questions:  How does the organization use information based on or related to this  subject?  What relationships does this table have to itself or to other tables in  the database?  When necessary, consult the final table list and read the description  for this table, and refer to any relationship diagrams that incorporate  this table. The answers to these questions will be useful to you while  you’re defining rules for this table and focusing on the table in this  manner prepares you for the next step.  Step 2: Review Each Field and Determine Whether It  Requires Any Constraints  Examine the Field Specifications sheet for each field and determine  whether you should apply a constraint to any of its elements. Keep  the questions from Step 1 in mind as you review a given specification  sheet, and then pose this question:  Based on how the table is used within the database, is a constraint  necessary for any element within this specification?  If the answer is no, move on to the next field; otherwise, go on to the  next step. For example, assume you’re working with the CUSTCOUNTY  field in a CUSTOMERS table and you have just posed the question  about the need for a constraint.  Figure 11.6 shows the current Logical  Elements category for this field.    Defining and Establishing Business Rules   405  Logical Elements Key Type:  x  Key Structure: Uniqueness:  Null Support: Values Entered By: Required Value:  Default Value:  Non  Foreign Simple Non-unique  Nulls Allowed User  x x x x None  No  Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  King, Kitsap  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields Value Expression  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  x  x x  All All All  All All  All  x  = = =  + +  +  Primary  Alternate Composite Unique  No Nulls System  Yes  Edit Rule:  Enter Now, Edits Allowed Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed Enter Later, Edits Allowed  x x  Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed Not Determined At This Time  > > >  –  – –  >= >= >=  x x  x  ≠ ≠ ≠  ÷ ÷ ÷  < < <  <= <= <=  Concatenation Concatenation  Concatenation  x x  Figure 11.6  Current settings for the Logical Elements category of the CUSTCOUNTY  field  You should move on to the next step if you receive an answer such as  this:  “Well, the boss wants to begin tracking our customers by county, so  we must make certain we record a county for every customer. In fact,  we’ve just added Pierce County and Snohomish County to our sales  region, so it’ll be imperative that the county names get recorded.”  This response clearly is a yes, so you will go on to define business  rules for this field in the next step.  Step 3: Define the Necessary Business Rules for the Field  You define the appropriate business rules for the CUSTCOUNTY field by  identifying the constraints implied by the response in Step 2. Then you  transform each constraint into a rule.   406   Chapter 11  Business Rules  The response in Step 2 suggests two possible constraints that you  should impose upon the CUSTCOUNTY field: A county name is required  for each customer, and the range of values for this field is limited to  four specific counties  the two currently on the field specification and  the two new counties indicated in the response . Here are two state- ments you might use to begin transforming these constraints into  business rules:  A county must be associated with each customer.  The only counties that can be entered into this field are King, Kitsap,  Pierce, and Snohomish.  Once you’ve defined the appropriate business rules, you can move on  to Step 4.  Step 4: Establish the Rules by Modifying the Appropriate  Field Specification Elements  Establish each business rule you defined in Step 3 by modifying the  appropriate elements on the Field Specifications sheet.  Remember  that some rules may affect more than one element.  First, however, you  must identify which elements of the field specifications the rule affects.  For example, consider the first business rule you defined for the Cust- County field in Step 3:  A county must be associated with each customer.  You can deduce that the rule affects the Required Value, Null Support,  and Edit Rule elements because it explicitly states that a county “must  be associated” with a customer. Now you can make the appropriate  modifications to these elements. In this particular case, you’ll set  Required Value to “Yes,” Null Support to “No Nulls,” and Edit Rule to  “Enter Now, Edits Allowed.”  As you can see, it’s important for you to examine each business rule  very carefully in order to determine which field specification elements    Defining and Establishing Business Rules   407  it’s going to affect. When you first begin to define business rules, it’s  best to have a Field Specifications sheet handy so that you can refer to  it as necessary. Many of the elements will come to mind more easily as  you become more experienced at establishing business rules.  Now, consider the next business rule in the example:  The only counties that can be entered into this field are King, Kitsap,  Pierce, and Snohomish.  This business rule affects the Range of Values element, and you’ll now  revise its setting to “King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish.” Figure 11.7  shows the revised Logical Elements category of the Field Specifications  sheet for the CUSTCOUNTY field.  Logical Elements Key Type:  x  Non  Key Structure: Uniqueness:  Null Support: Values Entered By: Required Value:  Default Value:  Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields Value Expression  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  x  x x  Primary  Alternate Composite Unique  x  x  No Nulls System  Yes  Foreign Simple Non-unique  Nulls Allowed User  x  x  No  None  King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish  Edit Rule:  x  Enter Now, Edits Allowed Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed Enter Later, Edits Allowed  Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed Not Determined At This Time  All All All  All All  All  x  = = =  + +  +  > > >  –  – –  >= >= >=  x x  x  ≠ ≠ ≠  ÷ ÷ ÷  < < <  <= <= <=  Concatenation Concatenation  Concatenation  x x  Figure 11.7  Revised settings for the Logical Elements category of the CUSTCOUNTY  field   408   Chapter 11  Business Rules  Step 5: Determine What Actions Test the Rule  The constraint the business rule imposes is tested when you attempt  to perform one of three actions: inserting a record into the table or an  entry into a field, deleting a record from the table or a value within a  field, or updating a field’s value. Now that you’ve established a business  rule and understand the constraint it will impose, determine what  actions test the rule by identifying when a violation of the rule is most  likely to occur. You can make this a relatively easy task by asking  yourself the following questions:  Will this rule be violated if I enter a new record into this table?  Will this rule be violated if I do not enter a new record into this table?  Will this rule be violated if I delete a record from this table?  Will this rule be violated if I enter a value into this field?  Will this rule be violated if I do not enter a value into this field?  Will this rule be violated if I update the value of this field?  Will this rule be violated if I delete the value of this field?  Once you’ve determined which actions will trigger a violation of the  rule, make note of them; you’ll use them in the next step. This infor- mation will also help you to establish this rule in the most effective  manner possible when you implement the database in your RDBMS.  In this case, the business rule for the CUSTCOUNTY field will be tested  when you try to insert a value into the field because the value must be  within a specific range of values. The rule will also be tested when you  try to delete a value in the field because the value cannot be null.  Step 6: Record the Rule on a Business Rule Specifications  Sheet  You can document a given business rule for future reference by filling  out a Business Rule Specifications sheet. This is something you should    Defining and Establishing Business Rules   409  do for every rule, regardless of its type or category. The Business Rule  Specifications sheet provides three advantages.  1.  2.  3.  It allows you to document every database-oriented business rule. This helps you ensure that you have appropriately defined and properly established each rule.  It allows you to document every application-oriented business rule. Although you cannot establish this type of rule within the logical design of the database, you can at least indicate its basic elements. The information you document for this type of busi- ness rule will prove invaluable to you when you implement the database within your RDBMS or when you create the applica- tion program that people will use to work with the database.  It provides a standard method for recording all business rules. Business rules are easier to track and maintain if you record them in a consistent manner. Using a uniform format also makes it easier for you to troubleshoot business rules; every aspect of the rule appears on the specification sheet.  The Business Rule Specifications sheet contains the following items.   cid:129  Statement: This is the text of the business rule itself. It should be  clear and succinct and should convey the required constraints without any confusion or ambiguity. Here’s an example of a well- framed statement:  A booking agent cannot be assigned to more than 25 entertainers.   cid:129  Constraint: This is a brief explanation of how the constraint  applies to the tables and fields. For instance, you can use the following explanation for the constraint imposed by the business rule in the preceding example:  A single record in the AGENTS table can be associated with no more than 25 records in the ENTERTAINERS table.   410   Chapter 11  Business Rules   cid:129  Type: Here is where you indicate whether the rule is database  oriented or application oriented.   cid:129  Category: This is where you indicate whether the rule is field spe-  cific or relationship specific.   cid:129  Test On: Here is where you indicate which actions  insert, delete,  update  will test the constraint the business rule imposes.   cid:129  Structures Affected: Depending on the type of business rule, the  constraint will affect either a field or a relationship. This is where you designate the name of the field s  the rule will affect or the name of the table s  involved in the relationship that the rule affects.   cid:129  Field Elements Affected: A business rule that pertains to a field  can affect one or more elements of that field’s specifications. This is where you indicate the elements the rule affects.   cid:129  Relationship Characteristics Affected: A business rule that per-  tains to a relationship will affect one or more of the relationship’s characteristics. Here is where you indicate the characteristics that the rule affects.   cid:129  Action Taken: Here you indicate the modifications you’ve made to the elements of a field specification or to a relationship diagram. It is very important that the statement you enter here be as clear and unambiguous as possible. Should a problem occur as a result of enforcing this business rule, this statement serves as accurate documentation of the steps you have taken to establish the rule. You can use this statement to make certain that these steps were actually carried out and that the rule has been prop- erly established.  Now, fill out a Business Rule Specifications sheet for the rule you  established in Step 4. Figure 11.8 shows a completed Business Rule  Specifications sheet that documents the business rules you estab- lished for the CUSTCOUNTY field.

Now, let’s take a look at each step in more detail.  ❖ Note  You can apply this entire procedure to both self-refer- encing and dual-table relationships. I’ve based the remainder of the discussion on a dual-table relationship, however, because it is the type of relationship you are likely to work with the major- ity of the time.  Step 1: Select a Relationship  Which relationship you choose is a relatively trivial matter because  you’ll eventually apply this procedure to every relationship anyway.  Once you select a specific relationship, review its relationship diagram.  Then think about what the tables represent and why they are related  and pose the following questions:   Defining and Establishing Business Rules   413  What kind of information do these tables provide?  Why is the relationship between these two tables important?  The answer to these questions will help you define any necessary busi- ness rules for the relationship, and keeping them in mind will prepare  you for the next step.  Step 2: Review the Relationship and Determine Whether It  Requires Any Constraints  Briefly review each relationship characteristic and keep its current  setting in mind. Then examine the relationship as a whole and deter- mine whether it requires some form of constraint. As you review the  relationship, remember the answers to the questions you posed in  Step 1. You now pose a question such as this to help you determine  whether a constraint is necessary:  Is there a need to impose some type of limitation on this relationship  based on the way the organization functions or conducts its business?  If the answer is yes, then go to the next step; otherwise, review the  next relationship and perform this step once again. For example,  assume you’re designing a database for a small dance studio, and  you’re working with the relationship between the INSTRUCTORS and  INSTRUCTOR CLASSES tables in Figure 11.9.  Now, pose a question to help you determine whether the relationship  requires a constraint:  Is there a need to impose some type of limitation on this relationship  based on the way the dance studio functions or conducts its business?  Move to the next step if you receive an answer such as this:  Yes, there is. We require all instructors to teach at least one class. We  limit them, however, to teaching no more than eight classes.  You’ll use this response as the basis of a business rule in the next step.   414   Chapter 11  Business Rules  PK   1,1    R   Instructors  Instructor ID InstFirst Name InstLast Name InstStreet Address InstCity InstState InstZipcode InstHome Phone InstEmail Address Date Hired  Instructor Classes   0,N   Instructor ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK   0,N    1,1    R   Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Category  PK  Figure 11.9  A relationship diagram for tables from a dance studio database  Step 3: Define the Necessary Business Rules for the  Relationship  Next, define an appropriate business rule based on the response you  received in Step 2. Identify the constraint the response implies and  then transform it into a business rule. For example, you can infer two  constraints from the response: The minimum number of classes an  instructor can teach is one, and the maximum number is eight. Trans- form these constraints into a business rule by composing a statement  such as this one:  An instructor must teach one class, but no more than eight classes.  After you’ve defined the rule, continue with the next step.  Step 4: Establish the Rule by Modifying the Appropriate  Relationship Characteristics  Establish the business rule you just defined by modifying the appro- priate characteristics in the relationship diagram. Before you make  any modifications, consider the business rule statement once again  and identify which relationship characteristics the rule affects:  An instructor must teach one class, but no more than eight classes.   Defining and Establishing Business Rules   415  The constraint affects the number of classes an instructor can  teach, so you modify the degree of participation characteristic of the  INSTRUCTOR CLASSES table by setting it to “ 1,8 .” This rule also  affects the type of participation characteristic of the INSTRUCTOR  CLASSES table. You must set the table’s type of participation to “Man- datory” because a single record in the INSTRUCTORS table must be  associated with at least one record in the INSTRUCTOR CLASSES  table. Figure 11.10 shows the revised relationship diagram with your  modifications.  Modification made to the  Degree of Participation for the  INSTRUCTOR CLASSES table  PK   1,1    R   Instructors  Instructor ID InstFirst Name InstLast Name InstStreet Address InstCity InstState InstZipcode InstHome Phone InstEmail Address Date Hired  Instructor Classes   1,8   Instructor ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK   0,N    1,1    R   Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Category  PK  Modification made to the  Type of Participation for the  INSTRUCTOR CLASSES table  Figure 11.10  The revised relationship diagram that establishes the new busi- ness rule  Step 5: Determine What Actions Will Test the Rule  As you know, the constraint the business rule imposes is tested when  you attempt to insert, delete, or update a table record or field value.  Now that you’ve established the business rule and understand how it    416   Chapter 11  Business Rules  affects the relationship, determine what actions test the rule by iden- tifying when a violation of the rule is most likely to occur. Use the  following questions to help you make your decision:  Are there circumstances under which this rule will be violated if I  enter a new record into this table?  Will this rule be violated if I do not enter a new record into this table?  Will this rule be violated if I delete a record from this table?  Once you’ve determined which actions will trigger a violation of the  rule, make note of them; you’ll use them in the next step. This infor- mation will also help you to establish this rule in the most effective  manner possible when you implement the database in your RDBMS.  Here’s an important point to note: When you determine that a rule  will be violated when you attempt to delete a record, you must alter  the current deletion rule for the relationship accordingly or add a new  deletion rule to the relationship.  You learned in Chapter 10, “Table Relationships,” that you don’t need  to worry about deleting records in the child table of a relationship  because there can be no adverse effects from doing so. We must now  amend this assertion by stating that an exception occurs when delet- ing a record in the child table would violate a required business rule.  You handle this exception by establishing a Restrict deletion rule for  the child table. Make absolutely certain that you keep this in mind as  you’re determining when a rule will be tested.  The new business rule for the dance studio database will be tested  when you attempt to insert a record into the INSTRUCTOR CLASSES  table; you can associate a maximum of only eight records with a  particular instructor. The rule will also be tested when you attempt to  delete a record from the INSTRUCTOR CLASSES table; each instruc- tor must be associated with at least one class. As a result, you must  establish a Restrict deletion rule for this table. Figure 11.11 shows the  modifications you’ve made to this relationship’s diagram.

Figure 11.12 shows the completed Busi- ness Rule Specifications sheet for your new rule.  Validation Tables  As you define field-specific business rules, there will be instances in  which a rule imposes a constraint that defines a distinct set of valid  values for a given field’s range of values.  This affects the field’s Range  of Values element in its field specification.  This set of values commonly  comprises a relatively fixed number of entries, and the values them- selves will rarely change. If the number of entries is rather high, how- ever, you might discover that it’s going to be slightly difficult for you to  implement this rule. For example, you’ll probably run out of room very  quickly when you attempt to enumerate each of the values within the    418   Chapter 11  Business Rules  BUSINESS RULE SPECIFICATIONS  Rule Information  Statement:  An instructor must teach one class, but no more than eight  8  classes.

You can avoid problems such as these by stor- ing all of the values in a validation table.  What Are Validation Tables?  As you learned in Chapter 3, “Terminology,” a validation table  also  known as a lookup table  stores data that you specifically use to  implement data integrity. You won’t often insert, update, or delete any  records within the table once you populate the table with the data you  require. Validation tables usually  but not always  comprise two fields:  The first acts as the primary key and is what you’ll use to help you  enforce data integrity, and the second is simply a non-key field that  stores a set of values required by some other field in the database. Fig- ure 11.13 shows two examples of validation tables.  Non-Key Field  Categories  States  Category ID  Category  State  State Name  60001  60002  60003  60004  Architects  General Contractors  Attorneys  Computer Consultants  AL  AK  AR  CA  Alabama  Alaska  Arkansas  California  Figure 11.13  Examples of validation tables  Primary Key Field   420   Chapter 11  Business Rules  In this section, you’ll learn how to use the primary key field to help  enforce a business rule. You’ll learn how to use the non-key field in  Chapter 12, “Views.”  Using Validation Tables to Support Business Rules  When a business rule limits a field’s range of values, you can enforce  the constraint by using a validation table; the field will then draw its  values from an appropriate field in the validation table. Establishing  this type of rule involves two steps: defining a relationship between the  parent table of the field affected by the rule and the validation table,  and making a modification to the Range of Values element of the field  specifications for the affected field in the parent table.  For example, assume you’re working with the SUPPSTATE field of a   SUPPLIERS table, and you’ve defined the following business rule:  Any supplier we use must be based in one of the 11 contiguous west- ern states, Alaska, or Hawaii.  You can see that this rule imposes a constraint on the SUPPSTATE field’s  range of values, limiting them to AK, AZ, CA, CO, HI, ID, MT, NM, NV,  OR, UT, WA, and WY.  According to the rule, you can’t use a sup- plier based in some other state.  The easiest and most efficient way to  establish this rule is to store these values in a validation table called  STATES, and then to use the validation table as the source of the   SUPPSTATE field’s range of values.  Consider the tables in Figure 11.14.  Note the new symbol that is used  to represent a validation table.  The SUPPLIERS table stores all the  requisite data on the SUPPLIERS engaged by the organization, and the  STATES table is a new validation table that will store the names and  abbreviations of the specified states.  Your first order of business  no pun intended  is to establish a rela- tionship between these tables. As you can see, there is a one-to-many    Validation Tables  421  States  State State Name  PK  Suppliers  PK  Supplier ID SuppName SuppAddress SuppCity SuppState SuppZipcode SuppPhone Number SuppFax Number  Figure 11.14  The SUPPLIERS table and the STATES validation table  relationship between them—a single record in STATES can be asso- ciated with one or more records in SUPPLIERS, but a single record  in SUPPLIERS will be associated with only one record in STATES.  You already know that you establish a one-to-many relationship by  taking a copy of the parent table’s primary key and incorporating it  within the structure of the child table where it becomes a foreign key.  Although the SUPPLIERS table already has a ﬁeld named SUPPSTATE,  you’ll replace it with the STATE ﬁeld from the STATES validation table.   This is a reasonable modiﬁcation because it is in accordance with the  Elements of the Ideal Field and is consistent with the manner in which  you establish one-to-many relationships.  Figure 11.15 shows the new  relationship diagram for these two tables.  Now that the STATE field is a foreign key in the SUPPLIERS table, make  certain that it conforms to the Elements of a Foreign Key  as outlined  in Chapter 10  and set its field specification in the appropriate manner.  Then set the relationship’s characteristics in this manner.   cid:129  Deletion Rule: Define a Restrict deletion rule for this relationship.  You do not want to delete a state in the STATES table that is being referenced by records in the SUPPLIERS table.   422   Chapter 11  Business Rules   1,1    R   States  State State Name  PK  Suppliers  Supplier ID SuppName Supp Address SuppCity State SuppZipcode SuppPhone Number SuppFax Number  PK  FK   0,N   Figure 11.15  A relationship diagram for the SUPPLIERS and STATES tables   cid:129  Type of Participation: Designate an Optional type of participation  for the SUPPLIERS table and a Mandatory type of participation for the STATES table. Although it’s unnecessary for the SUP- PLIERS table to contain any records before you can enter a new record in the STATES table, there must be at least one record in the STATES table before you can enter records into the SUPPLI- ERS table.   cid:129  Degree of Participation: Assign a  1,1  degree of participation for the STATES table; as you already know, there must be at least one record in the STATES table before you can enter records into the SUPPLIERS table. Assign a  0,N  degree of participation for the SUPPLIERS table; any number of records in this table can be associated with a particular record in the STATES table.  Next, modify the Range of Values element of the field specification for  the STATE field in the SUPPLIERS table using a setting such as this:  Any value within the STATE field of the STATES table.  Figure 11.16 shows the settings you’ve made within the Logical Ele- ments category of the Field Specifications sheet for this field.   Validation Tables  423  Logical Elements Key Type:  Key Structure: Uniqueness:  Null Support: Values Entered By: Required Value:  Default Value:  Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  x  x  Same Field Other Fields Value Expression  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  Non  Foreign Simple Non-unique  Nulls Allowed User  x x x  x  No  None  Primary  Alternate Composite Unique  x  x  No Nulls System  Yes  Any value within the State field of the STATES table  Edit Rule:  x  Enter Now, Edits Allowed Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed Enter Later, Edits Allowed  Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed Not Determined At This Time  All All All  All All  All  x  x  = = =  + +  +  > > >  –  – –  >= >= >=  x x  x  =  =  =   ÷ ÷ ÷  < < <  <= <= <=  Concatenation Concatenation  Concatenation  Figure 11.16  Setting the Logical Elements category for the STATE foreign key field  in the SUPPLIERS table  Now you must decide which actions test the rule. When you use a val- idation table to enforce a business rule, you typically want to test the  rule when a user attempts to insert a new value into the field or update  an existing value within the field. In either case, a violation will occur  when the user attempts to enter a value that does not exist in the vali- dation table.  Finally, fill out a Business Rule Specifications sheet for the business  rule you’ve just established. Be sure to indicate the modifications  you’ve made to both the field and the new relationship. Figure 11.17  shows the completed Business Rule Specifications sheet for your new  rule.   424   Chapter 11  Business Rules  BUSINESS RULE SPECIFICATIONS  Rule Information  Statement:  Any supplier we use must be based in one of the 11 contiguous Western states, Alaska, or Hawaii.

Figure 11.17  A completed Business Rule Specifications sheet for the new  business rule   Reviewing the Business Rule Specifications Sheets   425  Reviewing the Business Rule  Specifications Sheets  After you’ve established the business rules you believe to be appropri- ate, review their specification sheets. Carefully examine each speci- fication sheet and make certain that you’ve properly established the  rule and that you’ve clearly marked all of the appropriate areas on  the sheet. If you find an error, make the necessary modifications and  review it once more. Repeat this process until you’ve reviewed every  business rule.  Business rules are an important component of the database. They  contribute to overall data integrity and impose integrity constraints  that are specific to the organization. As you’ve seen, these rules help  to ensure the validity and consistency of the data according to the  manner in which the organization functions or conducts its business.  Additionally, these rules will eventually influence the manner in which  you implement the database within your RDBMS and how you design  and develop end-user application programs for the database.  It’s important to understand that you will revisit these rules quite  often. As you review the final structure, for example, you may deter- mine that additional business rules are necessary. You may discover  that some of the rules will not provide the results you had initially  envisioned, so you’ll need to modify them. It’s also possible for you to  determine that some of the rules aren’t necessary after all.  In this  instance, be absolutely sure to examine the rules carefully before you  remove them.   Keep in mind that the business rules you define now are bound to  require modifications in the future; you will most likely need to add  business rules in due course because of changes in the way the  organization functions or conducts its business. The need to mod- ify existing business rules or develop new ones is quite normal—the  organization inevitably grows and matures, and so does the manner    426   Chapter 11  Business Rules  in which it acts upon or reacts to external forces. These forces affect  the manner in which the organization perceives and uses its data,  which, in turn, changes the nature of the organization’s business rule  requirements.  The task of defining and establishing business rules is—as are so  many other tasks within the database design process—ongoing. Don’t  be discouraged if you have to perform this task several times. Your  efforts will pay great dividends in the long run.  CASE STUDY  Now it’s time to establish business rules for Mike’s database. You  schedule a meeting with Mike and his staff to review the tables and  relationships in their database. The first order of business is to define  and establish field-specific business rules.  You start the process by reviewing the PRODUCTS table. As you  examine each field, you determine whether it requires any constraints.  When you come upon the CATEGORY field, you remember that there was  some question regarding its range of values.  Refer to the Case Study  in Chapter 9, “Field Specifications.”  You discuss this issue once again  with Mike and his staff, and you finally come to a consensus on a  distinct list of categories. Mike then decides that the values for the  CATEGORY field should be limited to those on this list to make certain  that the staff does not arbitrarily invent new categories. Based on  Mike’s decision, you define an appropriate business rule to establish  the constraint:  Invalid product categories are not allowed.  There are a number of items in the list of possible categories, so you  decide that the best way to establish this rule is to use a validation  table. You create a new table called CATEGORIES and then establish  a relationship between it and the PRODUCTS table. Next, you diagram    Reviewing the Business Rule Specifications Sheets   427  the relationship and set the relationship’s characteristics in the appro- priate manner. Figure 11.18 shows the results of your work.   1,1    R   Categories  Category ID CategoryDescription  PK  Products  Product Number ProdName ProdDescription Category ID Wholesale Price Retail Price  PK  FK   0,N   Figure 11.18  The relationship diagram for the PRODUCTS and CATEGORIES  tables  Here are the settings you used for the relationship’s characteristics.   cid:129  There is a Restrict deletion rule for the relationship.   cid:129  The CATEGORIES table has a mandatory type of participation.   cid:129  The PRODUCTS table has an optional type of participation.   cid:129  The CATEGORIES table has a  1,1  degree of participation.   cid:129  The PRODUCTS table has a  0,N  degree of participation.  Remember that by establishing this relationship, you’ve replaced the  existing CATEGORY field in the PRODUCTS table with a copy of the CAT- EGORY ID field from the new CATEGORIES table. You must now make  certain that the CATEGORY ID field in the PRODUCTS table conforms to  the Elements of a Foreign Key and then make the appropriate modifi- cations to its field specification. Finally, set the field’s Range of Values  element to something such as this:  Any value within the CATEGORY ID field in the CATEGORIES table.   Figure 11.19 shows the settings you’ve made to the Logical Elements  category of the field specifications for the CATEGORY ID field in the  PRODUCTS table.   428   Chapter 11  Business Rules  Logical Elements Key Type:  Key Structure: Uniqueness:  Null Support: Values Entered By: Required Value:  Default Value:  Range of Values: Comparisons Allowed:  x  x  Same Field Other Fields Value Expression  Operations Allowed:  Same Field Other Fields  Value Expression  Non  Foreign Simple Non-unique  Nulls Allowed User  x x x  x  No  None  Primary  Alternate Composite Unique  x  x  No Nulls System  Yes  Edit Rule:  x  Enter Now, Edits Allowed Enter Now, Edits Not Allowed Enter Later, Edits Allowed  Enter Later, Edits Not Allowed Not Determined At This Time  Any value within the Category ID field in the CATEGORIES table  All All All  All All  All  x  x  = = =  + +  +  > > >  –  – –  >= >= >=  x x  x  =  =  =   ÷ ÷ ÷  < < <  <= <= <=  Concatenation Concatenation  Concatenation  Figure 11.19  Logical Elements settings for the CATEGORY ID foreign key field in the  PRODUCTS table  Now you must decide when the rule should be tested. As you already  know, you typically want to test a rule established with a validation  table if the user attempts to insert a value into the field or update an  existing value within the field.  Finally, you complete a Business Rule Specifications sheet for this new  business rule. This specification sheet will reflect the modifications  you’ve made to the field specifications for the CATEGORY ID field, as well  as the characteristics of the relationship between the CATEGORIES  and PRODUCTS tables. Figure 11.20 shows the completed Business  Rule Specifications sheet.  You repeat this process for the remaining fields in this table and for  the fields in the remaining tables. After you’re finished, you move on to  the next task.

Figure 11.20  The completed Business Rule Specifications sheet for the new  business rule   430   Chapter 11  Business Rules  The next order of business is to establish relationship-specific business  rules. You begin by reviewing the relatio nship between the EMPLOY- EES and INVOICES tables, and you review the relationship diagram to  determine whether the relationship requires any constraints. Every- thing seems to be in order, so you move to the relationship between the  VENDORS and PRODUCTS tables. Figure 11.21 shows the relationship  diagram for these tables.  Vendors  Vendor ID VendName Vend Address VendCity VendState VendZipcode VendPhone Number VendFax Number  PK   1,1    R    0,N   Products  Product Number ProdName ProdDescription Category ID Vendor ID Wholesale Price Retail Price  PK  FK FK  Figure 11.21  The relationship diagram for the VENDORS and PRODUCTS tables  As you and Mike discuss whether you should impose any constraints  on this relationship, Mike determines that there should be a constraint  on the PRODUCTS table. He wants to make sure that every vendor in  the VENDORS table is associated with at least one product; he figures  that it’s unnecessary to keep data on a vendor who’s not supplying him  with any products. So you define the following business rule for this  constraint:  Every vendor must supply at least one product.  Now you establish the rule by modifying the appropriate relationship  characteristics. You begin by designating a Mandatory type of partici- pation and assigning a  1,N  degree of participation to the PRODUCTS  table. You then define a Restrict deletion rule for the relationship based    Summary  431  on the PRODUCTS table; this will keep you from accidentally deleting  the only product associated with a given vendor. Figure 11.22 shows  the results of your modiﬁcations.

Figure 11.23 shows the completed  speciﬁcation sheet.  Now you repeat this process for the remaining relationships. When  you’re finished, the process is complete and you’re ready for the next  stage of the database design process.  Summary  This chapter opened with a definition of business rules. You learned  that a business rule is a constraint imposed on a field or a relation- ship that is based on the way the organization perceives and uses its  data and that it is derived from the manner in which the organization    432   Chapter 11  Business Rules  BUSINESS RULE SPECIFICATIONS  Rule Information  Statement:  Every vendor must supply at least one product.

You now know that there are  two major types of business rules: database oriented and application  oriented. Although our focus here is on database-oriented business  rules, you know that you can at least record the basic elements of  application-oriented business rules for use later in the implementation  process.  You then learned that database-oriented business rules are divided into  two categories: field-specific business rules, which affect the elements of  a field specification for a particular field; and relationship- specific busi- ness rules, which affect the characteristics of a relationship.  The chapter continued with a discussion of defining and establishing  business rules. Here you learned that you work with users and man- agement to define the business rules required by the organization. You  also learned that it is best to establish the field-specific business rules  first, followed by the relationship-specific business rules.  Next, you learned the steps necessary to define and establish each  type of business rule. You now know that, in general, you work with a  field or relationship, review the field or relationship in light of the rule  to determine whether any constraints are necessary, define the appro- priate business rule, establish the rule by modifying the appropriate  field specification elements or relationship characteristics, decide  which actions test the rule, and then complete a Business Rule Specifi- cations sheet for the rule.  The chapter continued with a discussion of the elements of the Busi- ness Rule Specifications sheet, and how each element on the sheet is  defined. As you now know, using Business Rule Specifications sheets  allows you to document all of your rules and provides you with a stan- dard method for recording and reviewing them.  We closed the chapter by discussing validation tables. You learned that  you can create and use a validation table to support a business rule    434   Chapter 11  Business Rules  that limits the range of values for a particular field. In this manner,  the validation table helps to enforce data integrity. You also learned  that you need to establish new relationships when you use validation  tables and that these relationships have the same types of characteris- tics as any other types of relationships in the database.

Anatomy of a View  Case Study  Summary  Review Questions  What Are Views?  As you learned in Chapter 3, “Terminology,” a view is a virtual table  composed of fields from one or more tables in the database; it can also  include fields from other views. The tables and views that comprise  a given view are known as the view’s base tables. A view is “virtual”  because it draws data from base tables rather than storing data on  its own. In fact, the only information about a view that is stored in  the database is its structure; the RDBMS rebuilds and “repopulates”  the view every time you access the view in some manner. Many major  RDBMS programs support views, but some refer to them as saved que- ries. Your specific RDBMS program will determine whether you refer to  this object as a query or a view.  435   436  Chapter 12  Views  ❖ Note  Although every major database vendor supports the view I’ve just described, several vendors support what is known as an indexed  or materialized  view. An indexed view is different from a regular view in that it does store data, and its fields can be indexed to improve the speed at which the RDBMS processes the view’s data. A full discussion of indexed views is beyond the scope of this book because it is a vendor-specific implementation issue. However, you should research this topic further if you are working with a client server or mainframe RDBMS program.  Views enable you to see the information in your database from many dif- ferent aspects, providing you with a great amount of flexibility when you  work with your data. You can create views in a variety of ways, and they  are especially useful when you base them on multiple related tables.  There are several reasons why you should define and use views in your  database.   cid:129  You can use them to work with data from multiple tables simulta-  neously. During the database design process, you established relationships between various pairs of tables bearing one-to- many or many-to-many relationships to each other.  Recall that you resolved the many-to-many relationships via linking tables.  A view provides the mechanism that allows you to work with data from two or more related tables simultaneously.   cid:129  They reflect the most current information. Because the RDBMS  rebuilds and repopulates the view every time you access it, the information displayed by the view exhibits the most recent changes to the data in its base tables.   cid:129  You can customize them to the specific needs of an individual  or group of individuals. You can build a view to suit any set of requirements, such as providing the data for a particular report   Anatomy of a View   437  or providing a means of examining specific information that is  common to several departments within an organization.   cid:129  You can use them to help enforce data integrity. You can define a validation view that works in the same manner as a validation table—its purpose is to provide a valid range of values for a given field in the database.   cid:129  You can use them for security or confidentiality purposes. You can  determine what data is available to a particular user or group of users by defining a view on select fields from the view’s base tables.  Define your views carefully and skillfully, and they will become a valu- able asset after you’ve implemented the database within your RDBMS.  Anatomy of a View  There are three types of views  data, aggregate, and validation  that  you can define as you design the logical structure of the database and  two types of views  materialized and partitioned  that you can define as  you implement your database within an RDBMS. The ability to define  the latter two types of views and the manner in which you do so are  highly dependent upon your RDBMS, so they are beyond the scope  of this book. We will, therefore, focus our attention on the first three  types of views.  Data View  You use this type of view to examine and manipulate data from a sin- gle base table or multiple base tables.  Single-Table Data View  Although you could use all of the fields from the base table to build  this type of view, you’ll usually just use selected fields.  Building a view    438  Chapter 12  Views  using all of the base table’s fields would simply produce a virtual copy  of the base table.  For example, say you want to make a list of employee  names and phone numbers available to everyone in the organization.  You can construct an EMPLOYEE PHONE LIST view based on the  EMPLOYEES table using just the EMPLOYEE ID, EMPFIRST NAME, EMPLAST  NAME, and EMPPHONE NUMBER fields. Figure 12.1 shows a diagram of this  particular view.  Note the new symbol used to indicate a view.   Employees  PK  Employee ID EmpFirst Name EmpLast Name EmpStreet Address EmpCity EmpState EmpZipcode EmpHome Phone  Employee Phone List  Employee ID EmpFirst Name EmpLast Name EmpPhone Number  Figure 12.1  The EMPLOYEE PHONE LIST view  Your RDBMS will rebuild and repopulate the EMPLOYEE PHONE  LIST view each time you access it, and the view will reflect the latest  changes you’ve made to the data in the EMPLOYEES table. Figure 12.2  shows how an RDBMS will typically display the data within a view.  Note that the view’s appearance is quite similar to that of a table; this  is yet another reason why a view is known as a “virtual table.”   Anatomy of a View   439  Employee Phone List  Employee ID  EmpFirst Name  EmpLast Name  EmpPhone Number  100  101  102  103  104  105  Zachary  Susan  Joe  Alastair  Katie  Diana  Erlich  Black  Rosales  Black  Christian  Price  553-3992  790-3992  551-4993  227-4992  525-2993  248-4953  Figure 12.2  Information from the EMPLOYEE PHONE LIST view  You can modify the data within a single-table data view at any time,  and the modifications you make will flow through the view and into  the base table. Keep in mind, however, that field specifications and  business rules will determine what types of modifications you can  make to the data. For example, you won’t be able to delete a last name  in the EMPLOYEE PHONE LIST view if the Null Support element of the  field specification for the EMPLAST NAME field is set to “No Nulls.”  ❖ Note  View implementation varies to some degree among most RDBMS software. Make sure you examine your RDBMS’s doc- umentation to determine how fully the RDBMS supports views and what types of constraints it imposes  if any  on modifying the data in a view.  Multitable Data View  As I mentioned at the beginning of this section, you can define a data  view using two or more tables. The only requirement is that the tables  you use to create the view must bear a relationship to each other; this  helps ensure that the information the view presents is both valid and  meaningful. For example, assume you’re designing a database for a    440  Chapter 12  Views  local community college and that the tables in Figure 12.3 are part of  the database. You’ve just decided that you need to create a view called  CLASS ROSTER that shows the name of each class and the names of  the students who are currently registered to attend it. This will be an  easy task for you to perform because you can use the three tables as  the basis of the view; they contain the fields that you need to define  the view and they bear a relationship to one another.  PK  Students  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address  Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  Student Classes  Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Figure 12.3  Base tables for the CLASS ROSTER view  Now you define the CLASS ROSTER view by using the CLASS NAME field  from the CLASSES table and the STUDFIRST NAME and STUDLAST NAME  fields from the STUDENTS table. The appropriate student names will  appear for each class because CLASSES and STUDENTS are related   and therefore connected  through the STUDENT CLASSES linking  table. Figure 12.4 shows the diagram for the CLASS ROSTER view.  Note that no changes have been made to any of the base tables.  Every time you access the CLASS ROSTER view, the RDBMS will  rebuild and repopulate it using the most current data from the view’s  base tables. Figure 12.5 shows a sample of the view’s data.  You can modify most of the data within a multitable data view at any  time, and the modifications you make will flow through the view and    Anatomy of a View   441  Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  PK  Students  Student ID StudFirst Name StudLast Name StudStreet Address StudCity StudState StudZipcode StudHome Phone StudEmail Address  Students Classes  Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Class Roster  Class Name StudFirst Name StudLast Name  Figure 12.4  The diagram for the CLASS ROSTER view  Class Name  StudFirst Name  StudLast Name  Class Roster  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Music Theory  Advanced Music Theory  Advanced Music Theory  American History  American History  American History  American History  Martin  Gina  Joe  Sara  Mike  Susan  Lee  Gina  Susan  George  Joe  Applebee  Carter  Rosales  Ulrich  Hernandez  Black  Turner  Carter  Black  Price  Rosales  Figure 12.5  A partial sample of data from the CLASS ROSTER view   442  Chapter 12  Views  into the base tables. Quite obviously, you can’t modify the value of any  primary keys that you incorporate from the base tables. As in the case  of a single-table view, field specifications and business rules will deter- mine what types of modifications you can make to the data.  Again, be  sure to check your RDBMS documentation for any further constraints  it may place upon your views.   The redundant data in the CLASS ROSTER view  which you should  have noticed  is the result of merging a record from the CLASSES  table with two or more records from the STUDENTS table; the number  of times a particular class name appears is equal to the number of  students that are registered to attend that class. This apparent redun- dancy is acceptable because the data is not physically stored in the  view—rather, it is drawn from the view’s base tables, where it is stored  in accordance with the rules of proper database design. RDBMSs com- monly display data from multitable views in this fashion.  Another point to note is that a data view does not contain its own pri- mary key. It lacks a primary key because it is not a table; a true table  stores data and requires a primary key to serve as a unique identifier  for each of its records. You can incorporate a primary key from any  or  all  of the base tables within the view, however, when you determine it  will contribute to the information the view provides.  ❖ Note  In order to avoid any unnecessary ambiguity or confu- sion, make certain you do not have any primary key indicators within the view symbol when you diagram a data view.  Aggregate View  You use this type of view to display information produced by aggregat- ing a particular set of data in a specific manner. As with a data view,  you can define an aggregate view using one or more base tables. You    Anatomy of a View   443  can then include one or more calculated fields that incorporate the  functions that aggregate the data and one or more data fields  drawn  from the view’s base tables  to group the aggregated data. Sum, Aver- age  arithmetic mean , Minimum, Maximum, and Count are the most  common aggregate functions that you can apply to a set of data, and  every major RDBMS supports them.  Let’s say that you wanted to know how many students are registered  for each class, and you’re using the tables from the school example  shown in Figure 12.3. Your first impulse is to define a data view called  CLASS REGISTRATION that will provide the information you need  to answer your question. So, you use the CLASS NAME field from the  CLASSES table and the STUDENT ID field from the STUDENT CLASSES  table to build the view. Figure 12.6 shows a diagram for the new  CLASS REGISTRATION view.  Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  Students Classes  Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Class Registration  Class Name Student ID  Figure 12.6  View diagram for the new CLASS REGISTRATION view   444  Chapter 12  Views  Class Name  Student ID  Class Registration  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Music Theory  Advanced Music Theory  Advanced Music Theory  Business Administration  Business Administration  Business Administration  Business Administration  1003  1025  1073  1110  1045  1066  1085  1025  1066  1017  1073  Figure 12.7  A partial sample of data from the CLASS REGISTRATION view  Now you access the view so that you can answer your question.  Figure 12.7 shows a partial sample of the data in the view.  In order to answer your question, you must now count each instance of  a given class name so that you can determine how many students are  registered for that class. Imagine the work you have ahead of you—this  will not be an easy task! Rather than going through all this tedious  work, you can answer your question quite easily  and more efficiently   using an aggregate view.  There’s no need to define a new view because you can modify the one  you have just now. Remove the STUDENT ID field from the view and  replace it with a calculated field called TOTAL STUDENTS REGISTERED that  counts the number of students per class.  When you work with a cal- culated field, make certain that you give it a name that is meaningful  and that will distinguish it from other calculated fields in the view.   The calculated field will use a Count function to count the number of  STUDENT IDs in the STUDENT CLASSES table that are associated with    Anatomy of a View   445  each CLASS ID in the STUDENT CLASSES table.  Later, you’ll learn  how to document a view and record the expression the calculated field  will use.  Figure 12.8 shows the revised diagram for the CLASS  REGISTRATION view.  Classes  Class ID Class Name Class Description Instructor ID Category  PK  FK  Students Classes  Student ID Class ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Class Registration  Class Name Total Students Registered  Figure 12.8  Revised diagram for the CLASS REGISTRATION view  As was the case with the data view, the RDBMS will rebuild and  repopulate the CLASS REGISTRATION view every time you access it,  using the most current data from the view’s base tables. Figure 12.9  shows a sample of the view’s data.  There are three things to note about this view.  1. The TOTAL STUDENTS REGISTERED field displays a single number for each class name, which represents the total number of students registered for that class.  2. The redundancy within the CLASS NAME field has been elimi-  nated; all instances of a given class name have been grouped   446  Chapter 12  Views  Class Name  Total Students Registered  Class Registration  Advanced Calculus  Advanced Music Theory  Business Administration  Computers in Business  English Literature  Introduction to Biology  Introduction to Database Design  Pan-American Studies  92  80  84  98  80  60  84  80  Figure 12.9  A sample of data from the revised CLASS REGISTRATION view  into a single instance. As a result, CLASS NAME is now a grouping  field, and its values cannot be modified in any way.  ❖ Note  All data fields in an aggregate view are grouping fields.  3. Because an aggregate view is composed entirely of grouping  fields and calculated fields, you cannot modify any of its data.  An aggregate view is most useful as the basis of a report or as a means  of providing various types of statistical information. You’ll learn later  that you can apply filtering criteria to this  or any  view in order to  control and restrict the data that the view displays.  Validation View  A validation view is similar to a validation table in that it can help  implement data integrity. When a business rule limits a particular  field’s range of values, you can enforce the constraint just as easily  with a validation view as you can with a validation table. The differ- ence between the two lies in their construction—a validation table    Anatomy of a View   447  stores its own data, whereas a validation view draws data from its base  tables. Although you can define a validation view using one or more  base tables, you’ll commonly define a validation table using a single  base table and incorporate only two or three of the base table’s fields.   This structure is quite similar to that of a validation table.   For example, let’s say you’re designing a database for a small contrac- tor and you’re working with the tables in Figure 12.10.  Subcontractors  PK  Subcontractor ID  SCName SCStreet Address SCCity SCState SCZipcode SCPhone Number SCEmail  Project Subcontractors  Subcontractor ID Project ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Projects  Project ID Project Name Project Start Date Project End Date Category ID  PK  FK  Figure 12.10  Tables from a database for a small contractor  As you can see, the SUBCONTRACTOR ID field in the SUBCONTRACTORS  table provides the range of values for the SUBCONTRACTOR ID field in the  PROJECT SUBCONTRACTORS table.  Recall that a foreign key draws  its values from the primary key to which it refers.  You’ve determined,  however, that you want to restrict the access users currently have to  certain fields in the SUBCONTRACTORS table; you’ve decided that the  only fields users should be able to access are the SUBCONTRACTOR ID,  SCNAME, SCPHONE NUMBER, and SCEMAIL fields. So, you define a valida- tion view called APPROVED SUBCONTRACTORS that will incorporate  these fields and still provide the range of values for the SUBCONTRAC- TOR ID field in the PROJECT SUBCONTRACTORS table. Figure 12.11  shows a revised diagram of the tables, including the new view.   448  Chapter 12  Views  Approved Subcontractors  PK     I D    r a c t o r  S u b c o n t S C N a m e S C P h o n e   N u m b e r S C E m a i  l  Projects    I D   N a m e t   S t a r   D a t e   E n d   D a t e  P r o j e c t P r o j e c t P r o j e c t P r o j e c t C a t e g o r y    I D  PK  FK  Project Subcontractors  S u b c o n t P r o j e c t    r a c t o r I D     I D  CPK FK CPK FK  Figure 12.11  Revised table diagram; note the new APPROVED  SUBCONTRACTORS view.  The APPROVED SUBCONTRACTORS view now gives users access only  to those fields that you’ve indicated and provides the appropriate range  of values for the SUBCONTRACTOR ID field in the PROJECT SUBCON- TRACTORS table. Additionally, the view will still enforce the rela- tionship characteristics that exist for the SUBCONTRACTORS table  because it  as you will recall  is the view’s base table.  Determining and Defining Views  By now you’ve probably realized that views can be a substantial asset  to the database. During this stage of the database design process,  you’ll define a fundamental set of views for the database. Your defini- tion of views won’t stop here—you’ll probably define more views when  you implement the database within your RDBMS and as you create  your end-user application programs. In these instances, you’ll use  views as a tool to support particular aspects of the implementation or  application program. The views you define during the database design  process, however, will focus strictly on data access and information  retrieval issues.   Determining and Defining Views   449  Working with Users and Management  You’ll work once again with the organization’s representative group of  users and management to identify the types of views the organization  requires. After you identify these views, you’ll establish and document  them, and then you and the group will review the views to make cer- tain that they are properly defined.  Before you conduct your first meeting with the group, review the notes  you’ve taken throughout the entire design process. Your objective is to  get an idea of the types of views the organization might need. Almost  every organization spends a large amount of time producing and  reading reports, so you should focus on that aspect of your notes. You  should also review the report samples you assembled during the anal- ysis process.  When you and the group meet, consider the following points to help  you identify view requirements.   cid:129  Review your notes with the group. In many instances, talking about a specific topic will spark an idea for a new or required view. For example, someone may realize a need for a view during a discussion of mission objectives.   cid:129  Review the data entry, report, and presentation samples you  gathered during the early stages of the design process. Examining these samples, especially summary-style reports, could easily illuminate the need for certain types of views.   cid:129  Examine the tables and the subjects they represent. Some individ-  uals in the group may identify the need for a view based solely on a specific subject. If someone mentions a subject, such as Employees, it may cause someone else to say, “We definitely need a view that restricts certain employee data for confidentiality reasons.”   450  Chapter 12  Views   cid:129  Analyze the table relationships. You’ll most likely identify a num-  ber of multitable views that you should create for many of the relationships. Several of these views will coincide with views you identified for the report samples.   cid:129  Study the business rules. As you already know, you can use a  validation view to enforce a rule that imposes a constraint on a particular field’s range of values.  You and the group should be able to identify a number of views by  going over the items on this list. After you’ve identified as many of the  required views as possible, your next task is to define them.  Defining Views  You’ll now define each view that you’ve identified using the appropriate  tables and fields. Review the relationship diagrams to identify which  tables and fields you need for the view’s structure. When you’ve deter- mined what you need, define the view and record it in a view diagram.  For example, say you’ve determined that you can use a view for  the report shown in Figure 12.12; the name of the new view will be   CUSTOMER CALL LIST.  The notes you’ve taken throughout the design process become useful  once again. You reviewed this report during the analysis stage of the  design process, and you’ve noted that this report represents infor- mation about customers and their orders; it is from the order data  that you can determine when a given customer made his last pur- chase. Now, review the relationship diagram for the CUSTOMERS and  ORDERS tables; you’ll use fields from these tables to create the CUS- TOMER CALL LIST view. Figure 12.13 shows the relationship diagram  for these tables.  After examining the relationship diagram, you determine you need  to use five fields to build this view: CUSTFIRST NAME, CUSTLAST NAME,    Determining and Defining Views   451  City  Bothell  Bellevue  Edmonds  Lynnwood  Customer Call List  Customer Name  Phone Number  Last Purchase  Sara Anderson  Jim Booth  Larry Currey  Jim Davis  Larry Lang  Sandra Wasser  Julia Black  Mary Black  Barbara Reeves  542-0039  367-4495  445-3394  545-9932  545-3384  367-2293  223-9943  562-1274  445-2094  05 16 02  02 11 02  02 06 02  05 10 02  01 22 02  06 30 02  04 12 02  02 28 02  03 07 02  Figure 12.12  Report sample requiring a view  Customers  Orders  PK   1,1    R    0,N   Order Number Customer ID  Order Date Ship Date  Employee ID  PK FK  FK  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address  CustCIty CustState CustZipcode CustPhone Number Status  Figure 12.13  Relationship diagram for the CUSTOMERS and ORDERS tables   452  Chapter 12  Views  CUSTPHONE NUMBER, and CUSTCITY from the CUSTOMERS table, and  ORDER DATE from the ORDERS table. You now define the CUSTOMER  CALL LIST view by assigning the fields to the view and then recording  them in a view diagram. When you’re finished, your diagram should  look like the one in Figure 12.14.  Customers  Orders  PK   1,1    R    0,N   Order Number Customer ID  Order Date Ship Date  Employee ID  PK FK  FK  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address  CustCIty CustState CustZipcode CustPhone Number Status  Customer Call LIst  CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustPhone Number CustCity Order Date  Figure 12.14  View diagram for the CUSTOMER CALL LIST view  Using Calculated Fields Where Appropriate  Earlier in the database design process, you learned that tables couldn’t  contain calculated fields for a number of good reasons. But one of the  characteristics of a view that makes it so useful is that it can contain    Determining and Defining Views   453  calculated fields. Recall that calculated fields will display the result of  a concatenation, expression, or aggregate function; this makes them  an extremely flexible structure to include in a view.  For example, consider the new CUSTOMER CALL LIST view. Although  you have the fields you need for the view, you’ll have to make one  minor modification to the view so that it can display the appropriate  data. One of the requirements for this view is that it must display the  date of the last purchase made by each customer. In order to retrieve  and display the proper date, you’ll have to add a calculated field to the  view. This field will use the Maximum function [commonly known as  Max   ] to retrieve the correct date from the ORDER DATE field. Name the  new field LAST PURCHASE DATE and add it to the CUSTOMER CALL LIST  view diagram.  You no longer need the ORDER DATE field in the view, so  you can remove it from the view’s structure.  This is the expression  you’ll use in the calculated field to retrieve the appropriate date:  Max Order Date   Later in this section, you’ll learn where and how to record this  expression.  ❖ Note  Be sure to refer to your RDMBS’s documentation to determine the correct syntax for this function and all of the other functions used in this chapter.  Another calculated field you might include in this view is one that  displays the complete customer name by concatenating CUSTFIRST NAME  and CUSTLAST NAME. Say, for example, that you want to display the  customer name in this manner: “Hernandez, Michael.” Create a calcu- lated field called CUSTOMER NAME and use the following concatenation  expression:  CustLast Name & “, “ & CustFirst Name   454  Chapter 12  Views  Add the new calculated field to the CUSTOMER CALL LIST view dia- gram and remove the CUSTFIRST NAME and CUSTLAST NAME fields from the  view; you don’t need these fields anymore because you’re now using  the CUSTOMER NAME calculated field.  You’ll soon properly record this  expression as well.   Figure 12.15 shows how your revised view diagram should look after  you’ve completed these modifications.  Customers  Orders  PK   1,1    R    0,N   Order Number Customer ID  Order Date Ship Date  Employee ID  PK FK  FK  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address  CustCity CustState CustZipcode CustPhone Number Status  Customer Call LIst  Customer Name  Customer Phone Number  CustCity  Last Purchase Date  Figure 12.15  Revised view diagram for the CUSTOMER CALL LIST  As you’ve just learned, a calculated field can be quite an asset because  you can use it to enhance the information a view provides. You also  learned earlier in this chapter that calculated fields are particularly    Determining and Defining Views   455  crucial in aggregate views. A good rule of thumb to follow when you  think you may need calculated fields is to use them if they will provide  pertinent and meaningful information or if they will enhance the man- ner in which the view uses its data.  If you recall, you created a calculated field list earlier in the design  process  refer to Chapter 6, “Analyzing the Current Database” . You  can now use this list as a source of calculated fields that you might  or  should  use in your views. Review the list as you define each new view  and determine whether you can use one of the calculated fields on the  list. When you find one that you can use, create it in the same manner  as you did in the preceding examples.  If you create a new calculated  field that does not appear on your list, however, be sure to add it to the  list. This will help you keep your calculated field list current and in  order.   Imposing Criteria to Filter the Data  Views have another characteristic that makes them extremely useful:  You can impose criteria against one or more fields in the view to filter  the records it displays. For example, say that the CUSTOMER CALL  LIST view included the CUSTSTATE field. Although the view would con- tinue to display the set of records it did before, you would also see the  state in which each customer lives. Assume, however, that you want  the view to show a particular set of records, such as those for cus- tomers who live in Washington. You can accomplish this by setting a  specific criterion on the CUSTSTATE field that will filter the data so that  the view displays only those records of customers from Washington.  ❖ Note  In database work, the word criterion refers to an expres- sion that is tested against the value of a particular field. The view will include a given record if the value of the field meets the criterion.   456  Chapter 12  Views  This is the expression you will use to filter the records for the   CUSTOMER CALL LIST view:  CustState = “WA”  Now the view will display only customers from Washington. If you want  to filter the records further to show only those customers who live in  specific cities, you add a criterion such as this:  CustCity In  “Bellevue,” “Olympia,” “Redmond,” “Seattle,”  “Spokane,” “Tacoma”   The view will now display Washington customers who live in the  cities specified in the expression. You may wonder why both criteria  are necessary—the criterion for the CUSTCITY field should retrieve the  appropriate records by itself. The trouble is that many cities are named  for other cities, so cities in two or three different states could have the  same name. For example, there is a Portland, Oregon, and a Portland,  Maine, both named after Portland, England. The point to remember is  that you must use your best judgment when you establish criteria for a  view—use the minimum number of criteria that will cause the view to  display the records you require.  When you use a criterion in a view, you must make certain that the  field you’re testing in the criterion is included in the view’s structure.  If you do not include the field in the view, you have no way of imposing  the criterion. This is an important point to remember because it is a  requirement when you logically define a view and when you implement  the view in your RDBMS.  The one problem with applying a filter to a view is that there is no way  to indicate it on a view diagram; therefore, you must record it on a  View Specifications sheet.   Determining and Defining Views   457  Using a View Specifications Sheet to Record the View  A View Specifications sheet must accompany each view diagram you  create. It is on this sheet that you will record the characteristics of the  view. The View Specifications sheet contains the following items.   cid:129  Name: This is where you indicate the name of the view. Before you record the name, however, test it against the guidelines for creating table names you learned in Chapter 7, “Establishing Table Structures.” These guidelines govern the naming of views as well, with one exception: The name of a view can implicitly or explicitly identify more than one subject. This is because you can define views from two or more base tables, so they do, indeed, represent more than one subject.   cid:129  Type: This is where you indicate whether you’re defining a data,  aggregate, or validation view.   cid:129  Base tables: This is where you specify the names of the view’s  base tables. Although the view diagram shows these tables, they appear here as a matter of convenience. The View Specifications sheet does not include field names, however, because you can record and display them more easily and efficiently on the view diagram.   cid:129  Calculated field expressions: This is where you record the expres-  sions for the calculated fields you included in the view. As you record the name of the calculated field, test it against the guide- lines for creating field names you learned in Chapter 7. Cal- culated field names are governed by these guidelines with two exceptions: You can implicitly or explicitly identify more than one characteristic in a name, and you can use the plural form of the name. But it’s still desirable to use the singular form of the name whenever possible.   458  Chapter 12  Views   cid:129  Filters: This is where you record the criteria that the view will use  to filter the records it displays. You’ll record both the field being tested and the expression used to test it.  ❖ Note  When you fill out the Calculated Field Expressions and Filters sections of a View Specifications sheet, use the expres- sions with which you are most familiar. You’ll modify them as necessary when you implement the database in an RDBMS.  Fill out a View Specifications sheet for each view that you create, and  attach the sheet to the proper view diagram. Both of these items will  serve to document the view fully. Figure 12.16 shows a completed View  Specifications sheet for the CUSTOMER CALL LIST view.  Keep in  mind that the view has been updated to include the CUSTSTATE field.   Reviewing the Documentation for Each View  Once you’ve completed the task of defining and documenting each  view, review all of your views once more—ensuring that the quality  of the information each view provides is well worth the effort. As you  review each view, keep the following points in mind.   cid:129  Make certain that you’ve defined the view properly. Think about  the information the view should provide. Are you establishing the correct type of view for the required information? Did you use the appropriate base tables to define the view? Did you include all the necessary fields within the view’s structure? Are only the necessary fields included in the view’s structure?   cid:129  Make certain that the calculated fields you’ve created are suitable for the view. Do they provide pertinent and meaningful informa- tion? Do they serve to enhance the manner in which the view displays its data?

First  of all, do you need a filter for this view? If the answer is yes, do you know exactly which records you want the view to display? Do you believe that the filter will work correctly?   cid:129  Above all, make certain that you have a view diagram and View  Specifications sheet for each view. This documentation will be very useful when you finally implement the database in an RDBMS.  CASE STUDY   Your work on Mike’s database is finally nearing an end. You meet  with Mike and his staff to determine whether there is a need to estab- lish views for the database. The agenda you’ve set up for the meeting  involves the following steps.  1. Review the notes you’ve compiled during the design process.  2. Review each of the various samples you gathered during the  early stages of the design process.  3. Examine the subjects represented by the tables in the database.  4. Analyze the table relationships.  5. Review and study the business rules.  As the meeting progresses, you identify several views that you need  to define, including a PREFERRED CUSTOMERS view and a VEN- DOR PRODUCT COUNT view. The first view will provide the name and  phone number of each customer who has a “Preferred” status, and the  second view will provide information on the total number of different  products each vendor supplies.  You base the PREFERRED CUSTOMERS view on the  CUSTOMERS  table and use the CUSTOMERID, CUSTFIRST NAME, CUSTLAST NAME,   CUSTHOME PHONE, and STATUS fields for the view’s structure. Before    Determining and Defining Views   461  you construct the view, however, Mike asks if there’s any way to dis- play the first name and last names together. You respond that it can  be done, so you create a calculated field called CUSTOMER NAME that  concatenates both of the fields together; this field will now replace the  CUSTFIRST NAME and CUSTLAST NAME fields. Figure 12.17 shows the view  diagram for the PREFERRED CUSTOMERS view.  Customers  PK  Customer ID CustFirst Name CustLast Name CustStreet Address CustCity CustState CustZipcode CustPhone Number Status  Preferred Customers  Customer ID Customer Name CustHome Phone Status  Figure 12.17  View diagram for the PREFERRED CUSTOMERS view  After you create the view diagram, you make note of the expression  that you’ll use to filter the view’s data:  Status = “Preferred”  Then you complete a View Specifications sheet for the PREFERRED  CUSTOMERS view. Figure 12.18 shows the results of your work.   462  Chapter 12  Views  VIEW SPECIFICATIONS  General Information  Name: Description:  Preferred Customers This View provides the names and phone numbers of our Preferred customers.

You use the  VENDOR NAME field from the VENDORS table to display the names of  the vendors. Next, you create a calculated field called PRODUCT COUNT to  display the total number of products each vendor supplies. This is the  expression the field uses to calculate the total:  Count ProdName   Now you create a diagram for the view, as shown in Figure 12.19.

You then repeat this process for every view you’ve identified for Mike’s  database.   464  Chapter 12  Views  VIEW SPECIFICATIONS  General Information  Name: Description:  Vendor Product Count This view tells us how many products are supplied by each vendor.

Views are use- ful for several reasons—they provide a means for you to work with data  from multiple tables, they help enforce data integrity, and they help  keep data secure or confidential.  We then discussed the three types of views: data, aggregate, and val- idation. You learned that each type of view could be based on one or  more tables, other views, or a combination of both. Your RDBMS will  rebuild and repopulate a view every time you access it, using the most  current data from the view’s base tables. As you now know, there must  be relationships between tables in a multitable view  thus making the  view’s information valid and meaningful , and the characteristics of  those relationships are carried forth through the view. Additionally,  you can modify most views, and all the modifications you make to the  data are passed through the view to the base tables. You also learned  that validation views work in the same manner as validation tables  and that they have distinct advantages over validation tables. For  instance, validation views can incorporate data from multiple tables.  The chapter then continued with a discussion of determining and  defining views for the database. Here you learned several specific  points to keep in mind while you work with users and management to  identify the organization’s view requirements. Next, we discussed how  to define a view, and you learned how to create a view diagram to doc- ument the view. Now you know how to select fields from the base tables  and assign them to the view.  We then discussed how to use calculated fields in a view. You learned  that you could use them to help provide pertinent information and to  enhance how the view displays its data. You also learned that calcu- lated fields are especially crucial in aggregate views and that each    466  Chapter 12  Views  calculated field uses an expression to derive the value it displays. Next,  you learned how to apply a filter to a view so that it will retrieve and  display a specific set of records. The view will display a given record  only if it meets the criteria you’ve imposed against one or more fields in  the view. You frame each criterion as an expression and use it to test  the value of a particular field.  The chapter closed with a discussion of the View Specifications sheet.  Here you learned how to document the characteristics of the view,  such as its name and type. You also learned about the items that com- pose the View Specifications sheet and how you use them to record the  view’s characteristics.  Review Questions  1.

Case Study—Wrap-Up  Summary  You are now at the final stage of the database design process. You’ve  accomplished many things since you started the process. Thus far you  have   cid:129  Perceived the advantages of the relational database model and  how it compares to other database models   cid:129  Created a mission statement for a new database   cid:129  Defined mission objectives for the new database   cid:129  Performed a complete analysis of an old database   cid:129  Identified the organization’s information requirements   cid:129  Defined all the appropriate table structures   cid:129  Assigned a primary key to each table  469   470   Chapter 13  Reviewing Data Integrity   cid:129  Established field specifications for each field   cid:129  Established table relationships   cid:129  Defined and established business rules   cid:129  Defined all the appropriate views   cid:129  Established overall data integrity  For all intents and purposes, your new database is complete; neverthe- less, it would be to your advantage to perform one final review of the  overall data integrity of your database.  Why You Should Review Data Integrity  You’re probably wondering why you should review the database struc- ture one last time, given that you’ve paid attention to every detail and  have focused on data integrity throughout the entire design process.  The answer is simple: You want to make certain that the data integrity  you’ve been so careful to establish is absolutely as sound as possible.  As you well know, a crack in the integrity could result in inconsistent  data or inaccurate information. However improbable, it is possible that  you may have overlooked something. The peace of mind you gain from  knowing that you have a solidly designed database is well worth the  investment of your time and effort of this final review.  ❖ Note  Remember: Garbage in, garbage out!  Reviewing and Refining Data Integrity  Reviewing data integrity is a simple task if you take a modular  approach, that is, if you sequentially review each component of overall  data integrity: table-level, field-level, and relationship-level integrity    Reviewing and Refining Data Integrity   471  and business rules. You should encounter very few problems here if  you have carefully followed the design method presented in this book.  The following sections briefly outline the points you should keep in  mind as you conduct the review, and they contain references to earlier  chapters in case you encounter any problems.  Table-Level Integrity  In order to ensure that you’ve properly established table-level integrity,  review each table and make certain that the table conforms to all of  the following points.   cid:129  There are no duplicate fields in the table.   cid:129  There are no calculated fields in the table.   cid:129  There are no multivalued fields in the table.   cid:129  There are no multipart fields in the table.   cid:129  There are no duplicate records in the table.   cid:129  Every record in the table is identified by a primary key value.   cid:129  Each primary key conforms to the Elements of a Primary Key.  If you believe you have problems with any of these items, resolve them  using the techniques and concepts discussed in Chapter 6, “Analyzing  the Current Database,” Chapter 7, “Establishing Table Structures,” and  Chapter 8, “Keys.”  Field-Level Integrity  You can ensure that you’ve properly established field-level integrity  after you’ve done the following:   cid:129  Made sure each field conforms to the Elements of the Ideal Field   cid:129  And made certain you’ve defined a set of field specifications for  each field   472   Chapter 13  Reviewing Data Integrity  You can resolve field-level integrity problems with the techniques dis- cussed in Chapter 9, “Field Specifications.”  Relationship-Level Integrity  Examine each table relationship to ensure that you’ve properly estab- lished relationship-level integrity. You’ve achieved this level of integrity  when you’ve completed these tasks:   cid:129  Properly established the relationship   cid:129  Defined the appropriate deletion rules   cid:129  Correctly identified the type of participation for each table   cid:129  And established the proper degree of participation for each table  If you identify a problem with a relationship, use the techniques in  Chapter 10, “Table Relationships,” to resolve it.  Business Rules  You can ensure that your business rules are sound by making certain  these tasks are complete.   cid:129  You’re sure that each rule imposes a meaningful constraint.   cid:129  You’ve determined the proper category for the rule.   cid:129  You’ve properly defined and established each rule.   cid:129  You’ve modified the appropriate field specification elements or  table relationship characteristics.   cid:129  You’ve established the appropriate validation tables.   cid:129  You’ve completed a Business Rule Specifications sheet for each rule.  If you encounter problems with any of your business rules, refer to Chap- ter 11, “Business Rules,” for the techniques necessary to solve them.   Assembling the Database Documentation   473  Views  Although views are not directly connected to any component of data  integrity, you should nevertheless review all of your view structures. As  you examine each view, make certain you’ve addressed these items.   cid:129  Each view contains the base tables necessary to provide the  required information.   cid:129  You’ve assigned the appropriate fields to each view.   cid:129  Each calculated field provides pertinent information or enhances  the manner in which the view presents its data.   cid:129  Each filter returns the appropriate set of records.   cid:129  Each view has a view diagram.   cid:129  Each view diagram is accompanied by a View Specifications  sheet.  If you encounter problems with any view, resolve them by using the  techniques discussed in Chapter 12, “Views.”  Once you’ve completed this entire review, you can be confident that the  database structure is sound, the data within the database is consis- tent and valid, and the information you retrieve from the database will  be accurate.  Assembling the Database  Documentation  Throughout the database design process, you’ve generated a number of  lists, specification sheets, and diagrams used to record various aspects  of the database design. You should now assemble them into a central  repository, preferably in a set of binders or in an organized set of fold- ers and files on a computer. The design repository should consist of the  following sets of documents:   474   Chapter 13  Reviewing Data Integrity   cid:129  Final table list   cid:129  Field Specifications sheets   cid:129  Calculated field list   cid:129  Table structure diagrams   cid:129  Relationship diagrams   cid:129  Business Rule  Specifications sheets   cid:129  View diagrams   cid:129  And View Specifications sheets  Two additional sets of items you may consider keeping with this docu- mentation are the notes you compiled during the design process and  the samples you gathered during the analysis stage of the design pro- cess. You can keep each of these items in a separate appendix at the  end of the documentation.  All of these items constitute the complete set of documentation for the  logical design of the database. This documentation is vital for three  reasons.  1.  2.  It provides a complete record of the database structure. You can find every aspect of the logical structure of the database within the documentation. Additionally, you can answer almost any question concerning the database simply by referring to the documentation.  It provides a complete set of specifications and instructions on how the database should be created during the implementation process. This documentation is similar to an architect’s blue- prints: It indicates how the database is to be constructed. It also identifies the integrity that needs to be established for the database. Because the database design is not directed to a par- ticular RDBMS, the individuals implementing the database have   Done at Last!   475  full latitude concerning the manner in which they physically  implement the database.  3. Should it seem necessary to modify the database structure during  the implementation process, the design documentation can be used to determine the effects and consequences of any modifica- tions. Any modifications you make to the database structure should be the result of an informed decision. You can make cer- tain that a proposed modification will not have an adverse effect on the database structure by referencing the documentation first.  Done at Last!  Now that you’ve completed the integrity review and assembled all of the  documentation for the database, the logical database design process  is complete. You can rest assured that you have a properly designed  database and that its implementation will proceed smoothly. On to the  next client and the next database design!  CASE STUDY—WRAP-UP  This is your last meeting with Mike and his staff. Your objective is to  review his database and its integrity one final time. Although you’re  confident that you will not find any problems, you want to give the  database one final quality-control review.  During the meeting, you review each of the database structures to  ensure that they are in accordance with the various elements that  govern them. Then you review each component of overall data integrity  to make certain that you’ve properly established table-level, field-level,  and relationship-level integrity, as well as business rules. Finally, you  gather all of the documentation you’ve generated throughout the design    476   Chapter 13  Reviewing Data Integrity  process. After you’ve assembled all of the documentation into a set of  binders, you give the binders to Mike and declare that his database is  now complete. Mike expresses his thanks and gratitude for a job well  done and promises your check will be in the mail by the fifteenth of  the month. You express your thanks to Mike and his staff, say your  good-byes, and depart for new horizons. As you leave, Mike stares in  your direction; one final thought occurs to him:  “Now, if I could just get you to implement my database for me . . .”  Summary  The chapter opened with a list of your accomplishments since you  began the database design process. It then continued with a discus- sion of why you should review overall data integrity one final time.  This was followed by a brief discussion of the points to keep in mind  as you review each component of overall data integrity. We closed the  chapter by discussing the importance of the documentation you’ve  assembled during the entire design process.   Part III Other Database  Design Issues   This page intentionally left blank    14 Bad Design— What Not to Do  Mistakes are always initial. —CESARE PAVESE  Topics Covered in This Chapter  Flat-File Design  Spreadsheet Design  A Final Thought  Summary  Database Design Based on the Database Software  You may have wondered why this chapter appears at the end of the  book instead of at the beginning. The reason is simple: You can appre- ciate the dangers presented by a poorly designed database now that  you’ve learned how to design a database properly. Additionally, you will  be able to determine for yourself why a particular design is bad—you’ll  look at the design and be able to identify the problems with the struc- ture immediately. You also possess the knowledge required to identify  possible solutions to these problems.  In this chapter, you’ll see the three most common design approaches  that lead to poorly structured databases. The discussions are brief  because they are only meant to illustrate types of design you should  avoid. It should now be obvious that the way to resolve an improperly  designed database is to take it through the complete design process  you’ve just learned.  479   480   Chapter 14  Bad Design—What Not to Do   Flat-File Design  This type of design  sometimes known as the “throw-everything-in- to-one-big-table” design  has been in existence for many years and  is common in databases that have been designed for implementation  in nonrelational database management systems. A flat-file design is  fraught with problems, as you can see by examining the structure in  Figure 14.1.  Order Number  Customer Phone  Item 2 Extension  Customer Orders  Order Date  Ship Date  Order Amount  Sales Rep Name  Customer Number  Customer Name  Customer Address  Table Structures  Item 3  Quantity 3  Price 3  Item 1 Extension  Item 3 Extension  Item 1  Quantity 1  Price 1  Item 2  Quantity 2  Price 2  Figure 14.1.   An example of a flat-file structure  This diagram represents the structure of a single table.  Imagine how  other tables within the database are structured!  You can readily see  that this structure will inevitably cause problems with redundant data  and inconsistent data and that it suffers from a lack of data integrity.  As you’ve probably already noted, there are a few other problems with  this structure.   cid:129  Multipart fields: SALES REP NAME includes the sales rep’s first and last names, CUSTOMER NAME includes the customer’s first and last   Spreadsheet Design  481  names, and CUSTOMER ADDRESS includes the customer’s street  address, city, state, and zip code.   cid:129  Calculated fields: The ORDER AMOUNT field contains a value that is most likely manually calculated, especially if the customer is ordering more than three items. The ITEM  EXTENSION fields are also all likely to be manually calculated. The value for a given ITEM  EXTENSION field is the result of multiplying the value of a related QUANTITY  field by the value of a related PRICE  field.  For example: ITEM 3 EXTENSION = QUANTITY 3 ∴ PRICE 3    cid:129  Unnecessary duplicate fields: Each of the fields pertaining to a particular item is a duplicate. For example, the ITEM 1, ITEM 2, and ITEM 3 fields are unnecessary duplicate fields.   cid:129  No true primary key: There is no field or group of fields that can uniquely identify a single record in this table. The ORDER NUMBER field is not a primary key in this table; if a customer orders more than three items, you’ll have to enter another record into the table using the same order number.   cid:129  The table represents more than one subject. This table represents  three subjects: customers, orders, and items.  Depending on your point of view, it also represents sales reps.   Now that you know the elements of good database design, you’re sure  to avoid a design such as this.  Spreadsheet Design  A spreadsheet is certainly a good tool if you use it properly and for the  purpose for which it was designed. For example, it is quite suitable for  work that involves complex mathematical calculations and statistical  analysis. Contrary to popular myth, however, a spreadsheet does not  make a good relational database. If your organization has a need to  collect, store, maintain, and manipulate various types of data, then    482   Chapter 14  Bad Design—What Not to Do   A  B  C  Store 100    344-0029   Manager: Mike Hernandez  Asst.

An example of a typical spreadsheet “database”  use the proper tool for the job by designing and implementing a real  database. For example, consider the spreadsheet in Figure 14.2.  This spreadsheet is being used to keep track of store managers for a  small chain of retail stores. As you can see, this approach has prob- lems as well.   cid:129  Duplicate fields: Each field on this spreadsheet is a duplicate  field. If you take the fields at face value, there are basically three fields in each instance: STORE NUMBER, MANAGER NAME, and ASSIS- TANT MANAGER NAME.   cid:129  Multipart fields: Each field holds two values. The first field stores the store number and phone number, the second field stores the manager’s first and last names, and the third field stores the assistant manager’s first and last names.   cid:129  Multivalued fields: The ASSISTANT MANAGER field is a multivalued  field because there can be more than one assistant manager assigned to a particular store.   Spreadsheet Design  483   cid:129  Difficult to use: Data-oriented tasks that can be performed with ease in an RDBMS program are tedious and time-consuming to carry out in a spreadsheet. For example, it would take you some time to create a list containing only the name of each store man- ager and his or her phone number.  After seeing the problems associated with a simple spreadsheet “data- base” such as this one, you can imagine the types of problems you  would encounter with a more complex database. If you’re currently  using a spreadsheet as a database, you can improve the database’s  quality, speed, and versatility if you remove it from the spreadsheet,  take it through the entire database design process, and implement it in  a suitable RDBMS.  Dealing with the Spreadsheet View Mind-set  When you begin to work with a true database and RDBMS, you must  break away from a spreadsheet view mind-set. This means that you’ll  have to resign yourself to the fact that certain ways of viewing the  data are now unavailable—you can no longer use typical spreadsheet  layouts. For example, consider a typical spreadsheet report shown in  Figure 14.3.  You cannot produce a report with this type of layout using a database.  Whereas a spreadsheet stores the data exactly as you see it on the  report, a database would store it in four separate fields within a table.  Figure 14.4 shows an example of a database report you could generate  for the same data. The database presentation is not the same as the  spreadsheet presentation, but it is just as clear.  The point to remember is that you’ll have to adjust the manner in  which you think about working with the data in your database. In the  end, there are many more advantages to storing and using your data  in an actual database than trying to use a spreadsheet in a similar  manner. A database gives you much more control over data integrity    484   Chapter 14  Bad Design—What Not to Do   Branch Stores  Bellevue  Redmond  Seattle  Store 118 Manager: Katherine Ehrlich  Store 201 Manager: Kevin Swanson  Store 211 Manager: George Chavez  Store 27 Manager: Mark Rosales  Store 75 Manager: Chris Warren  Store 322 Manager: Steve Horst  Store 105 Manager: Caroline Cole  Store 187 Manager: Julia Black  Store 200 Manager: Alan Jacob  Figure 14.3.

It also provides an almost  unlimited number of ways to retrieve the data, enabling you to obtain  a wide variety of information.  Database Design Based on the Database  Software  An RDBMS does not provide a basis or procedure or even a reason for  designing a database in a particular fashion—it only provides the tools  that you need to implement a design. In contrast, a formal database  design method provides both the principles and rationale necessary to  define a database properly and effectively.  Many people unwittingly fall into the trap of designing a database  based solely on the RDBMS software they will use for its implemen- tation. In many cases, they do so because they are already somewhat  familiar and skilled with a particular RDBMS  or their company or  organization is already using a particular RDMBS. This is an unwise  approach that you should avoid  as much as possible  for several  reasons.   cid:129  You’re likely to make design decisions based on your perceptions of  what your RDBMS can or can’t do. For example, you may decide not to impose a degree of participation for a given relationship because you believe the RDBMS does not provide you with the means to do so.   cid:129  You’ll inadvertently let the RDBMS dictate the design of the data- base as opposed to driving the design strictly from the organiza- tion’s information requirements. This usually occurs when you discover that your RDBMS provides only limited support for certain aspects of the database, such as field specifications and relationship characteristics.   486   Chapter 14  Bad Design—What Not to Do    cid:129  Your design will be constrained by your knowledge of the RDBMS. For example, you may decide not to implement relationship char- acteristics simply because you don’t know how to do so.   cid:129  Your design will be constrained by how skilled you are with your  RDBMS. Your skill level affects how efficiently and effectively you can implement various aspects of the database, such as field specifications and business rules.   cid:129  Using this approach to design a database commonly results in  improper structural design, insufficient data integrity, and prob- lems with inconsistent data and inaccurate information. Defining a database within an RDBMS can be deceptively easy. You may create a database that works, but you’re very likely to have a poor design without knowing it.   cid:129  In the end, the RDBMS that you know and love so well may not be  suitable for your organization’s database requirements.  You should always design the logical structure of your database with- out regard to any RDBMS. By doing so, you’re more likely to design  a sound structure because you’ll be focused on the organization’s  information requirements. Once your design is complete, you can then  clearly determine how you should implement the database  single-user  application, client server, web-based, and so on  and which RDBMS  you should use to facilitate the implementation.  A Final Thought  Through years of teaching database design and instructing people  in how to use various RDBMS software programs, I’ve observed an  interesting phenomenon: People who are familiar with the fundamen- tal principles of proper database design have a better comprehension of  their RDBMS and the tools it provides than those who know little at all  about database design. I believe this is due to the fact that the people    Summary  487  who know database design are able to understand why the RDBMS  provides certain tools and how they can  and should  use them. For  this reason—as well as the many others presented in this book—it  is to your distinct advantage to learn and understand good database  design techniques. This book does not map the only road, but it is, I  believe, the straightest, surest, and most easily traveled.  Summary  This chapter contrasted relational database design with weaker, less  effective design formats. First, we looked at flat-file design. You learned  that there are numerous fatal problems with this approach and that it  should be completely avoided. We then examined spreadsheet design  and you saw how constrained this approach can be. The chapter  closed with a discussion of designing a database using RDBMS soft- ware. You learned that this type of design is perilously dependent on  your familiarity and skill level with the software. Unlike a good data- base design method, designing a database around an RDBMS does  not provide you with principles and a rationale for designing a proper  database structure. Superficially, in the short run, the software prod- uct looks as good—it just doesn’t work as well in the long run as the  design method discussed in this book.

Documenting Your Actions  Summary  I always advocate following proper database design techniques. As  you’ve already learned, there are numerous reasons for doing so. But  first and foremost, you should use a good design method to ensure the  integrity of the database. I cannot overstate how important this is. You  now know the consequences of improperly establishing data integrity,  so following the rules is of paramount importance.  When May You Bend or Break the  Rules?  There are only two specific circumstances under which it is at all per- missible to bend or break the rules of proper database design. Unless  either of these is an inescapable imperative, you should use proper  database design techniques when designing your database.  Designing an Analytical Database  As you learned in Chapter 1, “Relational Databases,” an analytical  database stores and tracks historical and time-dependent data. This   489   490   Chapter 15  Bending or Breaking the Rules  type of database often contains calculated fields within some of its  table structures. The expressions used in many of these fields are  meant to record the state of a particular set of data at a given moment  in time; other fields store the results of aggregate functions.  You may have already surmised from the description that this type of  database violates proper database design because its tables contain  calculated fields  refer to Chapter 7, “Establishing Table Structures” .  In this particular instance, the violation is acceptable because of the  manner in which the data in the database is being used. I recommend  that you properly design the database first and then break the rules  only after judicious consideration—you should make a deliberate deci- sion to break a rule and understand why doing so is necessary in the  specific instance.  ❖ Note  Designing an analytical database requires a radically different design methodology than the one you learned in this book. If you determine that your organization requires an ana- lytical database, I strongly recommend that you acquire a good book on the subject and learn how to design such a database properly.  Improving Processing Performance  This is still the most common reason that people feel compelled to  bend or break the rules. Whenever an RDBMS takes what seems to be  an inordinate amount of time to process multitable queries or complex  reports, many people believe that the solution to the problem is to alter  the underlying table structures. For example, they would have you  modify a table in such a way that it includes every field necessary for  the query or report. While this modification does indeed increase the  speed at which the RDBMS processes the query or report  particularly    When May You Bend or Break the Rules?   491  in older systems , it also introduces a number of new problems, such  as unnecessary duplicate fields and redundant data. This is clearly not  a desirable solution, because it violates proper database design.  Unfortunately, real life is not as ideal as we would like it to be, so you  will sometimes find that you must decide between improving process- ing performance and holding to proper design principles.  Is It Worth It?  When you take a moment to really think about this dilemma, you’ll  soon realize that the question really isn’t about performance; it’s about  data integrity. Anytime you break the rules for the sake of performance   or any other reason, for that matter , you are surely going to introduce  data-integrity problems. The question you must ask yourself, then, is  this: Is the perceived increase in processing performance worth the  price of reduced  and, therefore, weakened  data integrity? As you well  know, the consequences of making imprudent modifications to your  data structures will eventually spread, like ripples in a pond, through- out your database. Here are just a few of the problems you’ll encounter.   cid:129  Inconsistent data: This is a result of introducing unnecessary  duplicate fields into a table. It will be your responsibility  or that of your application program  to ensure that the data in these fields is synchronized; if you modify the value in a particular duplicate field, you’ll have to make certain that the same modifi- cation is made to the remaining duplicate fields.   cid:129  Redundant data: Redundant data is also a result of introducing unnecessary duplicate fields into a table. When you edit a par- ticular value in a field that contains redundant data, you must be sure to make the same modification for each instance of that value.   cid:129  Impaired data integrity: Bending or breaking the rules often vio-  lates one or more components of overall data integrity, such as   492   Chapter 15  Bending or Breaking the Rules  table-level integrity and relationship-level integrity. It will be your  responsibility  or that of your application program  to compensate  for the lack of integrity—in whatever way it manifests itself—as  best as you can.   cid:129  Inaccurate information: You cannot possibly expect the database  to provide accurate information if it has any of the aforemen- tioned problems.  Improving Performance by Other Means First  If you still think you want to pursue this course of action in order to  improve processing performance, do it only as a last resort. Before you  take these measures, however, try to improve performance by some  other means first. Consider these alternatives.   cid:129  Enhance or upgrade the computer hardware. Cost is not quite the issue it used to be, so this is still the easiest way to increase pro- cessing performance. Items such as a faster CPU, more memory, faster and more efficient disk drives, and a printer that better meets your printing requirements will all help to greatly decrea se the time it takes the RDBMS to process a complex query or report.   cid:129  Fine-tune the operating system software. Make certain that the  computer’s operating system is optimized for peak performance. This is especially important for networked computers and server hardware. You can greatly enhance general processing perfor- mance by working with the configuration options settings. The types of modifications you make to the operating system in gen- eral will depend on your operating system, so you’ll have to refer to your documentation to determine what types of modifications you can make.   cid:129  Review the database structure. Make absolutely certain that  the database is properly designed. It makes quite a difference. Poorly designed databases actually contribute to poor processing performance.   Documenting Your Actions   493   cid:129  Review the database’s implementation. Examine how the data-  base is currently implemented within the RDBMS. Make certain you’ve taken full advantage of the RDBMS’s capabilities and defined the database as efficiently and completely as possible.   cid:129  Review the application program used to work with the database.  Here’s another area you should examine very closely. Is the appli- cation program well written? Does it make the best use of the tools the RDBMS provides? Are the application’s components well defined? In some cases, a report may print more slowly because it is poorly designed—there may be more effective ways to design and generate the same report. Queries may run slowly because they are improperly defined. Make certain that each query is defined correctly and in the most efficient way possible.  If you believe you must depart from proper database design tech- niques, carefully examine your situation. As I mentioned earlier, it’s  acceptable to suspend the rules if you are designing an analytical  database. But I still strongly recommend that you design your data- base properly and thoroughly and relax the rules only for very specific  reasons.  Documenting Your Actions  If you’ve exhausted all other options and still come to the conclusion  that you need to bend or break the rules, then you must document each  rule you break and each action you take! It is important that you doc- ument your changes because doing so will compel you to think about  the consequences of what you are about to do and it provides a means  of recording the changes you make to the database structure. Should  you decide later that the modifications did not provide significant ben- efits, you can use the documentation as a guide to reverse the modifi- cations you initially made.   494   Chapter 15  Bending or Breaking the Rules  These are the items that you should record.   cid:129  The reason you’re breaking the rules: Increasing processing  performance and decreasing the time it takes to print complex reports are two of the most common reasons for breaking the rules. Whatever your reason, be sure to state it thoroughly and clearly.   cid:129  The design principle you’re violating: Recording how you’ve altered  the database design will give you the means to reverse these changes later should you determine that performance did not significantly improve. You might indicate that you’re altering the structure of a table, for example.   cid:129  The aspect of the database that you’re modifying: Indicate which  particular field, table, relationship, or view you are going to alter. Once again, this information will be valuable should you decide to reverse the modifications.   cid:129  The specific modifications you are making: Once you determine which item you need to modify, record the exact modifications you make to that item. For example, if you need to modify a rela- tionship, note the exact changes you make to its characteristics.   cid:129  The anticipated effects on the database and the application pro-  gram: Any modifications you make to the database are going to affect all accompanying end-user application programs. For example, altering the structure of a particular table can affect data integrity, view structures, data entry forms and reports built upon the table  either partially or totally , and programming code that refers to the table. You must be sure to list every effect.  Add this document to the documentation you compiled for the data- base. Even if you reverse the changes later, this record could prevent  you from yielding to a future impulse to attempt the same types of  changes.   Summary  495  Summary  The chapter opened by examining the two circumstances under which  you might feel compelled to depart from proper database design tech- niques. You learned that breaking the rules is acceptable if you are  designing an analytical database; otherwise, you should design the  database properly first and then make deliberate decisions to break or  bend specific rules. You then learned that the most common reason  for departing from proper design techniques is to improve processing  performance. Although this is not a satisfactory reason for breaking  the rules, there are times when circumstances dictate that you must  consider such changes.  We then continued with a discussion of the alternate measures you  can take to improve processing performance, such as enhancing or  upgrading the hardware and reviewing the implementation of the  database. You learned that you should do all you can to improve per- formance first and depart from proper design techniques only as a last  resort. The chapter then closed with a list of items you should record if  you need to break the rules.

I pointed  ahead—ahead of myself as well as you. —GEORGE BERNARD SHAW  I’ve always believed that you shouldn’t have to be a rocket scien- tist in order to design a database properly. It should be a relatively  straightforward task that can be performed by anyone possessing a  good amount of common sense. As long as you follow a good database  design method, you should be able to design a sound and reliable data- base structure.  You now possess the knowledge and skills necessary to design a rela- tional database. You know how to define the necessary structures,  establish table relationships, and implement various levels of data  integrity. If you encounter improperly or poorly designed structures,  you now know how to improve them.  Learning about database design is an ever-continuing process. You  can learn enough to design the types of databases you require, you  can turn it into a profession, or you can even make it a lifelong study.  Whatever your approach, you’ll encounter one inescapable fact: The  more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know it all. But don’t be  discouraged; this is true of any major subject you endeavor to learn,  such as music, art, philosophy—or rocket science!  I sincerely hope you’ve enjoyed reading this book as much as I’ve  enjoyed writing it. I know that most technical books of this nature can  be a little dry, so I tried to inject a little humor every now and then,   497   498  In Closing  particularly in the interview and meeting dialogues. Those of you  who thought the conversations were relatively realistic are quite per- ceptive—they were very loosely based on a number of interviews and  conversations I’ve had with my clients over the years.  As a parting piece of advice, let me leave you with two words: Always  learn. Never be afraid or intimidated or reluctant to learn something  new. Learning opens the door to fresh ideas, different concepts, and  new perceptions. It encourages participation and communication  between individuals and broadens everyone’s horizons.  Learning is a journey that begins with but one step. You’ve taken the  first step by reading this book. Now you will continue your journey by  learning about other facets of database management.

Interviews are important because they provide a valuable commu- nication link between you  the developer  and the people for whom you’re designing the database. They help ensure the success of your design efforts, and they provide critical information that can affect the design of the database structure.  2.

You use open-ended questions to focus on specific subjects and closed questions to focus on specific details of a certain subject.  8. The Subject-Identification Technique allows you to identify subjects  within a participant’s response to a given question.  9. You identify specific attributes for a particular subject by using  the Characteristic-Identification Technique.   10. False. You should interview users and management separately.   11. The three basic types of information requirements you must iden-  tify are current, additional, and future.   12. The Preliminary Field List represents the organization’s fundamen-  tal data requirements and constitutes the core set of fields that you must define in the database.   13. Each item on the Preliminary Field List should have a unique name  to ensure that the characteristic appears only once on the list.   14. A value list specifies the acceptable range of values for a particular  characteristic and often enforces a given business rule.   510   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions   15. A calculated field stores the result of a string concatenation or  mathematical expression as its value.

You use the Preliminary Field List to help you define tables for the database because the fields on the list may imply subjects that the database needs to track.  3. When an item on the list of subjects and a differently named item  on the Preliminary Table List both represent the same subject, you select the name that best represents the subject and use it as the sole identifier for that subject.  4. The Final Table List provides the name, type, and description of  each table in the database.  5. These are the guidelines for creating table names.  a. Create a unique, descriptive name that is meaningful to the  entire organization.  b. Create a name that accurately, clearly, and unambiguously  identifies the subject of the table.  c.  Use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the  subject of the table.  d. Do not use words that convey physical characteristics.  e. Do not use acronyms and abbreviations.  f. Do not use proper names or other words that will unduly  restrict the data that can be entered into the table.   Chapter 7  511  g. Do not use a name that implicitly or explicitly identifies more  than one subject.  h. Use the plural form of the name.  6. These are the guidelines for composing table descriptions.  a. Include a statement that accurately defines the table.  b. Include a statement that explains why this table is important  to the organization.  c. Compose a description that is clear and succinct.  d. Do not include implementation-specific information in your  table description, such as how or where the table is used.  e. Do not make the table description for one table dependent  upon the table description for another table.  f. Do not use examples in a table description.  7. You assign fields to a table on the Final Table List by determin-  ing which fields best represent characteristics of the table’s subject.  8. These are the guidelines for creating field names.  a.

Do not use names that implicitly or explicitly identify more  than one characteristic.  g. Use the singular form of the name.  9. Poorly designed fields can cause problems with duplicate data and  redundant data.   10. You can resolve field anomalies by ensuring that the field complies  with the Elements of the Ideal Field.   11. These are the Elements of the Ideal Field.  a. It represents a distinct characteristic of the subject of the  table.  b. It contains only a single value.  c. It cannot be deconstructed into smaller components.  d. It does not contain a calculated or concatenated value.  e. It is unique within the entire database structure.  f. It retains a majority of its characteristics when it appears in  more than one table.   12. Redundant data is acceptable when it is the result of resolving a  multivalued field or an unnecessary duplicate field.   13. In general terms, these are the three steps you follow to resolve a  multivalued field.  new table.  a. Remove the field from the table and use it as the basis for a  b.

A subset table is a table that represents a subordinate subject of a  data.  particular data table.  Chapter 8  1. Keys are important for the following reasons.  a. They ensure that each record in a table is properly identified.  b. They help establish and enforce various types of integrity.  c. They serve to establish table relationships.  2. The four main types of keys are candidate, primary, foreign,  and non.  3. The purpose of a candidate key is to uniquely identify a single  instance of the table’s subject.   514   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions  4. These are the Elements of a Candidate Key.  a. It cannot be a multipart field.  b. It must contain unique values.  c.  It cannot contain null values.  d. Its value is not optional in whole or in part.  e. It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define  f. Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record  uniqueness.  in the table.  g. Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field  within a given record.  h. Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases.  5. True. A candidate key can be composed of more than one field.  6. Yes, a table can have more than one candidate key.  7. A field you create for the sole purpose of serving as a candidate  key is known as an artificial candidate key. You create this type of key when there are no “naturally occurring” candidate keys in a table.  8. The primary key is the most important key you assign to a table.  9. The primary key is important for the following reasons.  a. A primary key field exclusively identifies the table throughout the database structure and helps establish relationships with other tables.  b. A primary key value uniquely identifies a given record within  a table and exclusively represents that record throughout the entire database. It also helps to guard against duplicate records.   Chapter 8  515   10. You establish a primary key by examining the table’s pool of avail-  able candidate keys and then selecting one as the primary key.   11. These are the Elements of a Primary Key.  a. It cannot be a multipart field.  b. It must contain unique values.  c.  It cannot contain null values.  d. Its value is not optional in whole or in part.  e. It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define  f. Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record  uniqueness.  in the table.  g. Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field  within a given record.  h. Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases.   12. Before you finalize your selection of a primary key, you must make  absolutely certain that it exclusively identifies the value of each field within a given record.   13. An alternate key is a candidate key that was not chosen to serve  as the primary key of the table.   14. By establishing table-level integrity, you ensure the following.  a. There are no duplicate records in a table.  b. The primary key exclusively identifies each record in a table.  c. Every primary key value is unique.  d. Primary key values are not null.   516   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions   15. You should review the initial table structures for the following  reasons:  database  a. To ensure that the appropriate subjects are represented in the  b. To make certain that the table names and table descriptions  are suitable and meaningful to everyone  c. To make certain that the field names are suitable and mean-  ingful to everyone  d. To verify that all the appropriate fields are assigned to each  table  Chapter 9  1. Field specifications are important for these reasons.  a. They help establish and enforce field-level integrity.  b. They help enhance overall data integrity.  c. They compel you to acquire a complete understanding of the  nature and purpose of the data in the database.  d. They constitute the “data dictionary” of the database.  2. Field-level integrity warrants the following.  a. The identity and purpose of a field is clear, and all of the  tables in which it appears are properly identified.  b. Field definitions are consistent throughout the database.  c. The values of a field are consistent and valid.  d. The types of modifications, comparisons, and operations that can be applied to the values in the field are clearly identified.   Chapter 9  517  3. The three categories of elements within a field specification are  general, physical, and logical.  4. The three types of specifications are Unique, Generic, and Replica.  5. Composing a proper field description is extremely beneficial  because it forces you  and everyone in the organization  to think carefully about the nature of the data that will be stored in the field.  6. The Data Type element indicates the nature of the data that the  field stores.  7. The Character Support element indicates the type of characters  that a user can enter into a given field value.  8. The Display Format element governs the appearance of a field’s  value when it is displayed on a screen or printed within a document.  9. The types of keys indicated on a field specification are non, pri-  mary, alternate, and foreign.   10. False. Null does not represent a blank—it represents a missing or  unknown value.  a field.   11. The Range of Values element specifies every possible valid value for   12. An Edit Rule designates at what point in time a user can enter a  value into a field and whether he can modify that value.   13. The Comparisons Allowed element indicates the types of compar- isons a user can apply to a given field value when he’s retrieving information from the field.   14. A value expression is some form of operation involving field values,  literal values, or a combination of both, and it returns a single value that you can then use for a comparison operation.   518   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions   15. You use a generic specification for a field that serves as a template  for other fields within the database.  Chapter 10  1. A relationship is important for the following reasons.  a. It establishes a connection between a pair of tables that are  logically related to each other.  b. It helps to refine table structures and minimize redundant  data further.  c. It is the mechanism that enables you to draw data from multi-  ple tables simultaneously.  2. The three types of relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and  many-to-many.  3. The many-to-many relationship will pose the most problems.  4. You could possibly encounter problems such as these with a many-  to-many relationship.  a. It will be tedious and somewhat difficult for you to retrieve  information from one of the tables.  b. One of the tables will contain a large amount of redundant  data.  c. Duplicate data will exist within both tables.  d. It will be difficult to insert, update, and delete data.  5. A self-referencing relationship is a relationship that exists between  the records within a given table.  6. You begin the process of identifying the relationships among the  tables in the database by creating a matrix of all the tables.   Chapter 10  519  7. The two types of questions you can ask to help you identify exist-  ing relationships are associative and contextual.  8. You use a 1:N shorthand symbol to designate a one-to-many rela-  tionship in the table matrix.  9. You determine what type of relationship officially exists between each pair of tables in the matrix using formulas that correspond to the three relationship-type definitions.   10. You establish a one-to-many relationship by taking a copy of the  primary key from the table on the “one” side of the relationship and incorporating it within the table structure on the “many” side, where it then becomes a foreign key.   11. True. Retrieving information from tables with a self-referencing  relationship can be tedious and somewhat difficult.   12. You establish a self-referencing many-to-many relationship as you  would a dual-table many-to-many relationship—with a linking table.   13. You refine the foreign keys in the database by ensuring that each  one complies with the Elements of a Foreign Key.   14. The two element categories you must modify for a foreign key’s  field specification are the General Elements and Logical Elements categories.   15. A deletion rule determines what your RDBMS should do when you  place a request to delete a given record in the parent table of the relationship.   16. The two types of participation you can designate for a table are  Mandatory and Optional.   17. The degree of participation indicates the minimum number of records that a given table must have associated with a single record in the related table and the maximum number of records   520   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions  that the table is allowed to have associated with a single record in  the related table.   18. A relationship attains relationship-level integrity after you’ve veri- fied that it is properly established and its characteristics are suit- ably set.  Chapter 11  1. A business rule is a statement that imposes some form of con-  straint on a specific aspect of the database, such as the elements within a field specification for a particular field or the characteris- tics of a given relationship.  2. The two major types of business rules are database oriented and  application oriented.  3. No. Application-oriented business rules impose constraints that you cannot establish within the logical design of the database.  4. The two categories of database-oriented business rules are field  specific and relationship specific.  5. A field-specific business rule is one that imposes constraints on the  elements of a field specification for a particular field.  6. The constraint the business rule imposes is tested when you  attempt to perform one of three actions: inserting a record into the table or an entry into a field, deleting a record from the table or a value within a field, or updating a field’s value.  7. You document a business rule by filling out a Business Rule Spec-  ifications sheet for the rule.  8. The Business Rule Specifications sheet provides these advantages.  a. It allows you to document every database-oriented business  rule.   Chapter 12  521  b. It allows you to document every application-oriented business  rule.  c. It provides a standard method for recording all business rules.  9. The Action Taken section of a Business Rule Specifications sheet is  the area where you indicate the modifications you’ve made to the elements of a field specification or to a relationship diagram.   10. A validation table  also known as a lookup table  stores data that  you specifically use to implement data integrity.   11. Validation tables usually  but not always  comprise two fields: The first acts as the primary key and is what you’ll use to help you enforce data integrity, and the second is simply a non-key field that stores a set of values required by some other field in the database.   12. You can use a validation table to enforce a constraint that a busi-  ness rule imposes on a given field’s range of values.   13. You should review each Business Rule Specifications sheet to  ensure that you’ve properly established the rule it records and that you’ve clearly marked all of the appropriate areas on the sheet.  Chapter 12  1. You can refer to a view as a virtual table because it draws data  from base tables rather than storing data on its own.  2. Views are valuable for the following reasons.  a. You can use them to work with data from multiple tables  simultaneously.  b. They reflect the most current information.  c. You can customize them to the specific needs of an individual  or group of individuals.   522   Appendix A  Answers to Review Questions  d. You can use them to help enforce data integrity.  e. You can use them for security or confidentiality purposes.  3. The types of views you can define as you design the logical struc-  ture of the database are data, aggregate, and validation views.  4. Each time you access a view your RDBMS will rebuild and repopu-  late it using the most current data from the view’s base tables.  5. Field specifications and business rules determine the types of  modifications you can make to a view’s data.  6. The only requirement you must fulfill in order to define a multi-  table data view is that the tables you use to create the view must bear a relationship to each other.  7. A data view does not contain its own primary key because it is  not a table; a true table stores data and requires a primary key to serve as a unique identifier for each of its records.  8. The purpose of an aggregate view is to display information pro-  duced by aggregating a particular set of data in a specific manner.  9. Sum, Average  arithmetic mean , Minimum, Maximum, and Count are the most common aggregate functions that you can apply to a set of data.   10. A grouping field is a data field within an aggregate view that  “groups” multiple instances of a given value into a single instance of the value.   11. False. You cannot modify the data in an aggregate view because it  is composed entirely of grouping fields and calculated fields.   12. The difference between a validation table and a validation view  lies in their construction—a validation table stores its own data, whereas a validation view draws data from its base tables.   Chapter 12  523   13. You would keep the following points in mind as you identify view  requirements.  a. Review your notes with the group.  b. Review the data entry, report, and presentation samples you  gathered during the early stages of the design process.  c. Examine the tables and the subjects they represent.  d. Analyze the table relationships.  e. Study the business rules.   14. You should use calculated fields when they will provide pertinent and meaningful information or when they will enhance the man- ner in which the view uses its data.   15. You define a view that displays only science-fiction books by apply-  ing a filter to the appropriate field within the view.   16. You must complete a View Specifications sheet for every view in the database because it is on this sheet that you will record the characteristics of the view.

Elements of a Candidate Key   cid:129  It cannot be a multipart field.   cid:129  It must contain unique values.   cid:129  It cannot contain null values.   cid:129  Its value cannot cause a breach of the organization’s security or   cid:129  Its value is not optional in whole or in part.   cid:129  It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define   cid:129  Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record in   cid:129  Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field within a  privacy rules.  uniqueness.  the table.  given record.   cid:129  Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases.  Elements of a Foreign Key   cid:129  It has the same name as the primary key from which it was  copied.   cid:129  It uses a replica of the field specifications for the primary key  from which it was copied.   cid:129  It draws its values from the primary key to which it refers.   Elements of the Ideal Field   545  Elements of a Primary Key   cid:129  It cannot be a multipart field.   cid:129  It must contain unique values.   cid:129  It cannot contain null values.   cid:129  Its value cannot cause a breach of the organization’s security or   cid:129  Its value is not optional in whole or in part.   cid:129  It comprises a minimum number of fields necessary to define   cid:129  Its values must uniquely and exclusively identify each record in   cid:129  Its value must exclusively identify the value of each field within a  privacy rules.  uniqueness.  the table.  given record.   cid:129  Its value can be modified only in rare or extreme cases.  Rules for Establishing a Primary Key   cid:129  Each table must have one—and only one—primary key.   cid:129  Each primary key within the database must be unique—no two  tables should have the same primary key unless one of them is a subset table.  Elements of the Ideal Field   cid:129  It represents a distinct characteristic of the subject of the table.   cid:129  It contains only a single value.   cid:129  It cannot be deconstructed into smaller components.   546   Appendix C  Design Guidelines   cid:129  It does not contain a calculated or concatenated value.   cid:129  It is unique within the entire database structure.   cid:129  It retains the majority of its characteristics when it appears in  more than one table.  Elements of the Ideal Table   cid:129  It represents a single subject, which can be an object or event.   cid:129  It has a primary key.   cid:129  It does not contain multipart or multivalued fields.   cid:129  It does not contain calculated fields.   cid:129  It does not contain unnecessary duplicate fields.   cid:129  It contains only an absolute minimum amount of redundant  data.  Field-Level Integrity  This type of integrity ensures the following.   cid:129  The identity and purpose of a field is clear, and all of the tables  in which it appears are properly identified.   cid:129  Field definitions are consistent throughout the database.   cid:129  The values of a field are consistent and valid.   cid:129  The types of modifications, comparisons, and operations that can be applied to the values in the field are clearly identified.   Guidelines for Composing a Table Description   547  Guidelines for Composing a Field  Description   cid:129  Use a statement that accurately identifies the field and clearly  states its purpose.   cid:129  Write a clear and succinct statement.   cid:129  Refrain from restating or rephrasing the field name.   cid:129  Avoid using technical jargon, acronyms, or abbreviations.   cid:129  Do not include implementation-specific information.   cid:129  Do not make this description dependent upon the description of  another field.   cid:129  Do not use examples.  Guidelines for Composing a Table  Description   cid:129  Include a statement that accurately defines the table.   cid:129  Include a statement that explains why this table is important to  the organization.   cid:129  Compose a description that is clear and succinct.   cid:129  Do not include implementation-specific information in your table  description, such as how or where the table is used.   cid:129  Do not make the table description for one table dependent upon  the table description for another table.   cid:129  Do not use examples in a table description.   548   Appendix C  Design Guidelines  Guidelines for Creating Field Names   cid:129  Create a unique, descriptive name that is meaningful to the  entire organization.   cid:129  Create a name that accurately, clearly, and unambiguously iden-  tifies the characteristic a field represents.   cid:129  Use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the  meaning of the characteristic the field represents.   cid:129  Do not use acronyms, and use abbreviations judiciously.   cid:129  Do not use words that could confuse the meaning of the field  name.   cid:129  Do not use names that implicitly or explicitly identify more than  one characteristic.   cid:129  Use the singular form of the name.  Guidelines for Creating Table Names   cid:129  Create a unique, descriptive name that is meaningful to the  entire organization.   cid:129  Create a name that accurately, clearly, and unambiguously iden-  tifies the subject of the table.   cid:129  Use the minimum number of words necessary to convey the sub-  ject of the table.   cid:129  Do not use words that convey physical characteristics.   cid:129  Do not use acronyms and abbreviations.   cid:129  Do not use proper names or other words that will unduly restrict  the data that can be entered into the table.   Identifying View Requirements   549   cid:129  Do not use a name that implicitly or explicitly identifies more  than one subject.   cid:129  Use the plural form of the name.  Identifying Relationships  Use this procedure to identify the official relationship between a pair of  tables within a table matrix.  1. Select a pair of tables and note the entry at the junction of the  first table and the second table.  2. Locate the second table on the same side of the matrix you’re  working on and note the entry and the junction between it and the first table on the opposite side of the matrix.  3. Apply the appropriate formula  shown below  to the two entries  and identify the official relationship between the tables.  1:1 + 1:1 = 1:1  1:N + 1:1 = 1:N  1:N + 1:N = M:N  4. Diagram the relationship in the appropriate manner.  5. Cross out both entries on the matrix.  Identifying View Requirements  Use this procedure to identify your organization’s view requirements.   cid:129  Review your notes with the group of user management  representatives.   cid:129  Review the data entry, report, and presentation samples you  gathered during the early stages of the design process.   550   Appendix C  Design Guidelines   cid:129  Examine the tables and the subjects they represent.   cid:129  Analyze the table relationships.   cid:129  Study the business rules.  Interview Guidelines Participant Guidelines   cid:129  Make the participants aware of your intentions.   cid:129  Let the participants know that you appreciate their taking part in the interview and that their responses to the interview ques- tions are valuable to the overall design project.   cid:129  Make sure everyone understands that you are the official arbitra-  tor if and when a dispute arises.  Interviewer Guidelines   cid:129  Conduct the interview in a well-lit room, separated from distract-  ing noise, with a large table and comfortable chairs.   cid:129  Set a limit of ten people or fewer for each interview.   cid:129  Conduct separate interviews for users and management.   cid:129  When you have to interview several groups of people, designate a  group leader for each group.   cid:129  Prepare your questions prior to the interview.   cid:129  If you’re not very good at taking notes, either assign that task  to a dependable transcriber for each interview or get the group’s permission to use a voice recorder or digital recording device to record the interview.   cid:129  Give everyone your equal and undivided attention.   Relationship-Level Integrity  551   cid:129  Keep the pace of the interview moving.   cid:129  Always maintain control of the interview.  Mission Statements  A well-written mission statement has the following attributes.   cid:129  It expresses its point succinctly and immediately.   cid:129  It avoids unnecessary statements or details and is well defined.   cid:129  It avoids phrases or sentences that explicitly describe specific  tasks.   cid:129  It makes sense to you  the database developer  and to those for  whom you are designing the database.  Mission Objectives  A well-written mission objective has the following attributes.   cid:129  It comprises a declarative sentence that clearly defines a general  task and is free from unnecessary details.   cid:129  It expresses itself in general terms that are succinct, to the point,  and unambiguous.  the database.   cid:129  It makes sense to you and to those for whom you are designing  Relationship-Level Integrity  This type of integrity ensures the following.   cid:129  The connection between the two tables  or key fields  in a rela-  tionship is sound.   552   Appendix C  Design Guidelines   cid:129  You can insert new records into each table in a meaningful  manner.  effects.   cid:129  You can delete an existing record without producing any adverse   cid:129  There is a meaningful limit to the number of records that can be  interrelated within the relationship.  Resolving a Multivalued Field  Use this generic procedure to resolve a multivalued field.  1. Remove the field from the table and use it as the basis for a new table. If necessary, rename the field in accordance with the field name guidelines that you learned earlier.  2. Take the primary key from the original table and incorporate it into the new table structure. This field will perform two specific functions in the new table: It will serve as part of the table’s composite primary key, and it will serve as a foreign key that helps to establish the relationship between the new table and the original table.  3. Assign an appropriate name, type, and description to the new  table and add it to the Final Table List.  Table-Level Integrity  This type of integrity ensures the following.   cid:129  There are no duplicate records in a table.   cid:129  The primary key exclusively identifies each record in a table.   cid:129  Every primary key value is unique.   cid:129  Primary key values are not null.

I emphasize the word ideas because five  people can look at the same design and come up with five distinct vari- ations based on their needs, backgrounds, and personal points of view.  Remember that there is no right or wrong way to design a given data- base, but you do have to ensure that the tables, fields, relationships,  and views all conform to the guidelines you’ve learned from this book.  I intentionally omitted all but the primary and foreign key fields from  each table because I did not want to greatly influence you in any way  as to how the tables should be populated. I also omitted a majority of  the relationship characteristics for the same reason.  Should you see a design that you might be able to use, run it through  the entire database design process and treat it like an existing data- base. At the end of the process, you should have a database that suits  your needs.  559   560   Appendix F  Sample Designs  Entertainment Agency Database  Customers  Customer ID  PK  Agents  Agent ID  PK  Engagements  Engagement ID Customer ID Agent ID Entertainer ID  PK FK FK FK  PK  Musical Preferences  Entertainers  Customer ID Style ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Entertainer ID  Musical Styles  Style ID  PK  Entertainer Styles  Customer ID Style ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Entertainer Members  Entertainer ID Member ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Members  Member ID  PK   Sample Designs  561  School Database  Faculty  Staff ID  PK  Faculty Classes  Classes  Class ID Staff ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Class ID Subject ID Classroom ID  Staff  Faculty Subjects  Classroomes  Staff ID  PK  Staff ID Subject ID  CPK FK CPK FK  ClassRoom ID Building Code  PK FK FK  PK FK  Faculty Categories  Staff ID Category ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Subjects  Subject ID Category ID  PK FK  Buildings  Building Code  PK  Categories  Category ID Department ID  PK FK  Departments  Department ID  PK  Students  Student ID  PK  Student Schedules  Class ID Student ID Class Status  CPK FK CPK FK FK  Student Class Status  Class Status  PK   562   Appendix F  Sample Designs  Sales Order Database  Orders  Order ID Customer ID Employee ID  PK FK FK  Order Details  Order ID Product Number  CPK FK CPK FK  Customers  Customer ID  PK  Employees  Employee ID  PK  Categories  Category ID  PK  Products  Product Number Category ID  PK FK  Product Vendors  Product Number Vendor ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Vendors  Vendor ID  PK   Sample Designs  563  Office Inventory Database  Software  Item ID  Office Furniture  Item ID  Office Equipment  Item ID  PK  PK  PK  Items  Item ID  PK  Container Items  Container ID Item ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Containers  Container ID Storage Location ID  PK FK  Storage Locations  Storage Location ID  PK   564   Appendix F  Sample Designs  Bowling League Database  Tournaments  Tournament ID  PK  Teams  Team ID  PK  Team Members  Team ID Bowler ID  CPK FK CPK FK  Bowlers  Bowler ID  PK  Matches  Match ID Tournament ID Odd-lane Team ID Even-lane Team ID  Matches  Match ID Game Number Winning Team ID  Bowler Scores  Match ID Game Number Bowler ID  PK FK FK FK  CPK CPK FK  CPK CPK CPK   Sample Designs  565  Car Rental Database  Employees  Employee ID  Supervisor ID  PK  FK  Customers  Customer ID  PK  Rentals  Rental ID Customer ID Employee ID Location ID License Number  PK FK FK FK FK  Vehicles  Locations  License Number  PK  Location ID  PK  Maintenance Workorders  Workorder Number License Number Maintenance Type ID  PK FK FK  Maintenance Types  Maintenance Type ID  PK   This page intentionally left blank    G On Normalization  I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you. —UNKNOWN  People often wonder why I didn’t cover Normalization in the previous  editions of this book, given that it has been part of traditional data- base design for such a long time. The fact is that it’s unnecessary for  me to discuss it for two reasons.  1. A thorough discussion that would do justice to the subject is beyond the scope of this work, especially given the nontradi- tional design methodology I present here and the “for mere mor- tals” nature of the approach to the material.  2. Normalization is actually incorporated into my design process  anyway.  I’ll explain how in a moment.   I still get questions about this issue and see comments about it on the  book’s Amazon.com page, so I decided to include a discussion on how  the traditional Normalization process is incorporated into my design  process. Those of you currently studying the traditional design and  Normalization process will most likely understand my design method- ology more clearly once you’ve read through this material.  567   568   Appendix G  On Normalization  Please Note . . .  There are a few points I want to make perfectly clear before you con- tinue reading.   cid:129  Please read “The Design Method Presented in This Book” and the  “Normalization” sections toward the end of Chapter 2, “Design Objec- tives,” before you read anything else in this appendix. These sections provide an overall explanation of why and how I came up with my design methodology. They will also provide you with the context you need for the points I discuss in the sections that follow.   cid:129  This is not a formal discussion or tutorial on the traditional Nor-  malization process. There are books I’ve recommended in Appen- dix H, “Recommended Reading,” that discuss this topic quite well and very thoroughly.   cid:129  I assume that you already understand the traditional Normal-  ization process and its associated concepts and terminology. Throughout the lifespan of this book, I’ve found that the only people who are typically interested in this discussion are either database application programmers, people who already know Normalization, or students who are studying Normalization. As such, I assume that you are in one or more of these groups if you are reading this appendix.   cid:129  There is no literal one-to-one mapping between the Normalization  process as a whole and my design methodology. Normalization is indeed integrated into my methodology, but not in any distinct sequential manner. Whereas Normalization is a specific step of the tradition logical design process, it is transparently integrated throughout the entire design process in my methodology. This will become clearer as you read through the material.   cid:129  My design methodology will yield fully normalized tables. This is true, however, only if you follow my methodology as faithfully as   A Brief Recap   569  you would the traditional methodology or any other methodol- ogy. Taking shortcuts or failing to follow parts of the process will  result in poor table structures and poor integrity. But this is also  true if you do the same in any other methodology, traditional or  otherwise.  Hopefully, you’ve just finished reading the two sections in  Chapter 2.  Now I’ll explain how I integrated Normalization into my design  methodology.  A Brief Recap  I’ll start with a short review on how I came up with my methodology,  which you learned when you read those two sections in Chapter 2.   Let’s begin, however, by reviewing the overall steps in the traditional  design method.   cid:129  Identify major entities.   cid:129  Identify relationship types.   cid:129  Determine Primary Keys.   cid:129  Determine Foreign Keys.   cid:129  Associate attributes with entity or relationship types.   cid:129  Determine attribute domains.   cid:129  Validate the model using Normalization.   cid:129  Define integrity constraints.  The two things that bothered me the most about this methodology  were the Normalization process  as a whole  and the seemingly endless  iterations it took to arrive at a proper design.    570   Appendix G  On Normalization  I already knew that the purpose of Normalization is to transform a set  of improperly or poorly designed tables into tables with sound struc- tures. I also understood the process: Take a given table and test it  against normal forms to determine whether it is properly designed. If it  isn’t designed properly, make the appropriate modifications, retest it,  and repeat the entire process until the table structure is sound.  Figure G.1 shows how I visualized the process at this point.  Non-Normalized Tables  Normalization  Process  Figure G.1  How I viewed the general Normalization process  Normalized Tables  There are a number of normal forms, and each one is used to test for  a particular set of problems or characteristics, such as modification  anomalies, functional dependencies, transitive dependencies, multival- ued dependencies, join dependencies, domains, and keys. The problem  with normal forms is that they can be quite confusing to anyone who  has not taken the time to study formal relational database theory.  At one point, I asked myself, “Why do we take the time to create the  database almost three-quarters of the way through, come to a screech- ing halt, and then determine whether we designed our structures cor- rectly?” I thought this was a ridiculous way to do things.   A Brief Recap   571  Wait a minute! Do we even have sound structures?  Keeping the purpose of Normalization in mind, I then posed the follow- ing questions.  1.  If we assume that a thoroughly normalized table is properly and efficiently designed, shouldn’t we be able to identify the specific characteristics of such a table and state these to be the attri- butes of an ideal table structure?  2. Couldn’t we then use that ideal table as a model for all tables we  create for the database throughout the design process?  The answer to both questions, of course, is yes, so I used this premise  as the basis for my “new” design methodology. I first compiled distinct  sets of guidelines for creating sound structures by identifying the final  characteristics of a well-defined database that successfully passed the  tests of each normal form. I then conducted a few tests, using the new  guidelines to create table structures for a new database and to correct  flaws in the table structures of an existing database. These tests went  very well, so I decided to apply this technique to the entire traditional  design methodology. I formulated guidelines to address other issues  associated with the traditional design method, such as domains,  subtypes, relationships, data integrity, and referential integrity. After    572   Appendix G  On Normalization  I completed the new guidelines, I performed more tests and found that  my methodology worked quite well.  My design methodology removes many aspects of the traditional design  methodology that new database developers find intimidating. For  example, Normalization, in the traditional sense, is now transparent  to the developer because it is incorporated  via the new guidelines   throughout the design process. The methodology is also clear and easy  to implement, which I believe is due to the fact that the guidelines are  in plain English, making them easy for most anyone to understand.  I believe that the process of designing a database is not and should  not be hard to understand. As long as the process is presented in  a straightforward manner and each concept or technique is clearly  explained, anyone should be able to design a database properly.  How Normalization Is Integrated into  My Design Methodology  As I mentioned earlier, there is no direct one-to-one mapping between  Normalization and my design methodology. Rather, various elements of  my methodology transparently work together to resolve the issues usu- ally addressed by the Normalization process. My approach additionally  and transparently addresses and resolves other traditional design  issues such as scalar values, determinates, functional dependencies,  domains, modification anomalies, referential integrity, cardinality, and  optionality.  Let’s first look at the fundamental issues each Normal Form addresses  before I show you how my system specifically deals with them  see  Table G.1 .  Keeping this in mind  along with the other issues I referenced earlier , I  originally strove to develop a design methodology that incorporated all     How Normalization Is Integrated into My Design Methodology   573  Table G.1   Fundamental Issues Addressed by Each Normal Form  First Normal Form  Second Normal Form  Third Normal Form  Deals with functional and multivalued  dependencies  Deals with functional dependencies, transi- tive dependencies, and calculated fields  Deals with functional dependencies and  modification anomalies  Fourth Normal Form  Deals with multivalued dependencies  Fifth Normal Form  Deals with join dependencies  Sixth Normal Form  Primarily used on spatial data  Boyce Codd Normal Form  Deals with determinates and candidate  keys  Domain Key Normal Form  Deals with domains and keys  this and addressed it in a more efficient and far less repetitive man- ner. I also wanted my methodology to be clear and easily understood  by anyone deciding to adopt it. That is why I specifically decided to  move away from the traditional jargon and mathematical approach and  instead use plain English to describe the processes I developed.  Table G.2 shows how various components of my design methodology  address traditional Normalization and design issues.  As I’ve said all along, my approach does indeed deal with all of the  issues you would typically address with the Normalization process,  and it will yield fully normalized tables. It will only do so, however, if  you follow my methodology as faithfully as you would the traditional  methodology or any other methodology. Keep in mind that you’re actu- ally dealing with all of these issues as you develop the database instead  of waiting to deal with them until you’re about two-thirds of the way  through the process in the traditional method. I’ve found this to be a  much better approach to design—there’s less repetitiveness and it cer- tainly takes less time overall to design the database.    574   Appendix G  On Normalization  Table G.2  How My Methodology Addresses Traditional Normalization and  Design Issues  Component of My Design  Methodology  Traditional Normalization or Design Issues  It Addresses  Business Rule Specifications  Logical domains, validation tables  Elements of a Candidate  Primary Key  Elements of a Foreign Key  Elements of the Ideal Field  Elements of the Ideal Table  Field-Level Integrity  Field Specifications  Functional dependencies, multivalued  dependencies, transitive dependencies,  determinates  Foreign keys, referential integrity, modifi- cation anomalies  Scalar values, multivalued and multipart  fields, calculated values  Functional dependencies, multivalued  dependencies, transitive dependencies,  join dependencies, duplicate fields, dupli- cate and redundant data, modification  anomalies, subtypes  Scalar values, physical domains, logical  domains, domain integrity  Scalar values, physical domains, logical  domains, domain integrity  Relationship Characteristics  Cardinality, optionality, deletion rules  Relationship-Level Integrity  Referential integrity, foreign keys  Resolving Multipart Fields  Scalar values, logical domains  Resolving Multivalued Fields  Scalar values, logical domains  Table-Level Integrity  Primary key integrity, duplicate records,  functional dependencies   Logical Design versus Physical Design and Implementation   575  Logical Design versus Physical Design  and Implementation  I’m occasionally asked why I didn’t include more discussion on SQL  and implementation issues such as indexing, partitioning, and distri- bution. The answer is quite simple: I’ve always believed that the logical  design process and the physical design and implementation processes  should be kept separate.   I still believe that many people unwittingly fall into the trap of design- ing a database based solely on the RDBMS software they will use  for its implementation. In many cases, they do so because they are  already somewhat familiar and ski lled with a particular RDBMS or  their company or organization is already using a particular RDBMS.  This is an unwise approach that you should avoid  as much as possi- ble  for several reasons.   cid:129  You’re likely to make design decisions based on your perceptions of  what your RDBMS can or can’t do. For example, you may decide not to impose a degree of participation for a given relationship because you believe the RDBMS does not provide you with the means to do so.   cid:129  You’ll inadvertently let the RDBMS dictate the design of the data- base as opposed to driving the design strictly from the organiza- tion’s information requirements. This usually occurs when you discover that your RDBMS provides only limited support for certain aspects of the database, such as field specifications and relationship characteristics.   cid:129  Your design will be constrained by your knowledge of the RDBMS. For example, you may decide not to implement relationship char- acteristics simply because you don’t know how to do so.   cid:129  Your design will be constrained by how skilled you are with your  RDBMS. Your skill level affects how efficiently and effectively you   576   Appendix G  On Normalization  can implement various aspects of the database, such as field  specifications and business rules.   cid:129  Using this approach to design a database commonly results in  improper structural design, insufficient data integrity, and prob- lems with inconsistent data and inaccurate information. Defining a database within an RDBMS can be deceptively easy. You may create a database that works, but you’re very likely to have a poor design without knowing it.   cid:129  In the end, the RDBMS that you know and love so well may not be  suitable for your organization’s database requirements.  I believe you should always design the logical structure of your data- base without regard to any RDBMS. By doing so, you’re more likely to  design a sound structure because you’ll be focused on the organiza- tion’s information requirements. Once your design is complete, you can  then clearly determine how you should implement the database  sin- gle-user application, client server, web-based, and so on  and which  RDBMS you should use to facilitate the implementation.   The preceding content is in the “Database Design Based on the Data- base Software” section in Chapter 14, “Bad Design—What Not to Do,”  but I thought it bore repeating here.   I hope this finally clears any confusion and answers any questions  you may have regarding my design methodology and Normalization.  I’ve certainly accomplished my goal if you now at least understand my  approach a little more clearly and see how it does address the same  issues as Normalization.    H Recommended Reading  Should you be interested in pursuing an in-depth study of database  technology, here are my recommendations for books on this subject.  I’ve chosen these particular books because they have stood the test  of time and have become “standard reading” within the database  industry and academic institutions.  I’m pleased to state that my book  has become part of this notable list.  Keep in mind that most of these  books are going to be challenging to read; the authors presume that  you have a fair amount of background in computers and programming  or are pursuing a degree in computer science.

It represents a charac- teristic of the subject of the table to which it belongs and is the only  structure that actually stores data within the database.  Field-Level Integrity This type of data integrity warrants the follow- ing: The identity and purpose of a field is clear and all of the tables in  which it appears are properly identified; field definitions are consistent  throughout the database; the values of a field are consistent and valid;  and the types of modifications, comparisons, and operations that can  be applied to the values in the field are clearly identified.   584  Glossary  Field Specification Represents all of the general, physical, and logical  elements of a field.  This is traditionally known as a domain.   Field-Specific Business Rule A rule that imposes constraints on the  elements of a field specification for a given field.
