known wiki in the world,  Wikipedia. It's success has led it to become the wiki engine of choice for web developers looking to create a large, collaborative community where anyone can create, edit, and  delete content.  While MediaWiki is meant to be a completely open platform where anyone can contribute,  thanks to a large developer community, extensions have been created to lock down a MediaWiki wiki to restrict what visitors can do. Other extensions and administrative tricks  you will learn will allow you to increase the functionality of MediaWiki in ways you never  thought possible.  What this book covers  Chapter 1, About MediaWiki, introduces you to a history of wikis and how wikis were developed to create collaborative communities.  Chapter 2, Installing MediaWiki, explains about the essential software required to install  and run MediaWiki. It teaches you how to bring the MediaWiki installation files to our  web server so we can install the software. It also teaches how to create a database that  MediaWiki will use to store configuration information about the wiki as well as the content  that drives visitors to the wiki.  Chapter 3, Getting to Know Your Wiki, teaches you about how MediaWiki organizes pages and gives you the first couple of steps in transforming MediaWiki into your wiki. It also  teaches you how a page differs from an article, to avoid confusion throughout the book.  Chapter 4, Creating Content, teaches you how to go about making our content more attractive to the reader through different formatting techniques.            Preface  Chapter 5, Advanced Formatting, teaches you about lists, tables, and other formatting  techniques that we can use to not only make our wiki look better, but also to better manage  it and display our content.  Chapter 6, Putting the Media in MediaWiki, teaches how we can use multimedia to enrich  our wiki's content.  Chapter 7, Organizing Your Wiki's Content, teaches how to organize our content by creating  namespaces that allow us to group pages with similar purposes together, and we learn how to use categories to group pages with similar content together. It also teaches you about redirecting, moving, and swapping pages around so that we can ensure when a visitor comes  to our site, they find the information they are looking for because the page titles will match  up with page's content.  Chapter 8, The MediaWiki Administrator, teaches you that through proper management of the user groups, we can take away privileges and provide users with extra privileges. It also teaches how we can control the type of files we allow our users to upload to our wiki if we  have enough trust in our user base.  Chapter 9, Multi-user Environment, teaches how to modify our profiles and change the  editing preferences. It also shows how the administrators, or sysops, can view a page's  history to view previous edits made to the page.  Chapter 10, Advanced Customization, teaches how to modify the look and functionality of our  wiki so that it not only has the appearance that we want, but also the functionality.  Chapter 11, Maintaining MediaWiki, teaches you how to back up our database using phpMyAdmin, and our filesystem by copying important files, so that in the event of a disaster  we could restore our wiki back to its functional state. We also learn how to restore our wiki  from these backups, most importantly, we see that we need to test our backups frequently by restoring them to see if everything is working.  Chapter 12, Integrating MediaWiki, teaches how MediaWiki can be integrated with some of the leading web applications to build powerful sites for your visitors. Specifically, we  saw how extensions allow us to display WordPress comments on a related wiki page and authenticate to our wiki with a Joomla! username.  What you need for this book  MediaWiki requires you to have access to a web server. Throughout the course of this book,  it is assumed that you will be using a hosting account through a web service provider. If you  are installing MediaWiki on a local server of your own, that is fine as well.  Additionally, you will need to have PHP version 5.0 or later and either MySQL 4.0 or later,  or PostgreSQL version 8.1 or later.  [ 2 ]               Who this book is for  If you are a Web Designer, IT Administrator or Executive, or a Programmer and wish to gain a  solid foundation in the MediaWiki software application, then this book is for you.  Preface  Conventions  In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.  To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:  Time for action – heading  1. Action 1  2. Action 2  3. Action 3  Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are  followed with:  What just happened? This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.  You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:  Pop quiz – heading These are short multiple choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.  Have a go hero – heading These set practical challenges and give you ideas for experimenting with what you  have learned.  You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of  information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "At the bottom of the page, type  {{templatename}} substituting your template for templatename."  [ 3 ]               Preface  A block of code is set as follows:  Add other file extensions to upload $wgFileExtensions = array ‘png','jpg','jpeg','ogg','doc','xls','ppt', 'mp3','pdf' ;  Ogg handler extension  require  "$IP extensions OggHandler OggHandler.php"  ;  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Click on Show preview to see your new template. If you are satisfied, click on Save page."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback  Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

Just a few years ago, websites were limited to static pages where information  was delivered at the hands of the site's webmaster. As technology progressed,  websites no longer relied on just a few pages of HTML to share information.  They grew into dynamic application platforms where content changed  instantaneously and groups of people around the world could collaborate to  build huge sites with tons of information for their visitors. Few technologies  embrace this type of collaboration and information sharing like wikis do.  In this chapter we shall:   Find out what a wiki actually is and how they came to be  Learn what we can use wikis for  See how wikis compare to other web technologies  Be introduced to MediaWiki and its features  See how MediaWiki compares to other wiki engines  So let's get on with it.               About MediaWiki  Before we get started                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [ 8 ]                                                                                                                                                         Chapter 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [ 9 ]               About MediaWiki  As word spread about the success of Cunningham's wiki, others quickly adopted this technology for their websites. Soon, clones of the original wiki engine were starting to  emerge in just about every programming language available.  Just about the time wikis were really starting to emerge as a viable tool, the Web 2.0 attitude  took over many of the design concepts for the web. Developers and designers started looking at technologies that could help promote interactivity and participation from their  visitors, not just the web masters. The freedom to collaborate and participate made wiki  engines a perfect fit for the Web 2.0 paradigm because of the following reasons:  A wiki is a piece of application that is used for collaborative participation  Users are the primary contributors to wikis  Users have the ability to edit existing content  Users do not have to register for the site before contributing; making the wiki a truly   open platform   User participation determines the site's success  While wikis remained popular within the programming and technical community, it wasn't until the introduction of one wiki in particular that the concept really took off with the  average user.  Introducing Wikipedia Since 1999, Jimmy Wales had been running a site called Nupedia as a free content encyclopedia with content written by experts. To make the content comparable to that found  in professional encyclopedias, everything submitted underwent an extensive peer review  process before it was published. In January 2001, Wales decided to create an encyclopedia with far less restrictions than his current Nupedia project. This encyclopedia would take on  the slogan of the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. To allow contributions and edits  from the public, Wales and Nupedia editor Larry Sanger turned to a technology that the programming community had been using for years, the wiki.  While Nupedia ceased operations in 2003, its counterpart, Wikipedia, has grown into the  largest wiki in the world with over 6 million articles written in 140 different languages!  Wikipedia is what introduced much of the world to the wiki. Not only is it the world's largest wiki, but it runs on the MediaWiki engine that we are going to install and configure over the  course of this book.  [ 10 ]               Chapter 1  What can you do with a wiki?  We have seen how wikis have been used by programmers and how a wiki engine was used to create the Wikipedia, but you may be asking, "How can I put a wiki to use?" You may even have a few ideas of what you would like to do with a wiki but are a bit unsure if it will work. The good news is, we will cover many different uses for wikis throughout this book with  real examples of how they are put to use. The bad news is, a wiki is not a solution for   all situations, but we will cover that as well.  When wikis are not the best choice Let's go ahead and get this part out of the way so we can focus on building a wiki with MediaWiki. While wikis can do great many things, they were not developed to be the sole means of providing content to the World Wide Web. The key to a successful wiki is making  sure that the community of users is willing, and able, to create and edit content for the wiki. Even with willing participants, there are many cases in which a wiki may not be the  technology of choice.  [ 11 ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      About MediaWiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [ 12 ]               Chapter 1  What are wikis good for? Okay, so we have covered when you would not use a wiki. Now, let's tackle the more relevant question, when is wiki a good solution? After all, you bought this book because you want, or  need, to implement a wiki.  Wikis can be used for a great many things. A wiki can be used for brainstorming  ideas, developing frequently asked questions  FAQs , knowledge management, course  management, collaborating on projects, a knowledge base, or providing reference material.  Of course, the previous list is not complete by far. Creative individuals have thought of many  different ways to implement a wiki.  While it is easy to say that a wiki has many different uses, it is better to show how they are  used. The following examples show how different organizations and companies use wikis to  share information. Each example not only uses a wiki, but they have chosen MediaWiki as  their wiki engine. As this book is about MediaWiki, we will be highlighting how MediaWiki is  a solution in each instance.  Community information sharing The best example of how a wiki can share information with a large community is  Wikipedia. With over 6 million articles, imagine how long it would take for a webmaster,   or even a team of webmasters, to post each piece of content. As the wiki software allows  users to post their own articles, a large amount of content can be shared almost immediately  after it was created.  The ability to edit and delete articles also makes Wikipedia so successful. One of the  problems that Nupedia faced was not only having content written for the site, but having  it edited and verified for accuracy. Using a wiki, Wikipedia can rely on the experts in the  community to enforce accuracy over the site's content.  Project collaboration Think about how easy work would be if you had the ability to view a document's edit history  with a simple click or being able to make sure you are not the only one in the office referring  to version 2 of a document while the rest of the team is working from version 4. While a word processor has tools to minimize this, not everyone has the same software at home that  they do at work. Again, a wiki engine like MediaWiki makes this all possible. Co-workers can share and collaborate without having to e-mail documents back and forth, and you don't have to worry about lost or forgotten USB drives because with a wiki, all content is hosted  and can be accessed from your web browser. Even if you use Firefox at work, and Safari at home, you will be able to work on documents without having to convert the files.  [ 13 ]                                  About MediaWiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [ 14 ]               Chapter 1  Building an entire website Now, we are not talking about hosting a standalone wiki such as Wikipedia, and we are not  talking about certain parts of a website like the user manual. There are organizations that  have built their entire website, from the home page to the download page, entirely   with MediaWiki.  [ 15 ]               About MediaWiki  If you have visited the MediaWiki home page then you have already seen a perfect example of this. If that example is much too obvious, then let's take a look at the site for the enterprise-grade network management software, openNMS  www.opennms.org . As the openNMS group spans the globe, it makes perfect sense to create a site that anyone, anywhere can contribute to, making it a true community and a true free open source  project. The following screenshot shows the openNMS home page created with MediaWiki:  Company policies and documents For many companies, creating an employee manual can be a nightmare. As laws and  regulations change, so do human resource policies, IT policies, and just about every other  governance that pertains to employees. Printing these manuals can be costly to begin with,  and making sure that each employee has the updated version takes quite a bit of effort and  manpower for a large organization.  [ 16 ]               Chapter 1  So what would allow a large group to create and maintain a site filled with content? A wiki  of course. With a solution like MediaWiki installed on an company's intranet, the human  resources department can host the employee manual and all of the forms that they require workers to fill out, information technology departments can post software installation  procedures and acceptable usage policies, and the finance department can provide  employees with updated information on direct deposit. The possibilities are as wide open  as the number of companies who use MediaWiki for this very reason. Big organizations  like Intel, Gyanasoft, and Aperture Technologies are some of the best examples of how big  organizations use MediaWiki for this exact purpose. Even smaller companies like Pepper Computer, Inc. make use of MediaWiki for employee documents.  Learning management With such a focus on collaboration and discussion, wikis are a great platform for learning  management. While it lacks the grading and testing features that a large scale learning  management system LMS  like Moodle has, MediaWiki can help someone put together  an extremely informative course. While companies may elect to use MediaWiki as a free  training resource for their products, one site that really shows off the power of MediaWiki  as a learning management tool is ECGpedia.  ECGpedia is an online course for nurses and doctors about electrocardiographs. The site   www.ecgpedia.org  provides students with the full course, reference materials, the textbook, and a large library of case studies. To better help students understand such a  complex subject, ECGpedia makes use of MediaWiki's ability to let users post multimedia  files using one of the many extensions available. If you visit the site, you can see a flash  movie of a beating heart that coincides with a normal rhythm.  [ 17 ]               About MediaWiki Comparing wikis to content management systems, blogs, and forums If you have been working with web technologies for a while, you may be asking if someone couldn't just use some other form of community software like a Content Management  System  CMS , forum, or blog for any one of these examples. The short answer is yes. These  technologies could be substituted for a wiki in many of the examples mentioned above.  However, if you think that a CMS, forum, or blog is an easier or more robust solution, take  the time to compare them against a wiki to see how easy and powerful a wiki can really be.  Let's look at a few differences:  CMS  Only those with certain accounts, such as administrators or editors, can post content. Visitors can only view content.  Wiki Anyone  can add or edit content without the need for an administrators approval. Even unregistered members  can be given permission to add and edit.  Only privileged members can contribute and or edit.  Everyone has the ability to contribute  by creating new articles, editing inaccurate content,  or adding  to existing content.  Feature  Posting or editing content  Method of contribution  Blog  Blogs usually only allow the blog owner to post content. Visitors  are usually restricted  to only commenting  on posts from the blog owner. Often many times these comments need to be approved before they appear on   the site. As the blog owner is the author of the content, he or she is the main contributor. Permissions can be given to certain authors as well. Most contributions are limited to commenting on other people's posts.   Forum  Registered members can post content, however posting may require approval first.  If a posting is closed, further comments are not allowed. Original posts cannot be changed by anyone other than the author.  Anyone participating is a contributor, however replies must focus on the original posting. Topics are generally moderated.   [ 18 ]               Wikis by nature are simple to use and simple to manage. There is no need for an  administrator to create user accounts and grant permissions since users can create their  own account. Once we get into writing and editing articles, you will see how easy it is for  your users to start using wikitext as well.  Chapter 1  MediaWiki  Now that we know the history of the wiki, and understand how wikis can serve many purposes, let's take a look at the most powerful wiki engine available—MediaWiki.  MediaWiki came to life to solve issues that Wikipedia was having with its wiki engine, UseModWiki. As Wikipedia grew and its content and traffic increased, it began to  outgrow the Perl-based UseModWiki. To address page load problems and provide greater  functionality, Lee Daniel Crocker went to work on a PHP-based application that utilized a  MySQL database for the backend while Magnus Manske went to work on the user interface.  In June 2003, Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, announced the creation of the  Wikimedia Foundation to manage all projects related to Wikipedia. In August of the same  year, MediaWiki was introduced and is now the wiki engine that runs all of the projects under the Wikimedia Foundation, including the flagship Wikipedia.  MediaWiki's features One of the reasons that MediaWiki is the wiki engine of choice for many organizations is that  it has so many features available for both users and administrators. Let's take a look at a few:  Easy navigation system: MediaWiki provides an easy navigation system with options   such as a search feature, a Go button that takes you directly to a page you have  searched for, Random page, Special pages, and a Printable version for articles.  Editing, formatting, and referencing: MediaWiki provides an easy way to edit,   format, and reference pages with other pages. It also gives us the option to track  changes. As wikis are deployed in multi-user environments, the ability to see who  created or edited a piece of content is a key feature to manage the content properly.   Look and feel change: Users can change the look and feel of a wiki site using  MediaWiki. They can use a variety of skins and make style changes for their  individual pages.   File uploading: MediaWiki gives you an option to add file upload capabilities to your   pages as we saw with ECGpedia. It also gives you flexibility to decide the allowable  file extensions that can be uploaded by users and also a list of file extensions to   be blocked.  [ 19 ]               About MediaWiki   Multilanguage support: MediaWiki supports many languages and UTF-8. So you can  implement MediaWiki in different languages. Many sites such as Wikipedia use the  multilingual feature, which allows you to read and write different languages using  the same piece of software.   User management: MediaWiki has a built-in user management system where you   can create new logins and assign user privileges if you require greater access control. You can also customize privileges for user types in order to fit your security needs.   Syndication: MediaWiki supports web syndication by providing RSS syndication   for many special pages such as Special pages  Newpages and Special pages  Recentchanges. Syndication helps you to grow your site rapidly in the web world.  MediaWiki and other wiki engines Of course, MediaWiki is not the only wiki engine to choose from. If you visit a site called Wikimatrix  www.wikimatrix.org  you will see a long list of wiki engines that are available to you. Now, MediaWiki was created specifically to run the largest wiki in existence. It is the  choice of large corporations such as Intel and Novell and small to medium-sized businesses  such as Moby Games. Many free open source projects rely on MediaWiki as an integral part of  their online presence. However, if you still don't know if MediaWiki is the right choice for you,  let's look at how it stacks up against some of the other wiki engines. The list below introduces  us to some of the other popular wiki engines:   DokuWiki: DokuWiki is a simple wiki engine written in PHP and can be used to create any  type of document. It is simple and standards compliant. It is suitable for small companies, development teams, and user groups. Instead of using a database, DokuWiki's data is saved in a plain text file or a flat file. The syntax is very simple yet powerful enough to  create any type of content. Key features includes simplified editing, linking, support for  image and other files, and plugins support to extend wiki functionality.  [ 20 ]               Chapter 1   PhpWiki: PhpWiki is a clone of original WikiWikiWeb. It was the first wiki software   written in PHP and was released in 1999. It supports a majority of the databases. The  installation process is very simple and gives you what you look for in an out of the  box solution. It supports plugins in order to increase functionality. It is suitable for  free-form discussion-based site creation and also for collaborative development sites.  PmWiki: PmWiki is a PHP-based wiki that does not require any database and uses   flat files like DokuWiki. It is very easy to install it and extend its functionality. It  supports a template system in order to change the look and feel of the website as well as the functionality to a great extent. It also provides an access control system  in order to protect site pages or groups of pages by enabling a password-protected mechanism. It also gives ample opportunity to customize the site as well as extend its functionality using plugins.   QwikiWiki: QwikiWiki is another wiki system written in PHP and does not require   any SQL database in order to operate. It uses cookies and its own filesystem in order  to process and manage files. It has some key features such as file uploading,   a template system, and an access control system.   Wikipage: It is small, but a wiki standard, easy-to-use system. Wikipage is more  secure than TipWiki. It has password-protection support for access control,  multilanguage, and multisite support. Other common features include file  uploading, table support, and so on.   TWiki: TWiki is a flexible, powerful, and easy-to-use enterprise collaboration pla-  tform and knowledge management system. It is a structured wiki written in Perl. It  is typically used to run a project development space, a document management system, a knowledge base, or any other groupware tool, on an intranet or on the Internet. It does not require any database since the data is stored in filesystem.  It has a large plugin system with more than 200 plugins available to use such as spreadsheet, image gallery, slide shows, drawings, charts, graphs, and so on.   Kwiki: Kwiki is perhaps the simplest to install, most modular, and easiest to extend.  It is written in Perl and also available in CPAN. Other than providing basic wiki  features, Kwiki by default offers slide shows, page backups, privacy options, and  blog capabilities that are not found in any other wiki. It supports a plugins system  in order to extend functionality.  [ 21 ]               About MediaWiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [ 22 ]               Chapter 1   Simplifying creating new pages: MediaWiki links you to pages that don't yet exist.   Click on a link that points to a nonexistent page, and the wiki will ask you for the initial content to be placed in the page. If you write this content, then the wiki will  create the page right then and there. All links to that page  not just the one you  clicked  will now point to the newly-created page. This is the simplest way of  creating a new page in MediaWiki. You don't even have to bother to create the  page, save it, and then link it from another page.   Simplifying site organization: MediaWiki uses a database in order to manage the   hypertext of the site. As a result you can organize your page however you want. Many CMS require you to plan classifications for your content before you actually  create it. This can be helpful if you are looking for a rigid structure. With MediaWiki  you can organize your page into categories and namespaces if you want. Instead  of designing the site structure, many wiki sites just let the structure grow with the content and the links inside their content.   Tracking all your stuff: As MediaWiki stores everything in a database that knows about all your links and all your pages it is easy for MediaWiki to show backlinks, a list of all the pages that link to the current page. It also stores your document history so that it can list recent changes to the document and even a list of recent changes to pages that link to the current page.   Encouraging discussions: Using the discussion page feature, users can communicate  and collaborate on an individual page's content and or edits. The discussion  page, or talk page as it is commonly called, is also editable by users to facilitate communication among the community.  Summary  In this chapter, we were introduced to a history of wikis and how wikis were developed to create collaborative communities. As we investigated how wikis are used, we saw examples  of how different companies and organizations use wikis in different situations, and each  of these examples highlighted the MediaWiki engine. To show how MediaWiki is a viable  solution for any wiki needs, MediaWiki's features were explained and it was compared to  some of the other popular wiki engines. In the next chapter, we will learn how to install MediaWiki on our server through FTP, cPanel, and through a proprietary application installer.  [ 23 ]                            2  Installing MediaWiki  Now that we have a pretty good idea of how we can put MediaWiki to use, we  have to get ready for the next step. As MediaWiki is a software package, we will  learn how to install it. Not only are we going to cover how to install MediaWiki  on your web server, but we are going to make sure that your web server has the  required hardware and dependencies installed as well.  As this is a beginners' guide, we are going to assume that most of you are installing MediaWiki on a server provided by a web hosting company. As you may well know, different  web hosting companies use different configurations for their servers. In this chapter, we will  cover some of the most commonly used methods for getting MediaWiki onto the server such  as through the use of a script library called Fantastico, cPanel, and an FTP client.  Once we have uploaded MediaWiki to the server, and are ready to install, we will cover all of the steps that need to be taken prior to installing the MediaWiki software. By the end of this  chapter you will have a working installation of MediaWiki that we will reference throughout  the rest of this book.  For demonstration purposes, I will be creating a new wiki alongside you that is dedicated to  free libre open source software at http:  www.flosspropopulo.com.               Installing MediaWiki  In this chapter, we shall:   Cover all of the software requirements for a MediaWiki installation  Learn what is the minimum hardware that is required to run MediaWiki  Prepare to install the software using a script library  Download a copy of MediaWiki for installation  Upload the MediaWiki files through cPanel and FTP  Prepare necessary directories on the server  Create the database for the MediaWiki installation  Run the installation script  If you are ready, let's get to it.  MediaWiki requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [ 26 ]               Chapter 2  PHP PHP is a recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting  language that helps people create dynamic web pages. Server side means that all of  the processing and compiling of the code happens on the server itself, not on the client requesting the web page. As it is server side, the web server needs to have the PHP engine  installed so that the server can handle these requests and deliver web pages that utilize PHP.  Remember that PHP itself is a programming language. In fact, it is the language that MediaWiki is written in! When you are researching web hosts, you need to make sure that  the PHP engine is installed on the server so it has the ability to serve MediaWiki pages to your visitors.  There are other server-side scripting languages that are similar to PHP in what they do.  Microsoft's Active Server Pages, or ASP.NET, and Sun Microsystems' Java Server Pages are languages that deliver dynamic web pages like PHP, however, they are not a substitute  for PHP as they will not compile code written in this language. Only the PHP compiler can  translate code written in the PHP language into code that your computer can read.  Likewise, other compilers for other computer languages only translate their language  into computer readable code.  Software version In order to run MediaWiki, any old version of PHP just won't do. At a minimum, you need to make sure your server is running PHP version 5.0. While this is the minimum, it is recommended that the server runs PHP version 5.1.x or later, for optimal performance.  Extensions In order for MediaWiki to work properly, certain PHP extensions must be installed as well. The Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, Session, and Standard PHP Library are the only  extensions required by MediaWiki and all three are enabled by default in PHP. You can  check with your hosting provider to make sure that they are using a default installation  of PHP, just to be sure.  Database We have seen in Chapter 1 that one of the advantages that MediaWiki has over some of the other wiki engines is that it stores articles, user information, and other data in a database.  Reliance on a database means that you have to make sure that your web server has a database installed on it as well.  [ 27 ]               Installing MediaWiki  MediaWiki supports four databases: MySQL 4.0 or later, PostgreSQL 8.1 or later, Ingres  2006 or later, and SQLite. While any one of these databases will work with MediaWiki, it is  recommended that you use MySQL. This database is commonly installed on web servers and  is the one we will be using.  Database management Databases can be tricky to use and require knowledge of a special language, Structured  Query Language  SQL . In order to work with SQL, many users choose to install database  management software on their server as well. One of the most popular packages for MySQL  is phpMyAdmin which can be downloaded from http:  www.phpmyadmin.net. If your hosting provider does not have a database management tool already installed for you,  ask them about having something like this installed. It is such a powerful tool that even advanced database administrators rely on it.  Web server This is kind of redundant. After all, we would hope that if we are paying for a web server,  it would have server software installed on it. Instead of worrying about whether or not your  host is going to have web server software installed, let's instead look at the choices.  MediaWiki has been tested, and runs using IIS 6.0, Cherokee, and lighttpd. While it runs in  these environments, you should choose Apache as the web server software to run your wiki  on. Apache is the preferred web server of most developers, so there is much more support out there for installations on an Apache web server.  If your hosting provider allows you to choose Microsoft hosting or Linux hosting, opt for the  Linux hosting. More often than not, Microsoft hosting packages have IIS installed as their  web server software while the Linux packages generally use Apache.  Hardware requirements In this book, we will cover how to install MediaWiki on a server through a hosting provider.  Any hosting service worth anything will provide you with hardware that exceeds the  minimum requirements for MediaWiki, so that shouldn't be a concern, right? Let's hope  not, but there are some issues that needs to be addressed when it comes to hardware,   so it is important that we cover this here.  The bare minimum MediaWiki requires you to have at a minimum, 258MB of RAM and 40MB of available storage space on your hard drive. However, this will not hold up if the website has a large volume of traffic and you certainly cannot allow any files, not even pictures, to be uploaded  if operating with the bare minimum.  [ 28 ]               Chapter 2  One final decision Before you install MediaWiki, you have one more decision to make, where you are going to install the software. Before anyone answers "On our web server of course!", let me explain.  When installing any software that you will use on your web server, you have the option of  installing it in the root folder, in a subdomain, or in a subdirectory.  The root folder is the foundation of your website; it is the folder that your domain name  and IP address will point to. If you install MediaWiki here, whenever someone enters your domain name, MediaWiki is what they will see. This may sound perfect if you are creating  a site that is a dedicated wiki, like Wikipedia. After all, your visitors will only have to type in  your URL and voila, they will arrive directly at your wiki. Some hosting providers do not allow  you to install certain software packages directly to the root folder. If you have trouble with  this, you have two options—ask your hosting provider to install MediaWiki for you, or install  to a subdomain or subdirectory. It is a good idea to check with your hosting provider about  your MediaWiki installation before you pay them any money. Some will go out of their way  to help you while others may not provide much assistance at all.  Subdomains A subdomain is part of the larger domain. If you registered mywebsite.com, it would be your domain. Subdomains are one level lower on the hierarchy. If you were going to install MediaWiki on a subdomain, you may create one called wiki. The files would then be  installed at wiki.mywebsite.com. Any links to your wiki would also use this address.  Sites use subdomains for a variety of reasons, the most common being organization. If a  website has multiple installations, for instance, they may have wiki.mywebsite.com, blog.mywebsite.com, and store.mywebsite.com. Now, the owner of that site can install the necessary software in each location. If you wish to install MediaWiki into a  subdomain on your site, check first with your hosting provider for instructions on   how to set one up.  Subdirectories Subdirectories are simply folders created in the root folder of your domain. Unlike the subdomain, a subdirectory is listed after the domain name: mywebsite.com wiki. This  is the most common way to organize a site because it is the most convenient. Unless you are an experienced webmaster, this is the route you should take if you are not installing MediaWiki into the root folder.  [ 29 ]               Installing MediaWiki Installing to the root folder MediaWiki does not recommend installing directly to the root folder of your website because automated programs will eventually request certain files as they would an article.  For instance, googlebot crawls different websites and collects content from these sites to  build the searchable index used by Google's search engine.  To prevent MediaWiki from responding to these requests as if the files were articles, the  developers recommend installing the software to a subdirectory, or even a subdomain,  and then redirecting your domain, the way Wikipedia is set up. Unfortunately, if you are  using a shared web host, you will not have access to the files on the server that need to be  configured in order to set up a redirect for MediaWiki. Most hosting providers will set this  up a redirect for you if you request it. If they won't, you may have to install to the root.  Pop quiz – MediaWiki requirements quiz Well, you have skated along far enough. Time for you to start using your head and getting  involved! What better way to do this than to test your knowledge with a quick quiz.  1. Which programming language does MediaWiki require?  2. Which web server has MediaWiki not been successfully tested on?  3. What is a good tool to manage your databases with?  a. ASP.NET b. Visual Basic c. d.  PHP Fortran  IIS  a. BadBlue b. c. Apache d. Cherokee   SQL  a. b. A monkey-wrench c. d. phpMyAdmin  Perl extensions  If you have finished your quiz, we can get ready to move the installation files for MediaWiki  to our web server. As stated in the introduction of this chapter, there are many different  ways we can bring these files to our server. We are going to cover three different methods —using a script library, uploading MediaWiki using cPanel, and uploading   the files via FTP. This should cover any scenario you, as a beginner, may face.  [ 30 ]                                       Chapter 2  Using the Fantastico installer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ 31 ]               Installing MediaWiki  4.  Click on the location of the script library. This will open a categorical list of all the   programs available to you as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Under the Wiki category at the bottom of the page, locate MediaWiki and click on  it. This will start the installer script that will take you through the rest of the process.  [ 32 ]               6.  The next screen begins the installation process. Here, you will need to  provide the installer script with some necessary information as shown in  the following screenshot:  Chapter 2    First, you need to supply a username for the site's administrator  where it reads Admin User.   Next, you will need to supply a password for the administrator under Admin Pass. To make sure it is correct, you will type the  same password under Admin Password  Again .     Now, enter the e-mail address for the administrator. MediaWiki will use this as the default address to send administrative messages and  information about the installation process. Lastly, choose the Installation URL. By default, MediaWiki will cre- ate a subdirectory, or folder, called mediawiki, as the installation  location. You can change this to anything you want but it is best if  you name it something related to your wiki. If you have created a subdomain, you will have the option to choose it here as well.  [ 33 ]               Installing MediaWiki    Click on the Install button and when the installation is finished, you  will see something similar to the following screenshot:  What just happened? With a few simple clicks, MediaWiki was successfully installed onto your web server. Really, it was just that easy! While the installation using Fantastico may seem too good to be true,  other script installers can be as equally painless. If you are using another installer, you may find small differences between the steps provided here and what you see. A good example is  that many installers allow you to name the database that is installed with MediaWiki where Fantastico did not. If you used a script installer, you have two choices at this point: you can  either skip ahead to the Completing the installation section later in this chapter, or you can read along to see how MediaWiki can be installed using cPanel and FTP.  Username and password choices When choosing your username and password, make sure that you keep security in mind. While it may be tempting to use "Admin" or "Administrator" as the username, it is generally  not considered a best practice because it is too easy for someone else to guess. Your  password should also be something that is hard to guess. Security best practices dictate that  your password should be a strong password, which is made up of a combination of lower  case letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can test a password's  strength by visiting The Password Meter website at: http:  www.passwordmeter.com .  [ 34 ]               Downloading MediaWiki  Before we can go ahead and install MediaWiki with either cPanel or FTP, we need to get  ourselves a copy of the software. We do this by downloading a file called mediawiki-*. tar.gz, where * is the latest version number. You can obtain this file by opening your web  browser and entering http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Download in the address bar. Once you are there, click on the Download MediaWiki 1.15.1 link:  Chapter 2  When you click this link, you will be asked if you want to open the file or save it. Make sure  the Save File option is selected and then click OK.  [ 35 ]               Installing MediaWiki  Uploading files using cPanel  We have already seen cPanel to some extent when we learned how to install MediaWiki using Fantastico. Now, we are going to use the same tool to move the recently downloaded  MediaWiki files to our web server. While this alternate method of installation may require  a bit more knowledge, it gives you more control over the process. If you are installing to a subdomain, it is necessary that you create that before you start moving the files over.  Time for action – uploading MediaWiki files with cPanel To perform this series of steps, you need to log in to your cPanel account provided to you  by your web hosting company. Once you are logged in, you need to find the icon for File  Manager. If you refer back to the screenshot under the Time for action – installing the  software section, you can see that it is in the second row.  1. Click the File Manager icon to launch the program. This will open up a new window   listing all of the files and folders on your web server. Locate the subdirectory or folder, named public_html, and click on the folder, not the folder name, to open it.  2.  If you are moving the files to a subdirectory, click on Create New Folder. In this example, I am going to install in a folder called wiki. When you click on the Create button, the new folder will appear in the list to your left.  3. Open the wiki folder by again clicking on the folder, not the name. 4. Now we will move the files over to the server. Do you remember where you saved  it after downloading? Hopefully so, because when you click on Upload File s , you will see the following screenshot. Here you need to click on Browse to locate and select your mediawiki-*.tar.gz file. Once you have done this, click on Upload.  [ 36 ]               Chapter 2  The upload process may take some time depending on your network con- nection. Once it is complete, you will receive a message telling you that  the file has been uploaded successfully.  5. Now that the compressed files are uploaded to the server, we need to extract  them. Make sure you are in the directory where you uploaded your MediaWiki file. Click on the file mediawiki-*.tar.gz. On your right, you should see  a list of options; click on Extract File Contents. This will extract your files to a  folder named mediawiki-*. As this is not the right folder, you will need to move the files and subfolders to the directory that you set up for MediaWiki.  Like we saw in the Fantastico installation, we are only halfway done. Once we learn how to  send the files to our web server using an FTP client, we will continue with the installation.  You can skip ahead to that section, or you can read along.  [ 37 ]               Installing MediaWiki  What just happened? You just uploaded and extracted the MediaWiki software package to your web server using  cPanel's File Manager. If you are feeling a little impressed with yourself, you have every right  to. If you opted for this method over using a script installer, you gave yourself a bit of a head start as well. When it comes to bringing in third-party enhancements and extra themes to use with MediaWiki, you will be an old hand at it! All of the extras we learn about in later chapters require us to upload files to the server, so having this practice will make it a much  less intimidating process later on.  If after installing MediaWiki you find that there are errors that prevent you from accessing  your wiki, see the resources listed in Appendix C, Where to turn to. You will find multiple  avenues of support to help with any installation problems.  Uploading MediaWiki files with an FTP client  For our third and final method of installing MediaWiki, we will use an FTP client. FTP stands for  File Transfer Protocol and the client is a program that manages the file transfer for us. If you do not have an FTP client, you will need to download one to follow along here. I would suggest  getting a copy of Filezilla, which can be downloaded at http:  filezilla-project.org . Filezilla can be used on Windows, GNU Linux, or on Mac. On the scale of difficulty, this method  is on an even keel with using the cPanel File Manager.  Time for action – uploading the files Unlike using cPanel, uploading files with an FTP client requires you to extract the medi- awiki-*.tar.gz file before you move it to the web server. Use your favorite file archiving  tool, such as WinZip or 7-Zip, to extract the files to your computer. Make a note of where  they are because in a moment, we are going to start uploading them.  You may be required to create an FTP account on your web server before we get started. If  you are unsure how to do this, check with your hosting provider. They should be able to walk  you through the steps.  Now that we have extracted the files and our FTP account is ready to go, let's connect our  web server with our FTP client and complete the following steps:  1.  In your FTP client, navigate to the folder where you will be installing MediaWiki  in the Remote site section. If you want to install it to a subdirectory but  haven't created it yet, you can do so now using your FTP client.  [ 38 ]            2.   In the Local site section—your computer—navigate to the folder where you  extracted the mediawiki-*.tar.gz file.  Chapter 2  3.  Now, simply copy all of the files from the MediaWiki folder on your computer   to the target directory on your web server. This may take a little time.  What just happened? That's it, you have just completed the third method of getting the MediaWiki files onto your  web server! Using the FTP client gives you more control over the file transfer, like using  cPanel did. Unlike cPanel, FTP allows you to place the files into the directory you want them  in. It doesn't create a subdirectory that you have to move your files out of after they are  extracted since you take care of the extraction on your local computer.   Completing the installation  Now that we have covered the three ways in which we can get the MediaWiki installation  files onto our web server, we will go ahead and complete the process. No matter which  method you chose, everyone should now follow along together because the remaining  steps will be the same for all of us.  [ 39 ]            Installing MediaWiki  We will be:   Creating the database  Changing permissions on the config folder  Finishing up the installation process through our web browser  Time for action – getting everything ready In these next steps, we will work with the database and the permission settings on our  web server. These are the final steps before we actually install the software that we put  on the server.  Do you remember that when we compared MediaWiki to other wiki engines, we stated that one of the advantages of MediaWiki is that it stores articles, images, and other files in a  database rather than a flat file? This next step is where we create the database that will be  home to everything that will make our wiki great, the content!  If you moved the installation files over to your web server using a script installer like Fantastico,  your database may have been created already. To check this, we will be using the MySql  Databases section on cPanel. If you are using some other site management application, you  will need to access your databases using their method. Again, most site management tools are similar so you can apply the steps here to what your hosting provider uses.  1. Click on the MySql Databases icon to bring up the database management screen. If your database was created, write down the name of it as you will need it later.  2.  If you have no database for MediaWiki listed, you will need to create it now. Under the section named Current Databases, find the textbox next to New Database  and enter the name for your database. You can use whatever you want, but it  should be something that describes what data is being held there. For this demon- stration, I will be using MediaWiki. Once you have entered your new database's  name, click on Create Database.  3. Now, go back to the database screen. Under the Current Users section, enter the  name and password for the database administrator in the text boxes marked as  Username and Password. When you are done, click Create User.  4. Now we have to add the user we just created, to the database. Go back to the database screen and under Add Users to Your Databases, make sure that the correct username is matched with the database. Make sure that the Privileges are set to ALL and click the Add User to Database button.  [ 40 ]            When you have completed these steps, go back to the MySQL Account Maintenance screen and you will see something similar to the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  Have a go hero – use phpMyAdmin Using the database manager provided by your host is the easiest way to set up your database. If you really want a challenge, use phpMyAdmin to set up your database and user. This tool is a must for web developers and once you get used to the interface, you will  quickly see how easy and powerful this program is. You can download phpMyAdmin from http:  www.phpmyadmin.net.  Setting permissions Now that the database is set up, we need to set the permissions of the config folder on our web server to be writable. During the installation process, certain setup files will be written  to this folder. If we skip this step, the installation will not work properly.  1. Using your web host's control panel, open your file manager and locate the directory   where you uploaded your MediaWiki files to. Once you have located this, expand  the directory to see the files and folders it contains.  [ 41 ]            Installing MediaWiki  2.  3.  Locate the folder named config. This folder should have permissions set to 777.  If it is something else, like 755, you will need to change it. In cPanel, click on the folder and where the options are listed on the right side of the screen, select  Change Permissions. Set the permissions to 777. This allows the User, the Group, and the World to read,  write, and execute in the config folder. Click on the Change button to set the permissions.  After you click on the Change button, you will see the permissions for this folder change:  You can also use your FTP client to change permissions to your website as well. Try both  methods and use whichever one you feel is comfortable.  What just happened? By completing the previous steps, you altered your web server to accept changes made  during the installation process by allowing the software to write important files to the  config folder. We also successfully created a database that will be used to store your wiki's content.  The hard work is now done. From here on, we only need to sit back and let the installation  run. Oh, we will have to provide some information here and there  you still have your  database name and user information written down, right?  but compared to what we   just did, it will be a breeze.  Time for action – finishing up So far, we have moved all of the installation files to our web server, set the permissions on  the config folder so we can write to it, and created a database for MediaWiki content and other details. All that is left is to run the installation much like we would if we were installing  a copy of OpenOffice.org or GIMP on our computer at home.  The entire process is done through our web browser so before we get started, open your  web browser and type the location of your wiki in the address bar. As I am creating a wiki  in the root of my domain, I would type in http:  www.flosspropopulo.com.  If, however, I was installing to a subdomain named wiki, the address would be http:  wiki.flosspropopulo.com. Of course, if the installation was going to be  in a subdirectory named wiki, I would type http:  www.flosspropopulo.com wiki.  [ 42 ]            1.  After bringing up MediaWiki in your browser, you should see the following on   your screen:  Chapter 2  Click on the link that says set up the wiki. 2. After clicking on the link, the installation script will automatically check to make   sure the server has all of the required programs and settings. If everything is okay,  and you can proceed with the installation, the message Environment checked.  You can install MediaWiki will be shown in bright green at the bottom of the  section named Checking environment.... If there is something missing or wrong,  it will show a red error message instructing you to fix certain things before  continuing the installation process. You may receive warning messages and still  be okay to continue. This is normal and depends upon how your web host has  configured the server you are using.  [ 43 ]            Installing MediaWiki  3.  Scroll down to the section that says Site Config. This is the main installation process  file so make sure the information you enter is accurate. You will need to provide  the following:     Wiki name: This is a mandatory field and cannot be MediaWiki or  contain a . For the example used in this book, I will enter Floss Pro  Populo. You would enter your wiki's title. Contact e-mail: This is the e-mail address of the wiki administrator.  It is used to send information such as error reports and password  reminders. Language: Choose the language you wish to support. The default  is en-English. Copyright license: This describes how you wish to license  your content. If you are unsure, leave the default, No license  metadata checked.       Admin username and Password: These are the login credentials   for the Sysop account. The Sysop is a user with very high-level  system privileges such as locking and removing pages, blocking  IP addresses, and performing various setup tasks. You might be familiar with the terms owner and administrator for a site. Sysop is  a synonymous term for administrator and owner. Remember this information and keep it safe! Shared memory caching: If you have any shared memory set up for the server to cache pages, you can enter the information in the  shared memory option field. It is highly unlikely that this is the  case, so most likely, you will be leaving it set to No caching. This  topic will be covered later on in the book.    [ 44 ]            Chapter 2  4.  The next section is titled E-mail, e-mail notification and authentication setup.  These configuration settings enable general e-mail setup, user to user e-mail  system, and e-mail notification system setup. The installation file itself contains  good explanation for each of these options. In the demonstration, we will be  leaving all of the settings as defaults in this section. If you wish to disable any  e-mail communication for your site, simply select Disabled.  [ 45 ]            Installing MediaWiki  5.  Just like anything else, MediaWIki saves the best, or at least the most important,  for last. That's right, I'm talking about the Database config section. Do you  remember when I said, "Write down your database, database admin username,  and password"? You will need this to complete the next steps. If you need to get  that information again, obtain it from your web host's control panel. Once you  have that, we will need to enter it into the following:   Database name: The name of the MySQL database you   created earlier.   DB username: The username you set up earlier for accessing your   wiki MySQL database.   DB password: The user password you had set up for your   database user.   Database table prefix: This may be optional, but it is recommended   that you have a database table prefix. Providing a table prefix  allows you to install more than one wiki using the same database. For advanced users, this option also gives you the opportunity to  create MediaWiki tables under an existing database with the tables  distinguished by our desired prefix. Superuser account: This option provides a root password for the  database. You can provide the information if you have it. If you  don't, then leave the box unchecked and the field empty. There are four areas that you will leave as the defaults. The first  two you see, Database type and Database host should be left  alone. Also, the last two, Storage engine and Database character  set should be left as they are.      [ 46 ]            Chapter 2  6. After providing all the information, you are just a click away from finishing the in- stallation. Click the Install MediaWiki! button to start the process. If something is  wrong, then the server will come back to the setup page with an error message  telling you that something wasn't complete. If all the information provided is  correct then in a few seconds, you will see a success message in green at the  bottom of the page proclaiming Installation successful!  [ 47 ]            Installing MediaWiki  7. We're not quite done yet. During the installation process a file named   LocalSettings.php is created by the server and is located under the con- fig folder. To ensure that this file is created, we had to change the config  folder's properties to make the folder writable. Before clicking the link to  view the wiki homepage, move the LocalSettings.php file to the root  folder using your FTP program or a file management program like cPanel.  After doing so, you have to click on the link that reads this link and you will be taken to your wiki's Main page as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? That's right, that just happened! You successfully installed MediaWiki. By creating the  database, we were able to set up a home for all of the wiki's settings and the eventual  content that it will contain. Changing the permissions on the config folder allowed us,  or the installer at least, to write files essential to the installation file—the LocalSettings. php. Finally, we provided the information the installer needed to tie everything together.  We now have the main page to our wiki ready to be configured.  [ 48 ]            Chapter 2  Summary  Specifically, we covered:  We learned quite a bit in this chapter about installing the MediaWiki software on our  web server.   The essential software required to install and run MediaWiki. Without PHP, a   database like MySQL, and a web server such as Apache, we cannot run MediaWiki  on our server.   The bare minimum hardware requirements that our web server must have to install,   and properly run, MediaWiki.   How to bring the MediaWiki installation files to our web server so we can install the   software. We covered three specific ways of doing this, by using an installer script  called Fantastico, by using cPanel, and by using an FTP client.   How to create a database that MediaWiki will use to store configuration information   about the wiki as well as the content that drives visitors to the wiki.   How to change the permissions on one of the web server's folders. This was done to   allow the installer access to the folder during installation.  Once we covered all this material, we were able to successfully install the MediaWiki software on our server.  Now that we've learned about the installation requirements and steps, we are ready to cover  how to set up your new wiki which will be the topic of the next chapter.  [ 49 ]                      3  Getting to Know Your Wiki  Now that we have MediaWiki installed on the server, we get the chance to  really get hands-on with it and make some changes. Before we start creating  pages, we need to learn a few things about the layout of MediaWiki. Also, we  need to take some preliminary steps to customize the wiki not only to make it  our own, but also to make sure that no one gets in to deface it while we are still  learning the ins and outs of the software.  In this chapter we will learn:   How to navigate the Main Page  What the different menus do  How to log in to our wiki  How to create a new user account  How to make some basic customization changes to the look of our wiki  So if you are ready, let's get started.  Navigating the Main Page  Before we begin to write the content for our wiki, we need to understand the navigation  system used by MediaWiki. By having a solid understanding of this, we will be able to better  organize our content and give our visitors a great first impression that will have them coming  back for more.            Getting to Know Your Wiki  Now that the installation is complete, when we visit our site we are taken directly to the  Main Page of our wiki. Compared to a standard website, the Main Page serves the same function as the home page. The Main Page introduces the visitor to our wiki and the type  of content the wiki provides. It gives visitors a way to log in to our wiki, a way to create an account, and a way to navigate their way around the wiki itself. Of course, our wiki contains no content yet. To get a better understanding of what the Main Page does for the visitor, let's  take a look at the Main Page for Wikipedia found at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Main_Page.  Pretty impressive, huh? Now let's compare it to our Main Page. Type the URL of your wiki  into the address bar of your web browser. While it may not be loaded with content such as Today's featured article, and Did you know, the structure of our Main Page is similar to that of Wikipedia's.  [ 52 ]            We have divided the page in to six different sections for you. As you read on, we will discuss  each of the sections of the Main Page:  Chapter 3  1. Navigation Search 2. 3. Toolbox 4. Body 5. 6. Account area  Footer  By the end of this book, your wiki will begin to fill up with content as well. Once you have  completed the last section, take time to compare the Main Page for your wiki against  Wikipedia's again. I am sure you will be pleased with the results.  [ 53 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki  Have a go hero If you haven't noticed how the default Main Page is set up differently than Wikipedia's, take  a moment to go back and look over the screen shots.  Now that you see how the Main Page can be customized, go out and find some MediaWiki  wikis and see how they are set up. Did they keep the default organization, or did they  customize the Main Page to better suit their site?  You can check out the examples from Chapter 1, but you should search for some new ones on your own. Here are two that you can start with:  Joomla! Official Documentation: http:  docs.joomla.org Main_Page  Information Technology documentation for the University of South Florida: http:  wiki. acomp.usf.edu index.php Main_Page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Navigation                                                                                                                                                    [ 54 ]            Chapter 3  Community portal Remember that the main focus of a wiki is collaboration and community. With this in  mind, it makes perfect sense that a wiki would have a special page dedicated for providing information to the community called the Community portal. The community portal is a great  place to provide how-to's and guidelines for contributing to the wiki, post news, provide  to-do lists, and give your visitors other resources related to the community.  Remember, your community can be the general audience you have built if you are creating  a public wiki, or it can be the employees at your work if you are creating a wiki that will be  kept private. The following screenshot shows the Wikipedia community portal:  [ 55 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki Current events The Current events link takes you to a page that can be used to list both onsite and offsite  news. Current events pages may provide visitors with headlines for the day, a calendar, upcoming events, or maybe even a special call for content. It is important to remember that if you decide to use a current events page on your wiki, you have to keep it current! Don't let old events linger on this page. The following screenshot shows the current events  page for Wikipedia:  [ 56 ]            Chapter 3  Recent changes The Recent changes link will take you to a page that lists all edits that have recently taken place to pages on your wiki. As the sysop of the wiki, you will find this page extremely helpful  as you can track edits, monitor articles for mistakes, watch for inaccurate content, and keep  an eye out for vandalism to your wiki.  The Recent changes page is not only helpful to sysops and administrators though.  Contributors to the wiki can keep an eye on pages that they have created as well to see  what kind of changes have been made to their content.  The Recent changes page also represents the first special page that we encounter. Special  pages are created to perform a specific function in the software. Special pages are unique  in that they cannot be edited like other pages in the wiki. These pages can also have their  access restricted to users with specific privileges such as sysop or administrator. We will learn  more about Special pages later in the book.  [ 57 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki Random page The Random page link is pretty self-explanatory. Clicking on this link will take you to a  random page within the wiki. While it does not perform any specific purpose, it gives your  visitors a way to explore your wiki by visiting pages they may never have searched for.  Help The Help page allows you to create articles that help guide your visitors. You can provide  information on how to create an article, how to upload multimedia, how to create links, or  any other topic that you feel your visitors may need help with. Again, Wikipedia provides an excellent model for creating a help page as seen in the following screenshot:  [ 58 ]            Chapter 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [ 59 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki  Search If you want people to visit and use your wiki, it needs to be user-friendly. To accomplish this,  MediaWiki's developers included a search engine to the default installation. Instead of the  traditional placement of the search box in the upper-left corner, MediaWiki places it directly under the navigation box. The search box is made up of three components, the textbox, the Search button, and the Go button. To search for all pages related to a topic, visitors need only  enter the terms into the textbox and click on the Search button. MediaWiki then searches  all content for the term s  entered and responds back with a list of pages that it found. The  following screenshot shows the Search results for the term wiki:  [ 60 ]                                                                                           Chapter 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              [ 61 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki  When a piece of content  such as a page or article  links to another piece of content, what is known as a backlink is created. Those familiar with Search Engine Optimization  SEO  know that backlinks can help the search engines such as Google rank pages higher in the results. Seeing how many backlinks a page in your wiki has will help you know what type of content is more popular to your visitors, and will help you plan your SEO strategy much   more effectively.  Related changes The Related changes feature will show you, or your visitors, any recent changes to pages that are linked from the current page. Unlike the What links here feature, this one deals with outgoing links.  Visitors to your wiki can check to see if any pages they have referenced have been altered and authors can check to see if they need to update their pages to reflect changes made to  content they refer to. As with any of the other tools that allow you to see changes made to content, this gives the sysop another opportunity to review content that has been changed to make sure it is accurate. The following screenshot shows the various options available on  the Related changes page:  [ 62 ]            The previous screenshot shows us what the Related changes page for the Main Page looks like on a wiki that has some content written for it, the Joomla!

False  Body section The body section is where the meat of your wiki exists. This, of course, is the content. If you  look at the body of the Main Page, you will see a very basic, generic article. At the top of the  article, you will see four different tabs: article, discussion, edit, and history. If you are logged in as a registered user, you will see two additional tabs, move and watch. Each one of these tabs takes us to a different part of the page.   page: This takes us to the main content of the page. The page contents can be   edited by other users.   discussion: This section of the page allows the community to discuss topics   surrounding the page and article content. Maybe users will talk about current or  future changes, who will revise the document, or even what other content will be created that is related to this article.   edit: This section allows a user to edit the content of the article.  [ 64 ]            Chapter 3   history: This shows all of the changes to the article.  move: This tab is seen only to logged in users. This allows the page to actually be   renamed. If the newly chosen name is already in use, you will not be able to "move" the page.   watch: Clicking on the watch tab will add the current page to your watchlist. When   you click this tab, it also changes to read unwatch. Likewise, you can click on the unwatch tab if you no longer wish to watch the page. This tab is also only seen by  registered users. Users will be notified about changes to pages on their watchlist.  The word Main Page underneath the tabs is known as the title of the article. Below the title  and horizontal line is the main body section of the page.

The footer contains links such as About, Disclaimers, and the Privacy policy. Visitors can also see the last time the page was modified and how many times it has been accessed.  [ 66 ]            Have a go hero – make some changes We are going to learn how to create and edit articles in Chapter 4, Creating Content. However, if you are itching to get some pages up this is the perfect opportunity.  As the About page is already created by MediaWiki so when you click the link in the footer, the page shown in the following screenshot appears:  Chapter 3  Now you can click on the edit this page link or the create tab to get started.  Account section On the top, right-hand side of the Main Page you will find the heart of your wiki's  community, the Log in create account section. Although we created a sysop account when  we set up our wiki, let's take a moment and create a standard user account. Once we are done, we will log in and see some of the changes to the Main Page.  Time for action – creating a user account We are going to create a sample user account to see exactly what our visitors will see when they log in to our wiki. This account will come in handy later on when we want to test certain  features and extensions added to our wiki because it will allow us to view the wiki from a member's perspective rather than the sysop.  [ 67 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki  1. Click on the Log in   create account button in the top, right-hand corner of your   screen. You will be taken to the Log in create account page similar to the one  shown in the following screenshot:  2. As we are going to create a new account, we will click on the Create an account link. 3.  You are now taken to the Create account page. Fill out the necessary in- formation requested on this page. Before you click on the Create account button, make sure that the password for this account is not the same  one as your sysop account. In fact, make it as different as possible. This  is just a good security practice for anything that requires passwords.  4.  Now that you are set, go ahead and click on the Create account button.

The one item that defines this more than anything is the logo. When building a new  website, the logo is often the first task that is taken on because it gives the site its identity. To  really take the first steps into establishing this wiki as our own, we are going to go ahead and  change the logo to one that represents our site.  If you already have a logo, that's great. However, in order to replace the default MediaWiki logo, you have to make sure that the image is 135 pixels by 135 pixels. If you do not have a logo as of yet, you will need to create something to use in this chapter. In Chapter 11, we will cover different hacks for MediaWiki. Among these will be how to set up MediaWiki to allow  different sized images.  There are many free open source programs that you can use to resize or create your logo.  I would suggest using GNU Image Manipulation Program  or the GIMP  if you are used to Adobe Photoshop. If you prefer something along the lines of Adobe Illustrator or CorelDraw, then Inkscape would be a better choice for you. Both of these programs are free of charge  and can be downloaded from http:  www.gimp.org or http:  inkscape.org respectively.  We are going to cover two different methods of changing the logo. The first method requires  two less lines of code to be written into the LocalSettings.php file so it is a bit easier.  The second method requires a bit more code, and a bit more navigating of the file system.  The trade off is that the second method organizes your wiki how MediaWiki expects it to be.  Time for action – changing the logo method one Enough talk, let's make some changes! What we will be doing here is uploading an image  file to our server and then altering a PHP file in MediaWiki so that it knows where to pull the  new logo from. MediaWiki recommends that the logo be 135 pixels by 135 pixels in size, so if you haven't already done so, modify your logo to fit these parameters.  Let's get started.  1. Open up your FTP client, cPanel, or the file manager that your hosting company  provides you. If possible, try using a different method for uploading than you did  when we installed MediaWiki. This will give you more exposure to different tools.  2. Upload your logo file to the  images folder on your server. Usually, this is   found under public_html if you are using a shared host. If you are using your own server, you should be able to locate this folder under  var www html.  [ 70 ]            Chapter 3  3.  5.  6.  Locate your LocalSettings.php file. This too should be in the public_html  folder. Copy this file renaming it to LocalSettings2.php. We do this so in case we mess up we can always restore the original file.  4. Open the LocalSettings.php file for editing using a text editor such as Notepad  for Microsoft Windows or eMacs for GNU Linux. You may need to download this file  first depending on which tool you are using.  Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line of code: $wgLogo = " images yourlogo.png";  Make sure to change yourlogo.png to the filename of your actual logo.  Save your newly edited LocalSettings.php file. If you downloaded it prior to  editing, upload the file back to the original folder.  7. Open your browser and enter your wiki's URL into the address bar. You should now  see your logo in place of the placeholder that used to be there.  You can see the new logo appears right above the navigation box. Now, let's look at the second method we can use to change the logo with something that better represents  your site.  What just happened? By uploading a new image file for our logo and telling MediaWiki where to look for it, we are  able to change the logo that appears on our wiki. The first method we used was very basic,  but it calls for us uploading our image file to the same folder where our visitors will   upload images.  [ 71 ]            Getting to Know Your Wiki  Time for action – changing the logo method two The previous method was pretty simple right? This method is pretty easy as well, it just  requires you to dive a bit deeper into the filesystem and type a bit more code into the  LocalSettings.php file. This method is recommended by MediaWiki because it keeps the  logo file in folder where the system expects it to be. The previous method had us uploading  the logo file into the same folder where users too will upload their image files.  2.  4.  5.  1. Upload the file for your logo to the \skins\common\images folder using one of  the file transfer tools mentioned in the first method.  Locate your LocalSettings.php file and copy it. Rename the file to LocalSettings2.php. In the event something goes wrong, we can revert back to the original file.  3. Open the LocalSettings.php file for editing using a text editor such as Notepad  for Microsoft Windows or eMacs for GNU Linux. You may need to download this file  first depending on which tool you are using.  Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following lines of code, each on a  separate line:  $wgStylePath        = "$wgScriptPath skins";  $wgStyleDirectory   = "$IP skins";  $wgLogo             = "$wgStylePath common images yourlogo.png";  Make sure to change yourlogo.png to the file name of your actual logo.  Save your newly-edited LocalSettings.php file. If you downloaded it prior to  editing, upload the file back to the original folder.  6. Open your browser and enter your wiki's URL into the address bar. You should now  see your logo in place of the placeholder that used to be there.  What just happened? The second method used to change the logo requires a couple of additional lines of code,  and we have to navigate a bit deeper into our filesystem on the server when we upload our  image. However, using this method, we are keeping our wiki in line with how MediaWiki organizes files and folders.  [ 72 ]            Chapter 3  Summary  Specifically, we covered:  Congratulations, you have done something important! In this chapter, we learned about how  MediaWiki organizes pages and you took the first couple of steps in transforming MediaWiki  into your wiki.   The components of the Main Page  What the different links in the navigation box do by covering each feature individually  What the features in the toolbox do  That special pages are not able to be edited by our visitors as they are created by   the system   How users create accounts and how they log in to our wiki  Two different methods for changing the logo on our wiki  We also discussed how a page differs from an article to avoid confusion throughout  the book.  Now that we've learned the basics, we can start learning how to create content and really customize our wiki.  [ 73 ]                      4  Creating Content  We've done well so far learning about MediaWiki as a software package. In the  previous chapter we actually started working with our own wiki by changing  the logo. Now, we are going to begin creating actual content for our wiki. This  chapter is especially important because content is the reason your wiki exists in  the first place. If you are creating a wiki on a particular subject that you will be hosting for  anyone on the web to see, you need to make sure that your content is engaging  enough to build a large community that sees the importance of your wiki and is  compelled to contribute as well. The content you create in the beginning is the  foundation that will set the tone for your visitors. Maybe you are creating a wiki whose primary audience is looking to find out  more about a particular product or service. The content you provide your  visitors may determine whether or not they make a purchase or take part in  whatever service you are providing. Perhaps your wiki is a collection of internal documents for your company.  Again, clear, well-written content that is easy to access and find can determine  whether or not your wiki project is a success. If all the buzz around the water  cooler is how easy the wiki has made it for employees to find important  company information, you can smile and give yourself a pat on the back.            Creating Content  While we won't be able to give you lessons on how to craft content like a Nobel Prize  winning author, in this chapter we will teach you how to:   Plan a new page  Create a new page using the edit tab  Create a new page through a link  Create a new page using the search feature  Create a new page using the URL   Delete a page  Format content  Use HTML to format content  Create links to other content  So let's get going!  Planning for new content  Before we get started writing new content for our wiki, we need to think about a few things  first. While we may be tempted to jump right in and start writing, for the greater good of our  wiki we need to set a few ground rules for any content we create. In fact, this would make for a great page called Contributor Guidelines, don't you think?   Always search the site for a page before you begin to create it. As your wiki grows,   and the community expands, it becomes more and more possible that someone else had the same idea for a page as you. Searching for this page allows you to see what, if any, similar pages already exist. If there is nothing that mirrors the page you are thinking of creating, then go right ahead. If the page you were thinking about  does exist, then you have one of two options. First, you can edit the existing page  by making it better or by adding to it. The other option is to create a new page with  a different title that approaches the subject in a different way. For example, on  the FLOSS Pro Populo site, a page about MediaWiki would exist since it is a Free  Libre Open Source software package that is quite popular. Seeing that this page has  already been written, I may choose to create a new page called MediaWiki Hacks as  this isn't covered in the existing page.   Review changes before you save them using the Show changes button. This provides  you with a side-by-side comparison of what has been modified so you can make sure  that the changes you made are correct.  [ 76 ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chapter 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [ 77 ]   Creating Content  Creating a new page  Now that we know the rules for creating content, we are going to cover three different ways  to create a new page. However, we are going to start small so the first piece of content that  we actually create will be a simple edit of the Main Page to welcome visitors to our wiki.  Editing the Main Page As we are building the wiki from the ground up, we might want to start by changing the Main Page so it doesn't read, "MediaWiki has been successfully installed." It is important to think about what you want your Main Page to say before you start writing it because more often  than not, this will be the first thing your visitors see when they come to your wiki.  Time for action – editing the Main Page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       [ 78 ]            2.  Click on the edit link at the top of the Main Page. Clicking on the edit button to the   right will only edit the Getting Started section.  Chapter 4  3.  Type your welcome message for your visitors in the text. Notice that we have  changed the text between the  ''' '''  tags, but not the tags themselves. This is because we wanted the formatting in the welcome message to remain the same.  [ 79 ]            Creating Content  4.  Practice what we preach and click on the Show changes button. Now, we can see  how our changes compare to the original text. If you wish to see how the page  will look as it is formatted, you can click the Show preview button.  5.   If everything is up to par, then go ahead and click the Save page button and marvel at what you have accomplished!  What just happened? In the preceding task, we just edited the content of the Main Page to something more fitting  for our individual wiki. While a simple task indeed, we were able to familiarize ourselves with how content is created so that the upcoming lessons will be easier to understand.  Have a go hero Now that you have seen how easy it is to edit an existing page, give it a try on your own. The  About page on your wiki is currently an empty page. Locate the About button at the bottom  of your page and click on it to add some content telling your visitors what your wiki is all about. While you are at it, change the Privacy Policy and Disclaimers pages as well.  [ 80 ]            Chapter 4  Protect the Main Page You may remember that I had you log in to the wiki as the sysop. The reason is as the sysop  user, you can prevent others from making changes to the page you are working on using the protect tab. As the Main Page is what the visitors first see when they visit our site, we  don't want any vandalism to occur here. Think about how your visitors would feel if they  went to your wiki for some solid information and were greeted with something completely  inappropriate. To guard against this, we will change the settings so that only administrators  or sysops as they are also known  can edit and move this page.  Time for action – protect the Main Page Protecting the Main Page is a simple task. Follow along with the following steps and you will  have taken the first step towards guarding against vandalism.  1. Click on the protect tab. If you don't see this tab, log out and log back in under your   sysop account.  2.  4.  You should now be on the Change protection level for "Main Page" screen. In the first box, under Edit, select Administrators only.  3. Make sure that Administrators only has been selected under Move.

Type the title of the page you will create in the search box and click on the Go button.  Chapter 4  2.  Under the section that reads No page title matches, click on the create this  page link.  3.  Write your article. 4.  Enter a summary of your article in the Summary textbox at the bottom of the page.  5. Check the Watch this page box. This will allow you to see if anyone should edit your  page at a later date. If the content changes, you can go back and review it to make  sure it is accurate.  6. Click on the Show preview button to make sure that your article and page look the   way you anticipated. If there is anything that needs to be changed, you can edit   it directly.  7.  If everything appears correctly and you are happy with your page, go ahead and click on the Save page button.  After clicking on the Save page button, you will be taken to your newly-created page.  [ 83 ]            Creating Content  What just happened? After searching for our new page produced no results, we were given the option to create a  new page. After writing the new page's content, we previewed the results to make sure we  were happy with the content and we published the page to our wiki.  In the section of this chapter called Planning for new content, one of the guidelines suggested is to search for a new page before you write it. After completing this task, you can  see why this is the recommended method of creating a new page. If no results appear, you  have the option of creating the new page. If the wiki finds a page with your title already in  existence, you can move on to creating another page.  Unlike the Main Page that we recently edited, we did not protect this page. In the wiki which we are creating as a demonstration, we want to encourage community members to  collaborate on all of the content. Someone may have a better way of defining F L OSS, or  they may wish to add to the definition. By leaving this article open for editing, anyone can do  just that. There may be instances where you wish to protect your article from unregistered  users making edits. You can do this by choosing the option to Block new and unregistered  users under the protect tab. Of course, you may wish to protect the page from any and all editing by community members. After all, if your wiki is meant to host employee manuals, or  human resource documents, you may not want people making changes to the content. If this is the case, feel free to protect your page in the manner you see fit.  Have a go hero The beauty of MediaWiki's collaboration is that you can discuss pages with other community  members. Maybe you want to request additional content, or you want to make sure that  someone reads over a certain section for accuracy. You can make these requests, and leave  other notes using the discussion tab on your page.  Now that you have created a new page, add some items to the discussion section that you  feel are appropriate to your page. While you are at it, take a peek at the history tab to see what it looks like!  [ 84 ]            Chapter 4  Creating a new page using a wikilink Now that we have created the first new page in our wiki, we need to continue adding  content relevant to our topic. What better way to do this than to create new pages that are  linked to from our current page. These links between pages in our wiki are called wikilinks.  Creating pages through wikilinks is a great way to establish a web of information for your  users. These links allow them to easily follow a trail of related information. The following  steps will walk us through this process. With this in mind, it is easy to see why this method of creating a new page is the best because we already have at least one page linking to it, and  therefore our visitors have another means of finding the page.  Time for action – creating a new page using a link When creating a new page using a wikilink, we have to have an existing page open. Let's start  by finding a topic in the page we just created that would serve as a good page. Once you  have determined what you are going to create your next page about, we can get started.  It is important to let you know that we are going to jump ahead a bit in this section and  cover a bit of wiki syntax. To create a link to another page, you will need to enclose the text  in a set of double brackets. For example, if we wanted to create a link around the word wiki, we would type [[wiki]]. Don't worry about the syntax just yet; we will cover it further later on in this chapter.

[ 88 ]            Chapter 4  Deleting a page There will come a time when a page in your wiki is either outdated, or inadvertently created.  When this happens, you will need to delete the page to get it out of your wiki. This process is  just as easy as it is to create a new page.  Time for action – deleting a page Deleting a page wipes it out of your wiki but it still remains in the database. If you really want  to rid your wiki completely of a page, you will need to remove it from the database as well.  To delete a page, you need to be logged in under your sysop account. Once you are sure you  are the sysop, we can get started.  1. Navigate to the page you wish to delete. You can use the search box for this or you   can simply type the URL in the address bar if you know it. 2. Once the page is up, locate the delete tab and click on it.  3. Read the warnings that MediaWiki gives you. If you are still sure you need to   delete the page, select the Reason for deletion.                                                                                                      [ 89 ]            Creating Content  What just happened? When logged in as a sysop  or administrator  we can remove a page from the wiki by clicking on the delete tab at the top of the page. While this removes the page from the wiki, it can still be recovered as there is a copy that remains in the database.  Formatting pages  We have seen that creating pages in MediaWiki is extremely simple. Now, we want to make  the content on these pages a bit more readable, and a bit more exciting. Studies have shown  that when people are reading on the web, the text needs to be broken up into different  sections, you need to make use of bulleted text, and images go a long way. Luckily, we can  do all of this by formatting the text in our wiki content. Formatting content in our wiki is  done through wiki syntax, like we saw when we created our link. The syntax can be entered  directly into the editing page when we are typing our content, or you can use the edit  toolbar. We will cover how to use the edit toolbar shortly.  Wiki syntax Wiki syntax is a special set of markup characters that is used by MediaWiki for formatting  content. As we know, to show our content in a standard web page we use HTML tags for  formatting. MediaWiki itself is a web-based site, but it still has its own syntax and markup  rules. When a page is rendered, MediaWiki converts its unique markup syntax into the corresponding HTML syntax. So as a user, we don't have to know all the HTML tags to edit  our pages. The wiki syntax gives the flexibility to format the content with very easy-to-use  steps. The following chart shows the basic difference between some examples of commonly  used general text, HTML, and wiki syntax.

[ 90 ]            Chapter 4  So you can see, there are some distinct differences between wiki syntax and HTML. Learning  how to markup a wiki is not only easy to learn and apply, but as there is less code to type, there is less of a chance that you will make a mistake. The whole process is made to be user friendly.  The edit toolbar In most content management systems, you can markup the content on your site with a What You See Is What You Get  WYSIWYG  editor. The purpose of these tools is to allow  someone who doesn't know HTML to edit and format web content using a toolbar. As the  person writes their content, they can simply click the different buttons on the toolbar and  see their content change right before their eyes. What you see in your editor is exactly how it will show up on someone's browser. Think about Nvu, Adobe Dreamweaver, and Microsoft's  Expression Web Designer. These are extremely powerful WYSIWYG editing tools for  building websites.  MediaWiki, as an extremely user friendly editor, does not have a WYSIWYG editing tool. It  may look similar to the tools that most content management systems provide, and it has an extensive toolbar, but you are not able to see the formatted text as it would appear in your  browser. This is why I stressed previewing your pages before saving them, earlier!  We have already seen MediaWiki's editor quite a few times but we haven't done anything  with the edit toolbar just yet. The following table explains what each button does and  displays the corresponding wiki syntax:  Button   Function  Emphasizes text with boldface.   Emphasizes text with italics.   Creates a wikilink  internal link .   Wiki syntax '"text'"  "text"  [[text]]  Links to another web page.   [www.sitename.com]  Formats the text as a Heading 2.   ==text==  Adds an image to the page if the image has been uploaded to the site. Adds previously uploaded media, such as audio or video, to the page.  [[Image:picture.jpg]]  [[Media:file.ogg]]  [ 91 ]            Creating Content  Button   Function  Inserts a mathematical formula into the page.   Wiki syntax   formula      text    Marks the text to be ignored by MediaWiki when rendering the page, making it non-wiki text. For more on the   tag see the following section dedicated to it. Inserts your signature into the page to show that you contributed to the page. Your signature consists of your username  or IP address if you are not logged in  and a timestamp. Adds a horizontal line to your page.   --~~~  ----  Don't be fooled into thinking that this is the extent of formatting options available to you in  MediaWiki. These represent some of the most commonly used syntax available to you. Not  only is there a long list of available syntax to markup your content with wikitext, but you can combine formatting, and even make use of some HTML which we will see shortly. We will  cover a bit more about this in Chapter 5, Advanced Formatting, but for now, let's play around with the syntax available to us via the edit toolbar.  Time for action – editing text with the edit toolbar The editing toolbar is used for quick format changes and gives you some of the most commonly  used wikitext to work with. We are going to create a dummy page in the following exercise. Right after you have finished, feel free to delete this page to keep your wiki looking professional.  1. Create a new page in your wiki. I would suggest using the URL method since we   will be deleting the page anyways. Name the page "Sample".  2. Click on create to open the editing page. 3.  In the textbox, type Sample of Heading 2. Highlight this text and then click on the  Heading 2 A  button on the edit toolbar.  4. Hit return to add an extra line break and type bold. Highlight this and click on the   Bold B  button.  5. On the next line, type italics. After highlighting this, click on the Italics I  button. 6. Now type the word both. After you highlight this text, click on the Bold  B button.   Highlight it again and click on the Italics I  button.  [ 92 ]            7. Now hit return again to add another line break. On this line, type the words link   to something. Highlight and click on the Create link button.  8. Hit return to add the additional line break and add your signature by clicking on the   Signature button. Your Editing page should look like the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  9.  Since we know what the page will look like, click on Save page. Your page should  look almost exactly like the following screenshot. The only difference should be your signature.  Once you are satisfied with the results, go ahead and delete this page.  What just happened? Using the edit toolbar provided by MediaWiki, we were able to format the content of our page and add a signature at the bottom. We also learned something valuable. Unless we hit  enter for a carriage return, MediaWiki does not place the text on a new line even though in the editor, the text is listed vertically. If we wish to add a line break, we need to hit the Enter key. This takes the place of the   tag in HTML.  [ 93 ]            Creating Content  The nowiki tag You may have been left scratching your heads back there when we were talking about the  edit toolbars button. After all, why would an author want to tell MediaWiki to ignore all of  the content between the   and   tags?  If you were paying attention to the last activity, you probably can think of one reason right  off the bat why we would want MediaWiki to avoid parsing our content. Go back and look at  the previous two screenshots to see if you can figure it out. Don't worry, I'll wait.  Did you see it? If you answered quotation marks, then you get the extra credit question  right! If you are writing an article for your wiki and it includes a quote, say, "The Internet is  a telephone system that's gotten uppity", Clifford Stoll, what would we get when we click  on the Show preview button? We're going to get: The Internet is a telephone system that's  gotten uppity, Clifford Stoll. Why, because the " " tells MediaWiki to convert the text in between to italics.  Think that is bad, what about a wiki dedicated to teaching wikitext? Or one that exists for  web designers? All of the tags that would be used to teach the audience different things  would wind up turning a simple page into a nightmare.  As we have seen, the   tags take care of this. Now, if we type the following into our page:    One of the main differences between wikitext and HTML is how links are created.  In wikitext, you simply need to enter your link between two brackets like so [http:  www.packtpub.com].  HTML, on the other hand requires a rather long tag. The same link would be typed as such:   Packt Pub .     So, if now we can click Show preview and everything should turn out all right.  [ 94 ]            Chapter 4  Pretty cool, huh? You can also use the   tag of HTML to ignore both wikitext and HTML  tags in your article as well. Unlike the   tag,   does not reformat the text so new lines and spaces will not be removed. The next section will cover some additional HTML  tags that MediaWiki will allow you to use.  Formatting with HTML Formatting text with HTML has become quite popular. It is not uncommon to see e-mails,  newsletters, and other documents that have HTML tags inserted into them for formatting  purposes. MediaWiki is no exception. While most formatting is done with wikitext, you are  permitted to use a limited number of HTML tags for marking up a document in the editing  section of a page.  These are the HTML tags supported by MediaWiki:                                                                                                                             Any tags outside of this list will be ignored by MediaWiki. For instance, the   tag is not supported. If you trying to insert a picture into your wiki using the following tag:     [ 95 ]            Creating Content  You would wind up with the following result:  MediaWiki supports certain nested tags as well. Nested tags can be placed inside the wikitext to further enhance the formatting. This works especially well with tables and lists.  The nested tags that you can use are listed in the following table:                                          When using HTML, we often want to customize our tags using different options. For instance,  we may want to specify a color or our text, or we may want to align our text a certain way. This is done through attributes. And yes, MediaWiki allows for certain attributes:                                                                                                                 [ 96 ]            Chapter 4  Have a go hero So far we have created a couple of basic pages for our wiki. That's all well and good, but now  that we have seen how we can format our content using wikitext and HTML tags, it's time for  you to step up to the plate.  Before moving on to the next section, create a few pages that use the different types of  formatting we discussed. Make your fonts bold, or italics, or both. Add some quotes to make  use of the   tag. Scatter some HTML tags and attributes around.  Make sure to keep your design clean by not overusing all of the tags in one article, instead,  spread them out over a few pages using different tags in each. When you are done, we can  move forward.  Links  There are really no dead ends on the Internet. Likewise, your wiki should have no dead ends. In order for it to be a success, you need to build relationships between your content. These  relationships are built through links.  Think about Wikipedia for a moment. How many times have you landed on a page only  to find yourself wanting more, and satisfying that want by clicking on a link to take you  to another page, and then another. If you are like me, there are plenty of times you have  wound up reading about a topic that is entirely different from the original page you were  searching for.  To give your visitors the opportunity to extend their search, or even get lost in a world of  information, we are going to spend some time teaching you how to create links in your  content. We have seen how easy it is to create links using the edit toolbar. Using it, we can create internal links and external links. While using the toolbar is one way to create a link, knowing the correct syntax will make writing articles go by much faster. After all, isn't it a  tad bit easier to type two brackets around a word than it is to highlight the word, move the mouse to the button, click the button, and then move the cursor back to the text so you can  start typing again?  The following lessons should be applied to the articles you write from here on out, but don't  forget to go back and update the pages you have already created with what you  have learned.  [ 97 ]            Creating Content  Internal links As we have covered internal links earlier in this chapter, I am going to introduce you to a concept that MediaWiki employs called self linking. A self link is when a page contains a link to itself. When this happens, the link that is created appears in bold text and the link is not clickable. For example, say we are on the Main Page and we create a list of links to important pages in our wiki. It just so happens that the Main Page is considered as an important page, so it is included. The following screenshot shows what happens to the link:  Creating self links is something that you may not come across too often. After all, if you are  on the Main Page, odds are you won't be intentionally creating a link to the Main Page on  the page.  More often, you will come across indirect self linking. A indirect self link often occurs  through two instances; the first is when you set up a redirect and the second is when you  make use of a navigation template.  An example of a redirect is when you are on page A and you want to create a link to page  B, which is a related article. After a while, page B grows to take the place of page A so you  redirect page A to page B. The link to page B now becomes a self link and appears in bold  face. If the redirect is permanent, you can always edit the page to remove the link if you like.  In the case of a navigation template, you may create a series of links that will appear on five  different pages, A, B, C, D, and E. When you visit anyone of these pages, the collection of  links will appear. However, if you are on page E, the link to page E will be a self link and thus, appears in boldface. The links to all other pages will be normal. Should you click on the link  to go to page A, the self link will now appear for page A and page E's link will be a normal link. It may sound a bit confusing but when we discuss templates later on in this book, it will be much clearer.  [ 98 ]            Interwiki links                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Chapter 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [ 99 ]            Creating Content  Time for action – creating external links We are not going to use the edit toolbar for this task. Instead, we are going old school by hand coding our links into our new page.  1. Create a new page in your wiki. It can be whatever you like, just make sure it is   something that would contain external links. For demonstration purposes, we will  create a list of must have software so there will be multiple links on this page.  2. When you get to the place where you want to insert a link, type it between single  brackets. The code used for my site would look like this: [http:   www.gimp.com]  [http:  www.firefox.com]  [http:  www.openoffice.org]  [http:  www.videolan.org]  3. Notice the use of double spaces here. This is because we want a vertical list, not a  4. Once you are done writing, click on Show preview. If you created a list, it should  horizontal one.  look something like this:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [ 100 ]            Chapter 4  What just happened? Using wikitext, we learned how to create an external link to another site. We saw that when we create an external link, it shows up as a number. In the next section we will learn how  to change this, but for the time being, we added some text before the link to let our visitors  know where the link would take them.  External links are not limited to only Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP . Other protocols  supported are:  HTTPS  FTP  Gopher  NEWS  mailto  IRC  Fixing your external links The truth is, people are used to clicking on a link that contains words, not a number. The  manner in which MediaWiki displays external links could be confusing to your visitors. As we are building our wiki to make things easier for our visitors, we need to change this.  There are actually two ways to go about changing this. The first is to add a label after your  link that looks like this:  [[actual_link  link_label]]  So if we were to change our link for OpenOffice.org we would type:  [http:  www.openoffice.org OpenOffice.org]  Our page will show OpenOffice.org as the link instead of a number as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 101 ]            Creating Content  The second way to display our external links in a more user friendly format is to simply type  the URL into the text. That's right, if we type http:  www.openoffice.org directly into the page without the brackets, it will create a more friendly list that looks like the  following screenshot:  While this manner of changing the way your external links look works, it's not as descriptive  as the first method. For instance, if you don't know that http:  www.videolan.org will take you to the VLC media player, it could still be confusing to your visitors.  Have a go hero Now that we know how to make our external links more user friendly, go back and change any links that still show up as a number.  Summary  In this chapter, we covered quite a bit of material that focused on the heart of our wiki, the content. We learned that we write articles for our wiki and these articles are contained in the  pages that we create. We also learned how to go about making our content more attractive  to the reader through different formatting techniques. Even though this chapter contained a  great deal of information, specifically we covered:  The different ways we can create a new page  How to write content for our pages  How to delete a page  How we can use the edit toolbar to format our content  How we can format our content using wikitext and HTML  How to create links to other pages and sites  Now that we've learned about creating content, we are ready to tackle the challenge of using  advanced formatting techniques to enhance the quality of our wiki's appearance. In the next  chapter, we will be doing just that.  [ 102 ]            5  Advanced Formatting  We learned in Chapter 1 that wikis have been around for some time now. As we  have progressed through the book, we have seen how wikis are a great way  to share content in a true social media setting. However, this is not the days of  WikiWikiWeb! Nowadays a site's audience expects structured, colorful content  rich with images, video, and audio. That's what we are going to give them.   Some of what we are going to cover includes:   How to create anchor links  How to organize content into lists  Organizing content into tables  Using mathematical formulas  Using magic words to format your wiki  Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work.            Advanced Formatting  Anchor links  One of the most useful features of MediaWiki is the ability to create anchor links on a page. Anchor links, also called anchors, allow us to link from the current page to another section  of the same page. Confusing? Let's see if this clears it up for you. Suppose we are on a page where we have lots of subsections and there is a link to each subsection in the table of  contents. When we click on the link for the subsection, the page automatically scrolls down  to that section. Most often we see these links in the Table of Contents of a page, as seen in in the following screenshot:  The links in the Contents box in the previous screenshot are the anchor links to the different  subsections of the page. By clicking on any one of these links, you will be taken to that  portion of the content. This is great if you only need to read a small section of a long article.  So let's create some anchors on a page in our wiki.  [ 104 ]            Chapter 5                                            Time for action – creating anchor links                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [ 105 ]            Advanced Formatting  Once you are finished, your page should look something similar to the following screenshot:  What just happened? Using the appropriate wikitext, we edited a page to contain various section headings. Once  we had all of our sections and subsections marked up appropriately, we used another piece  of wikitext to create anchor tags to these sections so our visitors can jump directly to the  area of the page that they are looking for.  By creating these sections, we also did two things. The first is that we added an [edit] link  to each section subsection of our page that can be found to the right of the heading. This  allows our visitors to open only that section for editing so they don't have to wade through  the entire page's content. The other by-product of creating sections is that if we have three  or more sections and or subsections, MediaWiki creates a table of contents for us at the top  of the page.  Additionally, we added the pipe    to the wikitext. This is done because [[anchor name]] is the actual wikitext that creates an anchor. However, when this is used without the , the result on your page is Anchor name. As we don't want the  sign to precede our text, we use the  and add the text we want to appear after it.  [ 106 ]            Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [ 107 ]            Advanced Formatting  Unordered lists An unordered list is a list that is not preceded by numbers or letters. Instead, each item  in the list is offset by a bullet, usually a circle or square. In the Lists section, we used an  unordered list to explain the three types of lists we will be talking about in this chapter.  Time for action – creating an unordered list Creating an unordered list in your wiki is really easy. Use the asterisk  *  sign at the beginning of each line for creating a list element. The number of asterisks you add before the line will  indicate the level of the list element in the unordered list. For example, two asterisks  **  will indicate a second-level list element. Three asterisks  ***  will indicate a third-level list element, and so on.  If you wish to start another list on your page, put a line break  an empty line  at the end of the first list and then start another list with a top level asterisk  * .  1. Create a new page in your wiki that will involve a list. 2. On your page, type your content. When you are ready to add your list, hit Enter to  add a line break.  3.  Start your list with an asterisk. Add additional lines to the list with two or three  asterisks, depending on the level.

After you have saved your page, your lists should look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 109 ]            Advanced Formatting  What just happened? Using wikitext, we were able to create an unordered list to help break up a page on our wiki. Additionally, we were able to create a multi-level unordered list by adding additional  asterisks before each line. The asterisks being the syntax used to create the list.  We can make use of the   and   tags that creates a list in HTML if we choose. However,  if you are familiar with HTML, then you know that each   tag needs to be closed with a   tag and the syntax can look messy on the page and while it is good practice to close  the   tag with   even if it is not necessary. Consider the following code:      Office suites   Multimedia tools   Security software   Web browsers   And many others     Using the wiki syntax, we are able to create a list in a simple manner that is easy to read if someone else needs to edit the page.  Ordered lists Ordered lists are used when we want to have a 1, 2, 3, and so on in front of each line on the list. These are usually used to designate steps or levels of importance. Creating ordered lists  on our page is just as easy as it was to create an unordered list.  Time for action – creating an ordered list When creating an ordered list, we will use the hash    sign for each list element. Similar to  an unordered list, we can create a second-level list using two hashes    and a third-level list using three hashes   .  If we need to create multiple lists, we would need to insert an empty line between them as  we did with the unordered lists.  1. Open a new page in your wiki where you will be creating an ordered list.  Begin typing your content. When you are ready to begin your ordered list, enter a   2. hash before each line. Your list should look like this:  Windows   Mac  GNU-Linux  Unix  [ 110 ]            Chapter 5  3.  Start typing a multi-level list using multiple hash signs at each line.

After saving your page, it should look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 111 ]               Advanced Formatting  What just happened? Instead of creating a list that is separated by bullets, we used the hash sign    to create an  ordered list that includes successive numbers before each list element. We also learned that by using multiple hash signs before a list element, we can create a multi-level ordered list.  Using HTML for ordered lists When creating a basic ordered list like we did in the previous example, we would want to  avoid using HTML tags for the same reasons we avoided them with our unordered list. There  is quite a bit more typing that needs to be done, and someone who is unfamiliar with HTML  may have a hard time editing the page.  One instance where we may want to use HTML syntax with an ordered list is when we wish  to create a list where we use sequential letters instead of the default sequential numbers.  Let's use the multi-level list we created in the last example.

Let us take out the 1 and 2 next  to Windows and Mac and use a capital A and B instead. To do this, we need to define a type attribute for the top-level   tags. By setting the type=A, we are able to change from a number to a capital letter.

You can use any text editor to create an HTML file. Just be sure  to save it with the .html or .htm extension. After you have saved the file, you can preview  it in any browser to see how it looks.  Definition lists Definition lists are great for creating glossary-type listings for your wiki. As the name  suggests, a definition list creates a list of terms with the corresponding definitions. These  types of lists are not formatted like the unordered and ordered lists we just worked with.  Instead, they are typically displayed with the terms on the left side of the pages, and the  definition on the right or directly below it.  Time for action – creating a definition list Wiki introduces people to free and open source software, so we need to have a glossary  for all the newcomers  we don't want to scare them away by calling them newbies . When creating a definition list, the wiki syntax must follow certain rules:   Each definition term should start on a new line  To indicate a definition term, a semicolon  ;  is used at the beginning of the line  To indicate the definition, a colon  :  is used at the beginning of the definition text  So let's get started with our glossary.  1.  Open a new page in our wiki where we will create the glossary. 2.  Enter the list of words, and make sure you include a semicolon before each.  [ 114 ]            Chapter 5  3.  Follow each word with its definition. Make sure to place a colon before you begin   to type the definition. Each word should appear in a format similar to the following example:  ;copyleft  :Term used for the copyright agreement and license statement  created by Richard Stallman for software developed under the GNU project.  Software under this license allows you to receive and use the source code of the software to which the license applies.  Additionally, you are permitted to redistribute the licensed software and to make derivative works provided that the source code of the derivative is also made available under   similar conditions.  To begin your next glossary term, hit Enter to go to a new line.  4. 5. Continue the process until all of your terms have been entered into your glossary.  When you are done, click on Show preview to view the page. Click on Save page  when you are satisfied.  If you followed along with the instructions, you should have a page that looks something like  the the following screenshot:  [ 115 ]            Advanced Formatting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ 116 ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [ 117 ]                              Advanced Formatting  4.

As we are trying to create a site  that people actually want to visit, let's dress this table up a bit to make it more read- able. We are going to add a caption using the plus sign  + , and then we are going to  alter the column and row headers using an exclamation point  !  and double  exclamation points  !! .  9. Go back to the editing section of your page. Add a new line underneath the   opening {. The new line will have a + in front of it.

Under the line containing the caption, type the following:   ! !! Windows !! Mac !! GNU-Linux.  12. Replace the wiki-pipe before each number in the table with an exclamation point.   This single exclamation point will make each number stand out as well. Now, our syntax should look like the following. Note the changes that appears in bold:  {  +Best FLOSS Applications by OS !  !!

It should look something similar to the following screenshot:  What just happened Using wikitext, we were able to organize our content into a table. As the original table was too plain, we dressed up the content a bit using the plus +  sign to give our table a caption,  and exclamation points to distinguish our header row and column from the rest of the table.  What we did in this exercise is build a foundation for creating tables that we are going to  build upon in the following exercises.  Styling your table When we added the caption and formatted the headers on our table, we made it look a  bit better but let's face it, it still looks like an old dial-up served page from the early 1990's.  Lucky for us, we can give this table a bit more of a modern look.  As we have seen, wiki syntax supports many HTML parameters which are also known as  attributes. As we are about to see, one of the most important attributes that it supports is  the style attribute. We will use this extensively as we format our table and cells. We have  seen which HTML tags are supported earlier in the book. When using HTML parameters, we  need to keep the following things in mind:  [ 120 ]               Chapter 5   To add parameters to a table, we can use the style parameter to define properties   related to the table.   To add parameters to a cell, we can add a parameter list after the line symbol  and   close the parameter list using another line symbol . We then put the value of the cell after that. The syntax will look like this:  Parameter  value.   We can directly put HTML tags such as  ,  , and so on, inside the cell.  When we add parameters to a table, we must keep a space between the parameter  list and the table opening syntax.  Some of the style parameters we can define in MediaWiki are: color, width, height, cell spacing, cell padding, font color, font size, alignment, and so on. We are going to use some of these to make our table really stand out on the page.  Time for action – formatting our table In this example, we'll go back to the table we have been working with and using CSS apply some style attributes to it. Using these, we will define the background and foreground  colors, and the height and width of the table. We will also go ahead and apply cell padding and change the spacing of our cells.  1.  Open up the table we have been working on and click the edit tab. 2.  Edit the first line  where the table opening syntax of { is  to read:  { style="background:cccc99;color:black;width:80%;"  border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center" 3.  Change lines 4 and 14 to read - style="background:white; color:black". 4.  Change line 9 to read - style="background:f0f0f0; color:black".  Your complete table syntax should now look like this on the editing page:  { style="background:cccc99;color:black;width:80%;" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center" +Best FLOSS Applications by OS  ! !!

Click on Show preview.  When you preview your page, you should see something like this:  Now that table looks good! You can play around with the colors if you like. Once you have found a scheme you are happy with, save your page and we can move on!  What just happened Using HTML parameters, mainly the style attribute, we were able to take our plain  table and make it much more aesthetically pleasing. We were able to change the color of  the background, the table width, the cell padding, the border, the cell spacing, and the alignment. More importantly, we were able to make our wiki look much more professional to our visitors.  Nested tables When you visit Wikipedia, you may notice that their Main Page has different sections such  as Today's featured article, In the news, and Today's featured picture. But how do they split the page up like that? The answer is nested tables.  [ 122 ]               Chapter 5  As the name implies, a nested table is a table inside of another table. The table actually  resides in the cell of another table. If we look back at the Wikipedia Main Page, we can view the source code that creates this by clicking on the view source tab at the top. While it looks rather complicated, we will see just how easy it is to make our Main Page look just like this.

You will need to have access to your  LocalSettings.php file to do this, so make sure that you have cPanel or your FTP  program for this exercise. We have made changes to this file before so you shouldn't be  worried about this at all.  1. Using either cPanel or your FTP program, open up the backend to your site. 2. Navigate to your public_html folder and expand it. 3. Open your LocalSettings.php file for editing. 4. 5. Change the word false to true. 6.  Find the line that reads $wgUseTeX = false;.  Save your changes.  What just happened? By going into the filesystem of our website, we located the LocalSettings.php file and  made the necessary change to enable TeX markups on our wiki. Now, we can go ahead and use  the   tag to insert mathematical symbols. We also learned that even if we enable this,  we still have to have our hosting provider install TeX and provide us with the path, so we can  define this also in our LocalSettings.php file where it reads $wgUseTeX = false;  Magic words  Magic words are a few reserved words that are used for special purposes in MediaWiki. They are used to create special types of formatting. We can use magic words to show table  of contents, display the current date and time, and so on. Programmers sometimes refer to  these as reserved words.Magic words are divided between behavior switches and variables. Behavior switches control the behavior and or layout of the page. They are often used to specify  desired omissions and inclusions in the content. For instance, if we wanted to remove the table of contents from a particular page, we could put the magic word _NOTOC_ on our page and the table of contents will be removed for us. Likewise, we can force a table of contents to appear with the _FORCETOC_ or _TOC_ magic words. Magic words that are behavior switches are shown in the following table:  [ 130 ]               Magic word   __NOTOC__   __FORCETOC__   __TOC__   __NOEDITSECTION__   __NEWSECTIONLINK__   __NONEWSECTIONLINK__   __NOGALLERY__   __HIDDENCAT__   __NOCONTENTCONVERT__ or __NOCC__  __NOTITLECONVERT__ or __NOTC__  __INDEX__   __NOINDEX__   __STATICREDIRECT__   Chapter 5  Explanation Hides the table of contents  TOC . Forces the table of content to appear at its normal position  above the first header . Places a table of contents at the word's current position  overriding __NOTOC__ . If this is used multiple times, the table of contents will appear at the first word's position. Hides the section edit links beside headings. Adds a link beside the edit tab for adding a new section on a non-talk page. Removes the link beside the "edit" tab on pages in talk namespaces. Used on a category page and replaces thumbnails in the category view with normal links. Used on a category page and hides the category from the lists of categories in its members and parent categories  there is an option in the user preferences to show them . This tells wikis with language variants not to perform  any content language conversion  character and phase  in article display; for example, only show Chinese  zh  instead of variants like zh_cn, zh_tw, zh_sg, or zh_hk.  On wikis with language variants it tells them not to perform language conversion on the title  all other content is converted . Tells search engines to index the page  overrides $wgArticleRobotPolicies, but not robots.txt . Tells search engines not to index the page. On redirect pages, doesn't allow MediaWiki to automatically update the link when someone moves a  page and checks "Update any redirects that point to the  original title".  [ 131 ]               Advanced Formatting  Variables are those magic words which provide specific information about a page, wiki, or  the date time. Variables are used between {{ and }} tags and they are called variables because they are always changing.  The list of variable magic words is quite extensive and can be found at  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Help:Magic_wordsVariables.  Time for action – inserting a magic word Some interesting magic words to use are the number of pages and local timestamp variables.  We are going to go ahead and place these two magic words on our Main Page.  1. Open your Main Page for editing. 2. At the bottom of the page, type the following:   Number of pages in this wiki: {{NUMBEROFPAGES}}.  3. Drop down two lines and type: {{LOCALTIMESTAMP}}. 4. Click on Save page.  The bottom of your Main Page should now have something similar to the following screenshot:  What just happened? By inserting magic words into our wiki, we were able to display information to our visitors.  The screenshot shows us that we have 11 pages in our wiki at this time. Below that, we see  that the current server time is August 9, 2009, 8:08:54pm EST displayed as 20090809190854. This will be continuously updated, thanks to the variable magic words we used. Using magic  words, we can also alter the behavior of a page, or the wiki itself.  We can also make use of some other magic words that allow us to track a page's revisions or even the number of page views. These can be especially helpful when you are creating a wiki  for a collaboration project and you need to make sure you have the latest revision.

It is un- common nowadays to find a site that does not include images, videos, or  audio to help relay information to its visitors. MediaWiki allows you to do the same with your wiki. You can create image gal- leries to show off pictures of a corporate event, an audio file can playback an  important speech for a wiki that provides information, and video can be used to  demonstrate techniques on a wiki developed for e-learning.  In this chapter, we are going to learn how to harness all that multimedia has to offer to our  wiki. Specifically we will cover:  How to upload images  How to create an image gallery  How to embed audio files  How to embed video files  So let's open up our wiki and get started.               Putting the Media in MediaWiki  File uploading  Before we can do anything with multimedia files, we have to first cover uploading files. If  you are familiar with sites such as Wikipedia, you may have seen the Upload file link in the toolbox as shown in the following screenshot:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [ 136 ]               Time for action – enabling file uploads In order to enable file uploads, we will have to edit the LocalSettings.php file again. You  will need to use a file manager, such as cPanel or your FTP program to modify this file.  Chapter 6  1. Open up the tool you will be using to modify your LocalSettings.php file  and navigate to it. Remember, it is usually found in the public_html folder.  2. Open the LocalSettings.php file for editing. 3. 4. Change the word false to read true as shown in the following screenshot:  Locate the line that reads $wgEnableUploads = false;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ 137 ]               Putting the Media in MediaWiki  Uploading images  Images will probably be the most commonly used type of multimedia on your wiki. By default,  MediaWiki only allows for certain image files to be uploaded to a site. These files are: JPEG or  JPG  Joint Photographic Experts Group , PNG  Portable Network Graphics , and GIF  Graphics Interchange Format . Other common file formats, such as TIFF  Tagged Image File Format  and  BMP  Bitmap , require modifications to the configuration file which we will cover later.  MediaWiki also limits the size of the file you can upload to 8 MB. This too can be changed,  however you have to keep in mind that if you are using a web hosting provider, your storage  space is limited. Allowing larger files will use up that space more quickly. Also, larger files  require greater bandwidth usage when they are displayed. With hosting providers, if you  exceed your maximum bandwidth for a period of time your site may not be displayed until  the account is reset  usually every month , or you may be charged extra for exceeding your limit. You also need to remember that larger files take longer to load on your page. If a page  is loaded with multiple large image files, visitors may become frustrated by having to wait to  view the content they are looking for and choose another site. The point being, increasing  the size limit may seem like the cool thing to do for your visitors, but weigh the ramifications  before doing so.  Time for action – uploading an image                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [ 138 ]               1.  From the toolbox, click on the Upload file link. You will see a page as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 6  2. Click on the Browse... button to locate your file. 3. When you have found the right file, select it. 4. When you select the file for uploading, the Destination filename will be populated   using the original filename for the image. If you wish to change this, do so by  modifying the text in the Destination filename box.  5. Add a summary of the image in the Summary textbox. This step is optional,   but can be helpful later on when trying to find different images.  6. Click on the Upload file button.  [ 139 ]               Putting the Media in MediaWiki  Once you have uploaded the file, you will be taken to the file's information page as shown in  the following screenshot:  What just happened? Using the Upload file feature we just enabled, we were able to upload an image to our wiki's  database. This file can then be used on any page in our wiki, and can even be downloaded by  the wiki's visitors.  We can view a list of uploaded files by navigating to a special page named File list. From the toolbox, click on the Special pages link. Now, scroll down to the section titled Media reports  and uploads. Then, click on File list and you will be brought to a page that lists the files that  have been uploaded to your wiki along with information about the files as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 140 ]               Chapter 6  Existing file names Before uploading files, you should always use the File list page to see if a similar image has been uploaded already  hence the need for the summary , or if there is already a file with  the same name you intend to save your new file as in the Destination filename textbox. By entering a file name in the Search for media name box and clicking on Go, you can search for a file with a name similar to the one you wish to upload. You can sort the different files  on this page by clicking the column header for Date, Name, and Size. Once you have selected a column to sort by, you can choose either ascending or descending by clicking on the arrow next to the sort field.  If you do upload a file and try to save it as the same name as an existing file, you will be  alerted to this with the Upload warning page.  The Upload warning page will tell you that:  A file with this name exists already, please check Image:imagefilename.extension if you  are not sure if you want to change it.  You then have the option to Save file which ignores the warning and saves the file anyway,  or to Re-upload and return to the upload form to make the appropriate changes. Remember, authors usually watch their pages so they will be alerted to changes to the images. This  fact combined with being a good administrator means that if something is uploaded inappropriately in place of an existing image you will most likely catch an instance where  someone overwrites an image file. As you can always revert to the original file using the  history tab, you shouldn't worry too much about this.  Inserting an image onto a page Now that we have uploaded a file, we need to get it onto one of our pages. Using the example  wiki we are building in the exercises, we will go back to the Main Page to do just that.  When you look at the Main Page of FLOSS Pro Populo, you may remember we created nested tables in the last chapter. In the bottom table, we included a section called Top Downloads where we highlighted Ubuntu. When we created this table, we had not yet learned how to upload and embed an image into our page so we included the text, Insert logo here. Now, we are ready to fix that.  [ 141 ]               Putting the Media in MediaWiki  Time for action – uploading an image onto a page Well, we have our image uploaded and a page ready to be graphically enhanced, so let's get to it.  1. Open up the page where we want to insert our image and click on the edit tab. 2.  Find the location where you wish the image to be placed and type the code:  [[Image:imagename.extension]]. For example, we are going to insert the Ubuntu logo on our Main Page. The file name is UbutnuLogo.png so we will type: [[Image:UbuntuLogo.png]].  3. Once your image has been placed, click on Show preview. Don't click on Save page   just yet.  When we insert the image, we may not yet be satisfied with the end result.  The image looks nice, but the size is a bit disproportionate and I think it could use  a caption so that in case someone can't view the image, they will be able to read a  description of it. So let's add the caption and make the image a thumbnail instead  of the full-sized graphic:  4. Go back to the Image line on your page.

You can do other things as well. Try to center your image by using  center placed after the image name, or make the thumbnail image 100px with 100px inserted after the thumb. Use the Internet to find some other attributes you can add to your  images as well. W3 Schools, http:  www.w3schools.com, is a great place to start.  Creating an image gallery If you have used content management systems in the past, one component or extension you almost always find yourself looking for is one that displays multiple images in a gallery format.  With MediaWiki, this feature is built-in so there is nothing more we need to install or activate.  Galleries in MediaWiki are built using the   tag. When used on a page, it creates four columns of thumbnails for us. This is great for any scenario where we need to display  multiple images at once.  Time for action – creating a gallery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [ 144 ]                                 6.

Completing these exercises were a big step in your development as a wiki administrator. Not  only did you handle installing your first extension, but you provided a whole new medium for  content on your wiki, Flash videos.  By uploading a .swf file to your wiki's database, you made it available for your users to  display the video on a page. Creating a new page, we used the   tag to insert this movie file onto our page to be played for our visitors. Also, we were able to modify how a  movie is displayed on the page by learning about some of the different attributes that can  be used with the   tag.

By downloading and installing the OggHandler extension, we were able provide greater functionality in our wiki that allows us to play audio, and even video, files using the Ogg  format. These files can be played directly in our wiki's pages so our visitors do not have to  download the files or install any new software to play them back.  We also edited our LocalSettings.php file to not only tell our wiki to look for the  OggHandler extension, but also to allow our visitors to upload Ogg files as well. We also  added a few extra file formats to the permitted file formats such as doc, xls, ppt, and so on. Now, our visitors can upload other files as well and include links to them in any pages  they create.  Time for action – embedding Ogg files As stated earlier, Ogg is not limited to audio files. While it produces a better quality audio file  than MP3, it can also be used for video files as well.  Now that our wiki is ready for us to use audio files, we need to learn how to embed them  into our pages. Make sure you have at least one Ogg sound file for this exercise. If not,  you can find some at Wikimedia Commons: http:  commons.wikimedia.org wiki  Main_Page. That is where I found the file Tremolo_Picking.ogg that I will be using.  To embed a file that has been uploaded, we will be using the [[File]] wikitext.  1.  Using the Upload file link in the toolbox, upload your Ogg file to your wiki. 2.  Open a new page for editing.

We saw how  to upload and embed images into our wiki's pages, giving our visitors images that can be related to our content. We also saw how we can embed Flash movies into our wiki's pages to give our wiki even more ways to teach, train, and entertain our visitors. Finally, we saw how we could add Ogg files to play back both audio and video on our wiki.  Most importantly, we took another step forward in building our administrative skills when it  comes to MediaWiki. In this chapter, we learned how to install extensions in our wiki to give it even more functionality. We will deal with more extensions throughout the book and even  see some of the most important extensions for our wiki. But first, we need to understand  how to organize all of this content we are starting to create. In the next chapter, we will see  how to do just that!  [ 154 ]               7  Organizing Your Wiki's Content  Until now, we have focused mainly on creating content in your wiki. By this  point, you should have quite a few pages in your wiki as a result of completing  the exercises in this book. As our wiki grows in popularity the amount of content  it hosts will continue to grow so it is important to organize the content, so that  our wiki looks better to our visitors and editing and reviewing content is much  easier for our users. If we think of our wiki as a library, it is easy to see why  we need to organize it. After all, if you walk into a library with no system for  organizing the books, movies, music, periodicals, and other items, you would  find it hard to locate what you are looking for. Likewise, if we have no order in  our wiki, then our visitors could find themselves frustrated when trying to find  the information they are looking for. If they become too frustrated, they will   go elsewhere.  MediaWiki has many built-in features that will not only help us keep our content organized, but make it extremely easy to do this. In this chapter, we will learn how to make use of these tools including:   How we can create namespaces  How to create categories  How to set up a template for our users  Why we would redirect a page  How to move and swap a page               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  Namespaces  Namespaces are used by MediaWiki to group together pages that have a similar purpose such as help pages, user profiles, or talk pages. This is not to be confused with pages that  contain similar content. These pages are grouped by categories which we will discuss later   in this chapter. Pages that exist within a namespace in a wiki are noted by the namespace  prefix that helps to form the title of the page. For example, if we have a page called  Uploading a video file that exists in the Help namespace, it would appear as Help:Uploading  a video file. Perhaps you want to create a new page for an upcoming marketing project for  your company. This would appear as Project Marketing project. MediaWiki makes use of  18 built-in namespaces. The odd numbered namespaces represent talk namespaces while even numbered ones represent subject namespaces.  Namespace   Description  Numerical  index 0   1  2  3  4   5  6   7  8  9  10  11  12  13   14   15  -2   -1   Main   Talk  User  User talk  Project   Project talk  File   File talk  MediaWiki  MediaWiki talk  Template  Template talk  Help  Help talk   Category   Category talk  Media   Special   This groups together a majority of the site's content. There is no  namespace prefix for the mainspace. The discussion pages attached to the mainspace pages. Pages that contain information about users and their history. Used to leave messages to a user. Used for information related to the operation and development  of the wiki. This is also known as the meta namespace. Used to discuss project pages. Stores metadata for files uploaded to the wiki. This includes  images, sound, video, and other files accessed through the  Media namespace. Used to discuss files and media. Contains system messages and other important content. Discussion pages related to the MediaWiki namespace. Used to hold templates used in the wiki. Discussion pages for the various templates used in the wiki. Holds help files, how-to's, and other instructions for users. Used to hold discussions related to the help files.  Holds information related to the different categories created for  the wiki.

Your new page should open up and look similar to the following screenshot:  4. Right now, the project page tab is red because the page doesn't exist yet. Click on   the edit this page link to create the page.  5. When you are satisfied with the page, click on Save page.  When the page has been saved, it will look similar to the following screenshot:  You may have noticed that while the tab reads project page, the namespace is the title  of our wiki. In this example, Floss Pro Populo appears instead of the word Project. As the project page deals with organization of the wiki, it defaults to the wiki's sitename to  represent a project taking place within the wiki itself. This can be changed; however, it is  something that should be done by more advanced MediaWiki administrators.  What just happened? Instead of simply creating a new page, we used the URL to create a new page and included  it in a specific namespace. In this example, we created a new project page explaining the  project that will include creating a user manual for a new software package. We also saw  that of the 18 namespaces, we can directly create new pages using this method in only five of them. The other 13 namespaces have their pages created by MediaWiki itself when  different actions are taken.

That's it! As we have edited this file many times, this should be  an easy task for us by now.  1. Open the LocalSettings.php file for editing. 2.  Scroll down to the last line of the file and type:  Custom namespaces $wgExtraNamespaces[100]  = "namespace"; $wgExtraNamespaces[101] =  "namespace_talk";  3.  4.  Substitute namespace for the name of your new namespace. In the example wiki, I used Tutorials and Tutorials_talk for the custom namespaces.  Save the changes to your LocalSettings.php file.  Now, you can create a new page in your newly-created namespace using the URL method in the previous exercise.  What just happened? As we wanted to organize some pages into a namespace called Tutorials, we needed to create a custom namespace. We did this by adding a few lines to the LocalSettings.php file, one to create the namespace itself, and another to create the associated talk page.  We also indentified each custom namespace with a numerical index. For custom namespaces,  MediaWiki requires us to begin with the number 100. The namespace Tutorials was given the numerical index of 100 and its associated talk namespace, Tutorials_talk, was given 101 as talk pages use odd numbers for this.  [ 160 ]               Chapter 7  Categories  While namespaces help us to organize a page by the purpose it serves in the wiki, we need to be able to organize the actual content as well. This is where categories come into play.  Categories allow us to take content pages that are related and group them together. Unlike namespaces, which can only be created by those with access to the LocalSettings.php file, categories can be created by the wiki's users.  Time for action – creating a category                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [ 161 ]               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  3. As the category page is not yet created, you have two options. First, you can click on   the create tab to create an empty category page. The second option is to click the  edit this page link. Follow along with the second option and click the edit this  page link.  Enter some content that explains the category page.  4. 5. Click on Show preview to see how your category page looks. If you are happy with   how it reads, click on Save page.  What just happened? Using the URL method to create a new page, we added a category to our wiki. Once the category page was created, you probably noticed that at the bottom there is a note telling  you that This category currently contains no pages or media. This is because while we  created a new category, we haven't added any pages or files to the category yet. In the next  exercise, you will learn how to add pages to your categories.  Adding a page to a category Some of you may remember that I said there is more than one way to create a category page. Don't worry, I haven't forgotten. We are going to learn the second way when we  learn how to add a page to a category.  Time for action – add a page to a category To add a page to a category, we only need to add a small amount of wikitext to the bottom of  the page: [[Category:Category name]]. That's all it takes. Now, if the category name is  for a category that has not yet been created, then MediaWIki will create it for you. So there you go, the second method for creating a new category! So let's add a page to our Office  Suites category in the example.  1.  Create a new page. For the example wiki, we will create a new page called  OpenOffice.org.  [ 162 ]               Chapter 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [ 163 ]               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  What just happened? As we created a category page in the previous exercise, we needed to add a page to it. To do  so, we added a bit of wikitext to the bottom of a new page to put the page into the category.  As the page we created could easily fit in other categories, we added additional Category tags to our page for the other categories. As these categories did not yet exist in our wiki, MediaWiki created them for us. Our category page for Office Suites now looks similar to the following screenshot:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       [ 164 ]               Chapter 7  Page templates  Often times, we may have content that we need to include on several pages. For instance,  we may want to include a legal disclaimer to certain pages. Or maybe we want to include a header or footer to all pages that fall into a specific category. Basically, if we have content  that we want to include on more than one page, we can use a template. Creating a template  means we don't have to type the same disclaimer, or header, or footer every time we want  to put it onto a page. Instead, we only have to create the template, and include the template tag wherever we want the content to be displayed. If this reason is not enough to make  use of templates, consider this—if we want to change some of the content in let's say, the disclaimer, we only need to change the template and all the pages will be updated. If we weren't using a template, we would have to find each page where the disclaimer content  was entered and make the necessary changes to keep it consistent. Using templates is just smart management.  Time for action – creating a template We are going to use the URL method to create a new template. When we do this, we will create an empty page where we can create the template. Once it is saved, it can be added to  any page we choose with the template tag {{templatename}}. Of course, the name we save our template as will be substituted for templatename.  For our sample wiki, we will create a template that adds a thank you to the user for sup- porting free and open source software. A link to both the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative will be included as well. This template can then be added to the  bottom of each page that describes software.  1. Open your web browser. In the address bar, type http:  www.wikiname.com    index.php Template:nameofyourtemplate. For the example wiki, we will enter http:  www.flosspropopulo.com index.php Template:Thank you. Hit Enter.  2. After you hit the Enter key, you will be taken to the new Template page. Click on edit this page to create and write the content for your template. For the sample  wiki, we use:  ---- Thank you for supporting free and open source software. You can learn more about these projects from http:  www.fsf.org and http:  www.opensource.org.  3.  Click on Show preview to see your new template. If you are satisfied, click on   Save page.  [ 165 ]               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  4. Open an existing page in your wiki. At the bottom of the page, type   {{templatename}} substituting your template for templatename.   In the example, we will be opening the OpenOffice.org page and typing  {{Thank you}} at the bottom .5. Click on Save page.  What just happened? While creating a new template, we created a footer that can be added to any page simply by  using the template tag in a page. This tag {{templatename}} is what placed the content below the horizontal rule in the previous screenshot. Anytime we include the tag for this  template, {{Thank you}}, this piece of content will appear.  Templates with parameters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [ 166 ]                     Chapter 7  Time for action – using parameters in a template While this may seem a bit difficult at first, after you complete the exercise you will see how  simple it really is. If you have programming experience, the concepts of this should be second nature to you.  In our example, we will make the parameters boldface by enclosing them with '''. However this is not necessary. What is necessary is for us to enclose the value of the parameter in triple brackets {{{ and }}}. For example:  '''parameter'''{{{value}}}  Notice that the parameter is separated from the value by two pipes   .  1. Create a new template page using the URL method. For the example wiki, we will  create a template called Tutorial by typing http:   www.flosspropopulo.com index.php Template:Tutorial.  2. Now, we need to create our template. We use the { to open the syntax   and } to close it.  3. Use some of the formatting techniques we have learned throughout the book.  For an example, we will use: { style="width:80%; " border=0" - width=30%  width=70%  -  colspan="2" align="center"'''{{{TutorialName}}}''' - '''Introduction'''{{{intro}}}  - '''Prerequisites'''{{{prereq}}}  - '''Steps'''{{{steps}}}  - '''Summary'''{{{summary}}}  }  4.  This can serve as a guide for you as well. Simply change the parameters and the  values to something that better reflects your wiki.  [ 167 ]               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  5. Make sure the syntax is correct by clicking on Show preview. If everything looks like the following screenshot, you can click on Save page. If anything is off, double check your syntax and make the necessary corrections.  Now that we have created the template let's put it to use. We will need to pass values on to our parameters on this page.  6. Open a new page for editing. 7. Open the template with double brackets {{. Using the example, we would type {{Tutorial . Make sure to end this line with a pipe. Hit Enter to drop to the next line.  8. Now we will pass values on to the parameters. Type your first   parameter followed by an equal sign  =  and the value. For example,  TutorialName = Installing MediaWiki. Hit Enter and give your next parameter a value. Continue with this until all parameters  have a value.  9. Close the page with double brackets, }}.  [ 168 ]               10.  Click on Show preview to see if everything is good. If you like what you see,  click on Save page.  Chapter 7  What just happened? Using the Template namespace, we were able to assign parameters to our template. Now, we can apply this template to any page that we want to have a consistent look. Once we declare this template on a new page, we need to pass values on to the parameters. If you don't pass a value to a parameter, it will display the wikitext for the missing parameter. For example, if we fail to include an introduction using the sample tutorial, the page will display  {{{intro}}} where the introduction would be. The pages will now have the same layout,  however the content will change. Using this technique, we created a template called Tutorial for the sample wiki and applied it to a new page. We also saw that we can apply many of the formatting techniques we have learned so far to our template to give it a more unique look  and to separate items on the page.  Have a go hero Templates are a great way to give your wiki a consistent look. Go ahead and create some  templates that you can apply to pages in your wiki. For starters, create a disclaimer or some other type of footer that you will use on certain pages and apply this template to your wiki. Once you have been able to master this, go ahead and create a template that makes use of parameters unique to your wiki.  If you are interested in learning more about parameters used with templates, search the Internet for Named and Numbered parameters. You can visit the MediaWiki page http:  meta.wikimedia.org wiki Help:TemplateParameters that specifically  addresses parameter use in a template.  [ 169 ]               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  Page redirection  If you have spent any significant time surfing the web, you must have surely come across an  instance when you follow a link but are redirected to another page. Generally, this happens for one of the two reasons, either because the content you are looking for has been moved to a different page, or because the page you are on has a similar URL to the page where  the content is housed. The latter happens frequently when someone has multiple domains  all pointing to one website. For instance, www.mysite.com hosts the website but www. mysite.org and www.mysite.net redirect to www.mysite.com so that visitors can view the content.  Both instances would be ideal scenarios where we would redirect a page in our wiki as well. Take for instance our page OpenOffice.org from the example. Perhaps someone wrote an article on Star Office years ago. When the name was changed to OpenOffice.org, we could redirect the Star Office page to the newly-created OpenOffice.org page. The second instance  from above could be used because generally, people refer to OpenOffice.org as simply Open  Office. We could then create a page called Open Office and redirect it to the OpenOffice.  org page. Both are accomplished by adding the wikitext: REDIRECT [[Article name]] to the beginning of the edit box. It is important to note that when redirecting an article that  contains content, the content does not move to the new page.  You can create a new page with the redirect tag as well.  Time for action – redirecting a page As we are hoping that many different users contribute to the example wiki, the odds of  someone coming along and creating a page named Open Office is likely. As we already have a page named OpenOffice.org, we would rather add to the existing article than create a new  one. Let's go ahead and set up a page redirect to avoid the confusion of two articles on the  same topic.  1. Create a new page. In the example, we will create one called Open Office. 2.  Enter the redirect tag and enclose the page you are redirecting to in double brackets. In the example wiki, we would use:  REDIRECT [[OpenOffice.org]]  [ 170 ]               3.  Click on Save page.  Chapter 7  You can see that after you save the page, it creates a nice little redirect message for you and  a link to the correct page. If you click on the link, Open Office, in this case, you will be taken to the OpenOffice.org page. If you enter Open Office in the search box and click Go, you will be taken to the OpenOffice.org page, but notified that this is a redirect as seen in the  following screenshot:  What just happened?

Maybe you created a page and then realized that the title is wrong.  Or, perhaps, the original article has grown and the current page name no longer seems  appropriate for the content. In MediaWiki, we would fix either of these situations by  moving the incorrect page to a correct one. Actually, the terms move and rename are  used interchangeably in MediaWiki. When you move a page, the history is moved with the content and a redirect is created from the original page to the one you moved to. This is so  that any links to the original page will remain intact, simply redirecting the visitor to the page  where you moved everything to.  Time for action – moving a page Moving a page is very easy to do. When we go to a page, we see the move tab. This is what  we will use to handle this operation.  Do you remember when we created a page called Top Software by Operating System in our example? Looking over that page, we may decide that a better title for this page would be  Top 3 Applications by Operating System. Let's go ahead and move our original page to this new one because it better describes the content.  1. Open the page that you wish to move. In this exercise, we are opening Top  Software by Operating System in the sample wiki. Make sure you are logged in.  2. Click on the move tab at the top of the wiki. 3.  In the To new title: box, enter the new page name. For our example, we will use Top 3 Applications by Operating System.  You have the option to enter a reason here as well.  4. 5. Click the Move page button.  After you have completed these steps, you will see something similar to the  following screenshot:  [ 172 ]                                                                                                                                                     Chapter 7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        [ 173 ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Organizing Your Wiki's Content  3. Delete page 1, Installing MediaWiki. 4. Move page 2, The Installation of MediaWiki, and rename it Installing MediaWiki.  This is allowed as we deleted the old version of page 1.  5. Delete page 2. 6. Move page 3, Temp, to page 2, renaming it The Installation of MediaWiki. 7. Delete page 3.  When you are done, the tutorial should now be named Installing MediaWiki and the page describing the installation process will be named The Installation of MediaWiki. Temp should be deleted completely.  What just happened? Being presented with the problem of renaming a page when a page already exists as our desired name, we used a bit of creativity to resolve our issue. Making use of the move  feature in MediaWiki, we were able to swap our pages around so that the pages were named according to our wishes. As our wiki grows, we may find that we have to swap pages on a  frequent basis as our users may inappropriately name pages or create pages using a name that a different page should actually be using.  Summary  As our site grows, we need to be proactive as the wiki administrator and make sure that  our content is well organized so that visitors can easily find what they are looking for. In this  chapter, we learned how to organize our content by creating namespaces that allow us to  group pages with similar purposes together, and we learned how to use categories to group pages with similar content together. We also looked at creating templates to add the same  content to a variety of pages, like we would do with a disclaimer. We also took the template feature to another level by adding parameters to it. When we did this, we created a layout so that similar pages can use this template to recreate the layout.  Finally, we learned about redirecting, moving, and swapping pages around so that we can  ensure, when a visitor comes to our site, they find the information they are looking for  because the page titles will match up with page's content.  As we pointed out, our wiki is growing, so it is time we focus on what we can do as the  administrator of our wiki to not only provide quality content to our visitors, but also make sure that our wiki continues to run smoothly. In our next chapter, we will look at some best practices  for a wiki administrator including security and dealing with a multi-user environment.  [ 174 ]               8  The MediaWiki Administrator  In the last chapter, we touched on some of the basic concepts of what it takes  to manage our wiki as the administrator. While we focused mainly on content  and pages, we should know that it takes much more than content management  to effectively run a site. In this chapter, we are going to start focusing on some of the administrative  functions available in MediaWiki. To really get the most out of this you will  need some knowledge about PHP for modifying files. It will be great if you have  a working knowledge about PHP for changing some of these settings. However,  if you are panicked at the thought of having to write code, don't worry; as we  go through examples, you will be able to pick up few basics of PHP. So here we  go. Don't forget, you have been working with the LocalSettings.php file  of the config folder throughout the course of this book so far and we haven't  broken anything yet!  In this chapter, we are going to focus specifically on:   The different user types  Access and permissions  Changing the allowed file types for upload  MediaWiki security  Some of what we will cover is information that will help make your job as the wiki  administrator, or sysop, much easier. While these exercises will be helpful, there are others included in this chapter that are considered essential steps to take. Most of these will be in  the section regarding securing your wiki. As you read this chapter, and take part in the exer- cises, you will be notified as to which parts are essential to the security, and functionality, of  your wiki.               The MediaWiki Administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [ 176 ]               Bot group This is a registered bot account. If edits are made by a member of this account, then they will not appear by default in the Recent changes list. This is intended for mass imports of  data without flooding human edits from view.  Chapter 8  Additional groups There are three additional groups that are known in MediaWiki. These are:  The Developer group This group was used to give members "siteadmin" rights. The group is deprecated by default,  as well as the right so the group no longer exists in MediaWiki installations.  Autoconfirmed Members of the autoconfirmed group are registered accounts at least as old as  $wgAutoConfirmAge and having at least as many edits as $wgAutoConfirmCount. This  group is used for administrators who may want to give additional privileges to users who  have been members of the wiki for a certain amount of time, or who have helped edit or  create a certain number of pages. The following screenshot represents the autoconfirmed  group privileges for the MediaWiki site:  Emailconfirmed This group may be used should the administrator decide to grant additional privileges to  members who have a confirmed e-mail address. This, along with the autoconfirmed group, is  often used to help prevent spammers and vandals from having access to certain privileges on  the wiki.  [ 177 ]               The MediaWiki Administrator  User group General user accounts or registered users are created from the registration option in the wiki  site. They can in general create new pages, read articles, and edit them.  The all users group The all users group is designated in MediaWiki by an asterisk  * . This group is implicit for  all visitors to the wiki. If the administrator chooses to make a change to this group in the wiki, they may do so by editing the code found here, which we will see in the upcoming  exercise. This may be good for a wiki where we don't want visitors to edit any content. We  can also block unregistered users or visitors from reading content as well. What's nice about MediaWiki is that it does not follow the concept of least-common privilege. This means  that if you have an account with higher-level privileges, you will not lose them if the all  users group changes its privileges. Think of this more of a way to control visitors than any  other group.  Group   Sysop   Bureaucrat   Bot   Developer   Autoconfirmed   Emailconfirmed   Permissions  By default, members of this group have all the necessary permissions to delete and restore pages, block and unblock users, and so on. By default, users in this group can change the rights of other users.  Members of this group can run automated scripts or bots.  This is an additional group not enabled by default. Members of this  group have the rights to lock and unlock the database. If this group in enabled, the sysop must set the parameters that determine promotion to this group either after a certain number of days  or a certain number of edits.  If this group in enabled, users are promoted here when they have confirmed their e-mail address. This group was discontinued as of  version 1.13.  User   *   User who has registered with the wiki.  All users, including anonymous visitors to the wiki.  [ 178 ]               Pop quiz – user groups Let's see how much you learned about the different types of user groups in MediaWiki:  1.

By default all users need to confirm their e-mail address when registering with a wiki.  Changing permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  [ 179 ]               The MediaWiki Administrator  Time for action – editing group permissions When editing group permissions, we need to be very careful that we are assigning the right  privileges to the right users. Also, if we are restricting privileges, we need to be certain that  we are editing the correct lines so we don't lock ourselves out as the administrator. While  it is a stretch, I know of quite a few people who have locked themselves out of different  systems they were in charge of.  1.  Using your FTP program or your file manager, navigate to the Default Settings.php file. The path is usually,  public_html includes  DefaultSettings.php. 2. Open the file for editing. Once it is open, locate the line that reads  $wgGroupPermissions = array  ;. This is the first line of the  code we will need to copy and can be found around line 1180.  3. Copy the lines of code from $wgGroupPermissions = array  ; to  $wgActiveUserDays = 30;. This will equal approximately 242 lines of  code, depending on which version of MediaWiki you are working with.  4. Close the DefaultSettings.php file and do not save any of the changes to this   file. You should only have copied lines of code, nothing else.  5. Open the LocalSettings.php file for editing from the root of your MediaWiki   installation, just as you have before.  Scroll to the bottom of the file and paste the code you copied over from the  DefaultSettings.php file.  Paste the copied code into the LocalSettings.php file.  Save the changes to your LocalSettings.php file, but do not close it just yet. Now, our file is ready to be edited. Let's continue on and restrict the visitor account  so they cannot edit, or create, new pages on our wiki.  6.  7. 8.  9.  In our LocalSettings.php file, locate the line that reads  $wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = true;, and the one that reads $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage'] = true;.  10. Change the word true in each line to false. 11. Save your changes.  [ 180 ]               Now, when a visitor opens a page on your wiki, they will see the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  Notice in the previous screenshot, there is no edit tab. This is because we took away the  ability of our visitors to edit any pages in our wiki. Likewise, when they search for a page that doesn't exist, they will not be presented with the option to create the page. Their ability to  create a page in any other method is restricted as well.  What just happened? By moving the selected code from the DefaultSettings.php file to the  LocalSetting.php file, we are able to edit the code so that even when we update our  MediaWiki software, our changes will remain intact. The selected code that we copied was  the array called $wgGroupPermissions. This array defines the privileges for the various  groups in our wiki. Each line, such as $wgGroupPermissions['*']['createpage'] = true; is broken down into, the array: $wgGroupPermissions, the group: ['*'], the permission: ['createpage'], and the parameter: = true;. By simply changing the parameter to false, we take away that permission.  But what about giving a group extra privileges? Don't worry, we will cover that when we learn how to create a new group.  [ 181 ]               The MediaWiki Administrator  Have a go hero You may have noticed that the DefaultSettings.php and the LocalSettings.php have quite a bit of information in them. To be a better administrator, it is important that you  understand what these files do. As a bit of a challenge, go into each of these files and copy  all of the text to a text editor or word processor. Print them out and dissect the different  lines of code to see if you can understand what is going on in these two files. Even if you are  a novice when it comes to PHP, you may be surprised at how straightforward the code is.  Creating groups There may come a time when you need to create a new group. The example we used  earlier about the need to create a special group so that assigned individuals can create departmental pages is ideal, so let's use that here.  Time for action – creating a new group Creating a new group is just as easy as it was to block users from doing certain things in our  wiki. In this example, we are going to create a group called DepartmentAuthors. We will give this group the ability to create pages and edit pages.   1. Open your LocalSettings.php file for editing. 2.  Locate the lines that grant permission to those in the Users group to create pages  and edit pages. They are:  $wgGroupPermissions['user']['edit'] = true; $wgGroupPermissions['user']['createpage'] = true;  3. Change the parameter in each line from true to false. 4. Right above the section of code that reads:      Implicit group for accounts that pass $wgAutoConfirmAge  Enter the following code:    Group for DepartmentAuthors $wgGroupPermissions['DepartmentAuthors']['edit'] = true; $wgGroupPermissions['DepartmentAuthors']['createpage'] = true;  Save your settings.  5. 6. Open your wiki and log in as the sysop. 7. Navigate to Special pages  User group rights. The URL for the sample we are   building would be http:  www.flosspropopulo.com index.php  Special:ListGroupRights.  [ 182 ]               When you open the User group rights page, you will see the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  Now, our new group, DepartmentAuthors, is an option. You can also see the permissions  that each group has. Notice that Users and all no longer have the ability to create pages or edit.  Adding users to a group We have created this new group called DepartmentAuthors but we don't have anyone in this group yet. Let's go ahead and populate this group with some of our more trusted users.  Time for action – adding users to a group Well, we have protected our wiki's content from being edited by certain people. In this example, we don't want just any employee to be able to change a manual so we created a new group and gave this group the privileges needed to create and edit content. Currently, the sysop is the only person who can create and edit the content on the site. As we are busy as the administrator, we better get some people in this group so they can start getting us  some content! We are going to start by creating a new user called Author and then move   [ 183 ]               The MediaWiki Administrator  them into the DepartmentAuthors group.  1. Open your wiki and click on the log in create account link in the upper right   corner of the screen.  2. As we are going to create a new user, click on Create an account. 3.  Fill out the Create account screen giving your user a Username of Author and then a Password and Real name.  4. Click on Create account. 5. When you create the new account, you are automatically logged in to the wiki. As  this account is a general account, we need to log out, and then log back in as our  sysop  bureaucrat .  6. When you are logged back in with your bureaucrat account, click on Special pages    User rights management. Alternately, you can access this page using the URL http:  www.flosspropopulo.com index.php Special: UserRights. Either way, you will be taken to a page where you see:  [ 184 ]            7.  Where it asks you to Enter a username, type in Author and then click Edit user   groups. The page will change to look similar to the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  8.  Place a check mark in DepartmentAuthors and click on Save user groups.

The  developers of MediaWiki were extremely restrictive in what type of files the system allows  users to upload though. While this was done to help inexperienced wiki administrators, it is something that can be rather restrictive, especially if we want to collaborate via our wiki. By  modifying our configuration, we can change the file types our users are allowed to upload.  As we trust our users, we are going to allow them to upload .pdf, .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx files to the wiki.  Time for action – editing the allowed file types for uploading The allowed file type list is available under DefaultSettings.php file. In order to change  this configuration, we have to copy the following line from DefaultSettings.php and paste it into the LocalSettings.php file. Once we have done this, we can add our file  extensions and get our users going.  1. Open the DefaultSettings.php file for editing. 2. Around line 1899, you will find the line $wgFileExtensions = array     'png', 'gif', 'jpg', 'jpeg'  ;. This defines which type  of files our wiki will accept on upload. Copy this line of code.  Type the line File extensions at the bottom of the file. This comment will let   3. Open your LocalSettings.php file for editing. 4. you know that the following line s  define the file extensions allowed. Hit the  Enter key. 5. On the next line, paste the line you copied from the DefaultSettings.php file. 6. Add the extensions, .pdf, .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx to the file so that it now   reads: $wgFileExtensions = array  'png', 'gif', 'jpg', 'jpeg', '.pdf', '.docx', '.pptx', '.xlsx'  ;.  7.  Save your changes.  What just happened? As we are such nice administrators, we decided to allow our users to upload more file  types than the default allows. We copied over the array $wgFileExtensions from  the DefaultSettings.php file to the LocalSetting.php file so we could add the  extensions. We did not make any changes to the DefaultSettings.php file because when  we have to update MediaWiki, the changes made will be overwritten. By adding this line to  the LocalSettings.php file, we can safely update later without having to worry about  our configurations.  [ 187 ]            The MediaWiki Administrator  MediaWiki security  Security in cyberspace is a large concern nowadays. Malicious hackers have seen how lucrative it is to take advantage of poorly configured websites and exploit them to stealing  credit card, personal, and confidential information. While wikis generally do not house  much financial or personal information, they can be a place where confidential information  is stored. What's worse is that the collaborative and social nature of a wiki makes it a prime  target for vandalism.  As running a wiki should be a great experience, we are going to learn some basic steps on how you can provide better security for your wiki. Unfortunately, web application security is  a highly specialized field that cannot be taught in the course of this book. What you will learn  is a good foundation for how to secure your wiki. I strongly encourage you to read more  about web application security. If this is a topic that you feel you need to learn more about,  visit http:  www.owasp.org. Not only do they have a great deal of information, tools,  and tutorials, but they have a live site that you can download and learn just how malicious hackers attack sites with step-by-step guides and hands-on exercises. Guess what, they used  MediaWiki to build their entire site!  Time for action – stopping bad behavior One of the biggest concerns for a wiki administrator is that a spam bot will start editing  pages on his or her wiki, loading them with spam.  We have seen earlier in the book that certain developers create add-ons for MediaWiki called  extensions. These extensions greatly increase what we can do with MediaWiki. One import- ant extension deals specifically with MediaWiki security—Bad Behavior. This extension helps  prevent spammers by blocking spam bots, preventing e-mail scraping, and helping prevent  against vandalism. We are going to install this extension to help secure our site.  1. Download the Bad Behavior extension from http:  www.bad-behavior.  ioerror.us download . Make sure to save the file where you can locate it. 2. Move the contents of the file bad-behavior.2.x.xx.zip to the MediaWiki   extensions folder on your server. You can do this using your FTP program   using ASCII mode , where you would have to unzip the file first, and then  move them to the folder. You can also upload the zipped file to your server  using your file manager and unzip it into the extensions folder.

When it comes to security, it is the first thing that is looked at when there is a potential  breach. As the administrator of a wiki, there will be times when you will need to view log  files, and most likely, you will be viewing the user logs.  This next extension makes it easy for the MediaWiki sysop to view these log files.  UserLoginLog adds login information to the special page called Logs. Now, you can review records for login attempts and see the IP address of the person who logged in, or attempted  to log in.  1.

What just happened? By adding the UserLoginLog extension, we enhanced the functionality of our MediaWiki's  Logs page to include login attempts. Now, we can track when people logged in to our wiki  and what IP address they used should we ever need to research an act of vandalism or a  security breach.  Have a go hero As previously stated, log files can be an administrator's best friend when it comes to  troubleshooting or security. Read up on the different log files that MediaWiki offers to you  and take some time to look through them. The more comfortable you are with the log files,  the easier your job will be when your wiki rivals Wikipedia in content!  [ 193 ]               The MediaWiki Administrator  Best practices As the administrator, you have to perform some checks on regular basis. It is better if you  make a checklist of all the required actions and go through them at least once a week  or  more frequently if required . Following are the checks that you must perform:  Stay up-to-date It is always important to stay up-to-date regarding the installed software. We are not  installing a final product. We have to remember that frequently we have a version release for  MediaWiki. Each version contains a release note. Go through the release note and see if any vulnerability has been fixed. Even if it does not contain any security update, it is always better  to update the server software. It is not just MediaWiki that needs to be updated—we have  to update PHP, MySQL, and other installed software in our web server as well. In order to get  messages from MediaWiki about updates and news, you can subscribe to the following site  for e-mail notifications: http:  mail.wikipedia.org mailman listinfo  mediawiki-announce.  PHP recommendations If you are using a shared host, then you might not have access to the PHP setup file. How- ever, if you are running a dedicated server or your local server at home or in your office, you  can set up the PHP configuration file yourself. If you do not have access to the PHP setup  file, talk to your hosting provider about what steps they have taken to secure your site. They  may have already taken these steps, or may be willing to do this for you. The filename is  php.ini. It is located under c:\windows\php.ini on Windows, and under  etc php. ini in a Linux environment. Here are some recommendations:   Disable register_globals: Many PHP security attacks are based on injection   of global variable values, and so, making sure it's off can plug many potential  vulnerabilities. MediaWiki should be safe even if this is on; turning this off is a  precaution against the possibility of unknown vulnerabilities.   Unless you require it specifically, disable allow_url_fopen: Remote PHP code   execution vulnerabilities may depend on being able to inject a URL into include   or require  . If you don't require the use of remote file loading, turning this off  can prevent attacks of this kind on vulnerable code.   Disable session.use_trans_sid: If this is on, session IDs may be added to URLs  sometimes if cookies aren't doing their thing. This can leak login session data to  third-party sites through referrer data or cutting and pasting of links. You should  always turn this off if it's on.  [ 194 ]               Chapter 8  MySQL recommendations In general, you should keep access to your MySQL database to a minimum. If it will only be  used from the single machine it's running on, consider disabling networking support. If it  will be used over a network with a limited number of client machines, consider setting the IP  firewall rules to accept access to TCP port 3306 for MySQL only from those machines or only  from your local subnet, and reject all accesses from the larger Internet. This can help prevent  accidentally opening access to your server due to some unknown flaw in MySQL,   a mistakenly set overbroad GRANT, or a leaked password.  If you create a new MySQL user for MediaWiki through MediaWiki's installer, somewhat  liberal access is granted to it to ensure that it will work from a second server as well as a local one. You might consider manually narrowing this or establishing the user account yourself with custom permissions for just the places you need.  Summary  In this chapter, we saw that there is more to running a MediaWiki site than writing good  content. As our wiki grows and we add users, we will have to decide what we will allow our users to do on the wiki. We learned that through proper management of the user groups,  we can take away privileges and provide users with extra privileges.  By default, MediaWiki is rather restrictive in what type of files it allows us to upload.  However, to be a truly collaborative site, we may need to make changes that give our users a  bit more of an option. We learned that we can control the type of files we allow our users to  upload to our wiki if we have enough trust in our user base.  Finally, we approached the subject of security. We were able to install two extensions that will help keep our wiki more secure and we learned of some best practices we need to follow  as an administrator.  In the next chapter, we are going to tackle how we can manage a multi-user environment.  With the knowledge we gained so far, this should be a breeze.  [ 195 ]                            9  Multi-user Environment  Throughout the course of this book we have emphasized how well MediaWiki  performs as a collaborative tool. In the previous chapter, The MediaWiki  Administrator, we were introduced to how we can restrict users from adding  or editing content. We have even seen specific examples of how organizations  use MediaWiki as the platform to deliver content with no option for editing  or creating. Even though these options exist, in its truest form, a wiki is a  collaborative environment. This means we may have multiple users accessing  the system and participating in building the wiki. The count might be more than  few thousands for a given moment if the site is popular. With any platform that  caters to a diverse group of people, issues are bound to arise. Contributors may  make mistakes in their articles, there may be conflicts over changes made to a  page, and many other issues can arise when dealing with people. Working in a multi-user environment definitely has its advantages, but as a  wiki administrator, it is important to keep in mind that not all users have good  intentions. As the system is open, anyone—including malicious users with bad  intentions—can partake in any activity on the site. An open system can face a  lot of user-related problems. The first major problem is that anyone can edit  or add contents. This can be dangerous if the added content is not legal or if  it is copyrighted. As the user can avoid being tracked, the site has to take the  responsibility for such acts. Another major attack can be on the content  itself—people with bad intentions can change content without any reason or  present false information. Vandalism is also a common occurrence on such  sites, and the concerns regarding false information have plagued even the most  well-respected of sites—Wikipedia. In this chapter, we will take a detailed look at these issues and learn how we  can address them.               Multi-user Environment  This chapter will be broken into three sections: User Accounts, Administration, and  Community. Under these three sections, we will look specifically at:   How the user can change their profile  How the user can change editing preferences  How the administrator can monitor content  How to block users  How to revert to an original page  Setting up and using talk pages  Resolving editing conflicts  Let's take a look at how we can manage a wiki where there will be multiple users so we can  make it a community where people are encouraged to visit.  Users  We have seen in previous chapters how to create user accounts. In the previous chapter,  we learned how we can restrict what the users can do on our wiki. While preventing guests  from creating articles and making edits takes away from the spirit of the wiki, it is sometimes  a necessity. Requiring users to be registered is known as privileged access. If the site is pro- tected by privileged access, then it is obvious that the site will be more secure than an open  system. Most of the privileged access is provided by having user accounts with different  levels of access type. A username separates one identity from those of other people. There  are many advantages of user accounts and privileges; some of them are as follows:   The system can be set such that adding, editing, and deleting content may be performed only   by registered users who are logged in to the system.   Users can set their preferences such as skins, time zones, file format, and so on.  User can be identified by a name rather than the IP address of the user's machine. So even   if a single user accesses from multiple machines, he or she will be identified by his or her  username rather than IP addresses.   Usernames are easier to remember than IP addresses.  Users can have their personal profile pages based on their user account names, and this   helps others to learn about them.  [ 198 ]               Chapter 9   User accounts give more flexibility when accessing content. Sometimes an administrator may   block an IP address in order to stop malicious users from vandalizing a site. However, if the  IP address is shared between multiple users, then it is not very wise to block it as this would  stop more than one person from accessing the site. However, if we block a user account instead, then other users from the same IP address can still access the system.   Users can create their own preferences for articles and monitor different topics, and even get   notified about certain changes to the site.  You can see from this list that not only do user accounts help make our wiki more secure and manageable, but they give the user more options as well. In the following exercises, we will  look at how the user can benefit from having a registered account.  Preferences When it comes to how an individual user sees and uses your wiki, quite a bit can be changed from the user's Preferences page. Clicking on the my preferences link users can alter their preferences in any one of the following tabs:   User profile  Skin  Math  Files  Date and time  Editing  Recent changes  Watchlist  Search  Misc  With changes in the version of the software, the preferences can change too. However, these  are the common preferences that you will find upon clicking my preferences on the top navigation panel once you are logged in.  [ 199 ]               Multi-user Environment User profile The User profile details the user's personal information. The profile can be accessed when a  user first creates an account because once they click on the Create account button, they are  taken to a page confirming their account as shown in the following screenshot:  By clicking on the link shown in the previous screenshot, the user is taken immediately to their Preferences page. However, if the user needs to make changes to their profile at a later date, they have to go through a different route.  Time for action – changing the user profile In this exercise, we are going to update our user profile to include our real name and e-mail  address so we can receive notifications when certain things are done to pages that we  are watching or have created. We are also going to learn how to change the signature for our profile so that when we use the syntax to insert our signature on a page, it will appear  differently than our username which is the default.  1.  Open your wiki and sign in as the user whose profile you need to change.  [ 200 ]               2.  When you are at the Main page, click on the my preferences tab at the top   of the screen:  Chapter 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [ 201 ]            Multi-user Environment  6. Make any changes to the E-mail section. For the example, we added a check to   E-mail me when a page on my watchlist is changed.  7. When your changes have been made, click on Save. If you provided an e-mail address, you will be notified that the confirmation will be sent to this address. The following screenshot shows the changes we made:  [ 202 ]                                        Chapter 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          [ 203 ]               Multi-user Environment  Time for action – changing the skin Changing the skin is extremely easy to do. Before you go ahead and make a change, preview each of the skins to see which one you prefer. When you click on the Preview link, a new window will open displaying your Main page using the selected skin. Don't worry, no changes have been made yet! Once you find a skin you like, follow these steps to make the  change permanent:  If you have not done so, open your wiki and log in.  1. 2. Navigate to the skins page by clicking the my preferences link and then the Skins tab. 3.  Select the radio button for the skin you would like to use. For the example, we  will be using Cologne Blue.  4. Click on Save.  If you are following along, you should see your Preferences page with the new skin applied as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 204 ]               Chapter 9  What just happened? With a quick click of the mouse, we were able to change the way our wiki looks. To clarify  things, this is the way the wiki will appear to the individual user. Changing the skin will not change how the wiki appears to other visitors.  We will see in Chapter 10, Advanced Customization, how we can find new skins for our wiki  and even how to go in and change the HTML and CSS for existing skins to make them fit our  own design styles.  To prevent users from changing their skins, you can remove the Skin tab from the Preferences page by setting the $wgAllowUserSkin option in LocalSettings.php to false.  Editing preferences The Editing tab allows the user to change the different options available when editing  content on a page. While most of the changes made only require you to use a check box, you also have the option of setting the number of Rows and Columns in the edit box by changing the default numbers. It is important to note that certain features; Enable section editing by  right clicking on section titles, Edit pages on double click, and Show edit toolbar all require JavaScript to be enabled in order for them to work.  Time for action – changing the editing preferences So far, making changes to the preferences has been relatively easy. Changing the editing  preferences is simple as well. In this exercise, we are going to set the editing preferences  so that we see a preview on the first edit and we are prompted every time we leave the  summary section blank.  If you haven't done so, open your wiki and log in.  1. 2. Click on the my preferences link. When you are on the Preferences page, select   the Editing tab.  3.  4.  In the Editing section, locate the line that reads: Show preview on first edit  and place a check next to it.  Locate the line that reads: Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary  and place a check next to it.   5. Click on Save.  [ 205 ]               Multi-user Environment  Before you click on Save, your screen should look similar to the following screenshot:  Once you click on the Save button, you will be taken back to the main Preferences screen and a box will inform you that Your preferences have been saved.  What just happened? When adjusting the preferences for the user, we changed the default editing settings.  Now, whenever we edit a page for the first time, we will automatically see a preview of the  changes. Also, whenever we leave the editing summary blank, we will be notified as shown  in the following screenshot:  [ 206 ]               Have a go hero We have seen how easy it is to change the prefrences of a user. As we have only looked at three of the available tabs, take some time to look through the remaining sections. While  you are exploring these, make whatever changes you feel are necessary for your account. Remember, if you change things and need to revert to the default settings, you can always  click on the Restore all default settings button.  Chapter 9  Administration Users have it easy in the multi-user environment. All they have to do is change the  preferences on their account to differentiate themselves from the rest of the group. As a  sysop, the management of a multi-user wiki is not so simple.  To make sure your wiki runs smoothly and provides up-to-date, accurate content to your  visitors, you have to be on top of things. One of the most difficult tasks is the monitoring of  content. As stated before, it is unfortunate that a public wiki is always at risk for vandalism and inaccurate content. Even corporate wikis that only allow certain individuals to create and edit content requires diligence on the part of the sysop. While vandalism is less of a concern, working with multiple authors can present many challenges, especially when it comes to  editing pages.  All the exercises we perform in this section of the chapter will all help the sysop maintain the  integrity of their wiki's content.  Page history There will be times when you need to view all of the edits that have taken place on a  particular page. Perhaps you have a corporate wiki and someone made a change to a policy  that effects an upcoming lawsuit against your company. Your boss may be interested when  this took place. Perhaps you have a public wiki and someone came in vandalized a few pages. The page history can help you locate the culprit and block them from access  this is coming  up later in this section .  Each page, except Special pages, contains a history of all the changes made to that page. This is  known as the page history, though it is also called edit history. It consists of the old versions of the wiki text, as well as a record of the date and time of each edit, the user name or IP address  of the user who edited it, and the edit summary they included. This history tool can be used to  track changes very easily and is accessed by clicking the history tab at the top of the page. Page history is the most suitable option for tracking changes related to the page. We can also revert  changes from the history which we will learn later in the Community section of this chapter.  Having a solid understanding of the way the page history functions will help the sysop in many  different ways.  [ 207 ]               Multi-user Environment  Time for action – viewing the page history When viewing the page history, you will see that edits are listed from newest to oldest. Also, each edit will take up one line to show the time and date of the edit, the contributor's  name  or IP address if they are a guest , the edit summary, and other information helpful to  the sysop. In this exercise, we are going to see how we can view this information, but more  importantly, how we can use this information.  1. Open your wiki and log in. Open up a document that you have made some changes to. 2. Click on the history tab at the top of the page. You will be taken to a page that looks  similar the following screenshot. Notice that we have separated this page into three   different sections: one area where you can search the page history by year and  month, one area where you can determine how many results are displayed,  and the list of page edits.                                                                                                                             [ 208 ]               Chapter 9  3.  Looking at the page history section, you will see the words  cur  and  prev . These  are used to take you to a new page called diff page, as seen in the following screenshot. A diff page is a page where the difference between the two versions is shown. The first item on the line,  cur , shows you the current revision that appears below the changes, so you can see how the page is now rendered. On the other hand,  prev  takes you to a diff page showing the changes between that edit and  the previous version. The later version  the one on the same line as the last you clicked on  appears below the changes; so you can see how the page was rendered. The two columns of radio buttons can be used to select and compare any two  versions of the page. As we proceed through this exercise, we will compare the version from 21:39, 14 September 2009 to the one from 01:21, 23 August 2009.  4. Click the left-column radio button next to the line for 01:21, 23 August 2009. The right column is then populated with buttons till the row before this line.  5. Click the right-column button next to the line that reads 21:39, 14 September 2009. 6. Now, click Compare selected versions. This takes you to a diff page showing the   changes between the two versions. The more recent version  in this case, line  21:39, 14 September 2009  appears below the changes, so you can see how the page was rendered as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 209 ]               Multi-user Environment  What just happened? By clicking on the history tab for a page, we are able to see a history of all edits made to that page. We are able to see the date and time each edit took place, and also the user who  made the change. If we know that a specific user vandalized pages on our site, we can look  through the page history of other pages as well to see if he or she made any edits to them.  We also saw that we can compare the changes between versions of a page as well. By selecting the version we want and clicking on the Compare selected revisions button, we are  presented with a side-by-side comparison of how the pages are different.  Having this available to us can make our job as the sysop of a multi-user wiki much easier  because we can see exactly which users have contributed to a page and when. Of course, how this information is put to use can serve endless possibilities.  Recent changes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ 210 ]               Recent changes page looks as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  The previous screenshot shows recent changes occurred over two days. Let's look at what  what each entry means, from left to right:   The first thing on the list is a diff link. This links to the diff page for this edit; it is not available   for new pages or for page moves. The entry under 14 September 2009 for GIMP is a new page, however the diff is not a link.   The hist link corresponds to the page history on the edited page; it shows not just this edit but also older and newer ones. For page moves, the hist link leads to the history of the new page title.   A bold m indicates that the user marked the edit minor. Only logged-in users can mark an   edit as minor to avoid abuse. An example of a minor edit is seen in the entry for Top 3  Applications by Operating Systems on September 14.   A bold N indicates that the page is new. It is possible for a change to possess both the minor  and new indicators; this is typically used for new redirects. In the example, the page for GIMP created on September 14 is a new page.   A bold ! indicates that the page is unpatrolled. We will focus on patrolled and unpatrolled  edits at the end of this chapter.  [ 211 ]                                                                                   Multi-user Environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              [ 212 ]               3.  Vandalized pages are signified by a:  Chapter 9  4.  You can change your timezone from the Recent changes page.  5.  The maximum number of changes you can show at one time is:  a. V b. X c. ! d. nothing  a.  True b.  False  a. 25 b. 100 c. 250 d. 500  Watching pages Even the smallest of wikis can easily grow to hundreds of pages. This being said, it is easy  to see how it can become nearly impossible to find all the changes made to your edits, or  to pages that you created. MediaWiki has a wonderful feature to address this problem. It is called watching a page. You can watch any page you want, even if you didn't create it or edit it in any way.  If you watch a page, that page will be added to your watchlist. When the page has been changed, edited, or added to, you will get an automatic notification from the system based  on your preference setting  remember when we added our e-mail address . Also, on your  watchlist page, all the pages that have been modified since your last visit will be shown in  bold so you can easily identify the changes.  [ 213 ]               Multi-user Environment  Time for action – watch a page and revert In this exercise, we are going to watch a page that is very important to us. As the admin- istrator, there will most likely be certain pages you need to keep an eye on. Users too may  want to watch certain pages for changes, such as a page that addresses workplace policies  in a corporate wiki, or perhaps you follow a wiki like Joomla!'s documentation site.  Wouldn't it be nice to know when the documentation has been updated to match their  latest version?  1. Open your wiki and log in. 2. Navigate to the page you wish to watch. 3. Click on the watch tab at the top of the page. You will now be told that the page   you selected has been added to your watchlist as seen in the following screenshot:  When you visit the page again, there will be an unwatch tab instead of watch. If you wish to stop watching the page, click this tab and you will no longer be watching the page.  [ 214 ]               Chapter 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [ 215 ]               Multi-user Environment  Time for action – reverting to previous content In our example, it appears that someone has not only changed the text for one of our pages, but someone has vandalized it as well. While one edit may be a legitimate change, as the  sysop we don't want this page edited by the public, so we are going to revert to the previous page. In the case of vandalism, we have no other choice than to go back to the clean version of the page. The following screenshot shows the two changes made to the page. Following  the screenshot, we will learn how to revert to the original page.  1.  Open your wiki and navigate to the page you wish to make changes to.  [ 216 ]               2.  Click on the history tab at the top of the page and you will be taken to the page  history. Locate the time and date of the revision you wish to revert to.  Chapter 9  3. Click on the time and date link. In our example, we   selected 21:39, 14 September 2009.  4. We will now be taken to the page that existed on that date, and at that time. 5. Click on the edit tab at the top of the page. You will now be taken to   the editing page. As we are reverting, we don't need to make any  changes. It is good practice to put something in the edit summary  referring to the fact that you reverted to an earlier page.  6. Click on Save page. A newline will be added to the page history reflecting   the changes you just made as shown in the following screenshot:  In the case of vandalism, it may be wise to check the contribution history of the user who  vandalized the article by clicking on their IP address or user name. Clicking on their IP will  often bring you directly to their user contribution page. If you are able to click on their user  name, that will bring you to their user page. In the lower-left corner, there is a toolbox with  a User contributions link. Click on this link. If this user is vandalizing many articles, you may  need to take action.  [ 217 ]               Multi-user Environment  What just happened? When we noticed that our page had been edited and we did not approve of the changes, we  used the page history to revert to an earlier version of the content that met our approval.  In our example, we were able to revert from a legitimate change as well as an attack by a  vandal. We also learned that when a vandal strikes our wiki, we may want to check their User contributions page to see what other articles they may have wreaked havoc on.  More administrative tools MediaWiki has quite a few more tools that the administrator can use to help monitor a multi-user wiki. While some of these have been mentioned already in the text, such as edit  summaries and minor changes, they need further explanation.  Edit summaries We had a brief discussion about edit summaries in the last exercise when we were reverting  to an earlier revision of a page. It is highly recommended that anyone editing a page fills  in the Summary field because it makes it easier for you and your fellow contributors to  understand what has been changed. It is also extremely helpful when going through the history of the page.  The edit summary box can hold one line of 200 characters. If you attempt to enter more than  this, only the first 200 characters will be displayed and the rest will be disregarded. In the  case of a small addition to an article, it is highly recommended the full text of this addition  be copied to the Summary field, giving a maximum of information with a minimum of effort.  This way, readers of the summary will be unlikely to check the page itself as they already  know the extent of the edit. These kinds of summaries allow users to check Recent changes, page history, and User contributions very efficiently.  In addition to a summary of the change itself, the Summary field may also contain an  explanation of the change. Note that if the reason for an edit is not clear, it is more likely to be reverted, especially in the case that some text is deleted. To give a longer explanation, use  the talk page and make a note about it in the edit summary.  After saving the page, the summary cannot be edited, so try to avoid any errors.  [ 218 ]               Chapter 9  Minor changes If you look at the previous screenshot, you will see a check box labeled This is a minor edit. Minor edits have been glossed over in this chapter but now, we will give them a bit  more attention.  When editing a page, logged-in users may mark a change to a page as a minor edit. Minor  edits deal with changes such as correcting a type, changing the format of the content, or  changing the presentation of the content. Minor edits usually do not involve changing the  actual content of the page.  By contrast, a major edit makes the article worth reviewing for anyone who watches it  closely. Therefore, any change that affects the meaning of an article is not minor, even if it  involves one word.  The distinction between major and minor edits is significant because you may decide  to ignore minor edits when viewing recent changes. Logged-in users can even set their preferences to not display such edits. No one wants to be fooled into ignoring a significant  change to an article simply because it was marked minor, of course. So remember to  consider the opinions of other editors when choosing this option.  Users who are not logged into the wiki are not able to mark changes as minor because of the potential for vandalism. The ability to mark changes as minor is another way you can entice  your visitors to register.  It is always better to mark the edit as minor if you are doing the following changes:   Spelling corrections  Simple formatting  capitalization, bold, italics, and so on   Formatting that does not change the meaning of the page  for example, adding horizontal   lines or splitting a paragraph into two where such splitting isn't contentious    Obvious factual errors  changing 1873 to 1973, where the event in question clearly took   place in 1973    Fixing layout errors  We have to remember the following things when we are marking an edit as minor edit:   Any change to the wikitext, even if it does not affect the presentation of the page in HTML   for example, adding a space or a line break , will still be treated as a change according to  the database.   Marking a major change as a minor one is considered bad manners, especially if the change  involves the deletion of some text.  [ 219 ]               Multi-user Environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       [ 220 ]                                                                                                                                    Pop quiz – edits So, are you ready to test what you have learned about edits in MediaWiki?

Your wiki's community  As stated many times throughout the book, a wiki is used best when it is a tool that the  community can use. In order for the community to collaborate and use the wiki effectively,  we need to make sure that as the sysop, we do our job and allow communication between  the users. In this section, we will look at a few tools that MediaWiki has in place to help  facilitate communication among the wiki' s users. We will also see how extensions can help  make our job as sysops easier, while making the end user's experience richer as well.  [ 221 ]               Multi-user Environment  Talk pages The first method of communication among the wiki users should be the talk pages. There  are two types of talk pages: standard talk pages are used to discuss an article, and user talk  pages are used to communicate with other users or leave them messages. Every page has an associated talk page, except pages in the Special namespace. If there is no discussion for a page, the link to its talk page will be red. You can still use this feature, you will just be the  first person to do so.  Time for action – starting a conversation on a standard talk page Let's suppose you come across an article that you would like to see more information on. In  the sample that we have created, let's say that a registered visitor wants to see a bit more information for the page titled, Best software. The visitor can use the talk page to introduce  his or her ideas about the page. Let's see how this can be done.  Log in to your wiki and select an article to begin discussing. For our example, we  are using the Best software page.  2. Click on the discussion tab at the top of the page.  1.  3.  The talk page will now open. Type whatever you wish to communicate. In the  example, we wrote: I would like to see a description of each software package so I  know what they can do. Does anyone know them well enough to do  this? ~~~~   The four tildes  ~  at the end will leave our signature.  [ 222 ]               4.  Click on Save page. Your page will now look similar to the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  Now the editor of the page, if they are paying attention, can respond to FLOSSuser's request  for more information. By opening the discussion page and clicking on the edit tab, they can respond. As they would be responding to FLOSSuser's question, they should lead off their  discussion with a colon  :  to indent the text like this:  :I like that idea. I will be updating this page shortly so that you  and the other visitors will know what each software package is used  for. Are there any other requests? ~~~~  Now, FLOSSuser can also make use of the colon  :  when responding, only they would use two colons to indent even further:  ::Yes, if you have a screenshot for each one I would appreciate that  as well! Thanks. ~~~~  The following screenshot shows that the discussion is nicely organized:  [ 223 ]               Multi-user Environment  Time for action – starting a conversation on a user talk page Just as we are able to converse with others through standard talk pages, we can leave messages for others through their user talk page as well. The wikitext formatting is the same;  the only real difference comes in how we find a user's page. In this example, FLOSSuser will  be leaving a message on Jeff's user talk page.  1. 2.  3.  Log in to the wiki.   To access a user's talk page, you need to click on their name in their signature  this will be in red, not the standard blue . Open an article that contains their  signature and click on the link.  If no discussion has been started, you will be brought to the page as shown  in the following screenshot:  This is similar to the newly-created standard talk page in the previous exercise.  4. 5. Add your comments to the user. For our example, we will write:   Thank you for making the changes to the Best Software page. I am a  regular contributor to Ubuntu. Do you mind if I create some GNU  Linux and Ubuntu pages? ~~~~  [ 224 ]            6.  Click on Save page.  Chapter 9  Of course, Jeff can then respond on FLOSSuser's page.  What just happened?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [ 225 ]            Multi-user Environment  Time for action – resolving an edit conflict When an edit conflict takes place, the edit conflict page is shown with the conflict page  source. The first text area shows your wikitext or source. Below that, the differences  between the two edits are shown according to the differences or diff option. In the  Differences, the text you modified is highlighted in yellow while the stored text is highlighted  in green. After that, the other edit option is shown in an area called Your text. If you save your changes using the Save button, then the other changes will be gone. So before saving  any of the changes, we have to merge both the sources  yes, we have to merge as the process is not automatic .  [ 226 ]            Chapter 9  1.  Look at the diff area to see who made the more complicated changes. In this  instance, the user Jeff made some minor changes while FLOSSuser made some  significant changes.  The user receiving the edit conflict should then merge the two articles together. In   2. this instance, we will copy the text that FLOSSuser created  in the Your text area  and  paste it into the edit area. 3. Once the content has been moved, FLOSSuser should then make the corrections to   the article that Jeff made  shown in the diff area .  4. Click on Save page. The changes will now be reflected on the new page as shown   in the following screenshot:  [ 227 ]            Multi-user Environment  What just happened? Inevitably, two or more people will make changes to a page at the same time. When this  happens, the users who save after the first edits have been saved will receive an edit conflict  warning. Edit conflicts can be time consuming because the user will have to merge the two  edits together using copy and paste. Often times, they should respect the other users edits  and go back to include them as well.  In this exercise, we saw what happens when an edit conflict occurs and how to merge the  two edits together. This is another reason why the talk pages can be so helpful. If Jeff knew  that FLOSSuser was making major changes to the content, he may not have been so anxious to make the minor changes he was responsible for. Of course, in the case where users do not respect one another's edits in resolving a conflict, the sysop may have to revert the page to  the state it was in prior to the edits and include what he or she deems appropriate edits.  Discussion extension There are many extensions that MediaWiki has that can help make the community stronger.  Many of these will be discussed in Appendix A, The Best Extensions. For now, we are going to concentrate on one extension in particular called Discussion.  Time for action – installing the Discussion extension We saw how the talk pages are a good way to let the community discuss the content on  a page, but talk pages are generally geared towards potential edits, correcting the article,  or future additions to the page. Let's say you want to allow users to comment on a page  or its content. User feedback can be a useful tool in creating good content or for inspiring  interesting debates. As a sysop, we probably wouldn't want the reader feedback to be inter- twined with the talk page though. Instead, we can install an extension called Discussion to  provide a space for user to discuss and debate page content.  1. Download the extension from http:  en.wikicaptions.org wiki    Extensions:Discussion:Installation.  2. Upload the compressed Discussion file to the extensions folder   on your server using your file manager or FTP program.  Extract the Discussion file into the extensions folder.  3. 4. On your server, open your LocalSetttings.php file and find the value for  $wgDBprefix. Write down the value. In the example wiki, this is flossWiki.  5. Copy the following SQL statement from the URL above   to your favorite text editor for editing: CREATE TABLE flossWikidiscussion   [ 228 ]            Chapter 9  discussion_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY discussion_id ,  page_id INT NOT NULL,  id TINYTEXT NOT NULL,  view_group VARCHAR 16 ,  post_group VARCHAR 16 ,  restricted_post_group VARCHAR 16 , moderator_group VARCHAR 16 ,  max_depth INT,  counted_depth INT,  page_size TINYTEXT,  show_all_page_size INT,  expanded_depth INT,  show_all_order INT,  init_display TINYTEXT,  time_format INT,  characters_max INT,  author_characters_max INT,  quoting INT,  preview INT,  comment_num1 INT DEFAULT 0,  comment_num2 INT DEFAULT 0  comment_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY comment_id ,  discussion_id INT NOT NULL,  user_id INT,  author_name TINYTEXT,  text TEXT,  time INT,  status INT,  author_status INT,  parent_id INT,  depth INT,  vote INT   ;   ;  CREATE TABLE flossWikidiscussion_comments   CREATE INDEX IDX_discussion_page_id ON    flossWikidiscussion  page_id ;  CREATE INDEX IDX_discussion_page_url ON flossWikidiscussion     page_url ;  CREATE INDEX IDX_discussion_comments_discussion_id ON   flossWikidiscussion_comments  discussion_id ;  [ 229 ]            Multi-user Environment  6. Change the flossWiki to your value for $wgDBprefix. For example,   your SQL statement will read yourvaluediscussion and your- valuediscussion_comments. 7. Copy the edited SQL statement. 8. Open up your database management tool. We have been using phpMyAdmin. 9.  In phpMyAdmin, select the database for your wiki from the upper-left corner of the  screen. Once you have selected your wiki's database, a new screen will open as  shown in the following screenshot:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              [ 230 ]            Chapter 9  14.  Save your edits. 15.  Now open your wiki and log in. 16.  Open a page and click on the edit tab. 17.  Insert the   tab at the bottom of every page you wish to display   comments on.  18.  When you save the page, you will have the ability to post comments.  [ 231 ]            Multi-user Environment  What just happened? Well, we had to do quite a bit of work, but after we downloaded the extension, created  some new tables in our database, and edited our LocalSettings.php file, we were able  to install a really cool extension called Discussion. As a result, our users can now use the talk pages to discuss edits related to the page, and use the Discussion extension to leave comments or engage in a debate about the content on the page.                                                                                                                                                              [ 232 ]                                          Have a go hero After successfully installing Discussion, we should feel pretty confident in our abilities to  install new extensions on our wiki. There are other extensions out there that can help  make your wiki more friendly towards a multi-user environment as well. Now that you have  accomplished the exercises in this chapter, go ahead and find some more on your own to  install. If you need help, refer to Appendix A, The Best Extensions.  Chapter 9  Summary  We accomplished quite a bit in this chapter. The first part dealt with the users and how  they can modify their profiles and change their editing preferences. By clicking on the my  preferences tab, users are able to change the wiki's appearance by applying different skins or  add pages to a watchlist so that any edits can be monitored.  In the second part of this chapter, we were introduced to how the administrators, or sysops, can view a page's history to view previous edits made to the page. If we see an edit that we don't agree with, we learned how we can revert the page to an earlier date to erase these edits. This works especially well should the wiki be a target of vandalism. Finally, we were  taken through exercises that helped us build a stronger community for our users. By making use of talk pages, we saw how users are able to communicate directly with one another, or discuss edits and changes related to the page's content. To close out the chapter, we were  taken through an exercise where we installed a MediaWiki extension called Discussion. Discussion allows users and visitors to post comments about the content on the page to promote even more interaction among the wiki's visitors.  In our next chapter,  we are going to cover advanced customization of our wiki and get into  some hacks that can help enhance the functionality of our site. So, what are you waiting for?  Turn the page and let's get started!  [ 233 ]                      10  Advanced Customization  Throughout the book, we have seen little ways of turning the default  MediaWiki installation into our wiki. We have changed the logo to better  reflect our wiki, we have added extensions to increase our wiki's functionality,  and we have modified what users can—and cannot—do when visiting our  wiki. As we progressed, we have also spent quite a bit of time editing the PHP  files in the backend of our wiki and even modifying the database files. If we  have participated in the exercises so far, and have taken on some of the hero  challenges, then we are more than ready to learn some ways so that we can  really customize our wiki.  In this chapter, we will be dealing with the backend of our wiki quite a bit. The backend  consists of the PHP and database files that power our wiki. The changes we will make would  be to further customize our wiki so that it not only reflects the look we want, but also to  function the way we want. Specifically, we will learn:   How to change the skin for the entire wiki  Where to find important skin files  How to modify the CSS of our wiki  How to change the wiki's footer  How to modify the navigation box  How to move sections around in our wiki  Ways to modify users capabilities  How to hack our wiki            Advanced Customization  Once we are done with this chapter, we should have our wiki looking and working the way we want. Of course, we can always go back and make any alterations we choose!  Unfortunately, if you are reading this in black and white you will have to take my word for the color changes made in this chapter, but I assure you, they are there!  Customizing your wiki's appearance  When we talk about customizing your wiki, most people will think about the way the wiki looks. Changing the appearance is also one of the easiest customizations we can make.  After all, it was early on in the book that we learned to change the logo from the MediaWiki  sunflower to one of our choice. However, by the end of this chapter, you will have learned  many other useful ways to make your wiki truly your own.  In this section, we will be dealing with Cascading Style Sheets  CSS . Some prior knowledge of this is required to complete the exercises in the text. If you need to learn more about CSS, check out the tutorials at www.w3schools.com css  or http:  htmldog.com. You can also search the web for other useful information about CSS.  When it comes to the wiki's appearance, we need to know two things. First, we need to know what it is we can customize. Second, we need to know what are the files that we can  customize. To answer the first question, we can change the background color and image, the  font color, font type, graphics, buttons, logo, and so on. Basically, anything found in the skin  that can be changed. This brings us to our second question. What files allow us to change the  appearance? Let's look into that right now.  Time for action – changing the skin In Chapter 9, Multi-User Environment, we learned that a user can change the way the wiki looks when he or she is logged in, by changing the skin. That's all well and good for the  individual, but what if we, the sysop, wish to change the skin across the entire wiki for all  users? Can we do that? The answer is yes. We can change the skin. And, as we will see, we  can later edit the skin as well.  If you want to change the default skin for the site, then you have to modify the LocalSettings.php file to reflect this. The newly-changed skin for the site will then be  loaded as the default skin for all the site visitors unless they have set a different skin in their  preferences. In this case, once users log in, they will see their chosen skin if it is different  from the default one. In this exercise, we will be changing the default skin from Monobook  to Cologne Blue.  [ 236 ]            Chapter 10  1. Open the file manager for your wiki. Remember, we use Cpanel for the examples but  you can use an FTP program such as FileZilla as well.  2. Open your LocalSettings.php file for editing. 3.  Find the line that reads: $wgDefaultSkin = 'monobook';. This can be found  around line 108.  4. Change the word monobook to the skin you like. For the example, we will be using  Cologne Blue so our editing line will look like this:  $wgDefaultSkin = 'cologneblue';  It is important that you use lowercase and no spaces between words. This is why  Cologne Blue was entered as cologneblue.  5.  Save your changes.  If we bring up our wiki, and are not logged in, we will see that the appearance of the wiki has changed to reflect our new skin as shown in the following screenshot. If you are still logged  in to your wiki from a previous session, you will not notice these changes!  [ 237 ]            Advanced Customization  What just happened? By modifying the $wgDefaultSkin line of the LocalSettings.php file we were able  to change the default skin for visitors who are not logged in. This can be quite useful if we  want to maintain a consistent look for our wiki. But what happens when our visitors log in and change their skin through my preferences? While they can't change the skin for anyone but themselves, it still defeats the purpose of us taking the time to create a consistent look  and style to our wiki. If keeping the wiki's skin consistent is important, you will learn how to disable the user's ability to change their skin later on in this chapter.  Making changes to the skin MediaWiki gives us eight different skins to choose from, but this doesn't quite work for every  wiki. After all, for FlossProPopulo, I like the green we used. All the skins provided by the  MediaWiki developers use blue. While I think the Cologne Blue skin is nice, I would really like it if it had some green in it.  This is where our knowledge of CSS will be put to use. By going into the skin files, we will be  able to change the color scheme to anything we want. Would you prefer the skin be Cologne Pink? Jump right in and change all the instances of blue to shade of pink. Now, we will change the color not only of the skin, but also of the text and background as well.  Before we go any further, we need to learn where these skin files really are. A skin is a  PHP class that contains all the necessary functions to generate HTML output for each wiki  page that will be shown in our browser. What really happens is that each available skin  in MediaWiki is a different class that inherits the Skin class and implements each of the necessary functions to draw the page. In the MediaWiki installation directory, we have a  folder named skins. If you browse the folder, you will see a few PHP files, which are the skin  files, and a few folders with the same names as the PHP files. These folders contain CSS files  for each skin.  The core skin class and other associated classes are inside the includes folder of the MediaWiki installation directory. The names of those classes are:   Skin.php  SkinTemplate.php  The SkinTemplate class inherits the Skin class. These are the files responsible for what  we see on screen. These classes return different bits of HTML code. However, what is it that  holds things together? Which class actually decides the layout of the page on screen? Well, none of these classes are used for that! Earlier, we talked about the skins folder. All the skin definitions reside in this folder. The example we have shown in the first image of this  chapter used the Cologne Blue skin. So if you open the CologneBlue.php file, you will see  many division tags     have been used to hold the pieces together to show the page's structure. The content returned from skin classes is shown properly using the HTML   [ 238 ]            Chapter 10  structure in the appropriate skin file. You must remember that if you want to change the  layout, then you have to change the specific skin file in the skins folder, not the Skin.php file in the includes folder.  Time for action – locating and analyzing the CologneBlue.php file As we want to change the color of the skin to incorporate green, we need to make some changes. In this exercise, we will change the color of what is called the topbar. As the example in this chapter makes use of the Cologne Blue skin, this is the one we will be  using. Remember, you can apply this to any of the skins available to you.   1. Open your file manager or FTP program so that you can access MediaWiki's files. 2. Navigate to  public_html skins . You should see a list of folders and files as   shown in the following screenshot:  [ 239 ]            Advanced Customization  3. As there is no folder for Cologne Blue, open the folder named common. 4. Open the file cologneblue.css for editing. You can edit the CSS directly in   the file manager, or you can download the file and edit it in a CSS editor such as  Dreamweaver.  5.  Locate the line that reads: td.top {  background-color: 6688AA; color: white; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 8pt; }  td.top a {  font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: 6688AA; color: white; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10pt;  and change 6688AA to 04B404 to make the topbar a nice shade of green.  Save your changes.  6. 7. Open your wiki. You should now see that the topbar, which was once blue, is green  as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? While MediaWiki provides quite a few skins for us to choose from, we will probably want  to make changes to the look of our wiki that go deeper than selecting a different skin. To  make these changes, we learned that we must go into the CSS file of our skin and modify it.  In this instance, we did away with the default blue in the Cologne Blue skin and turned the topbar green to better reflect our wiki. Of course, if green is not your favorite color, you can  use any hexadecimal color code you wish. If you haven't memorized the chart of hex color codes, then an online reference can be found at http:  html-color-codes.info. This  is a great reference because you can enter a hex code in to see if it matches a color you are looking for. Also, you can select a color and the site will provide the hex code for you.  [ 240 ]            Chapter 10  Editing CSS One common thing that web designers like to do is change the background of a web page. Basically, white is considered to be the best choice, but sometimes, a bit more excitement is  called for. However, when you change the background color, you often need to change to the  text color as well so that they don't clash and we stick to good design principles.  In the following exercises, we will change to the MonoBook skin so you can see what some of the other skin's CSS files look like. In order to see the changes, we need to change the  value of $wgDefaultSkin in the LocalSettings.php back to monobook.  Time for action – changing the skin's background                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [ 241 ]            Advanced Customization  5. Notice that the background is set to f9f9f9 which is a very light gray. There is also   a reference to headbg.jpg. This image file also appears in the background of the  MonoBook skin.  6. Change the hex code f9f9f9 to 8CD794. Then, delete url headbg.jpg  0 0   no-repeat. Make sure you do not delete the semicolon  ; .  7.  Save your changes. Now if you open your wiki, you will notice that the background color has changed  and the wavy image is gone as shown in the following screenshot:  Now that is a bit better, but what if we need to have some sort of image in the  background? Let's keep editing this file so we can insert an image as well. Also, I  don't like the white boxes that surround the toolbox, search box, and so on. Let's take this a step further and make those boxes transparent so everything shows up with our background color.  [ 242 ]            8. Reopen the monobook folder found at \public_html\skins\monobook\. 9. Upload your background image to this folder. For our example, we will be using a file   called bg-gnu.png. After all, what better image symbolizes FLOSS than a GNU?  Chapter 10  10. Open the main.css file for editing. 11. Go back to the body section:  body {  font: x-small sans-serif; background: 8CD794; col- or: black;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  In the background line, add url yourfile  0 0 no repeat. In the example, we will type url bg-gnu.png  0 0 no repeat so your body section will look like  the following:  font: x-small sans-serif;  background: 8CD794 url bg-gnu.png  0 0 no-repeat ; color: black;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  12.  Now, let's make those white boxes transparent by locating the code reading:  body {  }  .pBody {  font-size: 95%; back- ground-color: white; color: black; border- collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid aaa; padding: 0 .8em .3em .5em;  Change the line that reads background-color: white; to background-color: transparent;  13.  Make the same change to the background-color lines in the content section   and the footer section.  14.  Save your changes.  [ 243 ]               Advanced Customization  If you followed the exercise exactly, your site should look similar to the following screenshot:  Of course, the image of your choice will be shown rather than the GNU, but you get the idea.

[ 244 ]            Chapter 10  Time for action – changing the color of the text As we have changed our background color to green, we may have noticed that the default  blue text in the navigation box and toolbox don't look so good. That's quite alright because  we are going to change that right now.  1. Navigate to \public_html\skins\monobook\.  Again, if you are having problems  check with your hosting provider for the correct path.   2. Open the main.css file for editing. 3.

This is what we  will be changing.  4. Change 002bb8 to 000000 to change the blue text to black. 5. Change 5a3696 to E8F715 to change the violet text color to a yellow hue when a  6.

[ 245 ]               Advanced Customization  Now, when you visit your wiki, the colors of your text will be different as shown in the  following screenshot:  What just happened? Again, we edited the main.css file to make stylistic changes to the MonoBook skin, giving  our wiki a more personal look. This time, we altered the color of the text that appears in our  wiki's navigation box and toolbox. We also made changes to the links in these boxes so that  they appear in different colors when they have been visited or when they are active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               [ 246 ]               Chapter 10  Changing the layout  Modifying the way our wiki looks isn't limited to just changing the background color or the color of the text. Within MediaWiki, we have control over the page layout as well. In this section, we are going to cover how to go about customizing the existing layout by making  changes to page sections and by moving them around the page. However, before we get into  making changes, we have to understand the PHP file associated with the skins.  As stated earlier, when making changes to a skin, we need to look at the PHP file associated  with the skin, not the skin.php file. For instance, if we wish to make changes to the  MonoBook skin, we need to make them in the MonoBook.php file.  Let's start by taking a look at the MonoBook.php file that can be found in the skins directory. This is a large file so we will only look at a small part of it to get an understanding  of its structure. The first part of the skin file contains the block of PHP code where  the MonoBook skin class is created by extending the existing SkinTemplate and QuickTemplate classes that define the skin being used. The main function that describes  the layout and contents of the skin is the execute function under the MonoBookTemplate class. The code block is as follows:  class MonoBookTemplate extends QuickTemplate {   **  * Template filter callback for MonoBook skin.  * Takes an associative array of data set from a SkinTemplate-based  * class, and a wrapper for MediaWiki's localization database, and  * outputs a formatted page.  *  * @access private  *   function execute   {     Suppress warnings to prevent notices about missing indexes in      $this->data wfSuppressWarnings  ; ?>  After the above code block, we have an XHTML code section up to the end of the  MonoBook.php file. The XHTML page template consists of a number of div sections.  Each div is identified by either or both an id and class attribute in the   tag. The stylesheet then controls how each div block is drawn, and where on the page it  is positioned.  [ 247 ]               Advanced Customization  Take a look at the following code snippet of the MonoBook.php file:      msg 'personaltools'  ?>       data['personal_urls'] as $key => $item  { ?>  ">  "   class=" "  >                    text 'logopath'  ?> ;"   href="  data['nav_urls'] ['mainpage']['href'] ?>"  msg 'mainpage'  ?>">      As you can see, there is a division,  , with the ID p-personal and class portlet. These   tags work as individual blocks and together they build the layout of the page. If you examine the full code section, you will find that many similar   tags have been used, and corresponding stylesheets have been declared in the folders named according  to the skin names. So for the MonoBook skin, we have a folder named monobook, and the CSS file that defines the style rules for the page is main.css. The portlet class that we have seen in the code snippet defines the basic style of the div blocks not part of the main content area. Each block is furnished with the style defined for it in the stylesheet that is  referred to by the div ID or class.  The main page section is a block with the ID column-content that contains the block  with the ID content. The content block contains the main content heading with  the firstHeading class and the bodyContent block, which contains a subheading identifying the MediaWiki site name, the contentSub block, the actual page contents, and a visualClear block. Let's explore a few important identifiers in the main.css file for  the MonoBook skin.   column-content: It is used to define the overall space within the margins of which    content: It is the white background, thin bordered box that contains the content for  the content exists  the main page  [ 248 ]               Chapter 10   firstHeading: It is the class of the heading tag at the top of every page  bodyContent: It actually contains the main page content within the content box  contentSub: It defines the style of text that indicates the name of the wiki   immediately underneath the main heading, but above the body text  The portlets section is a block with the ID column-one, containing portlet blocks with the IDs p-cactions, p-personal, p-logo, p-nav, p-search, and p-tb. At the bottom  of the page is a block with the ID footer, containing the f-poweredbyico and f-list blocks. The portlet.css class is the style used by all the div blocks around the main content. The following is a list of blocks using the portlet.css class:   p-cactions: It is the ID for the list of tabs above the main content  p-personal: It is the ID for the list of links that include the login or logout link at  the top of the page   p-logo: It is the ID for the block that contains the logo  on the top left   p-nav: It is the ID for the block that contains the navigation links on the left of   the page   p-search: It is the block that contains the search buttons  p-tb: It is the block that contains the toolbox links  The footer at the bottom of the page includes blocks with the following IDs:   footer: It is the block that contains the overall footer  f-list: It is the list for all additional links in the footer section except the   copyright and powered-by icon  Now that we have an idea about the layout and style properties for the skins, we can start  to explore by changing the layout and then modifying the CSS to change the look of the site even more.  Pop quiz – understanding blocks I know, you are anxious to get started with the exercises. Before we start, let's make sure that you have a good understanding of the different blocks used in the skins that MediaWiki  installs by default.  1. Which ID would have information regarding the site's logo?   logo a. b. image c. p-logo logo ID d.  [ 249 ]               Advanced Customization  2. The block identified as p-tb contains links for the:  3.  top navigation toolbox links in text links in the navigation box  a. b. c. d.  The main content is identified by the block named: a. p-caction b. p-caption c. p-main d. bodyContent  If you answered all three questions correctly, then you are good to move on to the exercises.  If you answered any of them wrong, go back and review what the different blocks are  responsible for before moving on. After all, we don't want you moving the footer when   you think you are editing the main content area.  Time for action – changing the footer There are many different reasons why we would want to modify the footer for our wiki. We  may need to add a link, delete a link, change the wording, and so on. One change that we will be making in this exercise is to remove the text that tells when the site was last modified.  1. Using your file manager or FTP program, open the MonoBook.php file for editing. It   can be found at \public_html\skins\.  2.  Locate the following lines of code:    <?php if $this->data['poweredbyico']  { ?>   html 'poweredbyico'  ? >  <?php } if $this->data['copyrightico']  { ?>   html 'copyrightico'  ? >  <?php }  [ 250 ]               Chapter 10     Generate additional footer links $footerlinks = array  'lastmod', 'viewcount', 'numberofwatchingusers', 'credits', 'copyright', 'privacy', 'about', 'disclaimer', 'tagline',  ; $validFooterLinks = array  ; foreach  $footerlinks as $aLink   { if  isset  $this->data[$aLink]   && $this->data[$aLink]   { $validFooterLinks[] = $aLink; } } if   count  $validFooterLinks   > 0   { ? >      <?php foreach  $validFooterLinks as $aLink   { if  isset  $this->data[$aLink]   && $this->data[$aLink]   { ?>       "> html $aLink  ?><  li>  <?php    } } ?>   <? php } ?>    These lines provide information about the footer section of our wiki.  3. Now, we need to remove 'lastmod' from the links section:     Generate additional footer links $footerlinks = array 'lastmod', 'viewcount',  'numberofwatchingusers', 'credits',  'copyright','privacy', 'about', 'disclaimer',  'tagline',  ;  [ 251 ]               Advanced Customization  4. After   hit Enter and insert the following lines:      Top of the page      This will add a link to the footer that will take you back to the top of the page.  5.  Save your changes.  The following screenshot shows the changes made to the footer:  What just happened? In order to modify the footer, we learned that we need to open the PHP file associated with  the skin we are changing. In the previous exercise, we modified the MonoBook.php file so  that the last modified date no longer shows up on the wiki. We also added a line of code that  creates a link taking us back to the top of the page. To add a link, we need to add HTML to  the file similar to the following:      Link Text     Of course, we would change the link to something we wish to link to such as another website or a page in our wiki. The link text would reflect where we are sending our visitor.  Have a go hero By default, MediaWiki places a small graphic file in the footer of every wiki that runs its  software. While it is considered common courtesy to leave the "Powered by MediaWiki"  image link on your site, there are times when the administrator may want to remove it.  The name of this image is poweredbyico. With this information, see if you can remove this  icon from your skin's file. If you really want a challenge, replace the icon with something that  better suits your wiki.  [ 252 ]               Chapter 10  Time for action – changing the navigation links Well, we decided to work backwards from here. As we modified the footer in the last exer- cise, it is only appropriate that we edit the navigation box in this one. This task is significantly  easier than the last one because site navigation is something that almost every website  administrator wants to customize. For this task, we won't have to work with any PHP or CSS,  just plain, old-fashioned wikitext!  1. Open your wiki and log in using the sysop account. 2.  In the title field of your wiki's URL, add the text MediaWiki:Sidebar.  For example, in the sample we have been using, the URL would show up   as http:  www.flosspropopulo.com index.php MediaWiki:Sidebar. After you hit Enter, you will see a page similar to the following screenshot:  3. Normally, you would click on the edit tab at the top of the page. However, the first time you edit this page, you may have to click on the create tab if the edit tab is not present.  4. Add a new navigation link to the list. Links are listed in the format:   **targetcaption. In our example, we are going to link to a new page called Tutorials, so we would add **tutorialsTutorials. If you wish to link to another website, you can use a URL as your target as well.  5. Also add this line, **Special:listusersUser List. Notice that to link to a   special page, we need to include Special, a colon  : , and then the page title.  6.  Save your changes. As this is a major edit, you may want to include a comment!  [ 253 ]               Advanced Customization  Now, the navigation box found on the left-hand side of your wiki should have the newly-created  links as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? With a bit of added wikitext, we were able to add a new link to our navigation box on the  side of the screen. To do this, we navigated to the MediaWiki:Sidebar page and added a bit of syntax. We can use this to add new pages, links to Special pages, and links to other websites as well. If we wanted to delete an existing link, we could do that here as well.  Have a go hero I couldn't let you get away that easy so here is your challenge.  Did you notice when you were adding the Tutorials link to the navigation box that there were  entries for SEARCH, TOOLBOX, and LANGUAGES as well? Using what you have learned, move the search box so that it is directly above the navigation box.  Time for action – moving sections on a page                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         [ 254 ]                                                                                                    Chapter 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [ 255 ]               Advanced Customization  4.  5.  6.  Locate the following code in MonoBook.php:    text 'logopath'   ?> ; "  href=" data  ['nav_urls']['mainpage']['href'] ?>"<?php echo $skin->tooltipAndAccesskey 'p-logo'  ?>>     Insert the search box code you just cut from your file directly under the   tag. You can hit Enter a few times first to make some space in the code.  Save your changes.  If you did everything correctly, when you open your wiki, you should see that the search  box is now directly under your logo and right over the navigation box, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 256 ]               Chapter 10  What just happened? By moving the placement of the code that drives the search box, we were able to move the placement of the search box when the page renders in a web browser. When we did this, the search box was relocated so that it is directly beneath the logo on our page and right above the navigation box.  When we change the order in which the code for our skin file is parsed, we change the  appearance. If we wanted to move other sections around, we could do so by moving the  code just as we did here. Remember though, we have to make sure that the section we are  moving doesn't overlap an existing section or our page will not be displayed properly. If you  wish to make major changes to the layout of the skin, I would suggest you pick up a copy of MediaWiki Skins Design by Richard Carter. This book will take you through the ins and outs of  designing your own skins to use on your site.  Have a go hero Some of you may have found the last exercise a bit challenging, as it involved tearing through the code. If you are one of those people who want an even greater challenge, give this a try.  Knowing that moving the location of the code in the file will move the sections around, try  your hand at moving some other sections. Don't worry if your page doesn't look right. If  you overlap, just revert to the original file. This will teach you which sections can be moved  without problems. Remember, you can learn quite a bit from taking something apart.  Of course, you can go in to the other skin's PHP files and move sections around there as well.  Customizing user capabilities  We have seen in previous exercises how we can use the LocalSettings.php file to define  what users can see and do on our wiki through permissions. The ability to define what  users can see and do is extremely important, especially if the wiki you are building contains information that may be sensitive or restricted.  Yet, sometimes we just want to disable certain features of our wiki because it makes the user  experience better. As we will see in the next exercise, the LocalSettings.php file is not  the only one we can modify to customize how our wiki functions.  [ 257 ]               Advanced Customization  Time for action – disable the ability to change skins Let's say that you have spent quite a bit of time customizing how your wiki looks to your  visitors. You have made the changes we covered in the book, have risen to the challenges, and even went off on your own to learn more about MediaWIki skins and applied this to  your MonoBook skin. Your wiki is looking great!  Now suppose you have a user who logs in and changes the skin to Simple. All your hard work is now lost on this user, or any others who change their skins on your site.  Luckily, if you wish for a consistent look across your wiki, you can force this by making a few changes to a little file called SpecialPreferences.php that can be found in .. public_ html includes specials .  1. Using your file manager or FTP program, open the SpecialPreferences.php file   for editing.  2.  Locate the following lines of code:  Skin  global $wgAllowUserSkin; if  $wgAllowUserSkin   { $wgOut->addHTML  " \n \n" . wfMsg  'skin'    " \n"  ; $mptitle = Title::newMainPage  ; $previewtext = wfMsg  'skin-preview'  ;  Only show members of Skin::getSkinNames   rather than  $skinNames  skins is all skin names from Language.php  $validSkinNames = Skin::getUsableSkins  ;  Sort by UI skin name. First though need to update  validSkinNames as sometimes the skinkey & UI skinname differ    e.g. "standard" skinkey is "Classic" in the UI . foreach   $validSkinNames as $skinkey => &$skinname   { $msgName = "skinname-{$skinkey}"; $localisedSkinName = wfMsg  $msgName  ; if   !wfEmptyMsg  $msgName, $localisedSkinName      { $skinname = $localisedSkinName; } } asort $validSkinNames ; foreach  $validSkinNames as $skinkey => $sn   { $checked = $skinkey == $this->mSkin ? ' checked="checked"'  : ''; $mplink = htmlspecialchars  $mptitle->getLocalURL    "useskin=$skinkey"    ;  [ 258 ]               Chapter 10  $previewlink = " <a target='_blank'  href=\"$mplink\">$previewtext  "; $extraLinks = ''; global $wgAllowUserCss, $wgAllowUserJs; if  $wgAllowUserCss   { $cssPage = Title::makeTitleSafe  NS_USER,  $wgUser->getName  .'

Save your changes.  3. Comment out this code by placing a  * before the line that reads  Skin and a *   [ 259 ]               Advanced Customization  Now, when your users try to change the skin under my preferences, they see this:  Notice that there is no longer a Skins tab so the user cannot change this option.  What just happened? In order to protect the aesthetics of our page, and to make sure that everyone sees the same  thing when they visit our wiki, we used the SpecialPreferences.php file to disable the  ability for our users to change skins. What we did was comment out the section that defines  this in the file. Doing so causes MediaWiki to ignore the code and thus, the function is  disabled and our wiki still looks good.  Hacking MediaWiki  Hacking is a term that is still misunderstood. When we speak of hacking, we are talking  about making modifications to something. In this case, we are talking about making  modifications to our MediaWiki installation to suit our needs. A hacker is a person who creates and modifies, or hacks, software. This is done by employing a series of modifications  to exploit, and  or extend, existing code or resources. Though the word hacking has negative  impact in various societies, most hackers do not have bad intentions. A positive meaning of  "hacker" can be someone who knows a set of programming interfaces well enough to write software rapidly and expertly. We will take this definition for our purpose. We will learn how  to modify or add features to MediaWiki rapidly by understanding the internal structure and interfaces. We are not going to learn how to damage or deface a wiki through any malicious  hacking techniques.  The file structure We already know that MediaWiki is built on PHP and MySQL. So in order to add or modify  anything in MediaWiki, we need to have sound knowledge of PHP and MySQL. So far we  have applied our basic PHP knowledge in the LocalSettings.php file, but now we need  to apply more of our knowledge to edit the existing code base, and also a bit of patience to  work on it. Let's look at the core MediaWiki files, some of which will be modified as required:  [ 260 ]               Chapter 10  Filename  index.php   Article.php   EditPage.php   Parser.php   Linker.php   Database.php   OutputPage.php   Title.php   User.php   Setup.php   DefaultSettings. php  Description This is the main entry point to the application. This page redirects to other pages based on the passed parameters.  This page contains code for viewing, deleting, watching, and unwatching a page. It also contains basic functions responsible for a part of the editing functionality, such as fetching a revision and saving a page. When we edit a page, all article-related information such as article name, article contents, and so on are provided by the Article.php file. Database and text operations are done  through the Article.php file as well. This page contains code for editing a page. A part of the editing, however, is handled by the Article.php file. This page contains the code for parsing wiki syntax to HTML tags.  This page contains code for generating HTML code for links and images.  This page contains all the functions for separate database operation.  This page is used as output buffer. All the text is sent to this class before being shown on screen or in other media.  As the name suggests, this page is solely responsible for displaying and saving page titles.  This page contains the user-related code—especially code sections for user preference and permission.  This page initializes all variables used in MediaWiki. A part of the initialization also involves the global variables and objects.  This page contains the default values for all the variables used in MediaWiki. If some values need to be changed or redefined,  they are defined in the LocalSettings.php file.  Now we know which files exist and what they do. So it is better to study these files very well  before making any changes. Though the code is not very well organized, you can still make  out some meaning by reading the contents.  [ 261 ]               Advanced Customization  Time for action – making your wiki private One of the biggest concerns about wikis is that anyone can edit them. In fact, most wikis encourage the community to create and edit content and suggest that if you don't need all of a wiki's functionality, a Content Management System  CMS  may be a better choice.  However, there may be times when you want the functionality of a wiki, but you only want  certain people to be able to log in to access your content.  In this exercise, we are going to use some of our prior knowledge to hack MediaWiki so that we can prevent people from creating accounts. Once we have done this, we are going to lock  down our wiki so that unless you are given a username by your sysop, you cannot get in to read any of the content.  Using your FTP program or your file manager, open up the LocalSettings.php file so that  you can edit it.  1. At the bottom of the file, add the  Lockdown our wiki. This will be the comment  that lets us know later on that the following code will be used for this hack. If you wish to open up your wiki at a later time, you can remove the code we enter here.  2. Add the following line of code: $wgGroupPermissions['*']  ['createaccount'] = false; This removes the create account from your login link as shown in the following screenshot. Visitors will not be able to create accounts; the sysop user still has  this ability.  [ 262 ]               Chapter 10  3. Now add the following code below the last line we just added:    Disable reading line, for anonymous  not-logged-in => *   :  $wgGroupPermissions['*']['read'] = false;   Enable anonymous to read the followings pages : $wgWhitelistRead = array  "Main Page", "Special:Userlogin", "-", "MediaWiki:Monobook.css"  ;  This gives visitors access to the Main Page and the Log in page, but nothing else.  4.  Save your edits.  Now, whenever a visitor who is not logged in tries to access a page other than the  Main Page or the Log in page, they will be greeted with a message as shown in the following screenshot:  What just happened? By using the skills we have learned in this book, we were able to hack the MediaWiki LocalSettings.php file to make our wiki inaccessible to anyone who does not have a  username and password.  As MediaWiki was built to allow even visitors the opportunity to create and edit pages, our modifications tailored the software to fit our needs. By hacking the software, we altered the  way it performs. Our hack was not done to damage the software or the site in any way.  Time for action – enhancing custom namespaces We learned back in Chapter 7 that namespaces are used to organize content that have  a similar purpose. MediaWiki provides us with 18 built-in namespaces. As we determined  that we needed an additional namespace for our tutorials, we created Tutorials and  Tutorials_Talk.  [ 263 ]               Advanced Customization  However, now that our skill set with MediaWiki has grown, let's enhance the functionality of  the Tutorials namespace. We can give this namespace the ability to have subpages created  for all tutorials so if we want to organize a tutorial by operating system, we can use the Sub- page feature. Also, we will make this namespace searchable because, by default only pages  in certain namespaces are searchable. Others need to be selected from the Search page.  Also, this hack allows content in the Tutorials namespace to appear when the random page feature link is clicked.  So, if you are ready, let's enhance the namespace called Tutorial.  1. Open the LocatSettings.php file with either the file manager or the FTP program. 2.  In a new window, open your favorite text editor. We will be copying lines of code here to transfer to our LocalSettings.php file.  Remember, any edits to the  DefaultSettings.php file will be overwritten when we upgrade our  MediaWiki software.   3.  Locate and copy the lines of code that read: $wgNamespacesWithSubpages = array   These lines can be found starting around line number 1949. Once they are copied,  paste them to your text editor file. Once all the lines of code have been copied to  the text editor, you can close the DefaultSettings.php file.  NS_TALK           =>true, NS_USER           =>true, NS_USER_TALK      =>true, NS_PROJECT_TALK   =>true, NS_FILE_TALK      =>true, NS_MEDIAWIKI_TALK =>true, NS_TEMPLATE_TALK  =>true, NS_HELP_TALK      =>true, NS_CATEGORY_TALK  =>true   ;   ;  $wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault = array   NS_MAIN           =>true  4.  Edit the file so that it looks like this:  $wgNamespacesWithSubpages = array   NS_TALK           => true, NS_USER           => true, NS_USER_TALK      => true, NS_PROJECT_TALK   => true,  [ 264 ]               Chapter 10  NS_FILE_TALK      => true, NS_MEDIAWIKI_TALK => true, NS_TEMPLATE_TALK  => true, NS_HELP_TALK      => true, NS_CATEGORY_TALK  => true, TUTORIALS         => true, TUTORIALS_TALK    => true   ;   ;  $wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault = array     NS_MAIN           => true, TUTORIALS          => true  Of course you can substitute Tutorials for the title of the custom namespace of  your wiki where ever it occurs in this file.  5. Open up the LocalSettings.php file for editing. 6. Copy the code from the text editor and paste it into the LocalSettings.php file. 7.  Save your changes.  What just happened? The hack we just performed gave our previously created Tutorials and Tutorials_Talk  namespaces the ability to be searched by default—users no longer are required to select them from the Search page—and their content will appear using the Random page link in the navigation box.  We also provided this namespace with the ability to house subpages. Let's say we are creating  a tutorial on installing OpenOffice.org. Now, the tutorial can be created in the Tutorials  namespace and we can create three subpages—for Microsoft Windows, GNU Linux, and one  for Macintosh users. Using this, we can avoid having one huge page that covers the installation  process for all three operating systems.  Most importantly, we learned that there are many different ways to extend the functionality  of our wiki. As we grow more comfortable with our wiki administration abilities and our  PHP programming skills, we can hack the MediaWiki core even further to make our system perform exactly the way we want it to!  [ 265 ]               Advanced Customization  Have a go hero If you are ready for an even greater challenge when it comes to hacking MediaWiki, then step up to the plate, because here it comes!  When we created the Tutorials namespace, we intended it to be available to all visitors to our site. Since then we have changed our minds and decided that only registered users will be able to access this feature. In our situation, we can encourage visitors to register for our  site by offering them content that they would not be able to see otherwise. However, the  applications of this hack can prove to be extremely useful in a corporate setting as well.  We have seen ways to limit access to our site in previous exercises, but in this particular  challenge, you are going to learn how to prevent unauthorized access to a namespace, the Tutorials namespace.  To do this, visit http:  sourceforge.net projects hiddenwiki  and download the Hidden namespaces patch. When you extract the files, there is a README file included that  will help you with the appropriate configuration settings to the LocalSettings.php file.  This hack requires you to be able to install the patch to your server so you may need the help  of your hosting provider.  Summary  This chapter was especially important because we learned how to modify the look and  functionality of our wiki so that it not only has the appearance that we want, but also  the functionality.  We started this chapter by learning about ways we can change the wiki's appearance. First we looked at the different skins that users can apply to the wiki when they log in. Then, we  moved into locating the skin files so we could learn how to make changes to the skin file that  are reflected across the wiki.  When working with the skin files, we covered CSS and saw how these files are responsible  for the layout, text, and color scheme that our wiki's skins follow. By changing the CSS files, we were able to change background colors, background images, text, and any other  aesthetics we may wish.  As we moved along, we learned how to go about modifying the footer. In the sample, we added a link that took us back to the top of the page, removed some text, and we were challenged to use the same techniques to remove the "Powered By MediaWiki" icon from the footer. With this knowledge in hand, we took on the task of moving the search box  so that it appears above the navigation box, and then we learned how we can move the  different content sections around the page as well.  [ 266 ]               Chapter 10  After we learned how to make our wiki look the way we want, the task of keeping these  changes consistent came next. We learned how to disable the user's ability to change skins so that all of our hard work in creating the perfect-looking wiki was not thrown out the  window should a user select a different skin.  Finally, we learned some hacks we could apply to MediaWiki that would extend its functionality even further. For starters, we applied a hack that would make our wiki private.  Once this was in place, only the sysop could create new users for our wiki. Next, we looked at a way we could increase the functionality of the namespace we created back in Chapter 7.  We have spent a lot of time over the last few chapters learning how to get our wiki looking,  and working the way we want it to. In the next chapter, we are going to learn how we can maintain our wiki so that it continues to run smoothly.  [ 267 ]                            11  Maintaining MediaWiki  Throughout the course of this book, we have installed MediaWiki on our server,  configured and customized it to our liking, and added pages of content for our  visitors. However, our work is not yet done. Actually, the work of the MediaWiki  sysop is really never done because he or she should always be working to main- tain their site and its software, so it continues running smoothly and providing  its audience with the content and service they expect.  This chapter is dedicated to teaching you how to perform certain tasks that can help keep  your site running efficiently and effectively even in the event of a disaster. Specifically, in this  chapter we will cover:   How to run maintenance scripts  How to back up your wiki  How to restore your wiki from a backup  How to upgrade the MediaWiki software  Once you have covered all of the exercises that teach you how to perform these tasks, you will be well on your way to becoming an expert MediaWiki sysop. So, let's get started by looking  at some of built-in tools that MediaWiki has that will help with the upkeep of your site.               Maintaining MediaWiki  Maintenance scripts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [ 270 ]               Chapter 11  2. Using your file manager or FTP program, upload and extract the   MaintenanceShell.x.x.x.zip file to the extensions folder of your MediaWiki installation. This is usually found in the extensions directory. If you are extracting the files on the server, this will create  a new folder named MaintenanceShell.x.x.x. If this is the case, rename this folder to MaintenanceShell. If you have extracted  the files on your local machine, you will need to move the entire  MaintenanceShell folder to the extensions directory on the server.  3. Open your LocalSettings.php file for editing and add the following lines to  provide members of the sysop group access to the special page created by the MaintenanceShell extension:  Grant sysop access to MaintenanceShell  $wgGroupPermissions[‘sysop'][‘maintenanceshell'] = true4;  4. At the very last line of your LocalSettings.php file, add the following lines of   code: MaintenanceShell extension Require_once "$IP extensions MaintenanceShell MaintenanceShell. php" ;  This line ensures that all the settings are loaded when the MaintenanceShell is run.  Make certain this is always the last line of your LocalSettings.php file to ensure  that everything is included when the MaintenanceShell is run.  5.  Save your settings. If you log into your wiki with a sysop administrator account, you will see a new  page added to the Special pages called Maintenance Shell as shown in the     [ 271 ]            Maintaining MediaWiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        [ 272 ]               Chapter 11  7.  8.  In the available scripts, click on the script named checkUsernames. Notice that this  will populate the Script name textbox. Alternately, you can type the name of the script, checkUsernames, in this box.  In the Command line options box, type:--user User --password newone Here, User is the username and newone will be the new password for User.  9. Click the Run script button and you will be taken to the following page:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              [ 273 ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Maintaining MediaWiki  Backing up your wiki  If you installed your wiki on a server owned by a hosting provider, then odds are it will be  backed up for you every night. Should something happen to the server, there will always be a recent copy of your site on file with the company so they can easily restore the site; often  times your provider will do this for you.  However, it is always good practice to back up your sites on your own instead of relying on  someone else to do it for you. Before we begin, we need to take a look at how everything is stored in our wiki. MediaWiki stores important data in two locations:   The database where pages and their contents, users and their preferences,   metadata, search index, and so on are stored    The filesystem where software configuration files, custom skins, extensions, images    including deleted images , and so on are stored  So if you are ready, let's step into the next couple of exercises where you will learn how to back up both your database and your wiki's filesystem.  Time for action – backing up the database Throughout this book, we have used phpMyAdmin whenever we have had to work with the  database. If you haven't been told on how much easier it makes your life by now, this will certainly bring you around.  In this exercise, we are going to use phpMyAdmin to back up the database for our wiki. If you do not have access to phpMyAdmin, then you may need to contact your hosting provider for  instructions on how to back up your database.  1. Open up phpMyAdmin for your site and log in. 2. From the upper left-hand corner, select the database that corresponds to your wiki. 3. Click on the Export tab at the top of the page. This will open the page as shown in   the following screenshot:  [ 274 ]               Chapter 11  4.  On the export page, we need to check for the following:          That  all of the tables are selected  1 . That SQL is selected as the export type  2 . That Save as file is checked  3 . That Structure and Add DROP TABLE  4  is selected to add the drop  table functionality if the table already exists in the database backup.  If you wish to compress the backup file, select zipped or gzipped.  5. 6. Click on the Go button. This will save your file to the location you determine. This   is based on your browser settings, so if you are using the Firefox default, the   file will be saved to your desktop.  [ 275 ]               Maintaining MediaWiki  What just happened? Using a third-party tool, phpMyAdmin, we were able to back up our database using the Export tool. This tool generates a .sql file that we can later import should our database  become damaged or corrupted. As this is only half of what we need to fully restore our wiki, we need to look at how we back up the filesystem next.  Time for action – backing up the filesystem Unlike the database, the filesystem does not require any third-party tools to perform the  backup. All we need to do is copy selected files from our server using either our FTP program  or our file manager.  1. Navigate to the MediaWiki files and folders on your server using the file manager   or FTP program.  2.  Select the files you wish to back up. These usually are:          Configuration files such as LocalSettings.php or DefaultSettings.php Folders that contain image files The extensions folder The skins folder  Any other files or folders that contain important information should be selected  as well.  3. Copy the files folders to your local computer. It generally helps if you keep all   of these files and folders in one folder so they reside in the same place.  4. Compress the folder that houses everything you copied down from your server.  What just happened? That last exercise was so easy that I wouldn't blame you if you were still looking for the next  step. All we have to do to back up our wiki's files is save them to a storage location. Saving  them on your local computer is fine for now, but if you have a large wiki, you may need to  invest in some sort of attached storage device to hold everything.  [ 276 ]               Chapter 11  Have a go hero We saw how easy it was to back up both the database and the filesystem for our wiki. Now,  we are going to combine our first exercise in with our backup as well.  One of the maintenance scripts—dumpBackup.php—will create what is called as an XML dump of all the content of your wiki, without the site-related data. When you run this file, you  have the option of creating a full dump of everything in the page's history, or you can opt for  just the current contents. You can also select all pages, as well as choose selected pages to include in the dump. As the dump creates an XML file, you can share your content with anyone.  Go ahead and run this maintenance script. Once you are done, open the file to see how the  page content is organized. In order to get the file, you will need to specify where you want  the dump sent. More information can be found here:  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Manual:DumpBackup.php.  Restoring from a backup  Again, if you are using a hosting provider, the chances that you will have to restore your wiki  due to a natural disaster are slim. However, if your wiki is defaced or vandalized, you may be on your own when it comes to restoring files and content.  While MediaWiki has many countermeasures in place that allow you to undo vandalism, there may be a time where damage is too severe, or too widespread, and it would be easier  to just restore the content from a backup you know is void of any damage.  For those of us who are creating a wiki for personal reasons, or for a hobby, a well-developed  backup schedule can save a great deal of heartache. However, if you are developing a wiki for your company or business, it is imperative that not only you keep best practices in mind  when it comes to backing up your wiki, but also test the restore process. Nothing is worse than a false sense of security from thinking that your backup is working fine. Unless you test  it out by restoring the data, you never know until it is too late.  There is one word of advice regarding backups that you should be aware of. In this exercise,  we will be writing directly over our existing database to test out our backup. In the real  world, we would never write over a database that is working perfectly just to test our backups.  A better solution would be to run a development server that mirrors your wiki  exactly. You can do this on a local machine if you want.  Another solution would be to mirror your wiki in a subdomain on your site. This way, you can  test out new extensions, test your backup, see if there are any issues with updates, and so on without interfering with your live wiki site.  Of course, if you are just messing around and learning MediaWiki, feel free to overwrite your database in this instance like I am doing.  [ 277 ]               Maintaining MediaWiki  Time for action – restoring the database backup When we backed up our database, we made use of the phpMyAdmin export tool to save a copy of all the tables in our database. If you guessed that we will be using the import tool to restore the data, then you are absolutely right!  If you are one of the few who does not have access to phpMyAdmin through your hosting  company, alter the directions so you can restore the data using your own tool. You will be  surprised at how easily you will be able to do this after all the experience you have built up  over the course of this book.  1. Open phpMyAdmin for your site. 2. Choose the appropriate database from the upper left-hand corner of the screen. 3.  From the tabs across the top of the screen, click on the one that says Import. When you click this, you will be presented with a screen identical to the  following screenshot:  [ 278 ]               Chapter 11  4.  In the textbox labeled, Location of the text file, you will need to click the Browse button and locate your earlier export file.  5. Make sure that the Format of the imported file has SQL selected. 6. Click the Go button. This will now send your backup file to the database where it   will populate the tables.  The result of a successful import should look similar to the following screenshot:  Now, the number of queries that are successful may vary depending on each individual  wiki. You may have more or less. Problems arise when you see something similar to the  following screenshot:  [ 279 ]                                                  Maintaining MediaWiki                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                [ 280 ]                                                                                                                                                                              4.  Make the following changes to these variables:  Chapter 11              $IP: Set this to the correct path for the new server or  new installation. $wgScriptPath: Set this to the correct path for the new server or new installation. $wgDBserver: Make sure that the database server name is correct. For a new installation, this may not need to be changed.  If you have installed on a new server, you will probably have to change this. $wgDBname: Make sure that the database name is correct. Change it to reflect the new database name. $wgDBuser: Make sure that the database username is correct. Change it to reflect the new database user if this is incorrect. $wgDBpassword: Check to make sure that this is the correct password for the database user. If it is not, change this to reflect to  right password.  5.  Test your site!  What just happened? Since restoring the filesystem is as simple as moving the old files we backed up to the new  installation of MediaWiki, or new server, we went ahead and looked at what variables in  the LocalSettings.php file may need to be changed in order for our wiki to function  properly. Most of these will change if we moved to a new hosting company, however, if we  are working to rebuild these files on a fresh installation of MediaWiki on the same server,  not everything needs to be changed.

All of the above  Upgrading MediaWiki  MediaWiki has a large development community that is always looking to make the software  better. As a result, it undergoes quite a few upgrades. It is necessary for you to upgrade  the software when new releases are available. Not only does the latest release offer more  features, but usually there are security updates included in the upgrade to help keep the malicious users at bay.  Upgrading any software can cause a multitude of problems for you. Before you upgrade,  make sure that the release you are using is a stable release and not one that is still in testing.  Installing a version of the software that is still in beta testing can cause your site to crash  and leave your site open to attack. If you are confident that the latest release is stable, you  should still test the upgrade on a development site first if you have that luxury. If you do not  test the upgrade first, you could find out the hard way that the latest release doesn't work  with certain extensions or third-party applications.  Time for action – upgrading MediaWiki Currently, MediaWiki is at release 1.15.1. If you recently installed the software, you may not  be able to upgrade because a newer version may not be available yet. If you are using an installer such as Fantastico, or one provided by your hosting company, then when you log in  you should be alerted when a new release is available for MediaWiki.  When the time comes that you need to upgrade your MediaWiki installation, these are the  steps you need to follow. Many people simply click on the upgrade button from their hosting  control panel. Failure to upgrade the right way can really cause some serious damage to  your site.  1. Check the requirements. Make sure that you are running the correct version of PHP  and MySQL, or PostgreSQL. If you are not, you will need to upgrade these first.  2. Read the release notes. These are available to you on the MediaWiki site correspond-  ing to the release you are installing. If everything checks out, then proceed.  [ 282 ]               Chapter 11  3. Back up your files and database. You won't need to use them unless something bad   happens. If something bad happens, you will be glad you backed everything up.  4. Run the update script from your installer or control panel. 5.  Log in to your wiki and open the Maintenance Shell page. From this page, run the script called update. This checks the database schema to see if it will work  with the upgrade.  6. Check your installed extensions to see if they need to be upgraded as well. 7.  Test your upgraded wiki site.  When you upgrade, there is a chance that you will lose some of your configurations. Be  aware of this. If this happens, simply reconfigure your wiki or move the backed up file that  contains the changes to the server and rewrite the upgraded file.  What just happened? In this last exercise, we learned what steps we need to take when upgrading MediaWiki  to the latest release. We were informed that simply clicking on the upgrade button in our  hosting provider's control panel could cause damage to our wiki if we aren't careful. We  also learned that it is important to back up our wiki before we upgrade and test the upgrade before we use it on our live site.  Summary  This chapter was short, but it was very important as it taught us how to keep our wiki  running smoothly. We learned how to back up our database using phpMyAdmin, and our filesystem by copying important files, so that in the event of a disaster we could restore our  wiki back to its functional state. We also learned how to restore our wiki from these backups;  most importantly, we saw that we need to test our backups frequently by restoring them to see if everything is working.  We also covered how to install a special extension called Maintenance Shell. This extension  gives those of us who don't have terminal shell access on our server the ability to run the maintenance scripts that MediaWiki offers.  Finally, we covered the steps we should take when upgrading our MediaWiki software. While  many times, the upgrade is done by the simple click of a button, there are steps we need to  take prior to the actual upgrade to make sure we don't damage our wiki.  We are almost done! In the next, and final chapter, we are going to learn how we can  integrate MediaWiki with some other web applications such as WordPress and Joomla!  to build even more robust sites.  [ 283 ]                            12  Integrating MediaWiki  One of the greatest things about working with free open source software  packages is that the development community works extremely hard to enhance  the functionality of the different software packages. The spirit of the free open  source software movement is especially evident in the fact that many of these  applications can be integrated so that they work with one another by sharing  user accounts and other database information.  Through the use of extensions, MediaWiki can be integrated with other web  applications as well. With a few modifications, MediaWiki can work alongside  other platforms such as WordPress blogging software, Moodle learning man- agement system, and Joomla! content management system.  As stated previously, the integration works because some of the different  modifications made to the applications, through extensions in MediaWiki's  case, allow the databases to be shared. By integrating two or more of these  programs, users will benefit by either having a single sign-on and or the ability  to easily access content between the various programs.  In this chapter, we will learn how to:   Integrate MediaWiki with WordPress  Integrate MediaWiki with Joomla!  Integrate MediaWiki with Moodle  Apply OpenID signons to MediaWiki               Integrating MediaWiki  It is important to note that many of these extensions allow the other program access to  the MediaWiki database. Although the book will explain what needs to be done to the other program to allow MediaWiki access, the steps will not include how to modify or hack the code of the shared program that will allow MediaWiki access to the companion program's database. In order to maximize the integration between the two programs, you  will have to take on the Have a Go Hero challenges that help you create a bi-directional  integration. While the steps are not provided, you will be given enough information to use  the techniques learned throughout this book to make this happen.  For some of the examples in the following exercises, I will be using fresh installations of  each software package instead of referencing the Floss Pro Populo wiki that we have created  throughout the book. The reason for this is that in many cases of integration, both the  wiki software and the companion software it will be integrating with need to be installed  on the same server in the webroot directory. The emphasis here is to make sure that the  integration works before taking it live. You would never want to install another software  package into the root of your working wiki as that could cause huge problems if not done correctly. Instead, we will concentrate on creating working installations of the software  packages. If we need to move our wiki content, we can always use the steps outlined in Chapter 11, Maintaining MediaWiki.  If you are ready, let's begin.  Integrating MediaWiki with WordPress  The largest social web tool to hit the Internet is by far the introduction of blogging software.  Many companies make use of blogs so that they can promote products, educate their customers, or even provide their employees with a forum on which they can express themselves. Huge companies such as BlueCoat and IBM make use of blogs in these   exact scenarios.  If your company is already using a blog, or perhaps you are planning to start one, then integrating the blog with MediaWiki can allow you to display comments made on a  WordPress blog into your wiki or allow newly-created wiki pages to appear on the blog.  In order for the following exercises to work, you will need to install WordPress onto your server. The WordPress installation should be in a separate directory, in our example I  installed it to www.flosspropopulo.com blog. The blog and wiki will need to share  the same database. As our database already exists, we will continue using the existing wiki  database. If you cannot chose a database during the installation of your blog, then you can  change the name of the database by modifying the wp-config.php file of WordPress. Visit  the site http:  codex.wordpress.org Main_Page for more help with WordPress.  [ 286 ]               Chapter 12  Time for action – install WordPress comments This first extension will allow comments from WordPress to be displayed on a MediaWiki  page. The basic use of this extension is to help ease users into using a wiki for discussion.  As most users are more familiar with blog comments than they are with a talk page, the developers created this extension to help ease users into an unfamiliar setting. Of course,  this only scratches the surface of how you can make use of this extension.  For the purpose of this demonstration, I have gone into Wordpress and created a post titled  Best software. Additionally, I created a quick comment related to the post.  To get started, we need to copy the PHP file from http:  www.gizmogarden.com  index.php Wordpress_comments_to_wikiWordpressComments.php and save it  as a file named WordpressComments.php. The code is rather long and can be downloaded  from the online companion to the book.   1. Using your FTP program or file manager, upload the WordpressComments.php  file to your extensions directory.  2. Open your LocalSettings.php file and add the following line of code:  Wordpress Comments require_once "$IP 'extensions  WordpressCommets.php"' ;  Remember, if you are using the MaintenanceShell extension, make sure to  add any new extensions, such as Wordpress Comments, above this call in  your LocalSettings.php file or when MaintenanceShell is run, these  extensions will be left out.  3.  Save your settings.  [ 287 ]               Integrating MediaWiki  Best software.  4.  Add a post to your newly-created blog. The post I created talks about a page titled   5. Open the MediaWiki page where you want the comments to appear. In this case,   we will have them appear on the Best software page.  6.  Edit the page by adding the following lines:   wp_post_title=title_of_your_comment_post wp_url=url base of your wordpress install    Change title_of_your_comment_post to the title of the blog post you created. In the example, this would be Best Software. Also, change url base of your wordpress install to the appropriate URL. For the example, the lines added would read:    wp_post_title=best_software wp_url=http:  www.flosspropopulo.com blog             [ 288 ]               Once you have edited the wiki page, you should see a comment box appear much like you would in a blog as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 12  Not only can you read comments left on the blog, but you can add comments as well. If  you do submit a comment from MediaWiki, you will be redirected back to the blog page, however, your new comment will appear on both the blog and wiki.  What just happened? In order to show a basic integration between MediaWiki and WordPress, we shared a  database between the two and uploaded a new extension to MediaWiki that allowed us   to display blog comments on a page in our wiki. We learned that not only will this extension show us comments from a blog, but we can also submit comments of our own from our  wiki page.  [ 289 ]               Integrating MediaWiki  You may ask, what can we do with this? Well, we have already discussed how this can be used as a substitute for a talk page, but we can also use it to draw attention to specific  articles in our wiki. For example, if we want to draw attention to our Best software page, we may write a blog post on it. This blog post could spark enough discussion among visitors and  drive more people to the original wiki article. WordPress users can then add directly to the  discussion without having to log out of the wiki and back into the blog.  Have a go hero While it's nice of WordPress to share the comments of certain blog posts with our wiki,  we should reciprocate by providing access to our wiki's content and sharing it with the WordPress administrator. With the popularity that blogs have, allowing articles from our wiki  to be posted on a popular blog can really do wonders for driving traffic to our wiki.   Installing the extension from http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension: WikiToWordPressCode will allow us to accomplish this with an added bonus. Included in the extension is the ability to set the $SearchString to scan newly-created articles for  specific keywords that we want to have blog postings created for.  Because this process involves creating a plugin for WordPress and configuring WordPress  files, it is being issued to you as a challenge. You can find much of what you need to get  this working from the link in the previous paragraph but it is important to note that the information for the WordPress plugin is listed under the discussion tab on the extension's page, so be sure to read that as well.  Pop quiz – WordPress Comments  1.  Where does the WordPress Comments extension pull comments from?  a. Directly from a blog's page b. c. d.  From the MediaWiki site  From the blog's database From the user's local computer  2. When the WordPress Comments extension is in use, a user that posts a comment  directly on a wiki page is redirected to the blog that is connected to the page. a.  True b.

While MediaWiki does a good job of delivering an online learning course, the real powerhouse when it comes to learning management online is Moodle.  However, what if you took a course built on Moodle and coupled it with an online textbook written in MediaWiki that also served as a collaboration repository? This could provide you  with a great platform to deliver your content.  Have a go hero To create a seamless environment between Moodle and MediaWiki, an extension called  MoodleSSO  Single sign-on  was created. This extension allows you to log in to your Moodle  course and should you be redirected to MediaWiki via a link in your course, you will already be signed on to the wiki.  The installation of this extension requires some configuration on the Moodle installation and  the code involved with it as well. As it is beyond the scope of this book, you are issued with the challenge of not only installing this extension, but configuring everything to work properly.  If you have issues when it comes to getting this to work don't fret, later in this chapter we  will learn how to integrate MediaWiki with OpenID. OpenID will let you authenticate against  Moodle as well as do what OpenID and LDAP can do for our environment.  The Single sign-on approach  One of the most frustrating things for visitors of websites is the need to register for a site  before they can read, or in MediaWiki's case edit, the content hosted on the site. Registering for another site means time spent filling out forms, another user name to remember,  another password that will probably be forgotten, and more e-mail cluttering up their  inbox with login details, forgotten passwords, and other junk.  To help alleviate some of these issues, OpenID was created to help people manage their  online identity. OpenID is an interesting tool because not only will it help you populate  ridiculously long registration forms, but sometimes, it will allow you to forego the entire  registration process as your OpenID can serve as your authentication to the site. OpenID  is a highly-touted technology as well with organizations such as VeriSign, PayPal, AOL, and  Yahoo! making use of this service for their visitors and clients.

Nowadays, you can sign up for a service such as PBWikis.com and they will host a ready-made wiki for you for free. While this may be  a great solution for someone who wants to host a small wiki for a few family members or  friends to collaborate and share information on, for building a large scale wiki site, it just  won't do.  Much of the problems with the smaller wiki applications lie in their limitations. They don't  allow for much customization; in most cases, what you see is what you get.  Conversely, MediaWiki takes a different approach. Being a free open source application,  you are encouraged to customize your wiki to make it work best for you. This is why the  developers spend so much time creating extensions.  Extensions are a great concept because they allow you, the site designer, to pick and choose what additional functionality you want for your wiki. While it may have been easier if the  MediaWiki team had just included all of these extensions into the base installation, this would  be extremely taxing on the server's resources and would limit who could install MediaWiki.  Throughout the book, you have installed many different extensions so you know just how  easy it is to do this. In this appendix, we are going to look at some of the best extensions available to you. None of the extensions included here are ones we have already installed.            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  Of course, you may be looking for other extensions as well. As there are over 1000 extensions available to you, we can only list the ones I think are the best. If you wish to view an entire list,  you can do so by visiting   http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Category:Extensions_by_category.  Administration  These extensions all help make your job as the sysop easier.  AbsenteeLandlord Planning a vacation where you can't keep up with changes to your wiki? This extension  helps prevent inactive wikis from becoming the targets of spambots and vandalism by  automatically locking the wiki database if a sysop has not logged in during a time period  defined by $wgAbsenteeLandlordMaxDays. With the database locked, no further changes can be made to the wiki. To unlock the wiki database, and the wiki itself, the sysop needs to  simply log in to the wiki. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AbsenteeLandlord  [ 298 ]            AbuseFilter Installing this extension creates a special page named AbuseFilter where privileged users can set controls to the user activity on the wiki. These users can also define how the wiki reacts  to certain behaviors.  Appendix A  This extension requires the AntiSpoof extension to be installed as well.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AbuseFilter  AccessControl This extension is used to restrict access to specific pages based on a user's group. After  installing this extension, you can control both the viewing and editing of a page. This  extension also allows you to grant access to multiple user groups. You can also block access  to read certain pages by group or individual users.  Users who have been forbidden to view a page cannot use the search feature to view protected pages.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AccessControl  TitleBlacklist This extension allows the administrator to create blacklists for page titles and usernames  that they deem inappropriate.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:TitleBlacklist  BrokenLinks This extension is meant for smaller wikis. What it does is collect URLs from a table named  Manual: Externallinks_table and check each URL for a successful server response. Any links that have a failed response are reported to you on a special page named BrokenLinks. This  report also tells you about the page on which this broken link appears.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:BrokenLinks  Google Analytics Using this extension places a Google Analytics tracking code into each page on the wiki. To  keep the statistics more honest, users with bot privileges and sysops are not counted in the  statistics. You have the option of keeping logged in users out of the statistical counts as well.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Google_Analytics_Integration  [ 299 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  ImportUsers If you are in charge of implementing a wiki for an organization with multiple users, you  would normally have two options when it comes to creating users. First, you could let the  users create their accounts individually. While this takes the workload off of you, and any  other administrator, it is a given that some of your users will not follow your directions when  it comes to creating appropriate user names, using strong passwords, or entering the correct  e-mail address. The second option alleviates any issues with inappropriate registrations  because it requires you and your fellow administrators, if you have any, to create each account yourself.  The ImportUsers extension gives you the best of both worlds. If you can get all of your users  into a spreadsheet, or other file that can be saved as a CSV, then you can easily import the  list right to the wiki's database through a special page called ImportUsers. Not only will this save you time, but you can be sure that the accounts will reflect exactly what you want.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:ImportUsers  MaintenanceShell We saw MaintenanceShell in action in Chapter 11. This extension gives the sysop access to the  wiki's maintenance scripts if they don't have access to the command line of their web server.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:MaintenanceShell  ManageCategories For the beginner MediaWiki user, categories may seem a bit intimidating. This extension al- lows you to easily define what category you want an article to be a part of and even define  new ones if needed.  ManageCategories extends the edit area of the page to include three new parts:   A menu box where you can choose from all current categories  A text field to assign the article to a new category  Checkboxes that represents the currently assigned categories  optional   http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:ManageCategories  [ 300 ]            Appendix A  StalkerLog This extension can be a great help if you need to keep track of user activity on your wiki.  StalkerLog creates a log of user logins and logouts. By default, anyone can view this log but by customizing the permissions, you can set it up so that only certain groups or users have access to the logs.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:StalkerLog  UserLoginLog In Chapter 8 we saw UserLoginLog in action. This extension displays the IP address of users  who logged in, or attempted to log in, and displays them on the special page Special:Logs.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:UserLoginLog  UserRightsList Managing user rights in MediaWiki can be a bit of a chore. Granting extra permissions means  you have to search for the user by name and then add the permissions. To make this job a  bit easier, you can install the extension, UserRightsList. This extension creates a special page  that lists all of the users registered with the wiki. With a simple checkbox, you can grant or revoke additional privileges to your users.  This extension also comes with a filtering system so you can search by group or username  and even employ SQL wildcards.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:UserRightsList  Content  The following extensions were designed to provide alternate ways to display content and to  help make contributing easier on your authors.  PdfBook For large wikis, your categories may be loaded with content that you wish to share via a print medium or digital reader. This is where the PdfBook extension can come in handy.  This extension extracts your articles from your wiki and creates a PDF file out of it. Each  article takes the role of a new chapter and the extension even creates a table of contents for  your newly-created book.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Pdf_Book  [ 301 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  Cite When writing, it is common to use outside sources to support your work. However, it is also  necessary to cite these sources when you use them.  Cite is an extension that allows you to create footnotes so your visitors can provide credit to anyone else's work they use when writing articles for your wiki.   There are multiple files that need to be installed to get this extension working. If you are  installing Cite.php on an older version of MediaWiki, you may have issues with HTML  parameters and parser functions. However, Cite is in use by Wikipedia so it is considered a  stable extension. When used with versions after 1.11, there have been no reported issues.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Cite  DocumentApproval If you are using MediaWiki in a corporate or educational environment, there is most likely  going to be content that requires the approval of someone else before it is posted. After all,  the HR department doesn't want Joe in accounting declaring every Friday to be Hawaiian  Shirt day without approval!  The DocumentApproval extension allows the article's author to insert a tag that creates  a Sign tab to be displayed. The appropriate user can then use this to approve or sign the  document certifying its accuracy.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:DocumentApproval  EditOwn Need to protect pages against edits from your visitors? The EditOwn extension provides  security against any user, other than privileged users, editing a page created by someone  else. Users can make any changes to pages they create, but the collaboration benefit of  MediaWiki is no longer in place. This can be a good extension to use if you are creating your  website with MediaWiki or for an online textbook.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:EditOwn  EmbedPDF Installing the EmbedPDF extension provides you with the   and   tags. Placing the name of an uploaded PDF file or a link to a PDF file hosted elsewhere will create a  700pixel by 600pixel box on the page to display the PDF referred to. Remember, if you are going to host PDF files on your server, you need to tell MediaWiki to allow their uploads.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:EmbedPDF  [ 302 ]            Appendix A  EmbedVideoPlus Earlier we saw how we can embed Flash files into our wiki. The EmbedVideoPlus extension  allows us to embed videos from popular video sharing sites such as YouTube. The extension  doesn't limit your control of how your videos are displayed. You have the option to define  parameters such as alignment, width, and height.  This extension does not require you to upload videos to your server. Instead, you define the  service and provide the ID of the video and EmbedVideoPlus goes out to the server and pulls the video for you.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:EmbedVideoPlus  Flash This is another extension we saw in action back in Chapter 6 when we learned how to embed  Flash movies into our wiki. Flash extensions can leave your wiki vulnerable to a cross site scripting exploit, so use these extensions carefully.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Flash  Google Calendar Quite simply, this extension allows you display a Google Calendar right in your wiki. A  separate site from Google, https:  www.google.com calendar embedhelper, allows you to configure how the calendar is displayed.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Google_Calendar  Google Maps Just like Google Calendar, you can embed Google Maps into your wiki with this extension. Think of what you can do with articles about different locations! This extension also allows  you to add a make a map link that, when clicked, opens the maps editor.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Google_Maps  [ 303 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  GoogleWave Want the ultimate in collaboration? How about a marriage of MediaWiki and Google Wave?  Google Wave has been called the reinvention of e-mail that allows users to create live, social  communication documents that can be edited by multiple users in near real-time. This  extension provides just that by allowing you to embed Google Waves right into your wiki us- ing the newly-created   tag. While the ID of the wave is required, there are other  parameters you can define as well:   height  width  color  bgcolor   font  fontsize  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:GoogleWave  Collection Earlier, we saw how to embed PDF files into your wiki. However, what if you wanted to  create a PDF file from an article in your wiki? Rather than printing the page with a PDF  creator, install this extension so any of your visitors have the option of turning a page into  a PDF file. Don't want a PDF file but you would rather have the page in OpenDocument  format? Maybe DocBook XML is the desired output? No problem, the Collection extension  allows for any of these formats.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Collection  OggHandler Like the Flash extension, we saw OggHandler back in Chapter 6 to embed Ogg audio and video files into our wiki.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:OggHandler  User  Whether you need to keep a closer watch over your wiki's users or you need to raise their privileges, these extensions were built to help manage all things related to the user.  [ 304 ]            Appendix A  ConfirmAccount While allowing anyone to create an account may be the nice way to go, sometimes, you  may want to limit who has access to your wiki. The ConfirmAccount extension makes it so  that any accounts created need to be approved by the sysop bureaucrat accounts before  they are activated.  This extension has quite a few configuration options available to you, from determining the  minimum word count for a user's biography to how long an inactive account can exist before  it is automatically rejected.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:ConfirmAccount  EditOnlyYourOwnPage If the EditOwn extension gives your users too much freedom, then EditOnlyYourOwnPage is the extension for you. With this installed, users can only edit their user page, talk page, and subpages of them. That's it.  Of course, your sysop isn't prevented from editing pages.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:EditOnlyYourOwnPage  SocialRewarding Everyone likes to be recognized. So if you are not one of those wikis with EditOnlyYourOwnPage installed, you may want to bring attention to those users who  contribute quality content to your wiki.  This extension comes with a great piece of documentation that explains how to use the four  reward techniques:   Amount of References  Most Viewed Articles  Rating of Articles  Recommender System  Communication  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:SocialRewarding  Wikis are all about communication and collaboration. These extensions help enhance the  communication functionality of your wiki.  [ 305 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  AIM The AIM extension provides a tag,   and  , that displays a button with the user's  AOL Instant Messenger status  the AIM username is placed between the tags . Clicking on the button opens an AIM chat window as a pop up.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AIM  ContactPage The ContactPage extension creates a special page, called Contact, that allows visitors to contact the sysop via a form. While it is similar to Emailuser special page, the Contact extension allows for anonymous submissions. Captcha can be enabled in this extension to prevent spam. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:ContactPage  ICQ Just like the AIM extension, ICQ allows you to place your ICQ number between the   and   tags. When this is placed on a page, a button with the user's ICQ status is shown. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:ICQ  IRC Chat Unlike the AIM and ICQ extensions, this one is rather complex as it requires you to modify  the database through phpMyAdmin, and make adjustments to the skin. Once you have all  of the configurations out of the way you will be happy with the results because now, you  can open Internet Relay Chat  IRC  right in your MediaWiki interface using PJIRC.  Something like this can be great for a developer wiki, a MMORPG wiki, or a wiki that coincides with a popular IRC topic.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:IRC_Chat  QPoll Want to include multiple polls on your wiki pages? Or maybe you want to chain a few polls  together. In either case, the QPoll extension gives you many more features than the Poll  extension.  Installing the extension is not complicated, but setting up the polls requires a great deal of  reading. If you are looking for something easy, try the Poll extension. If you want robust polls and don't mind the extra work, stick with QPoll. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:QPoll  [ 306 ]            Appendix A  Skype AIM and ICQ have extensions so why should Skype users be left out? With this extension,  you can include your Skype username between the   and    tags to show your online status to wiki visitors.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Skype  WebChat Want to enable chat in your wiki without having to use the complex IRC Chat extension? If so, look no further. This extension creates a special page named WebChat. Visitors can navigate to the page and chat with other wiki users.  This is great if you wish to keep your chat internal, for instance at a work place or school.  Keep in mind though, this does not create a chat room on your wiki itself, rather it sets up the client to connect to the freenode IRC server on channel freenode.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:WebChat  Discussion The Discussion extension lets you place a discussion panel on articles in your wiki with just a  small bit of wikitext. The discussion panel mimics that of a blog's comment box. Check back  in Chapter 9 to refresh your memory about how this extension looks.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Discussion  Security  Protect your content and data from spam and vandalism with extensions designed to help better secure your wiki.   AuthorProtect In the EditOwn extension, the sysop made the decision that only authors could edit their own work. AuthorProtect leaves this decision in the hands of the individual authors. They  can choose to protect a page that they create by blocking everyone but themselves and the sysop from editing the page, or they can leave the page alone and let any user make edits.  The option to protect a page is done on a page-by-page basis. Installing this extension does  not protect every page on the wiki by default.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AuthorProtect  [ 307 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  Check Spambots When it comes to bots spamming your wiki, you can never be too safe. CheckSpambots  is an extension that checks the IP address of an editor, their e-mail address, and name against databases that list known spammers. The blacklists are all hosted on external servers  and include:   FSpamlist - fspamlist.com  Stop Forum Spam - stopforumspam.com  SORBS - sorbs.net  Spamhaus - spamhaus.org  SpamCop - spamcop.net  Project Honey Pot - projecthoneypot.org  BotScout - botscout.com  DroneBL - dronebl.org  AHBL - ahbl.org  Undisposable - undisposable.net  Tor Project - torproject.org  This extension does not check the body of the edit and does not check external links to see if they are spam. Other considerations include the fact that there is no whitelist so every edit is checked against these external servers. Because these servers are hosted elsewhere, the edit process will be noticeably slower.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Check_Spambots  EnforceStrongPassword More and more IT departments are requiring users to have strong passwords for their accounts  as a way to protect against brute force attacks. This extension, EnforceStrongPassword, allows  the sysop to define minimum password requirements for all users.  If you have users already registered for your wiki, notify them of the requirements. Once  the extension is installed, they will not be able to log in if their password does not meet the minimum requirements.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:EnforceStrongPassword  [ 308 ]            PasswordProtectPages If the author wishes to protect specific pages using a password, for both viewing and editing,  then this extension should be installed. PasswordProtectPages creates a protect link on  the page that redirects the author to a page to set up the page password. After doing this,  anyone wanting to read or edit this page has to unlock it using the predetermined password.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:PasswordProtectPages  Appendix A  Bad Behavior We saw Bad Behavior in Chapter 8 when we learned how to keep spam comments. This  extension not only helps prevent spam, but it will help keep e-mail harvesters from stealing e-mail addresses from your wiki.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Bad_Behavior  Monetization  Is it in your plans to make money from your wiki? If so, these monetization extensions will  help get you on your way.  AmazonAssociates With the AmazonAssociates extension, you display Amazon books on your wiki using Amazon  Web Services  AWS  and an Amazon Associates account. When a visitor clicks on a link to make a purchase, the account associated will be credited with a percentage of the sale.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AmazonAssociates  Google Adsense & Google Adsense2 Have an AdSense account with Google? Using these two extensions you can include AdSense ads across the top of the wiki, using Google Adsense, and in the sidebar, using Google Adsense2.  This is the easiest solution for monetizing your wiki, however, it does require you  to set up an Adsense account with Google before installing this extension.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Google_Adsense  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Google_AdSense_2  [ 309 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  PayPal If you plan on selling anything through your wiki, such as an e-book, a subscription, or  even a donation, the PayPal extension will give you the means to collect money from your  customers. Originally written in German, a few modifications to display information in  English and all you have to do is use the   and   tags to create a button  and text description for Paypal. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:PayPal  Cool  These extensions were just too cool to leave out of the list.  AnyWikiDraw While there are some security considerations related to the enabling of cookies and  JavaScript in order to get this extension to work, it is really a cool addition to your site.  AnyWikiDraw runs a Java applet in your wiki that allows the editing of SVG, PNG, and JPEG  images directly in the wiki. For sites where kids are a primary audience, this extension can be a great addition. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:AnyWikiDraw  Balloons Tooltips are a great way to teach people how to do something. For educational wikis, or wikis that attract a great deal of new users, the addition of tooltips can really give  your wiki some pop.  The Balloons extension provides the magic tag   that allows you to add pop up tooltips to images and text in your wiki.  http:  mckay.cshl.edu wiki index.php MediaWiki_Balloon_Extension  CSS MenuSidebar Wikis don't have to be boring. With the CSS MenuSidebar extension you can jazz up your site a bit with some CSS. You can create additional sidebar elements as a menu  with dropdown items.  Along with the extension, you will need to copy a CSS file to your server as well so you can  style your menus. http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:CSS_MenuSidebar  [ 310 ]            Appendix A  CategoryCloud Category clouds are extremely popular on blogs thanks to a simple plugin made available from WordPress. With MediaWiki, an extension called CategoryCloud creates a tag cloud for every subcategory in the category.  Each word can be resized based on the number of children, both category and articles, in  each subcategory.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:CategoryCloud  Flickr Wikis are all about collaboration and sharing, so why not share your Flickr images with your  wiki's audience.  Using the Flickr extension has some advantages over uploading and embedding files. First,  you don't have to store them on your server so resources such as storage and bandwidth aren't being used.  Second, you can keep the comments from Flickr so that they can be shared as well.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:Flickr  MediaWikiPlayer We saw earlier in the book how to playback Flash and Ogg files with separate players. The  MediaWikiPlayer encompasses many different file types and allows you to play them back  over your wiki.  By adding the URL of the file between two tags,   and  , you can play the following file types:   FLV  MP4  H264 AAC   MP3  Youtube  Various streaming servers  Various XML playlists  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:MediawikiPlayer  [ 311 ]            The Best Extensions for MediaWiki  SendToTwitter Want to send a tweet when you wiki is updated? SendToTwitter is an extension that will do  just that. You can customize your message and the extension will automatically shorten the  URL for you.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Extension:SendToTwitter  More on extensions  You can find out more about MediaWiki extensions from the Category: Extensions page at: http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Category: Extensions. You will find links to the  extension matrix that lists every possible extension for MediaWiki, information on how to  request an extension, and how you can contribute your own extensions to MediaWiki.  [ 312 ]            B  The Best of MediaWiki in Use  Throughout this book, we have seen some pretty good examples of how MediaWiki is  used to power a wiki solution for many sites. Specifically, we have seen how Wikipedia and  Joomla! use this software quite successfully.  Over the next few pages, we will see some other examples of MediaWIki in use to give you some ideas as to what MediaWiki can do.  Collaboration  Remember how back in Chapter 1 we introduced you to the early days of the wiki? It was used as a collaboration tool for programmers, right? Well, Facebook developers have created a wiki  of their own to help other developers write and share applications for the Facebook platform.   http:  wiki.developers.facebook.com index.php Main_Page            The Best of MediaWiki in Use  The following screenshot shows the Main Page of this wiki:  [ 314 ]            Appendix B  Support  The University of South Florida's Information Technology department created this site to  help students access, use, and troubleshoot technology issues around campus. This helps  provide quick answers to simple questions so students can find what they need without  having to assign someone from the support team to answer the question.  http:  wiki.it.usf.edu index.php Main_Page  [ 315 ]            The Best of MediaWiki in Use  Project management  Because of a wiki's collaborative nature, building a site to coordinate projects is an excellent  use of MediaWiki's capabilities. Mozilla Wiki is a perfect example of this. On their site, they  list the project schedule, roadmaps, and even meeting information for different sub-projects.  https:  wiki.mozilla.org   [ 316 ]            Online learning  Dedicated to biological research and engineering, OpenWetWare also allows professors to upload their courses to this online educational portal. Those interested can view courses  from MIT, University of California, Berkley, the Imperial College London, and many others.  http:  openwetware.org wiki Main_Page  Appendix B  In addition to being a great example of an online learning community, OpenWetWare is a  great example of what you can do when customizing an existing MediaWiki skin!  [ 317 ]            The Best of MediaWiki in Use  The complete site  There are few sites that make use of everything MediaWiki has to offer, and no one makes  use of this software better than the Open Web Application Security Project  OWASP . They  have updates on their various projects, a mass collection of tutorials, user manuals, articles,  and much more. For an example of what you can really do with MediaWiki, this is the best place to visit.  http:  www.owasp.org  [ 318 ]            C  Where to Turn to  While I hope you find the information in this book extremely helpful, there are times when  you will need to look elsewhere for help. Maybe you need help with moving your wiki, or your extension just won't work right. Whatever the case may be, know that as one of the largest open source projects, MediaWiki has a cadre of community members who are more than willing to help you with any issue you may have.  Before we look at some of the sites where you can turn to, understand that when dealing with online support you are turning to other people who have jobs, families, and other activities in their lives. While it can be frustrating to post a question and have to wait for a  response, the people answering your questions are not being paid to do so. They are helping  you and it is important to treat them as such.  Another point to remember is that it is up to you to do your research before asking a question. Look through the different support forums and websites to see if anyone else has  had the same issue. Extension not working? Check the discussion page to see if there is any information there. The point is, do your research, don't expect someone else to do it for you.  Official MediaWiki support  The developers of MediaWiki have put together a few avenues for users to find help and  support on a variety of different issues. Many people may opt for these as a first choice as all  fixes are approved by MediaWiki developers. However, even MediaWiki suggests looking to  other forums for help as well.  Project:Support desk The Support desk special page was built for users to post questions regarding MediaWiki.  There is a warning here that questions may take several days to be answered, and there is a  chance they will not be answered at all.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Project:Support_desk            Where to Turn to  Chat Made up of volunteers, this is the real-time support channel for MediaWIki. If you are in  need of immediate support, this is the best place as you can chat with someone regarding your problem. It is important to note some specific rules regarding the IRC channel:   Check the FAQ page and the Manual before asking your question.  Post your question and wait for a response. Don't ask, "Is anyone there?" If you are   not receiving a response it may because:  There are no volunteers on at that time. Come back later and  try again   No one has an answer to your problem  The question you are asking can be found in the Manual or on the  FAQ page       Expect to wait before getting an initial response. You may need to provide more   information, so have this ready as well.  You can use the mediawiki IRC channel.  irc:  irc.freenode.net mediawiki  Help:Contents This is the User help page that covers topics from editing a page to how to block a range of IP  addresses. In addition to the page that was created for each topic, you can find a great deal  of information in the discussion page as well. All of these pages are considered to be in the  public domain so do not post anything that you may wish to keep a copyright on.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Help:Contents  Manual:FAQ Just as the title suggests, this is the frequently asked questions  FAQ  page for MediaWiki. While a great deal of questions are answered here, you can also look to the old Meta wiki  FAQ page found at: http:  meta.wikimedia.org wiki MediaWiki_FAQ.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Manual:FAQ  Manual:Contents This is the official technical manual for MediaWiki. The manual is broken into three sections,  one for users, another for system administrators, and a third for developers. Like other pages, the discussion tab holds as much important information as the article itself.  [ 320 ]            Appendix C  If you feel you are ready to help out with the MediaWiki project, you may be able to contribute to the manual by checking out the to do list.  http:  www.mediawiki.org wiki Manual:Contents  Mailing list                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      [ 321 ]            Where to Turn to  SiteGround SiteGround is actually a web hosting company that provides MediaWiki as one of their  supported applications. To help their customers, they have created a series of knowledge  base articles and tutorials regarding MediaWiki. These tutorials cover some of the basics  and don't get into some of the more complicated issues you may face, however they are  a nice starting point.  http:  kb.siteground.com category MediaWiki_issues.html  [ 322 ]            D  Pop Quiz Answers  Chapter 2  MediaWiki requirements quiz  Chapter 3  the navigation box  the toolbox  2   a   2   a   2   b   1   c   1   b   1   b   3  d  3  c  3   d   4  b            4  d  4  a  4  b  1   a   1   a   1   a   1  b   2   a   2   b   2   c   2  b   Pop Quiz Answers  the body  Chapter 4  creating pages  Chapter 5  tables    Chapter 6  multimedia  Chapter 7  namespaces 1  b   2  c   3   b   3   d   3   a   3 a  3 c  [ 324 ]            Appendix D  4  b  4  a   4  a   5 d  5 b  Chapter 8  user groups  Chapter 9  Recent changes   edits  Chapter 10  understanding blocks  Chapter 11  backup and restore   1   b   1  b   1  a   1  c   1  a   2   c   2  a   2  b   2  b   2  a   3   a   3  d   3  c   3 d  3 d  [ 325 ]            WordPress Comments  Pop Quiz Answers  Chapter 12  1  b   1  d   AuthJoomla  2 a  2 a  [ 326 ]            Index  Symbols __FORCETOC__ magic words  131 __HIDDENCAT__ magic words  131 __INDEX__ magic words  131    tag  129  __NEWSECTIONLINK__ magic words  131 __NOCC__ magic words  131 __NOCONTENTCONVERT__ magic words  131 __NOEDITSECTION__ magic words  131 __NOGALLERY__ magic words  131 __NOINDEX__ magic words  131 __NONEWSECTIONLINK__ magic words  131 __NOTITLECONVERT__ magic words  131 __NOTOC__ magic words  131 __STATICREDIRECT__ magic words  131 __TOC__ magic words  131  MaintenanceShell  300 ManageCategories  300 StalkerLog  301 TitleBlacklist  299 UserLoginLog  301 UserRightsList  301 administration, user  about  207  administrative tools  218  changes, reverting  215  changes, reverting back  215  edit history  207  page history  207  page history, viewing  208, 209  page, reverting back  214  pages, watching  213, 214  previous content, reverting back  216, 217  administrative tools  edit summaries  218  minor changes  219, 220  minor changes, dummy edit  220 minor changes, null edit  220  Adobe Flash  146 AIM extension  306 allowed file types  editing, for uploading  187  AmazonAssociates extension  309 anchor links  104  creating  105-107  anchors.

MediaWiki is the free, open-source wiki engine software that powers Wikipedia and many of the other popular wikis across the Web. Written in PHP, it possesses many features that make it the engine of choice for large collaborative wikis: flexible markup, comprehensive user management, multimedia handling, and more. Whether you are creating a public wiki for open contributions, a private wiki for collaborating within your work team or group of friends, or even a wiki for personal use, this book will provide you with all the essential steps you require to achieve this. This book covers how to administer users, back up and restore content safely, migrate your installation to another server or database, and even make hacks to the code. From the installation process to customizing the pages, you will learn what it takes to run a well designed, secure MediaWiki site. Throughout the course of this book, you will see the many different ways that MediaWiki can be used on the Web. This book covers the open source MediaWiki wiki engine from installation and getting started through structuring your collaborative web site, advanced formatting, images, and multimedia to migrating your installation and creating new MediWiki templates. While you will be introduced to the many uses of a wiki, you will also be taken through step-by-step exercises that will help you master the many administrative tasks associated with running and securing your wiki. You will learn how to prevent unauthorized edits being made to content, how to prevent spam, how to back up and restore your wiki, how to configure its look and functionality to suit your needs, and much more
