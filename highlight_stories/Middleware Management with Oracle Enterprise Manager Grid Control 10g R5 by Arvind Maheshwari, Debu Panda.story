Oracle Fusion Middleware  is the number one middleware in the market with over 90,000 customers.  Enterprise Manager provides an integrated management solution for Oracle Fusion  Middleware. It is a complete management solution for the Oracle stack, which  includes Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Database, Oracle Enterprise Linux,  Oracle VM, and packaged applications such as Oracle eBusiness Suite, Siebel   CRM, and PeopleSoft. It also leverages the built-in management capabilities in the  Oracle stack to provide an integrated and end-to-end management solution for the  Oracle eco-system.  In a typical datacenter, there are multiple Middleware platforms. Monitoring,  application performance management, configuration management, and life cycle  operations of diverse middleware platforms is very expensive. Most of the new JEE  applications are composite applications built with multi-tiered architecture and  hence management of such applications needs specialized tools. As Information  Technology becomes the core to the success of any business, there is a greater need  of business-IT alignment. This book will show you how Enterprise Manager from  Oracle meets these new challenges in the data center and can help reduce the total  cost of ownership as well allow IT to contribute to a greater business success. Enterprise Manager Grid Control 10g R5 was released in March 2009. This version  of Enterprise manager provides management capability for Oracle and non-Oracle  middleware platform that includes Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Application  Server, Oracle Coherence, Oracle SOA Suite, IBM Web Sphere, and JBoss Application  Server, and many more. This book will help you understand how Enterprise  Manager Grid Control provides for better business-IT alignment and allows IT   to not just manage middleware but also manage business processes implemented  using SOA architecture.

He picks it up with hesitation.  He gets a text message from an automated system, telling him that there are  serious issues in the applications that he supports, and users in Australia are facing  problems as well. Rob is an administrator for middleware applications. He opens his  laptop and starts looking at the issue. After hours of investigation he finds that the  external web service their application depends on is not responding.   This might sound familiar. It's typical in the life of many of today's administrators.  Welcome to the world of middleware management, where life starts with service  violations and ends with the diagnostics of performance issues.  Most modern applications have become global, and run 24X7 and if you are a  middleware administrator then probably your work has become 24X7 too. Today's  applications are very complex and depend on several components that you, as an  administrator, do not have control over. But you have the responsibility to make sure  that the application meets availability and performance criteria. You probably want  to avoid situations like Rob's and do away with sleepless nights. You probably want  to be proactive and implement the right tools and methodologies so that you can  avoid many of the interruptions to your applications.   Throughout this book, we will discuss how you can use Oracle Enterprise   Manager to proactively monitor your middleware applications and the   underlying infrastructure.  Before we do that, let us first drill down and examine the various complexities in   modern applications.   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Preface  Complexities in modern applications Modern day applications are way more complex than predecessors such as   client-server or mainframe applications. Technologies such as the Internet, Java  Enterprise Edition  Java EE  and Service Oriented Architecture  SOA  have  revolutionized the way that applications are built and integrated. They are multi-tier  and run on heterogeneous platforms. They depend upon several resources within  and outside of organizations. Today's resources may include an application running  on a mainframe system, or an ERP system, or resources made available by a partner  through the Internet, intranet, or extranet. As an administrator, you may not have  control over these resources, or applications—however, you are responsible for   their performance.  Some of the typical characteristics of modern applications are:   	 Deployed on an application server or middleware  	 Depends on databases and messaging providers      May depend on applications running on mainframe systems or    legacy systems   	 May depend on external services available over the internet or extranet  	 May depend upon complex and long running business processes    May have complex routing or workflow requirements   	 May depend on a clustered caching service for faster data access  Also, today's applications have complex requirements with associated and specific  requirements such as:   	 Availability  	 Service Level  	 Compliance and security   If you are a middleware administrator, you know that you have a lot of things to do!  You have to wear several hats from time to time.  [ 2 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Preface  Middleware administrator—a man with  several hats  Unlike a database administrator or UNIX system administrator—a middleware  administrator has to be knowledgeable in several areas and perform a lot of tasks to  keep applications up and available. You have to know how the application works  and understand its dependencies. The most trivial applications have database access,  and hence you must be proficient in database technologies such as JDBC and SQL.  You have to understand messaging systems and key technologies such as various  web services and Service Oriented Architecture  SOA . Most applications employ  different security mechanisms, such as using an LDAP Server, thus you have to  know the basics of security infrastructure.  With modern application complexities, you have to be agile and you need the right  sets of tools and practices.   If you are a middleware administrator then you know how your life goes! Some of  the typical tasks that middleware administrators perform are as follows:     Monitors performance of production environment middleware and   associated applications     Diagnoses production issues    Plans for production deployment    Installs provisions software  	 Tracks and applies patches    Performs trend analysis and capacity planning for future growth    Brings into compliance standards such as the Information Technology   Infrastructure Library  ITIL   You may ask the question—how do you juggle between these tasks? What is the  optimal ratio of these tasks? There are no right answers here. This is actually based  on your organization. We have seen administrators just struggling to keep up with  monitoring the production middleware platform and making it highly available.  This typically happens if you do not use the right tools and practices. Administrators  spend most of their morning running several scripts to verify the health of their  middleware platform. If you spend your entire morning checking the health of your  middleware platform, then it is highly unlikely that you will be able to perform all of  your tasks in your eight hour daily job!

In some organizations, the database administrators or  developers take on additional responsibilities for middleware administration. If you  are part of such an organization then it is really challenging for you to perform all  aspects of middleware management without the appropriate management tools.  Key challenges faced by administrators To compete, organizations are trying to keep their costs low. This is putting greater  burdens on the IT infrastructure, which must remain agile to make the company's  applications highly available. As a middleware administrator, you have more  responsibilities and less resources for keeping your infrastructure running and  maintaining the service levels of your applications. Middleware administrators,  in particular, are faced with a number of challenges that come with managing a  complex application architecture. Some of the key challenges are:      Inability to manage multiple installs of a middleware package from a  single management console     Lack of visibility to other tiers in the applications    Managing application performance to meet service levels and application   diagnostics     Compliance to standard practices such as Information Technology   Infrastructure Library  ITIL   To cope with these challenges, you have to choose the right management tools  to manage your middleware infrastructure. There are several tools available in  the marketplace. However, if you are using Oracle Fusion Middleware; Oracle  Enterprise Manager is the right choice to manage your complete application  infrastructure. Oracle Enterprise Manager not only provides great tools to manage  your Oracle databases but it also provides comprehensive functionalities to manage  your middleware infrastructure and enterprise applications.  Throughout this book, we will provide an insight on how to manage applications  running on Oracle Fusion Middleware and third-party application servers.

One can see different types of hardware, operating systems, databases,  middleware, integration servers, storage devices, and networking devices in any such  data center. Such diversity of technologies and operating systems can be attributed to  many factors, and some of them are:              Evolution of IT systems: As architectural patterns moved from monolithic  systems to distributed systems, not all IT systems were moved to the newest  patterns. Some new systems were built with new technologies and patterns  whereas existing systems that were performing well enough continued on  earlier technologies. Best of breed approach: With multi-tiered architectures, enterprises had the  choice of building each tier using best of breed technology for that tier. For  example, one system could be built using a J2EE container from vendor A,  but a database from vendor B. Avoiding single vendors and technologies: Enterprises wanted to avoid  dependence on any single vendor and technology. This led to systems being  built using different technologies. For example, an order-booking system  built using .NET technologies on Windows servers, but an order shipment  system built using J2EE platform on Linux servers. Acquisitions and Mergers: Through acquisitions and mergers, enterprises  have inherited IT systems that were built using different technologies.  Frequently, new systems were added to integrate the systems of two  enterprises but the new systems were totally different from the existing  systems. For example, using BPEL process manager to integrate a CRM  system with a transportation management system.

At the same time, such diversity makes management of the data  center more complex. To manage such data centers we need a special product like  Oracle's Enterprise Manager Grid Control that can provide a unified and centralized  management solution for the wide array of products.  In any given data center, there are lots of repetitive operations that need to be  executed on multiple servers  like applying security patches on all Oracle Databases .  As data centers move away from high-end servers to a grid of inexpensive servers,  the number of IT resources increases in the data center and so does the cost of  executing repetitive operations on the grid. Enterprise Manager Grid Control  provides solutions to reduce the cost of any grid by automating repetitive operations  that can be simultaneously executed on multiple servers. Enterprise Manager Grid  Control works as a force multiplier by providing support for executing the same  operations on multiple servers at the cost of one operation.  As organizations put more emphasis on business and IT alignment, that requires a  view of IT resources overlaid with business processes and applications is required.  Enterprise Manager Grid Control provides such a view and improves the visibility of  IT and business processes in a given data center. By using Enterprise Manager Grid  Control, administrators can see IT issues in the context of business processes and  they can understand how business processes are affected by IT performance.   In this chapter, we will get to know more about Oracle's Enterprise Manager Grid  Control by covering the following aspects:     Key features of Enterprise Manager Grid Control:                         Comprehensive view of data center Unmanned monitoring Historical data analysis Configuration management Managing multiple entities as one Service level management Scheduling Automating provisioning Information publishing Synthetic transaction Manage from anywhere     Enterprise Manager Product family  [ 12 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 1  Range of products managed by Enterprise Manager:  Enterprise Manager Grid Control architecture.                    Range of products EM extensibility  Multi-tier architecture Major components High availability     Summary of learning  Key features of Enterprise Manager   Grid Control Typical applications in today's world are built with multi-tiered architecture; to  manage such applications a system administrator has to navigate through multiple  management tools and consoles that come along with each product. Some of the  tools have a browser interface, some have a thick client interface, or even a command  line interface. Navigating through multiple management tools often involves doing  some actions from a browser or running some scripts or launching a thick client from  the command line.    For example, to find bottlenecks in a J2EE application in the production environment,  an administrator has to navigate through the management console for the HTTP  server, the management console for the J2EE container, and the management   console for the database.  Enterprise Manager Grid Control is a systems management product for the  monitoring and management of all of the products in the data center. For the  scenario explained above, Enterprise Manager provides a common management  interface to manage an HTTP server, J2EE server and database. Enterprise Manager  provides this unified solution for all products in a data center.  In addition to basic monitoring, Enterprise Manager provides a unified interface   for many other administration tasks like patching, configuration compliance,  backup-recovery, and so on.  Some key features of Enterprise Manager are explained here.

As the  number of all such resources is very high, this Enterprise Manager highlights the  resources that need immediate attention or that may need attention in near future.  For example, a critical security patch is available that needs to be applied on some  Fusion Middleware servers, or a server that has 90% CPU utilization.  The following figure shows one such view of a data center, where users can see all  entities that are monitored, that are up, that are down, that have performance alerts,  that have configuration violations and so on. The user can drill down to fine-grained  views from this top-level view.  The data in the top-level view and the fine-grained drill-down view can be broadly  summarized in the following categories:  [ 14 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 1  Performance data Data that shows how an IT resource is performing, that includes the current status,  overall availability over a period of time, and other performance indicators that  are specific to the resource like the average response time for a J2EE server. Any  violation of acceptable performance thresholds is highlighted in this view.  Configuration data Configuration data is the configuration parameters or, configuration files captured  from an IT resource. Besides the current configuration, changes in configuration are  also tracked and available from Enterprise Manager. Any violation of configuration  conformance is also available. For example, if a data center policy mandates that only  port 80 should be open on all servers, Enterprise Manager captures any violation of  that policy.  Status of scheduled operations  In any data center there are some scheduled operations, these operations could be  something like a system administration task such as taking a backup of a database  server or some batch process that moves data across systems, for example, moving  orders from fulfillment to shipping. Enterprise Manager provides a consolidated   view of the status of all such scheduled operations.   Inventory  Enterprise Manager provides a listing of all hardware and software resources  with details like version numbers. All of these resources are also categorized in  different buckets – for example, Oracle Application Server, WebLogic application  Server, WebSphere application are all categorized in the middleware bucket. This  categorization helps the user to find resources of the same or similar type. Enterprise  Manager. It also captures the finer details of software resources—like patches applied.

Unmanned monitoring Enterprise Manager monitors IT resources around the clock and it gathers all  performance indicators at every fixed interval. Whenever a performance indicator  goes beyond the defined acceptable limit, Enterprise Manager records that  occurrence. For example, if the acceptable limit of CPU utilization for a server is 70%,  then whenever CPU utilization of the server goes above 70% then that occurrence  is recorded. Enterprise Manager can also send notification of any such occurrence  through common notification mechanisms like email, pager, SNMP trap, and so on.  Historical data analysis All of the performance indicators captured by Enterprise Manager are saved in   the repository. Enterprise Manager provides some useful views of the data using   the system administrator that can analyze data over a period of time. Besides the  fine-grained data that is collected at every fixed interval, it also provides coarse  views by rolling up the data every hour and every 24 hours.  [ 16 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 1  Configuration management  Enterprise Manager gathers configuration data for IT resources at regular intervals  and checks for any configuration compliance violation. Any such violation is  captured and can be sent out as a notification. Enterprise Manager comes with   many out-of-the-box configuration compliance rules that represent best practices;   in addition to that, system administrators can configure their own rules.   All of the configuration data is also saved in the Enterprise Manager repository.  Using data, the system administrator can compare the configuration of two   similar IT resources or compare the configuration of the same IT resource   at two different points in time. The system administrator can also see the  configuration change history.  Managing multiple entities as one  Most of the more recent applications are built with multi-tiered architecture and each  tier may run on different IT resources. For example, an order booking application can  have all of its presentation and business logic running on a J2EE server, all business  data persisted in a database, all authentication and authorization performed   through an LDAP server, and all of the traffic to the application routed through   an HTTP server.  To monitor such applications, all of the underlying resources need to be monitored.  Enterprise Manager provides support for grouping such related IT resources.   Using this support, the system administrator can monitor all related resources as   one entity and all performance indicators for all related entities can be monitored  from one interface.  Service level management Enterprise Manager provides necessary constructs and interfaces for managing  service level agreements that are based on the performance of IT resources. Using  these constructs, the user can define indicators to measure service levels and  expected service levels. For example, a service representing a web application can  have the same average JSP response time as a service indicator, the expected service  level for this service is to have the service indicator below three seconds for 90% of  the time during business hours.  Enterprise Manager keeps track of all such indicators and violations in the context of  a service and at any time the user can see the status of such service level agreements  over a defined time period.

For example, database backup is performed every day at midnight for  all of the database servers in a data center. Typically, system administrators write  some scripts and use some scheduling mechanism like crontabs to perform these  operations. Monitoring of such operations across multiple servers is expensive; the  system administrator needs to check logs on each server and maintain scripts on  each server and so on.  Enterprise Manager also provides a scheduling mechanism and, using that  mechanism, the user can execute an operation on multiple resources as per the  defined schedule. The outcome of all such operations, across multiple resources, is  saved in the Enterprise Manager repository and the system administrator can see all  of the results from one central console. Besides that, events like the success or failure  of an operation can be sent out as notifications via standard notification mechanisms  like email, SNMP trap, and so on.  Automating provisioning Initial provisioning of new IT resources is an expensive operation; the system  administrator needs to install the Operating System, all required software like the  database, J2EE server, all required patches, and the business applications. After  this, the system administrator needs to configure the software and applications.  Enterprise Manager provides support for building gold images from existing IT  resources, and provisioning new IT resources from the gold image. Using the gold  image, the system administrator can easily provision a new IT resource by cloning it  from an existing IT resource.  Enterprise Manager also provides a software library where the gold images of  Operating Systems, software, and so on, can be stored for future use.  Information publishing System administrators do need to publish data related to their data center; like  resource utilization data, configuration compliance data, inventory of resources,   and so on. Also, a lot of the data publishing activity has to be repeated at every fixed  interval, for example, resource utilization data needs to be published at the end of  every month.   [ 18 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 1  Enterprise Manager has a reporting and publishing framework to build and publish  reports in HTML format that summarize the data available in the Enterprise  Manager repository. Report generation can be scheduled and the generated reports  are also saved in the repository. These reports can be automatically sent out by  emails as per the schedule defined by the system administrators.  There are many useful out-of-the-box reports that the system administrator   can use to publish performance data, configuration compliance data, and so on.  System administrators can also customize or build new reports through the   intuitive user interface.   Synthetic transaction There are times when all of the performance indicators are within acceptable ranges,  but users still complain for about application performance. To troubleshoot such  issues, system administrators often log in to the application to try to simulate what  the real users do. Sometimes such problems are related to some specific geographic  regions only, for example, customers in Europe cannot check out the shopping cart  but customers in other countries are fine.  Recording typical user actions and repeating those instructions from different  geographical regions can provide proactive monitoring for such issues. Enterprise  Manager provides a framework for such support where typical user behavior can be  recorded and repeated from various geographical locations. In the example above,  Enterprise Manager can record the web transaction for checking out of the shopping  cart and can repeat this synthetic transaction from various locations.  Web transactions can be used for checking availability for web applications.  Enterprise Manager provides other mechanisms to check the availability of   other resources like TNSPING to check the availability of a database.   Manage from anywhere Enterprise Manager has a multi-tiered architecture; with the presentation layer on a  J2EE server and content that is presented in HTML format. The Enterprise Manager  console can be accessed through a browser that the system administrator can   access remotely. Enterprise Manager is certified for all major browsers like   Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, Mozilla, and so on.

Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control: Th This flavor of Enterprise Manager  needs its own installation. This product can manage all of the resources in a  data center. In this book we'll learn more details about this particular flavor  of Enterprise Manager product.  Products managed by Enterprise   Manager  Enterprise manager is a system management product from the Oracle Corporation  that provides a set of features for the comprehensive management of Oracle  products like Oracle Database, Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle SOA suite, Oracle  Applications, and so on. Enterprise Manager also provides management support for  non-Oracle products including databases like SQL Server, middleware platforms  such as JBoss Application Server, IBM WebSphere MQ, and storage management  system such as NetApp.   As mentioned in the initial introduction, data centers contain many types of IT  resources from different vendors, and different technology platforms. There may  also be homegrown products or applications in data centers. Enterprise Manager  provides management support for most of the common resources, but there could  be some resources for which there is no support out-of-box. Enterprise Manager  provides a framework to extend management support for such resources. Using   this, users and third party vendors can build custom management support. In  Chapter 12, we'll cover this extensibility in more detail. Functionality for such  support is packaged as plug-ins that can be deployed on top of Enterprise   Manager. For example, there are some plug-ins available for .NET and BizTalk  server. For a complete list of available plug-ins, please refer to the Oracle web site.

A system administrator can access this data or initiate or  schedule an operation though the console. The next diagram shows a sample setup  of the Enterprise Manager:  Grid Control Console  1  http:  host1.acme.com:7777 em  OracleAS Web Cache  Oracle Management Agent  Oracle HTTP Server  Oracle Management Service  http:  host1.acme.com:4889 em upload  2  JDBC  3  Management Repository  Oracle Management Agent  agent_host  >:1831  http:  < 4  Oracle Management Agent  Oracle Management Agent  Oracle Management Agent  Oracle Management Agent  Before we get into the details of each component, one Enterprise Manager term,  target, should be introduced. Target is very central for the EM system and everything  moves around various target models.  [ 22 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 1  Target Target is a generic term that refers to any managed entity that is managed by  Enterprise Manager. For each target there is a model of the target stored in the  Enterprise Manager repository. There are various target types available out-of- the-box like target types for a WebLogic server, or target types for BPEL Process  Manager. The target model contains all the properties needed for managing the  target. For example, a model for the WebLogic server contains JMX URL and  credentials to connect to JMX server. The target model also defines what metrics  should be collected for a target, the associated thresholds for those metrics and the  collection frequency for those metrics.   At a broad level, targets are of two types—the agent target, and the repository only  target. Agent targets are the target models that get created as the end result of the  discovery process. The agent and the repository maintain the definition and model  of such targets. Metrics for such targets are collected by the agent and uploaded  to the repository. The repository only targets are targets that get created only in  the repository—they may get created as part of the discovery process or they may  be created manually. All of the metric calculations of such targets are done in the  repository. For example, WebLogic Managed Server is modeled as an agent target  and WebLogic Domain and WebLogic Cluster are modeled as repository   only targets.  Oracle Management Service  OMS  OMS is a central process for Enterprise Manager. It provides a set of common  services that help in the monitoring and management of a target. Some of those  services are job scheduling, notification, and so on. OMS collects data from all of  the agents and, after processing, persists it into the repository. For other system  management operations like backup recovery, OMS orchestrates the sequence of  events that need to be triggered on the agent for a given target.  OMS also communicates with the agent over HTTP HTTPS protocol and uses JDBC  to persist data in the repository.  Oracle Management Agent  OMA   The Oracle Management Agent process is a proxy process for Enterprise Manager  that collects data from targets and sends it to the Management repository. Generally  it is co-located on the same host where a target is running. In this book we will use  the terms OMA and agent interchangeably.

It also collects  monitoring and configuration information as per the target model, and uploads it  into the Management repository via services exposed by the Management service.  This collection of information is done as per the collection frequency defined by the  target model. During collection, metrics are evaluated against the thresholds defined  in the target model. In case metric values violate the thresholds, the agent generates  an alert and sends it to the Management Server.  The agent executes all of the operations that are triggered from OMS, at the end   of the operation the agent returns the status and output of such operations, for  example, a "start WebLogic server command" triggered from OMS is delegated to  the agent, after completion the agent sends the status and output of such commands  back to OMS.  Besides monitoring, the agent executes all of the operations that are scheduled from  OMS, and returns the status and output of such operations, for example, the agent  executes a start-stop operation scheduled from OMS and returns the status and  output of that operation.  Agents use a heartbeat mechanism to keep the Management Server informed  about the health of agent. The agent communicates with the Management Server  over HTTP HTTPS protocol. In more secure setups, agents need one password to  communicate with the management service.  Oracle Management Repository  OMR  OMR is the persistence store for all EM data. All data related to target models,  performance metrics and configuration metrics are persisted in the OMR. OMR also  keeps historical data that can be used for analyzing the performance of the system  over a period of time. Historical data related to configuration can be used to track  configuration changes. OMR is built using an Oracle Database.  Some data from the Oracle Management Repository is exposed via public views and  can be used for integration with external systems. The repository can be installed in a  pre-existing database or a new database.   In this book, we will use the terms Oracle Management Repository and repository  interchangeably.

Using the same console,  administrators can schedule and monitor various operations like backup recovery,  patching, and so on.  Enterprise Manager High Availability As Enterprise Manager becomes a central point for managing and monitoring a  complete IT infrastructure, the availability of Enterprise Manager itself is extremely  critical. To support the high availability of OMS, Enterprise Manager supports a  configuration where two or more OMSs are configured in active mode. To support  high availability of the persistence store Management Repository can be setup to  work with Oracle Real Application Cluster  RAC  database.   Summary In this chapter, we learnt about diversity in a data center and the challenges posed   by such diversity. We introduced Enterprise Manager Grid Control features and   its architecture.   Here are the key takeaways from this chapter:                      In typical data centers we see different types of hardware, Operating  Systems, databases, middleware servers, storage devices, network devices,  and so on.

After sleepless nights and many escalations from the user community, Rob felt   the heat. He convinced his management and fellow administrators to implement   proactive monitoring within their IT organization. He decided to do away with his  pride and an all scripts approach. The majority of Rob's applications ran on Oracle  Fusion Middleware and therefore, Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control was   the obvious choice.  In the last chapter, we introduced the architecture of Oracle Enterprise Manager   Grid Control. In this chapter, we will help you get started with the installation  process. The actual installation steps are very well documented in the Enterprise  Manual and we will not bore you to death by duplicating all those steps in this  chapter. Our primary goal is to help you get started with the installation of  Enterprise Manager Grid Control with the simplest configuration that you   can use, in conjunction with this book.  In this chapter, we will discuss the following:           Downloading and installing Oracle Management Service Installation of Oracle Management Agent Starting and stopping of Oracle Management Service Starting and stopping of Oracle Management Agent  Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating! So let us get started with the  installation of Enterprise Manager Grid Control 10g R5  10.2.0.5 .  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Installing Enterprise Manager Grid Control  Installation procedure In the last chapter, you learnt that Enterprise Manager Grid Control has three   main components:         The Oracle Management Service The Oracle Management Repository The Oracle Management Agent  Thus, the actual installation procedure may sound a bit overwhelming when you  think of a three-tier install. However, the reality is that the installation process is  a very straight-forward and well-documented procedure. To make it simple, we  recommend that you choose the default install type and install all components    at least the OMS and repository  on a single machine. But, before you get started  with the install, you will need to download the binaries that follow.  Pre-requisite Before you get started with the install, you will have to make sure that you have  the right resources on the machine that you are installing Grid Control on to. The  following table shows the minimum recommended resource requirement for Linux  or Windows environment. You will need to check the install guide for resource  requirements if you are using a different platform.  Component OMS Repository Agent  CPU speed 3 GHz 3 GHz 3 GHz  Required disk space 2GB 10GB 500 MB  Required Memory 2GB 2GB N.A.  If you are installing both OMS and Management Repository on the same machine,  we recommend that you have at least 4GB of RAM for better performance. You must  be wondering why Enterprise Manager Grid Control requires so much resource!  You have to understand that Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control is not a  development tool but an administration tool for managing production targets such  as databases and middleware. OMS runs an instance of Oracle Application Server  10g and the repository is based on an Oracle database.

We recommend that you  check the release notes available at Oracle Technology Network for your platform   for the required patch level for your operating system.  If you are using a UNIX environment, the installation process requires a super user  or  root  privileges on your box to run a script during the installation process. If you  do not have system administration privileges on your machine, you will have to  work with the system administrator to run the script before you can complete the  installation. Here are some other operating system's requirements that your system  must meet:        Make sure that the operating system user that you are using belongs to the  oinstall, dba, and osuser groups. Make sure that you can ping your server with the fully qualified host name   hostname.domainname . If you cannot ping your server using DNS, make  sure that you enter this name in the host's file   etc hosts UNIX .  Downloading the software The Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control software can be downloaded from  Oracle Technology Network at the following location: http:  www.oracle.com  technology software products oem index.html.  Note that you cannot install Grid Control OMS 10gR5 directly. You  will have to install Grid Control 10gR1 on Unix platform or 10gR2 on  Windows and then upgrade by applying the 10gR5  10.2.0.5  patchset.   This book primarily covers 10gR5 features and hence, we recommend that you install  this version. In order to install 10.2.0.5, you will need to download 10gR1 and the  10.2.0.5 patchset.

Installing OMS and repository  In this section, we will present you with some guidelines that you can use along with  the install guide. We are assuming that you are installing Grid Control for the first  time for a learning or testing purpose. Hence, we will focus on the simple install type  where both OMS and Repository are installed on the same machine. Also, we assume  that you will choose a new database for the management repository. This is the  fastest way to install Grid Control. This will install database software and create   the repository database.  Installing Grid Control 10gR1 or 10gR2 To get started with the install of Grid Control 10gR5, you will have to install 10gR1  on Linux 32 or 10gR2 on the Windows environment. Make sure that you have  downloaded the binaries to your server. Let us assume that you are installing   on a Linux 32 machine.  You can start Oracle Universal Installer by running the runInstaller  or setup.exe  on Microsoft Windows  from the top-level directory of the software binaries.  The installer verifies the pre-requisites  O S version, patch level, memory, and so on   when they get invoked. Some of the pre-requisite checks may fail and the installer  may ask you to proceed or cancel the install.

The installer will first install the binaries and then run the Configuration Wizard to  configure the OMS and the repository database. Before the Configuration Assistants  are run, the installer will prompt you to run some configuration scripts and you need  administration or  root  privileges to run these scripts. The Configuration Wizard  will fail if you do not run these scripts.  After the install is successfully completed, the installer will provide you with the  URL for the management console.

You will have   to enter SYSMAN as your user ID and the password that you entered during the  install process.  After a successful login, you will see the Grid Control, as in the following screenshot:   Upgrading to Grid Control 10gR5 Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 10gR5 is the latest version available and  includes several middleware management features. As mentioned, we really  recommend that you upgrade to 10gR5 to make the most of the benefits. You  can download the 10gR5 patch set from Oracle Technology Network. Follow the  instructions in the 10gR5 Release Notes for your platform. The patch installer will  upgrade your OMS and the repository database to 10gR5.

Unlike the OMS, the agent does not require you to  first install 10gR1. You can directly install the 10gR5 Agent. There are several ways to  install the Agent, yet for simplicity, the OUI method is recommended. You will have  to select the right option as shown:  Chapter 2  [ 35 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Installing Enterprise Manager Grid Control  The most important step in the Agent install is wiring or pointing your Agent to  your OMS as in the following screenshot:  This helps the OMS to discover the Agent, and therefore the targets, managed by the  agent. As soon as the agent is installed on the machine and it is started, the target  machine will be automatically discovered in the OMS. You will able to verify that  simply by logging into Enterprise Manager Grid Control and clicking on targets.   We will discuss this further in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic Server, when   we discover an Oracle WebLogic Server.  Starting and stopping Grid Control Now that we have completed the installation of Oracle Enterprise Manager   Grid Control, we will discuss how to start and stop the various components.   For a more detailed explanation of these commands or more detailed options,   we recommend that you follow the Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g Grid Control  Advanced Configuration Guide.

However, if  you are using Microsoft Windows then you can start the Windows Service for OMS.  Chapter 2  To automatically start the OMS and the underlying application server  processes, you will have to execute the following command:  emctl start oms You will see the following message:  Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g Release 5 Grid Control   Copyright  c  1996, 2009 Oracle Corporation.  All rights reserved. opmnctl: opmn started Starting HTTP Server ... Starting Oracle Management Server ... Checking Oracle Management Server Status ... Oracle Management Server is Up. To check the status of the OMS, you will have to use the following command:  emctl status oms To stop the OMS, you will use:  emctl stop oms  Although starting the OMS automatically starts the underlying Oracle Application  Server, it is worth knowing the commands to start, stop, and check the status of the  underlying server that powers the OMS.  Ensure that you are in $OMS_HOME oms bin when you execute these commands.   You can start the Application Server by entering the following code: opmnctl startall To check the status of Application Server, you can use the command: opmnctl status You can stop the Application Server by executing: opmnctl stopall  Note that the OMS is not started automatically when you reboot a   Linux UNIX machine. However, it is automatically restarted on a  Windows machine.

SQL> startup  The Oracle database is automatically restarted when you reboot the host machine;  you do not have to restart the database repository.  Starting and stopping the Agent Finally, we will discuss how to start stop the Agent, and how to verify whether the  Agent is responding properly. In UNIX environments, you will have to start the  Agent after the host machine is rebooted. In a Windows environment, the Agent   is a Windows service and will be started automatically.           To start the Agent, you have to use the following commands: emctl start agent To stop the Agent: emctl stop agent To verify the health of the Agent emctl status agent           [ 38 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 2  Summary By exploring the various stages of installing Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control,  we should now be aware of the following:           Where to go to download Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g Grid Control and  the installation procedure for each component That installation with the new database is the simplest and fastest way to get  started with EM Grid Control How to execute basic commands to start stop and check the status of the  different components of Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control Control  In the next chapter, we will be discussing basic concepts in enterprise applications  and systems management.

Many of the technical and functional subsystems need to be tweaked  or customized according to the needs of a particular enterprise. Good enterprise  software is one that provides useful out-of-the-box features that need minimal or   no customizations of the subsystems, and at the same time provides flexibility   for customizations.   Most often we see that, while using enterprise software, System Administrators  discover an un-documented feature, or use an existing feature or a subsystem in   an innovative way. This helps to get better returns on the investment made on the  enterprise software. Hence, it's very important that the System Administrators   and IT Managers are aware of major processes and subsystems in any given  enterprise software.   In this chapter, we'll learn about major processes and subsystems of Enterprise  Manager Grid Control, and the concepts behind those subsystems.  The subsystems that we'll be covering in this chapter are as follows:                   Target Monitoring Configuration Management Jobs  Notification Provisioning Service Level Management Information publishing  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems  Target  As seen in Chapter 1, the term 'target' refers to an entity that is managed via  Enterprise Manager Grid Control. Target is the most important entity in Enterprise  Manager Grid Control. All other processes and subsystems revolve around the  target subsystem. For each target there is a model of the target that is saved in the  Enterprise Manager Repository. In this book, we will use the terms target and target  model interchangeably.  Major building blocks of the target subsystem are:  Target definition All targets are organized into different categories, just like the actual entity that they  represent, for example there is WebLogic Server target, Oracle Database target, and  so on. These categories are called target types.  For each target type there is a definition in XML format that is available with the  agent as well as with the repository. This definition includes:            Target Attributes: There are some attributes that are common across all   target types, and there are some attributes specific to a particular target  type. The example of a common attribute is the target name, which uniquely  identifies a managed entity. The example of a target type specific attribute is  the name of a WebLogic Domain for a WebLogic Server target. Some of   the attributes provide connection details for connecting to the monitored  entity, such as the WebLogic Domain host and port. Some other attributes  contain authentication information to authenticate and connect to the  monitored entity. Target associations: Target type definition includes the association between  related targets, for example an OC4J target will have its association defined  with a corresponding Oracle Application Server. Target Metrics: This includes all the metrics that need to be collected for a  given target and the source for those metrics. We'll cover this in greater detail  in the Metrics subsystem.  Every target that is managed through the EM belongs to one, and only one, target type  category. For any new entity that needs to be managed by the Enterprise Manager, an  instance of appropriate target type is created and persisted in the repository.   [ 42 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 3  Out-of-the-box Enterprise Manager provides the definition for most common target  types  such  as  the  Host,  Oracle  Database,  Oracle  WebLogic  Server,  Seibel  suite,  SQLServer, SAP, .NET platform, IBM Websphere application server, Jboss application  server, MQSeries, and so on. For a complete list of out-of-the-box targets please refer For a complete list of out-of-the-box targets please refer  to the Oracle website.  Now that we have a good idea about the target definition, it's time we get to know  more about the target lifecycle.   Target lifecycle  As the target is very central to the Enterprise Manager—it's very important that we  understand each stage in the target life cycle.  Please note that not all the stages of the lifecycle may be needed for each target.  However, to proceed further we need to understand each step in the target lifecycle.  Enterprise Manager automates many of these stages, so in a real life scenario  many of these steps may be transparent to the user. For example, Discovery and  Configuration for monitoring stages are completely automated for the Oracle  Application Server.  Discovery of a target Discovery is the first step in the target lifecycle. Discovery is a process that finds the  entities that need to be managed, builds the required target model for those entities,  and persists the model in the management repository. For example, the discovery  process executed on a Linux server learns that there are OC4J containers on that  server, it builds target models for the OC4Js and the Linux server, and it persists  the target models in the repository.  The agent has various discovery scripts and those scripts are used to identify various  target types. Besides discovery, these scripts build a model for the discovered target  and fill in all of the attributes for that target. We learnt about target attributes in the  previous section.  Some discovery scripts are executed automatically as a part of the agent installation  and therefore, no user inputs are needed for discovery. For example, a discovery  script for the Oracle Application Server is automatically triggered when an agent is  installed. On the other hand, there are some discovery scripts where the user needs  to provide some input parameters. An example for this is the WebLogic server,  where the user needs to provide the port number of the WebLogic Administration  Server and credentials to authenticate and connect to it. The Enterprise Manager  console provides interface for such discovery.

In  local mode, the agent is running locally on the same host as the target. In remote  discovery mode, the agent can be running on a different host. All of the targets can  be discovered in local mode and there are some targets that can be discovered in  remote mode. For example, discovery of WebLogic servers can happen in local as  well as remote mode.   One important point to note is that the agent that discovered the  target does the monitoring of that target. For example, if a WebLogic  Server target is discovered through a remote agent it gets monitored  through that same remote agent.  The next screenshot shows the screen where the user needs to provide inputs for the  WebLogic discovery:  [ 44 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 3  Configuration for monitoring After discovery the target needs to be configured for monitoring. The user will  need to provide some parameters for the agent to use to connect to the target and  get the metrics. These parameters include monitoring credentials, host, and port  information, using which, the agent can connect to the target to fetch the metrics.  The Enterprise Manager uses these parameters to connect, authenticate, and collect  metrics from the targets. For example, to monitor an Oracle database the end user  needs to provide the user ID and password, which can be used for authentication  when collecting performance metrics using SNMP protocol.  Enterprise Manager Console provides an interface for configuring these parameters.  For some targets such as Application server, this step is not needed, as all the metrics  can be fetched anonymously. For some other targets such as Oracle BPEL Process  Manager, this step is needed only for detailed metrics; basic metrics are available  without any monitoring configuration, but for advanced metrics monitoring,  credentials needs to be provided by the end user. In this case, monitoring credentials  are the user ID and password, used to authenticate when connecting to BPEL Process  Manager for collecting performance metrics.  Updates to a target  Over a period of time, some target properties, attributes, and associations with other  targets change—the EM target model that represents the target should be updated  to reflect the changes. It is very important that end-users see the correct model from  Enterprise Manager to ensure that all targets are monitored correctly. For example,  in a given WebLogic Cluster, if a new WebLogic Server is added and an existing  WebLogic Server is removed—Enterprise Manager's target model needs to reflect  that. Or, if credentials to connect to WebLogic Admin Server are changed—the   target model should be updated with new credentials. The Enterprise Manager  console provides UI interface to update such properties.   If the target model is not updated there is a risk that some entity may not be  monitored, for example if a new WebLogic server is added but the target model   of domain is not updated, the new WebLogic server will not be monitored.

During such  time it's desirable to stop monitoring a target and collecting metrics for that resource.  This can be achieved by putting that target into a blackout state. In a blackout state,  agents do not collect monitoring data for a target and they do not generate alerts. After  the maintenance activity is over, the blackout can be cleared from a target and routine  monitoring can start again. Enterprise Manager Console provides an interface for  creating and removing blackout state for one or more targets.  Monitoring Enterprise Manager performs round-the-clock monitoring of targets by collecting  the performance data. Unmanned monitoring is one of the key features of Enterprise  Manager Grid Control. Monitoring subsystem is a crucial piece in unmanned  monitoring of targets. Let's learn about monitoring subsystem.  We will now see the major building blocks of the monitoring subsystem in subsystem in in   greater detail.  Fetchlets A managed resource can expose performance indicators through various interfaces  like JMX, SNMP, and so on. For example, WebLogic Server performance indicators  are exposed through a JMX interface. Enterprise Manager provides executables that  can access performance data from most of the standard interfaces. These executables  are called fetchlets. There is one fetchlet for each data access mechanism. Some  useful fetchlets are SNMP, JMX, and URLXML fetchlets, which can be used to   access data from SNMP interface; JMX interface, and URL interfaces respectively.   For a complete list of available fetchlets, please refer to the Enterprise   Manager documentation.  Metrics definition Metrics is the performance data that is collected from each target at fixed intervals  and can also be collected on demand. The metrics definition for a target type defines  all performance indicators that need to be collected and what fetchlet should be used  to collect those indicators. This is defined in a template file. This template file is very  important and we'll be referring to this file by the term target metadata.  For a given target type, the collection frequency of the metrics is defined in another  template and we refer to that as a target collection file.

After collection, the data is kept at a staging location; from there it is uploaded into  the repository at fixed intervals. All performance metric data is persisted in the  repository and can be used to analyze a system's performance over a period of time.  For coarse views, these metrics are rolled up every hour and every 24 hours. Data  aggregated every hour is kept for 31 days and data aggregated for 24 hours is kept  for 365 days. Raw data received from the agent is only kept for seven days. Data  purge policies can be configured to suit user needs.  The following screenshot shows one such example, detailing the average execution  for one of the web services deployed on a WebLogic Server. From this view, the user  can see real-time data or historical data.

Firstly, the user can see and analyze data over a period of time. Secondly, any  time a particular data value crosses acceptable limits; Enterprise Manager can keep  track of such instances.  The user can define thresholds to in turn define the acceptable limits of   performance metrics. Enterprise Manager supports two levels of thresholds for the  metrics—warning and critical threshold. For example, a CPU % usage metric can  have 70% as warning and 90% as critical threshold. Enterprise Manager provides  default thresholds for many metrics that the user can customize. For metrics where  no thresholds are defined, the users can define them.  Whenever a metric data value crosses the threshold, an alert is generated and stored  in the Management repository. If a warning threshold is violated; a warning alert is  generated, and if a critical threshold is violated; a critical alert is generated. These  alerts can be used for generating some form of notification.   Monitoring templates Monitoring template is a construction, using which, one can define the thresholds for  a target type, and can apply this template to multiple targets of the same type. When  there are multiple targets of same type, setting thresholds for all such targets can be  a tedious task. Monitoring templates can make it simpler by providing one central  place to define thresholds for all targets of the same type.  System Administrator can also define default-monitoring template for a given target  type. Once a template is marked as default for a target type, all new targets of the  same type will automatically get the same thresholds as defined in the template.  Recommendation:  Define default-monitoring template for all target types  in the datacenter and add metric thresholds to the template. This will  ensure that all targets of the same type will have the same thresholds.

For collection of configuration data, Enterprise Manager uses  the same mechanism as performance metrics, that is; all the configuration to be  collected and mechanisms to collect are defined in target metadata, and frequency of  configuration collection is defined in target collection. Agent collects configuration  data and uploads it into the repository.  Though the data collection mechanism is the same for performance and configuration  data, the usage of configuration data is very different from the usage of performance  data. Configuration data is used for ensuring configuration compliance and  configuration change tracking.  Let us look into building blocks that provide configuration compliance and   change tracking.  Policy Enterprise Manager Grid Control provides policy subsystem for configuration and  security compliance.  Policy is a construct to define configurations and security recommendations for a  given target type. For example, a security policy for OC4J recommends that all data  sources should not have passwords in clear text; a configuration policy for WebLogic  server recommends that the server should be running in production mode. The  Enterprise Manager uses these policies to periodically check for conformance across  multiple targets in a given datacenter.  Enterprise Manager comes with lots of out-of-the-box policies and users can  customize those policies and define new policies; Enterprise Manager Console  provides interface to customize or define new policies.  Policies are defined for a target type and can be enforced for all targets of a given type  or only for some targets of a given type. The end user can configure what policies  need  to  be  enforced  for  a  given  target.  For  example,  if  there  is  a  policy  for  a  host  target type that mandates that only port 80 should be open on all servers—the System mandates that only port 80 should be open on all servers—the System —the System  Administrator may decide not to enforce that policy for a new server that is used for  developmental activity.  [ 49 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems  Each policy definition is associated with a severity level. There are three severity  levels, which are Informational, Warning, and Critical. Enterprise Manager  evaluates these policies against the configuration data that is collected from the  targets. Any violation of these policies is saved in the repository and can be used   for sending out notifications.  We learnt in an earlier section how monitoring template can be used to set thresholds  across  multiple  same  targets.  Policies  can  also  be  added  to  a  monitoring  template  along with a metric threshold.  Recommendation:  Define default-monitoring template for all  target types in datacenter and add policies to the default template.  This will ensure that all targets of the same type have the same  configuration and security compliance.  Configuration snapshot Configuration snapshot of a target is a set of all configuration parameters at one  point in time. Enterprise Manager keeps all related configuration for a target as  configuration snapshot.  Enterprise Manager keeps a track of configuration changes by using configuration  snapshots. When uploading a new configuration snapshot, it compares the new  configuration snapshot with the existing snapshot, and the changes are saved  separately in the repository.  Besides keeping track of changes, configuration snapshot can be used to compare the  configuration of one target with multiple targets of the same type.  Comparing configurations is a critical part of any IT operations and troubleshooting.  It is common to find that an application will work in one environment and not  work in another environment. The fastest way to troubleshoot this is to compare the  configuration between two environments, but configuration comparison can be a  dreary job and issues are likely to be missed by the human eye, as configuration is  spread out in multiple files across servers.

Enterprise Manager provides a  framework where a unit of work to be done is defined as a job, these jobs can be  scheduled to run on multiple targets and the outcome of that is persisted in the  repository. For the scheduling of a job, Enterprise Manager console provides an  interface, using which the user can specify the parameters to be passed on to the   job and the targets where the job needs to be executed.  For example, the Database backup job contains all the details on how to perform  database backup. Enterprise Manager console provides an interface to select on  which database this operation needs to be run, what is the backup mode  online,  offline , and what is the schedule to run this job.  Success or failure of the job execution can also be sent out as a notification.  [ 51 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems  Major building blocks of job system are as follows:           Job Definition: Job definition contains the parameters required by the job  and the sequence of steps to be performed. It provides rich support for the  orchestration of multiple steps in a job, like conditionally running some steps  based on the outcome of earlier steps, waiting for one step to complete before  starting the next and so on. Out-of-the-box Enterprise Manager provides many job definitions, like   Oracle Application Server backup, WebLogic start stop, and so on. Job Library: To run a job, System Administrators provide input parameters  for a job, and a schedule to run the job. Sometimes the Administrator who  can provide input parameters is different from the Administrator who  schedules the job.  Job library provides the support where one Administrator can fill in all   parameters in the job and save it in the job library; another Administrator   can just pick up a job and schedule the execution of job. This feature is very  useful when there are multiple levels of System Administrators, super   Administrators can define the jobs parameters and save in the job library,   and Operators can execute schedule the jobs. Multi-tasking jobs: Often, Administrators need to schedule multiple jobs in  a particular sequence. Enterprise Manager provides "Multi-task job", using  this, the Administrator can combine multiple jobs and run them as one job.  Enterprise Manager console UI provides an interface for defining multi-task  jobs where the user can define what jobs need to be run and in what order.  Multi-task jobs can also be saved in job library.  Notification system As we saw in the earlier sections, Enterprise Manager collects monitoring and  configuration information round-the-clock, and schedules the job at a specified time.  All of these activities continue to happen even when nobody is actively looking at  Enterprise Manager. Whenever required, System Administrators can see the history  of metric alert, policy violation or job results. But there are some alerts, policy  violations, or job results that need immediate attention. Enterprise Manager provides  notification framework, and by using this, notifications for alerts, policy violations,  and job failures can be sent out.  [ 52 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 3  Major building blocks of Notification system are:          Notification Methods  Enterprise Manager provides support for various notification methods that  include SNMP trap, emails, and so on. Enterprise Manager console provides  an interface for configuring the notification methods. For example, console  provides an interface to configure SNMP notifications, where the user can  provide details like SNMP community, SNMP host, SNMP port, and so on. Notification Rules System Administrator should get paged only for the critical resources   and only for the critical performance indicators or policy violations.   Enterprise Manager provides support for Notification rules AND using   that, Administrators can define for what type of events a notification   should be sent out and which notification method should be used.  Provisioning The provisioning subsystem provides support for automating provisioning  of software on multiple targets. Using provisioning subsystem, the System  Administrator can do initial provisioning of software, for example provisioning  of Linux operating system and RAC database on a new host. Provisioning system  also provides support for provisioning software from a reference installation,  where Enterprise Manager can clone software from reference environment to new  environment. For example, if a database instance is running on host1, Enterprise  Manager can provision a new database instance on host2 by cloning the database  instance on host1.  Major building blocks of provisioning subsystem are:  Deployment procedures  Deployment procedures define the steps that need to be executed to achieve a  particular objective. For example, the deployment procedure for J2EE server  installation defines all of the steps that need to be executed to install a J2EE server.   The provisioning subsystem provides out-of-the-box deployment procedures  for most common provisioning operations, it also provides support to customize  existing deployment procedures or to define a new deployment procedure.  Provisioning subsystem also provides support for scheduling and executing these  deployment procedures. Enterprise Manager console provides an interface for  scheduling deployment procedure and monitoring the status of scheduled   deployment procedure.

Provisioning framework uses Software Library for storing gold images  and provisioning new software from the images. For example, the provisioning  subsystem can build a gold image from an existing Linux setup and store it in the  software library. At some later point in time the provisioning subsystem can use the  stored gold image to provision a new Linux host.  Software library also provides support for versioning, maturity levels  beta,  production  for installable software and gold images. Enterprise Manager Console  provides interface to browse the contents of software library, and update the version,  maturity level of software, and gold images.  Service Level Management We saw in earlier sections that using target subsystem and monitoring subsystem  we can monitor any resource in a datacenter. We can see the availability of any IT  resource by looking at the history of status metrics. In the traditional approach, the  history of status metric is good enough to measure system performance. In most of the datacenters today, IT systems performance is measured by Service  Level Agreements  SLA . SLA includes the performance indicators to be used,  thresholds for the performance indicators, and expected availability of the IT  resource in terms of the performance indicators. For example, one sample SLA for a  Linux host includes CPU usage and IO rate as performance indicator; it also includes  acceptable thresholds for CPU and IO rate. This SLA measures the availability of  Linux servers in terms of CPU usage and IO rate.  Enterprise Manager provides support for defining and monitoring service level  agreements. It provides necessary backend support and console UI, using that, SLA  can be defined and stored in the repository. It also provides a console interface to  monitor SLA performance over a period of time.

You can see that a  user can select the performance indicators to be included in SLA definition.

Report is a construct that is used for publishing data   from the Enterprise Management repository.  Enterprise Manager provides a lot of out-of-the-box reports, that the user can  customize or use as-is. For example, a report on all policy violations, or a report on  all metric alerts, or a report on all configuration changes. Besides these reports, the  user can create new reports through the Enterprise Manager console.   We will now learn about the  major building blocks for Information Publishing System.  Report definition Report definition contains details like what data should be shown, how to get that  data, layout of the report, parameters for the report, and at what frequency the report  should be generated. For example, a particular report provides details about the  performance of a BPEL process, the data for this report is shown in tabular format  and one pie chart and this report is generated every 24 hours, this report is also  emailed out to some specific email ids.  Report element Report elements are reusable components that users can include in the report  definition when defining new reports. For example "Table from SQL" element can  be used to extract data from repository, and to use this element the user needs to  provide a query. At runtime this query is executed against the repository and the  data is inserted into the report.  Information publishing system provides support for scheduling of the reports,  using that the user can define a schedule from the console to generate the reports.  Generated reports are saved in the repository. Also, these reports can be sent out   by emails.

We learnt about the major building blocks for each of the subsystems.   Here are the key takeaways from this chapter.  Chapter 3                               Users should be aware of subsystems of enterprise software.  Target subsystem provides support for target type definition and target  lifecycle. Target type definition contains attributes, metric definition, and  associations with other targets. Monitoring subsystem provides support for collecting metrics, aggregating  metrics, and raising alerts.  Configuration management provides support for policy definitions and  conformance of policies in datacenter; any non-conformance is raised as  policy violation. As best practice, you should use monitoring templates to define the metrics  threshold and policies across targets. Job system provides scheduling mechanism. Job library provides ready-run  jobs where the parameters are already filled in and any operator can execute  the jobs. You can use Multi-task jobs to chain multiple jobs and run them as  one job. You can define the alerts, policy violations, and job statuses for which you  want notifications to be sent out for.  Provision subsystem can be used to provision software from installation  media or reference installations. Service Level Agreements  SLA  can be defined and saved in the repository.  Enterprise Manager provides a view of SLA performance over a period   of time. You can use information publishing system to publish pre-defined reports   or create your own reports. Enterprise Manager console provides GUI to  define new reports. Reports can be scheduled, and all generated reports   can be persisted in the repository. Additionally these reports can be sent   out via email.  We have covered the key subsystems of Enterprise Manager Grid Control, so now  we have a good insight into how these subsystems work and how we can customize  them. It's time we apply this knowledge to see how Enterprise Manager manages  middleware targets. In the next chapter we'll be learning about managing and  monitoring Oracle WebLogic Server using the Enterprise Manager.

Oracle  completed the acquisition of BEA Systems in June 2008. WebLogic Server was the  flagship product offered by BEA systems and is used by many organizations to  deploy their enterprise Java and SOA applications. In this chapter, you will learn  about the following:         Introduction to Oracle WebLogic Server and it's architecture Discovering WebLogic Server Domains  Monitoring and configuration management of WebLogic Server Domains  and applications, and service level management of applications running on  WebLogic Server  Introducing WebLogic Server WebLogic Server is a Java EE application server where you run enterprise Java  applications. Most organizations want their production applications to be highly  scalable and available. Hence, most often you will run more than one instance of  WebLogic Server in your environment.

A WebLogic Server Domain may consist of one Administration Server, one  or more managed servers, one or more clusters, and one or more node managers.  The Administration Server is used for administration purposes and has to be  available for any configuration changes such as the deployment of applications. The  Administration Server is a WebLogic Server instance that hosts the Administration  Console and contact point for command line interface. You can deploy custom  applications to the administration server like any other managed server, however,  we do not recommend you do that.

A managed server is used  for deploying customer applications. A managed server may be running on the  same or a remote server machine where the Administration Server is running.  The Administration Server manages the lifecycle of the managed server with node  manager. A node manager is a separate server process that runs on a server machine  to facilitate the administration of the managed servers.  A WebLogic Server Cluster consists of multiple Oracle WebLogic Managed Server  instances running simultaneously and working together to provide increased  scalability and reliability.  For more information about WebLogic Server please refer to WebLogic Server  documentation at http:  download.oracle.com docs cd E13160_01 wli  docs10gr3 index.html.  Oracle Enterprise Manager manages an Oracle WebLogic Server domain  as a single entity. You can monitor multiple domains of WebLogic Server  from a single instance of Oracle Enterprise manager Grid Control.  Supported versions You can manage different versions of WebLogic Servers from a single install of  Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control. Following is the support matrix for Oracle  Enterprise Manager for Oracle WebLogic Server:  EM Version WebLogic   10.2.0.5 10.2.0.4 10.2.0.3  10.3.x Yes No No  WebLogic  10.0 Yes Yes No  WebLogic  9.x Yes Yes Yes  WebLogic  8.1 Yes Yes Yes  WebLogic  7.x Yes Yes Yes  [ 61 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server Discovering WebLogic Server A target such as WebLogic Server Domain has to be added into Enterprise Manager  for management purposes. This process is called target discovery. As you remember  from our discussion in Chapters 1 and 3, the agent facilitates the discovery and  management of a target. Hence, you need an Oracle Management Agent to discover  monitor a WebLogic Server Domain. The agent talks to the Administration Server  using Java Management Extension  JMX  API. The agent can either be in the same  server host that the Administration Server is running on, or can be on a remote  machine. We recommend that you use a local agent. You can monitor multiple  WebLogic Server domains from a single agent. However, it is recommended that  you do not monitor more than five domains or 30 managed servers using a single  domain. Similarly, we recommend that you do not monitor different versions of  WebLogic Servers using a single agent.  The agent requires access to the WebLogic Server binaries for discovery  and monitoring purposes. If you are using a remote discovery then you  have to copy WebLogic JAR files such as weblogic.jar or wlclient. jar file from your WebLogic Server install to the server host where agent  is running. If you are using a local agent then ensure the agent user has  access to the WebLogic Server binaries  weblogic.jar  and the BEA_HOME  environment variable is set if you are using UNIX Linux environment.   Adding a new WebLogic Server Domain Let us now discuss the steps required to discover or add a WebLogic Server Domain  into Enterprise Manager Grid Control.   In order to discover a new WebLogic Domain from Grid Control follow these steps  after logging into Grid Control as an administrator:   	 Click on Targets on the top menu bar and select Middleware and you will  see the current list of middleware targets. If you have not discovered any  middleware then you will need the Oracle Application Server target on  which the Enterprise Manager Grid Control runs on.

If the agent is running on the same machine then it automatically finds the  WebLogic Server home if the BEA_HOME environment is set. If the Oracle  Agent is located in a remote server then you have to supply agent details   and the location where WebLogic Client libraries are located.  Most people use the default WebLogic user to manage WebLogic Server.  However, WebLogic Server provides role-based access control. You may be  in a highly secured environment and you want to monitor your WebLogic  Server domain with a low privileged user. EM Grid Control allows you to  monitor WebLogic Servers with Monitors privilege. While discovering your WebLogic Server Domain, you can specify the low  privileged username. Note, that the users in the Monitors Group do not have  privileges to start stop WebLogic Server instances and hence you will not be  able to recycle managed servers from Grid Control.   	 On the next page, you will be prompted to supply the host machine   credentials for the host where Oracle Agent is running. After supplying the  host credentials and clicking Next, Enterprise Manager will find the managed  servers and clusters in the domain and you can select the servers clusters  that you want to manage monitor from EM.

Once you confirm  your selection, the WebLogic Domain with the servers and clusters will be  discovered and you are good to go! You have to ensure that all managed  servers and clusters that you plan to manage from Enterprise Manager are up  and running during the discovery process. If a server is not started up then  Enterprise Manager does not find during discovery process.  Enterprise Manager does not automatically discover if any  managed server is not up during discovery or newly added  server cluster. If there is a change in your domain then you  have to refresh the domain using the Refresh Domain button  in the WebLogic Server Domain Home Page.  Monitoring WebLogic Server You can monitor both the availability and performance of WebLogic Server Domains  from Enterprise Manager. You can view both real time and historical metrics of your  WebLogic Server Domains. As we discussed earlier, WebLogic Server has three  distinct entities such as WebLogic Server Domain, cluster and managed server. Each  of these are modeled as separate targets in Enterprise Manager. Thus each domain,  managed server and cluster has separate homepages, status, and so on.   Availability and state  You can monitor the status of WebLogic Server. WebLogic Server has several states  such as RUNNING, ADMIN, SHUTDOWN, STARTING, and so on. However,  an Enterprise Manager target can have only two statuses either UP or DOWN. In  a production monitoring purpose it makes sense because your applications are  unavailable when the WebLogic Server is in a state other than RUNNING. Enterprise  Manager shows the status as UP only when the state of the WebLogic Server is  RUNNING and if the server is in some other state such as ADMIN, STARTING,   and so on, then Enterprise Manager reports the status as DOWN.   The clusters and domain are the collection of one and more managed servers and  they do not have their own status. The status for the managed servers are aggregated  and shown for clusters and domains. Hence if a domain has 5 managed servers and  a cluster with 4 managed servers and the Administration Server, and one managed  server is down, then the status of the domains will be reported as 4 Up 1 Down   and 3 Up 1 Down. Similarly, other information such as metrics alerts and policy  violations are all aggregated for the domain and clusters and shown in the   Domain and Cluster Homepage.

For example, the WebLogic Server homepage provides the  availability status for the last 24 hours and you can click on the availability link to  view the history for down time.  The default view shows the availability for the past 24 hours and you can customize  by clicking the view data drop-down at the top of the page.

You can view both real time and historical performance  metrics for resources such as Data Sources and JMS, or applications metrics such  as EJB, Web services, JSP Servlets, and so on. We will not bore you to death by  telling you how to navigate pages to do this, but we will spend time on looking at  how to proactively monitor for specific performance metrics and get notifications.  A question may come to your mind, Enterprise Manager provides a lot of metrics   under the All Metrics page , but not all of these are exposed in the Graph. How do  I create some custom graphs for using these metrics? You can do this by building a  new service. We will also discuss the creation of service later in this chapter.   Event notifications and setting metric  thresholds In a production environment you want to be proactive and want to be alerted when  a problem occurs or a metric threshold is reached. Many Administrators write scripts  to check for thresholds at regular intervals and check them manually. Enterprise  Manager helps to automate proactive monitoring. You may remember from our  discussion on alerts in Chapter 3 that Enterprise Manager lets you set thresholds  for metrics that you want to monitor, and it alerts you when the threshold is  reached. For example, you are using JRockit JVM and you want to be alerted when  the physical memory usage reaches a specific level such as 100MB, or you want  to be alerted when the invocation time for any Servlets JSPs is higher than your  expectation level.   In order to setup a metric alert you have to follow these steps: Navigate to the Home page of your WebLogic Server. Click Metric and Policy Settings on the WebLogic Server Home page and  you will get the follow screen. This will display the page that will show any  existing metric threshold settings.

You can change the warning and critical  thresholds of metrics that you want to monitor as follows and click OK   and you will get a confirmation that the update was successful.  The alerts will be shown in the WebLogic Server homepage  under metric alert   when such an event occurs as shown in the following figure:   Chapter 4  You can drill down a particular event by clicking on the alert text and you can see  the details of the metric alert as follows:  [ 67 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  You can acknowledge and clear the event or add a comment from this page. Adding  a comment or acknowledging an alert really helps when multiple administrators  monitor the same set of WebLogic Servers. The other administrators know that you  are investigating the problem.  Setting up notification methods The real benefit for alert notification is that the management system notifies you  when an event occurs. Enterprise Manager supports several notification mechanisms  such as e-mail, web page, SNMP trab, running a corrective action job or even  integration with ticketing systems such as Remedy or Siebel Helpdesk.  Let us dive down into how to setup a notification when an alert is raised. For  example, you want to get an e-mail when an alert is raised.  You have to perform the following steps to set up e-mail notification:      Click on Setup option at the top and then select the Notifications Methods  on the left and you will get the following page:     Enter the SMTP server and other properties required in your environment  and click on Apply. If you want to make sure that you have entered the  correct properties, click on Test Mail Server and you should get a test   e-mail from Enterprise Manager.

Each administrator may have separate  access and profiles. If you want to use Enterprise Manager to send e-mails to the  right administrators you have to set e-mail preferences for the admin user. Click on Preferences on the top and enter the e-mail address assigned for the   admin account as shown next. You may have more than one e-mail address for   an admin user.  Setting the notification rules You do not want to get paged for every event and you want to customize when you  want to get alerted. You have to set notification rules so let us learn how to do that:      Click on Rules on the left and you will get the screen with all the    notification rules as shown:      We want to create a new notification rule for the alerts on WebLogic Server.   Click on Create button and enter as details.

For example you want to be notified when the Server goes down or  the metric error is raised.   Click on Metrics tab and click on Add metrics and select the metrics you are  interested in.      [ 70 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Be sure to select the severity states—Critical Warning Clear—for which you want  to be notified.  Chapter 4  After you confirm the metrics, you will see the list of metrics that you have selected  for notification. Optionally, you can select a policy violation for notification. You can  also select a job as the notification method. Once you confirm the notification rule, it  will be created!  If an alert occurs it will come directly to your inbox. So, if you set up an e-mail  account on your Blackberry or iPhone, you will always be on top of the issues.  Enterprise Manager also allows you to set up a notification schedule and blackouts.  You may remember from our discussion earlier, that blackout is a time when you  do not want to get notified when an alert is raised. For example, you take your  WebLogic Servers down during the weekends and you probably do not want to  cause unnecessary panic during that period by false alerts. We leave you to explore  those as an exercise!  Jobs and corrective action Many enterprise systems and applications require batch jobs. For example,   you may have a requirement to restart your WebLogic Servers every Sunday at   mid-night or restart your WLST script that initializes some data for your application.  Many customers use cron jobs to automate such jobs. Enterprise Manager provides  capabilities to schedule one time or recurring jobs.  Let us discus how you can schedule a WebLogic Server control job to schedule a job  to restart WebLogic Server.

This page provides a list of jobs  submitted for the domain cluster.  We have to enter the schedule, credentials, job type, and so on for a job. You have to  enter a name for the job to uniquely identify the job. Note that these are stored in the  repository database.

After you schedule the job, the job will run as per the schedule. You can monitor the  job and see the history of the job. You may get an e-mail if the job fails.  Corrective action job Earlier in this chapter, we discussed alert notifications. Let's assume that you are  a very proactive administrator and want to fix it automatically when a problem  happens. For example, when the active number of JDBC connections reaches a  certain threshold, you want to reset it by running a WLST script. This is the kind of  job that automatically gets invoked in response to an alert notification, is called a  corrective action job.

Configuration management In the last chapter, we learned about configuration management and how Enterprise  Manager helps to manage configurations for IT resources of your enterprise. The  configuration management features offered by Enterprise Manager help to reduce  manual and error prone tasks; thereby freeing WebLogic administrators to focus on  more proactive maintenance activities. Many administrators use ad-hoc processes  such as spreadsheets to track assets in their IT environment, and that leads to several  issues and administrators have no way to enforce policies.  Asset tracking Enterprise Manager helps you to automate the asset tracking by collecting WebLogic  Server configuration files at regular intervals and stores them in the Configuration  Management Database  CMDB  as a part of the repository database. This helps   you to track any changes in your WebLogic configurations by allowing you to  compare two different versions of configurations for the same server or two   different servers. It also allows you to compare configuration files between two  servers in two completely different domains. For example, you can compare the  configuration between your UAT  User Acceptance Test  environment and your  production environment.  [ 75 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  Enterprise Manager collects the following configuration details for   WebLogic Servers:                Ports, resource usage, and tuning settings Deployed applications and their associated modules Java DataBase Connectivity  JDBC  data sources and connection pools Virtual hosts Java Message Service  JMS  resources Configuration of startup shutdown classes, JOLT connection pools and  Work Managers Configuration files  for example, config.xml, *-jdbc.xml,   *-jms.xml, applications   You can access the configuration management features by accessing the  Administration link from your admin server or managed server homepage. If you  want to examine the current configuration of your WebLogic Server, you can access  the Last Collected Configuration link, and you will see a similar page:  You can access the Applications, JDBC Resources, Virtual Hosts, and JMS  Resources by navigating to the respective links. The startup shutdown, jolt  connection pool, work manager settings can be accessed by selecting the  Miscellaneous link. You can view the configuration files by navigating to   the Configuration Files link.  [ 76 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 4  The configuration files are stored in the administration server for your  WebLogic Server, and hence these are collected only for the admin   server. The agent has to be locally present in the admin server host   for the config file collection.  If you want to view the history of your configuration changes, then you can navigate  by going to history. You can view and search for any configuration changes. You will  see the changes, as shown in the following screenshot:  You can further drill down to view the actual changes by clicking on the history  records. For example, when we click on the three changes that occurred for our   server, we see the following:  You can save a gold version of your WebLogic Server configurations in the software  library. This can help you track any configuration changes that may cause issues in  your production environment due to configuration drift. As we discussed earlier,  Enterprise Manager allows you to compare different versions of saved configurations  or configurations between two entirely different servers. We leave those as exercises  for you!

Policies are best practices that  you follow in your organizations. Proactive assessment of key compliance areas such  as security and configuration helps identify vulnerabilities; and indicates where best  practices are not being followed. Oracle Enterprise Manager ships with the following  out-of-the-box policies for Oracle WebLogic Server and also enables administrators  to define their own specific policies and groups.         Server Domain Administration Port is enabled Server Performance Pack is enabled Managed Server Production Mode is enabled  Enterprise Manager tracks these policies and alerts when these are violated. You can  view these violations in WebLogic Server Homepage and have notifications similar  to metric alerts.  Let us discuss how to enforce your own policy. Let us assume that your organization  does not allow the use of default port 7001 in any production WebLogic Server. We  will demonstrate by creating a custom policy.   1.  You can create custom policies by navigating to the compliance option and  then selecting the library. You will see all policies  both out of box and user  defined policy . You can select add to create a new custom policy and then  select the target type as Oracle WebLogic Server and enter the severity type,  for example, Critical, Warning, or Informational and category for example  Security, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 78 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   2.  The policy engine actually verifies by executing a SQL statement. You have   to enter the SQL statement for your custom policy. Refer to the Enterprise  Manager Extensibility Guide on the management view that you can use for the  SQL Query. You can validate the SQL statement by clicking on the validate  button as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  You have to enter the Non-Compliant and Compliant messages for the policy.  The non-compliant message is used when a policy violation alert is used. After you have successfully entered an SQL Query you have to enter the   violation condition. The violation condition can be based on a threshold  value or a where clause. The column name that you entered in the select clause is used for comparison  for a violation. You have to enter the violation condition and default value.  For example, we are checking if the port number is equal to 7001 in the   following diagram. You can change the value when enforcing the policy   with a WebLogic Server target.

In the next step, you can test the policy against a target. You can select a  target and then run the test and you will see the violation if it occurs as in   the following figure:   4.  Select a WebLogic Server where you want to test the policy.

Finally you can review the policy and confirm and create the policy. The   policy will be created and shown in the list. You can search by the target type  or name. Another way to create a policy is to export an existing policy and  make changes for a new policy and import it to Enterprise Manager. Here is an example of a XML policy that you can import to create a new user  defined policy.   <UserDefinedPolicy oms_version=”10.2.0.5.0” xmlns=”http:  www. oracle.com DataCenter ConfigStd”>     CannotUseDefaultPort7001      weblogic_j2eeserver      SELECT target_guid, value FROM esm_collection_latest WHERE property='port'                          VALUE            EQ            7001            String                   1      Informational      Capacity      Policy CannotUseDefaultPort7001 is non- compliant.      Policy CannotUseDefaultPort7001 is  compliant.              24.0          [ 81 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  Enforcing a custom policy Now that we have created a user defined policy, we will see how to enforce this  policy from a WebLogic Server. To enforce a policy you have to select the metric and  policy settings from a WebLogic Server and then go to the policy settings. You have  to select add policy from library and find the policy that you added earlier as shown  in the following figure:   EM will evaluate the policy as per the collection interval specified, and if the  violation occurs then you will see the violation in the WebLogic Server Homepage.  Service level management We introduced the concept of service level management in the last chapter. Service   Level Management will let administrators be proactive and ensure that applications  meet the performance and availability criteria agreed with your business   user community.   Think of a service as an entity that provides a business service or functionality.  For example, an application allowing the creation of an order or the searching and  viewing of an existing order. Some simpler forms of services are business functions  that are supported by protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, or SMTP.   You can use Enterprise Manager to define your services, based on applications  deployed on WebLogic Server. These services could be web application invoked  through browser or web services invoked though SOAP.  [ 82 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 4  Before we get into it, let us review some of the basic terminologies that we will use  while creating a service and using the service level management feature.                 Availability is a condition that determines whether the service is considered  to be accessible by the users or not. For example, the components hosting the  service e.g. Weblogic Server or database may be down. Service Test is a functional test defined by an IT administrator against the  service to determine whether or not the service is available and meeting the  performance standard. System is a group of underlying components, such as hosts, WebLogic Server,  databases, and on which the service runs.  Beacon is a functionality built into Oracle Management Agent that is used to  pre-record transactions or service tests. The beacons may be geographically  located across different locations to perform the service test Service Level is an operational or contractual objective between the customer  and IT for service availability and performance.  Enterprise Manager allows the creation of services based either on availability of  underlying components or based on service tests. For example, you can create a  generic service for a system component that is a collection of WebLogic Server and  the underlying database. If either the database or WebLogic Server is down, then the  service is deemed unavailable.  The second type of service is based on a service test. For example, you are running  the MedRec application or web service. You can create a service test for your  application. In this section we will discuss a service based on a service test. There  could be several types of services such as Generic Service, Aggregate Service, Forms  or Web Application based service. From a WebLogic Server perspective, we will  primarily be interested in a Generic Service or Web application service.   Creating a system A service depends upon a system. Hence before we create a service, let us create a  system. Think about the classic MedRec application offering several services e.g.  the creation of a new patient record is a service. Assume that your application is  based on an Oracle database and WebLogic Server, then you should create a system  with the WebLogic Server, database and underlying host machine. Note that the  Enterprise Manager automatically creates a system with these components when you  create a service for your application, if both Oracle database and WebLogic Server  are being monitored in the same instance by Enterprise Manager.  [ 83 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  You can manually create a service by selecting the system option from the  targets menu item and then selecting the component that you want to add  to your system. For example, the following figure shows a system named  WebLogicAndDatabaseSystem that includes two WebLogic Servers,   database and the underlying host machine.  You can view the system in the topology viewer or launch a dashboard report for  your management. A system is useful when you want to monitor the complete  application infrastructure as a single system. You will get all alerts, security  violations, service alerts, and so on, aggregated at the system level. The following  screenshot shows the homepage for the MedRec system that we are going to use for  creating a service.  [ 84 ]     This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 4  Creating a service We discussed earlier in this chapter that a service can be based on a service test or  the availability of components. You can create a generic service based on the MedRec  system that we created earlier. The problem with the services based on system  availability is that the actual performance of the service is not measured and the  service availability is based on the availability  up down status  of the components  that constitute the system. However, a service that is based on a service availability  test has at least one service test defined, that is automatically invoked by a beacon   at regular intervals and Enterprise Manager measures the perceived performance.  You can locate beacons in different geographical locations based on where your   user communities are and that will help you to measure performance based on  different locations.  To create a service based on a web application such as the MedRec application you  have to select a web application, and then add a new web application as shown in  the following diagram:      [ 85 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  You have to enter the right details, such as your system and Homepage URL for   your application and then select the availability, based on the service test as shown  in the following figure:   Then we have to enter the service tests that we want to perform. You can add one or  more tests based on the synthetic transaction that is performed by the users of the  system. For example, we want to add a test to check login into the MedRec system   as a patient or as an administrator.  You can perform these tests based on a basic single URL or a transaction  that you can record. Note that you have to use Internet Explorer to record  a transaction.  For simplicity we are just using Basic Single URL, as shown in the following figure:   [ 86 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   After that, you have to select the beacons that you want to use to invoke the service  tests. As we discussed earlier, beacons are nothing but Oracle Management Agents.  Chapter 4  In a production environment you want to locate beacons in the same  geographical location where users are located. For example, if you have  users based in North America, Europe, and Japan, then you would want  to create at least three beacons in these locations so that you can test the  service performance from these user's perspectives.  You can verify the test at this stage to make sure that you have entered the correct  URL for the web application. You can add one or more beacons if you have agent  installed on multiple locations. It is always a good idea to select multiple beacons   for your service test.

The performance metrics could be based on tests such as the warning and critical  threshold for the perceived page performance. There are several other metrics for  the service test such as DNS Time, Connect Time, Redirect Time, HTML Time,  Non-HTML Time, and so on. You can also define some performance metrics based  on your system. For example, you can add some performance metrics based on  JMX Metrics exposed by WebLogic Server, such as Average Response Time or  Invocations from your WebLogic Server.   You can add some usage metrics based on JMX Metrics exposed by WebLogic  Server. Finally, you can review the service and create the service. You can view the  service by going to service homepage. You can view the status of the service, its  performance, availability of the underlying components, service alerts, alerts for   the system components, and a summary of the tests.  [ 88 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   You can change the service rule based on your requirements. For example, you  probably do not care about the performance aspects of your application during the  weekends or you want to set blackout for service alerts for official holidays.   Chapter 4  Once you create the service tests, the beacon will automatically wake up and invoke  the service tests at regular intervals. There are several out-of-the-box reports such  as Service Dash boards and Service Test Summaries that you can use to publish  information to your stake holders. The service level management feature will keep  your services up and running and proactively monitor the services before there  are user complaints about service level violation. It is worth noting that Enterprise  Manager allows you to creating SOAP Tests for Web services and automatically  creates a service when a SOAP Test for a web service is created.  Role based access control You may have a large enterprise where you use Enterprise Manager to monitor  your complete infrastructure such as databases, application servers, packaged  applications, and so on. There are Administrators for each of the target types. As an  Administrator you are responsible for only WebLogic Server Domains and you want  to view monitor only those targets from Grid Control. How do you do that?   [ 89 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle WebLogic Server  It's simple—Enterprise Manager provides Role Based Access Control. Instead of  using the default sysman user, it is recommended that you create users for each of  the administrators and grant appropriate privileges. You have to create a user that  has access to only the targets you are interested in. Let me assume that you want to  create a user named WebLogic that has access to only a few WebLogic servers and  let us walk you through how to achieve this.  Creating an EM user and assign targets Logon as a super administrator and let us create a user named robtheadmin.  1.  You can create a user by selecting Setup menu and then selecting Create   User as in the following screenshot:  2.  Then assign the appropriate roles such as PUBLIC or any new roles that   you have defined. You can add system privileges such as Add Any Target,  View Any Target, and so on if you need to assign.

In the next step, you can select that the targets the users should have access  to. You can assign specific privileges to the target, for example Operator,  Full, or View, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  After you create the user robtheadmin, the user will have appropriate privileges.  After you logon as robtheadmin user, you will see that the homepage for WebLogic  users shows only the WebLogic Servers that assigned privileges on.  Summary We discussed all of the aspects of managing Oracle WebLogic Server. You learned  how to add a WebLogic Server into Oracle Enterprise Manager. Enterprise Manager  supports both real time and historical performance monitoring of WebLogic Server  and you can use historical data for performance trending and capacity planning. The  configuration management aspect of WebLogic Server can help you to track changes  and compare configurations between different servers and also enforce policies. You  can use service level management aspect of Enterprise Manager to create services  and measure service performance. Finally, we discussed how to use the role based  access control feature of Enterprise Manager.  In the next chapter, we will discuss managing Oracle Application Server. Enterprise  Manager supports some interesting functionalities such as provisioning and patching  of Oracle Application Server. See you at the next stop!

In this chapter, we'll learn how to manage  multiple Oracle Application Server installations using Enterprise Manager.  Oracle Application Server  OAS  is a J2EE compliant application server for Java  applications. The OAS product stack comprises of many components. On a broad  level, Oracle product stack can be categorized in different product categories. Major  product categories for OAS are as follows:              Core: It provides the core stack to run enterprise java applications.  Components included in this category are OC4J  J2EE container , OHS   Oracle HTTP Server , and WebCache. Identity management: This category provides support for Identity  management services like single-sign-on, authentication, and authorization.  Besides OC4J, this category contains components like OID  Oracle LDAP  server , DAS  Distributed Authentication System , and so on SOA suite: This category contains products that provide the integration  platform for Service Oriented Architecture. Besides OC4J this category  contains components like BPEL process manager, Enterprise Service Bus,   and so on. Content Management: This category contains products like Portal, Reports,  and Discoverer.

Monitoring and management of SOA Suite and  Identity Suite are covered in more detail in Chapters 6 and 8 respectively. But as we  saw that all other suites contain components from core suite, knowing about core  suite management will be very helpful in understanding the management of   other suites.   We'll start with the target model and discovery process for Oracle Application Server.  After that we'll look at the tasks that an Oracle Application Server Administrator  needs to perform; we'll show how Enterprise Manager can make those tasks easier.  We'll also provide some recommendations, best practices on performing those tasks  through Enterprise Manager.  Discovery and Target Model  To discover Oracle Application Server, Enterprise Manager Agent needs to be  installed on the same host as the application server. There are two scenarios for the  application server's discovery:        The agent is installed after the installation of the application server: in this  scenario, nothing needs to be done for the application server's discovery  besides installing the agent, the agent discovers the existing application  server during installation. In Chapter 2, Installing Enterprise Manager Grid  Control, we learned how to install a new agent. During the installation of an  we learned how to install a new agent. During the installation of an  agent, the user is prompted to provide details of Oracle Management Server;  using those details, the agent uploads details about the newly discovered  application server targets. The application server is installed after agent installation: in this scenario,  you will need to trigger the discovery process from Enterprise Manager  Console to discover the application servers that got installed after agent  installation. For this scenario, click on targets in the top menu bar and select  Middleware. On this page, you will see all the middleware targets and the  option to discover new middleware targets.

Chapter 5  On UNIX servers the user-ID with which you install agent, and the   user-ID with which you have installed Oracle Application Server,  should belong to the same UNIX user group. This is to ensure that the  agent process has read permissions on all configuration files for Oracle  Application Server.  Let's look into the application server target model. In the introduction to this chapter,  we saw that the Oracle Application Server product has many components, Enterprise  Manager provides out-of-the-box target types for each component type of Application  Server stack. Some core target types for Oracle Application Server product are:                  Application Server Farm: Application Server Farm is a group of   application server instances, we'll use Application Server Farm and   Farm interchangeably in this chapter Application Server Instance: Application Server Instance is group of  components that are running from the same set of binaries Application Server Cluster: Application Server Cluster is group of  components of the same type and is used for providing High- Availability  and load- balancing support, for example cluster of OC4J OC4J: J2EE compliant container to run Java applications Oracle HTTP Server: HTTP listener for routing traffic to J2EE container WebCache: Component for caching HTTP traffic  The Oracle Application Server target model also keeps the associations and hierarchy  between various targets, like the association between Application Server Instance  and OC4J within the Application Server Instance.   [ 97 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle Application Server  These associations are very helpful when multiple Application Server Farms,  Application Server Instances and components, are managed from the same  Enterprise Manager. Users can see a hierarchical and topological view of all the  application server targets. The following screenshot shows one such view of all   of the application server targets:  Tasks for Oracle Applications Server   Administrator Let's look at the tasks that need to be performed by an Oracle Application Server  Administrator and how the Enterprise Manager features help in performing that task.  At the end of each task we'll provide some pointers to explore the features defined.   We'll start with the first task that is installation.  [ 98 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  Provisioning Whenever a new application has to be deployed on a new Application Server or  the capacity of an existing application is augmented, the administrator needs to  provision Oracle Application Servers. Most of such provisioning activity is repetitive  in nature and can be automated. We learned about provisioning a framework and  deployment procedures in Chapter 1, Enterprise Manager Grid Control.  Enterprise Manager provides out-of-the-box deployment procedures to provision  Oracle Application Server. These deployment procedures support following three  scenarios for provisioning:           Provisioning from installable software:  This scenario covers first time  installation of software. This scenario is more common when building a   new system from scratch. Gold image creation:  After the first installation from installable software,  administrator performs some configuration on the software, and applies  some patches on the software. The gold image of such a system can be  created and saved for subsequent installations.  Provisioning from reference environment or gold image: This scenario  is more common when expanding the capacity of an existing system or  building a new system by cloning an existing installation.   The out-of-the-box procedures provided by Enterprise Manager contain a set  of steps that install clone software as per best practices suggested by Oracle.  These best practices are actually guidelines and often need some environment  specific customizations. Administrators can customize out-of-the-box deployment  procedures to achieve such customizations on top of recommended best practices.  Recommendation: To customize out-of-the-box deployment procedure,  create a copy of the deployment procedures and add customizations in  the copy. Use the new deployment procedure for provisioning of Oracle  Application Server. Recommendation: Create a gold image for Oracle Application Server  and save it in the software library. For all new provisioning of Oracle  Application Server, use this gold image. Whenever new patches are  applied, build a new gold image.  Enterprise Manager provides deployment procedures for provisioning of Oracle  Application Server versions 10.1.2.0.2, 10.1.3, and 10.1.3.1. It also provides  deployment procedures for Forms and Reports 9.0.4.

We will use a deployment  procedure to extend 10.1.3 cluster by cloning an existing server. For this exercise you  will need the following:        A cluster of two 10.1.3 application servers, the application servers and the  cluster should be discovered and monitored by Enterprise Manager: A host to clone the new application server. This host should meet the  pre-requisites for the application server installation. This host should be  discovered and monitored as a target from current Enterprise Manager.   You will need to install an agent on this host to achieve this.  After this setup, Click on the Middleware tab, and you will see a page similar to the  one shown next. You will see a cluster and two servers under the cluster.   To start the cloning of the application server, go to the Application Server  Provisioning Procedures page from the Deployments tab. You will see a page,  which was shown earlier. From that page, select the radio button next to the  Application Server Deployment 10.1.3 and click on Schedule deployment. This will  start an interview wizard for the cloning operation. On the first screen, you can select  the reference environment or the software library as the source.

Besides the monitoring, the administrator  also needs to proactively look for possible bottlenecks or whether there is the  need  to add more capacity.  As most of the applications are built with a distributed multi-tier architecture to  monitor the applications, the Administrator needs to monitor all the tiers, and all   the components on which the application depends.   In the following sections, we'll look at the various monitoring tasks for the  application server administrator.   Monitoring availability  When it comes to monitoring, the most important metric is the availability metric.  Availability metric defines whether the monitored target is available for serving  application requests or not. Enterprise Manager uses status metric of application  server targets to monitor availability.   Oracle Application Server components provide status information, and that is  collected by Enterprise Manager, and is used to show the status of the component on  console. Targets like Oracle Application Server Farm, cluster, and instance, represent  a group of Application Server Components and do not have status metric. Status of  such targets is shown as the aggregate status of all components.  We learnt in the earlier chapters that Enterprise Manager repository keeps all the  historical metric data. Historical status data can be used to find the availability of  Oracle Application Server target for a given period of time.  How to use this feature To see the current availability of a target, go to the target homepage. The following  screenshot shows the homepage of an Oracle Application Server Target, where the  Status of application server and Components is displayed. This page also shows the  availability of Application Server Target for the last 24 hours:  [ 106 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  You can click on the Availability link and on the next page you can see the  availability for an other period of time such as last 7 days or 31 days or some   other customized time range.  The following screenshot shows the availability of the OC4J target for the last seven  days. You can view the availability for any other duration using the View Data   drop-down list.

The Application server administrator  can look at the current data and historical data to perform A trend analysis that can  help in identifying possible bottlenecks and capacity enhancement needs.   There are some metrics that are common across the application server components  and represent the system resource usage like the CPU usage, and the memory usage  by component, and so on. Besides the common resource metrics, there are lots of  component specific metrics. Some useful component specific metrics for some core  components are given below. For a complete list of metrics for all the application  server components please refer to the Enterprise Manager documentation.            OC4J: Requests per second for application, Average Response time for  application, active JDBC connections for each datasource, Requests per  second for each webservice Forms: Number of forms sessions, Total memory used by all forms sessions Reports: Average response time to process a request, Number of failed jobs Oracle HTTP Server: Request throughput, Average Response time, and  Average Response size  How to use this feature To use this feature, go to the target homepage, for most common metrics you will  see some performance tabs on the homepage. The following screenshot shows the  Performance tab for the OC4J target. From this page you can see the links for other  performance pages like top servlets, top jsps, and so on.  [ 108 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  If you don't find a metric on the Performance tab and from links in the performance  tab, don't loose your heart. Go to the homepage and click on the All Metrics link,  you will find all of the metrics for the target there. You can find the current, as well  as the historical data for all the metrics.   Applications performance monitoring Other than monitoring the performance and health of individual Oracle Application  Server components, the system administrator needs to monitor the health and  performance of the application that is using multiple Oracle Application Server  components. Most frequently, multi-tiered applications depend on multiple  Application Server components and some non-Application Server components. To  effectively monitor an application, the administrator needs to monitor a few things  that are listed in the following sections. Monitoring of Application Infrastructure By Application Infrastructure, we mean all of the components that provide runtime  support for an application. The administrator should monitor all such components  collectively, as performance availability issues on one of the components can affect  application performance  availability. For example, a J2EE application runs on OC4J,  persists data in an Oracle database, and traffic to the application is routed through  an HTTP server. If the HTTP server goes down, then for all practical purposes, the  application is also down. Enterprise Manager provides a construct system to group related targets. Enterprise  Manager also provides a construct service, this service can be used to define and  monitor the Service Level Agreements for a system.  To monitor an application, administrator can define a system that groups all  the related targets and can define service for this system. Using this, a service  administrator can monitor the availability of application infrastructure. A system  and service can be created manually by adding all the related targets to a system.   It sounds like a lot of work, but Enterprise Manager provides support for  creating a system and service automatically. Enterprise Manager introspects the  application configuration to find out all the related targets for the application, and  creates a system and service. For example, if there is an application that runs on  a cluster of OC4Js and persists data in two databases, and traffic is routed to this  application through an HTTP server, Enterprise Manager can look at the application  configuration and build a system that groups the OC4Js, HTTP server and databases.

To create a system for an application,  select the application and click on the Create Service button, on the next page you  will be asked to provide a service name. The following screenshot shows this page.  On this page provide a service name and click on OK, it will create a service with the  name you provided and a system by the same name with _system appended to it.  The following screenshot shows the homepage of a service, where it shows the  availability of service that represents the application infrastructure. Under the Key  Component Service, you can see the status of all of the components behind this  service, you can also see alerts for all of the components in one place.

The administrator can find such issues proactively and can get the correct sequence  of events that led to the issue, if they can record typical user actions and replay it  every fixed interval, and record the outcome of those actions. Enterprise Manager provides a construct test that can be used to record user actions  and it can be repeated from different beacons. Beacon is just a regular Enterprise  Manager Agent that is converted to act as a beacon. You can put one beacon in each  of the geographical locations where your user community resides and schedule the  tests to be executed.

Thresholds and notifications for metrics We learned in Chapter 3 that for each metric, you could set warning and critical  thresholds. As an administrator, you will need to define these thresholds for various  metrics. Enterprise Manager Console provides an interface, using which, you could  set up the warning and critical thresholds.  You would like to be notified of some of the critical alerts; to achieve this, you  need to define for which metrics you want to receive the notification, and what the  notification mechanism is. How to use this feature To define the thresholds for a target, go to the target homepage and click on Metrics  and Policy Settings. From this page you can update the thresholds for each metric. To set up notifications methods, go to the Enterprise Manager homepage, and   click on the Setup link in the top-right corner, on the subsequent page click   on the Notification Methods link. From this page, you can configure your  notification methods. To define on what metrics you want to receive notifications, click on the Preferences  link on the Enterprise Manager homepage. On the next page, you can see the  Notification Rules link and using this, you can configure for which metrics you   want to receive notifications and what the notification mechanism is.  Configuration management Once the Application Server targets are installed and the monitoring setup is  completed, the next important task for Oracle Application Server Administrator is  Configuration management.  Enterprise Manager collects lots of important configuration parameters for Oracle  Application Server targets. For example, some important configuration parameters  that are collected for OC4J target are:         Memory related: starting heap size, maximum heap size, and so on Network related: port range for AJP HTTP RMI JDBC Resources: name, JNDI Location, JDBC driver, maximum connection,  minimum connection, and so on  [ 114 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Enterprise Manager also collects the configuration files for Oracle Application   Server targets. Some of the important configuration files collected for an HTTP  Server target are:  Chapter 5           httpd.conf  mod_oc4j.conf  ssl.conf  mime.types  With this data you can perform tasks discussed in the next sections.  Configuration change tracking Enterprise Manager provides the configuration change tracking feature, using   this, you can see the complete configuration change history for the Application   Server target. You can use this information in various ways, to identify any  unauthorized configuration changes, or to co-relate performance changes with  configuration changes. How to use this feature  From any OC4J homepage click on Administration tab, from that tab click on the  Last Collected Configuration link; you will see the last collected configuration  for that OC4J target. You can see configuration categorized in different tabs. The  following screenshot shows such a page:  [ 115 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle Application Server  From this page you can go to configuration change history by clicking the  Configuration History link. The following screenshot shows one such page:  This page allows you the flexibility of seeing all of the configuration changes or the  configuration changes for a certain time window, you can use Change Discovered  after before fields to define such a window. The number under History Records  shows the changes for that target. You can click the number link and on the next  page, you will see the exact change made to the target configuration.   Configuration compliance For every product there are some configuration guidelines by the product  vendor, besides that every organization has it's own configuration guidelines. The  Administrator needs to find out which targets don't conform to the guidelines. We  learnt in Chapter 3, Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems, that policy is a  construct to define such rules or guidelines, and policies can be evaluated against a  target to check for conformance.   Enterprise Manager provides some out-of-the-box policies for Application Server  targets and some of them are:           HTTP Server: HostNameLookup should be set to 'off' HTTP Server: Directory indexing should be disabled OC4J: Datasource passwords should not be in clear text WebCache: WebCache binaries should not have setuid bit set  [ 116 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  Besides these policies, you can also define new policies. All the policies are saved in  the policy library, you can decide on what policies should be enforced. How to use this feature From the Enterprise Manager homepage, select the Compliance tab. On the  Compliance tab you can see the policy violation for all the targets under the  violations sub-tab. You can filter violations by a particular target or target type. The  following screenshot shows all of the violations for OC4J targets in a datacenter. It  shows the name of OC4J, the policy that is violated, category of policy, most recent  violation and for how long the policy is violated. It also shows the compliance  score for a target that reflects the percentage of policies that a given target conforms  to. From the Library sub-tab, you can see the library of all policies, and from the  Associations tab, you can find out which policy is enforced on which target.  All such violations of policies can also be sent out as notifications. In the previous  section, you learnt how to set notification rules for the metric alerts, the same page  can be used to define notification rules for the policy violations.  Configuration comparison We learnt in Chapter 3, Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems, that  configuration comparison is a great tool for troubleshooting. It's very common that  something works in one environment and doesn't work in another environment. To  troubleshoot such cases, administrators compare configuration of one environment  with an other.

The administrator needs to know the versions and current patches applied for all  Application Servers. Using this information, the administrator can download all  the required patches and can apply such patches on the application servers. The  administrator also needs to check for new patches with regularity, which is a   time-consuming process.  Enterprise Manager has an automated patching solution for Oracle Application  Servers, where Enterprise Manager keeps on checking and downloading all required  patches from “Oracle My Support” site. In Chapter 1, Enterprise Manager Grid Control,  we learnt that Enterprise Manager keeps the inventory of all of the software and  patches. This inventory information is used by Enterprise Manager to download   only the needed patches.  Enterprise Manager also provides the deployment procedures to patch Oracle  Application Server.   How to use the feature The first step is to configure Enterprise Manager for getting patch advisory and  patches from My Oracle Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for My Oracle Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for  Oracle Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for Oracle Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for  Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for Support site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for  site. Patch advisory is a list of suggested patches for  all Oracle Products that is published by Oracle periodically. Using this configuration,  Enterprise Manager can connect to My Oracle Support site and download the My Oracle Support site and download the  Oracle Support site and download the Oracle Support site and download the  site and download the  required data. For that configuration, click on the Setup link on the Enterprise  Manager homepage, on the next page click on Patching Setup. On this page, you will  need to provide the credentials for My Oracle Support account. Enterprise Manager  uses these credentials to authenticate for My Oracle Support and download patches.  The following screenshot shows the page where you can configure these credentials:   [ 120 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  After this setup, Enterprise Manager can periodically connect to My Oracle Support  site and download the latest patch advisory. The patch advisory has a list of  recommended patches for all Oracle products, going through the whole list and  finding out which patches your datacenter needs, could be time consuming and you  could miss out on some of the patches. Enterprise Manager evaluates patch advisory  with the inventory of Oracle products in the datacenter and finds out what Oracle  products need to be patched.  These details are listed on the Enterprise Manager homepage; the following  screenshot shows this data. You can see those details under the Critical Patch  Advisories for Oracle Homes section. In this illustration, you see that 15 Oracle  Homes need to be patched.

To find this out, you need to click on the link next to the Patch advisories  and you will see the page as shown next:  This page shows a filtered view of the detailed patch advisory, it shows only the  patches applicable to the products that you have in your datacenter. It also shows  the number of Oracle Homes where these patches need to be applied. The right-most  column in the table provides the link to Oracle Home, where a particular patch needs  to be applied. Once you click on that link you will see a page as shown next:  [ 122 ]     This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 5  On this page, you see which Oracle Homes need to be patched and the host where  these Oracle Homes are installed. You will see many blanks on this page such as  Status, Downloaded, Created On, and so on, because so far we have downloaded  only patch advisories and not the actual patches.  At this point you know about all the patches that you need to apply to stay   up-to-date with the recommendations from Oracle. You also know the Oracle   Homes and hosts where these patches are applied. It's time to apply the patches.  Enterprise Manager provides a deployment procedure to apply the patches on  Oracle Application Servers, using this, you can apply one or more patches on one  or more application server targets. In the next few steps, we'll see how to use that  deployment procedure. To use the Application Server deployment procedure, click on the Deployments tab  on the Enterprise Manager homepage. From the Deployments tab, click on the link,  Patching through Deployment Procedures, this takes you to a page that lists   various deployment procedures. The following screenshot shows such a page:  [ 123 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle Application Server  From this page, select the radio button next to Patch Application Server and click  on the Schedule Deployment button on the top of the table. You will see a page as  shown next:  On this page you need to provide the staging location where this patch will be  staged. The patch will be applied from this staging location. You will need to select  the patches you want to apply, to do so click on the Add button under Application  Server updates. On the next page, you can choose to use a patch that is already  available in the software library or choose a patch from My Oracle Support. In this  illustration, we'll go with the My Oracle Support option. The following screenshot  shows this page:  [ 124 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   On this page, you can enter the details to search the patches that you want to apply.  For this illustration we used a patch number that we got from the patch advisory,  Oracle Fusion Middleware as product family, Oracle Application Server as Product  and Linux X86 as platform. Once you click on the GO button, Enterprise Manager  will search My Oracle Support to get more details on patches that meet search  parameters. In this case, the search returns with only one patch. The following   screenshot shows the page after performing a search on My Oracle Support:  Chapter 5  Once you have made the choice through the Select check box, you can click on the  Select button. You will be taken back to the first page of the deployment procedure,  and your screen will look like the figure shown next:   [ 125 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Oracle Application Server  There are a few more things to see before we go to the next step, this page provides  an option to upgrade the Opatch. Opatch is a tool provided by Oracle to apply  the patches. Enterprise Manager can also upgrade the Opatch as part of patching,  if required. You can also choose to blackout the target during patching to avoid  unnecessary alerts if the target has to be stopped during patching. Once you click on Next, you will see Step 2 of this flow where you can add the  targets that you want to apply the patches to. The following screenshot shows   that page:  On the next few pages, you will be prompted to provide some more details, like  host credentials for the hosts where product to be patched are running. You will  also be asked to provide a unique name for this patching operation—using that, you  can track the status of the operation later on. Once you go through these steps this  patching operation will be scheduled, where Enterprise Manager will download the  patch from My Oracle Support and will apply that patch on a selected target.

These were primarily used  to build client-server applications. However, Forms Services and Report Services  components of Oracle Application Servers allowed users to deploy Oracle Forms   and Reports in the web and therefore, Oracle Forms and Reports became very widely  deployed applications in many organizations. Also, many packaged applications  such as Oracle eBusiness Suite use Oracle Forms and Reports. In the previous  chapter we learnt about the management of Oracle Application Server.  In this chapter, we will learn about the management of Oracle Forms and Reports  Services and Forms applications from Grid Control. We will discuss the following:         Architecture of Oracle Forms and Reports Server  Monitoring of Forms Server, Reports Server, and Forms applications  Cloning and provisioning of Oracle Forms and Reports Server.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Forms and Reports Services and Applications  Architecture of Oracle Forms and   Reports Services Oracle Forms and Reports Services run on a middle-tier instance of Oracle  Application Server. Forms Servlets and Reports Servlets are actually Java servlet  applications that run inside an OC4J container, and facilitate communication  between the client browser and the Forms Reports process that run in the   middletier server. The following figure depicts the architecture for   Forms Services:  HTTP Listener  OC4J   Servlet engine   Forms Listener  Servlet  Forms Runtime  Process  Internet  l l  a w e r i F   e d s   t n e  i  i l  C  l l  a w e r i F   e d s   r e v r e S  i  HTTP HTTPS  The Forms Listener services acts as broker between client browser and Forms  Runtime Process where Forms applications are deployed. The Forms Server   manages the application logic and connections to the database on behalf of   the client.   The Reports Services have a similar architecture. You may have both Forms and  Reports Services deployed as a part of the same middle-tier instance.  You can use Oracle Application Server Control to manage Oracle Forms and  Reports Services. Note that you need Oracle Management Agent to manage Oracle  Forms and Reports Services with Oracle Application Server Control. You can use  Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control to manage your Oracle Forms and Reports  Services. This will help you to monitor your entire application infrastructure from  a single management console. You will get several additional benefits such as  historical metrics for your server, service level management for Forms applications,  and deployment automation for your application server environment.

In this section, we will learn about  discovery and monitoring of Forms and Reports Services.  Chapter 6  Discovery of Oracle Forms and   Reports Server In the last chapter, we discussed the discovery of Oracle Application Server. We  learnt about the Oracle Application Server discovery process. If Oracle Forms and  Reports Services are installed with a middle-tier instance of Oracle Application  Server then those are automatically discovered by Enterprise Manager Grid Control.  The following screenshot shows the homepage of an Oracle Application Server  instance that has Forms and Reports Services running. You can monitor the health  of Forms and Reports Services and OC4J instances where these services are running.  Also you may use Oracle HTTP Server or Web cache running infront Forms Servers  and you can monitor all of them together. This helps you to diagnose if your Forms  and Reports applications are running slowly or not responding.

You can get a historical view of the availability of the Oracle Forms  Server. If you want to make any configuration changes to your Forms Server then  you can access the Oracle Application Server Control from the Forms homepage,   as shown in the following figure.   You can also take the benefits of EM Job system to recycle Forms Server or  application server. For example, should you want to recycle your Forms Server   every weekend then you can do that.  Setting the metric thresholds Similar to the other targets such as Oracle Application Server and Oracle WebLogic  Server, you can implement a proactive monitoring for Forms Server through   setting the metric thresholds and getting notified when an alert is raised. You   can set Warning Threshold and Critical Threshold for several metrics such as  Status, Total CPU %  usage, Total Memory %  usage, Total number of users,   and so on, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 132 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 6  For example, you can set a threshold that states that you want to get a warning alert  when the number of users reaches 50, and get a critical alert when the number of  concurrent users reaches 75. If you want to set up a notification mechanism, such  as an email, then you can do so. You can refer to our discussions on setting up  notifications mechanisms in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic Server, and   those same steps apply here.  Managing Reports Server You can monitor the health of Reports Server and Report Jobs from Enterprise  Manager Grid Control. You get the benefits such as historical performance data and  proactive monitoring from Grid Control. As we have discussed earlier, Grid Control  does not provide any support for making configuration changes for Reports Server.  The following screenshot shows the homepage for the Reports Server.  [ 133 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Forms and Reports Services and Applications  You can get both the real time and historical view of the performance data for the  Reports Server and Reports Jobs submitted running on the Reports Server. For  example, you can get metrics such as CPU and memory usage for the Reports Server  and average response time, and so on. The historical metrics enables you to perform  a trend analysis for your Reports Server and plan for future growth. Similarly, Grid  Control provides you both real time and historical data about the job load, completed  job, and potential run-away jobs, as shown in the following screenshot. This helps  you to take the appropriate action.  Setting the metric thresholds You can set the metric thresholds for a few critical metrics that you want to proactively  monitor. One of the key metrics is monitoring the failed Reports. You do not want  your user communities to be upset with the failed Reports. The failure of Report Jobs  could be due to problems in the Reports Server, the host, or the underlying database,  and you would want to be notified before it becomes a real problem. Grid Control  allows you to set a threshold for a failed job ratio and an alert is raised as soon as the  threshold is raised. For example, we have set the Warning Threshold and Critical  Threshold as 25% and 33% respectively in the following screenshot.

Monitoring Forms applications The most interesting feature of Forms Management using Grid Control is to perform  Service Level Management for Forms applications. You can create model Forms  application target in Grid Control and use that to monitor your Forms application.  For example, you have built a custom application such as an HR, Finance, or  Customer Service and deployed that to the web. You can use Grid Control to  monitor the performance of Forms application. You may remember our discussion   in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic Server, where we created a web application  for a custom Java application. You can use a similar approach to define, monitor,  and playback a specific flow of your Forms application, where each flow is recorded  as a single Forms transaction. Simply put, a Forms transaction consists of a set of  user actions within a single application when using Forms, for example, querying an  employee record. Grid Control allows you to record multiple Forms transactions by  using the playback recorder that automatically records the Forms actions.  There are two aspects to Forms transaction monitoring and end-user performance.  The Forms transaction monitoring helps you to track down the performance of a  specific Forms transaction and verify whether you are meeting the Service Level  Agreement  SLA  for the transaction.   [ 135 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Forms and Reports Services and Applications  However, the end-user monitoring feature allows you to measure the response time  data, as experienced by end-users while they are performing a Forms operation. Grid  Control helps you to measure the total response time, server time, and the database  time for Forms operations such as Commit, Query, Runform, Callform, Newform, and  Openform. This can help you to identify bottlenecks in your application. Grid Control  also helps you to define a watch list for the most important Forms actions for your  application and monitor and view the response metrics of those critical operations.  The end-user performance monitoring requires the Forms application to  be front-ended with Oracle HTTP Server, Oracle Web cache, and Apache  HTTP Server. If you want to really monitor the real user performance,  Oracle Real User Experience Insight Product is recommended.  To enable Forms transactions monitoring you have to perform the following system:                  Configure your Windows client Configure SSL certificate for your Enterprise Manager Enable Forms transaction recording in your Forms Server Build a system or redundancy group that includes the Forms Server,   Oracle HTTP Server, Web cache, and OC4J system that is used for your   Form application  Create a Forms application Create one or more Forms transactions Associate one or more beacons for performing the service test  The Forms transaction monitoring and end user performance monitoring  only works in specific versions of Oracle Forms, please check the  certification list of the Grid Control documentation for your version.

You will probably use this client to record the Forms  transaction. This client needs to be configured with proper Java permissions to  record and playback the Forms transaction. You have to ensure that your user home  directory has a .java.policy file with permissions to access Forms application  running on each Oracle Application Server. The following should be the contents   of .java.policy file:   grant codeBase " http:  formsServerHost:port forms java *» {permission java.security.SecurityPermission                                        «putProviderProperty.SunJSSE»; };  If you are using Forms application as a part of Oracle eBusiness suite then the  contents of the .java.policy file should look as follows:   grant codeBase "http:  appsHost:appsPort OA_JAVA oracle apps fnd  jar *" {   permission java.security.SecurityPermission                                         "putProviderProperty.SunJSSE"; };  Ensure that you replace the URL with the correct host and port name for   your application.  Configure SSL certificate You have correctly configured the SSL certificate if you are using any of the following:         If you are using a secured Grid Control to record the Forms transaction, then  you have to ensure that the certificate used by Grid Control is trusted by  Oracle Jinitiator or Java Plug-In that you use to run Forms application If you use secured Forms application, then you have to ensure that the  certificate used by the Forms application is added to the Oracle Management  Agent that plays back the Forms transaction.  Refer to the Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control Advanced Configuration Guide for  detailed instructions on how to perform these steps.

We have also learnt about system  modeling in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic Server.  You must include these components as of part of your Forms application or as part  of a key Redundancy Group. The Redundancy Group for HTTP Server is referred to  as the HTTP Server HA Group.  Creating Forms application Creation of Forms application is similar to web application. You can create a Forms  application Target by going to Services page and selecting Forms Target from the  Add drop-down list, as shown in the following screenshot.

If you are planning  to use the Forms application monitoring from Grid Control extensively, then you  should select a good user-friendly name.   Chapter 6  Then you can select the availability, either based on the system or the service test. In  the next step we will record a service test for Forms monitoring.   You have to use Internet Explorer to record a service test. The transaction  recorder will be downloaded automatically from the OMS on your first  attempt to record a transaction. The recorder requires some Microsoft  libraries to be installed on your computer and it will be downloaded  automatically. You must have Internet access to download these libraries  from the Microsoft website.

You have to enter the test name and  collection frequency before you start recording a transaction. Note that collection  frequency is the frequency at which the beacon wakes up to perform the Forms test.  You have to click on Go and then enter the URL for the Forms Server. It will launch  JInitiator or Java plug-in and then the Forms will be loaded. You have to login  to the application and perform the steps that you want to record. After you close  the window the data will be captured. After you have successfully recorded the  transaction, you have to select the beacons, performance metrics, and usage   metrics. We leave those as an exercise.   There are a few things that you have to make sure for Form Server recorder. You  have to ensure that you have specified the correct Forms Server URL.

You can specify some  Advanced Properties such as Forms Module Path. This parameter specifies the  absolute path of the location of the Forms binaries on the server host. This is typically  useful when you record a transaction against one Forms Server and then playback  the same against another server.  Chapter 6  In order for Forms Transaction Recording to work successfully you have  to enable Forms Transaction monitoring. You can do so by accessing the  Monitoring Configuration link from the Forms Server Home page and  selecting Enable Transaction Monitoring.   Once you have successfully created the service test and selected the beacon, the service  test will be executed, and you can monitor the performance of your application. You  can enforce the correct service level rule and if you get a service level violation, then  an alert will be raised. You can create several reports such as Service Dash Board  report for reporting purposes. We leave that as an exercise for you.

The Grid Control deployment procedures help you  to clone a test environment to production or vice versa. This greatly automates  a lot of manual and error prone tasks. Grid Control provides Forms and Reports  Provisioning Deployment Procedure that supports cloning and configuration of  Oracle Application Server Forms and Reports Services installations.  Note that Forms and Reports Services install type allows you to install and configure  Forms and Reports Services without having to install and configure all of Oracle  Application Server 10g. If you use Oracle Application Server Forms and Reports  Services installed as a part of Oracle Infrastructure, then you cannot use this  deployment procedure. Grid Control supports cloning of Oracle Forms and   Reports Services either from a reference install or from a gold image.  Only a limited number of platforms and versions are certified for  provisioning Forms and Reports Services. Check the certification matrix  with Oracle support to verify whether your platform version is certified.  Also, you have to make sure that both the source and target hosts are  managed by Oracle Management Agent 10.2.0.4 or higher.  Also, you have to remember that the Forms and Reports Provisioning Deployment  Procedure does not support cloning of Oracle Application Server Web Cache to  machines with virtual host names.  You have to perform the following tasks to clone Oracle Forms and Reports   Services software:     Select the Deployment procedures from the Deployment procedure   Manager section by navigating to Deployments tab and then selecting the  Forms and Reports Provisioning Deployment procedure, as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 142 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 6        Select the Forms and Reports Provisioning deployment procedure you want  to run, and click on Schedule Deployment….  You can select the source from which to clone and the destination host  machines on which to clone Forms and Reports Services, and schedule the  deployment operation.      You can review the page and the click Finish to schedule the deployment.

Also Grid Control will automatically  discover the newly installed Forms and Reports Servers for monitoring purpose.   Summary Oracle Forms and Reports are a very popular framework to build enterprise  applications on. Oracle Forms and Reports Server run on top of Oracle Application  Server. Forms and Reports Services are automatically discovered when Oracle  Application Server is discovered. Grid Control allows monitoring of Forms and  Reports Server and Forms applications. You can use Forms Transactions and  beacons to manage the service level for Forms applications. Grid Control also helps  automation of Forms and Reports Server by providing a deployment procedure.  In the next chapter, we'll be learning about the management and monitoring of  BPEL Process Manager, that is used for orchestration of services of Service Oriented  Architecture. We'll also learn how Enterprise Manager helps in monitoring the  business processes that are executed using BPEL Process Manager.

Most of the middleware vendors provide some platform or product suite for  implementing cost effective Service Oriented Architectures. These product suites   are also used for flexible and faster integration of disparate systems hence some  times these are referred to as integration suites.  Oracle Application Server SOA suite is one of the leading integration platforms in  the market. SOA suite contains many components. In this chapter, we'll focus on the  management of a core component of SOA suite and that is BPEL process.  In this book, we'll use the term BPEL PM for Oracle BPEL process manager.   In this chapter, we will cover the:              Introduction of BPEL process manager. We'll introduce you to BPEL PM,  typical usage, and deployment. Discovery of BPEL process manager. BPEL PM can run on all major J2EE  containers like OC4J, WebLogic, and WebSphere. We'll cover the discovery  of BPEL PM on all major J2EE containers. Monitoring of BPEL Process Manager and BPEL processes. Configuration management for BPEL process manager. Besides the  configuration management of BPEL PM, we'll also provide an overview   of configuration management for business processes implemented as   BPEL executables.

We will also cover  provisioning of business process implemented as BPEL executables.  Provisioning and patching for BPEL PM running on OC4J. Best practices for the management of BPEL PM.  Introducing BPEL Process Manager Business Process Execution Language  BPEL  is fast becoming the standard for  business process orchestration. Using BPEL, one can define interactions between  various web-services. Most of the major software vendors like Oracle, IBM, and  Microsoft support BPEL standard and have products compliant to BPEL standards.   BPEL process manager is a product from Oracle that is a container for the execution  of BPEL executables. Users can deploy the BPEL definitions on a BPEL process  manager, and the BPEL process manager takes care of runtime tasks like scheduling,  load balancing, failover, persistence, and so on.  In this book, we will use the term BPEL process for business process definition  defined using BPEL constructs, and BPEL PM for BPEL process manager.  BPEL PM is a Java based product that can run on top of a J2EE container. BPEL PM  is certified to run on top of OC4J, WebLogic, and WebSphere J2EE containers. BPEL  PM also needs a database for storing the state of each BPEL process invocation. This  database is generally referred to as dehydration store. BPEL PM uses Oracle database  as dehydration store. Just like any other J2EE application, traffic is routed to BPEL  PM through the HTTP gateway or load balancer.

The  discovery process is different for BPEL PM on different J2EE containers.  BPEL Process Manager running on OC4J  We learned in Chapter 5, Managing Oracle Application Server, that Oracle Application  Server and components of Oracle Application Server like OC4J are automatically  discovered as part of agent installation. In case Application Server is installed after  the agent installation, you will need to discover application server by triggering the  discovery process from the console.  BPEL PM on OC4J also gets discovered as part of an application server and OC4J  discovery. In case the BPEL PM is added to an already discovered Application  server, you will need to re-discover the Application Server. You can re-discovery  an application server by starting the discovery process again on that host. You may  want to quickly revisit the discovery section for application server in Chapter 5,  Managing Oracle Application Server. Once the BPEL PM is discovered, you will see it on the Middleware tab along  with other application server components. The following screenshot shows the  Middleware tab where BPEL PM is listed along with other components:  [ 148 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 7  At this point, a BPEL target is discovered and some basic metrics like status and  so on are getting collected. But to get more advanced metrics, you will need to go  through two more steps. We will discuss those steps in the following sections.  Monitoring configuration  In this step, we'll provide some credentials to Enterprise Manager. Using those  credentials, Enterprise Manager can mine the data in the dehydration store, or can  make Remote Method Invocation  RMI  calls to BPEL PM during runtime to collect  some very useful metrics.   To do this configuration, go to BPEL PM homepage by clicking on the BPEL PM  link on the Middleware tab. Once on the homepage, click on the Monitoring  Configuration link. This will take you to the page, as shown next:  [ 149 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  On this page you need to provide:         Username and password for BPEL PM: Provide the credentials that you use  for login on to the BPEL Console. By default, Username is pre-populated to  oc4jadmin. BPEL repository host, port, SID, username, and password:  All of these fields  except password are pre-populated. Enterprise Manager gets values for these  fields by looking into the BPEL PM configuration, please make sure that  those values are captured correctly.  Once you have provided these values, click on the OK button to save these values.  After this configuration you will need to do some more steps on agent side.  Agent configuration  To get finer details the agent needs to make RMI calls to a BPEL runtime, for that,  some JAR files are needed in the agent class path, these JAR files are in Oracle Home  of BPEL server, we just need to make entries in agent class path. To do so:  1.  Log on to the BPEL server host, go to the Oracle Home for the agent and   open file sysman config emd.properties. In this file ensure the following JAR entries are added in the beginning of  CLASSPATH property:  2.   a.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME opmn lib optic.jar b.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME bpel lib orabpel.jar c.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME bpel lib orabpel-common.jar d.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME bpel lib orabpel-thirdparty.jar e.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME j2ee home oc4jclient.jar f.  $BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME j2ee home j2ee_1.3.01.jar  3.  Replace BPEL_SERVER_ORACLE_HOME with the actual path of Oracle Home   where BPEL Process Manager is installed.  4.  Restart the agent, to restart the agent use emctl command in the bin   directory of agent Oracle Home.

To check if everything  is fine, please visit the Processes tab on BPEL PM homepage. You should see the  BPEL process deployed on your BPEL PM. If you don't see the BPEL processes,  click on the Refresh button and you will see the BPEL processes, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 7  Congratulations!! At this point you have configured your BPEL PM target on OC4J  for advanced metrics.  BPEL Process Manager running on WebLogic Before discovering BPEL PM running on WebLogic Server, the WebLogic   Server and the corresponding domain should be discovered and monitored by  Enterprise Manager.  [ 151 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  The starting point for BPEL PM discovery is the agent homepage for the agent   through which the WebLogic domain is monitored. From this agent homepage,  under Monitored Targets section, select Oracle BPEL Process Manager from the  drop-down and click on Go. The following screenshot shows the agent page where  you can see the option to add BPEL PM:  Once you click on Go, a three-step wizard will be launched and you will have to  provide details at each step:  1.  Select the WebLogic Server where BPEL PM is running. If you select a  WebLogic Server where BPEL PM is not running, it will be suggested   that you select a new server.    2.  Provide Oracle Home where BPEL PM is installed and Application Server   Home where WebLogic Server is installed.  3.  Host credential where BPEL PM is running.   At the end of the wizard BPEL PM running on WebLogic will be discovered.

This step is the same as it was in the case of  BPEL PM on OC4J, therefore, you can refer to the section, Monitoring configuration for  BPEL PM on OC4J.  BPEL Process Manager running on  WebSphere The discovery of BPEL PM running on WebSphere is very similar to the discovery of  BPEL PM running on WebLogic. The WebSphere server where BPEL PM is running  should be discovered and monitored by Enterprise Manager. The starting point of  discovery is the same, that is the agent homepage.  The only difference is in the second step of the previous section where you will need  to provide one additional parameter. This parameter is the location of the BPEL PM  application on the host on which WebSphere is running.  Monitoring BPEL PM and BPEL   processes In the previous sections, we learnt how to discover BPEL PM and BPEL processes.  We saw that the discovery process is different for BPEL PM running on different  J2EE containers. The good news is that the monitoring aspect is the same,  irrespective of the underlying J2EE container.  Monitoring BPEL PM We know that BPEL PM runs on top of a J2EE container, uses Oracle database  as a dehydration store, and that traffic to BPEL PM is routed through some  HTTP gateways. To effectively monitor BPEL PM, we need to monitor all related  components along with BPEL PM. Performance and availability of any related  component can affect the performance and availability of BPEL PM. Collectively,   we refer to BPEL PM and related components such as the BPEL eco system.   [ 153 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  We learnt in Chapter 5, Managing Oracle Application Server, about System and  Service constructs. Using system construct, we can group all such related targets  as one system. To monitor the system we can also define a "service" that is based  on the system. Using this service, we can monitor the collective availability and  performance of all such related targets in one place. If required, we can use this  service to define the Service Level Agreements for availability and performance of  the BPEL eco system. We refer to this service as "BPEL Infrastructure Service"—it  represents the entire infrastructure needed to run BPEL PM.  Creation of the system and service sounds like lot of work, but Enterprise Manager  provides an easy way to create system service for BPEL eco system. To use this  feature, go to the BPEL PM homepage, there you will see an option to create the  system and service. The following screenshot shows the Create BPEL Infrastructure  Service button:  [ 154 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Once you click on the Create BPEL Infrastructure Service button, you will be asked  to provide a name for the service. Once you provide the name and submit the page,  Enterprise Manager will create a service by the name provided by you and a system  by the same name with _system appended to it, and you will be redirected to BPEL  PM. The following screenshot shows one such page where we created a service by  the name mybpelservice and system by the name mybpelservice_system:   Chapter 7  On this page you will see the Create BPEL Infrastructure Service button is changed  to Refresh BPEL Infrastructure Service. In case there are some membership changes  in the BPEL eco system, you can click on this button and the system definition also  gets refreshed to reflect the current BPEL ecosystem.

The following screenshot shows  the service homepage:  There are some more tabs on this page that contain more details about the service:            The Charts tab displays the performance charts The Test Performance tab displays the performance of tests defined on   the service The System tab shows all the components for the underlying system The Topology tab displays the topological view of the underlying system  We will leave it to you to explore the other tabs on the service homepage. We have  covered some of the service features in other chapters such as 4 and 5. From this  page you can click on the System link to see all the components in the system.

In this  section, we'll learn how we can monitor BPEL processes. At a very basic level, each  BPEL process defines the flow and sequence of web services that need to be called  to achieve a business operation. For example, an imaginary "Expense Report" BPEL  process defines the flow of submissions, approvals, and payments. In this scenario,  whenever a user submits an Expense report, one web service call is made to inform  his manager, after approval by the manager, another web service call is made to  the payment gateway. These web service calls are encapsulated as partner links. At  a very basic level, partner links defines what web service needs to be called, what  method in web service needs to be called and with what parameters.   Often these partner links represent services from another department or another  business entity altogether.  For basic monitoring of BPEL processes there are a lot of good metrics collected by  Enterprise Manager. For the advanced monitoring, Enterprise Manager provides a  monitoring model for BPEL processes.   BPEL process metrics Enterprise Manager captures various metrics related to each BPEL process. Some of  the important metrics are:         Total number of instances—opened, closed, retryable New instances—opened, closed Average, minimum, and maximum time taken by instance  [ 157 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  The following screenshot shows one such page where you can see important metrics  for all the BPEL processes. You can click on these metrics and see historical views.   To see the details of one particular BPEL process click on any of the processes listed  in the previous screenshot and you will see a page as shown next:  [ 158 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 7                     On this page, you will see the details about BPEL process such as:  State,, Lifecycle Stage show the current state and lifecycle stage of BPEL Lifecycle Stage show the current state and lifecycle stage of BPEL  Stage show the current state and lifecycle stage of BPEL Stage show the current state and lifecycle stage of BPEL  show the current state and lifecycle stage of BPEL  process; state can be up or down, and lifecycle can have the value of active   or retire.  Version number and deployment date for BPEL process.  Total number of Error instances and Retryable instances. Throughput and Response metrics. Throughput metrics include incoming,  error and closed instances. Response metrics include maximum, minimum,  and average time for instances. Partner link details and respective WSDL locations.  Monitoring model for BPEL processes The availability and performance of BPEL process is dependent on two things:  BPEL ecosystem: If BPEL ecosystem is down, then the process will also be  down. This dependency is more on an IT infrastructure. Partner links: Generally BPEL process has multiple partner links where each  partner link represents a call to a web service. Availability and performance  of BPEL process also depends on the availability and performance of partner  links. For example, lets assume that there is an "Employee Expense report  BPEL process", and for all approved expenses it makes a web service call  to the payment gateway for payments to the credit card company. In this  imaginary scenario, if the web service for the payment gateway goes down,  all of the expense reports will not be paid and that BPEL process will be  considered down.  In case you didn't realize, your job as a BPEL Administrator just got more complex.  So far you were asked to monitor all the components of the BPEL eco system—now  you have to monitor all partner links as well and many of them may be running  outside your data centre.  The good news is that Enterprise Manager provides a model to manage this  complexity. Before we go into the details of this model, lets revisit the concept of   test and beacon.  In earlier chapters  4 and 5 , we saw that we can record user actions and repeat those  actions periodically to proactively monitor end user experience. These user actions  are saved as tests and are executed from beacons. For monitoring of partner links we  can use the SOAP test, where we can make a web service call to partner link every  fixed interval and can find out its availability.  [ 159 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  The monitoring model that Enterprise Manager provides for BPEL process  monitoring includes three services:           BPEL Infrastructure service: We learnt about this in the previous section,  how this service represents all the components in BPEL ecosystem. Availability service: This service represents all the availability tests for a  BPEL process; it could include SOAP tests, Web transactions, and so on. Aggregate service: This service is just an aggregate of the previous two  services. Using this service you can monitor all the required metrics in one  place. You can see the performance of your IT infrastructure as well as the  performance of partner links in one place.   Again it may sound very complex to create or maintain this model, let's follow the  listed steps to see how Enterprise Manager makes it easy:  1.  Go to the Processes tab on a BPEL target homepage, click on one of the  services and you will see a page that shows details of BPEL process. On  this page you will see the option to Create Service, click on that to create an  Aggregate service. The following screenshot shows the page that you will see  after you have clicked on Create Service. You can see that the Infrastructure  service is a  part of this aggregated service.

From the Partner links section, select a partner link by clicking on the radio   button next to it ,and click on Add SOAP Test, you will see the page as  shown next. Please note that this page is dynamic, Enterprise Manager parses  the WSDL and based on the WSDL definition, the data input fields may vary.  You may need to talk to your application administrator or owner to fill in  those details.

Click OK on this page. On the next page you will be asked to select some   beacons. The following screenshot shows that page:  4.  Click OK and you will come back to the BPEL process page. You will notice   that a new service is added. The name of this service is <BPEL process name  >_Availability and under this service you can see a SOAP test added.  You have completed the model of your BPEL process, using this model you can  monitor all the dependencies for your BPEL process, that include:       BPEL ecosystem Availability of partner links  SOAP test invokes the actual web service. If the web service is read-only,  then there are no issues. If the web service does some updates to the  business systems, then by submitting a SOAP test, you are creating some  artificial transactions. Make sure that your application has a way to filter  out, or ignore these transactions; these transactions should not be treated  as regular business transactions. Generally, each application has some  special user-IDs or credit card numbers that are ignored and those user- IDs credit card numbers are used for such synthetic transactions. If there is no way to filter out artificial transactions—DO NOT use the  SOAP test or any other tests that create artificial transactions.  You can explore the other features of the aggregate service by visiting the aggregate  service homepage. You can see availability and service levels for the service and you  can drill down to Infrastructure service or individual components.

The next screenshot  shows one such case, where you can see that one of the SOAP tests is getting errors  and that indicates that one partner link is down, and that is the root cause of BPEL  process availability issues. It is violating the Service Level Agreements also.  Chapter 7  Configuration management We saw in the earlier chapters that Enterprise Manager collects configuration  snapshots that are useful in keeping track of the configuration changes. Enterprise  Manager refreshes the configuration snapshot periodically, and any change in the  configuration is also recorded in the repository. You can also use the configuration  snapshots to compare the configuration of one target with another target of the   same type.  Configuration data collected for BPEL PM includes:          SOAP URL and SOAP callback URL Dehydration store details—host, port, s-id for dehydration store Cluster configuration if BPEL PM is part of cluster  [ 163 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management           List of the BPEL domains and domain specific configuration parameters like  minimum and maximum threads BPEL PM configuration files like collaxa-config.xml, jgroups-protocol. xml, and so on List of the BPEL processes deployed, and the artefacts for BPEL processes  such as bpel.xml, xsds, wsdls, and so on  To see the latest collected configuration for a BPEL PM target, follow the steps   listed next:  1.

We will discuss those in the   following sections.  BPEL suitcase deployment In a development environment, developers and BPEL process designers deploy  BPEL process to BPEL PM directly from the development IDE. This process works  fine in the development environment. To deploy the BPEL processes in staging, QA  or production environment developers need to package BPEL processes in BPEL  suitcases, and system administrators deploy the BPEL suitcases.  Also, there are times when the same BPEL suitcase needs to be deployed in multiple  environments, but for each deployment, some customizations are needed. For  example, the same BPEL process is deployed in the QA and in the production  environment, the BPEL process in QA environment needs to make a call to the  partner link of the QA environment and the BPEL process in the production  environment needs to make a call to the partner link of the production environment.  This can be achieved by applying a deployment plan when deploying a BPEL  suitcase. The deployment plan is a simple text file that defines customizations for   a given environment. Please refer to the BPEL PM documentation for more details   on the format of this document. The following listing shows a snippet of a  deployment plan using which the wsdl location of a BPEL partner link can be  changed during deployment:          ReadNewCustomerFileService.wsdl       As an administrator, you need to remember which suitcases need to be deployed and  which deployment plan needs to be applied, also you may need to deploy the BPEL  process during non-office hours. We learned about the software library in Chapter 3, Enterprise Manager Key Concepts  and Subsystems, the software library is a central repository to keep any useful  artefacts, those artefacts could be the gold image of the Linux server or a BPEL  suitcase or a deployment plan. In the next few paragraphs, we'll see how we can  store the BPEL suitcase and deployment plan in the software library, once we have  them in the software library, how do we deploy them to BPEL PM.

Upload an artefact in the software library—go to Enterprise Manager  homepage and click on the Deployments tab, then further click on the  Provisioning tab. This will show you the listing of artefacts in the software  library, it looks similar to the file explorer view in Windows, the following  screenshot shows the view of such a listing:  Chapter 7  2.  From this page you can create delete new folders and add delete artefacts  in any folder. There are some out-of-the-box folders; BPEL Process Suitcase  and BPEL Process Deployment Plan are two of these. You can load your  BPEL suitcases and BPEL deployment plans in corresponding folders.   To do so, select a particular folder and click on Create Component.

On this screen, select Upload from Local Machine—that means that you  are uploading an artefact from the machine where the browser is running.  Complete the rest of the steps and your artefact will be uploaded.  6.  Repeat steps 1-5 to upload all BPEL suitcases and deployment plans. 7.  To deploy one or more suitcases to one or more BPEL PM, go to the BPEL  PM homepage and click on the Deploy BPEL suitcase link in the related  links section. You will see a page where you can select the BPEL suitcase to  be deployed and the deployment plan to be applied.  8.  On this page you can also define the order in which BPEL suitcases are   deployed; you can use the Move Up or Move Down button to do so. The  following screenshot shows one such page:  [ 171 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—BPEL Management  9.	 On the next page you can select the BPEL PM where you want to deploy the   suitcases that you selected on the previous screen:  10.  In the remaining steps you will be asked to provide the host and BPEL   credentials and the schedule for deploying the suitcase. Once you complete  the flow and submit the deployment procedure, Enterprise Manager will  deploy the suitcase at the scheduled time.  Provisioning and patching of BPEL PM We saw in Chapter 5, Managing Oracle Application Server, that Enterprise Manager  provides deployment procedures to provision the Oracle Application Server.

In SOA based systems, services  need to interact or exchange messages with other services also. Oracle Service Bus   is a product that provides a platform for interaction and message exchange   between services.  Integration of disparate services can be a challenge. There could be a difference   in messaging models—some services may support the synchronous model,   whereas other services may support the asynchronous model. Some services may  support HTTP protocol, whereas other services may support JMS protocol. Oracle  Service Bus provides helps in solving many of these challenges by providing the  following features:  Support for different protocols, such as HTTP s , FTP, JMS, E-mail, Tuxedo,  and so on Support for different messaging models, such as point-to-point model,  publish-subscribe model Support for different message formats, such as SOAP, E-mail, JMS, XML,   and so on Support for different content types such as XML, binary, and so on Data transformation using XLST and Xquery—data mapping from one  format to another format through declarative constructs  Besides the integration support, OSB provides features that help in managing  runtime for the integration of services. Some features are:   Load balancing:  Load balancing is very important when traffic volume  between services is very high. Load balancing also helps to achieve    high availability. Content-based routing: Routing to appropriate service based on content is  very valuable in the changing business environment.  OSB provides loosely-coupled bus architecture, where all services and consumers of  services can be plugged into, and OSB becomes a central place for defining mediation  rules between services and consumers, as shown next:                      [ 176 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Service  Service  Service  Service  Chapter 8  Management Dashboard Monitoring  SLAs  Reporting  Open Interfaces  AquaLogic  Service  Bus  Composition  Message  Flow  Modeling  Security  Messaging  Discovery  Validation  Transformation  Service Call-out  Test  Browser  Transport Security  WS-Security  Console Security  Policy  Services Transport Layer  Transport SDK  Service  Service  Service  Service  At implementation level, OSB is a set of J2EE applications that run on top of  WebLogic J2EE container. It uses various J2EE constructs like Enterprise Java   Bean, data source, connectors, and so on. OSB uses a database for storing the  reporting data.   OSB can be deployed in a single server model or clustered server model. Generally,  in a production environment a clustered model is used, where multiple WebLogic  Servers are used for load balancing and high-availability. In such setups, multiple  WebLogic Servers are front-ended by a load balancer. The following figure depicts  one such clustered deployment.

Proxy service OSB provides mediation between consumer and provider services. This mediation is  loosely coupled where a consumer service makes a call to intermediate service, and  the intermediate service performs some transformation and routes it to producer  service. This intermediate service is hosted by OSB and called Proxy service.  Business service Business service is a representation of actual producer service. Business service  controls the call to business service, it knows about the business service endpoint.  In case of failure in calling producer service, it can retry the operation. In case there  are multiple producer services, it knows about the endpoint of each producer service  and provides load balancing across those endpoints.  Message flow Message flow is a set of steps that are executed by the proxy service before it  routes to the business service. It includes steps for data transformation, validation,  reporting, and so on.  Supported versions Enterprise Manager provides OSB management from release 10.2.0.5 onwards.   The following is the support matrix for EM against different versions of   OSB management:   EM Version 10.2.0.5  OSB 2.6 Yes  OSB 2.6.1 Yes  OSB 3.0 Yes  OSB 10gR3 Yes  To manage or monitor OSB from Enterprise Manager 10.2.0.5, some patches  are needed on OSB servers. The following table lists the patch number for each  supported OSB release:   OSB version 2.6, 2.6.1 3.0 10gR3  Patch ID B8SZ SWGQ 7NPS  [ 178 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 8   The SmartUpdate patching tool that comes with WebLogic installation can be  used to apply these patches. Before downloading or applying these patches, check  Enterprise Manager documentation for any updates on patch Ids.  Discovery of Oracle Service Bus Oracle Service Bus gets discovered as part of WebLogic domain, managed server  discovery. We saw in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic Server, how Enterprise  Manager Agent discovers WebLogic domain and managed servers. Along with  domain, cluster and managed server targets, OSB targets are also created and  persisted in the Enterprise Manager repository. Just like WebLogic domain and server targets, OSB can also be discovered and  monitored, either by remote agent or local agent. In case you want to use OSB  service's provisioning feature you will need to discover monitor OSB in the local  agent mode. In the local agent mode, the agent is installed where the domain admin  server is running. In the remote agent mode, the agent can be on any other host on  the same network. After discovery you will see the Oracle Service Bus target on the Middleware  tab of the EM homepage. The following screenshot shows the OSB target on the  Middleware tab.

Enterprise Manager provides similar support for managing and monitoring   OSB eco system.  Monitoring OSB For monitoring OSB, you can go to the OSB homepage, where you can see the  status and availability of OSB. It shows some other details like the host, name of the host, name of the , name of the  WebLogic Server Domain where OSB is installed. It also shows some coarse-grained  historical view of traffic metrics—where it shows message error security violation  rates for all the services. On the Home page there is an option to create an infrastructure system and service.  The steps for creating an infrastructure system service is exactly the same as BPEL, so  we will not repeat those steps and will leave it as an exercise. The following screenshot  shows one such homepage after the infrastructure system services are created.

From the OSB  homepage, click on JMS Performance, and you will see the performance of JMS  queues used by OSB. The following screenshot shows one such page. You can see   the metrics for message inflow and messages pending.  Chapter 8  Monitoring OSB services OSB service monitoring can be divided into two parts—proxy service that receives  the requests and business service that dispatches the requests. Proxy service metrics  also include the metrics in message flow, where message flow processes the request.  Monitoring proxy services Performance of proxy services represents the performance seen by consumers of  OSB. Besides that, proxy services are hosted by OSB servers. Enterprise Manager  collects some very useful metrics for proxy services. These metrics are:             Status of proxy service Throughput metrics at proxy service and endpoint level Performance metrics at proxy service level and endpoint level Error metrics at service level and end point level Security violation at proxy service level  [ 181 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—OSB  aka ALSB  Management  To monitor the performance of message flow, there are some fine-grained metrics  available, these metrics include throughput, error rate, and performance at each step  in the message flow. Let's go through the console screens for OSB service monitoring. Go to the OSB  Services tab from OSB homepage, on that page you will see a listing of all the  services that include proxy as well as business services.  You will see every proxy and business services is part of some project. OSB provides  a construct project under which different services can be created; project is just a  means to categorize different services.   The following screenshot shows such a page where you can see the list of all the  projects and services. For each service you see metrics related to throughput, errors,  violations, and performance.

On this page, you can see the throughput  and performance chart for the proxy service. You will also see a section for the EM  service model that represents a proxy service. This model is similar to the model that  we had for the BPEL process. This mode has three entities:           Infrastructure service: This service represents all of the components in the  OSB eco system. Availability service: This service represents all of the availability tests for an  OSB proxy service endpoint, it could include SOAP tests, Web transactions etc. Aggregate service: This service is just an aggregate of the previous two  services. Using this service, you can monitor all of the required metrics in one  place. You can see the performance of your IT infrastructure as well as the  performance of partner links in one place.  The next screenshot shows such a page where you can see the details of the   OSB service:  [ 183 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—OSB  aka ALSB  Management  On the same screen, you will see the routing details that show what all business  services are getting called from this proxy service. These details are listed under the  references section. You will see the status of proxy service endpoint and business  service endpoint. Other details available from this page include protocol, endpoint of  proxy business service. The next screenshot shows one such page. From this page,  you can add SOAP test for OSB proxy service endpoint and business service end  point. These SOAP tests are added to the availability service that we have   discussed earlier:  From the Details tab on the same page, you can see the performance and throughput  metrics at each individual step in the message flow. For each decision point,  transformation, routing, and so on, you can see some useful metrics on this page.   The screenshot below shows a listing of steps and metrics for each step.

Chapter 8  Monitoring business services Business service routes the request to services implemented somewhere else. In  some cases, these services could be out of your business unit or even organization; in  other cases, it could be some service providers for you. For some important services,  you might already have some Service Level Agreements defined therefore, for these  services it is very important to measure the performance of OSB business services.

We'll leave it as an exercise for you to complete. You can also compare  the configuration of one OSB with another OSB, this is also very similar to the  configuration of BPEL PM—we will leave that as an exercise for you to complete too.  Lifecycle management for Oracle Service  Bus  In this section, we will cover how to provision the OSB services. In previous  chapters, we learned about deployment procedures, software library, and   gold images.  In a development environment, developers can build new OSB services through  Eclipse IDE or through the OSB administration console. The OSB administration  console is a web-based application for OSB configuration and it can also be used to  define new OSB services.   To deploy OSB services in a staging or production environment, administrator  needs to extract services from the development environment and deploy them to the  production environment. Besides deployment in new environment, administrators  may need some environment-specific customizations on the services.  Enterprise Manager provides deployment procedures and using which you can:          Extract OSB services from a reference environment and build gold image Provision new OSB service from a reference environment, and apply  customizations Provision new OSB service from gold image and apply customizations  [ 187 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   SOA Management—OSB  aka ALSB  Management  How to use this feature  1.   Go to the Deployments tab on the Enterprise Manager homepage. On this   page click on the Deployment Procedures link.  2.   On the next page, you will see a list of all deployment procedures.

Through  some exercises we saw how EM can simplify these complexities. The key takeaways  before you move to the next chapter is:  Chapter 8                         OSB is used to integrate disparate services. We need to manage the whole OSB eco system, as the availability and  performance of OSB is dependent on the availability and performance   of any related component. You can do basic monitoring of OSB services using metrics. For OSB we   have metrics at proxy service, business service, and message flow level. For advanced monitoring you need to monitor performance of proxy,  business service endpoints and BPEL eco system. Enterprise Manager  provides a model to support that. Enterprise Manager provides very fine-grained metrics for message   flow, where throughput, and error metrics are available for each step   in message flow. You can use configuration management to keep track of   configuration changes. The software library can be used to keep OSB resources and   customization files. You can use deployment procedures for moving OSB services from one  environment to another environment.  In this chapter and the last few chapters we learnt about monitoring of middleware  targets like Oracle Application Server, WebLogic Server, BPEL, OSB, and so on. In all  these chapters we have also learnt about monitoring of middleware targets that can  suggest a problem. But what do we do to fix the problems in applications running  on these targets? In our next chapter you will see how to diagnose the issues in  application and pinpoint the problem area.

Oracle Identity and Access  Management Suite has become a popular choice for organizations needing to  manage identities for both custom and packaged applications. Your business may   completely depend upon the identity and access management infrastructure and any  performance or availability issues may cause severe disruption to your business.  In this chapter, you will learn about:   Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite and its components Discovery and monitoring of different components of Oracle Identity and  Access Management Suite  The Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite is a part of the Oracle Fusion  Middleware family and includes several products. We can categorize Oracle's  Identity and Access Management products into three broad categories:              Directory services Access management Identity management  The components such as Directory Integration Platform, Oracle Single Sign-on  Server, and so on, come under the Identity Infrastructure components.

Serves as the central  user repository for identity and access management  deployment. Facilitates the integration of applications into existing  identity infrastructures. Provides Web-based identity administration, as well as  access control to Web applications and resources running  in  heterogeneous environments. It provides the user and  group management, delegated administration, password  management and self-service functions. Automates user provisioning, identity administration, and  password management. Enables cross-domain single sign-on and allows companies  to manage user identities in order to access resources  managed by another domain.  It is really beyond the scope of this book to go into the details of each component  of the Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite. Refer to the documentation at  http:  download.oracle.com docs cd B28196_01 idmanage.htm for details.  Note that different components of Oracle Identity and Access Management may   run on different Java EE application servers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or a  third-party application server, such as IBM Websphere and Jboss Application Server.  Refer to the latest certification matrix in My Oracle Support time for the latest  certification for such combinations.  Oracle Identity Management targets Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite has several components and hence  these components are represented as several targets with in Enterprise Manager. The  following table describes the targets that are monitored for the Oracle Identity and  Access Management Suite:  [ 194 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Target Type Access Manager—Access Server  Access Manager—Identity Server  Access Manager—Access System  Access Manager—Identity System  Identity Federation Server Identity Federation System  Identity Manager Server Identity Manager Repository Identity Manager System  Chapter 9  Description Representation of the Access Server component of  Access Manager.

However,  you can build a JVM target to monitor the Oracle Virtual Directory. We will learn  about building a JVM target in the extensibility chapter of this book.  Discovery of Oracle Identity and Access  Management Suite You have to manually discover the components of Identity and Access Management  Suite from Grid Control. The different components such as Access Server and  Identity Server for Access Manager, Identity Manager Server, and Identity  Federation Server are discovered separately.   You have to make sure that the Oracle Management Agent is installed on the hosts to  manage those components.

Then select the appropriate target type, for example  Oracle Access Server, as shown in the following screenshot and enter the Host  Name, in which the EM agent is running, in order to monitor the target you want   to discover.      Note that the Oracle Internet Directory is not discovered as a part of Identity  Manager Suite but it is discovered automatically when Oracle Application Server  Farm containing Oracle Internet Directory. If you want to monitor Oracle Internet  Directory from Grid Control you have to install the plug-in by downloading it from  http:  www.oracle.com technology software products ias htdocs 101401. html. We will discuss the discovery of the following components in this chapter:         Access Manager Identity Manager  Identity Federation   Discovery of Access Manager  The discovery and management of Oracle Access Manager components-both  Access Server and Identity Server-requires the SNMP agent. The SNMP agent is an  optional component and must be installed on the machine where either the Access  Server or Identity Server is running. You can refer to the Oracle Access Manager  Installation Guide at http:  download-west.oracle.com docs cd B28196_01  idmanage.1014 b25353 snmp.htm for details.   Ensure that you have enabled SNMP monitoring for your Access Manager  components, and that you have registered your SNMP agent with your   component and restarted the component.

You have to  appropriately select if the management agent is running on a remote machine rather  than the SNMP host. You have to enter the home directory for the access server  home, for example  oracle oam 10.1.4 access, the version of the access server,  for example. 10.1.4, and the port number and community name for the SNMP host. The discovery process will find the complete topology of your Identity Server, for  example, the associated databases such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server and LDAP  servers. You have an option to either create a new Access Manager—Access System or  add the discovered components to an existing system. We learnt earlier that a system  allows Administrators to manage related components targets as a single entity.

Enterprise Manager discovers the associated  databases and LDAP server, and allows you to create a new Identity system or add  these to an existing system.  Identity Manager Server The Identity Manager Server runs on an application server such as Oracle WebLogic  Server and requires a database repository. The associated application server and the  databases have to be discovered prior to the discovery of Identity Server. Refer to  Chapter 4—Managing Oracle WebLogic Server, for the discovery of Oracle WebLogic  Server. If your Identity Manager Server runs on a third-party application server such  as JBoss then you have to refer to Chapter 11—Managing Non-Oracle Middleware, for  the discovery of third-party middleware.  You have to enter the details as shown in the following figure for the discovery of  Identity Server Manager.

Finally, it allows you to create the  Identity Manager System, as shown next:  Chapter 9  Identity Federation Server The Identity Federation Server runs on an Oracle Application Server and depends  on an LDAP directory such as Oracle Internet Directory and database to store user  data. The associated application server discovered prior to the discovery of Identity  Federation Server. Refer to Chapter 5, Managing Oracle Application Server, for the  discovery of Oracle Application Server. The discovery of Identity Federation Server  is quite straightforward and it just requires a selection of Application Server Install  and credentials for the server host. Enterprise Manager will automatically discover  the underlying database and LDAP server and you will be prompted to create  Identity Federation System at the end of the discovery.

For example,  if you want to monitor the health of your Identity Manager Server, you can navigate  to All Targets and then search for Identity Manager Servers and navigate to its  homepage. For example, the following screenshot shows the homepage for Identity  Manager Repository. The homepage provides some important metrics such as SQL  Response time and the number of users provisioned, locked, deleted, and so on. Like  all targets, the alerts show up in the homepage.

You can view all of  the metrics available for a target type by navigating to the All Metrics of the Target  homepage. For example, the following figure shows the all metrics view of Access  Manager—Access Server component.  Chapter 9  Each target types provide performance pages that help you to monitor key  performance metrics for those targets. We will not bore you to death by showing you  the homepages and performance pages of all components and instead we will leave  that as an exercise for you to explore.

Like  other targets, you can navigate to those by selecting Metric and Policy Settings for  each target type. For example, you can set critical and metric thresholds for several  metrics such as Active Invocations, Active Session Count, and so on, for Identity  Manager Server, as shown in the following screenshot:  Besides monitoring the Identity Management components, you can also monitor  the health of the complete infrastructure. We learnt earlier in this chapter that you  build systems for each of these component types during the discovery process. This  provides visibility of the health of the dependent components, and helps to diagnose  problems quickly. The following figure shows the components of the Identity  Manager System.

You can view the alerts, policy  violations, and some of the key metrics for the components. You can customize   these systems to suit your need. For example, you can create a system that   contains all identity manager components that you use in your environment.  Service level management The performance and availability of the Identity and Access Management system is  crucial for most organizations. A down or degraded service level for these systems  may greatly impact on the performance of several applications that depend on the  Identity and Access Management Suite. Enterprise Manager allows you to create  service and establish service level and monitor these services for any service level  violations. You can create a generic service or web application service for any of the  identity management component that you are monitoring.   We learnt how to create a web application service for an application deployed in  WebLogic Server in Chapter 4—Managing Oracle WebLogic Server. You can use the  same approach to build a service for your identity system.  For example, the following figure shows a service that we had built for Oracle   Access Manager:     [ 203 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Identity Manager Suite  We have two service tests for this service and the OAM Login test verifies the  availability and performance of users that are logging into applications using Oracle  Access Manager. The following screenshot shows the details of the service test:  You can build similar service tests for other components of the suite to ensure their  availability and performance. This will make sure that your Identity and Access  Management System Suite meets the service level that you agreed upon.   Configuration management Enterprise Manager allows you to track configurations and compare configurations  between two different versions of the same target or two entirely different targets of  the same type. Enterprise Manager has only configuration management capabilities  for Access Manager components.   You can access the configuration management capabilities of Access Server and  Identity server by accessing the relevant link from their homepages. The following  figure shows the configuration history for Access Server:    [ 204 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 9  You can see that the configurations have been changed on several dates. You can  click on the history records to view the changes as shown in the following figure  where the Number of listener threads parameter was changed from 27 to 0. Similarly, you can compare the configurations between two different versions of  the configuration files or between two different servers; for example the test and  production servers. The following screenshot shows the comparison between two  different versions and the differences:  [ 205 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Identity Manager Suite  Many of the performance problems are caused by configuration changes  and Enterprise Manager helps you to track down the root causes of these by  configuration tracking and configuration comparison features.  Summary Oracle Identity and Access Management Suite provides management of identities  and access control for enterprise business applications. Ensuring the performance  and availability of these components is critical to your business. The Identity and  Access Management Suite comprises of several components and it is a difficult  task to ensure the management of these. In this chapter, you learnt how to discover  these components and how to monitor the performance and service level of these  applications. You also learnt how to manage the configurations of Oracle Access  Manager components. We will learn about the management of coherence cluster   in the next chapter.

Oracle Coherence comes with several  editions or flavors. You can either use Coherence as a caching solution within your  enterprise applications as a shared library, or as an external data grid solution  providing distributed data management capabilities. The Coherence product does  not come with a management console providing a visibility gap to the Coherence  cluster. Effectively, managing your Oracle Coherence environment is critical to  maximizing application availability and ensuring a high Quality of Service  QoS .   In this chapter, we will learn:           What an Oracle Coherence cluster is How to discover a Coherence cluster Monitoring and management of a Coherence cluster Provisioning of a Coherence cluster and nodes  Coherence overview A Coherence cluster is a set of Coherence nodes that work together to provide a  distributed caching service. A node may be an application server instance or a Java  process running Coherence binaries. Coherence functionality is based on the concept  of cluster services. Each node can either provide or consume a number of named  services. The services may either be caching or data service, connectivity services,  management service, and so on. A node providing a caching service is often referred  to as a storage node and a node providing management node i.e. hosting the   Mbean server is referred to as a management node. For more about Coherence,   refer to the Coherence documentation in the Oracle Technology Network at:   http:  download.oracle.com docs cd E14526_01 index.htm  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Coherence Cluster  Oracle Coherence comes with several flavors or editions. Take a look at the Oracle  Technology Network for the features offered by each edition: http:  www.oracle. com technology products coherence coherencedatagrid coherence_ editions.html.   The following figure shows the architecture for each editions of Coherence:   Coherence  Standard Edition  Coherence  Enterprise Edition  Coherence Grid Edition  Application Server  Application Server  Application 1  Application 2  Coherence Standard  Coherence Standard  Middleware Infrastructure  Coherence Enterprise  Application Server Transaction Manager  Coherence Grid  Coherence Grid  Middleware Infrastructure  Middleware Infrastructure  You can use Enterprise Manager to monitor your Coherence cluster.   Enterprise manager supports only Coherence Enterprise Edition and Grid  Edition. You have to enable management service for your Coherence  cluster to monitor from Enterprise Manager Grid Control.

As we discussed earlier, a node could either be a storage, proxy,  or management node and each node is nothing but a JVM process. For example, a  Coherence node may have 16 nodes, where 14 may be storage nodes and one may  be a management node and another a proxy node. The management node hosts  a JMX server, and Oracle Enterprise Manager depends on the management node  for discovering and monitoring the Coherence cluster. The Oracle Management  Agent talks to the management node for collecting metrics, propagating runtime  configuration changes, and so on.  Enterprise Manager discovers the entire cluster in a single step and requires a single  agent to monitor the entire cluster.   The agent can either be local or remote where management node is  running. The agent box should be able to communicate with the host  running the management node.  You have to start management nodes and other Coherence nodes with special   start-up parameters. The Coherence Developer's Guide documents contain material on  how to enable JMX for Coherence cluster  http:  download.oracle.com docs cd  E13924_01 coh.340 e13818 managejmx.htmBABICAAI  .  The management node provides an aggregated view of monitoring metrics by  collecting it from other nodes. If you have a large number of nodes in the cluster,  the metrics collection may take a long time. Enterprise Manager ships some binaries,  called Bulk Mbean, that makes collection and aggregation of metrics much faster and  we recommend that you use those binaries to start your management node. These  JAR files  bulkoperationsmbean_11.1.1.jar, coherenceEMIntg.jar  are shipped  in the OMS. You have to copy these JAR files to your server where you are starting  the management node.  Starting Coherence management node using  bulk management Mbeans You have to start your management node before you can discover the cluster. If  you want to use bulk management Mbean, copy those to your server where you  have a management node. You have to modify your start script to include the  coherenceEMIntg.jar and bulkoperationsmbean_11.1.1.jar files.

The agent  talks to the management node using this port.  See the Coherence Developer's Guide for additional options that you can use to start the  management node, for example, security credentials.  Now that we have learned how to use the set-up required for starting up the  management node, we will move ahead and discover the Coherence cluster.  The Coherence Target Model Before we discover Coherence Cluster, let us understand the target model for  Coherence. In Coherence cluster, nodes, caches, connection managers, and so on,  seem to be the perfect fit to be considered as a target. However, from Enterprise  Manager's perspective, only the Coherence cluster is a managed target. Coherence  nodes, caches, and so on are not real targets from an EM perspective. However, each  of these entities' nodes, caches, and so on have homepages and you can have alerts  appear on these pages whenever an alert is generated.  Discovering Oracle Coherence  Before you discover the Coherence cluster, you have to make sure that the  Management Agent is running and discovered. You have to also ensure that the  Coherence management node is up and running. If you have multiple management  nodes in the cluster, ensure that your primary management node is up and running.  Check the certification matrix at My Oracle Support to verify if the Coherence  version you are using is certified with Grid Control.   [ 210 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 10  To discover the Coherence cluster, log on to the Enterprise Manager Grid Control as  an administrator that has Add target privilege. Then select the middleware targets  and select Add Oracle Coherence page. Then select the host name where Oracle Management Agent is running, which you  will use to discover monitor the Coherence cluster.  On the next page, you have to enter the details for connecting to the management  node for Oracle Coherence as in the following screenshot:  The important parameters are the Machine Name and JMX Remote Port for the  Coherence management node. You have to ensure that these parameters are supplied  correctly for monitoring to work. Select the default value Bulk Operation Mbean  if you have started the managed node with bulk management Mbean. You have to  select the appropriate version for the Coherence cluster.

The following table provides the description for  other optional parameters for discovery:  Parameter User Name and  Password   Communication  Protocol  Service Name  Service URL   SSLTrustStore  Custom Lockup  Provider Class  Bulk Operations  MBeans  Description The credentials required for connecting to the Coherence JMX Server. The User Name and password specified $JDK_HOME jre lib management jmxremote.password  file.   The protocol used for JMX connection. The default is rmi.   The service name used for the connection. The default is jmxrmi.  The JMX Service URL that will be used for JMX connection. If you  enter the URL, the values specified in the Machine Name, Port,  Communication Protocol, and Service Name fields will be ignored.  Example: service:jmx:rmi:  hostname:3001 jndi rmi:   hostname:9001 server  This is required only when you have enabled SSL for JMX Connection  for your Coherence Management Server. This indicates the SSL store  where trusted certificates are stored. This is used only when the above JMX connection details are  dynamic and must programatically be looked up, for example from  some LDAP server. You have to enter the class that implements  JMXLookUp. Oracle has supplied the Bulk MBean to improve the performance  of the MBean server and the default value  Coherence: type=BulkOperations  should be used if you use those JARS to start  your Mbean server.  You can select OK to add the Coherence cluster and it will be added as a target. If  the monitoring properties are not correct, then you will get errors when trying to  monitor from Enterprise Manager. You can select monitoring configuration and enter  the correct configuration for monitoring. If you have multiple management nodes  in your cluster and your management node goes down, you can switch to another  management node by changing the monitoring configuration to point to another  management node.

The Coherence  cluster homepage provides important aspects of the Coherence cluster. You can   monitor availability and performance of the cluster from this page, as shown in   the following screenshot:  Chapter 10  The publisher and receiver success rate provides the health of the network and looks  at how the nodes are communicating with each other. If the Publisher and Receiver  Success Rates are significantly down, you have to worry about the health of the  cluster because the nodes are not effectively communicating with each other.  It provides the number of nodes, objects, hosts, the CPU and memory usage and  status of the services. For a caching service such as Distributed Cache, you should  not see the status as ENDANGERED. Also, you will get an alert if any of the service  status is ENDANGERED. It will appear in the Cluster homepage along with other  metric alerts. You can use a notification mechanism such as email, if you want to get  an email. We talked about setting up email as a notification method in Chapter 4,  Managing Oracle WebLogic Server.

You can set up both warning and critical threshold for the Coherence  cluster. Enterprise Manager allows you to select several Coherence metrics, such as  node or cache specific metrics. You can select this by clicking on the Metric and Policy  Settings link from the Coherence cluster page. The following screenshot shows how  you can set the warning and critical threshold. You can set the value for warning and  critical thresholds. EM uses the comparison operator to compare with the warning or  critical threshold and if the comparison evaluates to true then an alert is raised.  Even then you can customize the metric rule to run against a specific monitored target.  For example, you can set a metric threshold for Store Reads Delta only for a specific  cache service, as shown in the previous screenshot. How do you do that? We leave   that as an exercise for you.  A hint: Select Edit and then add Monitored Objects.    Monitoring Coherence node A Coherence node is a JVM process that is a member of Coherence cluster and  it provides a clustered distributed caching service. Therefore, it is important to  monitor the health of the Coherence nodes. From the Coherence Cluster homepage,  you can navigate to the Nodes Performance page, and see the performance of the  top nodes as in the following screenshot:  [ 214 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 10  The top nodes are the nodes that may have potential issues, for example, nodes with  less memory or a large queue size. On this page, only the top nodes are shown. You  can see both the real time and historical metrics. The historical metrics are useful to  perform a trend analysis. You can navigate to the bottom of the page to see all nodes  in a tabular view, as in the following screenshot:  The tabular view provides you with a way to compare how the nodes are performing  compared to each other. However if you have a large number of nodes, it will be  difficult to compare them to each other. We will discuss later in the chapter about  how you can use Enterprise Manager to compare performance and configuration of  two nodes.

You can see the host and metric alert and take the appropriate action. It provides  operations such as stop and reset statistics.  Note that the stop operation does not actually stop the JVM process  running the node but it evicts the node from the cluster. For example,   you may decide to stop evict the node if you find out that the node is   not performing to expectations. When you evict the node, it will   depart the node and it may join back later. When a node departs or joins   a cluster, the cached data automatically gets repartitioned and the data  gets redistributed.  You can navigate to the Performance page of a cluster to view the performance  details for the cluster. The Performance page for the cluster provides several crucial  metrics that indicate the health of the node such as gets, puts, memory available,  stored reads, and so on, for the last 24 hours or the selected period.

Monitoring Coherence cache Coherence cache is the most important aspect of the cluster. Coherence provides  a distributed caching service, and applications read and store objects from these  caches, without having to know about the actual location of this data. A cache may  be distributed across multiple storage nodes or JVMs and each of these are called  cache partitions. Enterprise Manager provides excellent capabilities to monitor  caches. You can navigate to the cache performance page.  By default, you will see the top five caches compared to each other and you can  change the view by all caches or view by nodes.

The Performance  page shows the performance of each cache's partitions compared to the other, as  shown in the following figure:   You can compare usage, performance, and throughputs for each cache   partition. This helps you to quickly gauge how nodes are performing and   take remedial steps.  Monitoring connections and connections  managers You can monitor the health of connections and connection managers using  Enterprise Manager. This provides you with an insight into the health of proxy  connections. You can monitor each connection and how these are using the   cluster. For example, one particular connection may be overloading the cluster   with too much data and this may be it slowing down. You can find out who the  client is, as Enterprise Manager can help you to find the IP address and you can   even choose to close the connection.  We leave navigating and monitoring of connections and connection managers as an  exercise for you to complete in your own time.

Think about the case where, for example, you rolled out  some changes to the cache configurations of your storage nodes and, by mistake,  you did not propagate that change to one node and that node is not performing  as expected. You can then use the compare configuration feature. You can access  this either using the Administration link from the Coherence cluster page or each  component page, for example node or cache. You can select the two nodes or caches  to compare and you will see the comparison as in the following page:  You can compare both configuration and performance between two nodes and track  down the difference between them.

You can navigate to the real-time configuration change page,  either by navigating to Administration link from your component homepage, or the  cluster homepage. For example, the following figure shows the configuration change  for a node.  You can change a configuration for example, log level for a node. You can even  propagate this change to the entire cluster. You have to be careful as some changes  may slow down the performance of the cluster.  Note that these changes are for real-time only and do not get persisted.  The changes are only temporary and are lost when a node is restarted.  Provisioning the Coherence cluster Your cluster may have a large number of nodes and you may be adding new nodes  to the cluster depending on the increasing load on your cluster. Enterprise Manager  can help you automate the provisioning of Coherence cluster. You can either  provision a completely new cluster or add new nodes to the cluster by using the  Coherence provisioning deployment procedure. You can schedule the coherence  node provisioning by selecting it from the homepage.

The Coherence provisioning deployment procedure can install Coherence, copy your  application binaries, cache configuration files and startup scripts and start a new  coherence node.  You have to upload your coherence binaries, startup script, application jars, and so  on to the software library.  You can schedule a Coherence node provisioning deployment procedure by selecting  the appropriate deployment procedure. You have to first select the appropriate  source in the first step, as shown in the following screenshot:   In this step, you can select the appropriate software components such as the  application components that you need as a part of your Coherence node.  Then you can choose whether you want to add a new node to the cluster or add a  completely new cluster. For example, if you have a test cluster and you want to move  that to UAT or the production environment you can chose this option. When you  add a new Coherence cluster, it is automatically discovered by Enterprise Manager.

In this step, you have to select the  hosts where you want to provision new nodes, number of nodes, and node types,   as shown in the following screenshot:  You have to enter the home directory and the path of the startup script that will be  used to start the node. If you have selected more than one node, then Enterprise  Manager will automatically derive the names and the home directory.   We recommend that you enter the node details such as Site Name, Role  Name, and Rack Name even if these are optional parameters. These  parameters are used to uniquely identify a node, as the node number is  dynamic in nature and gets changed whenever it gets started or rejoins  the cluster.  After entering these details you can schedule the deployment. The deployment  procedure will run and then provision the node or cluster. The deployment  procedure framework is extensible in nature, for example you can build a new  procedure to roll out application patches to all the nodes in your cluster.

In this chapter, we learnt how to discover a Coherence cluster from  Enterprise Manager. You can now monitor a Coherence cluster either by using a   local or remote management agent. Bulk Operation Mbean is recommended for  better performance in metrics collection and aggregation when you have a large  number of Coherence nodes. Enterprise Manager monitors Coherence cluster by  talking to a single management node. We can use Enterprise Manager to monitor  the health and performance of Coherence cluster and learned how to monitor and  diagnose issues in different entities such as nodes, caches, services, and so on. We  also learned configuration comparison and rolling out real-time configuration  changes. We can use Coherence node provisioning feature to create a new   Coherence cluster or add new nodes to an existing Coherence cluster.  Today heterogeneous systems are very common and you would expect that there  will be some non-Oracle middleware in your IT shop. In the next chapter, we will  learn how you can monitor a third-party middleware such as IBM, Websphere,   Jboss, or Microsoft Middleware. So, see you there!

The Service Oriented Architecture has become popular because it  simplifies the integration of several heterogeneous platforms and systems. Even if  you primarily run on Oracle software you may get some non-Oracle middleware  platforms along with a packaged application or due to a merger acquisition with  another company. You would expect that the management solution that you  implement will help you to monitor your non-Oracle middleware and databases.   You may remember from our discussion that Oracle Enterprise Manager provides   an extensible mechanism known as plug-in architecture to build additional  monitoring capabilities.  In this chapter, we will learn how Oracle Enterprise Manager provides you with the  ability to manage non-Oracle middleware.  You will learn about the following:           Monitoring of open source middleware Apache HTTP Server, Tomcat,  and JBoss Application Server Monitoring of IBM WebSphere Application Server and   IBM WebSphere MQ Monitoring of Microsoft middleware such as Microsoft IIS, .NET,   and so on  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Non-Oracle Middleware  Non-Oracle middleware support We can broadly categorize non-Oracle middleware into two categories. The  middleware platform that is primarily popular with Java applications and also   with software that has been built using the Microsoft platform.   Oracle provides two types of plug-ins to monitor non-Oracle software:   	 The first type of plug-ins are integrated with Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid   Control and do not require a separate installation.    	 Some of the plug-ins are released separately in Oracle Technology Network,   and require installation. Let's refer to these types of plug-ins as standard   plug-ins.  The following screenshot shows an instance of Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid  Control managing non-Oracle middleware, which is being being monitored along  with Oracle middleware installations:  [ 226 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   It is evident from the previous screenshot that Oracle Enterprise Manager supports  a large amount of middleware such as JBoss Application Server, Microsoft IIS, .Net,  Active Directory, IBM WebSphere, and JBoss Application Server. The following   table shows the names of the plug-ins and their types. For the actual version of   these supported products, check the certification matrix in My Oracle Support.

Your  organizations may be using Apache HTTP Server as the web server for your  applications. For example, many customers use Apache HTTP Server as the load  balancer for WebLogic Server. Even Oracle HTTP Server is based on the Apache  HTTP Server. However, Oracle HTTP Server is significantly pre-instrumented  for performance monitoring and is automatically discovered when an Oracle  Application Server instance is discovered.  Let us discuss how you can discover Apache HTTP Server from Enterprise Manager.  In order to discover Apache HTTP Server, you have to navigate to the Agent page  for the host where Apache HTTP Server is running and then, from the Add drop- down list select Apache HTTP Server, as shown in the following figure:   [ 228 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   After you click on Go, you will be prompted by the discovery page, as shown in  the following screenshot. You have to enter the details for the HTTP server. Only  the paths to the config file directory and bin directory are required. The other  parameters are optional, and required only when you want to use the End-User  Monitoring feature. Oracle recommends using another product named Oracle Real  User Experience Insight to monitor the end-user experience.  Chapter 11  After you complete these details, the Apache HTTP Server will be discovered.   You should avoid this approach to discover Oracle HTTP Server because  although Oracle HTTP Server is a variant of Apache HTTP Server it has  been pre-instrumented by Oracle and is automatically discovered with  Oracle Application Server.  You can monitor the health of Apache HTTP Server and get notified when the   server goes down. Note the generic Apache HTTP Server is not pre-instrumented  and hence Grid Control cannot provide a lot of performance metrics similar to Oracle  HTTP Server.   For that reason, we recommend that you use Oracle HTTP Server instead  of Apache HTTP Server.

Besides the status monitoring, Enterprise Manager provides configuration  management capabilities. You can view the configuration details for an Apache  HTTP Server or compare it with a previous version or another server. You can   access these details from the homepage.  Managing Apache Tomcat Apache Tomcat is a very popular open source web container to deploy Java EE based  web applications. Enterprise Manager Grid Control provides a plug-in to monitor  Apache Tomcat Server. Unlike plug-ins for other non-Oracle application servers such  as JBoss or IBM Websphere, the plug-in for Apache is not integrated and you have to  install the plug-in on your Grid Control and deploy it to the agents that monitor the  Tomcat servers.  Oracle provides several plug-ins in the Oracle Technology Network. You can  download the plug-in to monitor Tomcat Server from the following location:   http  www.oracle.com technology software products oem htdocs plugin- apache_tomcat.html. In this chapter, we will learn how to install the Tomcat   plug-in and then monitor the Tomcat server.

Then you  have to install the plug-in on your Oracle Management Server. To install a plug-in  you have to perform the following steps:     Login to Grid Control as a Super Administrator    Navigate to Setup  Management Plug-ins  Connectors and then select   Add Import Management Plug-ins In the Import Management Plug-ins page, click on Browse... to select the  tomcat_plugin.jar file that you downloaded earlier, and then click on  List Archive and you will see the Tomcat plug-in details, as shown in the  following screenshot:         Click OK to install the Tomcat plug-in and you will get a confirmation   message that the plug-in was installed     You have to deploy the plug-in to the management agents that you want to   use to monitor Tomcat  Note that each plug-in adds one or more target type and  the management agent has no knowledge of the target type.  Therefore, the metadata files for the target types need to be  pushed to each agent that will monitor the new target-types,  for example in our case it is Tomcat.

Discovering Tomcat Server You have to enable JMX in your Tomcat server to discover and monitor from Oracle  Enterprise Manager. You have to modify the start script for your Tomcat server to  enable JMX Mbean server. To enable JMX, you have to add the following parameters  to your startup script:  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true \     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=%my.jmx.port% \     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \     -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false  [ 232 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Look at the Tomcat documentation at http:  tomcat.apache.org tomcat-5.5- doc monitoring.html for details about enabling JMX and options that make sense  with respect to your environment. To discover a Tomcat server from Grid Control, you have to navigate to the All  Targets page, and then click on Add Apache Tomcat Server, and you will get the  discovery screen, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 11  You have to enter the name of the Host where Tomcat server is running, and the JMX  Port Number that you specified when you enabled JMX for your Tomcat server. If  you used any advanced JMX configurations for your server, you have to enter those  while discovering your Tomcat server.  After you confirm, the Tomcat Server will be discovered. If you enter any incorrect  configuration, you will get errors while navigating to the Tomcat homepage. You  have to use the Monitoring Configuration link to modify the configuration details  before you can monitor the Tomcat servers.  The monitoring of Apache Tomcat is similar to any other targets and we leave that  for you as an exercise to complete in your own time.

You may remember from our discussion in Chapter 9,  Managing Identity Manager Suite, that some Fusion Middleware components such  as Oracle Identity Manager Server runs on JBoss Application Server and you may  be running OIM on JBoss AS. In this section, we will learn about the discovery and  monitoring of JBoss Application Server.  Ensure that you have enabled JMX for your JBoss Application Server  for monitoring with Enterprise Manager Grid Control. You have to also  ensure that Jboss application server is enabled with JSR 77 management.  This requires the MEJB application to be deployed.   The Java options to enable JMX are similar to those for Tomcat that we learnt about  in the previous section. Please refer to JBoss server documentation for complete   start-up options.  You can either have a local or remote agent to monitor JBoss Application Server. You  have to copy the relevant JBoss client JAR files to the agent location if the agent is  running in a remote location. Launch the JBoss discovery page either from the All Targets page or   Middleware Targets page by selecting JBoss Application Server on the Add   Target drop-down menu, and clicking on Go and you will get the discovery page,   as in the following screenshot:   [ 234 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 11  If the agent is on the same machine then you have to enter the install home for JBoss.  Ensure that the operating system user that owns the management agent has read  and executed privileges on the JBoss binaries. If the agent is running on a remote box  then copy the required JAR files to the agent box. You need the following JAR files to  be copied to the library path: jboss-management.jar, jnp-client.jar, jbossall- client.jar, and dom4j.jar. You have to enter the port number for the JNDI Port that the agent will communicate  with to monitor the server. The Username and Password fields are optional and are  required only if you have enabled security credentials for JBoss server.  On the next page, you have to enter the credentials for the agent host and then  confirm selection and this should discover the JBoss Servers running on the host and  then on confirmation it will add the JBoss Server to Enterprise Manager. You can see the JBoss Application Server by navigating to All targets  Middleware.  You can monitor the JBoss Application Server by navigating to its homepage, as  shown in the following screenshot:  If you see the status of the JBoss Application Server immediately after the discovery,  then it may be shown as down. If you see the status to be down, then recycle the  Management Agent.  You can monitor the health and performance of JBoss Application Server from  Enterprise Manager. Enterprise Manager provides several performance metrics for  applications, services, and resource usage. We leave the monitoring tasks, such as  setting thresholds or generating reports, as an exercise for you.

Those are IBM WebSphere Application Server and IBM WebSphere MQ. IBM  WebSphere Application Server is one of the leading Java EE application servers in  the market, whereas IBM WebSphere MQ is a very popular messaging provider.  Your organization may be using either of these software along with other Oracle  middleware. For example, Oracle SOA Suite may be deployed on IBM WebSphere.  We will first learn about the discovery, monitoring, and configuration management  aspects of IBM WebSphere Application Server and then IBM WebSphere MQ.  Managing IBM WebSphere Application Server Oracle Enterprise Manager uses JMX to monitor IBM WebSphere Application Server,  which is similar to other Java EE servers. When you discover a WebSphere Cell, it  automatically discovers servers and clusters in the cell. An IBM WebSphere Cell is  analogous to a WebLogic Server Domain. Note that Enterprise Manager monitors  only servers and clusters and does not monitor agents required by WebSphere such  as a node agent.   You can monitor an IBM WebSphere Application Server Cell either using a local or  remote management agent. The agent can be running on the same or different host  where WebSphere deployment manager is running. The agent host should be   able to communicate with the deployment manager host. Check the certification  matrix at My Oracle Support  https:  metalink.oracle.com  for the versions   of WebSphere supported from Enterprise Manager.  If your agent is local to the deployment manager host then you have to make sure  that the agent user has read and executed privileges on the WebSphere binaries.  If the agent is remote, then you have to copy the client JAR files i.e. com.ibm. ws.admin.client_6.1.0.jar and com.ibm.ws.runtime_6.1.0.jar. The discovery mechanism for WebSphere is similar to other middleware and   you can invoke the discovery screen from middleware target page by selecting  Add IBM WebSphere Cell. You will get the the discovery screen, as shown in the  following page:  [ 236 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 11  In this environment, our agent is remotely located and we have copied all client JAR  files to  mylibrary ibmwas lib directory.  After you enter the appropriate value during the interview phase and then credentials  for the agent host, Enterprise Manager will retrieve all servers and clusters. You can  choose those servers or clusters that you want to manage from Grid Control.  Note that the servers that you want to monitor from Enterprise Manager  should be Up during the discovery process. If you add a new server or  cluster to a previously discovered cell, make sure that you refresh the cell  by clicking on Refresh IBM WebSphere Cell from its homepage.  Enterprise Manager provides capabilities to monitor the performance of WebSphere  Application Servers, resources, and applications. It also provides configuration  management capabilities, such as configuration tracking and comparison. Enterprise  Manager allows you to configure threshold settings for several metrics and you can  use alert notification for any other middleware targets such as WebLogic Server.   We leave exploring these functionalities for WebSphere as an exercise for you   to complete.

It is highly likely that you may be using  WebSphere MQ with WebLogic Server or Oracle Fusion Middleware SOA Suite.  Enterprise Manager allows you to discover and monitor WebSphere MQ.  In this section, we will the learn about the discovery mechanism for WebSphere MQ.  You can either use an agent running on the same host where IBM WebSphere MQ is  installed, or on a remote host.  You can navigate to the the Websphere MQ discovery screen by clicking on Add  IBM WebSphere MQ from the All Targets page. The following screenshot shows the discovery screen for WebSphere MQ:  Most of the fields in the discovery screen are self-explanatory, except the Jar Path.  Unlike other middleware where we provided the directory that contained all of the  JAR files, this WebSphere MQ discovery requires the complete classpath as shown  next as an example:  %MQ_HOME% eclipse plugins com.ibm.mq.pcf_6.0.0 pcf.jar:%MQ_HOME%  Java lib com.ibm.mq.jar  [ 238 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   It will discover the Queue Manager Clusters, Queue Managers, Queues, and  Channels for the WebSphere MQ install. You can monitor performance of these  components and make the most of the benefits of most of the Grid Control features  such as historical performance metrics, alert notification, and so on. We leave you to  do these as an exercise.  Chapter 11  Best practices for managing non-Oracle  Java middleware Now that we have concluded the management of non-Oracle Java middleware, here  are some best practices that we recommend to get the best out of Enterprise Manager.           You can monitor multiple installs of non-Oracle middleware targets running  on multiple hosts from a single agent. If you are monitoring a large number  of application server targets, do not use the agent to monitor more than 25-30  application server instances. Do not use an agent to monitor different types of Java targets, for example  do not use an agent to monitor both JBoss Application Server and IBM  WebSphere. The agent communicates with the application servers using  JMX and requires client-side JAR files provided by application servers and  there could be conflicting classes that could cause classloading errors at the  agent side. This will result in metric collection error. Avoid monitoring different versions of the same application server from the  same agent, unless your application server supports connecting to different  versions using the same client JAR files.  Managing Microsoft Middleware Many organizations use heterogeneous software platforms. The Service Oriented  Architecture allows integration between heterogeneous platforms. For example, if  you have built a service using a Microsoft platform, you will be able to consume  that service in Oracle Fusion Middleware. Also, you may be using Microsoft Active  Directory as the LDAP provider for your Identity Management Suite. So, there is a  likelihood that your organization may be using Microsoft’s Middleware platform.  As we discussed earlier, Oracle provides several plug-ins to monitor Microsoft  middleware such as Microsoft .NET, IIS, Active Directory, and so on.   [ 239 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Non-Oracle Middleware  You have to download the appropriate plug-in from Oracle Technology  Network at http:  www.oracle.com technology software  products oem htdocs system-monitoring-connectors.html.  Oracle recommends that you use the latest plug-in available.   Installing Plug-ins Each plug-in is available separately and needs to be installed separately. For   example, if you want to monitor Active Directory and IIS, then you have to  download the plug-ins for both Active Directory and IIS separately and install   those on Grid Control.  We learnt about installing the Tomcat plug-in earlier in this chapter. Just to recap,  following are the steps to install a plug-in that you can use for Microsoft middleware:  1.  Download the plug-in JAR file from OTN to your local desktop 2.  Login to Grid Control as a Super Administrator 3.  Navigate to Setup  Management Plug-in and Connectors, and then select   Add Import Management Plug-in In the Import Management Plug-in page, click on Browse to select the  respective plug-in JAR file, for example microsoft_active_directory_ plugin.jar that you downloaded earlier, and then click on Archive and you  will see the plug-in details  4.   5.  Click OK to install the plug-in, and you will get a confirmation message   saying that the plug-in was installed  6.  You have to deploy the plug-in to those management agents that you want to   use to monitor the respective target  Discovery of Microsoft middleware     You can add new instances of Microsoft middleware, for example Active  Directory or IIS or .NET Server from Grid Control. Discovery of each of these  servers requires installation of the appropriate plug-in. The discussion of  discovery of each of these targets is beyond the scope of the book and the  steps can be generalized as follows:     Deploy the plug-in to the agent that you want to use to monitor your target.   Most of these targets can be monitored either with a local or remote agent.  [ 240 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com      To discover a target instance, navigate to the Agent page and then select Add   for the appropriate target type, for example Microsoft Active Directory.     This will take you to the Target Discovery page. You have to enter the agent   credentials and target specific information to complete the discovery of   the target.  Chapter 11  Monitoring Microsoft middleware Each Microsoft middleware target has its homepage and performance page that you  can use to monitor the health and performance. For example, the following figure  shows the homepage for Microsoft Active Directory.

Similarly, you can use  Enterprise Manager to set metric thresholds for alert notifications. The following  screenshot shows the metrics available for setting thresholds for Active Directory.   We have discussed these topics numerous times, such as for Oracle WebLogic Server  and this same steps apply here. We leave these for you to explore on your own.  Service Level Monitoring for third-party  targets We discussed Service Level Management earlier in this book. Also, we learnt about  creating service level and service tests in Chapter 4, Managing Oracle WebLogic  Server.You can use Service Level Management features with third-party targets.  For example, you can use the Service Level management feature to monitor service  level of a web application running in JBoss Application Server or service level for an  LDAP search in Microsoft Active Directory.

Create a system for the underlying infrastructure components targets that  provide the service. For example, the Active Directory System includes the  Active Directory Server and the host.  Chapter 11  2.  Create a service, either a generic service or a web application service based  on the service. For example, we have the Active Directory Service which is a  generic service, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 243 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Managing Non-Oracle Middleware  3.  Then you have to define how you measure the availability and performance  of the service. This may depend upon the system availability or on a service  test. For example, we have a service test for LDAP Search that determines the  availability and performance and usage metrics for the service.  4.  You can define the beacons for the service test to measure the availability   from different geographical locations.  5.  You can leverage all reporting capabilities such as system and services   dashboards for services that depend upon non-Oracle middleware.  Summary You can manage broadly three types of middleware with Oracle Enterprise Manager.  These can be classified as open source middleware, IBM, and Microsoft middleware.  Enterprise Manager supports the management of non-Oracle middleware by  providing various plug-ins. Plug-ins for all open source middleware, except  Tomcat, are integrated with Enterprise Manager. You can manage IBM WebSphere  Application Server Cell and Websphere MQ with Enterprise Manager. Enterprise  Manager also provides several plug-ins for managing Microsoft Middleware. You  have to install these plug-ins as a super administrator and deploy them to an agent  before you can monitor a plug-in target. You get all the benefits of alert notification,  historical performance metrics, configuration, and configuration management with  plug-ins. You can also use Service Level Management with third-party targets. In   the next chapter, we will learn how you can diagnose problems in the JVM or   Java EE applications.  [ 244 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Java and Composite  Applications Monitoring   and Diagnostics   Application hangs and performance issues appear in many applications in the  production environment. These problems in production applications cause  availability and service level issues. Diagnosing these application performance issues  is very challenging for application administrators and support personnel. Often  these issues are hard to reproduce in a test and development environment, and  most diagnostic tools are too inadequate to be used in the production environment.  Oracle Enterprise Manager has two products: Composite Application Monitor and  Modeler  CAMM  and Application Diagnostics for Java  AD4J  that are used to  diagnose application issues.   CAMM allows you to diagnose performance issues in composite applications,  whereas AD4J allows you to diagnose issues such as memory leak and application   in Java applications and the underlying JVM.  In this chapter, you will learn how you can effectively use these two tools to  diagnose application issues.  We will discuss the following:            Architecture and components of CAMM Monitoring and diagnosing Java EE and Composite Applications   with CAMM Architecture and components of AD4J Diagnosing Java resource problems with AD4J  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Java and Composite Applications Monitoring and Diagnostics  Composite Application Monitor and   Modeler The modern SOA applications are very complex in nature. They depend on services  either within the application and or external services. These could be either a remote  EJB running on another application server or on a BPEL process or ESB service. Due  to the dynamic nature of today's applications some of the application dependencies  are not defined in deployment descriptors and may be defined using Java annotations  that are buried inside the application code. Therefore, it is difficult to get a complete  understanding of a composite application for administrators and support personnel.  CAMM provides a model-driven diagnostics approach and provides a topological  view of the composite applications by showing the application dependencies. In this  section, we will learn about CAMM, supported products and its architecture, and  how you can use this to diagnose application issues.  The CAMM product was a part of the ClearApp acquisition and is not  yet integrated with Enterprise Manager Grid Control. CAMM has its own  management server, agent, and requires its own repository database and  applet-based management console.  Supported products At the time of writing, CAMM supports several Oracle and non-Oracle middleware  products. Besides the traditional application servers some notable products  supported by CAMM are:               Oracle BPEL Process Manager Oracle Electronic Service Bus Oracle Service Bus aka BEA AquaLogic Service Bus Oracle WebLogic Integration Oracle WebLogic Portal IBM WebSphere Portal  Refer to the certification matrix available on My Oracle Support    http:  metalink.oracle.com  for the latest versions supported products.  CAMM architecture The deployment architecture of CAMM is similar to Oracle Enterprise Manager. If  you look at the deployment architecture for CAMM, it has two primary components:  CAMM server and agent.  [ 246 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 12  The CAMM server constitutes three main components: CAMM manager, database,  and user interface.               The CAMM manager is the core analytical engine, which performs   heavy-duty processing of collected data and enables the user interface   for administration. The CAMM database is the repository used by CAMM manager to store  analyzed data and the application model. The CAMM repository database  can either be an Oracle or MySQL database. The CAMM user interface is the primary administration console used for  monitoring. This is currently a Java applet-based console. The CAMM agent is an application that gets deployed to each managed  application server target such as WebLogic Managed Server or WebSphere  server. The CAMM agent collects data from the managed server and tracks  the contextual relationship and summarizes data in real time.

You have to configure the repository database, install CAMM manager and the  agents. We will provide you with some quick tips about the installation process   but, the detailed coverage of CAMM is beyond the scope of this book. You can install and configure CAMM in two operation modes:  service mode  and application mode. The actual CAMM manager runs as an UNIX daemon or  Windows service in this mode. This is the default mode and recommended for a  production deployment. The UI runs in a web container in this mode.  When you run CAMM in a standalone application mode, the CAMM process is  started and the user interface is rendered automatically. You can use this mode to  quickly debug the problems in a server. The CAMM process is stopped when you  exit the user interface. The actual installation is documented in the CAMM Installation Guide    http:  download.oracle.com docs cd E14670_01 doc.10205 e14147 toc.htm   and we recommend that you review the certification guide for the operating system  requirements and certified targets.  You can download CAMM from Oracle Technology Network at   http:  www.oracle.com technology software products camm index.html.  Here are the few quick tips that you want to follow for the installation:           Install CAMM manager on a dedicated server. It requires a good  processing power to perform mathematical modeling and analyze  application relationship. The CAMM repository database has to be configured prior to the  installation. You can use a separate schema in the EM repository   database as the CAMM repository. The agent installation requires a special setup and privileges in different  application server environments and you have to ensure that you have  those privileges on those targets.  Monitoring and diagnosing Composite  Applications with CAMM You can use CAMM to monitor application performance, service level objects, and to  help you to detect application bottlenecks.

You have to start CAMM manager before you can start the console.   In Windows, you can start the console by accessing the Start CAMM  manager option. In UNIX, you have to start CAMM manager as follows: nohup . $CAMM_INSTALL_DIR bin acsera.sh & You can access the CAMM console in a browser by accessing  https:  hostname:port qvadmin        Note that the default port for CAMM console is 5560, so if you are in the same box  where CAMM manager is running and CAMM is running on the default port, then  you can access the console using https:  localhost:5560 qvadmin  You will get the CAMM console rendered as an applet as follows:  [ 249 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Java and Composite Applications Monitoring and Diagnostics  If the agents are deployed on the servers that you want to monitor, then it will  automatically discover the components and create the nodes as shown in the  previous screenshot. For example, this instance of CAMM has discovered BPEL  processes, ESB, OSB, and so on.  The initial top-level view illustrates all of the active entities being monitored by  CAMM. You can open a specific node e.g. OSB to monitor business services and  proxy services and some important metrics such as arrivals, completions, response  time, and so on, as shown next:  [ 250 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   The most important aspect of monitoring by CAMM is the topological view that  shows the high-level topology, showing the call interactions, both defined and  current, between different services and components they may be invoking. You  can view the topological view of a component by clicking on the topology for that  specific component e.g. OSB Topology will provide a topological view, as shown in  the following screenshot:  Chapter 12  The topology view is great for administrators to understand the actual   application topology. You can further drill down to a specific service by clicking   on a business or proxy service and view the call interactions and diagnose   problems in composite applications.

Application Diagnostics for Java  AD4J  The Application Diagnostics for Java product allows users to diagnose production  issues in Java applications. It helps you to diagnose JVM issues such as thread  deadlock contention and memory leak. The AD4J product was acquired from   a small privately held company named Auptyma, and this is still a standalone  product with its own installer.  AD4J Architecture The architecture of AD4J product is similar to EM Grid control. The management  console runs on Apache JServ and it requires a database repository. You can either  use an Oracle database and PostgresSQL as the repository. You have to install an  agent in the JVM or application server to monitor the JVM process. The agent is a  WAR file that you can deploy to the server. If you want the correlation between the  application server JVM and the database tier, you have to install the database agent  in the database host.

The database agent is supported only  on UNIX platforms.  Installation and configuration AD4J Console is supported only on Windows 32-bit, Linux, and Solaris platforms.  The agents are supported on numerous JVMs. The AD4J agents are for a very specific  version of JVM and you have to check the certification matrix to verify whether your  JVM is certified. You can download AD4J from OTN from the following location:   http:  www.oracle.com technology software products oem htdocs   jade.html  The installation of AD4J Console is straightforward and is documented in the  AD4J Install Guide at http:  download.oracle.com docs cd B16240_01 doc  install.102 e11085 toc.htm. The installation steps require you to create the  database schema and tables.  Starting up AD4J Console As we discussed earlier, AD4J Console runs on Apache JServ, and hence, you need to  start the Apache HTTP Server to access the AD4J Console.  In UNIX Linux, you can start AD4J Console as follows:  $AD4J_HOME jamserv bin apachectl start  The console runs on the default port of 3500, and you can access the AD4J Console at  http:  hostname:3500  If the AD4J repository is not created configured, AD4J Console will prompt you for  the connection details about the DB repository and create the database objects.

You can download the agent from  AD4J Console by clicking on the download AD4J agent menu. You can select the  appropriate agent, and then deploy the agent into your application server using the  appropriate deployment tool for your server. For example, if you are using Oracle  WebLogic Server, you can deploy jamagent.war using WebLogic   Server Console.   If you are running multiple managed servers in a WebLogic Server Domain, you  have to activate the application in all managed servers that you want to monitor  from AD4J. The JVM process for the application server is automatically discovered   in the AD4J Console as soon as the agent is deployed.  If your application accesses an Oracle database, the AD4J agent allows  you to perform cross-tier tracing to the Oracle database. The DB agent is  only supported in UNIX platforms.

You can see several important metrics such as CPU usage, locks, database,and  network waits, top requests, and methods. The cost indicates the number of method  invocations and requests. You will see various metrics for each of JVM being  monitored. The following table shows the description for each of these metrics:  Metric Name CPU OSR  Mem Run DB Lock Net Obj wait Sleep  Description CPU utilization on the JVM. OS indicator of how quickly you can get the CPU  when you need it. The percentage of the JVM Heap used. Threads using the CPU. Threads waiting for DB activity to complete. Thread waiting for the JVM synchronization lock. Threads waiting for Network Activity. Idle Threads, which have called Network Wait. Idle Threads, which are sleeping.  There is much compelling JVM data provided by AD4J that may feel unimportant to  you as an administrator, but they may be very useful for developers. You can look  at the detailed usage scenarios of AD4J at http:  www.oracle.com technology  products oem pdf oraclead4j_usagescenarios.pdf.

If your application appears hanging or running slow, you can view the active threads  or the threads waiting for Lock or DB Wait for the JVM. You can view all active  threads and see their status, as shown next:   Chapter 12  [ 257 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Java and Composite Applications Monitoring and Diagnostics  You can then click on the thread name to view the call stack for a thread and find the  methods being invoked. This will be useful for developers in order to find the line of  code being executed.   You can drill down to the method and see its details. You can view and diagnose if  a method is executing any JDBC SQL statement. In the next section, we will discuss,  how you can use AD4J.

You can view the call stack trace by lock or by percent and AD4J will display the  percentage elapsed for each method. You can quickly find out the culprit method  that is taking an unusually long time.   Tracing a thread You can trace an active thread and diagnose problems in the thread. You can click   on the trace link on an active thread and specify the poll interval. AD4J will trace   the thread and then view the result for the trace. You can find CPU utilization,   heap usage, and garbage collection time; thread state and request state,   as shown in the following figure:   [ 259 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Java and Composite Applications Monitoring and Diagnostics Cross-tier diagnostics You can diagnose the application problem that is due to a problem in the database  tier. For example, your Enterprise Java applications may be running slowly either  because the SQL is taking an unusually long time to execute, because of a full table  scan or there is a network issue. If a thread is waiting for a JDBC call to return, you  will see the state as DB Wait.   You can drill down and view the SQL statement that is being executed. It further  allows you to run the explain plan to see if the SQL statement is causing any full  table scan.

You can take heap dumps at two  different times and compare those and detect memory leak. The following shows a  comparison between two different heaps:  Chapter 12  AD4J provides several interesting features such as tracing active thread capabilities  and we leave that as an exercise for you to explore.  Summary In this chapter you learned about the monitoring and diagnostics for composite  applications and Java resource problems. The Composite Application Monitor  and Modeler  CAMM  provides a model-driven diagnostics approach to diagnose  Composite Applications whereas AD4J allows you to diagnose JVM resource  problems by providing a deep diagnostics approach. Besides monitoring production  applications, these products can be handy for you during the development and  testing phase. In the next chapter, you will learn how to use extensibility features of  Enterprise Manager. We will demonstrate by creating a monitoring plug-in for Sun  Java Web Server.

We learned that Enterprise Manager  provides a centralized console for the monitoring and managing of the whole data  center. We saw that Enterprise Manager provides a monitoring and management  support for many commonly used middleware platforms and applications. There are  a lot of middleware products and platforms on the market and there can be products  where Enterprise Manager doesn't provide monitoring and management support  out-of-the-box. To support centralized management for such products, Enterprise  Manager provides an extensibility framework. Using this framework, vendors of  other products and end-users can add management support where not available.  Management support built using an extensibility framework is packaged as a  monitoring plug-in. These plug-ins can be deployed an existing Enterprise Manager  installation. There are many plug-ins available from the Oracle website—some   built by Oracle; others built by third party vendors. These plug-ins provide  monitoring support for Microsoft SQL server, Checkpoint Firewall, NetApp Filer,  and many other products. For a complete list of plug-ins, please refer to the Oracle  website.  http:  www.oracle.com technology products oem extensions  index.html   To build such a monitoring support, you will need to learn how to build a  management plug-in. In this chapter, we'll see the steps and artefacts required   to build a monitoring plug-in. We will be building this monitoring plug-in for   Sun Java Web Server.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Building Your Monitoring Plug-in  But the overall objective of this chapter is to learn about the extensibility framework  of Enterprise Manager. It'll help if you know about the basic usage and architecture  of SUN Java Web Server or any other Web Server, but no need to worry if you  don't—we'll start with an overview of Sun Java Web Server.   In this chapter, we'll cover:                 A brief introduction of Sun Java Web Server. We'll introduce you to SUN  Java WebServer, typical usage, and deployment  The working of plug-ins—plug-in artefacts, deployment, and lifecycle An exercise—monitor Sun Java Web Server by deploying some sample files  from the code bundle Overview of the artefacts used for monitoring in the exercise Packaging and deploying the plug-in Advance features of plug-in  Introducing Sun Java Web Server A web server serves content using the HTTP protocol. The web server receives client  requests over HTTP protocol and responds back in HTTP protocol. The web server  can serve static or dynamic content based on configuration and software associated  with the web server deployment.  In a typical production environment, the web server acts as a gateway for all of the  incoming traffic. Usually, all static content including HTML and images are stored  on the same host where the web server is running. Any request for this static content  is served by the web server over HTTP. For dynamic content, the web server passes   a request to some application server; the application server generates and returns   dynamic content to the web server, and the web server delivers it back to the client   over HTTP protocol.  The web server also provides support for secure transmission by providing  encryption over HTTP protocol. The web server supports SSL over HTTP for  communication between the client and the web server, and if the web server is a  separate host to the application server then it may also use SSL for communication  between the web server and the application server or servers.  Besides serving the purpose of HTTP gateway, Sun Java Web Server provides some  more services such as support for executing servlets based applications, and so on. It  also provides high availability support through clustering.

In this deployment, we'll have one  instance of admin server and one instance of web server. Admin server is used to  manage the configuration of one or more web servers.  Chapter 13  How plug-ins work We learnt in Chapter 1, Enterprise Manager Grid Control, about targets, target  metadata, and target collection file. Target is an entity managed by the Enterprise  Manager Grid Control. For each target type there is a target metadata file that defines  the properties for the target, the metrics that need to be collected for a target and  the mechanism to collect those metrics. For each target type there is a collection file  that defines at what frequency metrics should be collected and at what frequency  metrics should be persisted. You may want to revisit Chapter 3, Enterprise Manager  Key Concepts and Subsystems, before we continue with this chapter. Once you have  familiarized yourself about the purpose of these entities, let's use them to see how  plug-ins work.  Plug-in artefacts There are two types of artefacts for a plug-in:   1.  Mandatory artefacts: Target metadata and Target collection are the   mandatory artefacts; with these artefacts all of the monitoring metrics   can be collected, but very limited monitoring interface will be available.  2.  Optional artefacts: Optional artefacts are used to provide enhanced         monitoring interfaces like extra charts on the homepage, or a report linked  from the homepage. The following type of optional artefacts can be defined:  Charts Definition file:  Using this file you can define what metrics you  want to show on time series charts, you can define the types of charts,  height, width of charts and so on Reports Definition file s :  You can define some SQL, using that,   reports on historical metric data can be made available from   the target homepage Jobs Definition file s :  You can define jobs that can be scheduled   from the Enterprise Manager Grid Control Scripts Binary executable: You can package some scripts,  executable—these scripts executable can be used to fetch   monitoring metrics or perform some operation through the   job system        [ 265 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Building Your Monitoring Plug-in  Management Plug-in Archive  MPA  All the artefacts for a plug-in can be packaged in an archive; this archive forms the  basic deployment unit of management plug-in functionality. This archive is referred  to as Management Plug-in Archive or MPA. Enterprise Manager provides a utility  to build MPA from all the artefacts. Management server recognizes the format of this  JAR file. This JAR file can be shared between developers. All the plug-ins available  from Oracle website are available only in this format.  Plug-ins can be versioned—this helps to keep track of various versions of plug-ins,  just like any other software module and is highly recommended.  Plug-in deployment You can import a plug-in on the Management server using the import interface  provided by the Enterprise Manager Console. Once this plug-in is imported onto   the Management Server you can further deploy it onto one or more agents.  Monitoring targets using a plug-in Once the plug-in is deployed on a management server and agents—you can add a  target by using the Add Target feature provided on the agent homepage. To use this  generic UI you need to select the type of target that you want to add and provide the  required properties. For example, if you want to monitor a web server you will need  to provide the URL, using Agent can monitor the availability of the web server.  Exercise—monitor Sun Java Web Server  In this exercise, we will monitor Sun Java Web Server using some sample code  available with the book. After the exercise in the next section, we'll describe the   code used for this exercise.  Pre-requisites You will need a setup of Enterprise Manager Grid Control. Besides the Enterprise  Manager setup, you will need one more host where you can install Sun Java Web  Server. On the additional host you will need to install an additional agent. You may  want to refer to Chapter 2 for this installation.

The steps  to build that monitoring support were:        Copy required artefacts on agent side. These artefacts included a metadata  file, collection file, and the script to get the monitoring data. Discover the web server target by providing required details. These details  included the web server install directory, admin server host and port.  Let's spend some time understanding the artefacts that we used for this exercise. In  the next section, we'll learn about those artefacts.  Overview of artefacts used for   monitoring of Sun Java Web Server Now, we have seen how to monitor the Sun Java Web Server with the code sample  provided with the book. Let's spend some time to understand the code sample that  we used in the exercise.  Target definition First, we need to find out what is the runtime entity or process that we want  to monitor. A very basic set up of Sun Java Web Server has an Admin Server  process and a Web Server process. The Admin Server process can be used only for  administration and it doesn't serve any content or application service. The web  server process is used for serving content to the real end-user. So, the web server  process is the entity that we want to monitor, as this impacts content delivery for   the end-user.  You will remember from the earlier chapters that all managed entities should be  modeled as a target, so we will model the web server process as a target.   The first step of target modeling is naming the target type; we need an internal name  and an external name. The internal name is a unique string that will represent the  unique target type, and the external name is an end-user friendly name that explains  about the target type. For this exercise, we will use sun_javawebserver as an  internal name and SUN Java Webserver as the external name.

For this exercise, we'll define following attributes for Sun Java Web Server:                         Target Name: The name of the target Installation Directory: The directory where the web server is installed Admin Server Host: The hostname ip-address where Admin Server   is running Admin Server Port: communication port of Admin Server Admin Server User: User-ID to authenticate with Admin Server Password file:  File that contains the password to authenticate with Admin  Server. Please refer to the web server documentation for more details on this Configuration Name:  Name of configuration used by the web server Node Name: Name of node where the web server is running Test URL: The URL to check if the web server is up  In subsequent sections, well see how these properties can be defined in the required  XML format.  Target metrics Then next step is to define the metrics and mechanism to get those metrics. The  most import metric for a managed entity target is the Status metric. Status metric  indicates whether the target is up or not.   Some targets expose the status metric; for some targets we need to derive the  status metric by performing some operation on the target. For the web server, we'll  calculate the Status metric by accessing a URL on the web server, if URL access is  successful we can say that the web server is up and serving content. We also learnt in Chapter 3, Enterprise Manager Key Concepts and Subsystems, about  fetchlets—fetchlets provide the mechanism for gathering metrics. There are different  fetchlets out-of-the-box for gathering metrics using different protocol. For gathering  the status metric of the web server we'll use URLTiming fetchlet. This fetchlet takes  web server URL as input and returns the status of URL by accessing it over   HTTP protocol.

For this  exercise, we will capture various metrics for each virtual server that include:                  Total Number of requests served by the virtual server  Total Number of bytes served by the virtual server Total Number of Errors Total Number of 4XX errors—i.e. error codes between 500 and 599 Total Number of 404 errors—since 404 indicate all the unknown URLs Total Number of 5XX errors—i.e. error codes between 500 and 599 Total Number of 200 requests – requests served with 200 code – 200 code  represents success in HTTP protocol.  These metrics are exposed through the wadm utility of the web server. We'll use  OSLineToken Fetchlet to capture these metrics. For more details on wadm utility,  please refer to the web server documentation on the Sunwebsite.  Target artefacts  So far, we have defined the target model, metrics, and the mechanism to gather those  metrics. The next step is to put that definition and metrics in artefacts that can be  deployed through Enterprise Manager.   Usually, all of these artefacts are packaged and uploaded to the management server  and the management server deploys artefacts to different directories on the agent.   During the development time we need to put these artefacts manually into a  different location. We saw this in the previous section where we copied the metadata  file and other files into various locations. Once we have tested these artefacts we can  package them using the command line utility provided by Enterprise Manager.  Target metadata The metadata file name should be the same as the internal name for the target so,  in our case the metadata file name is sun_javawebserver.xml. This metadata file  needs to be copied in the sysman\admin\metadata folder in the EM agent, Oracle  Home. If you want to write this metadata file from scratch we suggest that you copy  one of the existing metadata files in sysman\admin\metadata folder and make the  changes to that file to suit your needs.

At a broad level, metadata  file can be defined in three sections the top section that has some details about the  target type and version, the metric section that defines the metrics to be collected  and mechanism to collect those metrics, and the properties section that defines the  attributes required by a target. Top section This section declares what dtd is used for validating the structure of the metadata  file. It also defines the internal name, external name and version of metadata file.  Internal names are defined by TYPE attribute, the external name is defined by  DISPLAY element, and the metadata version is defined by META_VER attribute. The  following code snippet shows the top section of the sample file from the code bundle:             SUN Java Webserver     Please note META_VER indicates the version of target metadata  – whenever you make changes to the metadata file please increase this  number. For example you can start with number 1.0 and continue with 1.1  or 1.2 and so forth.   Metric section  Each metric defines a group of performance indicators for a given target. These  indicators are represented as columns under metrics. For each metric we need to  For each metric we need to  define all of the columns for the metric and mechanism to gather the metrics. The  mechanism to collect metrics is defined in QueryDescriptor tag through   FETCHLET_ID attribute.   [ 275 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Building Your Monitoring Plug-in  The most important performance indicator for any target is the status of that target;  we'll first model this indicator. We'll define a metric called Response which will  have the status of performance indicator. A web server status is up when you can  access the web server URL using HTTP protocol. To find the status of the web server  we'll use URLTiming fetchlet, this fetchlet will access web server URL periodically  to check the web server status. In the following code snippet that is taken from  a sample metadata file, you will see the metric definition that includes all of the  columns and the fetchlet to be used.             Response              <ColumnDescriptor NAME="Timing" TYPE="NUMBER" IS_KEY="FALSE"                        TRANSIENT="TRUE">                  Test URL response time                                        UpDown Status                             TestURL       0       y         Besides Response metric we have another metric VirtualServerStats that  is a group of virtual host performance indicators. For this metric we are using  OSLineToken fetchlet. Through this fetchlet a perl script is invoked, this perl   script gets metrics for all virtual servers, and prints into a format that can be parsed  by OSLineToken fetchlet. This script is also part of a plug-in and needs to be  deployed in the sysman\admin\scripts\emx\ sun_javawebserver folder under  EM Agent Oracle Home. You can get that script from the sample code bundle.

The following listing shows two such properties; the first property is the  URL for the web server that can be accessed to find the status of the web server. The  next property is the install directory for the web server.   Chapter 13                     Test URL                             Installation Directory             Target collection The collection file name should be the same as the internal name for the target so  the metadata file name is sun_javawebserver.xml. The collection file needs to be  copied in the sysman\admin\default_collection folder in EM agent Oracle Home.   Now we will visit each section of the collection file—you can write your own  collection file or use a sample collection file available as part of the code bundle. On  a broad level, the collection of each metric can be defined in two sections—the first  section defines the collection frequency and upload frequency. The second section  defines the mathematical operators to be used for Metric threshold evaluation.  Collection schedule This section defines what metric needs to be collected, how frequently it should  be collected, and how frequently it should be persisted. The IntervalSchedule  element defines the collection frequency. The UPLOAD attribute defines the sample  ratio of the collection that should be persisted, 1 indicates that each sample should  be persisted, 2 indicates that every second collection should be persisted with and so  forth. In the following example, we are collecting VirtualServerStats metric every  1-minute and we persist with every collection of metrics.

For example, the following code snippet shows that for metric column  NewRequests, we should use "Greater than"—  we should use "Greater than"—GT—the mathematical operator for  evaluating the metric threshold.  This section can also be used to define some out-of-the-box metric thresholds; it  also contains the alert message that is sent out as a notification whenever a metric  threshold is violated.   <Condition COLUMN_NAME="NewRequests" CRITICAL="NotDefined"  WARNING="NotDefined" OPERATOR="GT" MESSAGE_NLSID="New_Reqs"  MESSAGE="New Requests are %value%" >  Packaging and deploying a plug-in So far we have seen how to monitor a target using various definition files. In this   section, we'll see how we can package those files into an archive. This archive   can be used to deploy the monitoring support on multiple hosts through   Enterprise Manager Console.  Packaging  We'll use emcli command utility to package all the files required for the  management plug-in. One sample command is listed next—for more details   on emcli command and all other options, you can refer to the Enterprise   Manager documentation.  emcli add_mp_to_mpa -mpa=" tmp sun_javawebserver.jar"  -mp_version="1.0"  -ttd=" tmp metadata sun_javawebserver.xml"  -dc=" tmp default_collection sun_javawebserver.xml"       -file="MONITORING_SCRIPT: tmp sunws.pl"  -func_desc="Management Plug-in version 1.0 for SUN Java Webserver"  Please note that  tmp is a temporary location where we can copy the files   downloaded from the Packt website .

Advance features for plug-ins So far, we have learned about the basic functionality of plug-ins, we saw the various  artefacts needed and we also saw how to package and deploy those artefacts.   In this section, we'll cover some of the advanced features of plug-ins.   Charts Once the plug-in is deployed and the target is discovered, we can see the target  homepage, and on the homepage, we can see the status and availability metrics.   [ 280 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Wouldn't it be nice if we could add some charts that can show historical data on  the target homepage? Plug-ins provide support for adding such charts on the target  homepage. All that we need to do is that we define the location of the chart, the data  that should go in the chart and the type of the chart. We can define all of this in an  XML format and include that file as part of the plug-in archive.  One sample chart file is listed below:   Chapter 13                                                                    VirtualServerStats           NewRequests            300           150           south           true           Virtual Server                                               Traffic                      <ChartProperty                       NAME="destination">metricDetail           Number of                                                Requets                       This chart definition can also be included in the Management Plug-in Archive.

We will be providing  the best practices categorized by such responsibilities. These best practices cover  all aspects of systems monitoring and management, and will help you in building  comprehensive approach for systems monitoring and management.  Enterprise Manager provides special support to implement these guidelines for  most of the middleware targets, such as one click system creation, out-of-the-box  configuration policies and so on. In case some customization is needed, or specialized  support is not there, Enterprise Manager provides UI flows to customize or implement  a best practice.  In this chapter, we'll provide some best practices for monitoring and managing  middleware targets using the Enterprise Manager Grid Control. Some of the best  practices were covered in the previous chapters—those practices were more specific  to a particular middleware target, for example using deployment procedure to  deploy a BPEL suitcase. We will bring together all such best practices for specific  targets and generalize those best practices to cover all middleware targets. It   will help you in putting together a plan for the management and monitoring of  middleware targets.

Provisioning of an application comprises multiple provisioning operations.   These operations include:   Provisioning of core stack i.e. J2EE server, HTTP server, Identity servers, and  so on  Provisioning of application artefacts i.e. J2EE applications, BPEL processes,  OSB services, and so on  Some of the best practices for provisioning are discussed in the sections ahead.  Creating gold images  After the first installation is completed, various required patches are applied,  configuration is done, and the system is stabilized; you should create a gold image  of the setup and use it for subsequent setups. This image will also help to rebuild a  system from scratch just in case the server crashes.   Enterprise Manager provides support for the gold image creation for Oracle   products like Oracle Application Server. For other products you can write your   own scripts and use them for the gold image creation.  Use software library as central repository Besides the gold image of core stack, keep all your application artefacts in the  software library. The software library is a central repository where you can   keep all of the gold images and artefacts; it is very well integrated with the   deployment framework.  [ 286 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   The software library also provides support for assigning maturity levels to each  component. For example, you can put a new J2EE application in the software library  and mark it as untested, after testing the QA Manager can mark it beta, after the   end-user acceptance, it can be marked as production. The page shown in the  following screenshot shows a view of the software library—where you can see  Sample BPEL Suitcase is production ready, where as SOA Order Booking   is untested.  Chapter 14  Define deployment procedures for all  provisioning activities Implement the deployment policies as deployment procedures. For example, if  you want HTTP traffic to be stopped before deploying a new application and want  to send an email after deployment, you should put these steps in a deployment  procedure and deploy applications using this deployment procedure. This will help  you in standardizing the deployment practices and for every deployment you can  check logs from the central console.

For the other artefacts, you can either customize the   existing deployments procedure, or build a new one.   Routine monitoring  Most of the applications today are built with multi-tier architecture, where multiple  middleware components are deployed in different tiers. Within each tier, there  can be software components distributed on multiple servers. To monitor such  applications, you need to monitor all of the components in the different tiers. For   example, a typical web-based application serves content through HTTP server, has  presentation tier deployed in J2EE container, has business tier deployed in the J2EE  container, has authentication data stored in LDAP server, and has persistence in the  relational database.   In such a distributed environment, often one or more components can become  bottlenecks and can affect the performance of complete application. As a middleware  administrator, you need to identify components that are bottlenecks, or can become  potential bottlenecks, so that you can take some actions, such as adding more  capacity for that component. For example, in a web-based application the HTTP  server can be a bottleneck, and you can improve performance of the application by  adding more capacity for the HTTP server.  Some of the best practices for monitoring middleware components and applications  are listed in the following sections.  Select monitoring indicators and define  acceptable limits Each software component provides lots of performance metrics, but not all of the  metrics are useful for each deployment of the component. Vendors provide such  metric support so that any possible deployment can be monitored, but you need  to monitor metrics that are useful for you. For example, there are two applications  deployed, application A provides implementation for many web services and  application B provides implementation for Enterprise Java Beans  EJBs . In this   case, you should focus on web service metrics for application A and EJB metrics   for application B.   Usually, the application developers know about the content of application, but it's  very important that administrators also have some details so that they can focus on  appropriate metrics.

For many  metrics, thresholds are available out-of-the-box, but for some metrics you need  to define the thresholds. For example, the acceptable response time for air traffic  control application could be in milliseconds whilst the acceptable response time for  shopping catalog can be a few seconds.  So, based on the nature of your application, you define the thresholds that indicate  acceptable limits for your component. Any such violation of the thresholds is  recorded and can be later used for further analysis like capacity planning, and so on.  You can also use violation history to tweak your thresholds. From the Enterprise Manager Console, you can use Metric and Policy Setting from  any target homepage to view or update the thresholds for the metrics. The following  screenshot shows one such page for HTTP server. You can set the warning and  critical thresholds for each metric. The following screenshot depicts that the warning  threshold for error rate is set at 1% and critical threshold is set at 1.5%:  [ 289 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Best Practices for Managing Middleware Components Using Enterprise Manager  Use monitoring templates Setting thresholds for multiple targets can be a time-consuming activity. Monitoring  templates can be used to define a threshold definition. The monitoring template can  be applied to multiple targets of the same type. You can also set a default-monitoring  template for a target type. The default template for a target type gets applied to any  new target of matching target type. The following screenshot shows a page where  you can create, modify, or apply a template to one or more targets:  Setup notification rules Some events are critical and for such events you need notifications to be sent out to  an administrator or system, the rest of the events are still recorded in the repository.  You should identify the events that are critical for you and set up appropriate  notification rules. Criticality of such events can depend on nature or use of  application. For example, if the public website is down, you may want notifications  to be sent out, but if the intranet site is down you don't need notifications to be sent  out, to achieve this you need to setup notification rules accordingly.  [ 290 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 14  Besides paging or informing the system administrator, these notification rules can be  used to communicate the availability of one system to another system. For example,  if some application is down you can send out an SNMP trap to another application  informing about the non-availability of the former application.  Enterprise Manager provides support for defining notification rules, where you can  define rules for all targets of the same type or some individual targets. You can also  select the events for which you want notifications.   The following screenshot displays a page where you can create, edit, or delete  notification rules:   [ 291 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Best Practices for Managing Middleware Components Using Enterprise Manager  Select one of the notification rules and click on the Edit option, and you will see a  page as shown next. From this page, you can select the metrics for which you want to  receive notifications. You can also select the policies and jobs for which you want to  receive the notifications.  Manage many-as-one To monitor an application you need to monitor all the related components. You need  to have a view where you can see performance of all related components together  and should be able to drill down to the performance of individual components. This  view also helps in identifying the bottlenecks of a system.  Use the system construct provided by Enterprise Manager for grouping such related  components. For many applications like BPEL Process Manager, Enterprise Manager  provides a short cut to create a system where the Enterprise Manager identifies all  the related components and groups them. For any other application, you can create  such a system manually, by identifying and adding all components.  [ 292 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Chapter 14  Defining Service Level Agreements  SLA  Model the services provided by an application using the service construct of EM.  You can define the service level agreements for availability and performance of   this service. You can use the system metrics and the test metrics for defining   these agreements.   Enterprise Manager provides a shortcut to create a service for many applications, for  example, the BPEL process manager. However, for the rest you can create services   by using the generic services framework.  Define service tests To monitor actual user behavior, define service tests that repeat the recorded  transaction at fixed intervals. For example, in a shopping cart application you can  record a web transaction that goes through each step of shopping cart, and you can  repeat all the steps of transaction from different geographical locations. Enterprise  Manager provides various test types: some can simulate user behavior like the web  transaction test, others can be used to monitor a component like the Host ping test.  Have a beacon in each geographical region where your user community resides. By  executing recorded transactions from beacons in different regions, you can identify  the issues local to a given community; for example, if network traffic is slower in  Europe and fine in North America, then the beacon test from Europe will show you  significant delays compared to North America. Just looking at the beacon results   you can find that network latency issues in Europe are causing a slowdown for   users in Europe.  Configuration management We learned in previous chapters that Enterprise Manager collects configuration  data for monitored targets. Enterprise Manager also keeps a history of configuration  changes for the monitored targets. Collected configuration data can also be used to  ensure configuration compliance across multiple targets.  Some best practices for configuration management are discussed in the next sections.

Such snapshots will be very useful in keeping track   of all the configuration operations performed by you. Ideally, save a snapshot   after initial installation and one snapshot after every configuration, patching, or   upgrade operation.  For some applications you may need to make configuration changes on multiple  components—in such cases, save a configuration snapshot for all of the components  and use the description field to relate all such snapshots. These snapshots can be very  useful in case you want to view and restore configuration changes across components.  You can also use these snapshots to search for a particular configuration item, for  example, you can search for all Web Logic Servers that are running on port 7001. The  following screenshot explains one such search page:  Enterprise Manager provides support for exporting importing snapshots to from  the file system. You can use this for saving configuration screenshots outside  Enterprise Manager.

This feature is very handy when an application works  in an environment but doesn't work in another environment.   You can also use configuration comparison to compare the configuration of the same  component at two points in time.  Configuration compliance Use configuration policies to enforce configuration compliance in your data center.  Enterprise Manager provides many useful out-of-the-box policies. You can use   those policies or define new policies for configuration compliance. For example, in  Chapter 4, we saw how to define a configuration policy that checks for any Web  Logic Server running on a default port  7001 .  You can use the compliance score generated by Enterprise Manager to quantitatively  define configuration compliance for a target. The following screenshot shows a  configuration compliance score for a host target:    [ 295 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Best Practices for Managing Middleware Components Using Enterprise Manager  Lifecycle management  There are many routine operations that a middleware administrator needs to take  care of. Most of these operations are repetitive in nature  for example, weekly backup  of a system . Besides such operations, administrator needs to keep track of any  critical patch advisories and needs to apply critical patches.  Some best practices for routine operations are discussed in the next sections.  Using the Critical Patch advisory  Typically, there are patching advisories published every month, these advisories  contain all of the recommended patches for all of the products. Manually finding  out which patch recommendations are appropriate can be a tedious task and can be  prone to error. Also periodically, you will need to check for any new patch advisory.   Configure Grid Control for automatic download of patch advisories. Once these  advisories are downloaded, Grid Control will evaluate and suggest only the patches  applicable for your environment. You may want to revisit Chapter 8, SOA Management—OSB  aka ALSB  Management,  on how to configure Grid Control for automatic download of the patch advisory.  Using deployment procedures for patching In big data centers, patching multiple servers can be a very time consuming job.  Besides the effort in patching, you need to keep track of the servers patched and the  servers to be patched.  You can manage such a scenario very easily by using deployment procedures for  patching. By using deployment procedures, you can deploy patches on one or more  components with the effort required for a patching operation on one component. You may want to revisit Chapter 8, SOA Management—OSB  aka ALSB  Management,  on how to use deployment procedures for patching   Use the job system library Most of the Administrators have some scripts for the routine operation, which they  execute manually or schedule through some other mechanisms like crontab. Such a  methodology has been in practice for a long time but has some disadvantages, for  example, there is no central repository of such scripts or there is no central place  where you can see the output of all scheduled operations.

Later, you can pick out a job from the  job system library scheduled execution of job definition.  Also this could be very useful where an administrator can define and save a few jobs  in the job library, and based on the system requirement, the operator can execute  one or more jobs. With this approach, the operator doesn't need to know all the  complexity and parameters of jobs.  The following screenshot shows such a page where you can create or submit jobs  from the job library:  Using the multi-tasking jobs Multi-task jobs are used to define complex jobs by combining existing job types. For  example, consider a scenario where you need to do a cold backup every day and  along with the backup you need to rotate the log files. For this scenario, you can  define a multi-task job that consists of shutdown job, backup job, and rotatelogs job.  You can schedule this multi-task job to achieve all required operations.  With this approach, you can define modular jobs for simple operations and can  combine some or all of them to achieve complex tasks.

You can leverage information-publishing  support from Enterprise Manager to make this task easier.  Some best practices for information publishing are discussed in the next sections.  Using reports for information publishing There are many out-of-the-box reports that you can use. You can customize or build  new reports using wizards provided by the Enterprise Manager Framework. You   can use various report content elements and formatting elements to build or  customize reports.  Once you have the reports definition that you want, you can define the frequency of  report generation. Enterprise Manager schedules the report generation and saves the  generated report in the repository. Enterprise Manager can also email those reports  as and when generated.   Use database views for publishing  information There are various public database views available in the Enterprise Manager  Repository. You can use these views for publishing information from a repository.  For example you can use some business intelligence tools to generate reports from  public views in a repository.  The benefit of using public views is that across the different releases, view definitions  are maintained.

We saw how to use those features to manage specific middleware entities.  In this chapter, we bring together our learning from different chapters and put across  the best practices for middleware monitoring and management.   The key takeaways in terms of best practices from this chapter are:                             Create a gold image of your setup—you can use the gold image for cloning  or building a new setup Use the software library to store all gold images and application artefacts Implement your deployment processes through deployment procedures For monitoring, select the metrics you want to monitor and define acceptable  limits for those metrics Define the notification rules for critical metrics To monitor an application, monitor all of the entities that contribute in  making the application operational Define service to represent services provided by an application Save configuration snapshots after all configuration patching   upgrade operations. Enforce configuration compliance through configuration policies Use the jobs library and multi-tasking jobs for routine operations Use reports and public view to publish operational compliance information  about data centers  [ 299 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Alison Voyvodich on 4th December 2009 12593 80th Avenue N, , Seminole, , 33776  Download at WoweBook.Com   Symbols 10gR5 Agent installing  35 A Access Manager  about  196 discovery  196  Access Server  about  197 discovery  197  AD4J  about  245, 253 application hangs, diagnosing  257 architecture  253 cross-tier diagnostics  260 features  256 installing  254 Java applications, diagnosing  256 memory leaks, analyzing  261 memory leaks, detecting  261 thread, tracing  259  AD4J architecture  253 AD4J Console  starting  254, 255  AD4J installation  254 Administration Server  60 advanced features, plug-ins  charts  280, 281  agent  starting  38 stopping  38  agent targets  23  Index  Apache HTTP Server  about  228 discovering  228 managing  228-230  Apache Tomcat  about  230 managing  230 plug-in, downloading  230  Application Diagnostics for Java.
