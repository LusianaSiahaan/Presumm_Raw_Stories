With the JavaScript Cookbook, I had to choose among hundreds of uses to determine what to include. After all these years of watching JavaScript grow, I am still surprised at how far-reaching the use of JavaScript has become. In my opinion, there is no more useful programming language or development tool. About the only technology with wider use is HTML. This  book  is  for  those  who  have  dabbled  with  JavaScript  and  wish  to  try  out  new techniques,  or  increase  their  grasp  of  both  fundamentals  and  advanced  features  of JavaScript. Along the way, I’ll demonstrate how to:    Work with the JavaScript objects, such as String, Array, Number, and Math   Create reusable objects   Query and create new elements in the Document Object Model  DOM    Use the new Selectors API for efficient and targeted querying   Use JavaScript with new HTML5 technologies, such as the new media elements,  video and audio    Create interactive applications   Manage your web page space   Store data in various ways, from the simple to the complex   Use JavaScript with Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  and the canvas element   Work with some of the interesting data structures, like Microformats and RDFa   Package  your  library  for  others  to  use,  as  well  as  use  other  libraries  in  your  applications    Ensure your JavaScript applications are accessible through the use of Accessible  Rich Internet Applications  ARIA     Work in environments other than the typical desktop browser, such as creating  mobile phone web applications, or extending Photoshop with new behaviors    Use and create jQuery plug-ins   Develop Ajax applications  xiii     Debug your applications using your browser’s debugger   Work with the new HTML5 drag-and-drop   Communicate using the new HTML5 cross-documentation techniques   Implement concurrent programming with Web Workers   Use the File API to access a desktop file directly in client-side JavaScript  It’s not a complete encyclopedia of JavaScript use today—no one book can cover all there is to cover. But hopefully, you’ll come away with an appreciation of all you can do with JavaScript. Bon appetit!  Audience, Assumptions, and Approach Readers of this book should have some exposure to web development, and the use of JavaScript. In addition, the recipe format means I’ll be focusing on specific tasks, rather than providing an overall general introduction. I won’t cover every last aspect of a JavaScript  topic,  such  as  Strings.  Instead,  I’ll  focus  on  the  more  common  tasks,  or challenges, associated with the topic. There will be lots of code, some of it in code snippets, some in full-page applications. The recipes are also cross-referenced, so if I mention a specific topic in one recipe that was covered in another, I’ll include this information in the “See Also” section for the recipe. To assist you, I’ve also created example code for all of the recipes that you can download and work with immediately. Target Browsers Throughout the book, I’ll mention the target browsers. The majority of example code in this book has been designed for, and tested to work with, the latest releases of the most commonly used browsers:    Firefox 3.6x on Mac and Windows   Safari 4.0x on Mac and Windows   Opera 10.x on Mac and Windows   Chrome 5.x on Windows   Internet Explorer 8 on Windows  I didn’t have a Linux machine to test for that environment, but, knock on wood, most of the recipes should work in a Linux environment with Firefox. I also didn’t have a System 7 for testing the IE9 preview, but most of the applications should work, in- cluding those using SVG  a new addition for IE9 . Some of the recipes required a specialized environment, such as a mobile device or emulator, or beta  or alpha  release of the browser. I made a note where an example  xiv  Preface   would not work with the target browsers, or required a specialized environment or browser. In addition, I’m introducing several new technologies and APIs that are only implemented in alpha beta releases of certain of the browsers. Again, I included a note about browser support. Many of the examples won’t work with IE6. Before I even began the book I decided not to provide support for IE6—including any workaround code. Many major sites no longer support this far too old and too insecure browser, including Amazon, Google, YouTube, and Facebook. In addition, the workarounds necessary for IE6 are so well- known and so well-documented online, that I felt it wasn’t necessary to also include coverage in this book. Most of the examples that work with IE8 will work with IE7, with some exceptions. IE7  doesn’t  support  getAttribute setAttribute  on  the  common  attributes,  such  as style, id, and class, and doesn’t support hasAttribute at all. In addition, IE7 doesn’t support  either  the  CSS  selectors,  or  the  Selectors  API  methods,  such  as  docu ment.querySelectorAll  covered in Chapter 11 . Where IE7 doesn’t work, either I provide IE7-specific workarounds in comments in the example code you can download, or I make a note about nonsupport in the recipe— or both. Sample Code Conventions There are many code snippets and full-page examples all throughout the book. Most are based in HTML, but there are some that are based in XHTML, the XML serialization of HTML. In addition, most of the examples are based in HTML5, though I’ve also used a couple of other HTML versions, especially with the SVG examples: HTML5     XHTML5  XHTML+SVG       <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC     "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1  EN"     "http:  www.w3.org 2002 04 xhtml-math-svg xhtml-math-svg.dtd">  There’s only a couple of differences in the samples based on the HTML version. If the example is X HTML5, you don’t need a type attribute for either the style or script elements. Additionally, in many of the XHTML sample pages, I surround the code with a CDATA section, like the following:      <![CDATA[  Preface  xv   ...    -->     The reason for using a CDATA section for the script block in XHTML is that characters such as the angle bracket     and ampersand  &  are meaningful in JavaScript, but they’re also meaningful as markup. When an XML parser sees the characters, it wants to interpret them as markup. To prevent this, the CDATA section tells the parser to ignore the section. I tried to keep all of the style settings and script in the same page to simplify the ex- amples. However, in the real world, you’ll want to separate your stylesheet and script into separate files, as much as possible. Doing so keeps your HTML files clean, and makes it easy to change both style and script. Approach In the book, I cover basic JavaScript functionality that’s been around since the dawn of time, and is still essential for application development. I also include recipes covering some of the newer functionality, including working with the canvas element, trying out the new cross-domain widget communication technique  postMessage , working with the new File API and Web Workers, integrating your code with the popular jQuery library—even working with the new HTML video and audio elements  which was a lot of fun . I also introduce some of the newer uses of JavaScript, such as in mobile devices and offline desktop applications, as well as the different forms of data storage, and accessing metadata such as Microformats and RDFa in the web page. Organization The book is a relatively esoteric blend of topics, primarily covering those areas where I’ve seen both interest and growth in the last few years. I also include an introduction to the new ECMAScript 5 and HTML5 innovations. However, this book does consist of two rather general sections: the first focuses on existing JavaScript functionality and objects; the second focuses more on JavaScript used within environments, such as a browser. If you’re relatively new to JavaScript, I recommend working through all of the recipes in the first 10 chapters before tackling the recipes later in the book. Following is a chapter breakdown of the book:  Chapter 1, Working with JavaScript Strings  Covers some of the more commonly occurring String tasks, such as concatenating strings, trimming white space, breaking strings into tokens, as well as finding sub- strings within strings.  xvi   Preface   Chapter 2, Using Regular Expressions  Demonstrates the use of regular expressions, as well as working with the JavaScript RegExp object. Recipes include basic how-tos such as swapping words, replacing HTML tags with named entities, validating a Social Security number  and other patterned objects , and globally replacing values.  Chapter 3, Dates, Time, and Timers  Describes how to access dates and times, as well as how to format date strings, track elapsed time, find a future date, and using both the new and old ISO 8601 JavaScript functionality. The chapter also introduces JavaScript timers and work- ing with timers and function closures.  Chapter 4, Working with Numbers and Math  Includes basic number functionality, such as keeping an incremental counter and including  conversions  between  hexadecimals  and  decimals,  generating  random colors, converting strings in tables to numbers, as well as converting between ra- dian and degrees  important when working with canvas or SVG .  Chapter 5, Working with Arrays and Loops  Arrays are the thing in this chapter, which provides a look at how to use arrays to create FIFO queues and LIFO stacks, as well as how to sort an array, work with multidimensional arrays, traverse arrays, use the new ECMAScript 5 array func- tionality to create filtered arrays, and validate array contents. The chapter also covers associative arrays, as well as various ways to traverse arrays.  Chapter 6, Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions  The JavaScript Function is the heart and soul of this language, and this chapter focuses on how to create functions, pass values to and from the function, create a recursive function, as well as build a dynamic function. The chapter also includes how to use Memoization and Currying, to enhance application efficiency and per- formance, as well as how to use an anonymous function in order to wrap global variables.  Chapter 7, Handling Events  Covers basic event handling tasks, including capturing events, canceling events, accessing  the  Event  object,  as  well  as  working  with  both  mouse  and  keyboard events. The chapter also covers the new HTML5 drag-and-drop functionality, as well as working with Safari’s Orientation Events  for mobile development .  Chapter 8, Browser Pieces  This chapter gets into the basic working components all browsers, and many other user agents, share. This includes creating new windows, changing a stylesheet, modifying an image, adding a bread crumb to a web page, bookmarking a dynamic page, as well as preserving the back button in Ajax applications. The chapter also introduces the new HTML5 History functionality for preserving dynamic state.  Chapter 9, Form Elements and Validation  This chapter continues the introduction of regular expressions from Chapter 2, but focuses on form elements and validation. The chapter also covers how to enable  Preface  xvii   and  disable  form  elements  and  hide  or  display  elements,  and  includes  how  to modify a selection list, and canceling a form submission.  Chapter 10, Debugging and Error Handling  None of us like it, all of us need it: this chapter focuses on error handling in ap- plications, as well as how to use the different debugging tools in the book’s target browsers.  Chapter 11, Accessing Page Elements  This  chapter  covers  the  various  ways  you  can  access  one  or  more  document elements. Included are discussions on accessing all elements of a certain type, a specific element, or using the newer Selectors API to use CSS-like syntax to find elements. Also included is a discussion of namespace specifics, where appropriate.  Chapter 12, Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes  The chapter includes ways to create and add elements to a web document, includ- ing adding text, paragraphs, working with table elements, and moving and remov- ing document elements. The chapter also covers how to add and access element attributes, and includes coverage of namespace specifics, where appropriate.  Chapter 13, Working with Web Page Spaces  The web page is a canvas on which we create, and this chapter covers how to determine the area of the web page, the size of page elements, their location, as well as how to hide and show page sections. Popular behaviors such as expandos  accordions and page overlays, as well as tabbed pages are included, as is how to create a collapsible sidebar and a hover-based pop-up message.  Chapter 14, Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA For the longest time, our dynamic web page effects were literally silent to a signif- icant web community—those using screen readers. This chapter introduces the new  Web  Accessibility  Initiative–Accessible  Rich  Internet  Applications   WAI- ARIA  attributes and roles and demonstrates how they can make a web page come alive for all readers, not just those who are sighted. The chapter also covers other very common interactive effects, including providing a flash of color to signal an event, working with pop-up messages, creating Live Regions, and providing ac- cessible effects when validating forms.  Chapter 15, Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications  I am not the most artistic of souls, but I do know how to make JavaScript work with the canvas element and SVG. In this chapter, I provide the basic steps needed in order to work with both of these media, as well as the newer WebGL 3D envi- ronment, and the new HTML5 video and audio elements.  Chapter 16, JavaScript Objects  Probably one of the most important chapters in the book, this chapter covers the basics of creating JavaScript objects, including how to keep data members private, adding Getters Setters, using the new ECMAScript 5 object protection function- ality, chaining object methods, and using the new Prototype.bind.  xviii   Preface   Chapter 17, JavaScript Libraries  All of the book focuses on creating your own JavaScript objects and applications. This chapter introduces us to jQuery, one of the more popular JavaScript frame- work libraries. It covers common library tasks such as how to package your code into libraries, how to test the libraries, and how to build a jQuery plug-in, as well as how to use your library with other libraries, such as jQuery.  Chapter 18, Communication  Most  of  the  chapter  is  focused  on  Ajax  tasks,  including  preparing  the  data  for sending, creating an XMLHttpRequest object, checking for errors, and processing the results. Also included are how to use a timer for a continuously updated query, how to create a dynamic image pop-up, and how to use JSON-P for cross-domain requests. The chapter introduces the postMessage functionality, for communicating between a remotely hosted widget and your own application.  Chapter 19, Working with Structured Data  Tasks covered include how to process an XML document returned from an Ajax call, using the new JSON object to parse JSON or stringify a JavaScript object. The chapter also includes how to work with Microformats or RDFa in the page.  Chapter 20, Persistence  This chapter covers how to create and use an HTTP cookie, of course, and how to store data using the page URL, but also provides recipes for working with the new sessionStorage and localStorage persistence techniques introduced with HTML5, and an introduction to client-side SQL databases.  Chapter 21, JavaScript Outside the Box  This chapter briefly gets into all the various ways that JavaScript can be used now, none of which have anything to do with traditional web page development. Inclu- ded are discussions on creating mobile and desktop widgets, mobile device appli- cation development, creating add-ons and extensions for browsers, as well as how JavaScript  can  be  used  with  so  many  of  our  applications,  such  as  OpenOffice  which I used to write this book  and Photoshop. I also include a discussion of desktop application development, including support for offline applications, and featuring examples of both the Web Workers API, and the File API.

Though you may get numeric values from web page forms, the values are retrieved as strings, which you then have to convert into numeric values. Strings are also used as parameters when invoking server-side application calls through Ajax, as well as forming the basic serialization format of every JavaScript object. One of  the  methods  that  all  JavaScript  objects  share  is  toString,  which  returns  a  string containing the serialized format of the object. A String Primitive A JavaScript string can be both a primitive data type or an object. As a primitive type, it joins with four other JavaScript primitive types: number, Boolean  true or false , null  no value , and undefined  unknown . In addition, as a primitive data type, strings are also JavaScript literals: a collection that includes numbers  as either floating point or integer , the literal format for arrays, objects, and regular expressions, as well as numbers and Booleans.  We’ll see more about the literal formats for the various JavaScript ob- jects throughout the book.  A string is zero or more characters delimited by quotes, either single quotes:  'This is a string'  Or double quotes:  "This is a string"  1   There is no rule for which type of quote to use. If you’re including single quotes within the text, you’ll most likely want to use double quotes:  "This isn't a number."  If  you  mix  up  the  quote  types—begin  a  string  with  a  single  quote  and  end  with  a double—you’ll receive an application error:  var badString = 'This is a bad string";    oops, error  Both quote types are used interchangeably in the book. A String Object A  string  object  is  called  String,  appropriately  enough,  and  like  all  other  JavaScript objects has a set of properties that come prebuilt into the object type. A String object can be instantiated using the JavaScript new operator, to create a new object instance:  var city = new String "St. Louis" ;  Once instantiated, any one of the available string properties can be accessed on it, such as in the following code, where the string is lowercased using the String object method toLowerCase:  var lcCity = city.toLowerCase  ;     new string is now st. louis  If you access the String constructor without using new, you’ll create a string literal rather than a String object:  var city = String "St. Louis" ;  If you do need to access a  String object method on a string literal, you can. What happens is the JavaScript engine creates a String object, wraps it around the string literal, performs the method call, and then discards the String object. When to use String, as compared to using a string literal, depends on the circumstan- ces. Unless you plan on using the String object properties, you’ll want to use string literals wherever possible. However, if you’ll be using String methods, then create the string as an object. See Also Mozilla has a terrific page that discusses the concept of JavaScript literals and the dif- ferent  types.  You  can  access  the  page  at  https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core_Java Script_1.5_Guide Literals.  2  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   1.1  Concatenating Two or More Strings Problem You want to merge two or more strings into one. Solution Concatenate the strings using the addition  +  operator:  var string1 = "This is a "; var string2 = "test";  var string3 = string1 + string2;    creates a new string with "This is a test"  Discussion The addition operator  +  is typically used to add numbers together:  var newValue = 1 + 3;    result is 4  In JavaScript, though, the addition operator is overloaded, which means it can be used for multiple data types, including strings. When used with strings, the results are con- catenated, with the strings later in the equation appended to the end of the string result. You can add two strings:  var string3 = string1 + string2;  or you can add multiple strings:  var string1 = "This"; var string2 = "is"; var string3 = "a"; var string4 = "test"; var stringResult = string1 + " " + string2 + " " +                       string3 + " " + string4;    result is "This is a test"  There is a shortcut to concatenating strings, and that’s the JavaScript shorthand as- signment operator  += . The following code snippet, which uses this operator:  var oldValue = "apples"; oldValue += " and oranges";    string now has "apples and oranges"  is equivalent to:  var oldValue = "apples"; oldValue = oldValue + " and oranges";  The shorthand assignment operator works with strings by concatenating the string on the right side of the operator to the end of the string on the left.  1.1  Concatenating Two or More Strings   3   There is a built-in String method that can concatenate multiple strings: concat. It takes one or more string parameters, each of which are appended to the end of the string object:  var nwStrng = "".concat "This ","is ","a ","string" ;    returns "This is a string"  The concat method can be a simpler way to generate a string from multiple values, such as generating a string from several form fields. However, the use of the addition operator is the more commonly used approach.  1.2  Concatenating a String and Another Data Type Problem You want to concatenate a string with another data type, such as a number. Solution Use the exact same operators, such as addition  +  and shorthand assignment  += , you use when concatenating strings:  var numValue = 23.45; var total = "And the total is " + numValue;    string has "And the total is 23.45"  Discussion A different process occurs when adding a string and another data type. In the case of another data type, such as a Boolean or number, the JavaScript engine first converts the other data type’s value into a string, and then performs concatenation:     add a boolean to a string var boolValue = true; var strngValue = "The value is " + boolValue;    results in "The value is true"     add a number to a string var numValue = 3.0; strngValue = "The value is " + numValue;    results in "The value is 3"  The automatic data conversion also applies if you’re concatenating a String object with a string literal, which is a necessary capability if you’re not sure whether the strings you’re working with are objects or literals but you still want to create a concatenated string:  var strObject = new String "The value is " ; var strngLiteral = "a string"; var strngValue = strObject + strngLiteral;    results in "The value is a string"  The resulting string is a string literal, not a String object.  4  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   1.3  Conditionally Comparing Strings Problem You want to compare two strings to see if they’re the same. Solution Use the equality operator  ==  within a conditional test:  var strName = prompt "What's your name?", "" ;  if  strName == "Shelley"  {    alert "Your name is Shelley! Good for you!" ; } else {    alert "Your name isn't Shelley. Bummer." ; }  Discussion Two strings can be compared using the equality operator  == . When used within a conditional statement, a block of code is run if the test evaluates to true  the strings are equal :  if  strName == "Shelley"  {    alert "Your name is Shelley! Good for you!" ; }  If the strings are not equal, the first statement following the conditional statement block is processed. If an if...else conditional statement is used, the block of code following the else keyword is the one that’s processed:  if  strName == "Shelley"  {    alert "Your name is Shelley! Good for you!" ; } else {    alert "Your name isn't Shelley. Bummer." ; }  There are factors that can influence the success of the string comparison. For instance, strings have case, and can consist of uppercase characters, lowercase characters, or a combination of both. Unless case is an issue, you’ll most likely want to convert the string to all lowercase or uppercase, using the built-in String methods toLowerCase and toUpperCase, before making the comparison, as shown in the following code:  var strName = prompt "What's your name?", "" ;  if  strName.toUpperCase    == "SHELLEY"  {    alert "Your name is Shelley! Good for you!" ; } else {    alert "Your name isn't Shelley. Bummer." ; }  Note that the toUpperCase method  and toLowerCase  do not take any parameters.  1.3  Conditionally Comparing Strings   5   In Recipe 1.2, I discussed that data type conversion occurs automatically when con- catenating a numeric or Boolean value, or a String object to a string. This same type of data type conversion also occurs with the equality operator if one value is a string. In the following, the number 10.00 is converted into the string “10”, and then used in the comparison:  var numVal = 10.00; if  numVal == "10"  alert  "The value is ten" ; succeeds  There  may  be  times,  though,  when  you  don’t  want  automatic  data  conversion  to occur—when you want the comparison to fail if the values are of different data types. For instance, if one value is a string literal and the other is a String object, you might want the comparison to fail because the two variables are of different data types, re- gardless of their perspective values. In this case, you’ll want to use a different equality operator, the strict equality operator  === : var  strObject = new  String "Shelley" ;  var  strLiteral  =  "Shelley";  if  strObject  ==  strLiteral     this comparison succeeds  ...  if  strObject === strLiteral     fails because of different data types  The comparison fails if the two variables being compared are different data types, even though their primitive string values are the same. Sometimes, you might want to specifically test that two strings are not alike, rather than whether they are alike. The operators to use then are the inequality operator  !=  and  strict inequality operator  !== . They work in the same manner as the previous two operators just discussed, but return true when the strings are not alike:  var strnOne  =  "one"; var strnTwo  =  "two"; if  strnOne != strnTwo     true, as they are not the same string value  The strict inequality operator returns true if the strings are not the same value or the data type of the two operands  values on either side of the operator  is different:  var strObject = new String "Shelley" ; var strLiteral = "Shelley"; if  strObject !== strLiteral     succeeds, because data type of operands differs  If you’re more interested in discovering how two strings may differ, you can use other  comparison operators, as shown in Table 1-1.  6  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   Table 1-1. Comparison operators  Operator Equality ==  Description True if operands are the same; otherwise false  Strict equality ===  True if operands are the same, and the same data type; otherwise false  Inequality !=  True if operands are not the same; otherwise false  Strict inequality !==  True if operands are not the same, or are not the same data type; otherwise false  Greater than >  True if first operand is greater in value than second operand  Greater than or equal >=  True if first operand is greater than or equal to second operand  Less than <  True if second operand is greater than first operand  Less than or equal <=  True if second operand is greater than or equal to first operand  Example var sVal = "this"; if  sVal == "this     true var sVal = "this"; var sVal2 = new String "this" ;  if  sVal === sVal2     not true var sVal = "this"; if  sVal == "that"     true var sVal = "this"; var sVal2 = new String "this" ;  if  sVal !== sVal2     true var sOne = "cat"; var sTwo = "dog";  if  sOne > sTwo     false var sOne = "Cat"; var sTwo = "cat";  if  sOne >= sTwo     true var sOne = "cat"; var sTwo = "Cat";  if  sOne < sTwo     true var sOne = new String "cat" ; var sTwo = "cat";  if  sOne <= sTwo     equal, true  Comparison operators work numerically with numbers, but lexically with strings. For instance, the value “dog” would be lexically greater than “cat”, because the letter “d” in “dog” occurs later in the alphabet than the letter “c” in “cat”:  var sOne = "cat"; var sTwo = "dog" if  sOne > sTwo    false, because "cat" is lexically less than "dog"  If two string literals only vary based on case, the uppercase characters are lexically greater than the lowercase letter:  var sOne  = "Cat"; var sTwo  = "cat"; if  sOne >=  sTwo     true, because 'C' is lexically greater than 'c'  There is no strict greater than or strict less than operators, so it makes no difference if the data type of the operands differs:  var sOne = new String "cat" ; var sTwo = "cat"; if  sOne <= sTwo     both equal, so true, as data type doesn't matter  1.3  Conditionally Comparing Strings   7   Before leaving this recipe, there is another approach you can use to compare strings, but this one has a little kick to it. It’s based on the String method, localeCompare. The localeCompare method takes one parameter, a string, which is compared against the string value to which it is attached. The method returns a numeric value equal to 0 if the two strings are the same; –1 if the string parameter is lexically greater than the original string; 1 otherwise:  var fruit1 = "apple"; var fruit2 = "grape"; var i = fruit1.localeCompare fruit2 ;    returns -1  For  the  most  part,  you’ll  probably  use  the  comparison  operators  rather  than  the localeCompare method, but it’s always interesting to see more than one approach. See Also For more on string-to-number conversion, see Recipe 4.5.  1.4  Finding a Substring in a String Problem You want to find out if a substring, a particular series of characters, exists in a string. Solution Use the String object’s built-in indexOf method to find the position of the substring, if it exists:  var testValue = "This is the Cookbook's test string"; var subsValue = "Cookbook";  var iValue = testValue.indexOf subsValue ;    returns value of 12, index of substring  if  iValue != -1     succeeds, because substring exists  Discussion The String indexOf method returns a number representing the index, or position of the first character of the substring, with 0 being the index position of the first character in the string. To test if the substring doesn’t exist, you can compare the returned value to –1, which is the value returned if the substring isn’t found:  if  iValue != -1     true if substring found  The indexOf method takes two parameters: the substring, and an optional second pa- rameter, an index value of where to begin a search:  8  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   var tstString = "This apple is my apple"; var iValue = tstString.indexOf "apple", 10 ;    returns 17, index of second substring  The indexOf method works from left to right, but sometimes you might want to find the index of a substring by searching within the string from right to left. There’s another String method, lastIndexOf, which returns the index position of the last occurrence of a substring within a string:  var txtString = "This apple is my apple"; var iValue = tstString.lastIndexOf "apple" ;    returns 17,                                               index of last occurrence of substring  Like indexOf, lastIndexOf also takes an optional second parameter, which is an index value of where to start the search, counted from the right:  "This apple is my apple".lastIndexOf "apple" ;    returns value of 17 "This apple is my apple".lastIndexOf "apple",12 ;    returns value of 5 "This apple is my apple".lastIndexOf "apple", 3 ;    returns value of -1, not found  Notice that the value returned from lastIndexOf changes based on the starting position, as counted from the string’s right.  It’s odd to see a String method called directly on quoted text, but in JavaScript, there’s no difference in calling the method on a string literal, directly, or on a string variable.  See Also The String method search is used with regular expressions in order to find a specific pattern within a string, and is discussed in Recipe 2.3. The String method replace can be used to replace a substring found using a regular expression, and is discussed in Recipe 2.4.  1.5  Extracting a Substring from a String Problem You have a string with several sentences, one of which has a list of items. The list begins with a colon  :  and ends with a period  . . You want to extract just the list. Solution Use the indexOf String method to locate the colon, and then use it again to find the first period following the colon. With these two locations, extract the string using the String substring method:  var sentence = "This is one sentence. This is a sentence with a list of items: cherries, oranges, apples, bananas.";  1.5  Extracting a Substring from a String  9   var start = sentence.indexOf ":" ; var end = sentence.indexOf ".", start+1 ;  var list = sentence.substring start+1, end ;  Discussion The  list  is  delimited  by  a  beginning  colon  character  and  an  ending  period.  The indexOf method is used without the second parameter in the first search, to find the colon. The method is used again, but the colon’s position  plus 1  is used to modify the beginning location of the search for the period:  var end = sentence.indexOf ".",start+1 ;  If we didn’t modify the search for the ending period, we would have ended up with the location of the first sentence’s period, rather than the location of the second sentence’s period. Once we have the beginning and ending location for the list, we use the  substring method, passing in the two index values representing the beginning and ending posi- tions of the string:  var list = sentence.substring start+1, end ;  The resulting string in list is:  cherries, oranges, apples, bananas  We could then use a method, such as String.split to split the list into its individual values:  var fruits = list.split ","  ;    array of values  There is another string extraction method, substr, but it’s based on the index position of the start of the substring, and then passing in the length of the substring as the second parameter. In a real life application, we won’t know the length of the sentence. See Also See Recipe 1.7 for more on using the String.split method.  1.6  Checking for an Existing, Nonempty String Problem You want to check that a variable is defined, is a string, and is not empty.  10  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   Solution Use a combination of the typeof operator, the general valueOf method  which all Java- Script objects share , and the String length property to create a conditional test that ensures a variable is set, is a string, and is not empty:     true if variable exists, is a string, and has a length greater than zero if   typeof unknownVariable != "undefined"  &&       typeof unknownVariable.valueOf   == "string"   &&      unknownVariable.length > 0   {    ... }  Discussion Probably  the  most  important  built-in  property  for  String  is  length.  You  can  use length to find out how long the string is, and to test whether the string variable is an empty string  zero length  or not:  if  strFromFormElement.length == 0     testing for empty string  However, when you’re working with strings and aren’t sure whether they’re set, you can’t just check their length, as you’ll get an undefined JavaScript error if the variable has never been set. You have to combine the length test with another test for existence, and this brings us to the typeof operator. The JavaScript typeof operator returns the type of a variable. The list of possible re- turned values are:    "number" if variable is a number   "string" if variable is a string   "boolean" if variable is a Boolean   "function" if variable is a function   "object" if variable is null, an array, or another JavaScript object   "undefined" if variable is undefined  The last value is what interests us right now, because a variable that has never been defined has a data type of undefined. When a data type test is combined with a test of string length via a logical AND  &&  operator, the only time the entire statement will succeed is if the variable has been defined, and it contains a string with a length longer than zero:     succeeds if variable exists, and has length greater than zero if   typeof unknownVariable !== "undefined"  &&  unknownVariable.length >    {   ... }  1.6  Checking for an Existing, Nonempty String  11   If the first test fails—whether the variable has been defined—the second condition isn’t processed, as the entire statement fails. This prevents the error of accessing a property on an undefined variable. The conditional statement in the last code snippet works, but what happens if the variable is defined, but is not a string? For instance, if the variable is a number? Well, in this case, the condition still fails, because the  length property is undefined for a number. However, what if the value is a String object? If  you’re  not  sure  what  type  the  variable  is,  you  can  also  explicitly  test  for  the "string" data type before testing the length:     succeeds if string with length greater than zero if   typeof unknownVariable == "string"  &&  unknownVariable.length > 0   {  ... }  If the test succeeds, you know exactly what you have: a string, with a length greater than zero. However, if the variable is a String object, not a literal, typeof returns a data type of "object" not "string". That’s why the solution incorporates another JavaScript object method, valueOf. The valueOf method is available for all JavaScript objects, and returns the primitive value of whatever the object is: for Number, String, and boolean, their primitive values; for  Function,  the  function  text,  and  so  on.  So  if  the  variable  is  a  String  object, valueOf returns a string literal. If the variable is already a string literal, applying the valueOf  method  to  it  temporarily  wraps  it  in  a  String  object,  which  means  the valueOf method will still return a string literal. Our conditional test then ends up incorporating a test to see if the variable has been set, and if so, whether it is a String object or literal using valueOf, and, finally, whether the length of the string is greater than zero:     true if variable exists, is a string, and has a length greater than zero if   typeof unknownVariable != "undefined"  &&       typeof unknownVariable.valueOf   == "string"   &&      unknownVariable.length > 0   {    ... }  Seems like a lot of work, but typically your application won’t have to be this extensive when testing a value. Generally you’ll only need to test whether a variable has been set, or find the length of a string, in order to ensure it’s not an empty string.  12  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   1.7  Breaking a Keyword String into Separate Keywords Problem You have a string with keywords, separated by commas. You want to break the string into an array of separate keywords, and then print the keywords out with a keyword label. Solution Use the String split method to split the string on the commas. Loop through the array, printing out the separate values. Example 1-1 shows a complete web page demonstrat- ing this approach. The keywords are provided by the web page reader, via a prompt window, and are then processed and printed out to the web page.  Example 1-1. Demonstrating use of String split to get keyword list       Example 1-1       window.onload = function   {        get keyword list     var keywordList = prompt "Enter keywords, separated by commas","" ;        use split to create array of keywords    var  arrayList = keywordList.split "," ;        build result HTML    var resultString = "";    for  var i = 0; i < arrayList.length; i++  {      resultString+="keyword: " + arrayList[i] + " ";    }        print out to page    var  blk = document.getElementById "result" ;    blk.innerHTML = resultString; }                 1.7  Breaking a Keyword String into Separate Keywords   13   Discussion The String split method takes two parameters: a required parameter with the char- acter representing the separator for the split method; the second parameter  optional  is a number representing a count of the number of splits to make. In Example 1-1, the separator is a comma  , , and no second parameter is provided. An example of using the second parameter is the following:  var strList = "keyword1,keyword2,keyword3,keyword4";  The following split method call would generate an array with two entries:  var arrayList = strList.split ",",2 ;    results in two element array  Not specifying the second parameter will split on every occurrence of the separator found:  var arrayList = strList.split "," ;    results in four element array  Here’s an interesting use of split: if you want to split a string on every character, specify the empty string  ''  or  ""  as the separator:  var arrayList = strList.split "" ;  You can also use a regular expression as the parameter to split, though this can be a little tricky. For instance, to find the same sentence list as returned from the example code in the solution, you could use a couple of regular expressions:  var sentence = "This is one sentence. This is a sentence with a list of items:  cherries, oranges, apples, bananas."; var val = sentence.split  :  ; alert val[1].split  \.  [0] ;  The regular expression looks for a colon first, which is then used for the first split. The second split uses a regular expression on the resulting value from the first split, to look for the period. The list is then in the first array element of this result. Tricky, and a little hard to get your head around, but using regular expressions with split could be a handy option when nothing else works. See Also See Recipe 5.3 for a discussion about creating a string from an array. See Recipe 11.1 about accessing a page element with the document object, and Recipe 12.1 about using the  innerHTML  property.  Chapter  2  provides  coverage  of  regular  expressions.  Rec- ipe 2.6 covers using capturing parentheses and a regular expression to get the same results as the solutions demonstrated in this recipe.  14  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   1.8  Inserting Special Characters Problem You want to insert a special character, such as a line feed, into a string. Solution Use one of the escape sequences in the string. For instance, to add the copyright symbol into a block of text to be added to the page  shown in Figure 1-1 , use the escape sequence \u00A9:  var resultString = " This page \u00A9 Shelley Powers  ";     print out to page  var blk = document.getElementById "result" ;  blk.innerHTML = resultString;  Figure 1-1. Page demonstrating use of escape sequence to create copyright symbol  Discussion The escape sequences in JavaScript all begin with the backslash character,  \ . This character lets the application processing the string know that what follows is a sequence of characters that need special handling. Table 1-2 lists the other escape sequences.  1.8  Inserting Special Characters   15   Table 1-2. Escape sequences  Sequence \' \" \\ \b \f \n \r \t \ddd \xdd \udddd  Character Single quote Double quote Backslash Backspace Form feed Newline Carriage return Horizontal tab Octal sequence  3 digits: ddd  Hexadecimal sequence  2 digits: dd  Unicode sequence  4 hex digits: dddd   The last three escape sequences in Table 1-2 are patterns, where providing different numeric values will result in differing escape sequences. The copyright symbol in the solution is an example of the Unicode sequence. All of the escape sequences listed in Table 1-2 can also be represented as a Unicode sequence. For instance, the horizontal tab  \t , can also be represented as the Unicode escape sequence, \u0009. Of course, if the user agent disregards the special character, as browsers do with the horizontal tab, the use is moot. One of the most common uses of escape sequences is to include double or single quotes within strings delimited by the same character:  var newString = 'You can\'t use single quotes in a string surrounded by single  quotes';  1.9  Processing Individual Lines of a textarea Problem You want to be able to process individual lines from a textarea box. Solution Use the String split method, combined with the  line break escape sequence  \n  to split the contents of the textarea into its separate lines:  var txtBox = document.getElementById "inputbox" ; var lines = txtBox.value.split "\n" ;     print out last line to page  16  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   var blk = document.getElementById "result" ; blk.innerHTML = lines[lines.length-1];  Discussion Escape sequences can be used for more than building strings; they can also be used in pattern-matching operations. In the solution, the textarea string is split into its separate lines by looking for the escape sequence for the newline character  \n . This approach is also a way to convert text that may be encoded with escape sequences, such as the newline character, into properly formatted HTML. For instance, to modify the example to output the textarea exactly as typed, but as HTML, use the following:     get textarea string and split on new lines var txtBo x = document.getElementById "test" ; var lines = txtBox.value.split "\n" ;     generate HTML version of text var resultString  = " "; for  var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++  {    resultString += lines[i] + " "; } resultString += " ";     print out to page var blk = document.getElementById "result" ; blk.innerHTML = resultString;  This code snippet converts all line breaks into the HTML br element. When added back to the page, the text is printed as it was found in the textarea, line breaks and all. This is a popular technique used to echo comments, as they are typed for a live preview, in many blogs. See Also Another approach to replacing characters in a string is to use a regular expression with the String replace method, covered in Recipe 2.5.  1.10  Trimming Whitespace from the Ends of a String Problem You want to trim the whitespace around a string that you’ve accessed from a form element. Solution Use the new ECMAScript 5 String trim method:  var txtBox = document.getElementById "test" ; var lines = txtBox.value.split "\n" ;  1.10  Trimming Whitespace from the Ends of a String  17   var resultString = "";  for  var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++  {    var strng = lines[i].trim  ;    resultString += strng + "-"; } alert resultString ;  Discussion Prior to the release of ECMAScript 5, you had to use regular expressions and the String replace method to trim the unwanted whitespace from around a string. Now, trimming a string is as simple as calling the trim method.  Firefox already supported a trim method, but its use was nonstandard before ECMAScript 5.  Most, if not all, browsers will eventually support trim. Among the target browsers for this book, the only one that doesn’t is IE8. A workaround you can use is outlined below, which not only allows for the use of trim, but a fallback if trim does not exist. First, at some point before you need to use the trim functionality, you must test to see if trim exists as a property of the String object. If it doesn’t, you’ll need to use the String prototype to add a customized trim method to the object:  if  typeof String.trim == "undefined"  {    String.prototype.trim = function   {       return this.replace   ^\s*  \s*$  g, "" ;    } }  Once this code is processed, when you call the trim method on any string, it will return a string with whitespace trimmed from both ends  as long as the application is within page scope . This functionality happens regardless of whether the method is already built-in by the browser, or added by your hack:  var strng = lines[1].trim  ;  Most of the JavaScript framework libraries, such as jQuery, which I in- troduce in Chapter 17, have already added the trim method.  Other new, related methods from ECMAScript 5 are trimLeft, which trims the white- space on the left side of the string, and trimRight, which does the same on the right side of the string.  18  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   See Also The use of regular expressions is covered in Chapter 2. The use of the JavaScript object prototype property is covered in Recipe 16.3.  1.11  Left- or Right-Pad a String Problem You need to create a string that’s left- or right-padded with a given character. Solution Test the length of the string, then generate a padding string consisting of duplications of a given character to either concatenate to the original string  if padding to the right  or attaching to the beginning of the string  if padding to the left . The following left- pads the existing string with the nonbreaking space named character  &nbsp; :       Recipe 1.12               var prefLineLength = 20;    var oldStr = "This is a string";     var diff = prefLineLength - oldStr.length;    var filler = '&nbsp;';     for  var i = 0; i < diff; i++  {       oldStr=filler + oldStr;    }    document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=oldStr;       Discussion You don’t want to pad strings that go into a database, because you want to keep the data in the database as small and efficient as possible. But you might want to pad the value before you display it in the web page. The characters you use to pad the string are guided by the use. Typically, you’ll use spaces. However, if the value is inserted into a web page that disregards multiple spaces,  1.11  Left- or Right-Pad a String  19   you’ll either have to use the named entity  &nbsp;  or its numeric equivalent &160;  if your content needs to be XHTML-compatible. Or you can just use CSS to format the text positioning. For instance, to right-align the text, create the CSS rule:  .rightformatted {    text-align: right: }  And then apply the rule when you add the string to the page. You can use the CSS rule as a class name with the innerHTML property: var div = document.getElementById "item" ; item.innerHTML=" " + strValue + " ";   or you can use DOM  Document Object Model  Level 2 functionality:  var num = 123.55; var item = document.getElementById "item" ;     create text node and paragraph element var txt = document.createTextNode num ; var p = document.createElement "p" ;     attach text node to paragraph p.appendChild txt ; p.setAttribute "class","rightformatted" ;     append paragraph to document element item.appendChild p ;  See Also See Chapters 11 and 12 for more on using the Document Object Model  DOM  to access, create, and remove web page elements and element attributes.  20  Chapter 1: Working with JavaScript Strings   CHAPTER 2 Using Regular Expressions  2.0  Introduction Regular expressions are search patterns that can be used to find text that matches a given pattern. For instance, in the last chapter, we looked for the substring Cookbook within a longer string:  var testValue = "This is the Cookbook's test string"; var subsValue = "Cookbook";  var iValue = testValue subsValue ;    returns value of 12, index of substring  This code snippet worked because we were looking for an exact match. But what if we wanted a more general search? For instance, we want to search for the words Cook and Book, in strings such as “Joe’s Cooking Book” or “JavaScript Cookbook”? When we’re looking for strings that match a pattern rather than an exact string, we need to use regular expressions. We can try to make do with String functions, but in the end, it’s actually simpler to use regular expressions, though the syntax and format is a little odd and not necessarily “user friendly.” Recently, I was looking at code that pulled the RGB values from a string, in order to convert  the  color  to  its  hexadecimal  format.  We’re  tempted  to  just  use  the String.split function, and split on the commas, but then you have to strip out the parentheses and extraneous whitespace. Another consideration is how can we be sure that the values are in octal format? Rather than:  rgb  255, 0, 0   we might find:  rgb  100%, 0, 0   There’s an additional problem: some browsers return a color, such as a background color, as an RGB value, others as a hexadecimal. You need to be able to handle both when building a consistent conversion routine.  21   In the end, it’s a set of regular expressions that enable us to solve what, at first, seems to be a trivial problem, but ends up being much more complicated. In an example from the popular jQuery UI library, regular expressions are used to match color values—a complicated task because the color values can take on many different formats, as this portion of the routine demonstrates:     Look for a0b1c2 if  result =   [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  .exec color      return [parseInt result[1],16 , parseInt result[2],16 , parseInt result[3],16 ];     Look for fff if  result =   [a-fA-F0-9]  [a-fA-F0-9]  [a-fA-F0-9]  .exec color       return [parseInt result[1]+result[1],16 , parseInt result[2]+result[2],16 , parseInt result[3]+result[3],16 ];     Look for rgba 0, 0, 0, 0  == transparent in Safari 3 if  result =  rgba\ 0, 0, 0, 0\  .exec color       return colors['transparent'];     Otherwise, we're most likely dealing with a named color     return colors[$.trim color .toLowerCase  ];  Though the regular expressions seem complex, they’re really nothing more than a way to  describe  a  pattern.  In  JavaScript,  regular  expressions  are  managed  through  the RegExp object. A RegExp Literal As with String in Chapter 1, RegExp can be both a literal and an object. To create a RegExp literal, you use the following syntax:  var re =  regular expression ;  The  regular  expression  pattern  is  contained  between  opening  and  closing  forward slashes. Note that this pattern is not a string: you do not want to use single or double quotes  around  the  pattern,  unless  the  quotes  themselves  are  part  of  the  pattern  to match. Regular expressions are made up of characters, either alone or in combination with special characters, that provide for more complex matching. For instance, the following is a regular expression for a pattern that matches against a string that contains the word Shelley and the word Powers, in that order, and separated by one or more whitespace characters:  var re =  Shelley\s+Powers ;  The special characters in this example are the backslash character  \ , which has two purposes: either it’s used with a regular character, to designate that it’s a special char- acter; or it’s used with a special character, such as the plus sign  + , to designate that the character should be treated literally. In this case, the backslash is used with “s”, which transforms the letter s to a special character designating a whitespace character,  22  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   such as a space, tab, line feed, or form feed. The \s special character is followed by the plus sign, \s+, which is a signal to match the preceding character  in this example, a whitespace character  one or more times. This regular expression would work with the following:  Shelley Powers  It would also work with the following:  Shelley     Powers  It would not work with:  ShelleyPowers  It doesn’t matter how much whitespace is between Shelley and Powers, because of the use  of  \s+.  However,  the  use  of  the  plus  sign  does  require  at  least  one  whitespace character. Table 2-1 shows the most commonly used special characters in JavaScript applications.  Table 2-1. Regular expression special characters  Character ^ $ * ? + {n} {n,}  Matches Matches beginning of input Matches end of input Matches zero or more times Matches zero or one time Matches one or more times Matches exactly n times Matches n or more times  {n,m} . [...] [^...] \b \B \d \D \w \W  \n \s  Matches at least n, at most m times Any character except newline Any character within brackets Any character but those within brackets Matches on word boundary Matches on nonword boundary Digits from 0 to 9 Any nondigit character Matches word character  letters, digits, underscores  Matches any nonword character  not letters, digits, or underscores  Matches a line feed A single whitespace character       Example  ^This  matches “This is...”  end?  matches “This is the end”  se*  matches “seeee” as well as “se”  ap?  matches “apple” and “and”  ap+  matches “apple” but not “and”  ap{2}  matches “apple” but not “apie”  ap{2,}  matches all p’s in “apple” and “appple” but not “apie”  ap{2,4}  matches four p’s in “apppppple”  a.e  matches “ape” and “axe”  a[px]e  matches “ape” and “axe” but not “ale”  a[^px]  matches “ale” but not “axe” or “ape”  \bno  matches the first “no” in “nono”  \Bno  matches the second “no” in “nono”  \d{3}  matches 123 in “Now in 123”  \D{2,4}  matches “Now " in “Now in 123”  \w  matches “j” in javascript \ W  matches “%” in “100%”  2.0  Introduction  23   Character \S \t  x   Matches A single character that is not whitespace A tab Capturing parentheses  Example     Remembers the matched characters  RegExp As Object The RegExp is a JavaScript object as well as a literal, so it can also be created using a constructor, as follows:  var re = new RegExp "Shelley\s+Powers" ;  When to use which? The RegExp literal is compiled when script is evaluated, so you should use a RegExp literal when you know the expression won’t change. A compiled version is more efficient. Use the constructor when the expression changes or is going to be built or provided at runtime. As with other JavaScript objects, RegExp has several properties and methods, the most common of which are demonstrated throughout this chapter.  Regular expressions are powerful but can be tricky. This chapter is more an introduction to how regular expressions work in JavaScript than to regular expressions in general. If you want to learn more about regular expressions,  I  recommend  the  excellent  Regular  Expressions  Cook book by Jan Goyvaerts and Steven Levithan  O’Reilly .  See Also The jQuery function shown in the first section is a conversion of a jQuery internal function incorporated into a custom jQuery plug-in. jQuery is covered in more detail in Chapter 17, and a jQuery plug-in is covered in Recipe 17.7.  2.1  Testing Whether a Substring Exists Problem You want to test whether a string is contained in another string. Solution Use a JavaScript regular expression to define a search pattern, and then apply the pat- tern against the string to be searched, using the RegExp test method. In the following, we want to match with any string that has the two words, Cook and Book, in that order:  var cookbookString = new Array  ;  24  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   cookbookString[0] = "Joe's Cooking Book"; cookbookString[1] = "Sam's Cookbook"; cookbookString[2] = "JavaScript CookBook"; cookbookString[3] = "JavaScript BookCook";     search pattern var pattern =  Cook.*Book ; for  var i = 0; i < cookbookString.length; i++    alert cookbookString[i] + " " + pattern.test cookbookString[i]  ;  The first and third strings have a positive match, while the second and fourth do not. Discussion The  RegExp  test  method  takes  two  parameters:  the  string  to  test,  and  an  optional modifier. It applies the regular expression against the string and returns true if there’s a match, false if there is no match. In the example, the pattern is the word Cook appearing somewhere in the string, and the word Book appearing anywhere in the string after Cook. There can be any number of characters between the two words, including no characters, as designated in the pattern by the two regular expression characters: the decimal point  . , and the asterisk  * . The decimal in regular expressions is a special character that matches any character except the newline character. In the example pattern, the decimal is followed by the  asterisk, which matches the preceding character zero or more times. Combined, they generate a pattern matching zero or more of any character, except newline. In the example, the first and third string match, because they both match the pattern of Cook and Book with anything in between. The fourth does not, because the Book comes before Cook in the string. The second also doesn’t match, because the first letter of book is lowercase rather than uppercase, and the matching pattern is case-dependent.  2.2  Testing for Case-Insensitive Substring Matches Problem You want to test whether a string is contained in another string, but you don’t care about the case of the characters in either string.  Solution When creating the regular expression, use the ignore case flag  i :  var cookbookString = new Array  ;  cookbookString[0] = "Joe's Cooking Book"; cookbookString[1] = "Sam's Cookbook"; cookbookString[2] = "JavaScript CookBook";  2.2  Testing for Case-Insensitive Substring Matches   25   cookbookString[3] = "JavaScript cookbook";     search pattern var pattern =  Cook.*Book i; for  var i = 0; i < cookbookString.length; i++  {   alert cookbookString[i] + " " + pattern.test cookbookString[i],i  ; }  All four strings match the pattern. Discussion The solution uses a regular expression flag  i  to modify the constraints on the pattern- matching. In this case, the flag removes the constraint that the pattern-matching has to match by case. Using this flag, values of book and Book would both match. There are only a few regular expression flags, as shown in Table 2-2. They can be used with RegExp literals:  var pattern =  Cook.*Book i;    the 'i' is the ignore flag  They can also be used when creating a RegExp object, via the optional second parameter:  var pattern = new RegExp "Cook.*Book","i" ;  Table 2-2. Regular expression flags  Flag g  i  m  Meaning Global match: matches across an entire string, rather than stopping at first match Ignores case Applies begin and end line special characters  ^ and $, respectively  to each line in a multiline string  2.3  Validating a Social Security Number Problem You need to validate whether a text string is a valid U.S.-based Social Security number  the identifier the tax people use to find us, here in the States . Solution Use the String match method and a regular expression to validate that a string is a Social Security number:  var ssn = document.getElementById "pattern" .value; var pattern =  ^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$ ; if  ssn.match pattern     alert "OK" ; else   alert "Not OK" ;  26  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   Discussion A U.S.-based Social Security number is a combination of nine numbers, typically in a sequence of three numbers, two numbers, and four numbers, with or without dashes in between. The numbers in a Social Security number can be matched with the digit special char- acter  \d . To look for a set number of digits, you can use the curly brackets surrounding the number of expected digits. In the example, the first three digits are matched with:  \d{3}  The second two sets of numbers can be defined using the same criteria. Since there’s only one dash between the sequences of digits, it can be given without any special character. However, if there’s a possibility the string will have a Social Security number without the dashes, you’d want to change the regular expression pattern to:  var pattern =  ^\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}$ ;  The question mark special character  ?  matches zero or exactly one of the preceding character—in this case, the dash  - . With this change, the following would match:  As would the following:  444-55-3333  555335555  But not the following, which has too many dashes:  555---60--4444  One other characteristic to check is whether the string consists of the Social Security number, and only the Social Security number. The beginning-of-input special character  ^  is used to indicate that the Social Security number begins at the beginning of the string, and the end-of-line special character  $  is used to indicate that the line termi- nates at the end of the Social Security number. Since we’re only interested in verifying that the string is a validly formatted Social Se- curity number, we’re using the String object’s match method. We could also have used the RegExp test method, but six of one, half dozen of the other; both approaches are acceptable. There are other approaches to validating a Social Security number that are more com- plex, based on the principle that Social Security numbers can be given with spaces instead of dashes. That’s why most websites asking for a Social Security number provide three different input fields, in order to eliminate the variations. Regular expressions should not be used in place of good form design. In addition, there is no way to actually validate that the number given is an actual Social Security number, unless you have more information about the person, and a database with all Social Security numbers. All you’re doing with the regular expression is veri- fying the format of the number.  2.3  Validating a Social Security Number   27   See Also One site that provides some of the more complex Social Security number regular ex- pressions, in addition to many other interesting regular expression “recipes,” is the Regular Expression Library.  2.4  Finding and Highlighting All Instances of a Pattern Problem You want to find all instances of a pattern within a string. Solution Use the RegExp exec method and the global flag  g  in a loop to locate all instances of a pattern, such as any word that begins with t and ends with e, with any number of characters in between:  var searchString = "Now is the time and this is the time and that is the time"; var pattern =  t\w*e g; var matchArray;  var str = ""; while  matchArray = pattern.exec searchString   != null  {   str+="at " + matchArray.index + " we found " + matchArray[0] + " "; } document.getElementById "results" .innerHTML=str;  Discussion The RegExp exec method executes the regular expression, returning null if a match is not found, or an array of information if a match is found. Included in the returned array is the actual matched value, the index in the string where the match is found, any parenthetical substring matches, and the original string.  index  input  The index of the located match  The original input string [0] or accessing array directly  The matched value  [1],...,[n]  Parenthetical substring matches  28  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions  In the solution, the index where the match was found is printed out in addition to the matched value.   The solution also uses the global flag  g . This triggers the RegExp object to preserve the location of each match, and to begin the search after the previously discovered match. When used in a loop, we can find all instances where the pattern matches the string. In the solution, the following are printed out:  at 7 we found the at 11 we found time at 28 we found the at 32 we found time at 49 we found the at 53 we found time  Both time and the match the pattern. Let’s look at the nature of global searching in action. In Example 2-1, a web page is created with a textarea and an input text box for accessing both a search string and a pattern. The pattern is used to create a RegExp object, which is then applied against the string. A result string is built, consisting of both the unmatched text and the matched text, except the matched text is surrounded by a span element, with a CSS class used to  highlight  the  text.  The  resulting  string  is  then  inserted  into  the  page,  using  the innerHTML for a div element.  Example 2-1. Using exec and global flag to search and highlight all matches in a text string         Searching for strings    searchSubmit {    background-color: ff0;    width: 200px;    text-align: center;    padding: 10px;    border: 2px inset ccc; } .found {    background-color: ff0; }       <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {    document.getElementById "searchSubmit" .onclick=doSearch; }  function doSearch   {       get pattern    var pattern = document.getElementById "pattern" .value;    var re = new RegExp pattern,"g" ;  2.4  Finding and Highlighting All Instances of a Pattern  29         get string    var searchString = document.getElementById "incoming" .value;     var matchArray;    var resultString = " ";    var first=0; var last=0;        find each match    while  matchArray = re.exec searchString   != null  {      last = matchArray.index;         get all of string up to match, concatenate      resultString += searchString.substring first, last ;          add matched, with class      resultString += " " + matchArray[0] + " ";      first = re.lastIndex;    }        finish off string    resultString += searchString.substring first,searchString.length ;    resultString += " ";        insert into page    document.getElementById "searchResult" .innerHTML = resultString; }    -->                Search pattern:       Search for pattern          Figure 2-1 shows the application in action on William Wordsworth’s poem, “The Kit- ten and the Falling Leaves,” after a search for the following pattern:  lea fve   The bar    is a conditional test, and will match a word based on the value on either side of the bar. So a word like leaf matches, as well as a word like leave, but not a word like leap. You can access the last index found through the RegExp’s lastIndex property. The lastIndex property is handy if you want to track both the first and last matches.  30  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   Figure 2-1. Application finding and highlighting all matched strings See Also Recipe  2.5  describes  another  way  to  do  a  standard  find-and-replace  behavior,  and Recipe 2.6 provides a simpler approach to finding and highlighting text in a string.  2.5  Replacing Patterns with New Strings Problem You want to replace all matched substrings with a new substring. Solution Use the String object’s replace method, with a regular expression:  var searchString = "Now is the time, this is the time"; var re =  t\w{2}e g; var replacement = searchString.replace re, "place" ; alert replacement ;    Now is the place, this is the place  2.5  Replacing Patterns with New Strings   31   Discussion In Example 2-1 in Recipe 2.4, we used the RegExp global flag  g  in order to track each occurrence of the regular expression. Each match was highlighted using a span element and CSS. A global search is also handy for a typical find-and-replace behavior. Using the global flag  g  with the regular expression in combination with the String replace method will replace all instances of the matched text with the replacement string. See Also Recipe  2.6  demonstrates  variations  of  using  regular  expressions  with  the  String replace method.  2.6  Swap Words in a String Using Capturing Parentheses Problem You want to accept an input string with first and last name, and swap the names so the last name is first. Solution Use  capturing  parentheses  and  a  regular  expression  to  find  and  remember  the  two names in the string, and reverse them:  var name = "Abe Lincoln"; var re =  ^ \w+ \s \w+ $ ; var newname = name.replace re,"$2, $1" ;  Discussion Capturing parentheses allow us to not only match specific patterns in a string, but to reference the matched substrings at a later time. The matched substrings are referenced numerically, from left to right, as represented by the use of “$1” and “$2” in the String replace method. In the solution, the regular expression matches two words, separated by a space. Cap- turing parentheses were used with both words, so the first name is accessible using “$1”, the last name with “$2”. The captured parentheses aren’t the only special characters available with the String replace method. Table 2-3 shows the other special characters that can be used with regular expressions and replace.  32  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   Table 2-3. String.replace special patterns  Pattern $$ $& $` $’ $n  Purpose Allows a literal dollar sign  $  in replacement Inserts matched substring Inserts portion of string before match Inserts portion of string after match Inserts nth captured parenthetical value when using RegExp  The second table entry, which reinserts the matched substring, can be used to provide a simplified version of the Example 2-1 application in Recipe 2.4. That example found and provided markup and CSS to highlight the matched substring. It used a loop to find and replace all entries, but in Example 2-2 we’ll use the String replace method with the matched substring special pattern  $&   Example 2-2. Using String.replace and special pattern to find and highlight text in a string         Searching for strings    searchSubmit {    background-color: ff0;    width: 200px;    text-align: center;    padding: 10px;    border: 2px inset ccc; } .found {    background-color: ff0; }       <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {    document.getElementById "searchSubmit" .onclick=doSearch; }  function doSearch   {       get pattern    var pattern = document.getElementById "pattern" .value;    var re = new RegExp pattern,"g" ;        get string    var searchString = document.getElementById "incoming" .value;        replace  2.6  Swap Words in a String Using Capturing Parentheses   33      var resultString = searchString.replace re," $& " ;        insert into page    document.getElementById "searchResult" .innerHTML = resultString; }    -->                Search pattern:       Search for pattern          This  is  a  simpler  alternative,  but  as  Figure  2-2  shows,  this  technique  doesn’t  quite preserve all aspects of the original string. The line feeds aren’t preserved with Exam- ple 2-2, but they are with Example 2-1. The captured text can also be accessed via the RegExp object when you use the RegExp exec method. Now let’s return to the Recipe 2.6 solution code, but this time using the RegExp’s exec method:  var name = "Shelley Powers"; var re =  ^ \w+ \s \w+ $ ; var result = re.exec name ; var newname = result[2] + ", " + result[1];  This approach is handy if you want to access the capturing parentheses values, but without having to use them within a string replacement. To see another example of using capturing parentheses, Recipe 1.7 demonstrated a couple of ways to access the list of items in the following sentence, using the String split method:  var sentence = "This is one sentence. This is a sentence with a list of items: cherries, oranges, apples, bananas.";  Another approach is the following, using capturing parentheses, and the RegExp exec method:  var re =  : .* \. ; var result = re.exec sentence ; var list = result[1];    cherries, oranges, apples, bananas  34  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   Figure 2-2. Using Example 2-2 to find and highlight text in a string  2.7  Using Regular Expressions to Trim Whitespace Problem Before sending a string to the server via an Ajax call, you want to trim whitespace from the beginning and end of the string. Solution Prior to the new ECMAScript 5 specification, you could use a regular expression to trim whitespace from the beginning and end of a string:  var testString = "   this is the string    ";     trim white space from the beginning testString = testString.replace  ^\s+ ,"" ;     trim white space from the end testString = testString.replace  \s+$ ,"" ;  Beginning with ECMAScript 5, the String object now has a trim method:  2.7  Using Regular Expressions to Trim Whitespace  35   var testString = "    this is the string    "; testString = testString.trim  ;    white space trimmed  Discussion String values retrieved from form elements can sometimes have whitespace before and after the actual form value. You don’t usually want to send the string with the extra- neous whitespace, so you’ll use a regular expression to trim the string. Beginning  with  ECMAScript  5,  there’s  now  a  String trim  method.  However,  until ECMAScript 5 has wider use, you’ll want to check to see if the trim method exists, and if not, use the old regular expression method as a fail-safe method. In addition, there is no left or right trim in ECMAScript 5, though there are nonstandard versions of these methods in some browsers, such as Firefox. So if you want left- or right-only trim, you’ll want to create your own functions:  function leftTrim str  {    return str.replace  ^\s+ ,"" ; } function rightTrim str  {    return str.replace  \s+$ ,"" ; }  2.8  Replace HTML Tags with Named Entities Problem You want to paste example markup into a web page, and escape the markup—have the angle brackets print out rather than have the contents parsed. Solution Use regular expressions to convert angle brackets     into the named entities &lt; and &gt;:  var pieceOfHtml = " This is a  paragraph  "; pieceOfHtml = pieceOfHtml.replace  < g,"&lt;" ; pieceOfHtml = pieceOfHtml.replace  > g,"&gt;" ; document.getElementById "searchResult" .innerHTML = pieceOfHtml;  Discussion It’s not unusual to want to paste samples of markup into another web page. The only way to have the text printed out, as is, without having the browser parse it, is to convert all angle brackets into their equivalent named entities. The process is simple with the use of regular expressions, using the regular expression global flag  g  and the String replace method, as demonstrated in the solution.  36  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   2.9  Searching for Special Characters Problem We’ve searched for numbers and letters, and anything not a number or other character, but  one  thing  we  need  to  search  is  the  special  regular  expression  characters themselves. Solution Use the backslash to escape the pattern-matching character:  var re =  \\d ; var pattern = "\\d{4}"; var pattern2 = pattern.replace re,"\\D" ;  Discussion In the solution, a regular expression is created that’s equivalent to the special character, \d, used to match on any number. The pattern is, itself, escaped, in the string that needs to be searched. The number special character is then replaced with the special character that searches for anything but a number, \D. Sounds  a  little  convoluted,  so  I’ll  demonstrate  with  a  longer  application.  Exam- ple 2-3 shows a small application that first searches for a sequence of four numbers in a string, and replaces them with four asterisks  **** . Next, the application will modify the search pattern, by replacing the \d with \D, and then running it against the same string.  Example 2-3. Regular expression matching on regular expression characters         Replacement Insanity      <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {       search for \d   var re =  \\d ;   var pattern = "\\d{4}";   var str = "I want 1111 to find 3334 certain 5343 things 8484";   var re2 = new RegExp pattern,"g" ;   var str1 = str.replace re2,"****" ;   alert str1 ;   var pattern2 = pattern.replace re,"\\D" ;   var re3 = new RegExp pattern2,"g" ;   var str2 = str.replace re3, "****" ;   alert str2 ; }  2.9  Searching for Special Characters   37     -->         content       Here is the original string:  I want 1111 to find 3334 certain 5343 things 8484  The  first  string  printed  out  is  the  original  string  with  the  numbers  converted  into asterisks:  I want **** to find **** certain **** things ****  The second string printed out is the same string, but after the characters have been converted into asterisks:  ****nt 1111******** 3334******** 5343********8484  Though this example is short, it demonstrates some of the challenges when you want to search on regular expression characters themselves.  38  Chapter 2: Using Regular Expressions   CHAPTER 3 Dates, Time, and Timers  3.0  Introduction JavaScript’s date and time functionality is quite extensive, and more than sufficient for most applications. The Date object contains a number representing the date and time, rather than a string representation. The numeric value for the Date object is the number of seconds since January 01, 1970 UTC. Leap seconds are ignored. Strings used to create dates are parsed and converted into this numeric value. Older browsers required that this string be UTC  Coordinated Time Universal or Greenwich Mean Time  format. Beginning with ECMAScript 5, ISO 8601 parsing is supported, which I’ll cover later in the chapter. The Date Object Dates are managed through the Date object. You can create a date using a variety of techniques  see Recipe 3.1 for a discussion of different approaches , and modify the date using an extensive number of methods. You can also access every aspect of a date: year, month, day of week, time, and so on, using specialized get and set methods, described in Tables 3-1 and 3-2.  Table 3-1. Date object get methods  Method getDate  getDay  getFullYear  getHours  getMilliseconds  getMinutes  Purpose Returns day of the month  0–31  Returns day of the week  0–6  Returns 4-digit full year Returns local hour  0–23  Returns local milliseconds  0–999  Returns local minute  0–59   39   Method getMonth  getSeconds  getTime  getTimezoneOffset  getUTCDate  getUTCDay  getUTCFullYear  getUTCHours  getUTCMilliseconds  getUTCMinutes  getUTCMonth  getUTCSeconds  Purpose Returns local month  0–11  Returns local second  0–59  Returns number of seconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC Returns time zone from UTC Returns day of month in UTC time  0–31  method  Date  Returns day of the week in UTC time  0–6  Returns 4-digit UTC year Returns UTC hours  0–23  Returns UTC milliseconds  0–999  Returns UTC minutes  0–59  Returns UTC month  0–11  Returns UTC seconds  0–59   Table 3-2. Date object set methods  setMilliseconds  Method setDate  setFullYear  setHours  setMinutes  setMonth  setSeconds  setTime  setUTCDate  setUTCFullYear  setUTCHours  setUTCMilliseconds  setUTCMinutes  setUTCMonth  setUTCSeconds  Purpose Sets the day of month  1–31  Sets 4-digit full year Sets the hour  0–23   Sets the date’s milliseconds  0–999   Sets the date’s minutes  0–59   Sets the month  0–11   Sets the seconds  0–59   Sets the date’s time as milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC Sets the date’s day of month in UTC Sets the full year in UTC Sets the date’s hours in UTC Sets the date’s milliseconds in UTC Sets the date’s minutes in UTC Sets the month in UTC Sets the seconds in UTC  You can also calculate a future date by adding a number of days or weeks to any given date.  40  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   JavaScript Timers JavaScript also provides another way to work with time, through the use of recurring or  one-time-only  timers.  I’ve  always  thought  these  should  be  a  component  of  the Date object, but they’re actually Window object methods: setInterval and setTimeout. The difference between the two is that setInterval creates a recurring timer that re- fires until canceled, while setTimeout creates a one-time-only timer. Both take a timer value, in milliseconds, as well as an expression to evaluate when the timer fires.  3.1  Printing Out Today’s Date Problem You want to print out the current date and time to a web page. Solution Create a new Date object, without any parameters, and output its value to the web page:  var dtElem = document.getElementById "date" ; var dt = new Date  ; dtElem.innerHTML = " " + dt + " ";  Discussion When you construct a new Date object, you can pass various parameters to the con- structor to create a specific date:  var dt = new Date milliseconds ;    milliseconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC var dt2 = new Date dateString ;    string representing a valid date var dt3 = new Date year,month,date[,hour,minute,second,millisecond] ;  If you don’t specify the time parameters of a date, as shown in the last example, they’re set to zero by default. At a minimum, you must provide the month, day, and year. If you don’t provide any form of a date string to the Date constructor, the Date object is set to the local date and time of the computer used to access the web page. You can access components of the date using a variety of Date methods. You can directly print the entire date, as shown in the solution, and the resulting string will look like the following:  Thu Oct 01 2009 20:34:26 GMT-0500  CST   If  you  prefer  a  different  format,  you  can  access  the  individual  components  of  the Date, using methods such as getMonth, getFullYear, getTime, getDate, and then build the date string:  var dt = new Date  ; var month = dt.getMonth  ; month++;  3.1  Printing Out Today’s Date  41   var day = dt.getDate  ; var yr = dt.getFullYear  ; dtElem.innerHTML = " " + month + " " + day + " " + yr;  The above outputs the following string to the page:  10 1 2009  The month is a zero-based integer, which is why I had to increment the month value in the example to get the actual numeric month value. To get the month name, you’ll most likely want to use an array:  var months = ['January','February','March','April','May','June','July','August', 'September','October','November','December']; var month = dt.getMonth  ; var monthString = months[month];  3.2  Printing Out the UTC Date and Time Problem You want to print out the current UTC  universal time  date and time, rather than the local time. Solution Use the UTC JavaScript methods in order to access the current date and time as uni- versal time:  var dateElement = document.getElementById "date" ; var today = new Date  ; var utcDate = today.toUTCString  ; dateElement.innerHTML = " local datetime: " + today + " UTC datetime: " +  utcDate + " ";  Discussion The Date toUTCString method returns the date time string formatted in universal con- vention. This not only returns the UTC equivalent of the local datetime, it also returns it the UTC format, which varies just slightly from the datetime for the local time. The printout from the solution would be:  local datetime: Thu Oct 08 2009 13:58:35 GMT-0500  CDT  UTC datetime: Thu, 08 Oct 2009 18:58:35 GMT  There are a couple of differences between the two date printouts. First of all, the time zone designation differs, which we would expect. I’m currently in Central Daylight Time  CDT , which is five hours behind universal time  UTC GMT . In addition, the day of week in the UTC string is followed by a comma, which doesn’t occur with the local time printout.  42  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   Rather than the entire date string, you can access the UTC equivalent of the month, day,  year,  and  time  using  the  relevant  Date  methods.  Instead  of  getMonth,  use getUTCMonth, and so on. Using these getUTC methods with the local date, you could build a printout string identical to that given with the local time, or to match any other formatting, such as the ISO 8601 standard formatting. There are equivalent methods to set each of these values. See Also The get methods are detailed in Table 3-1 and the set methods are detailed in Table 3-2.  3.3  Printing Out an ISO 8601 Formatted Date Problem You need a date string with the date formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard format. Solution Construct the Date, access the individual elements, and create the ISO 8601 formatted string:   var dt = new Date  ;     get month and increment var mnth = dt.getUTCMonth  ; mnth++;  var day = dt.getUTCDate  ; if  day < 10  day="0" + day; var yr = dt.getUTCFullYear  ;  var hrs = dt.getUTCHours  ; if  hrs < 10  hrs = "0" + hrs;  var min = dt.getUTCMinutes  ; if  min < 10  min = "0" + min;  var secs = dt.getUTCSeconds  ; if  secs < 10  secs = "0" + secs;  var newdate = yr + "-" + mnth + "-" + day + "T" + hrs + ":" + min + ":" + secs + "Z";  Discussion The ISO 8601 is an international standard that defines a representation for both dates and  times.  It’s  not  unusual  for  applications  that  provide  APIs  to  require  ISO  8601  3.3  Printing Out an ISO 8601 Formatted Date  43   formatting. It’s also not unusual for most dates to and from APIs to be in UTC, rather than local time. The solution shows one variation of ISO 8601 formatting. Others are the following:    2009   2009-10   2009-10-15   2009-10-15T19:20   2009-10-15T19:20:20   2009-10-15T19:20:20.50  The values are year, month, date, then “T” to represent time, and hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of sections. The time zone also needs to be indicated. If the date is in UTC, the time zone is represented by the letter “Z”, as shown in the solution:  2009-10-15T14:42:51Z  Otherwise, the time zone is represented as +hh:mm to represent a time zone ahead of UTC, and -hh:mm to represent a time zone behind UTC. The solution assumes you want to access the current UTC time. If you need to convert a given date into an ISO 8601 formatted UTC date, create the Date using the date string, and  then  use  the  UTC  get  methods  to  get  the  date  components,  as  shown  in  the solution:  var dt = "October 15, 2009 15:10:10";  Eventually, you won’t need this special functionality to print out an ISO 8601 formatted date, because one of the new Date extensions released with ECMAScript 5 is a new method, toISOString:  var dt = "October 15, 2009 15:10:10"; alert dt.toISOString   ;  Currently  only  a  few  browsers  support  this  new  functionality   Firefox  3.5  and  the WebKit nightly . Until there is broader support, you’ll still need the functionality out- lined in the solution to output the correctly formatted ISO date. However, you can extend  the  function  to  check  for  the  existence  of  toISOString  first,  and  use  it  if supported. See Also A padding function, such as the one described in Recipe 1.10, can be used to pad the numbers. The W3C “Note on Date and Time Formats” describing the ISO 8601 format can be found at http:  www.w3.org TR NOTE-datetime.  44  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   3.4  Converting an ISO 8601 Formatted Date to a Format Acceptable to the Date Object Problem You need to convert an ISO 8601 formatted date string into values that can be used to create a new Date object. Solution Parse the ISO 8601 string into the individual date values, and use it to create a new JavaScript Date object:    var dtstr= "2009-10-15T14:42:51Z";    dtstr = dtstr.replace  \D g," " ;   var dtcomps = dtstr.split " " ;       modify month between 1 based ISO 8601 and zero based Date   dtcomps[1]--;    var convdt = new Date Date.UTC dtcomps[0],dtcomps[1],dtcomps[2],dtcomps[3],dtcomps[4],dtcomps[5]  ;  Discussion If you attempt to create a JavaScript Date with an ISO 8601 formatted string, you’ll get an invalid date error. Instead, you’ll have to convert the string into values that can be used with the JavaScript Date. The simplest way to parse an ISO 8601 formatted string is to use the String.split method. To facilitate the use of split, all nonnumeric characters are converted to one specific character. In the solution, the nonnumeric characters are converted to a space:  dtstr = dtstr.replace  \D g, " " ;  The ISO formatted string would be converted to:  2009 10 15 14 42 51  ISO months are one-based, in values of 1 through 12. To use the month value in Java- Script Dates, the month needs to be adjusted by subtracting 1:  dtcomps[1]--;  Finally, the new Date is created. To maintain the UTC setting, the Date object’s UTC method is used to create the date in universal time, which is then passed to the Date constructor:    var convdt = new Date Date.UTC dtcomps[0],dtcomps[1],dtcomps[2],dtcomps[3],dtcomps[4],dtcomps[5]  ;  3.4  Converting an ISO 8601 Formatted Date to a Format Acceptable to the Date Object   45   The task gets more challenging when you have to account for the different ISO 8601 formats. Example 3-1 shows a JavaScript application that contains a more complex JavaScript function that converts from ISO 8601 to allowable Date values. The first test in  the  function  ensures  that  the  ISO  8601  format  can  be  converted  to  a  JavaScript Date. This means that, at a minimum, the formatted string must have a month, day, and year.  Example 3-1. Converting ISO 8601 formatted dates to JavaScript Dates         Converting ISO 8601 date    dateSubmit {    background-color: ff0;    width: 200px;    text-align: center;    border: 1px solid ccc; }       <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {   document.getElementById "dateSubmit" .onclick=convertDate; }  function convertDate   {   var dtstr = document.getElementById "datestring" .value;   var convdate = convertISO8601toDate dtstr ;   document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=convdate; }  function convertISO8601toDate dtstr  {       replace anything but numbers by spaces   dtstr = dtstr.replace  \D g," " ;       trim any hanging white space   dtstr = dtstr.replace  \s+$ ,"" ;       split on space   var dtcomps = dtstr.split " " ;       not all ISO 8601 dates can convert, as is      unless month and date specified, invalid   if  dtcomps.length < 3  return "invalid date";      if time not provided, set to zero   if  dtcomps.length < 4  {     dtcomps[3] = 0;     dtcomps[4] = 0;     dtcomps[5] = 0;  46  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers     }       modify month between 1 based ISO 8601 and zero based Date   dtcomps[1]--;    var convdt = new Date Date.UTC dtcomps[0],dtcomps[1],dtcomps[2],dtcomps[3],dtcomps[4],dtcomps[5]  ;    return convdt.toUTCString  ; }    -->           Datestring in ISO 8601 format:        Convert Date           Another test incorporated into Example 3-1 is whether a time is given. If there aren’t enough array elements to cover a time, then the hours, minutes, and seconds are set to zero when the UTC date is created. There are other issues related to dates not covered in the application. For instance, if the ISO 8601 formatted string isn’t in UTC time, converting it to UTC can require additional code, both to parse the time zone and to adjust the date to incorporate the time zone. I’ll leave that as an individual exercise, though. Eventually, you won’t need this special processing, because ECMAScript 5 includes new support for ISO 8601 dates. This means you’ll be able to create a new Date object using an ISO 8601 formatted string. However, only a few browsers  Firefox 3.5 and WebKit-based browsers  currently support the new ISO 8601 formatting, so you’ll still need to provide the conversion functionality included in this section for the near future.  3.5  Creating a Specific Date Problem You want to create a Date object given a month, day, and year. Solution Construct a Date object, passing in the month, day, and year as parameters:  var month = 10;    Month 10, in zero based system, is November var day = 18;  3.5  Creating a Specific Date  47   var year = 1954; var dt = new Date year,month,day ;    time is set to zero by default  Discussion The month, day, and year are integer values passed into the Date constructor. Because the time values were not given, they’re set to zero by default. In the solution, a November date is wanted, which is typically written out as 11. How- ever, months with the Date object are zero-based, which means that November would be designated, numerically, as 10.  3.6  Scheduling a Future Date Problem You want to generate a future date. Solution Use a combination of the Date object’s get and set methods in order to create a future date. In the following, a new date is created that’s 10 days in the future:  var futureDate = new Date  ; futureDate.setDate futureDate.getDate   + 10 ;  Discussion You can use a combination of get and set methods to find either a future or past date. Which methods you use depends on how you want to derive the new date. If you want to add or subtract days, you’ll use getDate and setDate; for years, use getFullYear and setFullYear; for hours, use getHours and setHours; and so on. Here’s a list of the paired methods to use, and the incremental amounts:    getDate and setDate to adjust the date by days   getFullYear and setFullYear to adjust the date by years   getHours and setHours to adjust the date and time by hours   getSeconds and setSeconds to adjust the date and time by seconds   getMilliseconds and setMilliseconds to adjust the date and time by milliseconds   getMinutes and setMinutes to adjust the date and time by minutes  You can also use the UTC versions of the same methods. To derive a date in the past, subtract the unit by the amount of the change:  var pastDate = new Date  ; pastDate.setFullYears pastDate.getFullYears   - 18 ;  48  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   3.7  Tracking Elapsed Time Problem You want to track the elapsed time between events. Solution Create a Date object when the first event occurs, a new Date object when the second event occurs, and subtract the first from the second. The difference is in milliseconds; to convert to seconds, divide by 1,000:  var firstDate; window.onload=startTimer;  function startTimer  {   firstDate = new Date  ;   document.getElementById "date" .onclick=doEvent; }  function doEvent   {   var secondDate = new Date  ;   alert  secondDate - firstDate    1000 ; }  Discussion Some arithmetic operators can be used with Dates, but with interesting results. In the example, one Date can be subtracted from another, and the difference between the two is returned as milliseconds. However, if you “add” two dates together, the result is a string with the second Date concatenated to the first:  Thu Oct 08 2009 20:20:34 GMT-0500  CST Thu Oct 08 2009 20:20:31 GMT-0500  CST   If you divide the Date objects, again the Dates are converted to their millisecond value, and the result of dividing one by the other is returned. Multiplying two dates will return a very large millisecond result.  Only the Date subtraction operator really makes sense, but it’s interest- ing to see what happens with arithmetic operators and the Date object.  3.8  Creating a Timeout Problem You want to trigger a timeout based on an event.  3.8  Creating a Timeout   49   Solution Use the window.setTimeout method to create a one-time-only timer:  window.onload=function   {   setTimeout "alert 'timeout!' ",3000 ; }  Discussion The setTimeout method takes two parameters: the expression to process, and the time  in milliseconds  when the expression is evaluated. In the solution, the expression is code, contained in a text string, that’s processed three seconds after the setTimeout function is run. The first parameter can also be the name of a function:  setTimeout functionName, 2000 ;  In addition, you can create an expression that’s a combination of function and param- eters by providing the optional parameters after the time:  setTimeout functionName, 2000, param1, param2, ..., paramn ;  You can cancel a timeout, using the clearTimeout method:  var timer1 = setTimeout functionName, 2000 ; ... window.clearTimeout timer1 ;  There’s no absolute guarantee that the timer event fires when it is supposed to fire. Timers run on the same execution thread as all other User Interface  UI  events, such as mouse-clicks. All events are queued and blocked, including the timer event, until its turn. So, if you have several events in the queue ahead of the timer, the actual time could differ. Probably not enough to be noticeable to your application users, but a delay can happen. See Also John Resig offers an excellent discussion on how timers work, and especially the issues associated with event queues and single threads of execution, at http:  ejohn.org blog  how-javascript-timers-work .  3.9  Creating Recurring Timers Problem You need to run the same function several times at regular intervals.  50  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   Solution Use the Window.setInterval method to create a recurring timer:  var x = 0; setInterval moveElement,1000 ;  function moveElement   {    x+=10;   var left = x + "px";   document.getElementById "redbox" .style.left=left; }  Discussion Dynamic animations in a web page, SVG, or Canvas, are dependent on the setTime out and setInterval methods. In particular, any flashing, moving, or following type of animation is dependent on a timer calling a method at specified intervals. The setInterval method requires two parameters: the code or function to process, and the delay between timer events. The first parameter can be a function name:  setInterval functionName,3000 ;  The first parameter can also be a function call with parameters in a text string:  setInterval  "alert 'hello' ", 3000 ;  The second parameter is the time, in milliseconds, of the timer delay. Unlike setTime out,  discussed  in  Recipe  3.8,  the  setInterval  timer  will  continue  to  cycle  until  the JavaScript application  the web page  is unloaded, or until the clearInterval method is called:  var intervalid = setInterval functionName, 3000 ; ... clearInterval intervalid ;  If the first parameter is a function name, you can pass parameters, optionally, following the timer delay:  setInterval functionName, 2000, param1, param2, ..., paramn ;  Being able to pass parameters to the function is handy if you’re creating an animation and generating the parameters dynamically. Unfortunately, passing parameters in this way doesn’t work with IE8. However, you can instead use function closures with the timer, as covered in Recipe 3.10.  3.9  Creating Recurring Timers   51   3.10  Using Function Closures with Timers Problem You want to provide a function with a timer, but you want to add the function directly into the timer method call. Solution Use an anonymous function as first parameter to the setInterval or setTimeout method call:  var x = 10; var intervalId=setInterval function   {           x+=5;           var left = x + "px";           document.getElementById "redbox" .style.left=left;}, 100 ;  Discussion Recipes 3.8 and 3.9 use a function variable as the first parameter to the timer methods. However, you can also use an anonymous function, as demonstrated in the solution. This approach is especially helpful, because rather than have to use a global value that’s used in the timer function, you can use a variable local to the scope of the enclosing function. Example 3-2 demonstrates the use of an anonymous function within a setInterval method call. The approach also demonstrates how the use of this function closure allows access to the parent function’s local variables within the timer method. In the example, clicking the red box starts the timer, and the box moves. Clicking the box again clears the timer, and the box stops. The position of the box is tracked in the x variable, which is within scope for the timer function, since it operates within the scope of the parent function.  Example 3-2. Using an anonymous function within a setInterval timer parameter       interval and anonymous function    redbox {   position: absolute;   left: 100px;   top: 100px;   width: 200px; height: 200px;   background-color: red; }      52  Chapter 3: Dates, Time, and Timers   var intervalId=null;  window.onload=function   {   document.getElementById "redbox" .onclick=stopStartElement; } function stopStartElement   {     if  intervalId == null  {        var x = 100;        intervalId=setInterval function   {                         x+=5;                         var left = x + "px";                         document.getElementById "redbox" .style.left=left;}, 100 ;     } else {        clearInterval intervalId ;        intervalId=null;     } }             See Also See more on functions as parameters and anonymous functions in Chapter 6, especially Recipe 6.5.  3.10  Using Function Closures with Timers   53    CHAPTER 4 Working with Numbers and Math  4.0  Introduction Numbers and numeric operations in JavaScript are managed by two different JavaScript objects: Number and Math. Like the String and RegExp objects discussed in earlier chapters, numbers can be both a literal value and an object. No surprises there, but the Math object is different: it has no constructor, and all properties and methods are accessed directly from the object. The Number Object and Number Literal Numbers in JavaScript are floating point, though there may not be a decimal compo- nent present. If no decimal is present, they act as if they’re integers:  var someValue = 10;    treated as integer 10, in base 10  Numbers can be defined in the range of –253 to 253. Most numbers in JavaScript are literal values, assigned as values to variables, and used in various computations:  var myNum = 3.18; var newNum = myNum * someValue;  You can also construct a Number using a constructor method:  var newNum = new Number 23 ;  You can assign a literal number to a variable, but when you access a Number method on the variable, a Number object is created to wrap the literal value, which is discarded when the method is finished. The Number object’s methods provide various display operations, such as providing an exponential notation: var tst = .0004532; alert tst.toExponential   ;    outputs 4.532e-4  55   In addition, there are several static Number properties, which can only be accessed via the Number object directly:  alert Number.MAX_VALUE ;    outputs 1.7976931348623157e+308  There’s a special Number static property, NaN, which is equivalent to the global NaN, and stands for Not a Number. Anytime you try to use a value in a number operation that can’t be parsed as a number, you’ll get a NaN error:  alert parseInt "3.5"  ;    outputs 3 alert parseInt "three point five"  ;    outputs NaN  The Math Object Unlike the Number object, the Math object does not have a constructor. All of the object’s functionality, its properties and methods, are static. If you try to instantiate a Math object:  var newMath = new Math  ;  You’ll get an error. Rather than create a new Math instance, access properties and meth- ods directly on the object instead:  var topValue = Math.max firstValue, secondValue ;    returns larger number  The Math object has a considerable number of properties and methods, including several trigonometric methods. The precision of the methods is at the same level of precision that we would find using a language like C. Table 4-1 provides a listing of the Math properties, and Table 4-2 contains a listing of the Math methods.  Table 4-1. Math object static properties  Property E LN2 LN10 LOG2E LOG10E PI SQRT1_2 SQRT2  Purpose The number value for e, the base of natural logarithms Natural logarithm of 2 Natural logarithm of 10 Base 2 logarithm of e, and the reciprocal of LN2 Base 10 logarithm of e, and the reciprocal of LN10 The number for π Square root of 1 2, reciprocal of SQRT2 Square root of 2  56  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   Table 4-2. Math object static methods  atan2  x, y   Method abs  x   acos  x   asin  x   atan  x   ceil  x   cos  x   exp  x   floor  x   log  x   pow  x,y   random     round  x   sin  x   sqrt  x   max  x1, x2, ..., xn   min  x1, x2, ..., xn   Purpose Returns absolute value of x; if x is NaN, returns NaN Returns arc cosine of x; if x is greater than 1 or less than 0, returns NaN Returns arc sine of x; if x is greater than 1 or less than –1, returns NaN Returns the arc tangent of x Returns the arc tangent of the quotient of x, y Returns the smallest integer equal to or greater than x Returns the cosine of x Returns Ex where E is the base of natural logarithms Returns the largest integer equal to or less than x Returns logarithm of x Returns largest of given arguments Returns smallest of given arguments Returns result of raising x to power of y Returns random number greater than or equal to 0, and less than 1 Rounds number to closest integer Returns the sine of x Returns the square root of x  4.1  Keeping an Incremental Counter Problem You want to maintain an incremental counter in code. Solution Define a number variable, either locally or globally, or as part of an object’s properties, and increment the variable’s value with each iteration of code:  var globalCounter = 0; function nextTest   {    globalCounter++;    ... }  4.1  Keeping an Incremental Counter   57   Discussion The simplest way to increase or decrease a number is using the increment  ++  and  decrement  --  operators, respectively. They’re equivalent to:  numValue = numValue + 1;    equivalent to numValue++ numValue = numValue - 1;    equivalent to numValue--  Both operators can be used prefix or postfix, which means the operators can be placed before or after the operand. How they’re positioned is significant. If the operator is placed before the operand, the operand’s value is adjusted first, before the operand is used:  var numValue = 1; var numValue2 = ++numValue;    numValue and numValue2 are both 2  If the operator is postfix  placed after the operand , the operand is used first, and then its value is adjusted: var numValue = 1; var numValue2 = numValue++;    numValue is 2 and numValue2 is 1  The point at which the counter is incremented depends on its use. If it’s needed in a loop, the value is incremented in the loop:  var counter = 0; while  counter <= 10  {    ...    counter++; }  var counter = 0; function someFunction   {    counter++; }  If the counter is needed more globally, it can be declared as a global variable, but use with caution. A global variable is one that’s declared outside of a function, and isn’t redeclared within a function. It can easily conflict with any other global variables that might exist in the application or other libraries you use:  Another approach is to add the counter as property to an object, persisting as long as the object, and accessible by all object methods. See Also Chapter 16 covers how to create JavaScript objects.  58  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   4.2  Converting a Decimal to a Hexadecimal Value Problem You have a decimal value, and need to find its hexadecimal equivalent. Solution Use the Number object’s toString method:  var num = 255; alert num.toString 16  ;    displays ff, which is hexadecimal equivalent for 255  Discussion By default, numbers in JavaScript are base 10, or decimal. However, they can also be created and used in hexadecimal and octal notation. Hexadecimal numbers begin with 0x  a zero followed by lowercase x , and octal numbers always begin with zero:  var octoNumber = 0255;    equivalent to 173 decimal var hexaNumber = 0xad;    equivalent to 173 decimal  Other base numbers can be created using the Number object’s toString method, passing in the base radix, in a range from 2 to 36:  var decNum = 55; var octNum = decNum.toString 8 ;    value of 67 octal var hexNum = decNum.toString 16 ;    value of 37 hexadecimal var binNum = decNum.toString 2 ;    value of 110111 binary  To complete the octal and hexadecimal presentation, you’ll need to concatenate the zero to the octal, and the 0x to the hexadecimal value. Although decimals can be converted to any base number  between a range of 2 to 36 , only the octal, hexadecimal, and decimal numbers can be manipulated, directly, as numbers. See Also The decimal to hexadecimal conversion is used in Recipe 4.4.  4.3  Creating a Random Number Generator Problem You need to generate a random number, between 0 and 255.  4.3  Creating a Random Number Generator   59   Solution Use  a  combination  of  JavaScript  Math  methods:  random  to  generate  a  random  value between 0 and 1, which is then multiplied by 255, and floor to truncate the number.  var randomNumber = Math.floor Math.random   * 255 ;  Discussion The random method generates a random number between 0 and 1. To increase the range, multiply the result by the upper end of the range of values you want. If you need a random number with a higher lower end, such as a number between 5 and 10, multiply the value from random by a number equal to the upper range, minus the lower range, minus 1, and then add the lower range to the result:  var randomNumber = Math.floor Math.random   * 6  + 5;  The floor method rounds down the floating-point value to the nearest integer.  4.4  Randomly Generating Colors Problem You need to randomly generate a web color. Solution Use the Math object to randomly generate each RGB  Red-Green-Blue  value:  function randomVal val  {   return Math.floor Math.random   * val ; }  function randomColor   {    return "rgb " + randomVal 255  + "," + randomVal 255  + "," + randomVal 255  + " "; }  Discussion Web color can be expressed either in hexadecimal notation, or as an RGB value. With the RGB value, each color is represented as a number between 0 and 255. The example demonstrates one technique to generate a color, using one function to randomly gen- erate the number, and a second to return an RGB formatted string. Older browsers may not support the RGB notation. To use a hexadecimal notation, the randomColor function can be altered to:  function randomColor   {       get red    var r = randomVal 255 .toString 16 ;  60  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math      if  r.length < 2  r= "0" + r;        get green    var g = randomVal 255 .toString 16 ;    if  g.length < 2  g= "0" + g;        get blue    var b = randomVal 255 .toString 16 ;    if  b.length < 2  b= "0" + b;     return "" + r + g + b; }  The hexadecimal notation is used  ffffff , and the generated decimal number is con- verted to hexadecimal notation, using the Number object’s toString method. Since a decimal value of something like zero converts to a single-digit character and the format needs to be double-digit, the length is tested and modified accordingly. All the target browsers support both the RGB and hexadecimal notation, except IE7, which only supports hexadecimal. See Also See Recipe 4.1 about converting between decimal and hexadecimal notation, and Rec- ipe 4.3 for how to randomly generate numbers.  4.5  Converting Strings in a Table to Numbers Problem You want to access values in an HTML table and convert to numbers for processing. Solution Access the numbers using the Document Object Model  DOM  API, and use the global function parseInt to convert the strings to number values:   var rows = document.getElementById "table1" .children[0].rows; var numArray = new Array  ;  for  var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++  {    numArray[numArray.length] = parseInt rows[i].cells[1].firstChild.data ; }  Discussion The parseInt global function has two arguments: a required numeric string, and an optional radix  base . If the radix is not provided, it’s assumed to be 10, for decimal.  4.5  Converting Strings in a Table to Numbers   61   If the string provided doesn’t contain a number, NaN is returned. If the string contains a partial number, the parser will convert the number up to the point where a nonnu- meric value is reached, and return the result:  var numString = "133 hectares"; var numHectares = parseInt numString ;    returns 133  If the number is in floating-point format, parseInt stops when it reaches the decimal, and returns just the integer part of the number. If the string could contain a floating- point number and you want the result to be a floating-point number, use the parse Float global function, instead:  var numString = "1.458 hectares"; var fltNum = parseFloat numString ;    returns 1.458  4.6  Summing All Numbers in a Table Column Problem You want to traverse all of the values in a table column, convert the values to numbers, and then sum the values. Solution Traverse the table column containing numeric values, convert to numbers, and sum the numbers:  var sum = 0;      use querySelector to find all second table cells  var cells = document.querySelectorAll "td:nth-of-type 2 " ;   for  var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++        sum+=parseFloat cells[i].firstChild.data ;  Discussion Both global functions parseInt and parseFloat convert strings to numbers, but parse Float is more adaptable when it comes to handling numbers in an HTML table. Unless you’re absolutely certain all of the numbers will be integers, parseFloat can work with both integers and floating-point numbers. As you traverse the HTML table and convert the table entries to numbers, sum the results. Once you have the sum, you can use it in a database update, print it to the page, or pop up a message box, as the solution demonstrates. You can also add a sum row to the HTML table. Example 4-1 demonstrates how to convert and sum up numeric values in an HTML table, and then how to insert a table row with this sum, at the end. The code uses document.querySelectorAll, which uses  62  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   a CSS selector, td + td. This selector finds all table cells that are preceded by another table cell.  Example 4-1. Converting table values to numbers and summing the results         Accessing numbers in table       <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {     var sum = 0;     var dataTable = document.getElementById "table1" ;        use querySelector to find all second table cells    var cells = document.querySelectorAll "td + td" ;     for  var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++        sum+=parseFloat cells[i].firstChild.data ;        now add sum to end of table    var newRow = document.createElement "tr" ;        first cell    var firstCell = document.createElement "td" ;    var firstCellText = document.createTextNode "Sum:" ;    firstCell.appendChild firstCellText ;    newRow.appendChild firstCell ;        second cell with sum    var secondCell = document.createElement "td" ;    var secondCellText = document.createTextNode sum ;    secondCell.appendChild secondCellText ;    newRow.appendChild secondCell ;        add row to table    dataTable.appendChild newRow ;  }    -->                      Washington  145                   Oregon  233   4.6  Summing All Numbers in a Table Column  63                    Missouri  833              Being able to provide a sum or other operation on table data is helpful if you’re working with dynamic updates via an Ajax operation, such as accessing rows of data from a database. The Ajax operation may not be able to provide summary data, or you may not want to provide summary data until a web page reader chooses to do so. The users may want to manipulate the table results, and then push a button to perform the sum- ming operation. Table rows are simple to add, as long as you remember the steps:  1. Create a new table row using document.createElement "tr" . 2. Create each table row cell using document.createElement "td" . 3. Create each table row cell’s data using document.createTextNode  , passing in the text of the node  including numbers, which are automatically converted to a string .  4. Append the text node to the table cell. 5. Append the table cell to the table row. 6. Append the table row to the table. Rinse, repeat.  If you perform this operation frequently, you’ll most likely want to create functions for these operations, and package them into JavaScript libraries that you can reuse. Also, many of the available JavaScript libraries can do much of this work for you. See Also See more on JavaScript libraries in Chapter 17. View more demonstrations of creating web page components in Chapter 12. The document.querySelectorAll is one of the new Selectors API methods, and won’t work with older browsers. It is not supported in IE7. For new browsers, there may also be restrictions on its use. More examples and dis- cussion of the Selectors API can be found in Recipe 11.4.  4.7  Converting Between Degrees and Radians Problem You have an angle in degrees. To use the value in the Math object’s trigonometric func- tions, you need to convert the degrees to radians.  64  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   Solution To convert degrees to radians, multiply the value by  Math.PI   180 :  var radians = degrees *  Math.PI   180 ;  To convert radians to degrees, multiply the value by  180   Math.PI :  var degrees = radians *  180   Math.PI ;  Discussion All Math trigonometric methods  sin, cos, tin, asin, acos, atan, and atan2 , take values in radians, and return radians as a result. Yet it’s not unusual for people to provide values in degrees rather than radians, as degrees are the more familiar unit of measure. The functionality provided in the solution provides the conversion between the two units.  4.8  Find the Radius and Center of a Circle to Fit Within a Page Element Problem Given the width and height of a page element, you need to find the radius of the largest circle that fits within that page element, and its center point. Solution Find the smaller of the width and height; divide this by 2 to find the radius:  var circleRadius = Math.min elementWidth, elementHeight    2;  Given the page element’s width and height, find the center by dividing both by 2:  var x = elementWidth   2; var y = elementHeight   2;  Discussion Working with graphics requires us to do things such as finding the center of an element, or finding the radius of the largest circle that will fit into a rectangle  or largest rectangle that can fit in a circle . Example 4-2 demonstrates both of the solution calculations, modifying an SVG circle contained within an XHTML document so that the circle fits within the div element that surrounds it.  4.8  Find the Radius and Center of a Circle to Fit Within a Page Element   65   Example 4-2. Fitting a SVG circle into a div element         Using Math method to fit a circle    elem {    width: 400px;    height: 200px;    border: 1px solid 000; }       <![CDATA[  function compStyle elemId,property  {    var elem = document.getElementById elemId ;    var style;    if  window.getComputedStyle       style=window.getComputedStyle elem,null .getPropertyValue property ;    else if  elem.currentStyle        style=elem.currentStyle[property];    return style; } window.onload=function   {   var height = parseInt compStyle "elem","height"  ;   var width = parseInt compStyle "elem","width"  ;    var x = width   2;   var y = height   2;    var circleRadius = Math.min width,height    2;    var circ = document.getElementById "circ" ;   circ.setAttribute "r",circleRadius ;   circ.setAttribute "cx",x ;   circ.setAttribute "cy",y ; }   -->                                   66  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   Figure 4-1 shows the page once it’s loaded. There are techniques in SVG that can ac- complish the same procedure using the SVG element’s viewPort setting, but even with these, at some point in time you’ll need to polish off your basic geometry skills if you want to work with graphics. However, as the example demonstrates, most of the math you’ll need is relatively simple, and basic.  Figure 4-1. Page with SVG circle fit into rectangular div element  See Also Finding a circle’s radius and the center point of an element is important when working with both SVG and Canvas, covered in Chapter 15. The method used to find the com- puted width and height of the div element can be found in Recipe 13.2. Recipe 12.15 covers the setAttribute method. SVG is not supported in IE8 and earlier, but should be supported in IE9.  4.9  Calculating the Length of a Circular Arc Problem Given the radius of a circle, and the angle of an arc in degrees, find the length of the arc.  4.9  Calculating the Length of a Circular Arc   67   Solution Use Math.PI to convert degrees to radians, and use the result in a formula to find the length of the arc:     angle of arc is 120 degrees, radius of circle is 2 var radians = degrees *  Math.PI   180 ; var arclength = radians * radius;    value is 4.18879020478...  Discussion The length of a circular arc is found by multiplying the circle’s radius times the angle of the arc, in radians. If the angle is given in degrees, you’ll need to convert the degree to radians first, before multiplying the angle by the radius. See Also The Math trigonometric methods provide essential functionality for creating various Canvas and SVG effects, discussed in Chapter 15. Recipe 4.7 covers how to convert between degrees and radians.  68  Chapter 4: Working with Numbers and Math   CHAPTER 5 Working with Arrays and Loops  5.0  Introduction An array is an ordered collection of elements. In JavaScript, an array can be created using formal object notation, or it can be initialized using literal notation, as demon- strated in the following code:  var arrObject = new Array "val1", "val2" ;    array as object var arrLiteral = ["val1", "val2"];    array literal  To the developer, there is no difference: you can invoke an Array method on both a literal  and  an  object.  However,  to  the  JavaScript  engine,  an  array  literal  has  to  be reinterpreted each time it’s accessed, especially when used in a function call. On the positive side, though, array literals can replace the need for temporary variables, espe- cially when sending values to a function. A new Array object is created using the new operator, as follows:  var arrObject = new Array  ;  You can also create a new array that has some values:  var arrObject = new Array "val1","val2" ;  You can create an array literal by using square brackets to hold the array values. For instance, you can define an array literal and assign it to a variable:  var arrLiteral = ["val1","val2","val3"];  You can also create, and use, a literal array in a function or method call:  someFunction "param1", ["val1","val2"] ;  Note, though, that when you pass a variable containing an array literal to a function, it  is  passed  by  reference—the  same  as  passing  a  variable  holding  an  Array  object. Changes to the variable in the function are reflected outside of the function:  function chgArray arr  {    arr[0] = "surprise!"; }  69   var newArray = new Array "val1", "val2" ; var newLiteral = ["val1","val2"];  chgArray newArray ; chgArray newLiteral ;  alert newArray ;    prints surprise!,val2 alert newLiteral ;    prints surprise!,val2  An array, whether literal or object, can hold values of different data types:  var arrObject = new Array "val1", 34, true ;    string, number, boolean var arrLiteral = [arrObject, "val2", 18, false ;    object, string, number, boolean  You can print out an array; the JavaScript engine will automatically convert the array into a string representation:  alert arrLiteral ;    prints out val1,34,true,val2,18,false  In this example, the JavaScript engine makes the array-to-string conversion for both the array literal and the array object contained as an element within the array literal. Array elements can be accessed directly, using square brackets containing their index  position in the array . In addition, array elements can be set using the same index, which automatically creates the array element if it doesn’t exist:  var arrObject = new Array  ;  arrObject[0] = "cat";    array now has one element alert arrObject[0] ;    prints cat  Arrays in JavaScript are zero-based, which means the first element index is zero, and the last element is at the array length, minus 1:  var farmAnimals = new Array "cat","dog","horse","pig" ; alert farmAnimals[0] ;    print cat alert farmAnimals[3] ;    print pig  Not all array elements have to be defined when created. For instance, if you create an array literal, you can use commas to delimit array elements that don’t yet exist:  var arrLiteral = ["val1",,"val3"];  In this code, the second array element is currently undefined. You can’t use the empty comma, though, to add an undefined array element to the end of the array: JavaScript will just ignore it. To create an array of several undefined elements, you can provide an array length when creating an array:  var largeCollection = new Array 100 ;    a new array with 100 undefined elements  One you’ve created an array, using Array object or literal notation, you can access the array elements in a loop, or use any number of array methods.  70  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   5.1  Looping Through an Array Problem You want to easily access all elements of an array. Solution The most common approach to accessing an array is to use a for loop:  var mammals = new Array "cat","dog","human","whale","seal" ; var animalString = ""; for  var i = 0; i < mammals. length; i++  {    animalString += mammals[i] + " "; } alert animalString ;  Discussion A for loop can be used to access every element of an array. The array begins at zero, and the array property length is used to set the loop end. Sometimes, though, you don’t want to access every element of the array. For instance, you might want to traverse an array until you find either a specific element, or any element that meets  or doesn’t meet  a certain criteria. In these cases, you’ll want to use a while loop and test the array elements:  var numArray = new Array 1,4,66,123,240,444,555 ; var i = 0;  while  numArray[i] < 100  {      alert numArray[i++] ; }  Notice that the index counter, i, is incremented as it’s used to access an array element. The use of i++ means that the existing value of i is accessed first, and then the variable is incremented.  5.2  Creating a Multidimensional Array Problem You want to create a multidimensional array  an array of arrays . Solution Create an array in which each element is also an array. For example, to create an array with three elements, each of which is also an array of three elements containing, re- spectively, string, number, and array literals, use the code snippet in Example 5-1.  5.2  Creating a Multidimensional Array  71   Example 5-1. Creating a multidimensional array     set array length var arrayLength = 3;     create array var multiArray = new Array arrayLength ; for  var i = 0; i < multiArray.length; i++  {   multiArray[i] = new Array arrayLength ; }     add items to first array index multiArray[0][0] = "apple"; multiArray[0][1] = "banana"; multiArray[0][2] = "cherry";     second multiArray[1][0] = 2; multiArray[1][1] = 56; multiArray[1][2] = 83;     third multiArray[2][0] = ['test','again']; multiArray[2][1] = ['Java','script']; multiArray[2][2] = ['read','books'];  alert multiArray ;    printed out in first index order alert multiArray[2] ;    prints out subarray alert multiArray[2][2][0] ;    individual item Discussion Multidimensional arrays in JavaScript are managed by creating a new array as an ele- ment within an existing array. The new array can be created as an Array element, or as an array literal. In Example 5-1, an array, multiArray, is created as an Array object with three members. Each of those three elements is also created as Array objects with three members. The array data is then set, with the first array member containing string literals, the second containing  number  literals,  and  the  third  array  literals—themselves  containing  two array members, each with a string literal. To access the array elements, use the square bracket notation, with each set of brackets used to address each level of the array. In the following code, the array contents are printed out via an alert window, after being converted to a string first, if necessary:  alert multiArray[2] ;    prints out test,again,Java,script,read,books alert multiArray[2][2] ;    prints out read,books alert multiArray[2][2][1] ;    prints out books  Multidimensional arrays are typically used to hold the data from a table structure, but how the structure is maintained is up to the developer. For instance, the developer can support an array structure in which the outer index reflects the columns, and the inner  72  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   reflects the rows. As an example, Table 5-1 shows a simple five-column, three-row table containing a set of numbers.  Table 5-1. Simple table with five columns and three rows and sample data  45.89 3 1  4 23 1  34 99 0  9998.99 43 43  56 2 67  To create this in JavaScript using a multidimensional array, use the following code:  var table = new Array 5 ;  table[0] = [45.89, 4, 34, 9998.99, 56];    first row table[1] = [3, 23, 99, 43, 2];    second row table[2] = [1, 1, 0, 43, 67];    third row  Of course, this doesn’t take into account column and row headers. To add in the head- ers, just treat them as array data, making sure to incorporate them into the proper place in the array to reflect the table structure.  In a multideveloper environment, it’s essential that there is agreement among  the  developers  about  whether  table  structure  data  is  stored column-centric or row-centric.  5.3  Creating a String from an Array Problem You want to create a single string from an array. Solution Use the Array object’s built-in join method to join the array elements into a string:  var fruitArray = ['apple','peach','lemon','lime']; var resultString = fruitArray.join '-' ;    apple-peach-lemon-lime  Discussion The Array join method takes one optional parameter, a delimiter used to separate the strings when joined—in this case, the dash  - . It returns a string with all of the array elements concatenated. If the array contains anything other than strings, the values are converted to a string equivalent:  var numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5];    array literal containing number elements var resultString = numberArray.join '+' ;    returns string with 1+2+3+4+5  5.3  Creating a String from an Array  73   If the delimiter parameter isn’t provided, a comma is inserted between array element values by default:  var numberArray = [1,2,3,4,5]; var resultString = numberArray.join  ;    returns string with 1,2,3,4,5  5.4  Sorting an Array Problem You want to sort an array. Solution Use the Array object’s sort method:  var fruitArray = ['strawberry','apple','orange','banana','lime']; alert fruitArray.sort   ;    returns apple,banana,lime,orange,strawberry  Discussion The Array object’s sort method sorts the array elements alphabetically if no optional compare function parameter is provided. To facilitate the sort, all data types are con- verted to their string equivalent before sorting:  var numberArray = [4,13,2,31,5]; alert numberArray.sort   ;    returns  13,2,31,4,5  Though the array members in this example are numbers, they’re sorted in lexicograph- ical  dictionary  order, not numerically. To do an actual numeric sort, use a custom sort function:  function compareNumbers a,b  {    return a - b; } var numArray = [13,2,31,4,5]; alert numArray.sort compareNumbers  ;    prints 2,4,5,13,31  The function subtracts the second parameter value from the first, and if the first is less than the second, a negative value is returned; otherwise, the value is positive. If the return value is less than zero, the sort index for the second parameter is set higher than the first parameter. If the value is greater than zero, the sort index for the first parameter is set higher than the other. If the value is exactly zero, the sort index for the two is unchanged. If  the  array  elements  contain  strings  that  could  be  converted  to  numbers,  then  the compareNumbers sort function still works, as number conversion is automatic:  var numberArray=["34","4","5"]; alert numberArray.sort compareNumbers  ;    prints 4,5,34  74  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   The sort method sorts the elements in an ascending order. If you want to do a reverse sort, use the sort method to sort the elements, and then use the reverse method to reverse the array member order: var numberArray = [4,5,1,3,2]; numberArray.sort  ; numberArray.reverse  ;    array now has 5,4,3,2,1  5.5  Store and Access Values in Order Problem You want to store values in such a way that you can access the values in the order in which they were stored. Solution To store and access values in the order in which they’re received, create a FIFO  first- in, first-out  queue. Use the JavaScript Array object push method to add items to the queue, and shift to retrieve:     create new array var queue = new Array  ;     push on three entries queue.push 'first' ; queue.push 'second' ; queue.push 'third' ;     shift two entries alert queue.shift   ;     returns first alert queue.shift   ;     returns second alert queue ;     returns third  Discussion A queue is an array of elements that are added one at a time, and retrieved in a first-in, first-out order  FIFO . Think of a line at the bank: people go to the end when they arrive at the bank, and tellers help those in the front of the line, who have been there the longest. You could emulate this behavior using counter variables to hold the index of the last item added  the end , and the index of the last one retrieved  from the front , but luckily, the JavaScript Array object provides methods that handle this information for us, and also keep the array clean in the process. The Array push method creates a new array element and adds it to the end of the array:  queue.push 'first' ;  The array element count increments with each pushed element.  5.5  Store and Access Values in Order   75   The Array shift method extracts the array element from the front of the array, remov- ing it from the array, and returning the element:  var elem = queue.shift  ;  The array element count decreases by one with each shifted element, as  shift also modifies the array in addition to returning the item.  5.6  Store and Access Values in Reverse Order Problem You want to store values in such a way that you can access the values in reverse order: access the most recently stored value first, then a LIFO  last-in, first-out  stack. Solution To access stored values in reverse order  last item added is accessed first , create a LIFO  last-in, first-out  stack. Use the JavaScript Array object’s push method to add items to the stack, and the pop method to retrieve:     create new array var queue = new Array  ;     push on three entries queue.push 'first' ; queue.push 'second' ; queue.push 'third' ;     pop two entries alert queue.pop   ;     returns third alert queue.pop   ;     returns second alert queue ;    returns first  Discussion A stack is an array of elements, with each new element added to the top of the stack, and retrieved in a last-in, first-out  LIFO  order. Think of a stack of dishes: you add plates to the top as they’re washed, and retrieve them from the top when needed. You could use a variable holding an integer that tracks the end of the array after each addition and retrieval, but JavaScript provides the functionality we need. The Array push method creates a new array element and adds it to the end of the array:  queue.push 'first' ;  The array element count increments with each pushed element. The Array pop method extracts the array element from the end of the array, removing it from the array, and returning the element:  var elem = queue.pop  ;  76  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   The array element count decreases by one with each popped element, as pop modifies the array.  5.7  Create a New Array as a Subset of an Existing Array Problem You want to create a new array from a segment of an existing array. If the array elements are objects, you want to keep both arrays in sync. Solution Use the Array object slice method to create a new array based on elements within a given range:  var origArray = new Array 4 ; origArray[0] = new Array "one","two" ; origArray[1] = new Array "three","four" ; origArray[2] = new Array "five","six" ; origArray[3] = new Array "seven","eight" ;     create new array using slice var newArray = origArray.slice 1,3 ;  Discussion The Array slice method is a simple way of building a new array from a consecutive sequence of elements in another array. The parameters are the beginning and ending index for the sequence of elements to copy. A negative value for either index indicates that slice should work from the end of the array. If the copied elements are literal values, such as strings, numbers, and Booleans, they’re copied by value—changing the value in the old array has no impact on the same values in the new array, and vice versa. When objects are copied, though, they’re copied by reference, whether they’re copied via slice or by direct variable assignment:  var first = new Array "one","two","three" ; var second = first;    copied by reference second[1] = "apple";    first and second arrays now have "one","apple","three"  The code that follows demonstrates the object syncing when used with slice. A section of one array is used to create a new array with slice. The elements in the first array are Array objects. In the code, when the value of one of the objects in the first array is changed, the change is reflected in the new array. Conversely, when a value is changed in the new array, the change is reflected in the original array:  var origArray = new Array 4 ; origArray[0] = new Array "one","two" ;  5.7  Create a New Array as a Subset of an Existing Array  77   origArray[1] = new Array "three","four" ; origArray[2] = new Array "five","six" ; origArray[3] = new Array "seven","eight" ;  var newArray = origArray.slice 1,3 ; alert newArray ;    prints out three,four,five,six     modify original origArray[1][0] = "octopus";     print out new alert newArray ;    prints out octopus,four,five,six     modify new newArray[1][1] = "kitten";     print out old alert origArray ;    prints out one,two,octopus,four,five,kitten,seven,eight  Another handy use for slice is to convert the function arguments property into a proper array:  var args = Array.prototype.slice.call arguments ;  Using slice to create a subset of an array is a way of quickly copying a subset of an array and, if the values are objects, ensure both arrays are in sync. Be aware, though, that IE8 doesn’t support slice.  5.8  Searching Through an Array Problem You want to search an array for a specific value and get the array element index if found. Solution Use the new  ECMAScript 5  Array object methods indexOf and lastIndexOf:  var animals = new Array "dog","cat","seal","elephant","walrus","lion" ; alert animals.indexOf "elephant"  ;    prints 3  Discussion Though support for both indexOf and lastIndexOf has existed in browsers for some time, it’s only been formalized with the release of ECMAScript 5. Both methods take a search value, which is then compared to every element in the array. If the value is found, both return an index representing the array element. If the value is not found, –1 is returned. The indexOf method returns the first one found, the lastIndexOf returns the last one found:  var animals = new Array "dog","cat","seal","walrus","lion", "cat" ;  78  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   alert animals.indexOf "cat"  ;    prints 1 alert animals.lastIndexOf "cat"  ;    prints 5  Both methods can take a starting index, setting where the search is going to start:  var animals = new Array "dog","cat","seal","walrus","lion", "cat" ;  alert animals.indexOf "cat",2  ;    prints 5 alert animals.lastIndexOf "cat",4  ;    prints 1  Currently, all of the book’s target browsers support indexOf and lastIndexOf, except for IE8. See Also As  mentioned,  not  all  browsers  support  indexof  and  lastIndexOf.  A  cross-browser method to implement like functionality in these browsers is given in the Mozilla doc- umentation, at https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference Global _Objects Array indexOf. Since IE8 doesn’t support indexOf, here’s the Mozilla work- around for the function:  if  !Array.prototype.indexOf  {   Array.prototype.indexOf = function elt  *, from*     {     var len = this.length >>> 0;      var from = Number arguments[1]   0;     from =  from < 0           ? Math.ceil from           : Math.floor from ;     if  from < 0        from += len;      for  ; from < len; from++      {       if  from in this &&           this[from] === elt          return from;     }     return -1;   }; }  5.9  Flatten a Multidimensional Array Problem You want to flatten a multidimensional array into a single dimensional array.  5.9  Flatten a Multidimensional Array  79   Solution Use the Array object concat method to merge the array dimensions into a single di- mensional array:  var origArray = new Array  ; origArray[0] = new Array "one","two" ; origArray[1] = new Array "three","four" ; origArray[2] = new Array "five","six" ; origArray[3] = new Array "seven","eight" ;     flatten array var newArray = origArray[0].concat origArray[1],origArray[2],origArray[3] ; alert newArray[5] ;    prints six  Discussion The Array object concat method takes one or more arrays, and appends the array ele- ments on to the end of the contents of the parent array on which the method was called. The merged array is then returned as a new array. One use for this type of functionality is to return a single dimensional array made up of elements from a multidimensional array, as shown in the solution.  5.10  Search and Remove or Replace Array Elements Problem You want to find occurrences of a given value in an array, and either remove the element or replace with another value. Solution Use the Array methods indexOf and splice to find and remove replace array elements:  var animals = new Array "dog","cat","seal","walrus","lion", "cat" ;     remove the element from array animals.splice animals.indexOf "walrus" ,1 ;    dog,cat,seal,lion,cat     splice in new element animals.splice animals.lastIndexOf "cat" ,1,"monkey" ;    dog,cat,seal,lion,monkey  Discussion The splice method takes three parameters. The first parameter is required; it’s the index where the splicing is to take place. The other two parameters are optional: the number of elements to remove, and a substitute. If the index is negative, the elements will be spliced from the end, not from the beginning of the array:  80  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   var animals = new Array "cat","walrus","lion", "cat" ;     splice in new element animals.splice -1,1,"monkey" ;    cat,walrus,lion,monkey  If the number of elements to splice is not provided, all elements from the index to the end will be removed:  var animals = new Array "cat","walrus","lion", "cat" ;     remove all elements after second animals.splice 2 ;    cat,walrus  The last parameter, the replaced value, can be a set of replacement values, separated by commas:  var animals = new Array "cat","walrus","lion", "cat" ;     replace second element with two animals.splice 2,1,"zebra","elephant" ;    cat,walrus,zebra,elephant,cat  Removing or replacing one element is handy, but being able to remove or replace all instances of a particular element is even handier. In Example 5-2, an array is created with  several  elements,  including  multiple  instances  of  a  specific  value.  The  splice method is then used in a loop to replace all of the elements with this one value with elements with a new value. The splice method is used again, in a separate loop, to remove the newly spliced elements.  Example 5-2. Using looping and splice to replace and remove elements       Looping and Splicing       var charSets = new Array "ab","bb","cd","ab","cc","ab","dd","ab" ;     replace element while  charSets.indexOf "ab"  != -1  {    charSets.splice charSets.indexOf "ab" ,1,"**" ; } alert charSets ;    **,bb,cd,**,cc,dd,**     delete new element while charSets.indexOf "**"  != -1  {    charSets.splice charSets.indexOf "**" ,1 ; } alert charSets ;    bb,cd,cc,dd            5.10  Search and Remove or Replace Array Elements   81   The example works with all of this book’s target browsers except for IE8, which doesn’t currently support either indexOf or splice. See Also See Recipe 5.8 for a workaround for indexOf.  5.11  Applying a Function Against Each Array Element Problem You want to use a function to check an array value, and replace it if it matches a given criterion. Solution Use the new ECMAScript 5 Array object forEach to attach a callback function to each array element:  var charSets = new Array "ab","bb","cd","ab","cc","ab","dd","ab" ;  function replaceElement element,index,array  {    if  element == "ab"  array[index] = "**";  }     apply function to each array element charSets.forEach replaceElement ; alert charSets ;    prints **,bb,cd,**,cc,**,dd,**  Discussion In the last section, we used a while loop to traverse an array to find and replace a value, but how much more helpful is it to use the forEach method? The forEach method takes one parameter, the function. The function itself has three parameters: the array element, the index of the element, and the array. All three were used in the function, replaceElement. First, the element’s value is tested to see if it matches a given string, ab. If matched, the array element’s index is used to modify the array element’s value with the replacement string, **.  Don’t return a value from the function passed to the forEach method, as the value will be discarded.  Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari support forEach, but IE8 does not.  82  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   See Also The concept of callback functions is covered in more detail in Chapter 6. Most modern browsers support forEach. However, for those that don’t, you can em- ulate the forEach behavior using the Array.prototype property. Mozilla provides a de- scription about how to emulate forEach at https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core_Java Script_1.5_Reference Global_Objects Array forEach.  For  completeness,  I’ve  duplica- ted the code below. To use, add the code into a library function and make sure it’s processed before the forEach method is needed:  if  !Array.prototype.forEach  {   Array.prototype.forEach = function fun  *, thisp*     {     var len = this.length >>> 0;     if  typeof fun != "function"        throw new TypeError  ;      var thisp = arguments[1];     for  var i = 0; i < len; i++      {       if  i in this          fun.call thisp, this[i], i, this ;     }   }; }  5.12  Applying a Function to Every Element in an Array and Returning a New Array Problem You want to convert an array of decimal numbers into a new array with their hexa- decimal equivalents. Solution Use the Array object map method to create a new array consisting of elements from the old array that have been modified via a callback function passed to the map method:     function to convert decimal to hexadecimal function convertToHex element,index,array  {    return element.toString 16 ; }  var decArray = new Array 23, 255, 122, 5, 16, 99 ;  var hexArray = decArray.map convertToHex ; alert hexArray ;    17,ff,a,5,10,63  5.12  Applying a Function to Every Element in an Array and Returning a New Array  83   Discussion Like the forEach method in Recipe 5.11, the ECMAScript 5 map method allows us to attach a callback function that is applied to each array element. Unlike forEach, though, the map method results in a new array rather than modifying the original array. There- fore, you won’t return a value when using forEach, but you must return a value when using map. The function that’s passed to the map method has three parameters: the current array element, the index for the array element, and the array. The forEach and map methods are currently not supported by IE8. See Also Most modern browsers support the Array object map method, but to ensure that the functionality is present, you can use the Array.prototype property to emulate the meth- od’s behavior. See how at the Mozilla website. For comprehensiveness, I’ve included the code for the workaround below. To use, include the code in a library function that is processed before the map method is needed:  if  !Array.prototype.map  {   Array.prototype.map = function fun  *, thisp*     {     var len = this.length >>> 0;     if  typeof fun != "function"        throw new TypeError  ;      var res = new Array len ;     var thisp = arguments[1];     for  var i = 0; i < len; i++      {       if  i in this          res[i] = fun.call thisp, this[i], i, this ;     }      return res;   }; }  5.13  Creating a Filtered Array Problem You want to filter element values in an array and assign the results to a new array. Solution Use the Array object filter method:  84  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   function removeChars element,index,array  {    return  element !== "**" ; }  var charSet = new Array "**","bb","cd","**","cc","**","dd","**" ;  var newArray = charSet.filter removeChars ; alert newArray ;    bb,cd,cc,dd  Discussion The filter method is another ECMAScript 5 addition, like forEach and map, covered in Recipes 5.11 and 5.12, respectively. Like them, the method is a way of applying a callback function to every array element. The function passed as parameter to the filter method returns a Boolean value, true or false, based on some test against the array elements. This returned value determines if the array element is added to a new array: it is added if the function returns true; otherwise, it is not added. In the solution, the character string “**” is filtered from the original array when the new array is created. The function has three parameters: the array element, the index for the element, and the array, itself. The filter method is not supported by IE8. See Also Support for filter is fairly broad, but to ensure access to the functionality, there is a way to emulate the filter method using Array.prototype. Mozilla details the approach at  https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference Global_Objects Ar ray filter, but I’ve copied the technique below. To use, include the function in your code, and run the function before you need to access the filter method:  if  !Array.prototype.filter  {   Array.prototype.filter = function fun  *, thisp*     {     var len = this.length >>> 0;     if  typeof fun != "function"        throw new TypeError  ;      var res = new Array  ;     var thisp = arguments[1];     for  var i = 0; i < len; i++      {       if  i in this        {         var val = this[i];    in case fun mutates this         if  fun.call thisp, val, i, this             res.push val ;       }     }  5.13  Creating a Filtered Array  85       return res;   }; }  5.14  Validating Array Contents Problem You want to ensure that an array meets certain criteria. Solution Use the Array object’s every method to check that every element passes a given criteria. For instance, the following code checks to ensure that every element in the array is an alphanumeric character:  var elemSet = new Array "**",123,"aaa","abc","-",46,"AAA" ;  Or use the Array object’s some method to ensure that at least some of the elements pass the criteria. As an example, the following code checks to ensure that at least some of the array elements are alphanumeric strings:  var elemSet = new Array "**",123,"aaa","abc","-",46,"AAA" ;     testing function function textValue  element,index,array  {    var textExp =  ^[a-zA-Z]+$ ;    return textExp.test element ; }     run test alert elemSet.every textValue  ;    false     testing function function textValue  element,index,array  {    var textExp =  ^[a-zA-Z]+$ ;    return textExp.test element ; }     run test alert elemSet.some textValue  ;    true  Discussion The  every  and  some  Array  object  methods  are  the  last  of  the  ECMAScript  5  Array methods I’ll be covering in this book. Unlike the Array callback function methods I covered in previous recipes in this chapter, every and some functions do not work against all array elements; they only process as many array elements as necessary to fulfill their functionality.  86  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   The solution demonstrates that the same callback function can be used for both the every and the some Array object methods. The difference is that when using the every method, as soon as the function returns a false value, the processing is finished, and the method returns false. The some method, though, will continue to test against every array element until the callback function returns true. At that time, no other elements are  validated,  and  the  method  returns  true.  However,  if  the  callback  function  tests against all elements, and doesn’t return true at any point, the some method returns false. Which method to use depends on your needs. If all array elements must meet certain criteria, then use every; otherwise, use some. The callback function takes three parameters: the element, the index for the element, and the array. Neither the some or every method are supported by IE8, but they are supported by the other target browsers for this book. See Also Most modern browsers support every and some, but for those browsers that don’t  such as  most  versions  of  Internet  Explorer ,  you  can  emulate  the  behavior  using  the Array.prototype. Mozilla covers how to do this at https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core _JavaScript_1.5_Reference Global_Objects Array some  and  https:  developer.mozilla .org en Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference Global_Objects Array every. For comprehensiveness, I’ve also included the functionality below. To use, ensure that the script provided is processed before the methods are needed. Here’s how to emulate some: if  !Array.prototype.some  {   Array.prototype.some = function fun  *, thisp*     {     var i = 0,         len = this.length >>> 0;      if  typeof fun != "function"        throw new TypeError  ;      var thisp = arguments[1];     for  ; i < len; i++      {       if  i in this &&           fun.call thisp, this[i], i, this           return true;     }      return false;   }; }  Here’s how to emulate every:  5.14  Validating Array Contents   87   if  !Array.prototype.every  {   Array.prototype.every = function fun  *, thisp*     {     var len = this.length >>> 0;     if  typeof fun != "function"        throw new TypeError  ;      var thisp = arguments[1];     for  var i = 0; i < len; i++      {       if  i in this &&           !fun.call thisp, this[i], i, this           return false;     }      return true;   }; }  5.15  Using an Associative Array to Store Form Element Names and Values Problem You want to store form element names and values, for later validation purposes. Solution Use an associative array to store the elements, using the element identifiers as array index:  var elemArray = new Object  ;    notice Object, no Array var elem = document.forms[0].elements[0]; elemArray[elem.id] = elem.value;  Iterate over the array using the for...in statement:  for  var key in elemArray  {   str+=key + "," + elemArray[key] + " "; }  Discussion Most JavaScript arrays use a numeric index, such as the following:  arr[0] = value;  88  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   However, you can create an associative array in JavaScript, where the array index can be a string representing a keyword, mapping that string to a given value. In the solution, the array index is the identifier given the array element, and the actual array value is the form element value. You can create an associative array, but you’re not using the Array object to do so. Using the Array object is risky and actively discouraged—especially if you’re using one of the built-in libraries that use the prototype attribute for extending objects, as people dis- covered when the popular Prototype.js library was first released several years ago. The earlier Prototype.js library made an assumption that most array use in JavaScript is numeric index–based, like most of the earlier examples in this chapter. The library extended the Array object functionality via Array.prototype, based on this assumption. But extending Array objects in this way breaks the for...in loop functionality used to traverse an associative array created from an Array object. It’s not that Prototype.js was “breaking” JavaScript. The for...in loop was intended for one purpose: iterating over an object’s properties, such as being able to loop through the String object’s properties, or your own custom object properties. When we use an Array object to create an associative array, what we’re really doing is adding new properties to the array object, rather than adding new array elements. You could actually create an associative array with a RegExp or String, as well as an Array. The reason is that in JavaScript objects are associative arrays. When you’re adding a new array, element:  obj[propName] = "somevalue";  what you’re really doing is adding a new object property:  obj.propName = "somevalue";  To further demonstrate how different the associative array is from a numeric-based array, when you use an Array to create an associative array, you can’t access the array “elements” by index, and the length property returns zero. Instead  of  using  an  Array  object  to  create  the  associative  array,  use  the  JavaScript Object directly. You get the exact same functionality, but avoid the clashes with libraries that extend the base Array object using prototype. Example 5-3 shows a web page. Here, when the form is submitted, all of the form elements of type text are accessed and stored in an associative array. The element IDs are used as the array keyword, and the values assigned to the array elements. Once collected,  the  associative  array  is  passed  to  another  function  that  could  be  used  to validate the values, but in this case just creates a string of keyword value pairs, which is then displayed.  5.15  Using an Associative Array to Store Form Element Names and Values   89   Example 5-3. Demonstrating associative array with form elements         Associative Array      <![CDATA[     get the form element names and values function getVals   {   var elems = document.getElementById "picker" .elements;   var elemArray = new Object  ;   for  var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++  {     if  elems[i].type == "text"         elemArray[elems[i].id] = elems[i].value;   }   checkVals elemArray ;   return false; }     check values function checkVals elemArray  {    var str = "";   for  var key in elemArray  {     str+=key + "," + elemArray[key] + " ";   }   document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = str; }    -->           Value 1:      Value 2:      Value 3:      Value 4:                 In the example, notice that the array index is formed by the form element’s id. When the array is traversed, the for loop syntax used is:  for  keyword in array   90  Chapter 5: Working with Arrays and Loops   This syntax accesses the array index, which is then assigned to the keyword variable that can be used to access the array value:  for  keyword in array     var a = array[keyword];  Figure 5-1 shows the example after values are typed into the form fields and the form is submitted.  Figure 5-1. Demonstration of associative array and traversing form elements  This type of keyword value pairing is commonly referred to as a hash map or hash table, though the JavaScript functionality isn’t a true hash map functionality. The rea- son why it isn’t a true hash map is that it doesn’t account for the fact that the same keyword could be used with multiple values, and the JavaScript version only accepts strings as keywords. See Also See Chapter 16 for more on the object nature of JavaScript, and Recipe 16.3 for more information about extending the built-in objects, such as Array, using the prototype property. For more on the risks associated with associative arrays in JavaScript, read “JavaScript ‘Associative Arrays’ Considered Harmful”, by Andrew Dupont.  5.15  Using an Associative Array to Store Form Element Names and Values   91    CHAPTER 6 Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions  6.0  Introduction JavaScript functions provide a way to encapsulate a block of code in order to reuse the code several times. They’re typically created using the function statement and syntax similar to the following:  function functionname arg1, arg2, ..., argn  {    function body }  JavaScript functions have Function objects, which can be constructed the same as a String or Number, using the new operator:  var fn = new Function  arg1, arg2, ..., argn, functionbody ;  However, using this syntax is not as efficient as using the function statement, because using a function constructor requires that the function be parsed each time it’s called. Functions  defined  with  the  function  statement  are  parsed  once,  when  the  code  is loaded. There are three basic kinds of functions:  Declarative function  A declarative function is a statement triggered by the use of the function keyword, and parsed when the JavaScript application is first loaded.  Anonymous function or function constructor  An anonymous function is constructed using the new operator and referencing the Function object. It’s anonymous because it isn’t given a name, and access to the function occurs through a variable or another object property. It’s parsed each time it’s accessed.  93   Function literal or function expression  As with other JavaScript objects, functions can be both object and literal. A literal function is a function expression, including parameter and body, which is used in place—such as in an argument to another function. Like a declarative function, it’s  also  parsed  only  once,  when  the  JavaScript  application  is  loaded.  Like  the function created as an object, it can also be anonymous.  6.1  Creating a Block of Reusable Code Problem You want to create a block of code that you can use several times. Solution Create a simple, named, parameter-less function using the function statement:  function simpleFunction   {    alert "Hello, function!" ; };  simpleFunction  ;  function functionName   {       JavaScript statements }  Discussion A function created using the function keyword and given a name is known as both a declarative function and a static function. The basic structure is:  This type of function is parsed when the page containing the JavaScript application is loaded, and the parsed results are used whenever the function name is referenced. It’s an efficient way of reusing the same code. Any name that would be valid for a variable would work for a function. Variable names can be any combination of characters, numbers, and underscores, as long as the variable name starts with a character or underscore and case-sensitivity is preserved. However, functions typically perform some action, and best practices suggest that the function name should be descriptive. For instance, a function that sums the numbers in an HTML table might be named sumTableValues.  94  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   6.2  Passing Single Data Values to and from a Function Problem You need to pass data values into a named function and get a result back. Solution Provide arguments for the incoming data, and return the result:  function makeHello strName  {    return  "Hello " + strName ; }  window.onload=function   {    var name = prompt "What's your name?","" ;    var greeting = makeHello name ;    alert greeting ; }  Discussion Function arguments are a way to pass data to a function. The arguments are separated by commas and included in the parentheses following the function name:  var firstName = "Shelley": var lastName = "Powers";  makeHello firstName, lastName ;  The function then processes the arguments, as needed:  function makeHello firstName, lastName  {     alert "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName ; }  function makeHello firstName, lastName  {    return "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName; }  Data is returned from the function to the calling program using the return statement:  You can pass several arguments to the function, but only one return value. If you want to return more than one value, you can pass more complex objects, such as an array, to and from a function. Unless you’re sure about the type of data coming from the user, you’ll want to also test the data first. For instance, if you want to ensure that a value passed to the function is a number, you could do the following:  function someFunc num  {    if  typeof num == "number"  {       ...    } }  6.2  Passing Single Data Values to and from a Function  95   You also don’t have to provide a one-to-one mapping between the value passed to the object, and the number of function parameters. Every function has an arguments object which contains all of the arguments passed to the function. It’s not a true function, but you can use array index notation to access the argument, and it does provide a length property for the number of arguments:  function sumNums   {   var sum = 0;   for  var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++  {      var num = parseFloat arguments[i] ;      if  !isNaN num   {         sum+=num;      }    }    return sum; } ... var sum = sumNums 4.55, 3.0,1, "apple", 56.33 ;  See Also Recipe 6.3 demonstrates passing more complex objects as arguments.  6.3  Passing Complex Data Objects to a Function Problem You need to pass more complex data to a function. Solution You can use objects, such as arrays, as function arguments:  function makeHello name  {    name[name.length] = "Hello " + name[0] + " " + name[1]; } var name = new Array 'Ima','Reader' ; makeHello name ; alert name[2] ;    displays "Hello Ima Reader"  Discussion Function arguments in JavaScript can be scalar values, such as a string or number, or complex objects, such as arrays. Arrays are a simple way to pass many values to a function without having to create separate parameters for each. It’s also a way to pass an unknown number of values to a function, such as an array of numbers to be summed:  function addNumbers nums  {    var total = 0;    for  var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++  {       total+=nums[i];  96  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions      }    return total; }  A complex object is treated differently than a scalar argument in a function. In the solution, an array is passed to the makeHello function, but isn’t returned from the func- tion. However, the generated value added to the array in the function is still accessible to the calling program, because objects are passed into functions by reference. Scalar arguments are passed by value, which means that a copy of the argument is made for processing in the function and changes to the argument in the function won’t be reflected back to the calling program. Objects, though, are passed by reference: any changes to them in the function are reflected in the calling program. Example 6-1 demonstrates the differences between scalar and complex objects when used as function arguments. The function takes two parameters, a string literal and an array. Both are modified in the function, and the contents of both are printed after the function returns control to the calling program.  Example 6-1. Functional differences between scalar and array arguments         Function test      <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {   var items = new Array 'apple','orange','cherry','lime' ;   var sep = '*';   concatenateString items,sep ;    alert items ;   alert sep ; }  function concatenateString strings, separator  {   var result="";   for  var i = 0; i < strings.length; i++  {     result+=strings[i] + separator;   }       assign result to separator   separator = result;       and array   strings[strings.length]=result; }    -->       6.3  Passing Complex Data Objects to a Function  97          The array reflects the change that occurred in the function:  apple,orange,cherry,lime,apple*orange*cherry*lime*  While the string argument does not reflect the change, and consists only of the asterisk separator string  * .  6.4  Creating a Dynamic Runtime Function Problem You need to create a function, but you won’t know its structure until runtime. Solution Use an anonymous function, created using the Function object constructor:     two parameters and one function body string var functionName = new Function  x, y, functionBody ; functionName varA, varB ;    two parameters are processed by function  Discussion Functions  created  using  the  new  Function  object  constructor  are  called  anonymous functions because they’re not given a function name when they’re created. Instead, they’re assigned to a variable. You then use the variable as you would a function call. Anonymous functions are parsed at runtime, which makes them inefficient for general purposes.  However,  they  allow  us  to  define  both  parameters  and  function  body  at runtime, which is handy if you’re not sure what the function body is going to be until runtime. To demonstrate an anonymous function, I’m going to borrow an example from another of my books, Learning JavaScript  O’Reilly , replicated in Example 6-2. This JavaScript application prompts the web page reader to provide a function that takes two param- eters, as well as the value of the parameters. The application then uses these values to create the function and invoke it.  Example 6-2. Using an anonymous function         Anonymous Function      <![CDATA[  98  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   window.onload=function   {    var func = prompt "Enter function body:","" ;   var x = prompt "Enter value for x:","" ;   var y = prompt "Enter value for y:","" ;    var newFun = new Function "x","y",func ;   var result = newFun x,y ;  }    -->             When prompted for the function body, use something simple such as this  shown in Figure 6-1 :  alert x + " " + y   If you pass in Hello and World for the next two prompts, the result is an alert message with “Hello World”.  Figure 6-1. Entering function body for anonymous function  The function return value is assigned a variable, just in case the dynamic function body returns a value. If no value is returned, then the returned value is undefined. Of course, using an anonymous function like this isn’t the safest thing to do, because you can’t control what the person enters as function body. And it’s not particularly useful either.  6.4  Creating a Dynamic Runtime Function  99   Anonymous functions can be useful when passing functions as arguments, or assigning them to object properties. However, in most of these cases a literal function is preferred over a function object, because function literals are parsed once, when the application is loaded. See Also Literal functions are covered in Recipe 6.5.  6.5  Passing a Function As an Argument to Another Function Problem You want to pass a function as an argument to another function. Solution For the following function:  function otherFunction x,y,z  {   x y,z ; }  use a literal function:  var param = function arg1, arg2  { alert arg1 + " " + arg2 ; }; otherFunction param, "Hello", "World" ;  or a function expression as a function argument:  otherFunction function arg1,arg2  { alert arg1 + ' ' + arg2 ; }, "Hello","World" ;  Discussion The function keyword is an operator as well as a statement, and can be used to create a  function  as  an  expression.  Functions  created  this  way  are  called  function  expres- sions, function literals, and anonymous functions, though “anonymous functions” is an overloaded  term  since  it  applies  to  functions  as  objects,  as  well  as  functions  as expressions. A function name can be provided with literal functions, but it’s only accessible within the function:  var param = function inner   { return typeof inner; } alert param   ;    prints out "function"  This functionality may not seem useful, but it’s essential if you want to implement recursion.  100  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   You can pass a function as an argument to another function as a named variable, or even  directly  within  the  argument  list,  as  shown  in  the  solution.  Unlike  functions constructed as objects, function literals are parsed when the page is loaded, rather than each time they’re accessed. See Also See Recipe 6.6 for a demonstration of using a named function literal in recursion.  6.6  Implementing a Recursive Algorithm Problem You want to implement a function that will recursively traverse an array and return a reversed array string. Solution Use a function literal recursively until the end goal is met:   var reverseArray = function x,indx,str  {    return indx == 0 ? str : reverseArray x,--indx, str+= " " + x[indx]  ;; }   var arr = new Array 'apple','orange','peach','lime' ;  var str = reverseArray arr,arr.length,"" ;  alert str ;   var arr2 = ['car','boat','sun','computer'];  str = reverseArray arr2,arr2.length,"" ;  alert str ;  Discussion Before looking at the solution, I want to cover the concept of recursion first, and the look at functional recursion. Recursion is a well-known concept in the field of mathematics, as well as computer science. An example of recursion in mathematics is the Fibonacci Sequence:  fn = fn-1 + fn-2, for n= 2,3,4,...,n and f0 = 0 and f1 = 1  A Fibonacci number is the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers. Another  example  of  mathematical  recursion  is  a  factorial,  usually  denoted  with  an exclamation point  4! . A factorial is the product of all integers from 1 to a given number n. If n is 4, then the factorial  4!  would be:  24 = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4  6.6  Implementing a Recursive Algorithm  101   These recursions can be coded in JavaScript using functional recursion. A common example of JavaScript recursion is the solution for a Fibonacci:  var fibonacci = function  n  {    return n < 2 ? n : fibonacci n - 1  + fibonacci n - 2 ; }  or a factorial:  function Factorial n  {    return n == 1 ? 1 : n * Factorial n -1 ; } var val = Factorial 4 ;  In the Fibonacci example, n is tested to see if it is less than 2. If it is, the value of n  2  is returned; otherwise the Fibonacci function is called again with  n – 1  and with  n – 2 , and the sum of both is returned. A little convoluted? The second example with the Factorial might be clearer. In this example, when the function is first called, the value passed as argument is compared to the number 1. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function terminates, returning 1. However, if n is greater than 1, what’s returned is the value of n times a call to the Factorial function again, this time passing in a value of n – 1. The value of n, then, decreases with each iteration of the function, until the terminating condition  or base  is reached. What happens is that the interim values of the function call are pushed onto a stack in memory and kept until the termination condition is met. Then the values are popped from memory and returned, in a state similar to the following:  return 1; return 1; return 1 * 2; return 1 * 2 * 3; return 1 * 2 * 3 * 4;     0!    1!    2!    3!    4!  In  the  solution,  we  reverse  the  array  elements  by  using  a  recursive  function  literal. Instead of beginning at index zero, we begin the array from the end length, and decre- ment this value with each iteration. When the value is zero, we return the string. If we want the reverse, to concatenate the array elements, in order, to a string, we modify the function:   var orderArray = function x,indx,str  {   return indx == x.length-1 ? str : orderArray x,++indx, str+=x[indx] + " "  ; }  var arr = new Array 'apple','orange','peach','lime' ; var str = orderArray arr,-1,"" ;  102  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   Rather than the length of the array, we start with an index value of –1, and continue the loop until one less than the length of the array. We increment the index value, rather than decrement with each loop. Most recursive functions can be replaced with code that performs the same function linearly, via some kind of loop. The advantage of recursion is that recursive functions can be fast, and efficient. The downside, though, is that recursive functions can be very memory-intensive. See Also Some of the negative consequences of recursive functions can be mitigated via memo- ization, covered in Recipe 6.9. Accessing the outer variable internally with the recursive function is covered in Recipe 6.7, which goes into function scope.  6.7  Create a Function That Remembers Its State Problem You want to create a function that can remember static data, but without having to use global variables and without resending the same data with each function call. Solution Create an outer function that takes one or more parameters, and then an inner function that also takes one or more parameters but uses both its and its parent function’s pa- rameters in order to perform its functionality. Return the inner function from the outer function, and assign it to a variable. From that point, use the variable as a function:  function greetingMaker greeting  {    function addName name  {       return greeting + " " + name;    }    return addName; }     Now, create new partial functions var daytimeGreeting = greetingMaker "Good Day to you" ; var nightGreeting = greetingMaker "Good Evening" ;  ...     if daytime alert daytimeGreeting name  ;     if night alert nightGreeting name  ;  6.7  Create a Function That Remembers Its State  103   Discussion We want to avoid global variables as much as possible because of potential clashes between libraries. However, there are times when you need to store data to be used across several function calls, and you don’t want to have to repeatedly send this infor- mation to the function each time. A way to persist this data from one function to another other is to create one of the functions within the other, so both have access to the data, and then return the inner function from the outer. Returning one function from another is known as a function closure. Before I get into the specifics of function closure, I want to spend a few minutes on functions and scope.  This  type  of  function  closure  is  also  known  as  a  partial  function,  or currying, which is covered in detail in Recipe 6.8.  In the solution, the inner function  addName is defined in the outer function  greeting Maker. Both of the functions have one argument. The inner function has access to both its argument and the outer function’s argument, but the outer function cannot access the argument passed to the inner function. The inner function can operate on the outer function’s parameters because it is operating within the same context, or scope, of the outer function. In JavaScript, there is one scope that is created for the outermost application environ- ment. All global variables, functions, and objects are contained within this outer scope. When you create a function, you create a new scope that exists as long as the function exists. The function has access to all variables in its scope, as well as all of the variables from the outer scope, but the outer scope does not have access to the variables in the function. Because of these scoping rules, we can access window and document objects in all of our browser applications, and the inner function in the solution can also access the data passed to, or originating in, the outer function that wraps it.  This also explains how the recursive functions in Recipe 6.6 can inter- nally access the variables they’re assigned to in the outer application scope.  However, the outer function cannot access the inner function’s arguments or local data, because they exist in a different scope. An inner function doesn’t have to be returned from the outer function. It could be an invoked direction in the code in the outer function. When it is returned, like in the solution, and the following code:  104  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   function outer  x  {   return function y  { return x * y; }; }  var multiThree = outer 3 ; alert multiThree 2  ;    6 is printed alert multiThree 3  ;    9 is printed  the returned function forms a closure. A JavaScript closure is a variable local to a func- tion that remains alive when the function returns. When the inner function is returned from the outer function, its application scope at the time, including all references to the outer function’s variables, is now passed to the outer, global scope. So even though the outer function’s application scope no longer exists, the inner function’s scope exists at the time the function was returned, including a snapshot of the outer function’s data. It will continue to exist until the application is finished, and the outer, global scope is released.  Another way a closure can be made is if an inner function is assigned to a global variable.  So what happens to these variables when an application scope is released? JavaScript supports automatic garbage collection. What this means is you and I don’t have to manually  allocate  or  deallocate  memory  for  our  variables.  Instead,  the  memory  for variables is created automatically when we create variables and objects, and deallocated automatically when the variable scope is released. In the solution, the outer function greetingMaker takes one argument, which is a specific greeting. It also returns an inner function, addName, which itself takes the person’s name. In the code, greetingMaker is called twice, once with a daytime greeting, assigned to a variable called daytimeGreeting, and once with a nighttime greeting, assigned to a var- iable called nightGreeting. Now, whenever we want to greet someone in daytime, we can use the daytime greeting function, daytimeGreeting, passing in the name of the person. The same applies to the nighttime greeting function, nightGreeting. No matter how many times each is used, the greeting string doesn’t need to be respecified: we just pass in a different name. The specialized variations of the greeting remain in scope until the page that contains the application is unloaded from the browser. Closures are interesting and useful, especially when working with JavaScript objects, as we’ll see later in the book. But there is a downside to closures that turns up when we create accidental closures. An accidental closure occurs when we code JavaScript that creates closures, but aren’t aware that we’ve done so. Each closure takes up memory, and the more closures we  6.7  Create a Function That Remembers Its State  105   create, the more memory is used. The problem is compounded if the memory isn’t released when the application scope is released. When this happens, the result is a persistent memory leak. Here’s an example of an accidental closure:  function outerFunction   {    var doc = document.getElementById "doc" ;    var newObj = { 'doc' : doc};    doc.newObj = newObj; }  The newObj contains one property, doc, which contains a reference to the page element identified by doc. But then, this element is given a new property, newObj, which contains a reference to the new object you just created, which in turn contains a reference to the page element. This is a circular reference from object to page element, and page element to object. The problem with this circular reference is exacerbated in earlier versions of IE, because IE does not release memory associated with DOM objects  such as the doc element  if application scope is released. Even leaving the page does not reclaim the memory: you have to close the browser.  Other browsers detected this type of situation and performed a cleanup when the user left the application  the web page where the JavaScript resided .  Luckily,  newer  versions  of  IE  don’t  have  this  problem.  However,  function  closures should be deliberate, rather than accidental. See Also More on function closures and private function methods in Chapter 16. An excellent overview of function scope and closure is “JavaScript Closures”, by Richard Cornford. Though written in 2004, it’s still one of the best descriptions of closures. Mozilla pro- vides a nice, clean description of closures at https:  developer.mozilla.org en Core_Java Script_1.5_Guide Working_with_Closures. Recipe 6.8 also makes use of specialized function closure, specifically for simplifying the number of arguments that have to be passed to functions, an effect called currying.  106  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   6.8  Improving Application Performance with a Generalized Currying Function Problem You have several functions you want to simplify by attaching recurring argument values to the functions, so the arguments don’t have to be repeated. Solution Use the concept of currying, a specialized form of function closure, to create a function generator that takes the function name and the persisted arguments, and returns a new partial function that only needs the remaining arguments. Here is the curry function I adapted from a function created by Dustin Diaz, which works in all of this book’s target browsers:  function curry  fn, scope  {     var scope = scope  window;     var args = [];     for  var i=2, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i  {         args.push arguments[i] ;     };     return function   {         var args2 = [];         for  var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++  {             args2.push arguments[i] ;          }          var argstotal = args.concat args2 ;          return fn.apply scope, argstotal ;     }; }  function diffPoint  x1, y1, x2, y2  {    return [Math.abs x2 - x1 , Math.abs y2 - y1 ]; } var diffOrigin = curry diffPoint, null, 3.0, 4.0 ; var newPt = diffOrigin 6.42, 8.0 ;    array with 3.42, 4  When you want to curry a function, you pass the function name, and whatever values you want statically assigned to the returned function:  Discussion A typical function could be like the following, which takes two pairs of numbers  an origin and a new location  and returns an array with the difference between the two:  function diffPoint  x1, y1, x2, y2  {   return [x2 - x1, y2 - y1]; }  6.8  Improving Application Performance with a Generalized Currying Function  107   The function is fine, but if the origin is going to be the same across many calls to the function,  wouldn’t  it  be  nice  to  somehow  attach  this  information  to  the  function? Currying is the process that allows us to do this. Currying is a way of statically attaching more than one argument to a function, so the argument doesn’t have to be duplicated. We demonstrated one form of currying in Recipe 6.7, but in that case, we created a single purpose outer function in order to provide the currying functionality for the inner function. In the solution, what I’ve done is create a multipurpose currying function that can perform this functionality for any method in which we want to split parameters between those repeated and those not. In the curry method, I capture the arguments for the first function  call,  and  those  from  the  second,  concatenate  the  two,  and  then  use  the Function apply method to return a function with the combined set of arguments. The code then uses the curry method to create a new function, diffOrigin, that finds the difference between the point and a given origin, in this case, where origin is at x = 3, y = 4:  var diffOrigin = curry diffPoint, null, 3.0, 4.0 ; var newPt = diffOrigin 6.42, 8.0 ;    array with 3.42, 4  We can use the same curry method with diffPoint and another set of origin points:  var farPoint = curry  diffPoint, null, 183.66, 98.77 ;  and then use it as many times as needed:  var ptA = farPoint 1.33, 2.11 ; var point0 = genFunction 0,0 ;     182.329999..., 96.66  The curry method can also take a scope as an argument. In the example, there is no specialized scope, so the window object is used. However, I could also have passed in a reference to an element or other object, and then the inner function would have access to that object’s context. See Also A curry method is provided in many JavaScript libraries, such as Dojo, jQuery, and Prototype.js, either directly or as an extension. The Function apply method is demon- strated in Chapter 16, beginning with Recipe 16.5. See another example of function closure and currying in Recipe 6.7.  108  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   6.9  Improve Application Performance with Memoization  Caching Calculations  Problem You want to optimize your JavaScript applications and libraries by reducing the need to repeat complex and CPU-intensive computations. Solution Use function memoization in order to cache the results of a complex calculation. Here, I’m  borrowing  an  example  from  Douglas  Crockford’s  book,  JavaScript:  The  Good Parts  O’Reilly , as applied to the code to generate a Fibonacci number:  var fibonacci = function    {    var memo = [0,1];    var fib = function  n  {       var result = memo[n];       if  typeof result != "number"  {     result = fib n -1  + fib n - 2 ;      memo[n] = result;       }       return result;    };    return fib; }  ;  return 1; return 1; return 1 * 2; return 1 * 2 * 3; return 1 * 2 * 3 * 4; But we can also view it as:     0!    1!    2!    3!    4! 3! * 4    4!  Discussion Memoization is the process where interim values are cached, rather than recreated, cutting down on the number of iterations and computation time. It works especially well with something like the Fibonacci numbers, or factorials, both of which operate against previously calculated values. For instance, we can look at a factorial, 4!, as follows:  In other words, if we cache the value for 2! when creating 3!, we don’t need to recalculate 1 * 2; and if we cache 3! when calculating 4!, we don’t need 1 * 2 * 3, and so on.  6.9  Improve Application Performance with Memoization  Caching Calculations    109   Memoization is built into some languages, such as Java, Perl, Lisp, and others, but not into JavaScript. If we want to memoize a function, we have to build the functionality ourselves. The key to the effective use of memoization is being aware that the technique doesn’t result in performance improvements until the number of operations is signifi- cant enough to compensate for the extra effort. Example 6-3 shows the memoized and nonmemoized versions of the Fibonacci func- tion that Crockford provided in his book. The example also uses the Console API to record times, so you’ll need to run the application in Firefox or Safari. Make sure the tool’s Console is open. Note that the calculations are intense and can take a consider- able time. Save any work you have in other tabs. You may have to override a message given by the browser, too, about killing a script that’s running a long time.  Example 6-3.

There has been effort to create memoize functions that can work with all functions that would benefit. Crock- ford provided one in his book, JavaScript: The Good Parts  O’Reilly .

Solution Use an anonymous function to wrap variables and functions both:       faux Global      function   {   var i = 0;    function increment   {     i++;     alert "value is " + i ;   }    function runIncrement   {     while  i < 5  {       increment  ;     }   }    window.onload=function   {     runIncrement  ;   } }   ;           112  Chapter 6: Building Reusability with JavaScript Functions   Discussion The functionality demonstrated in the solution has existed for some time, but I’ve only seen anonymous functions as a way to scope what would normally be global variables in John Resig’s work with the jQuery framework library. It’s used as a way of wrapping jQuery plug-in functions so that the code can use the jQuery dollar sign function  $  when the jQuery plug-in is used with another framework library, such as Prototype, which also uses the dollar sign function:     swap colors, blue and red  function $  {     $.fn.flashBlueRed = function   {        return this.each function   {          var hex = $.bbConvertRGBtoHex $ this .css "background-color"  ;          if  hex == "0000ff"  {              $ this .css "background-color", "ff0000" ;           } else {              $ this .css "background-color", "0000ff" ;           }         } ;     }; }  jQuery ;  The approach consists of surrounding the code block with parentheses, beginning with the anonymous function syntax, and following up with the code block and then the final function closure. It could be the following, if there’s no parameter passed into the code block:  or the following, if you are passing a parameter into the function:  }   ;  }  jQuery ;  Now you can use as many “global” variables as you need without polluting the global space or colliding with global variables used in other libraries. See Also Recipe 17.7 covers writing jQuery plug-ins.  6.10  Using an Anonymous Function to Wrap Global Variables   113    CHAPTER 7 Handling Events  7.0  Introduction Events, especially within an interactive environment such as a browser, are what make JavaScript essential. There is very little JavaScript functionality that isn’t triggered by some event, even if the only event that occurs is a web page being loaded. Event handling in JavaScript depends on determining which event or events you want to trigger some activity, and then attaching JavaScript functionality to the event. The earliest form of event handling is still one of the most common: the use of an event handler. An event handler is an element property that you can assign a function, such as the following, which assigns a function to the window.onload event handler:  window.onload=someFunction;  You can also assign an event handler directly in an element, such as in the opening body tag:     However, I don’t recommend embedding events directly in page elements, as it makes it difficult to find and change the event handling routines later. If you use the first approach, which is to assign a function to an event handler in script element or in a JavaScript library, you only have to look in one place in order to make changes.  JavaScript  lives  in  an  enormous  number  of  environments,  as  Chap- ter 21 demonstrates. Most of this chapter is focused on JavaScript within a browser or browser-like environment.  Some Common Events There are several events that can be captured via JavaScript, though not all are available to all web page elements. The load and unload events are typically used with the window object to signal when the page is finished loading, and just before the page is unloaded  115   because the web page reader is navigating away from the page. The submit and reset events are used with forms to signal when the form is submitted, or has been reset by the reader. The blur and focus events are frequently used with form elements, to determine when an element gets focus, and loses it. Changing a form value can trigger the change event.  The blur and change events are especially handy if you need to validate the form values. Most web page elements can receive the click or dblclick event. Other mouse events include mousedown, mousemove, mouseout, mouseover, and mouseup, which can be used to track the cursor and mouse activity. You can also track keyboard activity with events such as keydown and keyup, as well as keypress. If something can be scrolled, you can typically capture a scroll event. Event History and New Event Handling There’s a history to event handling with JavaScript. The earliest form of event handling is frequently termed “DOM Level 0” event handling, even though there is no DOM Level 0. It involves assigning a function directly to an event handler. You can assign the event handler in the element directly:  or assign a function to the event handler in a script element or JavaScript library:     window.onload=someFunction;  In the last several years, a newer DOM Level 2 event handling system has emerged and achieved widespread use. With DOM Level 2 event handling, you don’t assign a func- tion to an event handler directly; instead, you add the function as an event listener:  window.addEventListener "load",loadFunction,false ;  The general syntax is:  targetElement.addEventListener typeOfEvent,listenerFunction,                  useCapture ;  The last parameter in the function call has to do with how events are handled in a stack of nested elements. For example, if you’re capturing an event for a link within a div element, and you want both elements to do some processing based on the event, when you assign the event listener to the link, set the last parameter to false, so the event bubbles up to the div element. You can also remove event listeners, as well as cancel the events themselves. You can also prevent the event from propagating if the element receiving the event is nested in another element. Canceling an event is helpful when dealing with form validation, and preventing event propagation is helpful when processing click events. It’s up to you to decide which level of event handling meets your needs. If you’re doing simple event handling—not using any external JavaScript libraries and not worried  116  Chapter 7: Handling Events   about canceling events, or whether events bubble up in a stack of elements—you can use DOM Level 0 events. Most of the examples in this book use window.onload to trigger the demonstration JavaScript. If you need the more sophisticated event handling, including the ability to more easily control events, you’ll want to use DOM Level 2 events. They can be easily encapsulated into a JavaScript library, and can be safely integrated into a multi-JavaScript library environment. However, the fly in this little event handling pie is that the DOM Level 2 event handling isn’t supported universally by all browsers: Microsoft has not imple- mented DOM Level 2 event handling with IE8 or earlier. However, it’s fairly simple to work around the cross-browser issues, as detailed in Recipe 7.3.  There’s ongoing work to create a new DOM Level 3 event handling, which builds on the work of the DOM Level 2 event handling and is included as part of the Web Applications work at the W3C. However, implementation of the newer material is sparse, at best.  New Events, New Uses There are newer events to go with the newer models, and to go with a nonbrowser- specific  DOM.  As  examples  of  DOM  events,  the  DOMNodeInserted  and  DOMNodeRe moved events are triggered when a node is added or removed from the page’s document tree. However, I don’t recommend using the W3C event for general web pages, as these events are not supported in the current versions of IE, and only partially supported in most  other  browsers.  Most  web  application  authors  wouldn’t  need  these  events, anyway. There are also events associated with the increasingly popular mobile and other hand- held computing environments. For instance, Firefox has a nonstandard set of events having to do with touch swiping, which Mozilla calls the mouse gesture events. It’s in- teresting, but use with caution until there’s wider acceptance of the newer events. We’ll take a look at one type of mobile device event handling towards the end of the chapter. See Also See Recipe 7.3 for a demonstration of handling cross-browser event handling.  7.1  Detecting When the Page Has Finished Loading Problem You want to run a function after the page is finished loading.  7.1  Detecting When the Page Has Finished Loading  117   Solution Capture the load event via the onload event handler on the window:  window.onload=functionName;  Or:  window.onload=function   {    var someDiv = document.getElementById "somediv" ;    ... }  Discussion Prior to accessing any page element, you have to first make sure it’s been loaded into the browser. You could add a script block into the web page after the element. A better approach, though, is to capture the window load event and do your element manipu- lation at that time. This recipe uses the DOM Level 0 event handling, which assigns a function or func- tionality to an event handler. An event handler is an object property with this syntax:  element.onevent=functionName;  Where element is the target element for the event, and onevent is the specific event handler. Since the event handler is a property of the window object, as other objects also have access to their own event handler properties, it’s accessed using dot nota- tion  . , which is how object properties are accessed in JavaScript. The window onload event handler in the solution is assigned as follows:  window.onload=functionName;  You could also use the onload event handler directly in the element. For the window load event, attach the onload event handler to the body element:     Use caution with assigning event handlers directly in elements, though, as it becomes more difficult to find them if you need to change them at a later time. There’s also a good likelihood of element event handlers eventually being deprecated. See Also See Recipe 7.3 for a discussion about the problems with using this type of DOM Level 0 event handling.  118  Chapter 7: Handling Events   7.2  Capturing the Location of a Mouse Click Event Using the Event Object Problem You need to discover the location in the web page where a mouse click occurred. Solution Assign the onclick event handler to the document object, and when the event handler function is processed, access the click location from the Event object:  document.onclick=processClick; ... function processClick evt  {        access event object    evt = evt  window.event;    var x = 0; var y = 0;        if event object has pageX property       get position using pageX, pageY    if  evt.pageX  {       x = evt.pageX;       y = evt.pageY;         else if event has clientX property    } else if  evt.clientX  {       var offsetX = 0; offsetY = 0;            if documentElement.scrollLeft supported       if  document.documentElement.scrollLeft  {           offsetX = document.documentElement.scrollLeft;           offsetY = document.documentElement.scrollTop;       } else if  document.body  {           offsetX = document.body.scrollLeft;           offsetY = document.body.scrollTop;       }        x = evt.clientX + offsetX;       y = evt.clientY + offsetY;     }  alert  "you clicked at x=" + x + " y=" + y ; }  Discussion Whoa! We didn’t expect all of this for a simple task such as finding the location in the page of a mouse click. Unfortunately, this recipe is a good demonstration of the cross- browser challenges associated with JavaScript event handling.  7.2  Capturing the Location of a Mouse Click Event Using the Event Object   119   From the top: first, we need to find information about the event from the event ob- ject. The event object contains information specific to the event, such as what element received the event, the given location relative to the event, the key pressed for a key press event, and so on. In the solution, we immediately run into a cross-browser difference in how we access this object. In IE8 and earlier, the Event object is accessible from the Window object; in other browsers, such as Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari, the Event object is passed, by default, as a parameter to the event handler function. The way to handle most cross-browser object differences is to use a conditional OR    operator, which tests to see if the object is not null. In the case of the event object, the function argument is tested. If it is null, then window.event is assigned to the variable. If it isn’t, then it’s reassigned to itself:  evt = evt  window.event;  You’ll also see another approach that’s not uncommon, and uses the ternary opera- tor, to test to see if the argument has been defined and is not null. If it isn’t, the argument is assigned back to the argument variable. If it is, the window.event object is accessed and assigned to the same argument variable:  evt = evt ? evt : window.event;  Once we’ve worked through the event object difference, we’re on to the next. Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari both get the mouse location in the web page via the non- standard event pageX and pageY properties. However, IE8 doesn’t support these prop- erties. Instead, your code can access the clientX and clientY properties, but it can’t use them as is. You have to adjust the value to account for any offset value, due to the window being scrolled. Again, to find this offset, you have to account for differences, primarily because of different versions of IE accessing your site. Now, we could consider disregarding any- thing older than IE6, and that’s an option. For the moment, though, I’ll show support for versions of IE both older and newer than IE6. For  IE6  strict  and  up,  you’ll  use  document.documentElement.scrollLeft  and  docu ment.documentElement.scrollTop. For older versions, you’ll use document.body.scroll Left and document.body.scrollTop. Here’s an example of using conditional statements:  var offsetX = 0; offsetY = 0; if  document.documentElement.scrollLeft  {    offsetX = document.documentElement.scrollLeft;    offsetY = document.documentElement.scrollTop; } else if  document.body  {    offsetX = document.body.scrollLeft;    offsetY = document.body.scrollTop; }  120  Chapter 7: Handling Events   Once  you  have  the  horizontal  and  vertical  offsets,  add  them  to  the  clientX  and clientY values, respectively. You’ll then have the same value as what you had with pageX and pageY:  x = evt.clientX + offsetX; y = evt.clientY + offsetY;  To see how all of this holds together, Example 7-1 shows a web page with a red box. When you click anywhere in the web page, the box is moved so that the top-left corner of the box is positioned exactly where you clicked. The example implements all of the various cross-browser workarounds, and operates safely in all the main browser types, even various older browsers.  Example 7-1. Capturing the mouse-click location and moving element to location       Box Click Box Move     info {   width: 100px; height: 100px;   background-color: ff0000;   position: absolute;   top: 0;   left: 0; }      window.onload=function   {   document.onclick=processClick; }  function processClick evt  {   evt = evt  window.event;   var x = 0; var y = 0;   if  evt.pageX  {     x = evt.pageX;     y = evt.pageY;   } else if  evt.clientX  {     var offsetX = 0; offsetY = 0;     if  document.documentElement.scrollLeft  {        offsetX = document.documentElement.scrollLeft;        offsetY = document.documentElement.scrollTop;     } else if  document.body  {        offsetX = document.body.scrollLeft;        offsetY = document.body.scrollTop;     }      x = evt.clientX + offsetX;     y = evt.clientY + offsetY;   }  7.2  Capturing the Location of a Mouse Click Event Using the Event Object   121     var style = "left: " + x + "px; top: " + y + "px";   var box = document.getElementById "info" ;   box.setAttribute "style", style ; }             Cross-browser differences may seem overwhelming at times, but most of the code can be packaged into a library as a reusable event handler. However, there is a good like- lihood that many of these browser differences will vanish with IE9.  The  example  doesn’t  work  with  IE7  because  of  the  use  of setAttribute with the style attribute. The downloaded example con- tains a workaround.  See Also Mozilla has, as usual, excellent documentation on the event object at https:  developer .mozilla.org En DOM Event. See Recipe 12.15 for a description of setAttribute.  7.3  Creating a Generic, Reusable Event Handler Function Problem You want to implement DOM Level 2 event handling, but the solution needs to be reusable and cross-browser friendly. Solution Create a reusable event handler function that implements DOM Level 2 event handling, but is also cross-browser friendly. Test for object support to determine which functions to use:  function listenEvent eventTarget, eventType, eventHandler  {    if  eventTarget.addEventListener  {       eventTarget.addEventListener eventType, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventTarget.attachEvent  {       eventType = "on" + eventType;       eventTarget.attachEvent eventType, eventHandler ;    } else {       eventTarget["on" + eventType] = eventHandler;    } }  122  Chapter 7: Handling Events   ... listenEvent document, "click", processClick ;  Discussion The reusable event handler function takes three arguments: the target object, the event  as a string , and the function name. The object is first tested to see if it supports  addEventListener, the W3C DOM Level 2 event listener method. If it is supported, this method is used to map the event to the event handler function. The first two arguments to addEventListener are the event string and the event handler function. The last argument in addEventListener is a Boolean indicating how the event is handled with nested elements  in those cases where more than one element has an event listener attached to the same event . An example would be a div element in a web page document, where both the div and document have event listeners attached to their click events. In the solution, the third parameter is set to false, which means that the listener for an outer element  document  doesn’t “capture” the event, but allows it to be dispatched to the nested elements  the div  first. When the div element is clicked, the event handler function is processed for the div first, and then the document. In other words, the event is allowed to “bubble up” through the nested elements. However,  if  you  set  the  third  parameter  to  true,  the  event  is  captured  in  the  outer element, and then allowed to “cascade down” to the nested elements. If you were to click the div element, the document’s click event would be processed first, and then the div. Most of the time, we want the events to bubble up from inner nested elements to outer elements,  which  is  why  the  generic  function  is  set  to  false  by  default.  However,  to provide flexibility, you could add a third parameter to the reusable function, allowing the  users  to  determine  whether  they  want  the  default  bubble-up  behavior  or  the cascade-down instead.  Most  JavaScript  libraries,  applications,  and  developers  assume  that events are processed in a bubble-up fashion. If you are using external material, be very cautious about setting events to be cascade-down.  To return to the solution, if addEventListener is not supported, then the application checks to see if attachEvent is supported, which is what Microsoft supports in IE8. If this method is supported, the event is first modified by prepending “on” to it  required for use with attachEvent , and then the event and event handler function are mapped. Notice that attachEvent doesn’t have a third parameter to control whether the event is bubble-up or cascade-down. That’s because Microsoft only supports bubble-up.  7.3  Creating a Generic, Reusable Event Handler Function  123   Lastly, in the rare case where neither addEventListener nor attachEvent is supported, the fallback method is used: the DOM Level 0 event handling. If we’re not worried about very old browsers, such as IE5, we can leave off the last part. Why go through all of this work when we can just use the simpler DOM Level 0 event handling? The quick answer is compatibility. When we use DOM Level 0 event handling, we’re assigning an event handler function to an object’s event:  document.onclick=functionName;  If we’re using one or more JavaScript libraries in addition to our code, we can easily wipe out the JavaScript library’s event handling. The only way to work around the overwriting  problem  is  the  following,  created  by  highly  respected  developer  Simon Willison:  function addLoadEvent func  {   var oldonload = window.onload;   if  typeof window.onload != 'function'  {     window.onload = func;   } else {     window.onload = function   {       if  oldonload  {         oldonload  ;       }       func  ;     }   } }  In the function, whatever the window.onload event handler is assigned, is assigned to a variable. The type is checked and if it’s not a function, we can safely assign our function. If it is, though, we assign an anonymous function to the event handler, and in the anonymous function, invoke both our function and the one previously assigned. However, a better option is to use the more modern event listeners. With DOM Level 2 event listeners, each library’s function is added to the event handler without over- writing what already exists; they’re even processed in the order they’re added.  The differences in how browsers handle events goes much deeper than what method to use. Recipes 7.5 and 7.7 cover other differences asso- ciated with the cross-browser event handling.  To summarize, if you’re just doing a quick and dirty JavaScript application, without using any libraries, you can get away with DOM Level 0 events. I use them for most of the small examples in this book. However, if you’re building web pages that could use libraries  some  day,  you’re  better  off  using  DOM  Level  2.  Luckily,  most  JavaScript libraries already provide the cross-browser event handling functions.  124  Chapter 7: Handling Events   Reusable, DOM Level 2 event handling: piece of cake. Except that we’re not finished.  Creating a universal stop-listening function There will be times when we want to stop listening to an event, so we need to create a cross-browser function to handle stopping events:  function stopListening  eventTarget,eventType,eventHandler  {    if  eventTarget.removeEventListener  {       eventTarget.removeEventListener eventType,eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventTarget.detachEvent  {       eventType = "on" + eventType;       eventTarget.detachEvent eventType,eventHandler ;    } else {       eventTarget["on" + eventType] = null;    } }  Again, from the top: the W3C DOM Level 2 method is removeEventListener. If this method exists on the object, it’s used; otherwise, the object is tested to see if it has a method named detachEvent, Microsoft’s version of the method. If found, it’s used. If not, the final DOM Level 0 event is to assign the event handler property to null. Now, once we want to stop listening to an event, we can just call stopListening, passing in the same three arguments: target object, event, and event handler function.  IE8 does not support DOM Level 2 event handling, but IE9 will. How- ever, until older versions of IE, such as IE7 and IE8, vanish from use, you’ll most likely need to continue using the cross-browser technique covered in this recipe.  7.4  Canceling an Event Based on Changed Circumstance Problem You need to cancel an event, such as a form submission, before the event propagates to other elements. Solution Create a reusable function that will cancel an event:     cancel event function  cancelEvent  event  {    if  event.preventDefault  {       event.preventDefault  ;    } else {       event.returnValue = false;    } }  7.4  Canceling an Event Based on Changed Circumstance  125   ...  function validateForm evt  {    evt = evt  window.event;    cancelEvent evt ; }  function formSubmitFunction   { ... if  bad     return false }  Discussion You may want to cancel an event before it completes processing, such as preventing the default submission of a form, if the form elements don’t validate. If you were using a purely DOM Level 0 event handling procedure, you could cancel an event just by returning false from the event handler:  However, with the new, more sophisticated event handling, we need a function like that shown in the solution, which cancels the event, regardless of event model. In  the  solution,  the  event  is  passed  as  an  argument  to  the  function  from  the  event handler function. If the event object has a method named preventDefault, it’s called.  The preventDefault method prevents the default action, such as a form submission, from taking place. If preventDefault is not supported, the event property returnValue is set to false in the solution, which is equivalent to what we did with returning false from the function for DOM Level 0 event handling.  7.5  Preventing an Event from Propagating Through a Set of Nested Elements Problem You have one element nested in another. Both capture the click event. You want to prevent the click event from the inner element from bubbling up or propagating to the outer event. Solution Stop the event from propagating with a generic routine that can be used with the ele- ment and any event:     stop event propagation function  cancelPropagation  event  {  126  Chapter 7: Handling Events      if  event.stopPropagation  {        event.stopPropagation  ;    } else {       event.cancelBubble = true;    } }  In the event handler for the inner element click event, call the function, passing in the event object:  cancelPropagation event ;  Discussion If we don’t want to cancel an event, but do want to prevent it from propagating, we need to stop the event propagation process from occurring. For now, we have to use a cross-browser  method,  since  IE8  doesn’t  currently  support  DOM  Level  2  event handling. In the solution, the event is tested to see if it has a method called stopPropagation. If it does, this event is called. If not, then the event cancelBubble property is set to true. The first method works with Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera, while the latter property works with IE. To see this work, Example 7-2 shows a web page with two div elements, one nested in another and both assigned a click event handler function. When the inner div element is clicked, two messages pop up: one for the inner div element, one for the other. When a button in the page is pressed, propagation is turned off for the event. When you click the inner div again, only the message for the inner div element is displayed.  Example 7-2. Preventing an event from propagating among nested elements       Prevent Propagation    one {    width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: 0f0; } two {    width: 50px; height: 50px; background-color: f00; } stop {   display: block; }         global for signaling propagation cancel var stopPropagation = false;  7.5  Preventing an Event from Propagating Through a Set of Nested Elements   127   function listenEvent eventTarget, eventType, eventHandler  {    if  eventTarget.addEventListener  {       eventTarget.addEventListener eventType, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventTarget.attachEvent  {       eventType = "on" + eventType;       eventTarget.attachEvent eventType, eventHandler ;    } else {       eventTarget["on" + eventType] = eventHandler;    } }     cancel propagation function  cancelPropagation  event  {    if  event.stopPropagation  {       event.stopPropagation  ;    } else {       event.cancelBubble = true;    } }  listenEvent window,"load",function   {    listenEvent document.getElementById "one" ,"click",clickBoxOne ;    listenEvent document.getElementById "two" ,"click",clickBoxTwo ;    listenEvent document.getElementById "stop" ,"click",stopProp ;   } ;  function stopProp   {     stopPropagation = true; }  function clickBoxOne evt  {   alert "Hello from One" ; }  function clickBoxTwo evt  {   alert "Hi from Two" ;   if  stopPropagation  {      cancelPropagation evt ;   } }             Inner       Stop Propagation     128  Chapter 7: Handling Events  The button event handler only sets a global variable because we’re not worried about its event propagation. Instead, we need to call cancelPropagation in the click event   handler for the div elements, when we’ll have access to the actual event we want to modify. Example 7-2 also demonstrates one of the challenges associated with cross-browser event handling. There are two click event handler functions: one for the inner div ele- ment, one for the outer. Here’s a more efficient click handler method function:  function clickBox evt  {    evt = evt  window.event;    alert "Hi from " + this.id ;    if  stopPropagation  {       cancelPropagation evt ;    } }  This function combines the functionality contained in the two functions in the example. If stopPropagation is set to false, both elements receive the event. To personify the message, the identifier is accessed from the element context, via this. Unfortunately,  this  won’t  work  with  IE8.  The  reason  is  that  event  handling  with attachEvent is managed via the window object, rather than the DOM. The element context, this, is not available. You can access the element that receives the event via the event object’s srcElement property. However, even this doesn’t work in the exam- ple, because the srcElement property is set to the first element that receives the event, and isn’t updated when the event is processed for the next element as the event prop- agates through the nested elements. When using DOM Level 0 event handling, these problems don’t occur. Microsoft has access to the element context, this, in the handler function, regardless of propagation. We could use the above function only if we assign the event handler for the two div elements using DOM Level 0:  document.getElementById "one" .onclick=clickBox; document.getElementById "two" .onclick=clickBox;  7.6  Capturing Keyboard Activity Problem You want to capture keyboard events for a textarea, and look for specific character uses. Solution Capture the keyboard activity for a textarea element and check the ASCII value of the character to find the character or characters of interest: var inputTextArea = document.getElementById "source" ; listenEvent inputTextArea,"keypress",processKeyStroke ; function processKeyStroke evt  {  7.6  Capturing Keyboard Activity  129      evt = evt ? evt : window.event;    var key = evt.charCode ? evt.charCode : evt.keyCode;       check to see if character is ASCII 38, or the ampersand  &     if  key == "38"        ... Discussion There are multiple events associated with the keyboard:  keydown  keyup  keypress  textInput  Key is pressed down.  Key is released.  Follows keydown.  Follows keypress  Safari only .  Let’s look more closely at keypress and keydown. When a key is pressed down, it generates a keydown event, which records that a key was depressed. The keypress event, though, represents the character being typed. If you press the Shift key and the “L” key to get a capital letter L, you’ll get two events if you listen to keydown, but you only get one event if you listen with keypress. The only time you’ll want to use keydown is if you want to capture every key stroke. In the solution, the keypress event is captured and assigned an event handler function. In the event handler function, the event object is accessed to find the ASCII value of the key pressed  every key on a keyboard has a related ASCII numeric code . Cross- browser functionality is used to access this value: IE and Opera do not support char Code, but do support keyCode; Safari, Firefox, and Chrome support charCode.  Not listed in the possible keyboard events is the textInput event, which is part of the new DOM Level 3 event specification currently in draft state. It also represents a character being typed. However, its imple- mentation is sparse, and based on an editor draft, not a released speci- fication. Stick with keypress for now.  To  demonstrate  how  keypress  works,  Example  7-3  shows  a  web  page  with  a textarea. When you open the page, you’ll be prompted for a “bad” ASCII character code, such as 38 for an ampersand  & . When you start typing in the textarea, all of the characters are reflected in the textarea except for the “bad” character. When this character is typed, the event is canceled, the default keypress behavior is interrupted, and the character doesn’t appear in the textarea.  130  Chapter 7: Handling Events   Example 7-3. Preventing a keyboard value based on ASCII value of key       Filtering Input     var badChar;  function listenEvent eventTarget, eventType, eventHandler  {    if  eventTarget.addEventListener  {       eventTarget.addEventListener eventType, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventTarget.attachEvent  {       eventType = "on" + eventType;       eventTarget.attachEvent eventType, eventHandler ;   } else {      eventTarget["on" + eventType] = eventHandler;   } }     cancel event function  cancelEvent  event  {    if  event.preventDefault  {       event.preventDefault  ;       event.stopPropagation  ;    } else {       event.returnValue = false;       event.cancelBubble = true;    } }  window.onload=function   {    badChar = prompt "Enter the ASCII value of the keyboard key you want to filter","" ;    var inputTA = document.getElementById "source" ;    listenEvent inputTA,"keypress",processClick ; } function processClick evt  {    evt = evt  window.event;    var key = evt.charCode ? evt.charCode : evt.keyCode;        zap that bad boy    if  key == badChar  cancelEvent evt ; }                  Other than being a devious and rather nasty April Fool’s joke you can play on your blog commenters, what’s the purpose of this type of application?  7.6  Capturing Keyboard Activity  131   Well, a variation of the application can be used to filter out nonescaped characters such as ampersands in comments for pages served up as XHTML. XHTML does not allow for nonescaped ampersands. The program could also be adapted to listen for amper- sands, and replace them with the escaped versions  &amp; . Normally, you would escape text as a block on the server before storing in the database, but if you’re doing a live echo as a preview, you’ll want to escape that material before you redisplay it to the web page. And it makes a wicked April Fool’s joke on your blog commenters.  The use of the prompt can trigger a security warning with IE.

Solution Use the new HTML5 native drag-and-drop, which is an adaptation of the drag-and- drop  technique  supported  in  Microsoft  Internet  Explorer.  Example  7-4  provides  a demonstration.

The example does not work with IE7, either.  Currently, implementations of HTML5 drag-and-drop are not robust or  consistent.  Use  with  caution  until  the  functionality  has  broader support.  Drag-and-drop in HTML5 is not the same as in previous implementations, because what you can drag is mutable. You can drag text, images, document nodes, files, and a host of objects.  134  Chapter 7: Handling Events   To  demonstrate  HTML5  drag-and-drop  at  its  simplest,  we’ll  explore  how  Exam- ple  7-4  works.  First,  to  make  an  element  draggable,  you  have  to  set  an  attribute, draggable,  to  true.  In  the  example,  the  draggable  element  is  given  an  identifier  of item. Safari also requires an additional CSS style setting:  -khtml-user-drag: element;  The allowable values for -khtml-user-drag are:  Allows element to be dragged.  element  auto  none  Default logic to determine whether element is dragged  only images, links, and text can be dragged by default .  Element cannot be dragged.  Since I’m allowing a div element to be dragged, and it isn’t a link, image, or text, I needed to set -khtml-user-drag to element. The element that can be dragged must have the draggable attribute set to true. It could be set in code, using setAttribute:  item.setAttribute "draggable","true" ;  However, IE doesn’t pick up the change in state; at least, it doesn’t pick up the CSS style change for a draggable object. Instead, it’s set directly on the object:       The dragstart event handler for the same element is where we set the data being trans- ferred with the drag operation. In the example, since I’m dragging an element node, I’m  going  to  set  the  data  type  to  “text”  and  provide  the  identifier  of  the  element  accessible via target, which has the element context . You can specify the element directly, but this is a more complex operation. For instance, in Firefox, I could try the following, which is derived from the Mozilla documentation:  evt.dataTransfer.setData "application x-moz-node",target ;  and then try to process the element at the drop end:  var item = evt.dataTransfer.getData "application x-moz-node" ; target.appendChild item ;  However, the item gets set to a serialized form of the div element, not an actual reference to the div element. In the end, it’s easier just to set the data transfer to text, and transfer the identifier for the element, as shown in Example 7-4.  7.7  Using the New HTML5 Drag-and-Drop  135   You can also set several different kinds of data to be transferred, while your drop targets only look for specific types. There doesn’t have to be a one-to-one mapping. Also note that WebKit Safari doesn’t handle the MIME types correctly unless you use getData and setData specifically.  The next part of the drag-and-drop application has to do with the drag receiver. In the example, the drag receiver is another div element with an identifier of “drop”. Here’s another instance where things get just a tad twisted. There are a small group of events associated with HTML5 drag-and-drop:  Drag is over the target; used to determine if target will accept drop.  Drag is over target; used to determine feedback to user.  dragstart  Drag event starts.  During the drag operation.  drag  dragenter  dragover  drop  Drop occurs.  dragleave  dragend  Drag leaves target.  Drag operation ends.  The dragged item responds to dragstart, drag, and dragend. The target responds to dragenter, dragover, dragleave, and drop. When the dragged object is over the target, if the target wants to signal it can receive the drop, it must cancel the event. Since we’re dealing with browsers that implement DOM Level 2 event handling, the event is canceled using the  cancelEvent reusable function created in an earlier recipe. The code also returns false:  function dragOver evt  {   if  evt.preventDefault  evt.preventDefault  ;   evt = evt  window.event;   evt.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'copy';   return false; }  In addition, the dragenter event must also be canceled, either using preventDefault or returning false in the inline event handler, as shown in the example.  136  Chapter 7: Handling Events   Both dragenter and dragover must be canceled if you want the target element to receive the drop event.  When the drop event occurs, the drop event handler function uses getData to get the identifier for the element being dragged, and then uses the DOM appendChild method to append the element to the new target. For a before and after look, Figure 7-1 shows the page when it’s loaded and Figure 7-2 shows the page after the drag-and-drop event.  Figure 7-1. Web page with drag-and-drop enabled; before drag-and-drop  I also had to cancel event propagation with the receiver element, though it’s not re- quired in all browsers. In the example, I use an anonymous function for the dragstart and drop event handler functions. The reason is that, as mentioned in Recipe 7.5, the  attachEvent method supported by Microsoft does not preserve element context. By using an anonymous function, we can access the element in the other function scope, within the event han- dler functions. I haven’t been a big fan of drag-and-drop in the past. The operation requires a rather complex hand-and-mouse operation, which limits the number of people who can take advantage of this interactive style. Even if you have no problems with fine motor skills,  7.7  Using the New HTML5 Drag-and-Drop  137   Figure 7-2. Web page after drag-and-drop operation  using drag-and-drop with a touch screen or mouse pad can be cumbersome. It’s also been extremely problematic to implement. The current HTML5 specification details newly standardized drag-and-drop function- ality, though not everyone is pleased by the capability. Peter-Paul Koch  PPK  of the well-known  Quirksblog  describes  the  current  implementation  of  drag-and-drop  in HTML5 as the “HTML5 drag-and-drop disaster”, and be aware that the article may not be safe for work . Why? According to PPK, there are several things wrong with the implementation: too many events, confusing implementation details, and inconsisten- cies. One of the biggest concerns PPK mentions is the requirement that if an element is to receive a drop, when it receives either the dragenter or dragover event, it has to cancel the events. I sympathize, but I understand some of the decisions that went into the current imple- mentation of drag-and-drop in HTML5. For instance, we’re dealing with a legacy event handling model, so we can’t invent new event triggers just for drag-and-drop. If, by default, an element is not a valid drag-and-drop target, then the drag-and-drop opera- tion must continue as another target is sought. If the dragged element enters or is over a valid target, though, by canceling the dragenter and dragover events, the target is signaling that yes, it is interested in being a target, and doing so using the only means available to it: by canceling the dragenter and dragover events.  138  Chapter 7: Handling Events   PPK recommends using what he calls “old school” implementations of drag-and-drop. The only issue with those is they aren’t cross-browser friendly, and can be complicated to implement. They’re also not accessible, though accessibility can be added. Gez Lemon wrote an article for Opera on using the WAI-ARIA  Web Accessibility Initiative–Accessible Rich Internet Applications  accessible drag-and-drop features. It’s titled “Accessible drag and drop using WAI-ARIA”. He details the challenges associated with making accessible drag-and-drop, as well as the two drag-and-drop properties associated with WAI-ARIA:  aria-grabbed  aria-dropeffect  Set to true when element is selected for dragging.  Effect that happens when source is released on drag target.  The aria-dropeffect has the following values:  Source is duplicated and dropped on target.  Source is removed and moved to target.  A reference or shortcut to source is created in target.  Function is invoked, and source is input.  copy  move  reference  execute  popup  none  Pop-up menu or dialog presented so user can select an option.  Target will not accept source.  In the article, Gez provides a working example using the existing drag-and-drop capa- bility, and also describes how ARIA can be integrated into the new HTML5 drag-and- drop. The example provided in the article currently only works with Opera, which hasn’t implemented HTML5 drag-and-drop. Yet. But you can check out Figure 7-3 to see how drag-and-drop would look from a keyboard perspective. Though old school drag-and-drop is complicated, several libraries, such as jQuery, provide this functionality, so you don’t have to code it yourself. Best of all, ARIA ac- cessibility is being built into these libraries. Until the HTML5 version of drag-and-drop is widely supported, you should make use of one of the libraries. In addition, as the code demonstrates, drag-and-drop can follow the old school or the new HTML5 method, and the libraries can test to see which is supported and provide the appropriate functionality. We can use the jQuery script.aculo.us, or Dojo drag-and- drop, now and in the future, and not worry about which implementation is used.  7.7  Using the New HTML5 Drag-and-Drop  139   Figure 7-3.

The primary reason is that most mobile devices either react to your web page as any other browser would react, albeit in miniature, or the requirements for mobile development are so extensive as to warrant a separate book. In addition, many small device and touch screen events are proprietary to the browser, such as the one demonstrated in the solution for this recipe. In the solution, we want to capture an orientation change, since devices like the iPhone can flip from portrait to landscape. In the solution, we use the iPhoneOrientation events to first capture the orientation change, and then determine the new orientation. Based  on  orientation,  we  can  do  things  such  as  swap  a  portrait  thumbnail  for  a landscape-based image, or even activate some form of motion. When Apple rolled out the iPhoneOrientation example, it provided a snow globe that would “shake” when orientation changed. Typically, though, sophisticated mobile applications, such as many of those for the iPhone iPod touch, are not web-based. They use a SDK provided by the company, which may actually require that you purchase a subscription. As for general web access for mobile devices, you’re better off providing mobile CSS files for mobile devices. Use proportional sizes for any pop ups and code your page regardless of device. In fact, many mobile devices turn off JavaScript for web pages automatically. As long as you ensure your web page is based on progressive enhancement  fully functional without script , you should be set for the mobile world.

They’re part of what is known as the Browser Object Model  BOM , or the DOM Level 0 set of objects, which also includes the document, frames, and various other elements. Typically though, when we think of browser objects, we think of the first five elements I just mentioned. In the HTML5 specification, these are known as the browsing context. The topmost element is the window, and all the other browser objects are children. You can access the children elements using the window:  var browser = window.navigator.userAgent;  Or you can access the objects directly:  var browser = navigator.userAgent;  When working with the browser objects, be aware that until very recently, none of the objects was covered by a standard specification, and a consistent implementation was not guaranteed. Though most browsers share the same methods and properties, there are also browser-specific properties with each object. Make sure to check your target browsers’ documentation when you work with the objects, and test the pages in all of the browsers. Work is underway with the W3C HTML5 effort to provide a user application object model, which does include all of the browser objects covered in this chapter. However, it’s all very new, and not broadly implemented at the time of this writing. It’s also subject to change, since the HTML5 effort is still ongoing. Where possible, I’ll note how an object or method is changing because of this new work.  143   8.1  Ask the Web Page Reader to Confirm an Action Problem You want to confirm an action with the web page reader. Solution Use the confirm pop-up box:  var answer = confirm "Are you sure you want to do that?" ; if  answer == true  {    alert "You're sure" ; } else {    alert "You decided against" ; }  Discussion There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript. The alert pop up just provides a message, with an OK button to close the pop up:  alert "You're sure" ;  The confirm pop up, demonstrated in the solution, asks a question that is answered true by pushing the OK button, false if the Cancel button is pressed:  var answer = confirm "Are you sure?" ;  The last pop up is the prompt. You supply a string used for the prompt message, and can optionally provide a default response. The web page reader is given an input field to type a response, which is returned:  var answer = prompt "What's your name", "anonymous" ;  You’ll want to provide a default response, even if it’s only an empty string  "" . Use caution when using the prompt pop up, as browser security could block the small window, or require user permission in order to work. Based on the newer levels of security, consider using forms, even for simple, one-answer questions.  8.2  Creating a New, Stripped-Down Browser Window Problem You want to open a web page in a new, stripped-down, fixed-size browser window.  144  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces   Solution Open a new browser window using the window.open method, passing in optional pa- rameters: a URL to load, and a window name:  var newWindow = window.open "http:  oreilly.com", "namedWindow" ;  Discussion In older implementations, the window.open method takes three parameters: the URL, the window name, and the window features as a string of comma-delimited options. If the URL is omitted, the window opens with “about:blank”. If the name is not given,  the default “_blank” is used, which means each window is a new window. If the features string is omitted, default formatting is used. However, the window.open method is changing with HTML5. At the time this was writ- ten, the features string was no longer supported, and a fourth parameter, replace, is a Boolean value that indicates whether the URL replaces the contents in an open window, and removes the existing URL from the window’s history.  Opening a new window can trigger pop up window prevention, and the default behavior can change from browser to browser. For instance, in Firefox 3.x, the new window is opened as a new tab by default, though you can configure it differently in the user preferences.  8.3  Finding Out About the Browser Accessing the Page Problem You want to determine information about the browser accessing the web page. Solution Use  the  Navigator  object  to  discover  information  about  the  browser  and  browser environment:  var browser = navigator.userAgent; var info = " Browser: " + browser + " ";  var platform = navigator.platform; info+=" Platform: " + platform + " ";  Discussion The Navigator object has a wealth of information about the web page reader’s browser, as  well  as  the  operating  system.  The  supported  properties  change  from  browser  to browser, and several properties aren’t of much interest to the average JavaScript de- veloper. At a minimum, most support the helpful properties shown in Table 8-1.  8.3  Finding Out About the Browser Accessing the Page  145   Table 8-1. Navigator properties  Property appCodeName  appName  appVersion  Purpose Code name for the browser Official name of the browser Browser version  cookieEnabled  language  platform  product  userAgent  Whether cookies are enabled Language supported        vendor  Vendor for browser  Example Mozilla Netscape 5.0  Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10_4_11; en  AppleWebKit 531.9  KHTML, like Gecko  Version 4.0.3 Safari 531.9 true if enabled, otherwise false en-US or en MacPPC Gecko Mozilla 5.0  Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3  Gecko  20090824 Firefox 3.5.3 Apple Computer, Inc.  There are also some collections, such as mimeTypes and plugins. It’s interesting to look at the Navigator object contents, and useful for checking im- portant information such as whether cookies are enabled or not. It’s a bad decision, though, to use the Navigator object to detect the browser to determine which code to run. Most browsers are constantly releasing new versions with new functionality. If you code for a browser, you have to change your code each time a browser releases a new browser. Plus it’s very easy to spoof a browser string, so the value is very unreliable. You’re  better  off  using  object,  rather  than  browser,  detection  when  coding  cross- browser applications. See Also To see object detection in action, see Chapter 7, which focuses on event handling and features several instances of using object detection.  8.4  Warning the Web Page Reader About Leaving a Page Problem Your web page reader has clicked a link that takes him out of your website. Because of the sensitive nature of your site, such as a government, bank, or medical organization site, you want to make sure that the person is aware that he’s leaving your site and going to an external site.  146  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces   Solution Add an event listener for the window unload event and then provide a prompt to the web page reader that he’s leaving the site:  window.onunload=goodbye;  function goodbye   {    alert "You're leaving our site. Thanks for stopping by!"; }  Discussion We don’t want to indiscriminately throw up pop ups, or intervene with links or people going about their business, but there are times when we want to ensure that people know that when they click a link, type in a new domain, or even close the browser, they’re leaving the current site. I’ve seen such actions in bank websites, the IRS’s site  U.S. tax organization , and other sites where the type of information being gathered can be quite confidential. You want people to be aware of the fact that they’re leaving the previously secure website and going somewhere that may be less than secure. In particular, providing this functionality is helpful behavior if you provide links to external sites within your web pages. Because the link is in your pages, your web page readers may assume the external site is an offshoot of your own. If the other site re- sembles your site enough, the confusion can be exacerbated. Your readers may provide information to the new site only because they think there is a connection between your site and the external one.  8.5  Changing Stylesheets Depending on Color Support Problem You want to change your site’s stylesheet if the device viewing the page only supports 4-bit grayscale, or 8-bit color. Solution Use the Screen object to check the colorDepth property, and change either a CSS rule or an entire stylesheet based on the findings:  if  window.screen.colorDepth <= 8  {    var style = document.documentElement.style ? document.documentElement.style : document.body.style;    style.backgroundColor="ffffff"; }  8.5  Changing Stylesheets Depending on Color Support   147   Or:  function setActiveStyleSheet title  {   var a;   for var i=0;  a = document.getElementsByTagName "link" [i] ; i++  {      if a.getAttribute "rel" .indexOf "style"  != -1         && a.getAttribute "title"   {        a.disabled = true;        if a.getAttribute "title"  == title  a.disabled = false;      }   } } if  window.screen.colorDepth <= 4  {    setActiveStyleSheet "dull" ; }  Discussion Once upon a time, most computer monitors only supported 8-bit, or 256-color mon- itors. If you used a CSS style color that was beyond what was considered a “web-safe” color, you couldn’t depend on the end result. Where you expected a delicate violet, you might get a washed-out, gray-like color instead. How important is it to support web-safe colors these days? Not too important. Com- puter systems have been beyond the 256-color limit for well over a decade now, and most old 8-bit systems have gone on to their reward or been repurposed into non- graphical Linux boxes. Still, there is a whole new breed of web-accessible tools now, including eReaders, like the Kindle, that are redefining what we think of when it comes to web display. The Kindle supports 4-bit grayscale, and it allows web access. You can either change colors directly, as the solution demonstrates, or you can change the stylesheet. The latter is a better option if you use color and graphics extensively in your website. The stylesheet switcher code in the solution was from an example I provided in my O’Reilly book Painting the Web, which is adapted from an article at A List Apart. The technology is very mature, as the date of the article  2001  demonstrates. Nowadays, people provide different stylesheets based on the use of the media attribute. Some ex- amples of the media attribute are:    print, for printing   handheld, for handheld devices   screen, for typical computer monitors   tv, for television   braille, for Braille tactile devices  148  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces   In addition, there’s an @media rule you can use directly in stylesheets to modify values based on media types. However, there may be cases where there is no media type or @media rule that works—or the result is quirky, at best. Let’s examine the stylesheet switcher from the top. The for loop is controlled by ac- cessing all of the link elements in the web page, which are then assigned, in turn, to a variable, a. In the loop, each is checked to see if it has a rel attribute set to style. If it does, and it has a title, and the title doesn’t match the stylesheet we want, we disable the stylesheet. However, if the title does match, then we enable the stylesheet. See Also For more on the getAttribute method, see Recipe 11.12. Lynda Weinmann is generally regarded as the first person who provided documentation of web-safe colors. You can see the web-safe palette and read more of the history of web-safe colors at http:  www .lynda.com resources webpalette.aspx.  8.6  Modifying Image Dimensions Depending on Page Size Problem You want to set the screen width and serve up an appropriately sized photo. Solution Use the Screen object’s availWidth or width values to determine available space:  window.onload=function   {   if  window.screen.availWidth >= 800  {     var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName "img" ;     for  var i = 0; i < imgs.length; i++  {       var name = imgs[i].src.split "-" ;       var newname = name[0] + "-big.jpg";       imgs[i].src = newname;     }   } }  Discussion The ability to swap images in and out of the page has been around for years, and was a very common form of dynamic HTML at one time. It’s still popular with Ajax-based image libraries and slideshows. The solution assumes that the website can be accessed in browsers or other user agents that are less than 800 pixels in width. It also assumes the images are provided in two sizes,  and  the  names  of  the  images  are  differentiated  between  those  that  are  large  imgname-big.jpg , and small  imgname-thumb.jpg .  8.6  Modifying Image Dimensions Depending on Page Size  149   There are two horizontal properties available with Screen: availWidth and width. The width  property  provides  information  about  the  screen  width,  while  the  availWidth property  provides  information  about  the  browser  width.  In  the  solution,  I’m  using availWidth. In the solution, all of the img elements in the page are accessed, and for each, the name of the current image is accessed. The String split method is used to find the unique part of the image filename  before the dash , which is then concatenated to -big.jpg to set the image src attribute to the larger-sized image. One of the disadvantages to this approach is that the person will see this switching going on. A way around this is to use CSS to modify the width of the image, say to 90% of the page size:  img {    max-width: 90%; }  However, this doesn’t always generate a good image, as browsers don’t do the best job of creating smaller versions of images. The solution also doesn’t take into account the bandwidth necessary to, first, load the larger image. That’s why it’s not unusual for websites just to load the smallest image into the web page by default, and then provide a link to the larger image, or use an image management JavaScript library to load larger images inline when clicking the thumbnail. See Also Probably one of the more popular image JavaScript libraries in use is LightBox2, avail- able at http:  www.huddletogether.com projects lightbox2 .  8.7  Creating Breadcrumbs in a CMS Template Page Problem You want to display footprint information based on the page URL for use in a Content Management System  CMS  template. Solution Use the window.location object to get information about the current page’s URL, and then break it down to provide the footprint information:  var items = location.pathname.substr 1 .split " " ; var breadcrumbTrail = " "; for  var i = 0; i < items.length; i++  {   breadcrumbTrail+=" -> " + items[i];  150  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces   } breadcrumbTrail+=" ";  Discussion The window.location object can be accessed in JavaScript as just location. It has eight properties, all of which describe one aspect of the web page URL, as listed in Table 8-2.  Table 8-2. window.location object properties  Property hash  host  hostname  href  pathname  port  protocol  search  Description Part of URL following , including the  Hostname and optional port Hostname Full URL Relative path name Port number URL protocol Part of the URL following ?, including ?   jscbtest  80  http:  ?q=username  Example mysection burningbird.net or [burningbird.net]:80 burningbird.net  http:  burningbird.net jscbtest  A breadcrumb trail is a reprint of the path relative to the hostname, broken into pieces that can then be accessed directly. You could embed the breadcrumb directly into a web page, but many Content Man- agement Systems  CMS , such as Drupal or Wordpress, use one page as a template for most of the site contents. For instance, Drupal has one page called page.tmpl.php, which serves as the template for most of the content of a Drupal site. Though there are plug-ins and other applications that can embed a breadcrumb, some- times  it’s  just  as  easy  to  use  JavaScript  to  create  the  breadcrumb—especially  if  the navigation to the separate site components is also available in a menu  for accessibility purposes, or if JavaScript is turned off . To demonstrate how to create a breadcrumb, Example 8-1 shows a breadcrumb ap- plication that not only parses out the different relative path components, but surrounds them with a subpath link and adds an arrow annotation.  Example 8-1. Building a breadcrumb trail with window.location         breadcrumb trail      <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {  8.7  Creating Breadcrumbs in a CMS Template Page  151        split relative path   var items = location.pathname.substr 1 .split " " ;       build main path   var mainpath = "<a href='" + location.protocol + "  " +    location.hostname + " ";       begin breadcrumb   var breadcrumbTrail = " ";   for  var i = 0; i < items.length; i++  {         trailing slash     if  items[i].length == 0   break;         extend main path for new level     mainpath+=items[i];         add slash after all but last item     if  i < items.length-1        mainpath+=" ";         create breadcrumb component        add arrows for interior items only     if  i > 0 && i < items.length        breadcrumbTrail+=" -> ";         add crumb     breadcrumbTrail+= mainpath + "'>" + items[i] + " ";   }       insert into page   breadcrumbTrail+=" ";   document.getElementById "breadcrumb" .innerHTML=breadcrumbTrail;  }    -->                152  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces  The application adjusts for the first item in the list  no arrow , as well as the last  no final slash [ ] , and includes handling cases where subdirectories have a trailing slash in the URL. There would be no list items for the main page, so no breadcrumb is printed out. You could adjust the script even further to not insert the empty paragraph element into the script when there are no items, or use different markup. The script is simple, and works whether the page is statically or dynamically generated, as shown in Figure 8-1.   Figure 8-1. A JS-enabled breadcrumb application  8.8  Bookmarking a Dynamic Page Problem You have a dynamic application in which updates occur in the page rather than when the page refreshes. You want to provide a link to your web page reader that not only takes the user back to the page, but returns it to a given state. Solution Use the Location object’s hash property in order to return to the state directly:  var someval = window.location.hash.split "" [1]; if  someval == "state1"  { ... }  Discussion A page fragment  somevalue  isn’t just a way to annotate an in-page link; it can also be a way to restore a state for an application. If dynamic effects are being made in a web page, and you want to preserve state at any time in such a way that a person can return to that state, you can create a unique hash for it and then provide the link to your web page reader. To  demonstrate,  Example  8-2  is  a  web  page  that  has  a  div  wrapping  a  button  and another div, and which changes various CSS-style property attributes with each click of the button. Since we want to give the web page reader the ability to return to a state at any time, a link is generated for that the person. Why don’t I use a stylesheet class and change the class name, rather than set the at- tributes individually? And why call all of the functions in order, rather than directly call  8.8  Bookmarking a Dynamic Page  153   each one? The reason is I’m building on the style settings from each previous function call, rather than resetting the style with each. If I used a class setting with the values, the  results  would  be  vastly  different,  because  the  style  attributes  not  set  would  be returned to their inherited values. That’s the major difference between using a class setting and changing individual style attributes.  Example 8-2. Preserving page state through hash on link       Remember me?        window.onload=function   {           set up button       document.getElementById "next" .onclick=nextPanel;           check for hash, if found, reload state       var hash = window.location.hash.split "" [1];       switch  hash  {         case "one" :            functionOne  ;            break;         case "two" :            functionOne  ;            functionTwo  ;            break;         case "three" :            functionOne  ;            functionTwo  ;            functionThree  ;       }     }        display next panel, based on button's class    function nextPanel   {       var classNm = this.getAttribute "class" ;       switch classNm  {          case "zero" :             functionOne  ;             break;          case "one" :             functionTwo  ;             break;          case "two" :             functionThree  ;        }    }       set both the button class, and create the state link,       add to page    function setPage page  {       document.getElementById "next" .setAttribute "class",page ;  154  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces         var link = document.getElementById "link" ;       var path = location.protocol + "  " + location.hostname + " " +                  location.pathname + "" + page;       link.innerHTML="  link  ";     }        function one, two, three - change div, set button and link    function functionOne   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.backgroundColor="ff0000";       square.style.width="200px";       square.style.height="200px";       square.style.padding="10px";       square.style.margin="20px";       setPage "one" ;    }     function functionTwo   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.backgroundColor="ffff00";       square.style.position="absolute";       square.style.left="200px";       setPage "two" ;    }     function functionThree   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.width="400px";       square.style.height="400px";       square.style.backgroundColor="00ff00";       square.style.left="400px";       setPage "three" ;    }        Next Action     This is the object          In the code, if there is a hash mark given in the window.object, the functions to set the state of the page are called. Since, in this example, each is dependent on what’s hap- pened in the other state functions, they’ll need to be called before the end state. So if the hash mark is three  three , both functionOne and functionTwo need to be called before functionThree, or the div element’s state will be different  the style settings won’t be the same .  8.8  Bookmarking a Dynamic Page  155   The use of set- and getAttribute with the style attribute won’t work with IE7. The downloadable example contains a workaround.  See Also Recipe 12.15 provides a detailed discussion about changing CSS properties for ele- ments. Chapters 13 and 14 demonstrate other dynamic page effects created by setting CSS-style attributes or changing an element’s class name. Recipe 20.1 covers another example in which information can be persisted using the URL. Recipe 20.3 demon- strates state persistence using new HTML5 functionality. Recipe 8.9 extends the concept of state from Example 8-2, so that the example can also work with page refreshes and after the use of the back button. Recipe 11.12 covers the getAttribute method.  8.9  Preserving State for Back Button, Page Refresh Problem You want to store a dynamic page’s effects in such a way that if the web page reader accidentally hits the page refresh or back button, the effects aren’t lost. Solution You set the location object’s hash to preserve state automatically, so a dynamic effect is preserved:     get state var someval = window.location.hash.split "" [1]; if  someval == "state1"  { ... }    set state function setPage page  {   location.hash=page; }  Discussion In Recipe 8.8, links are provided for the web page reader to return to a page state at a later time. The same principle can be used to capture a page state at any time, in case the person accidentally refreshes a page.  156  Chapter 8: Browser Pieces   To modify Example 8-2 to maintain state automatically, all you need to do is modify the setPage function:  function setPage page  {   document.getElementById "next" .setAttribute "class",page ;   location.hash=page; }  Rather than build a link and add to the page, the page is added as a hash to location, which also serves to add the link, with hash, to the page history. With this change, if the person accidentally does a refresh at any point in time, the page will be returned to the exact state it was in before she did the refresh. The use of location and unique hashes to record dynamic state has also been used for the  infamous  back  button  problem  when  it  comes  to  dynamic  or  Ajax-based applications. With most browsers, if you add a new hash with each state change, and then click the back button, you’ll see the address bar reflect the change. What you probably won’t see, though, is the actual state of the change reflected in the page. That’s because even if you change the location in the address bar, you’re not triggering a page reload. And there is no way to capture an address change in order to reload the page. A workaround to this problem is to add a timer that fires at certain intervals, triggering code that checks the current location object and, in turn, triggers a page reload so the page reflects the address bar. Frankly, I’m not overly fond of this approach. I do like the idea of capturing state because of accidental page refreshes, or providing a bookmark link. I haven’t found repairing the back button to be a serious concern. At least, not until the state of technology is such that it can occur without having to use such things as timers. See Also See Recipe 8.8 for Example 8-2. Speaking of the state of technology, Recipe 20.3 introduces the new HTML5 history object  method,  pushState,  and  associated  window.onpopevent  event  handler.  These maintain state and were created to help resolve the back button problem mentioned in this recipe. Recipe 12.15 covers the setAttribute method.  8.9  Preserving State for Back Button, Page Refresh  157    CHAPTER 9 Form Elements and Validation  9.0  Introduction Outside of hypertext links, form elements were the very first form of interaction between web developers and web page readers, and were also one of the first reasons for interest in a scripting language. With the advent of JavaScript, form elements could be validated before the data was sent to the server, saving the reader time and the website extra processing. JavaScript can also be used to modify form elements based on the data the web reader provides, such as filling a selection list with the names of cities when a certain state is selected. The important point to remember when using JavaScript with form elements is that people turn JavaScript off, so it can’t be a dependency for any form action. JavaScript enhances, not replaces.  Though validating the form on the client can save a round trip, as a sound design practice, you’ll still want to validate the data on the server.  9.1  Accessing Form Text Input Values Problem You need to access the contents of a text input form element using JavaScript. Solution Use the DOM to access the form element:  var formValue = document.forms["formname"].elements["elementname"]. value;  159   Discussion Forms  in  a  web  page  can  be  accessed  through  an  object  collection   forms   via  the document object. Each form has its own collection  elements  of form elements. Accessing the form element’s value varies, based on the type of form element. For in- stance, a text input or textarea form element’s value can be accessed using the value attribute. To access the following form input element’s data:         use the following JavaScript:  txtValue = document.forms["textsearch"].elements "pattern"].value;  As demonstrated earlier in the book, you can also access the input form element directly, via its identifier:  var txtValue = document.getElementByid "pattern" .value;  However, when you’re working with a larger form, you’re more likely going to want to work with the DOM Level 0 form collections, in order to be consistent. You can also access the form element using an integer representing the form and the element’s position in the page. The first form that appears in the page is given an array index of zero, the second an index of one, and so on. The same with the elements. So to access the example form element, use the following:  var txtValue = document.forms[0].elements[1].value;  Using an array index is tricky, since it may be difficult to determine the location of a specific form and element. In addition, adding a new form or element can make for incorrect JavaScript, or a web page application that doesn’t perform as expected. How- ever, it’s also a simple way to process all form elements in a loop: while  var i = 0; i < document.forms[0].elements.length; i++  {    var val = document.forms[0].elements[i].value; }  Whenever you’re accessing data from a text or other field where the user can input whatever value he wants, before sending to the database or displaying in the page, you will want to strip or encode any harmful SQL, markup, or script that may be embedded in the value. You can use encodeURI and encodeURIComponent in JavaScript for encoding.  See Also See Recipe 2.4 for another demonstration of accessing a form and elements.  160  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   The solution uses the ECMAScript Binding for the DOM Level 2 HTML API, which can  be  found  at  http:  www.w3.org TR DOM-Level-2-HTML ecma-script-binding .html. For more on how to secure form input and the challenges of input security, read Jeff Atwood’s “Protecting Your Cookies: HttpOnly”.  9.2  Dynamically Disabling and Enabling Form Elements Problem Based  on  some  action  or  event,  you  want  to  disable,  or  enable,  one  or  more  form elements. Solution Use the disabled property to enable or disable form element s , accessing the element via the forms elements collections:  document.forms["formname"].elements["elementname"].disabled=true;  or via direct access to an element with an identifier:  document.getElementById "elementname" .disabled=true;  Discussion It’s not unusual to disable some fields in a form until information is provided or a specific event occurs. An example would be clicking a radio button enabling or disabling other form elements, such as input text fields. See Also See Recipe 9.4 for an example of clicking radio buttons and enabling or disabling spe- cific form elements. See Recipe 9.8 for another approach to providing access to form elements based on activity  hiding or showing form elements .  9.3  Getting Information from a Form Element Based on an Event Problem You need to access information from a form element after an event. Solution Depending on the form element, you can capture any number of events, and based on the event, process the form element data.  9.3  Getting Information from a Form Element Based on an Event   161   If you want to validate a form field after the data in the field has changed, you can assign a function to the onchange event handler function for the element:  document.getElementById "input1" .onchange=textChanged;  In the related function, access the form element’s value:  var value = this.value;  You can also attach a function to a form element based on whether it gets or loses focus, using the onfocus and onblur event handlers. The onblur event handler can be handy if you want to ensure a form field has data:  document.getElementById "input2" .onblur=checkValue;  In the function that checks to ensure some value is provided, you’ll first need to trim any whitespace. Since the String trim method is not supported in IE8, the following code  uses  a  variation  of  the  regular  expression  String.replace  method  covered  in Chapter 2:  var val = this.value; val = val.replace  ^\s\s* , '' .replace  \s\s*$ , ''  if  val.length == 0  alert "need value!" ;  You can capture keyboard events for form elements, such as onkeypress for a checkbox, but a click event is triggered for most form elements whether the element is clicked on by a mouse or the spacebar is clicked when the element has keyboard focus:  document.getElementById "check1" .onclick=getCheck;  In the function, you can then access the checkbox checked property:  var checked = this.checked; if  checked  { ...}  Discussion There are several different events based on the type of form element. Each can be cap- tured, and the appropriate event handler assigned a function. Table 9-1 contains a list of form elements and the events most commonly captured for the element.  Table 9-1. Form elements and commonly occurring events  Elements button, submit checkbox  radiobutton  textarea password, text selection  Events click, keypress, focus, blur click, keypress click, keypress select, change, focus, blur, click, keypress, mousedown, mouseup, keydown, keyup change, focus, blur, keypress, select change, focus, blur  162  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   Elements file  Events change, focus, blur  The list of elements isn’t exhaustive, nor is the list of events, but this gives you an idea of the more commonly occurring form element event pairings. In the form event handler function, you can access both the event and the element to get information about both. How you do this depends on your browser, and also how you assign the events. For instance, if you use the DOM Level 0 event handling in which you assign the event handler function directly to the event handler property: document.getElementById "button1" .onclick=handleClick;  In all browsers, you can access the element using the element context this. However, if you use DOM Level 2 and up event handling, such as the following function, which provides cross-browser event handling:  function listenEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } else {       eventObj["on" + event] = eventHandler;    } }  You can access the element context with this for Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, but not for IE8. For IE8, you’ll have to access the element using the event object:  function handleClick evt  {       cross browser event access    evt = evt  window.evt;        cross browser element access    var elem;    if  evt.srcElement        elem = evt.srcElement;    else       elem = this;  See Also See Chapter 2 for using regular expressions with form elements, and Chapter 7 for more on event handling, including with form elements.  9.3  Getting Information from a Form Element Based on an Event   163   9.4  Performing an Action When a Radio Button Is Clicked Problem You want to perform an action based on which radio button is clicked. Solution Attach an  onclick event handler to each of the radio buttons; in the event handler function, perform whatever action you need:  window.onload=function   {   var radios = document.forms[0].elements["group1"];   for  var i = 0; i < radios.length; i++      radios[i].onclick=radioClicked; }  function RadioClicked   {     if  this.value == "one"  {       document.forms[0].elements["line_text"].disabled=true;    } }  Discussion One relatively common use for JavaScript is to modify form elements based on actions taken elsewhere in the form. For example, clicking a specific radio button may disable some elements, but enable others. To do this, you need to assign an event handler function to a form element’s event handler, and then find out information about the element that received the event. In the solution, a set of radio buttons with the name of group1 are accessed from the form, and the onclick event handler for each is assigned to a function named function RadioClicked. In the function, properties associated with the clicked radio button are accessible via this, which is a proxy for the owner of the event. Via this, we can find out information about the event’s owner, including the type of element receiving the event  “radio” , the tagName  “input” , and the value  “one” . With this information, we can determine which of the radio buttons was clicked, and perform whatever action we need based on this information. One action associated with radio buttons is to enable or disable other form elements when one or another of the radio buttons is clicked. Example 9-1 shows a more com- plete demonstration of this type of activity. In the example, three radio buttons are paired with three text input fields. All three text input fields are disabled when the web page is loaded. Clicking any one of the radio buttons enables one input field and dis- ables the other two.  164  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   Example 9-1. Disabling enabling input elements based on a clicked radio button       Radio Click Pick     :enabled {     border: 4px solid ff0000;     padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; }  :disabled {     border: 2px solid cccccc; }       window.onload=function   {       first, disable all the input fields   document.forms[0].elements["intext"].disabled=true;   document.forms[0].elements["intext2"].disabled=true;   document.forms[0].elements["intext3"].disabled=true;       next, attach the click event handler to the radio buttons   var radios = document.forms[0].elements["group1"];   for  var i = [0]; i < radios.length; i++      radios[i].onclick=radioClicked; } function radioClicked   {       find out which radio button was clicked and      disable enable appropriate input elements   switch this.value  {     case "one" :        document.forms[0].elements["intext"].disabled=false;        document.forms[0].elements["intext2"].disabled=true;        document.forms[0].elements["intext3"].disabled=true;        break;     case "two" :        document.forms[0].elements["intext2"].disabled=false;        document.forms[0].elements["intext"].disabled=true;        document.forms[0].elements["intext3"].disabled=true;        break;     case "three" :        document.forms[0].elements["intext3"].disabled=false;        document.forms[0].elements["intext"].disabled=true;        document.forms[0].elements["intext2"].disabled=true;        break;   }  }     9.4  Performing an Action When a Radio Button Is Clicked  165         Group 1:    Group 2:    Group 3:                 The nonassociated text input fields are disabled with each new clicked event, in order to clear previous activity. In addition, to add a little flair to the example, new CSS3 functionality to style enabled and disabled attributes is used in the example, as shown in Figure 9-1. The CSS3 setting works with all of the book target browsers except IE8.  Figure 9-1.

Solution Access the form field value, and then use a regular expression to validate the format. To validate a U.S.-based phone number  area + prefix + digits :  166  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation      filter out anything but numbers to    standardize input var phone = document.forms[0].elements["intext"].value; var re =  \D+ g; var cleanphone = phone.replace re,"" ;     check length if  cleanphone.length < 10  alert "bad phone" ;  Discussion To validate form fields, you need to strip out any extraneous material first, and then test only what is necessary. Phone numbers can be provided using different formats:   314  555-1212 314-555-1212 314.555.1212 3145551212  All you really need are the numbers; everything else is just syntactic sugar. To validate a phone number, strip out anything that isn’t a number, and then check the length, as shown in the solution. Once validated, you can then reformat into a standard format, though usually if you’re going to store a phone number in a database, you want to store it in the smallest form possible  all numbers . Another way to ensure that the data is correct is to provide three fields for the number, and only allow the number of characters for each field  3-3-4 . But it’s probably simpler for you and for your users to use just one field. See Also There are any number of regular expression formulas that work for various validation purposes. See more on regular expressions in Chapter 2. Also note that many JavaScript frameworks and libraries provide simple-to-use validation routines, where all you have to do is give each input element a class name or some other indicator in order to trigger proper validation. See Recipe 14.2 for integrating accessibility into your forms using ARIA.  9.6  Canceling a Form Submission Problem You want to cancel a form submission if you find the data entered into the form fields invalid.  9.6  Canceling a Form Submission  167   Solution If the form fields don’t validate, cancel the form submission event using the technique appropriate to the event handling technique you’re using. Here, we’re borrowing from Chapter 7  where we covered events :     listen to an event function listenEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } else {       eventObj["on" + event] = eventHandler;    } }     cancel event function  cancelEvent  event  {    if  event.preventDefault  {       event.preventDefault  ;    } else {       event.returnValue = false;    } }  window.onload=function   {    var form = document.forms["picker"];    listenEvent form,"submit",validateFields ; }  function validateFields evt  {    evt = evt ? evt : window.event;    ...     if  invalid  {       cancelEvent evt ;    } }  Discussion In the same function you use to validate the form field s , cancel the event. In the event function, the cancelEvent function checks to see if the preventDefault method is sup- ported. If it is, it’s called. If not, the event’s returnValue is set to false  cancel event . See Also See Chapter 7 for more information on event handling.  168  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   9.7  Preventing Duplicate Form Submissions Problem Potential harm could occur if a user submits the same form multiple times. You want to prevent duplicate form submissions. Solution One approach is to provide a message that the form has been submitted, and then provide some means to prevent the web page reader from submitting the form again. In its simplest variation, the following would work:  function validateSubmission evt  { ... alert "Thank you, we're processing your order right now" ; document.getElementById "submitbutton" .disabled=true;    disable  Discussion Multiple concurrent form submissions are one of the worst problems that can occur in a user interface. Most people would be unhappy if, say, they found they had purchased two of the same item when they were only expecting to purchase one. There are several different approaches you can take to prevent duplicate form submis- sions,  and  how  strict  you  want  to  be  depends  on  the  seriousness  of  the  double submission. For example, comment forms don’t usually restrict form submission. Duplicate sub- missions may result in a message that duplicate comments have posted, and the first has been rejected. Even if the duplicate comment is posted, it’s a minor nuisance, rather than a serious problem. However, it’s essential to prevent duplicate form submission with any kind of store- front, and anything that could result in unexpected charges to your web customers. If you do restrict duplicate form submissions, provide some form of feedback to the customer. In the solution, I took a simple approach, popping up a message providing feedback to the users that the form has been submitted, and then disabling the submit button so they can’t click it again. It’s an OK approach, but we can take the security a little further. Instead of a pop up, we can embed a message directly into the page. Instead of just disabling the submit button, we can also use a flag to doubly ensure that a submission can’t be initiated while an existing form submission is being processed. Example 9-2 demonstrates a safer way to prevent duplicate form submissions.  9.7  Preventing Duplicate Form Submissions   169   Example 9-2. Demonstrating prevention of duplicate form submissions         Prevent Duplication Form Submission     refresh {    display: none;    width: 200px; height: 20px;    background-color: ffff00; }       <![CDATA[  var inprocess=false;  window.onload=function   {    document.forms["picker"].onsubmit=validateSubmit;    document.getElementById "refresh" .onclick=startOver; }  function validateSubmit   {       prevent duplicate form submission   if  inprocess  return;   inprocess=true;   document.getElementById "submitbutton" .disabled=true;       for example only   document.getElementById "refresh" .style.display="block";   document.getElementById "message" .innerHTML= " We're now processing your request, which can take a minute. ";       validation stuff   return false; }  function startOver   {    inprocess=false;    document.getElementById "submitbutton" .disabled=false;    document.getElementById "message" .innerHTML="";    document.getElementById "refresh" .style.display="none"; }   -->          Group 1:   Group 2:   Group 3:       170  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   Input 1:   Input 2:   Input 3:            Click to reset example             If you load the example into a browser and click the Send Form button, it will become disabled and two new elements will display: a processing message and a button to refresh the page. The latter is included only because this is an example, as a way to reset the example. Normally, in a form, a post-processing web page will display with a confirmation of the action and a message of thanks, or whatever is appropriate. If Ajax is used to make the update, the form can be reenabled once the Ajax processing is complete.  9.8  Hiding and Displaying Form Elements Problem You want to hide form elements until some event. Solution Surround the form elements that will be hidden with a div element:    Item 1:   Item 2:   Item 3:        Input 1:   Input 2:   Input 3:            Change the div’s display to none when the page loads:  window.onload=function   {    document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="none";        attach the click event handler to the radio buttons  9.8  Hiding and Displaying Form Elements   171     var radios = document.forms[0].elements["group1"];   for  var i = [0]; i < radios.length; i++      radios[i].onclick=radioClicked; }  When the event to display the form elements occurs, change the div element’s display so that the form elements are displayed:  function radioClicked   {    if  this.value == "two"  {     document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="block";    } else {     document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="none";    } }  Discussion In the solution, the hidden form elements are surrounded by a div element in order to make it easier to work with them as a group. However, you could also control the display for elements individually. The CSS display property allows you to completely remove elements from the page  display="none" , as shown in Figure 9-2. This makes it an ideal CSS property to use; the visibility property will only hide the elements, but it doesn’t remove them from the display. If you used visibility, you’d have a gap between the displayed elements and the form button.  Figure 9-2. Page with form elements removed from display  In the solution, clicking the second radio button displays the input fields, as shown in Figure 9-3. Notice in the code that if you click on the first or third radio button, the  172  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   display for the hidden elements is set to none, just in case it is currently displayed after a previous second radio button selection. You always want to take into account the state of the page whenever you’re processing an event that changes the makeup of a form. If certain elements are only displayed for given form values, then any activity in the form should either check the current state of the form or just reissue either the hide or show functionality, because it doesn’t hurt to reshow a shown element or rehide one already hidden.  Figure 9-3. Page with hidden form elements displayed  See Also See a full-page example of the hidden displayed form element example in Recipe 10.1  Example 10-1 .  9.9  Modifying a Selection List Based on Other Form Decisions Problem You want to modify the contents of a second selection list based on the choice made in a first selection list. Solution You have two options when it comes to modifying the contents of one selection list, based on the choice in another selection list. The first is to query a database and build the selection list based on the choice. This is demonstrated in Recipe 18.9, which covers Ajax.  9.9  Modifying a Selection List Based on Other Form Decisions   173   The second approach is to maintain a static copy of the second selection list options:  var citystore = new Array  ; citystore[0] = ['CA','San Francisco']; citystore[1] = ['CA','Los Angeles']; citystore[2] = ['CA','San Diego']; citystore[3] = ['MO','St. Louis']; citystore[4] = ['MO','Kansas City']; citystore[5] = ['WA','Seattle']; citystore[6] = ['WA','Spokane']; citystore[7] = ['WA','Redmond'];   And use this copy to rebuild the selection list: function filterCities   {   var state = this.value;   var city = document.getElementById 'cities' ;   city.options.length=0;    for  var i = 0; i < citystore.length; i++  {     var st = citystore[i][0];     if  st == state  {       var opt = new Option citystore[i][1] ;       try {         city.add opt,null ;       } catch e  {         city.add opt ;       }     }   } }  Discussion Selection lists are often built from direct database queries. To prevent the lists from being too large, they may be built based on choices in other form elements, from an Ajax-enabled query, an array, or even a hidden selection list. As the solution demonstrates, regardless of approach, the simplest and quickest way to populate the selection list is to first set the options array list to zero, which deletes everything from the list; then go through the available option data, and based on what- ever criteria, create new options with the option data and append to the empty selection list. To see this type of functionality in action, Example 9-3 shows an entire application that incorporates the code in the solution. Clicking a state will populate the second selection list with cities for that state. A try...catch block is used when adding the new option to the selection list, because IE8 does not support the second parameter for the ele- ment’s position in the add method. If the first add method fails, the second is used.  Example 9-3. Populating a selection list         174  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation    Populating Selection Lists      <![CDATA[  var citystore = new Array  ; citystore[0] = ['CA','San Francisco']; citystore[1] = ['CA','Los Angeles']; citystore[2] = ['CA','San Diego']; citystore[3] = ['MO','St. Louis']; citystore[4] = ['MO','Kansas City']; citystore[5] = ['WA','Seattle']; citystore[6] = ['WA','Spokane']; citystore[7] = ['WA','Redmond'];  window.onload=function   {   document.getElementById "state" .onchange=filterCities; }  function filterCities   {   var state = this.value;   var city = document.getElementById 'cities' ;   city.options.length=0;    for  var i = 0; i < citystore.length; i++  {     var st = citystore[i][0];     if  st == state  {       var opt = new Option citystore[i][1] ;       try {         city.add opt,null ;       } catch e  {         city.add opt ;       }     }   } }    -->             --   Missouri   Washington   California               9.9  Modifying a Selection List Based on Other Form Decisions   175   If scripting is disabled in an application like this one, the best option is to hide the city selection list by default and display a button  again by default  that submits the form and populates the city selection on a second page. See Also See Recipe 18.9 for a demonstration of using Ajax to populate a selection list. More on the try...catch error handling in Recipe 10.4.  176  Chapter 9: Form Elements and Validation   CHAPTER 10 Debugging and Error Handling  10.0  Introduction It  would  be  wonderful  if  we  could,  by  some  miracle,  manage  to  create  JavaScript applications that never fail, never have errors, never go wrong. Then we would have perfection and wouldn’t need things like debuggers and error handling. But what would be the fun in that? There are two types of errors in JavaScript. The first is a programming error, where we, the  JavaScript  developers,  do  something  wrong.  These  types  of  errors  are  typically found using our favorite browser and our favorite debugger. At a minimum, what we need from a debugger is the ability to stop program execution and then examine variables and objects at that point. It also helps if we can continue the program by steps, drill into functions, and examine network activity and the state of the DOM at any time. However, we can usually manage debugging if we have the ability to stop a program and examine object values. The second type of error occurs when the web page reader answers a question incor- rectly, pushes the wrong button, or tries to type in a Social Security number when we’re expecting a name. Or the error can happen when we’re mixing libraries and something goes wrong between them. We’ll look at these kinds of errors first, and then we’ll get into the various browsers and their debugging capabilities.  10.1  Gracefully Handling No JavaScript Support Problem You want to ensure your pages work as well with JavaScript turned off as when it’s turned on.  177   Solution One approach is to the use the noscript element to provide alternative functionality:    document.writeln " Some content " ;     Fall back account    However, more modern applications make an assumption that JavaScript is turned off, and ensure the page works correctly script-free. Once that’s taken care of, we add script to make the page more interactive. Discussion Several years ago, it wasn’t uncommon to find script blocks scattered about a page, generating web page content on the fly. To ensure that something showed up even if scripting was turned off, the developers would match the script with a noscript ele- ment. This noscript element would provide fallback page content or information. The noscript element has gone out of favor, and is listed as obsolete in HTML5. Now, web developers create the entire page and all of its content without any scripting enabled. Then, and only then, they’ll add script to make the page more helpful, interactive, or even fun. For example, a web page can have several form elements. It’s workable, but having many form elements can take up a lot of space. However, the form elements have to be available if scripting is turned off. To solve the problem, the developer can style the form elements to be displayed by default, and then use JavaScript to turn off the display of some of the elements when the page loads. Based on the web page reader’s actions, form elements will be displayed and hidden as needed. This ensures that the form elements are always available and only hidden when support for scripting is ensured. Example  10-1  shows  a  very  simple  implementation  of  this  type  of  functionality.  If scripting is turned off, all of the form elements display by default. If scripting is turned on, however, the text input elements in the lower part of the form are hidden when the page  is  loaded   note  emphasized  code ,  and  only  displayed  when  the  second  radio button is clicked.  Example 10-1. Form elements set to display by default if scripting is disabled, hidden if scripting is enabled         Hide Show          <![CDATA[  178  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   var inprocess=false;  window.onload=function   {    document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="none";        attach the click event handler to the radio buttons   var radios = document.forms[0].elements["group1"];   for  var i = [0]; i < radios.length; i++      radios[i].onclick=radioClicked; }  function radioClicked   {    if  this.value == "two"  {     document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="block";    } else {     document.getElementById "hidden_elements" .style.display="none";    } }    -->          Item 1:   Item 2:   Item 3:        Input 1:   Input 2:   Input 3:                Figure 10-1 shows what the page looks like if scripting is disabled, and Figure 10-2 shows what the page looks like with scripting enabled.  Figure 10-1. Page as it is displayed with scripting disabled  10.1  Gracefully Handling No JavaScript Support   179   Figure 10-2. Page with scripting enabled  This concept of adding scripting after the page is fully constructed is known  as  progressive  enhancement.  It  was  the  brain  child  of  Steven Champeon of http:  hesketh.com.  See Also There are several good articles on progressive enhancement. You can start with:    “Progressive Enhancement: Paving the Way for Future Web Design”   “Understanding Progressive Enhancement”   “Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, and How to Use It?”  To ensure the accessibility of this effect, check out the use of ARIA in Chapter 14.  10.2  Checking for Errors in Functions Problem You want to signal to the calling application that an error happened in a function. Solution The simplest approach to signaling an error in a function is through the returned result:  function sumNumbers numArray  {   var result = 0;       sum numbers in array      unless array is empty, or nonnumber reached   if  numArray.length > 0  {     for  var i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++  {       if  typeof numArray[i] == "number"  {         result+=numArray[i];       }       else {         result = NaN;         break;       }     }  180  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling     }   else {      result = NaN;   }   return result; } ...   var ary = new Array 1,15,"three",5,5 ;   var res = sumNumbers ary ;    res is NaN   if  isNaN res   alert "Encountered a bad array or array element" ;  Discussion A simple way to return an error from a function is through the result. The important point to remember is that the return value and type need to match what you would expect from the data type of the result if things had gone well. In the solution, the global NaN value is returned if the array was empty, or has at least one entry that isn’t a number. The result is tested with the isNaN function, and if the result is NaN, a message to that effect is given.  10.3  Using an Alert for Simple Debugging Problem You want a simple way to check the value of a variable. Solution Use an alert message box to output the value of a variable:  alert someVariable ;  Discussion Most developers use what I call the poor man’s debugging tool: printing out the value of a variable using whatever output functionality is available. With JavaScript, the poor man’s debugging usually occurs through an alert message box or with the JavaScript console, if the console is supported by the browser. To use an alert message box to debug, just provide the variable in the function call:  alert variableName ;  If the variable is a simple scalar value, the result of this function call is a printout of the string value of the object’s contents. If the object is more complex, the print results will vary. For instance, an array will have a print out value like the following:  var fruit = ['apple','cherry','pear']; alert fruit ;    prints out apple, cherry, pear  The array values are all printed out, in order, with a comma between the entries.  10.3  Using an Alert for Simple Debugging  181   Using an object with the alert can have interesting effects. If you pass a variable con- taining a reference to a web page element, you may get unpredictable results depending on the browser used, its age, the DOM the browser supports, and so on. For the most part, though, and for most web page elements, the object printouts will be the same. In Safari 4, a variable with a reference to a div element:  alert divElement ;  prints out as:  [object HTMLDivElement]  Not particularly useful. However, the following could provide useful information:  alert divElement.innerHTML ;    prints out contents of div element  Anything beyond these simple printouts, though, should be left for browser debuggers.  10.4  Catching an Error and Providing Graceful Error Handling Problem You want to incorporate helpful error handling into your JavaScript. Solution Use the try...catch exception handling technique:  try {   someFunction var1 ; } catch  e  {   alert  e.message ; } finally {   j = null; }  Discussion In the solution, the code accesses a function that hasn’t been defined. Normally, this would trigger a JavaScript error, resulting in an error message like that shown in the Firefox JavaScript console in Figure 10-3. It would also cause the script to fail at that point. It’s an effective error-handling mechanism, but not a particularly graceful or helpful one. When the code that could result in an error is contained in a try statement, the asso- ciated catch statement handles the exception it causes. After the error is processed, the program control then skips to the first statement that follows the exception handling statements.  182  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-3. Firefox console error when accessing a nonexistent function  You can also use an optional finally statement with code that you want to process regardless  of  the  success  of  the  try  statement.  You’ll  most  likely  want  to  use  the finally statement to do any necessary cleanup. The exception in the solution is an Error object, and it comes with useful information. In the solution, the error message is accessed and printed out to an alert message box. Peering into the exception in Firefox, we find the following properties:  fileName  lineNumber  message  name  stack  Name of file where exception occurred  Number of the line where exception occurred  The exception message  The name of the exception  i.e., ReferenceError   A stack trace of the exception  The fileName, lineNumber, and stack are nonstandard Firefox extensions and aren’t guaranteed to exist between browsers. The message and error name are standard, and should always be available if the application or browser implements JavaScript excep- tion handling.  10.4  Catching an Error and Providing Graceful Error Handling  183   10.5  Initiating Manageable Errors Problem You want to incorporate custom exceptions into your applications or libraries that provide useful information to calling applications. Solution Use the throw statement, and create a custom object as an exception:  if  typeof value == "number"  {     sum+=number; } else {    throw "NotANumber"; }  Discussion The throw statement is partner to try...catch. With throw, you can throw exceptions rather than returning error values from functions or setting some global error value. The advantage to using throw and try...catch is that it doesn’t matter how deeply nested the error occurs, as the exception can ensure that the error is reflected to the calling application, and cleanly, too. In the solution, the exception is thrown as a string. You can also throw an integer, Boolean, or object. If you only need to provide an exception message, use the string— or an integer if you’re using an array of exceptions, and the integer is used to look up the  error.  Otherwise,  either  create  and  throw  a  specific  exception,  or  create  a  new Error object, providing your own error message:  if  typeof value == "number"  {     sum+=number; } else {    throw new Error "NotANumber" ; }  The existing exception types are Error, as demonstrated, and:  Used when eval is used improperly  Used when the number is out of range  EvalError  RangeError  ReferenceError  SyntaxError  Used when a nonexistent variable is referenced  Used when there’s a syntax error  184  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   TypeError  URIError  Indicates an unexpected type  Used when a malformed URI is encountered  DOMException  Indicates a DOM error  EventException  RangeException  Indicates a DOM event exception  Indicates a DOM range exception  The last three exceptions are related to the DOM API. All the errors take a custom message as a string parameter.  10.6  Using Firebug with Firefox Problem You want to set up Firefox for debugging JavaScript. Solution Use Firebug, the popular Firefox add-on development tool. Discussion Unlike  other  development  tools,  Firebug  is  a  Firefox  add-on,  which  you’ll  need  to download and install. However, it installs very easily, and new releases update through Firefox automatically. To start Firebug, look for the little bug in the status bar, on the right of the browser. Clicking the bug opens Firebug, as shown in Figure 10-4. The Firebug tab pages include the Console, the HTML element inspector, the CSS panel, the Script tab, the DOM tree tab, and the Net tab. The Net tab will be handy later in the book when we’re working with Ajax, but for now, we’ll take a look at the HTML, DOM, and CSS tabs before going into more detail on the Script debugger and Console.  10.6  Using Firebug with Firefox  185   Figure 10-4. The Firebug tabbed pages  In the HTML tab, you can view the page’s element tree, clicking any element in the tree to highlight the element in the page, as shown in Figure 10-5. Notice the Style, Layout, and DOM options in the right panel. The Layout tab is currently checked, and shows the width, borders, and padding. The HTML tab is a good way to check your web page to see which element you need to access or modify with your JavaScript application. The CSS tab shows the CSS currently set for the web page. You can also edit the CSS by clicking the Edit option, as shown in Figure 10-6. Again, handy if you’re setting CSS to work with your JavaScript application. If there is more than one CSS stylesheet, you can select which one to display from a drop-down menu. The DOM inspector provides descriptions of the DOM for all of the page elements. This includes all the properties and methods, which makes a terrific in-page reference for all the functionality you need when you’re building your dynamic page applications, as shown in Figure 10-7. If the Panels are not enabled when you open Firebug, you can enable them by right- clicking the little Firebug icon in the status bar. Once they are enabled, you can control what shows up in each panel with drop-down menus.  186  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-5. The Firebug HTML tab, with the Layout option selected  Figure 10-6. The Firebug CSS tab, with editing turned on  10.6  Using Firebug with Firefox  187   Figure 10-7. The Firebug DOM inspector  You can also open Firebug in a separate window, via the Firebug icon menu. Opening the debugger in a separate window is handy if you don’t want to take up page real estate with a debugger. See Also Download Firebug from http:  getfirebug.com . Estelle Weyl wrote a nice tutorial on Firebug at http:  www.evotech.net blog 2007 06 introduction-to-firebug . There’s also a Firebug Lite for use with other browsers, but I’ve found that each browser’s one native debugger to be sufficient. If you want to try it, though, download it from http:  getfire bug.com lite.html.  10.7  Setting a Breakpoint and Examining Data with Firebug Problem You want to stop program execution in Firefox and check out the program variables at the time. Solution Set a breakpoint in Firebug and use the Watch Expression panel to examine the data.  188  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Discussion JavaScript breakpoints can be set by clicking the line where you want the breakpoint to be set, as shown in Figure 10-8.  Figure 10-8. Setting a breakpoint in Firebug  In Figure 10-8, a dark box surrounds the debugging flow controls. From left to right, the first control continues execution of the program until another breakpoint, or the application ends. The next control is Step Into, which causes the debugger to drill into any function. The next is Step Over, which would step over a function. The last is Step Out, to step out of a function. When you set a breakpoint, you can set it to stop the program execution every time the line is reached, or you can specify a constraint by right-clicking the breakpoint and providing a constraint on the breakpoint, as shown in Figure 10-9. Most of the time, though, you’ll probably want to stop execution with each iteration. When a breakpoint is reached in Firebug, you can examine the Watch expressions, variables, and objects, the execution stack, or where current breakpoints are set  handy for very large applications  in the left panel.  10.7  Setting a Breakpoint and Examining Data with Firebug  189   Figure 10-9. Setting a conditional breakpoint in Firebug  Figure 10-10 shows the Watch panel open, with several objects showing. If any of the variables have a drop-down arrow next to it, clicking the arrow displays any properties and methods of the object directly beneath the object. As you step through program execution, the objects are updated according to the program.  10.8  Firefox and the Console Problem You want to profile a JavaScript application’s performance in Firefox. Solution Use Firebug and the Console commands to profile the JavaScript application. Discussion The Firebug Console object, its associated panel, and its API, are handy not only for JavaScript profiling, but for program logging, performing a trace, and other debugging.  190  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-10. Examining watch expressions in Firebug after the breakpoint is reached  When the Console panel is enabled in Firebug, there’s a drop-down menu at the top of the panel that controls what shows up in the Console, such as CSS and XML errors, whether to turn on strict warnings, or to open a larger command line. The command line is a small line at the bottom of the Console panel, as shown in Figure 10-11. The Console command line is a way to enter Console commands  naturally . The com- mand line isn’t for the inexperienced, but it can be a quick way to work your way around the DOM. It also has an “autofill” capability: if you start to type in a DOM element, as shown in Figure 10-12, and hit the tab, you can cycle through options at any point, hitting the return when you find one you want. Returning to the solution, to profile JavaScript, you’ll use the Console object API, not the Command Line API. The Console object API is actually controlled in your Java- Script, with commands given directly in the script. For instance, to start a JavaScript profile and give it a name of test, use the following:  console.profile 'test' ;  When you want to finish the profile, use:  console.profileEnd  ;  10.8  Firefox and the Console  191   Figure 10-11. The Firebug Console, including command line  Figure 10-12. Using the Firebug Console command line  192  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   In the profile tab for the Console panel, you can see the named profiles, and if you click on each, see where time was spent in the application, as shown in Figure 10-13.  Figure 10-13. Using the Console object’s profile methods to profile the JavaScript  There are other Console object API methods, including console.log to log messages, console.count, which prints out the number of times the line with this command is executed, console.time and console.timeEnd, to set up a timer to test execution time for a block of code, and so on. Best of all, as we’ll see later, other browser debuggers have also implemented at least partial support for the Console API.  As with all debugging aids built into an application, make sure you re- move console inline code commands before rolling your application out for beta or release.  See Also The Console command line documentation can be found at http:  getfirebug.com cl .html,  and  the  command  line  API  at  http:  getfirebug.com wiki index.php Command  10.8  Firefox and the Console  193   _Line. The console object API documentation can be found at http:  getfirebug.com  wiki index.php Console.  10.9  Using IE’s Built-in Debugger Problem You’re using Internet Explorer and you want to debug your JavaScript application.  You need to turn on the IE Developer Tools. Solution The  Developer  Tools,  including  a  JavaScript  debugger,  can  be  found  under Tools→Developer Tools, or by pressing F12, as shown in Figure 10-14.  Figure 10-14. Finding the Developer Tools in IE8  Discussion The Developer Tools that come with IE8 are as featured as you would need and provide tabbed panels for inspecting HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript application Profil- ing, as shown in Figure 10-15. Don’t let references to “JScript” intimidate you: this is Microsoft’s term for JavaScript, but is more or less the same thing as “JavaScript” or even “ECMAScript” to everyone else.  194  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-15. The IE Developer Tools interface  The HTML and CSS Developer Tools provide displays of HTML or CSS for the current web page. In the left panel is a display of markup or CSS for the page, and if you click on an object, properties for what you clicked display in the right panel. As with Firebug, you can examine the layout for the page or the CSS attributes for an element. You can modify both or choose a new stylesheet, and save any edits to a new HTML or CSS file. The Profile panel is a great way of testing your web page and ap- plication performance to see where a script may be dragging, as shown in Figure 10-16.  Figure 10-16. Using the IE Developer Tools profile feature  10.9  Using IE’s Built-in Debugger   195   Microsoft does support a Console API, but be forewarned: it does not operate the same as the Console API defined with Firebug and also used by WebKit. It’s only available when typing script into the Console pane; you can’t use it within the actual script itself. Handy, but not as handy as being able to place console calls into the code itself. As for the Console pane, Figure 10-17 shows it open, with errors displayed.  Figure 10-17. Examining JavaScript errors in the IE Developer Tools Console pane  See Also Microsoft provides good documentation of the IE Developer Tools at http:  msdn.mi crosoft.com en-us library dd565622 VS.85 .aspx.  Be  aware,  though,  that  Microsoft moves pages around a lot, and doesn’t provide redirection in most cases. If the link provided in this book dies, try searching for “IE8 Developer Tools” to find the docu- mentation. The high-level IE Developer page is at http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us ie  default.aspx. This will probably be a safe URL.  10.10  Setting a Breakpoint with IE Developer Tools Problem You want to halt execution of a JavaScript application at specific lines, and examine the application data at that point.  196  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Solution Use the IE Developer Tools Script debugger to set breakpoints in your code and then examine the data, as well as the Call Stack and Watch expressions in the right side of the script debugger. Discussion The IE Developer Tools Script debugger isn’t turned on until you do so explicitly, or you hit an error in the JavaScript and the browser asks if you want to debug the script. When you open the script, you can set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line where you want the breakpoint to stop, as shown in Figure 10-18.  Figure 10-18. The Script Debugger with a breakpoint set and code execution stopped  Next to the Start Stop Debugging button shown in Figure 10-18, you can see the op- tions that control program flow  Step Into, Step Over, Step Out . In the right side of the debugger is a display of the local variables at that point in the code execution. Currently the Event object is open, and all of its properties and methods are displayed. Clicking any of the methods or properties that have a plus  +  next to the name pops open the additional properties and methods nested next to the property, as shown in Figure 10-19. This nesting is typical for all of the debuggers. Otherwise, the displays could get too cluttered to see what’s happening.  10.10  Setting a Breakpoint with IE Developer Tools   197   Figure 10-19. The Script Debugger Locals panel with additional properties displayed below their parent element or object  10.11  Opera’s Dragonfly Problem Your favorite browser is Opera and you want to see what kind of debugging capability this browser has. Solution Use Opera’s Dragonfly for JavaScript and other debugging. Discussion I will say one thing: Opera has the prettiest named debugger. As with most of the browsers these days, Dragonfly is built into Opera. You can access the tool by selecting the Tools menu, then Advanced, and Developer Tools. Dragonfly opens in the bottom half of the web page, as shown in Figure 10-20. As with Firebug and IE’s Developer Tools, Dragonfly provides a panel for examining and working with HTML  DOM , an Error Console, a place to control the settings for the tool, a Network page, and a script debugger. The Settings panel is rather nice, because it’s quite simple to see where to make changes, as shown in Figure 10-21. The Error Console will show JavaScript errors, CSS errors, or both, as shown in Fig- ure 10-22. Unfortunately, at this time, Dragonfly does not support the Console API.  198  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-20. Opera’s Dragonfly opened into browser  Figure 10-21. Dragonfly’s Settings page  10.11  Opera’s Dragonfly  199   Figure 10-22. Showing both CSS and JavaScript errors in the Dragonfly Error Console  The Network page shows how long each component of the page took to load and the component’s size, as shown in Figure 10-23. Though not as colorful as Safari’s setup  as you’ll see later in this chapter , it’s nicely organized and easy to read. As with other developing tools  except for IE’s , you can unlock the Dragonfly frame into a separate window by clicking the double window icon next to the Dragonfly icon at the top of the pane. Clicking the Dragonfly icon reloads the debugging context, and clicking the red X closes Dragonfly. See Also Opera has provided a nice set of documentation for DragonFly at http:  www.opera .com dragonfly documentation .  200  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-23. Dragonfly’s Network page  10.12  Setting a Breakpoint with Dragonfly Problem You want to set a breakpoint and examine program state in Opera. Solution Use Dragonfly’s Scripts panel. Click the line to the left of where you want the breakpoint to be. As with all other debuggers, you have options at the top to continue script pro- cessing: Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out, as shown in Figure 10-24. Notice the right panel in Figure 10-24. Currently, it’s set to display the current call stack. You can click the Inspection tab to view local variables as they’re set while you walk through the code, as shown in Figure 10-25.  10.13  Turning on Safari’s Development Tools Problem You need to find the development tools available for Safari 4.  10.13  Turning on Safari’s Development Tools   201   Figure 10-24. Stopping at a breakpoint in Dragonfly  Figure 10-25. Inspecting local variables using Dragonfly  202  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Solution In the Preferences menu, select the Advanced option and check the option to “Show Develop menu” in menu bar. Discussion Safari 4 and up feature a wide variety of helpful tools for the web developer. Once you turn on the Develop menu, you’ll see options to:    Open the page in another browser   Change the User Agent signature to others, to test applications   Show Web Inspector   Show Error Console   Show Snippet Editor   Start Debugging JavaScript   Start Profiling JavaScript   Disable Caches   Disable Images   Disable Styles   Disable JavaScript   Disable Runaway JavaScript Timer   Disable Site-Specific Hacks  All of the options are handy, but I’ll focus on those useful for the JavaScript developer. The Show Web Inspector option opens the Web Inspector into the lower portion of the browser window. The Web Inspector is a terrific way of examining the page elements, as well as checking resource use for pages and debugging script, as shown in Figure 10-26. Moving your mouse over any of the elements shades the element in the page, making it easier to spot. The right window shows the current style setting for the element.  Most of the other options work within the Web Inspector, including the Error Console. The Show Error Console will open the Web Inspector if it’s not already opened, and then an error message at the bottom. The Error Console reflects all of the JavaScript errors that occur, including the line number where the error occurred, as shown in Figure 10-27.  The ability to open the page in another browser provides a nice way to quickly open a page for testing in one of the other browsers currently available in the system. The ability to change the User Agent string is a way of testing JavaScript applications and libraries to see if the code or behavior changes based on the user agent.  10.13  Turning on Safari’s Development Tools   203   Figure 10-26. The Web Inspector open in a Safari browser  Figure 10-27. The Error Console opened in the Web Inspector  The  Snippet  Editor  is  a  cute  little  bugger.  When  you  click  on  this  option,  a  small, double-paned window opens. You can type HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in the upper pane, and the result is displayed in the bottom pane. It’s a great way of trying out various pieces  of  markup  or  code,  without  having  to  create  a  web  page,  as  shown  in  Fig- ure 10-28.  204  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Figure 10-28. The Snippet Editor with a line of HTML and small piece of JavaScript  The JavaScript profile functionality provides information about where your application is spending its time. It is compatible with the console.profile methods described with Firefox, and provides a nice interface to view the results. Figure 10-29 demonstrates a profile of a small Canvas application. I’ll cover one last tool before getting into the JavaScript debugging in Safari: the resource window. Though not specific to JavaScript use, this handy window can provide you a good idea of why your pages may be loading slowly; it provides a breakdown of what’s loaded, and how long it’s taking. The resources tracked are JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and the document, as shown in Figure 10-30. See Also The Firefox JavaScript profile functionality is covered in Recipe 10.9.

Solution Set a breakpoint in Safari’s debugger, and when the breakpoint is reached, check out the program variables at that point. Discussion When the JavaScript debugger is open and JavaScript loaded, you can set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of the line number for the line where you want the breakpoint to occur, as shown in Figure 10-31.  Figure 10-31. Setting a breakpoint and examining local variables in the Safari debugger  As shown in Figure 10-31, when the breakpoint is reached, you can check out both local and global variables, including those for DOM elements, such as document. Click- ing the arrows next to any of the objects will open a display with the object’s methods and properties.  10.14  Setting a Breakpoint with Safari’s Debugger   207   Once you’ve reached the breakpoint, you can continue program execution by using the buttons above the data panel, as shown in Figure 10-32. From the left, the buttons represent the pause run button  to continue execution , and the Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out Of buttons for controlling how you want to handle function calls in a line. Typically, I use Step Over, because I don’t necessarily want to drill into a function: I want to see return values. However, it is a handy way of seeing what’s happening when you’re using JavaScript libraries.  Figure 10-32. The program execution control buttons over the data panel in the script debugger  Safari  or, I should say, WebKit  is the only browser that implements the console API made popular by Firebug. If you want to start a JavaScript profile in Safari, insert a console command to start the profile, as well as the end profile command. You can then check out the profile in the Profiles panel in the debugger, as shown in Recipe 10.12, in Figure 10-29.  10.15  Debugging in Chrome Problem You want to use a JavaScript debug tool in Google’s Chrome.  208  Chapter 10: Debugging and Error Handling   Solution The Developer Tools for Chrome are a little hard to find because of the user interface, but if you look under the Page icon on the menu bar, you’ll see an option labeled Developer. Clicking it displays several options, including Debug JavaScript and Java- Script Console. Clicking the Debug JavaScript option opens the Web Inspector, in- cluding JavaScript Developer. Discussion Chrome is based on WebKit, so the same web inspector and debugging tools made available in WebKit are also available in Chrome. Once you’ve turned on the debug option, you’ll see set of panels  as shown in Figure 10-33  that will look familiar if you’ve worked with recent versions of Safari.  Figure 10-33. The WebKit debugger toolset, open in Chrome  You can set breakpoints, examine data, inspect HTML and CSS, and create JavaScript profiles—basically, all of the functionality you expect from web developer tools. See Also The debugger for Chrome is the WebKit debugger, so I’ll refer you to Recipe 10.13, on how the debugger is used to debug JavaScript in Safari.  10.15  Debugging in Chrome  209    CHAPTER 11 Accessing Page Elements  11.0  Introduction A web document is organized like an upside-down tree, with the topmost element at the root and all other elements branching out, beneath. As you can see when you look at a web page within the Safari Web Developer Elements window  Figure 11-1 , the top-level element is the html element, followed by the head and body elements. The head element contains  title,  script, and  meta elements, while the body contains a couple of div elements, one containing paragraphs  p , the other containing an unor- dered list  ul  and list items  li —one of which contains a paragraph, which contains a span. Except for the root element  HTML , each element has a parent node, and all of the elements are accessible from one object: document. There are several different techniques available for accessing these document elements, or nodes as they’re called in the Document Object Model  DOM . Today, we access these nodes through standardized versions of the DOM, such as the DOM Levels 2 and 3, mentioned throughout the book. Originally, though, a de facto technique was to access the elements through the browser object model, sometimes referred to as DOM Level 0. The DOM Level 0 was invented by the leading browser company of the time, Netscape, and its use has been supported  more or less  in most browsers since. The key object for accessing web page elements in the DOM Level 0 is the document object. The DOM Level 0 Document In the earlier browser object model, page elements were accessed via the document ob- ject, via a set of element collections. For instance, to access an img element, we would access the images array, which contains entries for all images in the page, in order of their occurrence in the page:  var selectImage = document.images[1];    get second image in page  211   Figure 11-1. Example of a document tree  The earliest collections that can be accessed via the Document object are:  All images in the page  Any forms in the page  images  forms  links  cookie  All links in the page  declared with     Access, add, and modify web page cookies  Some of the collection elements themselves had collections, such as being able to access all elements within a form via the form’s elements property:  var elemOne = document.forms[0].elements[0];    first element in first form  As with images, elements could be accessed by array entry, with position in the array determined by the position of the element in the web page. In addition, elements given an identifier could also be accessed directly via the collection:    ...    212  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   var newForm = document.forms["new"];  Forms also had name attributes as well as ids, either of which could be used to access the form. The form could also be accessed, via a shortcut, by its identifier name:  var newForm = document.new;    form named "new"  Note, though, that this technique is not standardized via specification, though support for it is included in most  if not all  browsers.  Also note that the name attribute is only supported in a limited set of web page elements. You’re encouraged to use the id attribute instead.  In addition, all elements in the web page could be accessed via the document.all prop- erty, by specifying the identifier given the element:    ... var tstElem = document.all["test"];    returns ref to test div element  The all collection was created by Microsoft in Internet Explorer, and eventually be- came another de facto standard. The all property and the other collections are still available for use now, and many of the element collections are now in the DOM Level 2 HTML specification, but the all property’s use is discouraged in favor of the tech- niques formalized under the DOM Level 1 specification. The Standardized DOMs The problem with the earliest techniques in accessing web page elements is that the browser companies didn’t agree on any one technique, and to support all of the brows- ers we had to use a convoluted set of if statements, testing for browser support. The W3C remedied this problem by releasing a new, standard approach to working with the web page document object model: the DOM Level 1. Since then, the organi- zation has worked to refine the DOM with releases of DOM Level 2, DOM Level 3, and the current work associated with HTML5—demonstrated in this chapter and in the rest of this book. The W3C specifications provide a core API that can be used for more generic docu- ments, as well as APIs specific to HTML. These include a new events model, support for XPath, keyboard access, in addition to various methods to access existing elements, and to create new elements that can then be inserted into the document tree. The W3C documentation  for  the  DOM  consists  of  the  standards  specifications  and  language bindings. We’re primarily interested in the ECMAScript language binding.  11.0  Introduction  213   Be  aware  that  at  the  time  this  book  was  written,  implementation  of DOM Level 3 Events functionality was sketchy, at best.  The most used method supported in the DOM Level 2 and up is the document object method getElementById:    ... var testElement = document.getElementById "test" ;  The document.getElementById method originated in the DOM Level 1 HTML API, and then moved over as a more generalized method to DOM Level 2. With document.getElementById, rather than have to access a specific element collection or determine if document.all was supported, we can use the standard method and be assured of accessing any page element by its given id. The getElementById method was just the beginning, and this very helpful method has been joined by getElementsByTagName, to get all elements via a specific element tag;  getElementsByClassName, to get all elements that share the same class name; and the very new querySelector and querySelectorAll methods, which allow us to use the CSS style selectors in order to make more sophisticated queries.

It takes one parameter: a case-sensitive string with the element’s identifier. It returns an element object, which is referenced to the element if it exists; otherwise, it returns null. The returned  element object has a set of methods and properties, including several inherited  from  the  node  object.  The  node  methods  are  primarily  associated  with traversing the document tree. For instance, to find the parent node for the element, use the following:  var parent =demodiv.parentNode;    parent node property  If you want to find out what children an element has, you can traverse a collection of them through the childNodes property:  if  demodiv.hasChildNodes    {    var children =demodiv.childNodes;    for  var i = 0; i < children.length; i++  {       outputString+=" has child " + children[i].nodeName + " ";    } }  You can find out the type of element for each node through the nodeName property:  var type = parent.nodeName;    BODY  You also might be surprised at what appears as a child node. For instance, whitespace before and after an element is, itself, a child node, with a nodeName of text. For the following div element:     Some text   Some more text     has child text has child P  The demodiv element  node  has five children, not two:  11.1  Access a Given Element and Find Its Parent and Child Elements   215   has child text has child P has child text  However, IE8 only picks up the two paragraph elements, which demonstrates why it’s important to be specific with the queries and check nodeName to ensure you’re accessing the correct elements.  11.2  Accessing All Images in the Web Page Problem You want to access all img elements in a given document. Solution Use the document.getElementsByTagName method, passing in img as the parameter:  var imgElements = document.getElementsByTagName 'img' ;  Discussion The getElementsByTagName returns a collection of nodes  a NodeList  of a given element type, such as the img tag in the solution. The collection can be traversed like an array, and the order of nodes is based on the order of the elements within the document: the first img element in the page is accessible at index 0, and so on:  var imgElements = document.getElementsByTagName 'img' ; for  var i = 0; i < imgElements.length; i++  {    var img = imgElements[i];    ... }  Though the NodeList collection can be traversed like an array, it isn’t an Array object— you can’t use Array object methods, such as push   and reverse  , with a NodeList. NodeList’s only property is length, which contains the number of elements in the col- lection. The only method is item, which takes the index of the item, beginning with the first element at index 0:  var img = imgElements.item 1 ;    second image  NodeList is an intriguing object because it’s a live collection, which means changes made to the document after the NodeList is retrieved are reflected in the collection. Example  11-1  demonstrates  the  NodeList  live  collection  functionality,  as  well  as getElementsByTagName. In the example, three images in the web page are accessed as a NodeList collection using the getElementsByTagName method. The length property, with a value of 3, is output in an alert. Immediately after the alert, a new paragraph and img elements are created, and the img appended to the paragraph. To append the paragraph following the others in  216  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   the page, getElementsByTagName is used again, this time with the paragraph tags  p . We’re not really interested in the paragraphs, but in the paragraphs’ parent element, found via the parentNode property on each paragraph. The new paragraph element is appended to the paragraph’s parent element, and the previously accessed NodeList collection variable’s length property again printed out. Now, the value is 4, reflecting the addition of the new img element.  Example 11-1. Demonstrating getElementsByTagName and the NodeList live collection property         NodeList      <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {    var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName 'img' ;    alert imgs.length ;    var p = document.createElement "p" ;    var img = document.createElement "img" ;    img.src="orchids4.preview.jpg";    p.appendChild img ;     var paras = document.getElementsByTagName 'p' ;    paras[0].parentNode.appendChild p ;     alert imgs.length ; }   ]]>        <img src="orchids12.preview.jpg"   alt="Orchid from MBG 2009 orchid show"  >   <img src="orchids6.preview.jpg"   alt="Orchid from MBG 2009 orchid show"  >   <img src="orchids9.preview.jpg"   alt="Orchid from MBG 2009 orchid show"  >       In addition to using getElementsByTagName with a specific element type, you can also pass the universal selector  *  as a parameter to the method to get all elements:  var allelems = document.getElementsByTagName '*' ;  IE7, or IE8 running in IE7 mode, will return an empty nodelist if you use the universal selector with the getElementsByTagName method.  11.2  Accessing All Images in the Web Page  217   Namespace Variation There is a variation of getElementsByTagName, getElementsByTagNameNS, which can be used in documents that support multiple namespaces, such as an XHTML web page with embedded MathML or SVG. In Example 11-2, an SVG document is embedded in XHTML. Both the XHTML docu- ment and the embedded SVG make use of the title element. The title element in the XHTML document is part of the default XHTML namespace, but the title in the SVG is part of the Dublin Core namespace. When the title element is accessed, information about the title, including its name- space, the prefix, the localName and the textContent are printed out. The prefix is the dc component of dc:title, and the localName is the title part of dc:title. The text Content is a new property, added with the DOM Level 2, and is the text of the element. In the case of title  either the XHTML or the Dublin Core element , it would be the title text.  Example  11-2.

When using Firefox and ac- cessing title without using the namespace variation, the only title returned is the XHTML document title. However, when using the namespace variation  getElements ByTagNameNS , and specifying the Dublin Core namespace, all of the Dublin Core titles in the RDF within the SVG are returned. When  accessing  the  nonnamespaced  version  of  getElementsByTagName  in  Safari, Chrome, and Opera, both the XHTML title and the Dublin Core titles are returned, as shown in Figure 11-2.  Figure 11-2. Using getElementsByTagNameNS to get namespaced elements  Though IE8 doesn’t directly support the XHTML MIME type, if the page is served as text html using some form of content negotiation, IE will process the page as HTML. However, though the getElementsByTagName works with IE, the namespaced version of the  method,  getElementsByTagNameNS,  does  not.  All  of  the  values  are  returned  as undefined. IE8 doesn’t return the dc:title entries in the SVG, either.  220  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   If the Dublin Core namespace is declared in the html element, instead of in the svg element, IE8 does return all of the dc:title entries, as well as the XHTML title:  <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml"                           xmlns:dc="http:  xml:lang="en">  An  alternative  approach  consists  of  using  a  tag  name  string  that  concatenates  the prefix and localName. All of the browsers will find the dc:title using the following:  var titles = document.getElementsByTagName "dc:title" ;  However, you can’t access the namespace-specific properties using the pseudoname- space method. Your applications can’t access the namespace properties using the IE approach of embedding all of the namespace declarations in the html tag, but you can find out the namespace URI via Microsoft’s tagURN property:  alert title[i].tagURN ;    for dc:title  Browsers can use the following to get all elements with a given tag, regardless of name- space, if the document is served as application xhtml+xml or other XML type:  var titles = document.getElementsByTagNameNS "*","title" ;  This JavaScript returns both the default XHTML namespace title and the titles in the Dublin Core namespace.  As mentioned earlier, IE8 doesn’t properly support namespaces, but IE9 should with its new support for XHTML.  See Also Using getElementsByTagName to get all the paragraphs just to find their parent in Ex- ample 11-1 is overkill. Recipe 11.5 demonstrates how to use the Selectors API to directly access just the parent element for the paragraphs. The parentNode property is intro- duced in Recipe 11.1.  11.3  Discover All Images Within an Article Problem You want to access all images within article elements only. Solution Find all article elements in the web page. Once they are found, find the img elements for each one:  11.3  Discover All Images Within an Article  221   var imgString = "";     find all articles var articles = document.getElementsByTagName 'article' ;     find all images in articles for  var i = 0; i < articles.length; i++  {    var imgs = articles[i].getElementsByTagName 'img' ;        print out src    for  var j = 0; j < imgs.length; j++  {      var img = imgs[j];      imgString+=img.src + " ";    }  }  document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=imgString;  Discussion The DOM method getElementsByTagName is available for the element object, as well as the document object. This is handy if you want to look for elements of a certain type throughout the document or within a specific subtree of the document, with a given element as its root. In the solution, the first use of getElementsByTagName returns a nodeList, which is a collection of article elements for the entire document. This collection is traversed like an  array,  and  the  getElementsByTagName  is  used  again,  this  time  with  each  of  the article elements, to look for any img elements within the subtree formed by the article. The example works with all of the book target browsers except IE8. IE8 does pick up the articles from the first use of document.getElementsByTagName. However, IE8 does not support the use of getElementsByTagName with an element, so it doesn’t pick up the images. See Also In order to access the new HTML5 article element with IE8, you’ll need to use an HTML5 shim. IE8 and earlier versions don’t correctly process the new HTML5 ele- ments, such as article, without this additional assistance. Recipe 12.4 has more dis- cussion on using an HTML5 shim. Recipe 11.3 provides in-depth coverage of the getElementsByTagName method.  11.4  Discover all Images in Articles Using the Selectors API Problem You want to get a list of all img elements that are descendants of article elements, but not have to traverse HTML collection objects, which can be a slow operation.  222  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   Solution Use the newer Selectors API and access the img elements contained within article ele- ments using CSS-style selector strings:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll "article img" ;  Discussion Once you’ve worked with the Selectors API, you’ll never look for another way to access document elements. The Selectors API is a new specification that is undergoing work at the time this was written. It has broad implementation across browsers, though there are some differences in implementation support.  Earlier versions of browsers, such as IE7, Firefox 2, and so on, do not support the Selectors API. You’ll have to use fallback methods to per- form the same queries. In addition, IE8 does not support many selector variations.  There are two selector query API methods. The first, querySelectorAll, was demon- strated in the solution. The second is querySelector. The difference between the two is  querySelectorAll  returns  all  elements  that  match  the  selector  criteria,  while querySelector only returns the first found result. The selectors syntax is derived from those that support CSS selectors. In the example, all img elements that are descendants of article elements are returned. To access all img elements, regardless of parent element, use:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll "img" ;  In the solution, you’ll get all img elements that are direct or indirect descendants of a article element. This means that if the img element is contained within a div that’s within an article, this img element will be among those returned:                         If you want only those img elements that are direct children of an article element, you would use the following:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll "article> img" ;  If you’re interested in accessing all img elements that are immediately followed by a paragraph, you would use:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll "img + p" ;  11.4  Discover all Images in Articles Using the Selectors API   223   If you’re interested in an img element that has an empty alt attribute, you can use the following:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll 'img[alt=""]' ;  If you’re only interested in img elements that don’t have an empty alt attribute, use the following:  var imgs = document.querySelectorAll 'img:not [alt=""] ' ;  The negation pseudoselector  :not  is used to find all img elements with alt attributes that are not empty. For these queries, which are looking for all img elements that meet the given selectors, you should get the same result with the more modern browsers, such as Firefox 3.x, Opera 10.x, Safari 4.x, and Chrome 4.x. Unfortunately, IE8 has only limited support for selectors—the code in the solution does not work. The collection of elements returned from querySelectorAll is not a “live” collection, unlike the collection of objects returned from getElementsByTagName. Updates to the page  are  not  reflected  in  the  collection  if  the  updates  occur  after  the  collection  is retrieved.  Though the Selectors API is a wonderful creation, it shouldn’t be used for every document query. For instance, it’s not efficient for accessing elements  by  a  specific  identifier,  so  you’re  still  better  off  using getElementById for this purpose. Best bet is to test your application using the Selectors API and a variety of other methods and see which provides best performance and broadest support.  Namespace Variation CSS3 provides syntax for handling namespaces. This is how to define a namespace in CSS3, via the Namespace module:  @namespace svg "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg";  If an element is given with a namespace prefix, such as the following:   ...   to style the element, you would use:  @namespace q "http:  example.com q-markup"; qelem { ... }  and to style an attribute, you could use:  @namespace foo "http:  www.example.com"; [fooatt=val] { color: blue }  224  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements  Recipe 11.2 covered the concept of namespaces when querying against the document, and introduced the first of the namespace-specific methods: getElementsByTagNameNS.   Since the CSS selectors allow for resolving namespaces, we might assume we could use namespaces with querySelector and querySelectorAll. In fact we could, with earlier iterations of the API Selectors draft, but there is no way to do so now. Now, a namespace error will be thrown if the namespace is not resolved before using the Selectors API methods. Unfortunately, the Selectors API doesn’t provide an ap- proach to resolve the namespace before using one of the methods. Instead,  the  Selectors  API  specification  recommends  using  JavaScript  processing  to handle namespaces. For instance, to find all of the dc:title elements within an SVG element in a document, you could use the following: var list = document.querySelectorAll "svg title" ; var result = new Array  ; var svgns = "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg"  for var i = 0; i < list.length; i++  {   if list[i].namespaceURI == svgns  {     result.push list[i] ; }  In the example code, querying for all of the titles that are descendants of the svg element will return both SVG titles and any Dublin Core or other titles used in the SVG block. In the loop, if the title is in the Dublin Core namespace, it’s pushed on to the new array; otherwise, if the title is in some other namespace, including the SVG namespace, it’s disregarded. It’s not an elegant approach, but it is serviceable, and also the only option available for namespaces and the Selectors API at this time.  IE8 and earlier do not support the namespaceURI property, nor do they support  XHTML  or  SVG,  where  you  would  most  likely  need  to  use namespaces. IE9 should provide support for namespaces, XHTML, and SVG.  See Also JavaScript access of the new HTML5 elements, such as article, requires the use of a HTML5 shim: a small JavaScript application that enables the use of these elements in IE8. Recipe 12.4 has more on the use of the HTML5 shim. There are three different CSS selector specifications, labeled as Selectors Level 1, Level 2,  and  Level  3.  You  can  access  CSS  Selectors  Level  3  at  http:  www.w3.org TR css3 -selectors , a site which contains links to the documents defining the other levels. These documents provide the definitions of, and examples for, the different types of selectors. In addition, the CSS3 Namespace module can be found at http:  www.w3.org TR css3 -namespace , and is currently a Candidate Recommendation.  11.4  Discover all Images in Articles Using the Selectors API   225   There are currently two Selectors API specifications under development: the Selectors API Level 1, which is a Candidate Recommendation, and the Selectors API Level 2, which is a working draft. John Resig, the creator of the popular jQuery library, has provided a comprehensive test suite for selectors at http:  ejohn.org apps selectortest . The source for the test suite can be found at http:  github.com jeresig selectortest tree master. The CSS3.info site also has a nice selectors test at http:  tools.css3.info selectors-test test.html. This one is a little easier to view, and provides links with each test to the example code. As noted, Selectors API support isn’t universal. However, many of the popular Java- Script framework libraries, such as jQuery, Prototype, and Dojo, provide workarounds so you can use the selector and it offers a fallback, if necessary. Chapter 17 introduces using jQuery and other libraries with your application code.  11.5  Finding the Parent Element for a Group of Elements Problem You want to access the parent element for a group of paragraphs. Solution Use the querySelector method to access the first paragraph in the set, and then access the parentNode property for this element:  var parent = document.querySelector "body p" .parentNode;  Discussion With all the ways we can access child nodes and siblings, not to mention descendants to many depths, you’d think we’d also be able to directly query for parent elements. Unfortunately, there is nothing in CSS comparable to :parent to return a parent ele- ment. However, we can fake it by accessing a known child element and then accessing the parent via the parentNode property. In the solution, the querySelector method will return the first paragraph element that is a descendant of the body element. Since querySelector only returns one element, you don’t have to use array reference to access an individual element. Once we have one of the child elements, the parent is accessed via the parentNode property. See Also See  Recipe  11.4  for  more  details  on  the  Selectors  API  and  the  querySelector  and querySelectorAll methods.  226  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   11.6  Highlighting the First Paragraph in Every Element Problem Based on some user event, you want to dynamically change the background color to yellow for the first paragraph in every div element. Solution Use the document.querySelectAll with the appropriate CSS selector in order to refer- ence all first paragraphs in div elements, and then modify the paragraph’s CSS back- ground color:  var paras = document.querySelectorAll 'div p:first-of-type' ; for  var i = 0; i < paras.length; i++  {     paras[i].setAttribute "style","background-color: ffff00" ; }  If the specific pseudoselector syntax is not supported, use an alternative, such as the following:  var divs = document.querySelectorAll "div" ; for  var j = 0; j < divs.length; j++  {    var ps = divs.item j .getElementsByTagName "p" ;    if  ps.length > 0  {        ps[0].setAttribute "style","background-color: ffff00" ;    } }  Discussion We’re only interested in selectors where the paragraph element is a descendant of a div element:  var paras = document.querySelectorAll 'div p' ;  In addition, we’re interested in the first paragraph element in the div, so at first glance, the following looks acceptable:  var paras = document.querySelectorAll 'div p:first-child' ;  However, there’s no guarantee that the div element won’t contain elements of other types, and if the first element is not a paragraph, the first paragraph won’t be found. Instead, as shown in Example 11-3, the :first-of-type CSS selector is used so that the first paragraph in the div element is highlighted when the document is clicked, even if it isn’t the first element in the div. The code is included in a try...catch block in order to provide an alternative if the type of selector syntax isn’t supported.  11.6  Highlighting the First Paragraph in Every Element   227   Example 11-3. Using the first-of-type selector in order to highlight the first paragraph element in a div       paras      div {   padding: 10px;   border: 1px solid 000000; }      window.onload=function   {    document.onclick=function   {      try {       var paras = document.querySelectorAll 'div p:first-of-type' ;       for  var i = 0; i < paras.length; i++  {          paras[i].setAttribute "style","background-color: ffff00" ;       }      } catch e  {        var divs = document.querySelectorAll "div" ;        for  var j = 0; j < divs.length; j++  {           var ps = divs.item j .getElementsByTagName "p" ;           if  ps.length > 0  {              ps[0].setAttribute "style","background-color: ffff00" ;           }         }      }    }; }                 Paragraph one        Paragraph two        Paragraph three                Paragraph one        Paragraph two                          List item one           List item two               Paragraph one        Paragraph two         228  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   Figure 11-3 shows that even though the first element in the third div is an unordered list, the first paragraph that follows is still highlighted. Another CSS selector that pro- vides the same functionality is :nth-of-type 1 , where parentheses are used to wrap the number of the target element.  Figure 11-3. Page displaying highlighted first paragraphs in every div element  Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera support :first-of-type. IE8 doesn’t, but it does support :first-child. However, as the example demonstrates, we can’t count on the paragraph being the first element. Instead, we use a more generalized query for all div elements, and then access all the paragraphs with getElementsByTagName. We could use the getElementsByTagName for the first query, except that this method returns a live collection, and the first approach doesn’t. We want the functionality to be the same for both approaches, as much as possible. If you need to support IE7, though,  you  should  use  getElementsByTagName,  as  this  browser  doesn’t  support querySelectorAll.  11.6  Highlighting the First Paragraph in Every Element   229   See Also See  Recipe  11.2  for  more  on  getElementsByTagName  and  live  collections,  and  Rec- ipe 11.4 for an in-depth introduction to the Selectors API.

Solution Use the Selectors API to query for every other item in the list, and then change the background color:  var lis = document.querySelectorAll 'li:nth-child 2n+1 ' ; for  var i = 0; i < lis.length; i++  {    lis[i].setAttribute "style","background-color: ffeeee" ; }  or:  var lis = document.querySelectorAll 'li:nth-child odd ' ; for  var i = 0; i < lis.length; i++  {    lis[i].setAttribute "style","background-color: eeeeff" ; }  or access the list parent element and then traverse its child nodes, changing the back- ground color of every other element, using the arithmetic modulo operator:  var parentElement = document.getElementById "thelist" ; var lis = parentElement.getElementsByTagName "li" ; for  var i = 0; i < lis.length; i++  {    if  i % 2 == 0  {       lis[i].setAttribute "style","background-color: eeffee" ;    } }  Discussion The :nth-child   pseudoclass allows us to specify an algorithm pattern, which can be used to find elements that match a certain pattern, such as 2n+1, to find every other element. You can also use the odd and even arguments to access the odd or even elements of the type:  var lis = document.querySelectorAll 'li:nth-child odd ' ;  230  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   Not all browsers support this relatively new selector type. Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome do, but IE8 doesn’t support the first two approaches given in the solution, and older versions of most other browsers don’t. In these situations, you’ll want to use the third approach in the solutions: get access to all of the elements using whatever method, and then use the modulo arithmetic operator to filter the elements. The modulo operator returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second. Dividing the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on by 2 returns 0; the condition is successful, and the element is affected. In the solution, the even elements are the ones affected. To access the odd elements, use the following:  if   i + 1  % 2   {  ... }  The setAttribute with the style property also doesn’t work for IE7 for the third ap- proach. The downloadable example code contains a workaround for this browser. See Also See  Recipe  11.4  for  more  details  on  the  Selectors  API  and  the  querySelector  and querySelectorAll methods. See Recipe 12.15 for more on setAttribute.  11.8  Creating an Array of All Elements of a Given Class Problem You want to retrieve a collection of elements that have a specific class name within the document. Solution Use the getElementsByClassName method to retrieve a collection of all elements in the document that share the same class name:  var elems = document.getElementsByClassName "classname" ;  or use the Selectors API to get the class-named items: var elems = document.querySelectorAll ".classname" ;  Discussion The method, getElementsByClassName, goes beyond one element type to find all ele- ments that share the same class value. It can also work with multiple classes:  var elems = document.getElementsByClassName "firstclass secondclass" ;  11.8  Creating an Array of All Elements of a Given Class   231   Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera support getElementsByClassName, but IE8 doesn’t. The second approach using querySelectorAll is a good alternative option. It, too, can search for multiple class names:  var elems = document.querySelectorAll ".firstclass, .secondclass" ;  See Also See  Recipe  11.4  for  more  details  on  the  Selectors  API  and  the  querySelector  and querySelectorAll methods.  11.9  Finding All Elements That Share an Attribute Problem You want to find all elements in a web document that share the same attribute. Solution Use the universal selector  *  in combination with the attribute selector to find all ele- ments that have an attribute, regardless of its value: var elems = document.querySelectorAll '*[class]' ;  The universal selector can also be used to find all elements with an attribute that’s assigned the same value:  elems = document.querySelectorAll '*[class="red"]' ;  Discussion The solution demonstrates a rather elegant query selector. All elements are analyzed because of the use of the universal selector  * . To test the existence of an attribute, all you need do is list the attribute name within square brackets  [attrname] . In Recipe 11.8, a couple approaches were demonstrated for finding all elements that have a specific class name. The query selector used in the solution could be modified to do the same:  var elems = document.querySelectorAll '*[class"=test"]' ;  If you’re not sure of the class name, you can use the substring-matching query selector:  var elements = document.querySelectorAll '*[class*="test"]' ;  Now any class name that contains the substring test matches. You could also modify the syntax to find all elements that don’t have a certain value. For  instance,  to  find  all  div  elements  that  don’t  have  the  target  class  name,  use the :not negation operator:  var elems = document.querySelectorAll 'div:not .test ' ;  232  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   This and the selector syntax examples given in the solution work with Opera, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Both of the selector syntax examples in the solution work with IE8, but the use of the negation operator, :not, does not. The querySelectorAll method does not work with IE7. See Also See  Recipe  11.4  for  more  details  on  the  Selectors  API  and  the  querySelector  and querySelectorAll methods.  11.10  Finding All Checked Options Problem You want to find all checkbox input elements that are selected  checked : Solution Use  a  :checked  pseudoclass  selector  to  directly  query  all  checked  checkbox  input elements:  var checked = document.querySelectorAll "checks input[type='checkbox']:checked" ; for  var i = 0; i < checked.length; i++  {   str+=checked[i].value + " "; }  If the :checked selector fails, use the following, which accesses all of the input elements, checks their type, and then checks to see if they’re selected:  var inputs = document.querySelectorAll "checks input" ; for  var j = 0; j < inputs.length; j++  {    if  inputs.item j .type == "checkbox" && inputs.item j .checked  {      str+=inputs.item j .value + " ";     } }  Discussion The :checked pseudoselector will only return those checkbox or radio elements that are checked. Since we only want the checkbox input types, we further refined the se- lector syntax to look for a specific type of input element. The use of the :checked pseudoclass selector is a nicely targeted approach, though it’s only supported in Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, and not in IE8. The alternative does work in IE8, but not IE7, which doesn’t support the querySelectorAll method.  11.10  Finding All Checked Options   233   When working with these new selectors, a good approach is to wrap the selector query in a try statement and then provide an alternative in the catch statement. Incorporating this into the solution gives us:    var str = "checked values ";   try {     var checked = document.querySelectorAll "checks input[type='checkbox']:checked" ;     for  var i = 0; i < checked.length; i++  {       str+=checked[i].value + " ";     }   } catch e  {     var inputs = document.querySelectorAll "checks input" ;     for  var j = 0; j < inputs.length; j++  {        if  inputs.item j .type == "checkbox" &&                               inputs.item j .checked  {          str+=inputs.item j .value + " ";        }     }   }   document.getElementById "results" .innerHTML=str;  See Also Recipe  11.4  includes  more  details  on  the  Selectors  API  and  the  querySelector  and querySelectorAll methods.  11.11  Summing All the Values in a Table Row Problem You want to sum the numbers in table cells per row  or per column . Solution Use the Selectors API to access the specific table row cells directly, or retrieve a collec- tion of all table rows, access the target row from the returned collection, and then access the table row’s cells. Once retrieved by either method, traverse the cells, accessing the cell data and converting the data to a number:  try {   var cells = document.querySelectorAll "tr:nth-child 3  td" ; } catch e  {   var tableElement = document.getElementById "thetable" ;   var trs = tableElement.getElementsByTagName "tr" ;   var cells = trs[2].getElementsByTagName "td" ; }     process cell data var sum = 0; for  var i = 0; i < cells.length; i++  {  234  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements      var val = parseFloat cells[i].firstChild.data ;    if  !isNaN val   {       sum+=val;    } }     output the sum alert "sum " + sum ;  Discussion There are several ways to get all the cells for a table row, including adding a click event handler to the rows, and then processing all of the cells when the row is clicked. In the solution, we looked at two different approaches. The first approach uses the Selectors API querySelectorAll with a selector that targets all table cells in the third table row. The second approach is to access all of the table rows, using getElementsBy TagName, and then access all the table cells using the same method, against the target row. I prefer the first approach, because it reduces the processing involved and provides better, targeted results. However, tr:nth-child 3  td isn’t supported in IE8. To pre- vent problems where the selector syntax or querySelectorAll aren’t supported, the code is wrapped in a try...catch block, with the second approach as the fallback option. What if we want to sum a column of table cells, rather than a row? In this case, what we really want is every table cell in a specific position for every table row. For this type of functionality, especially in light of some of the quirks with querySelectorAll, we’ll need to use another approach, such as getElementsByTagName. Example 11-4 shows an example that sums values from the third column—skipping the first row, which con- sists of column headers.  Example 11-4. Application that sums cells in third table column         Sum Table Column      <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {   var table = document.querySelector "table" ;   table.onclick=sum; }  function sum   {   var rows =       document.getElementById "sumtable" .getElementsByTagName "tr" ;   var sum = 0;       start with one to skip first row, which is col headers   for  var i = 1; i < rows.length; i++  {     sum+=parseFloat rows[i].childNodes[2].firstChild.data ;  11.11  Summing All the Values in a Table Row  235     }   alert sum ; }    ]]>            Value 1  Value 2  Value 3  Value 4      --  **  5.0  nn     18.53  9.77  3.00  153.88     Alaska  Montana  18.33  Missouri           The actual data value is accessed via the data property of the Text node that is the td child element. The parseFloat method is used to convert the text to a number. If you’re not sure that the table cells contain numbers, you’ll want to test the value first, or you could up with a result of NaN. In the example, the table rows are accessed using getElementsByTagName directly on the table element, which is retrieved using the getElementById method on the document object. Rather than have to use all of these methods individually, I chain the methods one after another. Method chaining doesn’t work with all JavaScript object methods, but it does work with many among the DOM objects. You probably wouldn’t use a querySelector or getElementsByTagName with a static web table, because you can create the sums as you’re building the table  if the table is built via an Ajax call . However, if you’re using something like editing in place to add or modify table values, this isn’t a bad approach to update column or row sums after the edit. The example works with all the book’s target browsers, but does not work with IE7 because of the use of querySelector. See Also ParseFloat is covered in Recipe 4.5. Recipe 16.13 has a demonstration and a more in- depth explanation of method chaining. Recipe 11.4 includes more details on the Se- lectors API and the querySelector and querySelectorAll methods.  236  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   11.12  Get Element Attributes Problem You want to access the information contained in an element attribute. Solution If the attribute is defined as a standard attribute in the DOM by the user agent  browser , you can access the attribute directly on the element:    ...  var field = document.getElementById "field" ; alert field.checked ;    true alert field.value ;     test alert field.type ;     text  Some attributes are renamed when you access them in JavaScript, such as the class attribute, which you access as className:    testing   ...    var elem = document.getElementById "elem" ;    alert elem.className ;     test  For nonstandard attributes, or ones that have been newly defined but are not considered standard by the specific browser, you need to use the getAttribute method:  var index = elem.getAttribute "data-index" ; alert index ;    1  var role = elem.getAttribute "role" ; alert role ;     article  Discussion When elements are defined in various HTML specifications, such as HTML5, they’re given a set of shared and or unique attributes, which you can access directly from the object:  var id = elem.id;  Nonstandard or newly defined attributes have to be accessed using the getAttribute method:  var role = elem.getAttribute "role" ;  Since  the  getAttribute  method  works  equally  well  with  standard  and  nonstandard attributes, you should get in the habit of using the method to access all attributes.  11.12  Get Element Attributes   237   If the attribute doesn’t exist, the method returns a value of null or the empty string  "" . You can check to see if an attribute exists first, by using the hasAttribute method:  if  elem.hasAttribute role   {   var role = elem.getAttribute "role" ;    ... }  This approach bypasses the problem that can occur when different user agents return different values  empty string or null  when an attribute doesn’t exist. See Also There is a namespace variation of getAttribute, getAttributeNS, which takes the name- space as the first parameter of the method. See Recipe 11.2 for more on working with namespaces.  11.13  Get Style Information for an Element Problem You want to get one or more CSS style settings for an element. Solution If you want to access style information that’s set inline or via JavaScript, and access it directly on the element’s style property, use:  var width = elem.style.width;  If you want to access the element’s existing style information, regardless of how it’s set, you need to use a cross-browser approach:  function getStyle elem, cssprop, cssprop2 {      IE  if  elem.currentStyle  {    return elem.currentStyle[cssprop];      other browsers  } else if  document.defaultView &&                    document.defaultView.getComputedStyle  {    return document.defaultView.getComputedStyle elem, null .getPropertyValue cssprop2 ;      fallback  } else {    return null;  } }  window.onload=function   {  238  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements         setting and accessing style properties    var elem = document.getElementById "elem" ;     var color = getStyle elem,"backgroundColor", "background-color" ;    alert color ;    rgb 0,255,0  }  Discussion Every web page element has a set of properties and methods, some unique to the object, and some inherited from other objects, such as Element or Node, covered in earlier rec- ipes. One of the properties elements share is the style object, representing the CSS style settings for the element. There are a couple of ways you can get style information. The first is to directly access the style object, using the familiar dot notation used throughout the book to access object properties and methods:  var elem = document.getElementById "elem" ; var width = elem.style.width;  All inline or dynamically set style settings can be accessed using this approach, but there is  a  special  syntax  you  have  to  use.  For  nonhyphenated  property  values,  such  as width, you access the setting directly:  var width = elem.style.width;  However, for property names with hyphens, such as background-color, use a Camel- Case notation such as the following:  var bkcolor = elem.style.backgroundColor;  Using background-color doesn’t work, because JavaScript interprets the hyphen as a subtraction operator. The new name is formed by removing the hyphen, and capitalizes the first letter of the word following the hyphen. Another approach to accessing the style is to use the getAttribute method to access the style object:  var style = elem.getAttribute "style" ;  However, you would then have to parse the values out of the string. You’re better off just accessing the values directly on the style property.  IE7 also returns an object, rather than a string with CSS values, when you access the style property using getAttribute.  11.13  Get Style Information for an Element   239   Only those CSS values that are set inline, using the element’s style attribute, or set dynamically using JavaScript, are accessible using either of the approaches just dem- onstrated.  To  access  CSS  values  set  by  default  by  the  user  agent,  via  a  stylesheet, dynamically, or inline, you’ll need to use a cross-browser approach:  var style; var cssprop = "fontFamily"; var cssprop2 = "font-family"; if  elem.currentStyle  {   style = elem.currentStyle[cssprop]; } else if  document.defaultView &&                    document.defaultView.getComputedStyle  {   style = document.defaultView.getComputedStyle elem, null .getPropertyValue cssprop2 ; }  The currentStyle object is an IE-specific object that consists of a collection of all sup- ported and applicable CSS style properties for an element. It expects values to be in CamelCase notation, such as fontFamily, rather than font-family. The book’s other target browsers support the window.getComputedStyle method, which can also be accessed as document.defaultView.getComputedStyle. This method takes two parameters: the element, and a pseudoelement, which is typically left null  or an empty string, "" . What’s returned using the cross-browser approach is rather interesting. It’s the com- puted style for the element, which is a combination of all CSS settings, including those that are set by default by the browser, set using a stylesheet, or set dynamically using CSS. What’s returned when accessing the font-family depends on the circumstances:    If the font-family is not set, you’ll get the browser default value, if any   If the font-family is set via a stylesheet, you’ll get the stylesheet value   If the font-family is set inline and in a stylesheet, you’ll get the inline value   If the font-family is set dynamically, regardless of whether it is set inline or in a  stylesheet, you’ll get the dynamic value  See Also Example 12-7, in Recipe 12.15, demonstrates various techniques for setting and re- trieving style information.  240  Chapter 11: Accessing Page Elements   CHAPTER 12 Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes  12.0  Introduction The existing Document Object Models provide a plethora of methods you can use to create new web document elements. Most of the methods I use in this chapter and in the following chapters are from the DOM Levels 1 and 2 and, since most of the examples in this chapter are specific to HTML or XHTML documents, the methods and objects described inherit functionality from both Core and HTML DOM specifications. There is one older property, innerHTML, from the nonstandard DOM Level 0, that I’ll also demonstrate, primarily because it’s so popular, and also because of new support in HTML5. Most of the methods and associated properties are available with all of the modern browsers. I’ll make a note where a method or property isn’t supported by one or more browsers. See Also See the Introduction to Chapter 11, for a more in-depth look at the Document Object Model and the DOM levels.  12.1  Using innerHTML: A Quick and Easy Approach to Adding Content Problem You want to add a couple of paragraphs with text to a div element, and you want to do so quickly and easily.  241   Solution Use  the  innerHTML  property  to  overwrite  an  element’s  existing  contents,  with  new material:  var div = document.getElementById "target" ; div.innerHTML = " This is a paragraph  This is a second ";  Discussion The innerHTML property has been around for a very long time, and is part of what is known as DOM Level 0—the first de facto API developed by the browser companies. It can be much faster when you’re making complex additions to the web page, because its processing is handled by the HTML parser, rather than the DOM engine. Because innerHTML was never part of a standard, there are some variations in how it’s implemented. For instance, not all browsers support the use of innerHTML with tables, so you won’t want to use the property for adding table rows. The use of innerHTML isn’t standard with XML formats, such as XHTML, as there’s no way to ensure that what is appended into the page is well formed. In earlier years, the use of innerHTML wasn’t even supported with XHTML documents. Now,  though,  innerHTML  is  becoming  officially  blessed  by  being  defined  within  the HTML5 effort. In addition, the outerHTML property has also been formally defined in the HTML5 specification. It differs from innerHTML in that outerHTML represents both the element and the element’s contents, while innerHTML only represents the element’s contents.  Currently, the HTML5 specification states that the use of innerHTML will abort the current X HTML parsing process. And not all browsers allow innerHTML to be set until after the page is finished loading. Based on these restrictions, it’s best to not use innerHTML until after the page is com- pletely loaded.  12.2  Inserting Elements Before Existing Page Elements Problem You need to add a new div element to the web page before an existing div element. Solution Use the DOM method createElement to create a new div element. Once created, attach it  to  the  web  page  before  an  existing  element,  using  another  DOM  method, insertBefore:  242  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes      get the existing element var refElement = document.getElementById "sister" ;     get the element's parent node var parent = refElement.parentNode;     create new div element var newDiv = document.createElement "div" ;     attach to page before sister element parent.insertBefore newDiv, refElement ;  Discussion Adding a web page element is uncomplicated, as long as you keep in mind the tree-like structure of the web page. If you’re interested in attaching a web page element before another element, you’ll not only need to access this element, but also the target ele- ment’s parent element, in order to create the actual placement. The reason you need the parent element is that there is no functionality to insert an element before another, given just the target element. Instead, you have to access the target element’s parent element, and use the insertBefore method to insert the new element before the existing one. In Example 12-1, the solution for this recipe is embedded into a web page that originally consists only of one named div element. When this element receives a click event, a new sister div element is created and inserted into the document before the existing element.  Example 12-1. Inserting a div element into a web page        object detection    div {   width: 50%;   height: 20px;   padding: 10px;   margin: 10px 0; }  div1 {   background-color: ffff00;   }  .divclass {   background-color: ccffcc; }  12.2  Inserting Elements Before Existing Page Elements   243        window.onload=function   {   document.getElementById "div1" .onclick=addDiv; }  function addDiv   {       get parent   var parent = this.parentNode;       create new div   var newDiv = document.createElement "div" ;   newDiv.className = "divclass";   newDiv.innerHTML = " I'm here, I'm in the page ";       add to page   parent.insertBefore newDiv,this ; }                 Click me to add new element         In the example, since the event is attached to the original div element, a reference to it can be accessed using this within the event function, because the element is the owner of the onclick event handler function. You can then get the element’s parent through the parentNode property. Once you have a reference to both the parent and the existing element, all you need to do is create the new div element and insert it. Use the document.createElement method, passing in the type of element—in this case, div. Since the current document is an HTML document, the createElement method creates  a  new  HTMLElement,  which  inherits  all  functionality  of  the  more  generic Element class, as well as additional methods and properties. The new element is assigned a CSS style through the className property, which is a standard property for all HTMLEle ment objects. It’s given some content using the innerHTML property. The new div element is then added to the web page with insertBefore. Each successive click of the original div element prepends a new div element to the original, each with the same class and content. Figure 12-1 shows the web page after the original div element has been clicked several times.  244  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   Figure 12-1. Inserting div elements into a web page  Namespace Variation Recipe 11.2 included a discussion on namespaces and their impact on some of the DOM methods that allow us to query and add new web page elements in a document that can  contain  multiple  namespaces.  If  you’re  working  within  an  environment  where namespaces are supported, such as an XHTML or SVG document, and you create a new element or attribute, it’s automatically added to the document’s default namespace unless you use one of the namespace-specific DOM methods. Generally, the default behavior is sufficient. However, if you want to create an element within a specific namespace, such as creating a title in the Dublin Core namespace rather  an  XHTML  title,  use  the  namespace  variation  of  createElement,  createEle mentNS:  var dcTitle = document.createElementNS "http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ","title" ;  The createElementNS takes two parameters: the first is the namespace for the element; the second is the element tag.  12.2  Inserting Elements Before Existing Page Elements   245   The  namespace  method  createElementNS  is  not  supported  in  HTML  currently,  as namespaces aren’t supported in HTML. The method is also not currently supported in IE8, but should be in IE9, when Microsoft adds support for XHTML. See Also See Recipe 11.2 for more information about namespaces and the DOM. For a specific description of the HTMLElement, see the related W3C page.  12.3  Appending a New Element to the End of a Page Problem You want to add a new element to a web page, but you want to append it to the end of the page. Solution Access the highest level web page element, the body element, and use the appendChild method to append the new element to the page:  var bdy = document.getElementsByTagName "body" [0];    body element var newDiv = document.createElement "div" ;     append to body bdy.appendChild newDiv ;  Discussion Since we’re appending the new element to the end of the page, it makes sense to access the top-level page element  the body element  directly, using the DOM getElementsBy TagName  method.  Since  the  method  always  returns  an  array   more  properly,  a nodeList , we get the individual element in the first array index:  var bdy = document.getElementsByTagName "body" [0];  Once we have the parent element, the appendChild method appends the new element to the end of the parent element. The method takes just one parameter: the newly created element. Will a document always have a body element? Typically, yes, if the document is HTML or XHTML. However, if you’re working with other document types, such as SVG or MathML, or are concerned about ensuring that the new element is appended to what- ever is the top-level document element, you can use the approach demonstrated in Recipe 12.0 to get the parent of an existing element that will be a sibling to the new element:  var bdy = document.getElementById "div1" .parentNode;  246  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   This sibling-parent approach ensures that the new element is appended as a sibling of the existing element, and at the same level in the document tree.  12.4  Triggering Older Versions of IE to Style New Elements Problem You want to use one of the new HTML5 elements, such as article, and have it styled or programmatically accessible in IE7 8. Solution Use document.createElement in order to trigger IE8  and IE7  into properly handling new HTML5 elements:     add article element document.createElement "article" ;  Discussion The article element is one of the new HTML5 elements, accessible via the DOM by all of the book’s target browsers except for IE. In order to style or programmatically access article with IE8 or older, you need to apply an HTML5 shim. This shim intro- duces  the  article  and  other  new  elements  to  the  IE  DOM  tree  by  using  the document.createElement method to create one instance of the element:  document.createElement "article" ;  The element doesn’t have to be assigned to a variable name or inserted into the web page—it just has to be created. Once an instance of the element type is created, IE can recognize the element. This step is essential not only for JavaScript applications, but to ensure the element can be styled with CSS. Entire libraries now exist in order to define all of the HTML5 elements. All you need do is include the library before any other script in the page. The html5-shims page at Google Code maintains a list of HTML5 shims and other resources. The library I use in the book examples is the html5shiv, originally created by John Resig and now main- tained by Remy Sharp, at http:  html5shiv.googlecode.com svn trunk html5.js. See Also See Recipes 11.3 and 11.4 for JavaScript applications that are dependent on the HTML5 shim.  12.4  Triggering Older Versions of IE to Style New Elements   247   12.5  Inserting a New Paragraph Problem You want to insert a new paragraph just before the third paragraph within a div element. Solution Use some method to access the third paragraph, such as getElementsByTagName, to get all of the paragraphs for a div element. Then use the createElement and insertBefore DOM methods to add the new paragraph just before the existing third paragraph:     get the target div var div = document.getElementById "target" ;     retrieve a collection of  paragraphs var paras = div.getElementsByTagName "p" ;     if a third para exists, insert the new element before    otherwise, append the paragraph to the end of the div var newPara = document.createElement "p" ; if  paras[3]  {    div.insertBefore newPara, paras[3] ; } else {    div.appendChild newPara ; }  Discussion The document.createElement method creates any HTML element, which then can be assigned other elements or data and appended or inserted into the page. In the solution, the new paragraph element is inserted before an existing paragraph using the insert Before method. Since we’re interested in inserting the new paragraph before the existing third para- graph, we need to retrieve a collection of the div element’s paragraphs, check to make sure a third paragraph exists, and then use the insertBefore method to insert the new paragraph before the old. If the third paragraph doesn’t exist, we can append the ele- ment to the end of the div element using the appendChild method instead. See Also Chapter 11 demonstrates several techniques for accessing page elements, including getElementsByTagName. If your target browsers support it, you could also use the Selec- tors API to fine-tune the query. The following recipe, Recipe 12.6, contains a complete example demonstrating how to access the div element and the paragraphs, and add a paragraph with text just before the second paragraph.  248  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   12.6  Adding Text to a New Paragraph Problem You  want  to  create  a  new  paragraph  with  text  and  insert  it  just  before  the  second paragraph within a div element:     use getElementById to access the div element var div = document.getElementById "target" ;     use getElementsByTagName and the collection index    to access the second paragraph var oldPara = div.getElementsByTagName "p" [1];    zero based index     create a text node var txt =  document.createTextNode "The new paragraph will contain this text" ;     create a new paragraph var para = document.createElement "p" ;     append the text to the paragraph, and insert the new para para.appendChild txt ; div.insertBefore para, oldPara ;  Discussion The text within an element is itself an object within the DOM. Its type is a Text node, and it is created using a specialized method, createTextNode. The method takes one parameter: the string containing the text. Example 12-2 shows a web page with a div element containing four paragraphs. The JavaScript that runs after the page loads creates a new paragraph from text provided by the user via a prompt window. The text could just as easily have come from an Ajax application, as we’ll see later in the book. The provided text is used to create a text node, which is then appended as a child node to the new paragraph. The paragraph element is inserted in the web page before the first paragraph.  Example 12-2.

Solution You can use the createAttribute method to create an Attr node, set its value using the nodeValue property, and then use setAttribute to add to an element:  var someElement = document.getElement "elem" ; var newAttr = document.createAttribute "newAttribute" ; newAttr.nodeValue = "testvalue"; someElement.setAttribute newAttr ;  or you can set the value directly with setAttribute, passing in the attribute name and value:  someElement.setAttribute "newAttribute","testvalue" ;  Discussion You can add any number of attributes to a document element using either createAt tribute and setAttribute, or setAttribute directly. Both approaches are equally effi- cient, so unless there’s a real need, you’ll most likely want to use the simpler approach of setting the attribute name and value directly in setAttribute.  12.7  Adding Attributes to an Existing Element   251   When would you need to use createAttribute? If the attribute value is going to be another entity reference, as is allowable with XML, you’ll need to use the createAttri bute to create an Attr node, as setAttribute will only support simple strings. You can also use setAttribute to modify the value for an existing attribute, such as the id or class attributes:  someElement.setAttribute "id", "newId" ;  Note, though, that some values have a different name when set directly, than when they’re  set  using  setAttribute.  One  such  as  is  class,  which  is  set  directly  using className:  someElement.className = "new"; someElement.setAttribute "class", "new" ;  If  the  attribute  already  exists,  assigning  a  value  to  the  attribute  directly  or  using setAttribute modifies the attribute’s value. Namespace Variation As  discussed  in  Recipes  11.2  and  12.2,  if  you  use  the  createAttribute  or setAttribute methods in a document where multiple namespaces are supported  such as in an XHTML or SVG document , the engine processing the request sets the attribute without a namespace. If you mix setAttribute and setAttributeNS in the same docu- ment, you can end up with the same attribute in different namespaces. If you’re working in a document that’s using elements and attributes from different namespaces, such as an XHTML document that incorporates SVG and MathML, you’ll need to use the namespace-sensitive variants, createAttributeNS and setAttributeNS:  someElement.setAttributeNS "http:  somecompany.com namespace",                            "class", "somename" ;  12.8  Testing for a Boolean Attribute Problem You want to test to see if an element has a Boolean attribute. Solution Use the hasAttribute method to check for the existence of the Boolean or any other attribute:  var targetNode = document.getElementById "target" ; if  targetNode.hasAttribute "class"   {    alert targetNode.getAttribute "class"  ; }  252  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   Discussion Boolean attributes, referred to as attribute minimization in the XHTML specifications, are attributes in HTML where the attribute’s presence signifies a state, and is assigned no value. An example is the use of the Boolean attribute compact with the dl element:  In XHTML, these attributes have to be assigned a value, so they’re assigned a value comparable to the name of the attribute:        You can check for the Boolean attribute  or any other  using hasAttribute or its name- space variation:  var res = div.hasAttributeNS "http:  some.com namespace","attrnm" ;  A value of true signifies the attribute is present; false that it is not.  The hasAttribute method is not supported in IE7.  See Also See Recipes 11.2 and 12.2 for more on namespace issues.  12.9  Removing an Attribute Problem You want to remove an attribute from an element. Solution Use the removeAttribute method:  if  targetNode.hasAttribute "class"   {    targetNode.removeAttribute "class" ;    alert targetNode.getAttribute "class"  ;    null }  Discussion Most of the time, you’re probably interested in changing an attribute’s value, but there may be times when you want to remove an attribute completely. You might be tempted to set the value of the attribute to null to remove it:  div.setAttribute "class",null ;  12.9  Removing an Attribute  253   However, this is not correct. To remove any attribute, use the removeAttribute method, or its namespace variant, removeAttributeNS:  div.removeAttributeNS "http:  somecom.com namespace","customattr" ;  You don’t technically have to use hasAttribute to check if the attribute exists first— using removeAttribute on a nonexistent attribute does not throw an exception. Handy, since IE7 does not support hasAttribute. See Also See Recipes 11.2 and 12.2 for more on namespace-specific methods.  12.10  Moving a Paragraph Problem You want to move the last paragraph to before the first. Solution Get a reference to the paragraph you want to move, the first paragraph, and the parent element for the first paragraph, and use insertBefore to insert the last paragraph before the first:  var para = document.getElementsByTagName "p" ; var parent = para[0].parentNode; parent.insertBefore para[para.length-1], para[0] ;  Discussion An element exists only once in the DOM regardless of its location. When you insert or append the element in a new location, it’s automatically removed from its previous position in the page layout. See Also See Recipe 12.2 for a description of insertBefore.  12.11  Replacing Links with Footnote Bullets Problem You want to scan a web page for links, remove the links from the page, and replace them with text-based footnote bullets at the end of the document.  254  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   Solution You’ll have to use a variety of techniques to accomplish this task. Example 12-3 dem- onstrates a full application that moves all of the links contained in a paragraph to a bulleted footnote list at the end of the document—copying the contents of the link to the original link position first, and adding a superscript to reference the new footnote.  Example 12-3. Application to pull links out of the web document and append in a list at the end       Moving Links     ul li   {     list-style-type: none;     padding-bottom: 5px;   }      window.onload=function   {    var links = document.querySelectorAll "a" ;   var footnote = document.createElement "ul" ;       for all links   for  var i = 0; i < links.length; i++  {         get parent element     var parent = links[i].parentNode;         create number index text     var num = document.createTextNode i+1 ;     var sup = document.createElement "sup" ;     sup.appendChild num ;         process the children     var children = links[i].childNodes;     for  var j = 0; j < children.length; j++  {          var newChild = children[j].cloneNode true ;          parent.insertBefore newChild,links[i] ;     }         add number subscript     var sup2 = sup.cloneNode true ;     parent.insertBefore sup2,links[i] ;         add a link to footnote     var li = document.createElement "li" ;     li.appendChild sup ;     li.appendChild links[i] ;      footnote.appendChild li ;  12.11  Replacing Links with Footnote Bullets   255     }    document.getElementsByTagName "body" [0].appendChild footnote ;}              A favorite place of mine to visit in St. Louis is the <a href="http:  http:  www.mobot.org ">Missouri Botanical Gardens . Great flowers all year round, and one of the finest annual orchid shows. My most visited places, though, are the <a href="http:  www.stlzoo.org ">St. Louis Zoo , the   Gateway Arch  ,  the new  City Garden , and the  Powder Valley Conservation Nature Center .             Discussion As demonstrated in the solution, you can use querySelectorAll to find all the links in the page, passing in the anchor tag:  var links = document.querySelectorAll "a" ;  You can’t use getElementsByTagName to get the links, and I’ll explain why a little later in the discussion. The solution also creates a new unordered list to contain the links we pull out of the document. Once you have a reference to all the links in the page, it’s time for the fun part. One of the interesting challenges with moving a link is that you typically want to preserve the link’s text in place—especially if the link references meaningful content—beyond the to-be-discouraged “here” or “link”. You can’t assume the link contents are text because a link can contain other elements  though not another link . You could use innerHTML to access and copy the contents, but innerHTML isn’t well supported in XHTML. Another approach is to move all of the child nodes out of the link. Now, you might think  a  way  to  move  the  link  contents  out  of  the  link  is  to  use  something  like  the following:  var children = links[i].childNodes; for  var j = 0; j < children.length; j++  {      parent.insertBefore children[j],links[i] ; }  The problem with this approach, though, is that childNodes points to a nodeList. In Chapter 11, we learned that nodeLists are live collections, which means changes in the page are reflected immediately in the nodeList in our code. So, if the link is something like the following:   O'Reilly sells  books!    256  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   The childNodes collection would have a length of 2 for the text node and the em. How- ever, in the first loop iteration, once the first element has been moved  in this case, inserted before the existing link’s location, but it could be moved to the bullet list , the length of the childNodes value is now 1, but the for loop iterator has been incremented to 1—there is now only one child in the collection, and the for loop exits, leaving us with a link with the contents of the em element. This is all really nice functionality, but it works against us sometimes. This is also the reason I didn’t use the getElementsByTagName method to get a list of the anchor tags. The getElementsByTagName also returns a live nodeList, and when we append the links to the in-memory unordered list, the link is removed from the document, and the length of the collection is affected. Luckily, as the solution demonstrates, we have other methods that do what we want, without the interesting side effects. The cloneNode method is used to clone the child elements, which the solution places just before the link. Once the children are taken care of, the entire link element is moved to the bulleted list using appendChild on a newly created list element  li , which is then appended to our unordered list  ul . When using cloneNode, especially in a circumstance such as this, you’ll want to pass a parameter of true when cloning the node:  var newElement = oldElement.cloneNode true ;  This ensures that all of the node’s children are also cloned in place, in addition to the element. Once all of the links are processed in the document, the last act is to append the unordered list to the end of the document. Figure 12-3 shows the web page after the JavaScript is finished. The application works with all the book’s target browsers. It doesn’t work with IE7, because that browser version does not support the querySelectorAll method.  12.12  Adding Rows to an Existing Table Problem You want to add one or more rows to an HTML table. Solution Adding table rows isn’t complicated, but depending on the size of the table, it can be tedious. For each table cell, you have to create a textNode for the value, append the value to a new td element, append the element to a new tr element, and then append the whole thing to the table:  var table = document.getElementById "targettable" ;  var tr = document.createElement "tr" ; var td = document.createElement "td" ;  12.12  Adding Rows to an Existing Table  257   var txt = document.createTextNode "some value" ;  td.appendChild txt ; tr.appendChild td ; table.appendChild tr ;  Figure 12-3. Web page after application has pulled all in-page links to a separate bulleted list  Discussion Usually, when we’re creating table rows it’s because we’ve received data back from an Ajax function call. Typically, the data is organized in such a way that we can use loops of some form to process the data and simplify the process. Example 12-4 demonstrates how for loops can be used to process data in arrays, and to create all the necessary table elements.  Example 12-4. Extracting data from arrays and creating and appending table rows       Sum Table Column    window.onload=function   {    var values = new Array 3 ;   values[0] = [123.45, "apple", true];   values[1] = [65, "banana", false];   values[2] = [1034.99, "cherry", false];  258  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes     var mixed = document.getElementById "mixed" ;       IE7 only supports appending rows to tbody   var tbody = document.createElement "tbody" ;       for each outer array row   for  var i = 0 ; i < values.length; i++  {      var tr = document.createElement "tr" ;          for each inner array cell         create td then text, append      for  var j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++  {        var td = document.createElement "td" ;        var txt = document.createTextNode values[i][j] ;        td.appendChild txt ;        tr.appendChild td ;      }          append row to table         IE7 requires append row to tbody, append tbody to table      tbody.appendChild tr ;      mixed.appendChild tbody ;    }  }             Value One  Value two  Value three        The data for the table is in static arrays, but could easily be XML or JSON returned from an Ajax call. To repeat, the steps to create and add a table row are:  1. Create the table row  tr . 2. For each table cell, create a table cell element  td . 3. For each table cell, create a text node for its data, and set the data. 4. Append the text node to the table cell. 5. Append the table cell to the table row. 6. When all of the table cells have been appended to the table row, append the table  row to the tbody element, and the tbody element to the table.  The application includes support for creating a tbody element and appending the table rows to this element, which is then appended to the table. IE7 does not allow for direct  12.12  Adding Rows to an Existing Table  259   appending  of  table  rows  to  the  table.  IE8  does,  though,  as  do  the  other  supported browsers. See Also Working with XML- and JSON-formatted data is covered in Chapter 19.  12.13  Removing a Paragraph from a div Element Problem You want to remove a paragraph from the web page. Solution You need to find the paragraph’s parent and use the removeChild method to remove the paragraph:  var para = document.getElementById "thepara" ; para.parentNode.removeChild para ;  Discussion The DOM removeChild method removes the element from the display and the DOM tree. The element still remains in memory, though, and you can capture a reference to the element when you make the removeChild call:  var oldpara = paraParent.removeChild child ;  Example 12-5 demonstrates how to remove paragraphs from the page. When the page is  first  loaded,  all  of  the  paragraphs  are  accessed  via  getElementsByTagName  and  the onclick event handler for each assigned to the pruneParagraph function. The pruneParagraph function references the element that received the click event, finds its parent node, and then removes the paragraph. You can continue to click paragraphs until they’re all gone. After the paragraph is removed, the paragraphs in the page are queried again, and their count printed out.  Example 12-5. Removing paragraph elements from the page       removeChild    p {    padding: 20px;    margin: 10px 0;    width: 400px;    background-color: eeeeff; }  260  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes        window.onload=function   {     var paras = document.getElementsByTagName "p" ;    for  var i = 0; i < paras.length; i++       paras[i].onclick=pruneparagraph; }  function pruneparagraph   {   var parent = this.parentNode;   parent.removeChild this ;    alert "paras " + document.getElementsByTagName "p" .length ; }             This is paragraph one      This is paragraph two      This is paragraph three      This is paragraph four      This is paragraph five     Figure 12-4 shows the page after the second and fourth paragraphs have been removed. Notice that the paragraphs that follow the removed elements move to fill in the space newly freed.  Figure 12-4. Page with two paragraphs removed  12.13  Removing a Paragraph from a div Element   261   12.14  Deleting Rows from an HTML Table Problem You want to remove one or more rows from an HTML table. Solution You can use the DOM removeChild method on an HTML table row, and all of the child elements, such as the table cells, will also be removed:  var parent = row.parentNode; var oldrow = parent.removeChild parent ;  Discussion When you remove an element from the web document, you’re not only removing the element, you’re removing all child elements. You can also get a reference to the removed element if you want to process its contents before it’s completely discarded. The latter is helpful if you want to provide an undo method in case the person accidentally selects the wrong table row. To demonstrate the nature of DOM pruning, Example 12-6 is a modification of Ex- ample 12-4, except that before each new table row is added, the tr element’s onclick event handler is assigned to a function. When any of the new table rows is clicked, it’s removed from the table. The removed table row element is then traversed and the data in its cells is extracted and concatenated to a string, which is then printed out.  Example 12-6. Adding and removing table rows and associated table cells and data       Adding and Removing Elements    table {    border-collapse: collapse; } td, th {    padding: 5px;    border: 1px solid ccc; } tr:nth-child 2n+1  {    background-color: eeffee; }     window.onload=function   {    var values = new Array 3 ;   values[0] = [123.45, "apple", true];   values[1] = [65, "banana", false];  262  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes     values[2] = [1034.99, "cherry", false];    var mixed = document.getElementById "mixed" ;       IE 7 requires tbody   var tbody = document.createElement "tbody" ;       for each outer array row   for  var i = 0 ; i < values.length; i++  {      var tr = document.createElement "tr" ;          for each inner array cell         create td then text, append      for  var j = 0; j < values[i].length; j++  {        var td = document.createElement "td" ;        var txt = document.createTextNode values[i][j] ;        td.appendChild txt ;        tr.appendChild td ;      }          attache event handler      tr.onclick=prunerow;          append row to table      tbody.appendChild tr ;      mixed.appendChild tbody ;    } }  function prunerow   {   var parent = this.parentNode;   var oldrow = parent.removeChild this ;    var datastring = "";   for  var i = 0; i < oldrow.childNodes.length; i++  {     var cell = oldrow.childNodes[i];     datastring+=cell.firstChild.data + " ";   }    alert "removed " + datastring ; }            Value One  Value two  Value three        The example demonstrates that it’s a whole lot simpler to prune the DOM tree than to grow new branches.  12.14  Deleting Rows from an HTML Table  263   See Also Example 12-4 can be found in Recipe 12.12.  12.15  Changing the Element’s CSS Style Properties Problem You want to modify one or more CSS properties for an element. Solution If you’re only modifying a single property, you can change the CSS setting directly using the element’s style property:  var elem = document.getElementById "elem" ; elem.style.width = "500px";  If you’re modifying one or more values, you can use the element’s setAttribute method:  elem.setAttribute "style","width: 500px; background-color: yellow;" ;  Discussion An element’s CSS properties can be modified in JavaScript using one of two approaches. As the solution demonstrates, the simplest approach is to set the property’s value di- rectly using the element’s style property:  elem.style.width = "500px";  If the CSS property contains a hyphen, such as font-family or background-color, use a CamelCase notation for the property: elem.style.fontFamily = "Courier"; elem.style.backgroundColor = "rgb 255,0,0 ";  You can also use the element’s setAttribute method to set the style property: elem.setAttribute "style","font-family: Courier; background-color: yellow" ;  However, when you set the style property using setAttribute, it erases any previously set values in the JavaScript. Example 12-7 demonstrates how the style-setting techniques work, including the im- pact of using setAttribute. Various techniques are used to set and get style attributes, including a cross-browser approach to access the computed style for the attribute.  Example 12-7. Demonstrating setting and retrieving CSS style settings       Changing style     264  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes     elem {   width: 200px; background-color: lime; }      function getStyle elem, cssprop, cssprop2 {      IE  if  elem.currentStyle  {    return elem.currentStyle[cssprop];      other browsers  } else if  document.defaultView &&                    document.defaultView.getComputedStyle  {    return document.defaultView.getComputedStyle elem, null .getPropertyValue cssprop2 ;      fallback  } else {    return null;  } } window.onload=function   {        setting and accessing style properties    var elem = document.getElementById "elem" ;     var color = getStyle elem,"backgroundColor", "background-color" ;    alert color ;    rgb 0,255,0      elem.style.width = "500px";    elem.style.backgroundColor="yellow";     alert elem.style.width ;    500px    alert elem.style.backgroundColor ;    yellow        array notation    elem.style["fontFamily"] = "Courier";        demonstrating overwriting properties    var style = elem.getAttribute "style" ;    alert style ;    should display color: purple; width: 500px;                     background-color: yellow;     elem.setAttribute "style","height: 100px" ;    var style = elem.getAttribute "style" ;    alert style ;    now only displays height, resets styles     var font = getStyle elem,"fontFamily", "font-family" ;    alert font ;    default font family  12.15  Changing the Element’s CSS Style Properties   265   }         testing      As soon as the page loads, the div element is accessed using getElementById, and its background-color is retrieved using a cross-browser function that gets the computed style for the attribute. The message output is “rgb 0,255,0 ”, representing the lime color set in the page’s stylesheet. Next, two CSS properties are set using the element’s style property: the width and background-color. Now the div element has a yellow background and is 500, rather than 200, pixels wide. Both of the modified values are accessed and printed out, so we can confirm that yes, the values have changed. Next, the font-family for the element is set to Courier, using the array notation, which is another approach you can use to set and get style property values. Now the  div element is 500 pixels wide, with a yellow background, and its font family is Courier. The style property is accessed using getAttribute. A string of the values set using the style property is returned for all browsers:  color: purple; width: 500px; background-color: yellow; font-family: Courier;  The purple font color is set inline within a style attribute in the div element. Next, I’m using the setAttribute method to change the element’s height. A couple of things happen when I used the setAttribute method in the example. The height of the element is changed to 100 pixels, but the previously set style properties  color, width, background-color, and font-family  have been “erased,” and revert back to the original settings in the stylesheet, or the defaults by the user agent. The element is now 200 pixels wide, 100 pixels tall, with a green background, and the font reverts back to the default font for the browser  typically a serif value , and the default font color, black. As you can see, using setAttribute to change the style element property can signifi- cantly impact on previous settings, including any inline CSS settings. You should only use setAttribute if you’re changing many values at once, and you don’t use any inline style  attributes  or  haven’t  modified  the  element’s  style  settings  previously  in  your application. The effects demonstrated in this recipe work the same with all of the book’s target browsers, except for IE7. The style property is an actual object in IE7, so when you access style with getAttribute, you’ll get an object, not a string. Since it is an object, it’s read only, which means you can’t use setAttribute with IE7.  266  Chapter 12: Creating and Removing Elements and Attributes   See Also See  Recipe  11.13  for  more  information  about  accessing  the  computed  style  for  an element.  12.15  Changing the Element’s CSS Style Properties   267    CHAPTER 13 Working with Web Page Spaces  13.0  Introduction The web page space is all of the area contained within the browser’s chrome: the outer edge of the browser, status, and menu bars. If the contents of the page are larger than the window area, vertical and horizontal scrollbars are added so you can scroll to see all of the page contents. The web page size is determined by the page elements, in combination with the default and explicit styling for each. If there are no elements, or the elements don’t participate in the page flow  if they’re absolutely positioned, or in some other way removed from the flow , the area of the web page space is the size of the window minus the chrome. Element sizes vary, based on their contents, but they can be resized or even clipped. If they are resized, setting the element’s overflow alters what happens to their content if it is larger than the element’s size. If the overflow is set to scroll, vertical and hori- zontal scrollbars are added to the element. How the elements impact page flow is based on a number of factors. For instance, if the element is a block-level element, such as a div, header  h1 , or paragraph  p , there’s a new line before and after the element. An inline element, though, such as a span, is not surrounded by line breaks. The display for both types of elements can be changed by setting the CSS display or float property. An element’s positioning can also impact page flow. By default, elements have static positioning,  where  properties  such  as  top  and  left  have  no  impact.  An  element’s position can be changed through the CSS position property, and through the use of positional properties such as left and top—either changing the element’s position in the page, or removing it entirely out of the page flow. All of the element properties just mentioned can be set in a stylesheet:    divtest {    position: absolute;  269      left: 10px;    top: 10px; }  In this chapter, we’re more interested in the many ways of using JavaScript to dynam- ically manage the web page’s space.  13.1  Determining the Area of the Web Page Problem You want to measure the width and height of the current web page window. Solution You’ll need to use a cross-browser technique that ensures consistent results regardless of the browser used. The following is an example of a function that returns an object with the web page viewport’s width and height:  function size   {   var wdth = 0;   var hth = 0;    if !window.innerWidth    {      wdth =  document.documentElement.clientWidth ? document.documentElement.clientWidth : document.body.clientWidth ;      hth =  document.documentElement.clientHeight ? document.documentElement.clientWidth : document.body.clientHeight ;   }   else   {     wdth = window.innerWidth;     hth = window.innerHeight;   }   return {width:wdth, height:hth}; }  Discussion There is currently no standard approach to accessing the window viewport informa- tion, which is why we have to use a series of case statements. Most major browsers, including Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, support window object properties called innerWidth and innerHeight, which return the window’s view- port area, minus any scrollbar dimensions. However, Internet Explorer doesn’t support innerWidth and innerHeight, which accounts for the first test case in the solution.  270  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces   If the innerWidth property is supported, the width and height are accessed from inner Width and innerHeight, respectively. If it isn’t supported, the ternary operator is used to test for a document property, documentView, and its property, clientWidth. If there is no documentView object, the clientWidth property is accessed on the document body property:  wdth =  document.documentElement.clientWidth ?               document.documentElement.clientWidth :               document.body.clientWidth ;  IE provides viewport information through the  documentView property except in IE6, when the application is run in quirks mode. Though support for IE6 is rapidly dimin- ishing—major websites such as Google, YouTube, and Amazon no longer support it, and it isn’t one of the supported browsers in this book—I’ve included the test to be comprehensive.  Quirks mode is a way for browsers to provide backward version support. It’s typically triggered with a special DOCTYPE, such as: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN">.  After the tests, both the width and height values are assigned to appropriately named properties in a returned object, using JSON notation:  return {width:wdth, height: hth}  Once the viewport size object is returned, you can access the width and height using the following code:  var viewPort = size  ; var w = viewPort.width; var h = viewPort.height;  See Also There is a draft for a CSS3 standards effort to define a CSSOM View module, in order to provide a standard set of CSS specifications for window viewports and other di- mensional and view information. The current draft is at http:  www.w3.org TR cssom -view . However, the priority for this specification is low, and the cross-browser ap- proach just demonstrated is widely adopted, so a standard approach is off in the distant future. See Recipe 19.4 for more on the JSON notation.  13.1  Determining the Area of the Web Page  271   13.2  Measuring Elements Problem You want to determine the current height of a web page element. Solution Call  getBoundingClientRect  for  the  element.  If  the  returned  TextRectangle  ClientRect object has a height property, use that. Otherwise, subtract the rectangle’s bottom value from its top to derive the height:  var height = 0; var rect = document.getElementById "it" .getBoundingClientRect  ; if  rect.height  {     height = rect.height; } else {     height = rect.bottom - rect.height;    derive height } alert rect.height ;  Discussion The getBoundingClientRect method is based on a method that Microsoft implemented for IE5, and is now being standardized in the W3C CSSOM View module. The W3C CSSOM View module specification provides a standardized way of getting information about  the  web  page  viewport,  and  the  element’s  spatial  arrangement  within  the viewport. The element.getBoundingClientRect method returns a ClientRect object  TextRectan gle in implementations  that contains information about the bounding rectangle for the element. Most implementations support four properties on the object: top, bottom, right, and left. Firefox also includes width and height, though both can be derived from the other values. When I mention the bounding rectangle for the element, the dimensions returned in- clude any padding and border values. If an element has the following stylesheet setting:  and you access the bounding rectangle’s height, it is 400 pixels. However, if the element has the following stylesheet:  elem {    height: 400px;  }  elem {   height: 400px;   padding: 10px;   border: 5px solid red;  272  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces     margin: 20px; }  the bounding rectangle’s height would be 430 pixels: 400 for the height setting, plus 10 pixels each side for the padding, and 5 pixels each side for the border. The margin doesn’t figure into the calculation. If you don’t provide any stylesheet setting, the height depends on the viewport size; changing the viewport will also change the element’s dimensions, including its height. The  values  for  each  of  the  ClientRect TextRectangle  dimensions  are  floating-point numbers.  Another impact on the element’s bounding rectangle position is if it’s in a foreignObject element in embedded SVG, in which case the top- left is relative to foreignObject’s container and other contents.  13.3  Locating Elements in the Page Problem You want to know the exact position of an element in the page. Solution Use getBoundingClientRect to get the dimensions and position of the bounding rec- tangle for the element, and then access its top and left values to find position:  function positionObject obj  {    var rect = obj.getBoundingClientRect  ;    return [rect.left,rect.top]; }  Discussion Element positioning is based on the position, or offset, of the element’s top-left corner relative to its viewport and ancestor elements. The position of the element is relative to other elements, and is dependent on whether its position is static  by default , rela- tive, fixed, or absolute. The margin also affects the element’s position. The element.getBoundingClientRect method returns the rectangle for the element, in- cluding the top, left, right, and bottom positions, regardless of stylesheet setting. To  demonstrate  how  the  method  can  be  used  to  find  element  positions,  Exam- ple 13-1 contains a web page with three nested div elements and a separate div element acting as cursor. Each nested div element is labeled and outlined, and the separate element is a solid color. When the page loads, the user is prompted for a box label, and  13.3  Locating Elements in the Page  273   if the label matches one of the div elements, the solid cursor div element is positioned over the specified div element. The prompt move continues until canceled.  Example 13-1. Moving elements over others based on location position and absolute positioning       Locating Elements    diva {    width: 500px; } div {   border: 1px solid 000;   padding: 10px; } cursor {   position: absolute;   background-color: ffff00;   width: 20px;   height: 20px;   left: 50px;   top: 300px; }      function positionObject obj  {    var rect = obj.getBoundingClientRect  ;    return [rect.left,rect.top]; } window.onload=function   {    var tst = document.documentElement.getBoundingClientRect  ;    alert tst.top ;    var cont = "A";    var cursor = document.getElementById "cursor" ;    while  cont  {       cont = prompt "Where do you want to move the cursor block?",                          "A" ;       if  cont  {          cont=cont.toLowerCase  ;          if  cont == "a"  cont == "b"  cont == "c"  {             var elem = document.getElementById cont ;             var pos = positionObject elem ;             cursor.setAttribute "style","top: " + pos[1] +                                      "px; left : " + pos[0] + "px" ;           }        }     } }      274  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces              A               B                    C                             Figure 13-1 shows the page after I selected the “B” div element. The application works with all of this book’s target browsers.  Figure 13-1. Showing element position in action  An interesting little quirk with getBoundingClientRect and positioning is that Microsoft originally added a two-pixel margin around the document element, which affected the getBoundingClientRect values. If you test the method with the document element:  var tst = document.documentElement.getBoundingClientRect  ; alert tst.top ;  You get a value of 0 for Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera, but you get a value of 2 for IE7, and –2 for IE8. If you run the application in IE7 compatibility mode and re- position the cursor element using code that’s compatible for IE7  IE7 doesn’t like the setAttribute technique when used with the style attribute :  var pos = positionObject elem ; cursor.style.top = pos[1] + "px"; cursor.style.left = pos[0] + "px";  The cursor is exactly 2 pixels off—both from the top and the left. With IE8, Microsoft “regularized” the margin for the document element, offsetting it –2 pixels. Now, when you use getBoundingClientRect with any element in the page, IE8 returns the same results as the other browsers.  13.3  Locating Elements in the Page  275   If  you  need  to  support  IE7,  you’ll  need  to  adjust  the  getBoundingClientRect  values accordingly, and also use the older approach of setting style values. The downloadable example code contains a workaround for this older browser. See Also See Recipe 12.15 for more on using setAttribute to change style settings.  13.4  Hiding Page Sections Problem You want to hide an existing page element and its children until needed. Solution You can set the CSS visibility property to hide and show the message:  msg.style.hidden="visible";    to display msg.style.hidden="hidden";    to hide  or you can use the CSS display property: msg.style.display="block";    to display msg.style.display="none";    to remove from display  Discussion Both the CSS visibility and display properties can be used to hide and show elements. There is one major difference between the two that impacts on which you’ll use. The visibility property controls the element’s visual rendering, but its physical pres- ence still affects other elements. When an element is hidden, it still takes up page space. The display property, on the other hand, removes the element completely from the page layout. The property can take several values, but there are four of interest to us:  none  block  inline-block  inherit  When display is set to none, the element is removed completely from display.  When display is set to block, the element is treated like a block element, with a line break before and after.  When display is set to inline-block, the contents are formatted like a block ele- ment, which is then flowed like inline content.  This is the default display, and specifies that the display property is inherited from the element’s parent.  276  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces   There are other values, but these are the ones we’re most likely to use within JavaScript applications. Unless you’re using absolute positioning with the hidden element, you’ll want to use the CSS display property. Otherwise, the element will affect the page layout, pushing any  elements  that  follow  down  and  to  the  right,  depending  on  the  type  of  hidden element. There is another approach to removing an element out of page view, and that is to move it totally offscreen using a negative left value. This could work, especially if you’re creating a slider element that will slide in from the left. It’s also an approach that the accessibility community has suggested using when you have content that you want rendered by Assistive Technology  AT  devices, but not visually rendered. To just hide an element, I generally use the hidden attribute, and to remove the element from the page display, I use the display attribute. See Also See Recipe 14.1 on accessible approaches to hiding and displaying page elements. See Recipe 13.4 for a demonstration of the display attribute.  13.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections Problem You have a large form that takes up a lot of space. You only want to display sections of the form as they are needed. Solution Split the form into display blocks using  div elements, and then change the block’s styling to control the display of the form section. When the page is loaded, hide all of the form blocks by changing the display value to none using JavaScript:  theformblock.setAttribute "style","display: none" ;  To expand the section, change the display setting to block using setAttribute:  or:  theformblock.style.display="none";  theformblock.setAttribute "style","block" ;  or set the value directly:  theformblock.style.display="block";  13.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections   277   Discussion There are multiple ways you can prevent form elements from taking up page space. For one, you can clip the element by setting the clipping area. Another approach is to resize the element to zero height. The best approach, though, and the one most applications use, is to employ a collapsible section. A collapsible section is a form of widget—a set of elements, CSS, and JavaScript pack- aged together and generally considered one object. The typical implementation consists of one element that acts as a label that is always displayed, another element that holds the content, and all contained within a third, parent element. The collapsible section may or may not be used with other collapsible sections to form a higher level widget, the accordion. The accordion widget is a grouping of collapsible sections with an additional behavior: depending on preference, any number of col- lapsible sections can be expanded, or only one section can be expanded at a time. To demonstrate how collapsible sections can be used with forms, Example 13-2 shows a form that’s split into two sections. Notice that each form block has an associated label that expands the collapsed form section when clicked. When the label is clicked again, the form section is collapsed again.  Example 13-2. Collapsed form element       Collapsed Form Elements    .label {   width: 400px;   margin: 10px 0 0 0;   padding: 10px;   background-color: ccccff;   text-align: center;   border: 1px solid ccccff; } .elements {   border: 1px solid ccccff;   padding: 10px;   border: 1px solid ccccff;   width: 400px; } button {    margin: 20px; }              278  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces                Checkboxes                      - box one          - box one          - box one          - box one          - box one                             Buttons                - button one        - button one        - button one        - button one        - button one       Submit             var elements = document.getElementsByTagName "div" ;     collapse all sections for  var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {   if  elements[i].className == "elements"  {     elements[i].style.display="none";   } else if  elements[i].className == "label"  {     elements[i].onclick=switchDisplay;   } }    collapse or expand depending on state function switchDisplay   {    var parent = this.parentNode;   var target = parent.getElementsByTagName "div" [1];    if  target.style.display == "none"  {     target.style.display="block";   } else {     target.style.display="none";   }   return false; }      13.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections   279   There are numerous ways you can map the click activity in one element by changing the display in another. In Example 13-2, I wrapped both the label and the content elements in a parent element. When you click on a label, the parent to the label element is accessed in JavaScript and its children returned as an HTML collection. The second element’s  display  toggles—if  the  element’s  display  is  none,  it’s  changed  to  block;  if block, changed to none. Figure 13-2 shows the page, with one form section expanded.  Figure 13-2. Form split over collapsible accordion sections, with one section expanded  In the example, notice that the form elements are displayed when the page loads, and only collapsed after the elements are loaded. The reason for this is if JavaScript is turned off, the form elements are displayed by default. See Also See Recipe 14.5 for how to make a collapsible section accordion widget accessible with ARIA attributes.  280  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces   13.6  Adding a Page Overlay Problem You want to overlay the web page in order to display a message, or provide an expanded photo. Solution Provide a stylesheet setting for a div element that is sized and positioned to cover the entire web page:  .overlay {    background-color: 000;    opacity: .7;    filter: alpha opacity=70 ;    position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;    width: 100%; height: 100%;    z-index: 10; }  Create the div element on demand, adding whatever other content is to be displayed  to the div element:function expandPhoto   {     var overlay = document.createElement "div" ;    overlay.setAttribute "id","overlay" ;    overlay.setAttribute "class", "overlay" ;    document.body.appendChild overlay ; }  When the overlay is no longer needed, remove it from the page:  function restore   {    document.body.removeChild document.getElementById "overlay"  ; }  Discussion Creating an overlay in a web page consists of creating a div element set to a z-index higher than anything else in the page, absolutely positioned at the upper left of the page, and sized 100%. In  the  solution,  this  is  achieved  more  easily  by  created  a  CSS  style  setting  for  the overlay  class  that  manages  the  appearance  of  the  element,  and  then  using  docu ment.createElement and appendChild to add it to the page. To restore the page, the overlay element is removed. Page overlays are popular for displaying ads, logins, or providing important site mes- sages. They are also useful with photos. Example 13-3 contains a web page with four photo thumbnails. Clicking any of the thumbnails opens an overlay, and displays a larger size photo.  13.6  Adding a Page Overlay  281   Example 13-3. Creating an overlay for displaying a larger photo       Overlay    img {   padding: 5px; }  outer {   width: 100%; height: 100%; } .overlay {    background-color: 000;    opacity: .7;    filter: alpha opacity=70 ;    position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0;    width: 100%; height: 100%;    z-index: 10; } .overlayimg {   position: absolute;   z-index: 11;   left: 50px;   top: 50px; }      function expandPhoto   {        create overlay and append to page    var overlay = document.createElement "div" ;    overlay.setAttribute "id","overlay" ;    overlay.setAttribute "class", "overlay" ;    document.body.appendChild overlay ;        create image and append to page    var img = document.createElement "img" ;    img.setAttribute "id","img" ;    img.src = this.getAttribute "data-larger" ;    img.setAttribute "class","overlayimg" ;        click to restore page    img.onclick=restore;     document.body.appendChild img ;  }    restore page to normal function restore   {  282  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces    document.body.removeChild document.getElementById "overlay"  ;  document.body.removeChild document.getElementById "img"  ; }  window.onload=function   {    var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName "img" ;    imgs[0].focus  ;    for  var i = 0; i < imgs.length; i++  {      imgs[i].onclick=expandPhoto;      imgs[i].onkeydown=expandPhoto;    } }              Mouse click on image to expand the photo. To close expanded photo, mouse click on image.    <img src="dragonfly2.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly2.jpg" alt="image of common dragonfly on bright green and pink flowers"  >   <img src="dragonfly4.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly4.jpg" alt="Dark orange dragonfly on water lily"  >   <img src="dragonfly6.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly6.jpg" alt="Dark orange dragonfly on purple water lily"  >   <img src="dragonfly8.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly8.jpg" alt="Dragonfly on bright pink water lily"  >      Example 13-3 creates an overlay that fits the size of the page as it’s currently opened. Note the CSS setting for the overlay, in particular the fixed positioning. This ensures that the overlay fits the window even if the contents require you to scroll to the right, or down, to see all of the contents. Figure 13-3 shows the page with the overlay and one of the photos displayed. The application works with Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, and IE8. IE7 doesn’t like the use of setAttribute with the class attribute. If you need to support IE7, set the className attribute directly:  overlay.className = "overlay";  See Also See Recipe 12.15 for more on using setAttribute with CSS styles.  13.6  Adding a Page Overlay  283   Figure 13-3. Demonstration of an overlap and photo  13.7  Creating Tab Pages Problem You have divided content that you want to hide or display based on the web page reader’s actions. Solution Create a tabbed page effect and hide or display tab pages based on clicking the tab label:     click on tab function displayPage   {   var current = this.parentNode.getAttribute "data-current" ;   document.getElementById "tabnav_" + current .setAttribute "style",                           "background-color: fff" ;   document.getElementById "tabpage_" + current .style.display="none";    var ident = this.id.split "_" [1];   this.setAttribute "style","background-color: f00" ;   document.getElementById "tabpage_" + ident .style.display="block";   this.parentNode.setAttribute "data-current",ident ; }  284  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces   Discussion Tabbed pages have been popular for some time, and rightfully so. They’re a great way to make use of limited web page space in a manner that’s intuitive—we’re all familiar with tabs from other applications, including browsers. The tabbed page concept is simple: display a list of tabs to click on the top, and pages underneath. All tabs are shown, but only one page is shown at a time. Clicking any of the tabs resets the page:    The highlighted tab is changed to the one just clicked.   The currently displayed page is hidden or set to nondisplay.   The clicked tab’s style is changed  so it’s highlighted .   The associated content page is displayed.  In the solution, part of a tabbed page application is shown: the part that demonstrates what happens when you click the tab. In this case, the tab is associated by an identifier number attached to the end of the tab identifier for the associated tab page, so there doesn’t have to be any form of container relation between the two. You want to avoid a container relationship between tab and page as much as possible, because it makes it difficult to ensure the page displays well when JavaScript is turned off. The  current  tab  picked  is  stored  in  the  parent  node’s  custom  data  attribute,  data- current. Using a custom data-* attribute, as these values are called, means we can avoid global variables. The next time a tab is clicked, it’s easy to find the current selection in order to reset the page.  The custom data-* attributes were introduced with HTML5. You can use any name that begins with data-, and the page is still considered conforming to HTML5.  There are probably dozens of different approaches you can use to create tabbed pages, including making your own library, or using another that can be dropped into a page to automatically build the pages based on class settings. The approach in Example 13-4 incorporates the approach outlined in the solution. It also makes use of the fact that elements form their own document trees, and that we can query an element tree the same as we can query the document tree. Using this approach, we can add as many tabbed page containers to the page as we wish. For each container, the application displays the navigation bar, turns off the display for all of the pages except the first, and highlights the first tab, and then adds the onclick event handler to each tab.  13.7  Creating Tab Pages   285   Example 13-4.

Solution The Netflix-style of pop-up info window is based on four different functionalities. First, you need to capture the mouseover and mouseout events for each image thumbnail, in order to display or remove the pop-up window, respectively. Using a function that manages cross-browser event handling for every object that has an info bubble, assign a function to both the onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers. In the following code, the event handlers are attached to all images in the page:  function manageEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } }  window.onload=function   {   var imgs = document.getElementsByTagName "img" ;   for  var i = 0; i < imgs.length; i++  {      manageEvent imgs[i],"mouseover",getInfo ;      manageEvent imgs[i],"mouseout",removeWindow ;   } }  Second, you need to access something about the item you’re hovering over in order to know what to use to populate the pop-up bubble. The information can be in the page, or you can use Ajax to get the information:  function getInfo   {       prepare request   if  !xmlhttp  {     xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   }   var value = this.getAttribute "id" ;  13.8  Creating Hover-Based Pop-up Info Windows   289     var url = "photos.php?photo=" + value;   xmlhttp.open 'GET', url, true ;   xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = showWindow;   xmlhttp.send null ;    return false; }  Third, you need to either show the pop-up window, if it already exists and is not dis- played, or create the window. In the following code, the pop-up window is created just below the object, and just to the right when the Ajax call returns with the information about the item. The element.getBoundingClientRect method is used to determine the location where the pop up should be placed, and the DOM methods document.crea teElement and document.createTextNode are used to create the pop up:     compute position for pop up function compPos obj  {     var rect = obj.getBoundingClientRect  ;     var height;     if  rect.height  {       height = rect.height;     } else {       height = rect.bottom - rect.top;     }     var top = rect.top + height + 10;     return [rect.left, top]; }     process return function showWindow   {    if xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200  {      var response = xmlhttp.responseText.split "" ;      var img = document.getElementById response[0] ;       if  !img  return;          derive location for pop up      var loc = compPos img ;      var left = loc[0] + "px";      var top = loc[1] + "px";          create pop up      var div = document.createElement "popup" ;      div.id = "popup";      var txt = document.createTextNode response[1] ;      div.appendChild txt ;          style pop up      div.setAttribute "class","popup" ;      div.setAttribute "style","left: " + left + "; top: " + top ;      document.body.appendChild div ;    } }  290  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces   Lastly, when the mouseover event fires, you need to either hide the pop-up window or remove it—whichever makes sense in your setup. Since I created a new pop-up window in the mouseover event, I’ll remove it in the mouseout event handler:  function removeWindow   {    var popup = document.getElementById "popup" ;    if  popup       popup.parentNode.removeChild popup ;     return false; }  Discussion Creating a pop-up information or help window doesn’t have to be complicated, if you keep the action simple and follow the four steps outlined in the solution. If the pop up is help for form elements, then you might want to cache the information within the page, and just show and hide pop-up elements as needed. However, if you have pages like the ones at Netflix, which can have hundreds of items, you’ll have better perform- ance if you get the pop-up window information on demand using Ajax. The solution demonstrates  that  using  Ajax  doesn’t  add  significant  additional  complexity  to  the application. When I positioned the pop up in the example, I didn’t place it directly over the object, as shown in Figure 13-5. The reason is that I’m not capturing the mouse position to have the pop up follow the cursor around, ensuring that I don’t move the cursor directly over the pop up. But if I statically position the pop up partially over the object, the web page readers could move their mouse over the pop up, which triggers the event to hide the pop up...which then triggers the event to show the pop up, and so on. This creates a flicker effect, not to mention a lot of network activity. If, instead, I allowed the mouse events to continue by returning true from either event handler function, when the web page readers move their mouse over the pop up, the pop up won’t go away. However, if they move the mouse from the image to the pop up, and then to the rest of the page, the event to trigger the pop-up event removal won’t fire, and the pop up is left on the page. The best approach is to place the pop up directly under  or to the side, or a specific location in the page  rather than directly over the object. This is the approach Netflix uses on its site. IE7 doesn’t like the use of setAttribute with the class or style attributes. To modify the code so it also works with IE7, replace the setAttribute with:     IE7 div.className="popup"; div.style.left=left; div.style.top = top;  13.8  Creating Hover-Based Pop-up Info Windows   291   Figure 13-5. Demonstrating a pop-up mouseover information window See Also See Recipes 13.2 and 13.3 for more information about using element.getBoundingClien tRect. Chapter 12 provides coverage of creating new page elements, and Chapter 18 of using Ajax. Recipe 12.15 covers using setAttribute with CSS style settings.  13.9  Collapsing or Resizing the Sidebar Problem You have a website that has a main column and one or more side columns, as shown in Figure 13-6. You want to provide a way for your web page readers to control the width of the main column, without having to resize the browser. Solution Use a collapsible sidebar. Add an X in a span element at the top of the sidebar. Include a custom data-expand attribute set to "true", to track whether the column is expanded or not. Also include tabindex="0", so that the element can receive keypress events:           292  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces    X   Collapse sidebar      Figure 13-6. Collapsible sidebar page before sidebar is collapsed  Add a method handler to the element’s click and keypress events that checks the data- expand attribute to see if the column is currently expanded or not. If it is expanded, the column is collapsed, and the main column expanded; if not, the sidebar and main column are returned to their regular dimensions:  window.onload=function   {   var x = document.getElementById "x" ;  x.setAttribute "style","display: block" ;  x.onclick=expandOrShrink;  x.onkeypress=expandOrShrink; }  function expandOrShrink   {    if  this.getAttribute "data-expand"  == "true"  {       document.getElementById "sidebar" .setAttribute "style",              "width: 50px" ;       document.getElementById "main" .setAttribute "style",              "width: 700px" ;       this.setAttribute "data-expand", "false" ;    } else {       document.getElementById "sidebar" .setAttribute "style",               "width: 240px" ;  13.9  Collapsing or Resizing the Sidebar   293         document.getElementById "main" .setAttribute "style",               "width: 500px" ;       this.setAttribute "data-expand", "true" ;    } }  Discussion Working with page space doesn’t mean that the JavaScript has to be complex or in- volved. The collapsible sidebar is very simple. The key to making it work is to ensure that the sidebar contents are clipped when the sidebar is shrunk  as shown in Fig- ure 13-7 , rather than overflowing the sidebar dimensions.  Figure 13-7. Collapsible sidebar page after sidebar is collapsed  To ensure the page works if JavaScript is disabled, the default CSS for the X element is set to display none. When the page loads, JavaScript changes the X to display. Since IE7 doesn’t like the use of setAttribute with the style attribute, you can modify the application to support this older browser by using direct attribute assignment:  function expandOrShrink   {    if  this.getAttribute "data-expand"  == "true"  {       document.getElementById "sidebar" .setAttribute "style",                 "width: 50px" ;       document.getElementById "main" .setAttribute "style",                 "width: 700px" ;  294  Chapter 13: Working with Web Page Spaces            IE7          document.getElementById "sidebar" .style.width="50px";          document.getElementById "main" .style.width="700px";        this.setAttribute "data-expand", "false" ;    } else {       document.getElementById "sidebar" .setAttribute "style",                  "width: 240px" ;       document.getElementById "main" .setAttribute "style",                  "width: 500px" ;           IE7          document.getElementById "sidebar" .style.width="240px";          document.getElementById "main" .style.width="500px";        this.setAttribute "data-expand", "true" ;    } }  IE7  does  support  the  use  of  getAttribute  and  setAttribute  with  custom  data-* attributes.  13.9  Collapsing or Resizing the Sidebar   295    CHAPTER 14 Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA  14.0  Introduction Using JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enable more interactive web pages has been around for over a decade. We’ve used the techniques to provide just-in-time help when people  are  submitting  forms,  highlight  page  sections,  cue  the  users  that  something important has happened, or respond to mouse hover events. These venerable techniques are now joined with a new capability: Accessible Rich In- ternet Applications  ARIA , a set of accessibility attributes that add accessibility to Rich Internet Applications. This chapter is going to focus on classic interactive JavaScript techniques used across most of the Web, and requiring only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. They’ll be freshened for modern times with the use of the ARIA functionality. Byte for byte, the effects described in this chapter can provide the most impact with the least effort. Best of all, the effects described in this chapter are probably the most cross-browser-friendly techniques in use today. They’re certainly the most user-friendly techniques available. The examples in this chapter work in all of the book’s target browsers. To test the screen-reader-specific accessibility components, you can install a screen reader that provides a free testing option  such as Windows-Eyes, which allows 30 minutes of testing between reboots , or a free, fully functional screen reader such as NVDA, which unfortunately only works on Windows. The Mac has built-in screen reader support with VoiceOver, but it has only limited ARIA support at this time. The Linux environ- ment has Orca, another free option. When testing for this chapter, I used Firefox 3.5 and NVDA in Windows XP. I’ve long known that accessibility is an important feature for web applications, but I didn’t realize until I was working on the examples for this chapter how fun developing  297   for accessibility can be. Seeing previously silent, verbally unresponsive applications suddenly come alive when I turned on NVDA was rather amazing, and I must confess to going a little crazy trying out as many ARIA roles, relationships, and statuses as I could given the book deadline and size considerations.  The ARIA capabilities are described in a set of documents created via the  WAI-ARIA   Web  Accessibility  Initiative-Accessible  Rich  Internet Applications , an initiative under the auspices of the W3C. For more information on WAI-ARIA, see the WAI-ARIA overview page.  Though much of the effort for accessibility has been focused on those needing to use screen readers, the concept of accessibility covers a broad range of impairments:    Visual impairment, covering complete loss of vision, but can also include partial loss of vision, eye strain, monitors that are too large or too small, color blindness, and fatigue.    Hearing loss, ranging from difficulty in hearing to complete deafness.   Motor impairment, covering complete immobility, where the use of a mouse is impossible, to some fine-motor impairment, where the use of the mouse in coor- dination with the mouse button can be a problem.    Cognitive impairment, covering a range of issues related to reading comprehen- sion, reading ability and experience, memory, as well as experience with devices and with terminology.  As  we  go  through  the  recipes,  I’ll  try  to  tie  what  I’ve  covered  back  to  these  broad groupings. See Also Recipe 7.7 also discusses ARIA related to the drag-and-drop event handling, and the new HTML5 native drag-and-drop support. Two Windows-based commercial screen readers are JAWS and Window-Eyes, both of which  provide  limited  time-based  testing  without  having  to  purchase  the  product. NVDA also works only on Windows, and is free. Orca, which works on Linux, can be found at http:  live.gnome.org Orca. VoiceOver is built-into the Mac environment, and can be controlled via System Preferences→System→Universal Access. A nice overview in how to work with Firefox and NVDA can be found at  Marco’s Accessibility Blog. A good overview on setting up a screen reader test environment can be found at http:  www.iheni.com screen-reader-testing . The WebAIM website provides a good overview of the different forms of disability types.  298  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   14.1  Displaying a Hidden Page Section Problem You want to hide or show a page section, as needed. Solution If there’s a good likelihood of the page section being needed, you can embed it in the page and display it when needed:  var msg = document.getElementById "msg" ; msg.style.display="block"; msg.setAttribute "aria-hidden", "false" ;  and hide it, when not:  var msg = document.getElementById "msg" ; msg.style.display="none"; msg.setAttribute "aria-hidden", "true" ;  Discussion Elements have different CSS display settings, depending on the type of element, and to  some  extent,  the  user  agent.  For  browsers  like  Opera  or  Firefox,  a  span  has  an inline display value, while a div element has a block display value. Regardless of ele- ment type, though, setting the display to none removes the element completely from the document layout. Visually, this means the element is removed from view and does not take up any page space or affect how any other element displays, other than its own child elements. Assistive  Technology  devices  also  understand  and  support  the  display  property, though there are some inconsistencies in AT support. The aria-hidden attribute is a way of providing precise instructions to the AT device: when true, don’t display speak the text; if false, display speak the text. It can be used in combination with the CSS display property to ensure the same result in visual and nonvisual environments. Using aria-hidden with the CSS display property doesn’t require any additional work. If the browser supports attribute selectors, you can set the element’s visual display using the aria-hidden attribute: msg[aria-hidden=true] {    display: none; }  With this CSS, when you change an element’s aria-hidden attribute, you’re also chang- ing the CSS display property.  14.1  Displaying a Hidden Page Section  299   Using this CSS style setting causes IE8 to lock up when it’s running in IE7 compatibility mode.  Being able to hide sections of a page is useful not only for hiding and displaying mes- sages, but also for hiding form elements, especially in a form that has a lot of elements. By hiding sections of the page and displaying them only as needed, you help to create an uncluttered web page. An uncluttered page helps everyone accessing your page, but is especially helpful for those who have cognitive disabilities and who may have chal- lenges comprehending a mess of words and form controls all at once. However, use this functionality with care. Providing a page with labels that a person can click to reveal the form elements underneath is helpful; unexpectedly popping up new controls can both surprise and irritate the user. To ensure the page is always accessible even with JavaScript turned off, set the material you want available to be displayed by default, and hide the sections using JavaScript when the page is loaded. Set the messages you don’t want displayed if JavaScript is disabled to be hidden by default. See Also See Recipe 14.5 for an example of a good implementation of hidden form content.  14.2  Creating an Alert Message Problem You want to alert the reader to important information. Solution Create a visually distinctive alert message in the web page, and ensure it’s noticed by AT devices:  function addPopUp txt  {       remove old alert, in case    var msg = document.getElementById "msg" ;    if  msg        document.body.removeChild msg ;        create new text and div elements and set       ARIA and class values and id    var txtNd = document.createTextNode txt ;    msg = document.createElement "div" ;    msg.setAttribute "role","alert" ;    msg.setAttribute "id","msg" ;    msg.setAttribute "class","alert" ;  300  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA         append text to div, div to document    msg.appendChild txtNd ;    document.body.appendChild msg ; }  Discussion Unless a message is going to be displayed frequently, in my opinion it’s better to create the message and add it to the page only when needed. That way your web page is uncluttered both physically and visually, and isn’t taking up more bandwidth than necessary. Creating a new text message is a simple four-step process:  1. Create the new textNode. 2. Create the parent element. 3. Append the new textNode to the parent element. 4. Append the parent element to the document.  In the solution, the message is going to be incorporated into a newly created div ele- ment. After the div element is created, three attributes are added. The first is the ARIA attribute role, set to alert. This should cause an AT device to interrupt what it’s doing and immediately speak the message. The second attribute is the element id, so the element can be accessed at a later time. The last is a CSS style class name. The class ensures that the message is very easy to spot in the page visually. An example of a CSS setting could be:  You can also use an attribute selector on the role attribute to style the CSS, and forgo the class name:  .alert {      background-color: ffcccc;    pink      font-weight: bold;      padding: 5px;      border: 1px dashed 000; }  [role="alert"] {   background-color: ffeeee;   font-weight: bold;   padding: 5px;   border: 1px dashed 000;   width: 300px;   margin: 20px; }  Now the element’s visual appearance matches the urgency of the ARIA role’s setting.  14.2  Creating an Alert Message  301   To ensure that messages don’t visually pile up in the page before a new alert is created, any previously created alert is removed using the removeChild method on the message element’s parent  in this example, the body element . An alert lets people know that there’s something they need to pay attention to, whether it’s incorrect data or a session that’s about to time out. Providing simple, specific mes- sages to the user is also going to be helpful for those who use visual assistance devices such as screen magnifiers, or have some cognitive difficulties when it comes to web form use. This includes the inexperienced user, as well as those who may be fatigued or have other comprehension problems. Another key aspect to messages such as these is ensuring that they can be easily dis- missed using both keyboard and mouse movements, as we’ll examine in more detail in later recipes. See Also The function to add the text demonstrated in the solution was derived from a tip in Marco’s Accessibility blog. See Recipe 14.4 for a discussion about integrating keyboard access into mouse-based applications.  14.3  Highlighting Form Field with Missing or Incorrect Data Problem You want to highlight missing or incorrectly entered information in a form field. Solution For the fields that need to be validated, assign a function to the form field’s onchange event handler that checks whether the field value is valid. If the value is invalid, pop up an alert with information about the error, and highlight the field using a contrasting color:  document.getElementById "elemid" .onchange=validateField; ... function validateField   {       check for number   if  isNaN parseFloat this.value    {      this.parentNode.setAttribute "style", "background-color: ffcccc" ;      this.setAttribute "aria-invalid", "true" ;      generateAlert "You entered an invalid value in Third Field. Only numeric values such as 105 or 3.54 are allowed" ;   } }  302  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   For the fields that need a required value, assign a function to the field’s onblur event handler that checks whether a value has been entered:  document.getElementById "field" .onblur=checkMandator; ... function checkMandatory   {      check for data   if  this.value.length === 0  {      this.parentNode.setAttribute "style", "background-color: ffcccc" ;      this.setAttribute "aria-invalid", "true" ;      generateAlert "A value is required in this field" ;   } }  If any of the validation checks are performed as part of the form submittal, make sure to cancel the submittal event if the validation fails. Discussion You can’t depend on visual indicators to highlight errors, but they can be a useful extra courtesy. Highlighting an error with color is good, but you should avoid colors that are hard to differentiate from the background. If the form background is white, and you use a dark yellow, gray, red, blue, green, or other color, there’s enough contrast that it doesn’t matter if the person viewing the page is color blind or not. In the example, I used a darker pink around the incorrect field, against a white page. Using a color highlight for form errors is good, but it isn’t enough: you also need to provide a text description of the error, so there’s no question in the user’s mind about what the problem is. How you display the information is also an important consideration. None of us really like to use alert boxes, if we can avoid them. Alert boxes can obscure the form, and the only way to access the form element is to dismiss the alert, with its error message. A better approach is to embed the information in the page, near the form. Fortunately, with the new ARIA roles, we can create an alert message and assign it an ARIA role of alert, alerting those using screen readers or other AT devices. One final touch: to ensure there’s no confusion about which field is invalid, the solution also sets the aria-invalid attribute to true on the field. Not only does this provide useful information for AT device users immediately, it can be used to discover all in- correct fields when the form is submitted. Example 14-1 demonstrates how to highlight an invalid entry on one of the form ele- ments, and highlight missing data in another. The example also traps the form submit, and checks whether there are any invalid form field flags still set. Only if everything is clears is the form submittal allowed to proceed.  14.3  Highlighting Form Field with Missing or Incorrect Data  303   Example 14-1. Providing visual and other cues when validating form fields       Validating Forms    [role="alert"] {   background-color: ffcccc;   font-weight: bold;   padding: 5px;   border: 1px dashed 000; } div {   margin: 10px 0;   padding: 5px;   width: 400px;   background-color: ffffff; }      window.onload=function   {    document.getElementById "thirdfield" .onchange=validateField;   document.getElementById "firstfield" .onblur=mandatoryField;   document.getElementById "testform" .onsubmit=finalCheck; }  function removeAlert   {     var msg = document.getElementById "msg" ;    if  msg  {       document.body.removeChild msg ;    } }  function resetField elem  {    elem.parentNode.setAttribute "style","background-color: ffffff" ;    var valid = elem.getAttribute "aria-invalid" ;    if  valid  elem.removeAttribute "aria-invalid" ; }  function badField elem  {   elem.parentNode.setAttribute "style", "background-color: ffeeee" ;   elem.setAttribute "aria-invalid","true" ; } function generateAlert txt  {        create new text and div elements and set       Aria and class values and id    var txtNd = document.createTextNode txt ;    msg = document.createElement "div" ;    msg.setAttribute "role","alert" ;    msg.setAttribute "id","msg" ;  304  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA      msg.setAttribute "class","alert" ;        append text to div, div to document    msg.appendChild txtNd ;    document.body.appendChild msg ; }  function validateField   {       remove any existing alert regardless of value   removeAlert  ;       check for number   if  !isNaN parseFloat this.value    {      resetField this ;   } else {      badField this ;      generateAlert "You entered an invalid value in Third Field.

In addition, the aria- invalid attribute is set to true in the field, and an ARIA role is set to alert on the error message, as shown in Figure 14-1.  Figure 14-1. Highlighting an incorrect form field  306  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   Notice in the code that the element wrapping the targeted form field is set to its “correct state” when the data entered is correct, so that when a field is corrected it doesn’t show up as inaccurate or missing on the next go-round. Regardless of what event happens, I remove the existing message alert, as it’s no longer valid once the event that triggered it has been handled. When the form is submitted, the application uses a querySelectorAll method call to check for all instances of aria-invalid set to true, and rejects the submission until these are corrected, as shown in Figure 14-2:  var badFields = document.querySelectorAll "[aria-invalid='true']" ;  You can also disable or even hide the correctly entered form elements, as a way to accentuate those with incorrect or missing data. However, I don’t recommend this approach. Your users may find as they fill in the missing information that their answers in other fields were incorrect. If you make it difficult for them to correct the fields, they’re not going to be happy with the experience—or the company, person, or or- ganization providing the form. Another approach you can take is to only do validation when the form is submitted. Most built-in libraries, such as the jQuery Validation plug-in, operate this way. Rather than check each field for mandatory or correct values as your users tab through, you only apply the validation rules when the form is submitted. This way people who want to fill out the form in a different order may do so without getting hit with irritating validation messages as they tab through. This approach is a friendlier technique for those people using a keyboard, rather than a mouse, to fill in the form. Or you can use a mix of both: field-level validation for correct data type and format, form-level vali- dation for required values. Using JavaScript to highlight a form field with incorrect and missing data is only one part of the form submission process. You’ll also have to account for JavaScript being turned off, which means you have to provide the same level of feedback when pro- cessing the form information on the server, and providing the result on a separate page. It’s also important to mark if a form field is required ahead of time. Use an asterisk in the form field label, with a note that all form fields with an asterisk are required. Use the aria-required attribute to ensure this information is communicated to those using assistive devices.

Attempting to submit a form with inaccurate form field entries  14.4  Adding Keyboard Accessibility to a Page Overlay Problem You’ve created a page overlay in order to display a larger image  or text, or other con- tent , and you want it to be keyboard accessible. Solution Add keyboard listening to the page to complement the mouse events:     mouse click on image within link function imgClick   {    var img = this.firstChild;    expandPhoto img.getAttribute "data-larger"  ;    return false; }     key press on image within link function imgKeyPress evnt  {    evnt =  evnt  ? evnt :   window.event  ? window.event : "" ;    var keycode =  evnt.which  ? evnt.which : evnt.keyCode;    if  document.getElementById "overlay"   {  308  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA        if  keycode == 27  {        restore  ;        return false;      }    } else {      if  keycode == 13  {         var img = this.firstChild;         var src = img.getAttribute "data-larger" ;         expandPhoto src ;         return false;      }    } }  Discussion The first step to adding keyboard accessibility into a web page is to either use elements that can receive keyboard focus  a, area, button, input, object, select, and textarea , or use the tabindex="0" setting on the element, which will make the element focusable. The second step is to capture keyboard activity in addition to the mouse events. In Example 14-2, I’ve taken Example 13-3 from Recipe 13.6, and modified what was a mouse-event-only application to also accept keyboard events. The example creates a page overlay and displays a larger image when a person either clicks on a thumbnail image in the original page, or presses the Enter  Return  key when the image has the focus. Clicking the expanded image or pressing the Esc key removes the overlay, and returns the page to its original state.  Example 14-2. Making an overlay photo display page keyboard accessible       Overlay    img {   padding: 5px;   border-style: none; }  .overlay {    background-color: 000;    opacity: .7;    filter: alpha opacity=70 ;    position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;    width: 100%; height: 100%;    z-index: 10; } .overlayimg {    position: absolute;    z-index: 11;  14.4  Adding Keyboard Accessibility to a Page Overlay  309      left: 50px;    top: 50px; }         expand photo when a img is clicked function imgClick   {    var img = this.firstChild;    expandPhoto img.getAttribute "data-larger"  ;    return false; }     if overlay is open, and ESC, close overlay    account for keydown event in page function imgKeyDown evnt  {    evnt =  evnt  ? evnt :   window.event  ? window.event : "" ;    var keycode =  evnt.which  ? evnt.which : evnt.keyCode;    if  document.getElementById "overlay"   {       if  keycode === 27  {        restore  ;        return false;      }    } else {      if  keycode == 13  {         var img = this.firstChild;         var src = img.getAttribute "data-larger" ;         expandPhoto src ;         return false;      }    }    return true; }    create overlay, expand photo function expandPhoto src  {        create overlay element    var overlay = document.createElement "div" ;    overlay.setAttribute "id","overlay" ;    overlay.setAttribute "class", "overlay" ;        IE7       overlay.id="overlay";       overlay.className = "overlay";     document.body.appendChild overlay ;        add image    var img = document.createElement "img" ;    img.src = src;    img.setAttribute "id","img" ;        set tabindex, for focus    img.setAttribute "tabindex","-1" ;  310  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA         style image    img.setAttribute "class","overlayimg" ;        IE7       img.className = "overlayimg";     img.onclick=restore;    img.onkeydown=imgKeyDown;     document.body.appendChild img ;        focus on image in overlay    img.focus  ; }     remove overlay and image function restore   {   document.body.removeChild document.getElementById "overlay"  ;  document.body.removeChild document.getElementById "img"  ; }     add click and keyboard events window.onload=function   {    var aimgs = document.getElementsByTagName "a" ;    aimgs[0].focus  ;    for  var i = 0; i < aimgs.length; i++  {      aimgs[i].onclick=imgClick;    } }          Mouse click on image, or use keyboard to move to photo and hit ENTER to expand the photo. To close expanded photo, hit ESC or mouse click on image.   <img src="dragonfly2.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly2.jpg" alt="image of common dragonfly on bright green and pink flowers"  >   <img src="dragonfly4.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly4.jpg"  alt="Dark orange dragonfly on water lily"  >   <img src="dragonfly6.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly6.jpg" alt="Dark orange dragonfly on purple water lily"  >   <img src="dragonfly8.thumbnail.jpg" data-larger="dragonfly8.jpg" alt="Dragonfly on bright pink water lily"  >     When I opened the new image, I assigned it tabindex of –1, to set keyboard focus. To ensure the application works with scripting disabled, the link references the larger im- age. When scripting is enabled, the image shows in the overlay; with scripting disabled, it opens in a separate page.  14.4  Adding Keyboard Accessibility to a Page Overlay  311   A click  rather than keypress  event is triggered when the Enter key is pressed and the focus  is  on  one  of  the  standard  focusable  elements:  a,  area,  button,  input,  object, select, and textarea. The tabbing did not work with Firefox on the Mac. It does work with Firefox on Win- dows, and hopefully, eventually, will work on the Mac, too. I also tested the application with Opera, Safari, and Chrome, and it worked fine. You do have to use Shift + the arrow keys to move among the images with Opera. Safari overhauled its event system with Safari 3.1, and you no longer get a keypress event when clicking a noncharacter key. When the overlay is open, rather than capture the keypress event, you need to capture the keydown event if you’re using the Esc key to return the page to normal. The application worked out of the box for IE8. To make the page work with IE7, the use of setAttribute and getAttribute with the class attribute should be changed to direct assignment  the downloadable example code contains a workaround . As you can see, using tabbing within a web page is somewhat challenging. However, the future looks bright for this capability, with the new tabindex instructions in HTML5 that clarify tabbing and tabindex behavior. Instead of having to wrap images in links to make them accessible, we can just assign them a tabindex="0". However, for non- focusable elements such as img, you do need to capture keypress and click events. Providing keyboard access is absolutely essential for folks using AT devices, as well as people who have impaired movement. It’s also an important capability for those who are using devices that may have limited mouse capability, such as some phones. And it’s  a  nice  enhancement  for  people  who  just  prefer  to  use  the  keyboard  whenever possible. See Also See Recipe 13.6 for a more in-depth explanation of the mouse events for the application. John Resig has an interesting post on the Safari 3.1 event-handling decision at http:   ejohn.org blog keypress-in-safari-31 .  Recipe  12.15  has  more  information  on  using setAttribute with CSS style properties.  14.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections Problem You want to encapsulate form elements into collapsible sections, and expand when a label is clicked.  312  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   Solution Use an accordion widget in combination with the aria-hidden and aria-expanded states, the tablist, tab, and tabpanel roles, and the aria-labeledby relationship indicator. The entire set of accordion label panel pairs is surrounded by one element, given a role of tablist and an attribute of aria-multiselect set to true to indicate that the element is a container for an accordion or multiselectable tablist. The text for the label is enclosed in a link to make it keyboard-accessible. Since these are groupings of form elements, the label elements pair are surrounded by a fieldset, and the  label is a legend element. If this application were a menu, these elements would most likely be div elements. The processing would, however, remain the same:        <legend class="label" aria-controls="panel1" role="tab" aria-expanded="true" id="label_1" >  Checkboxes    <div  class="elements" id="panel_1" role="tabpanel" aria-labeledby="label_1">    One      Two      Three      Four      Five         <legend class="label" aria-controls="panel2" role="tab" aria-expanded="true" id="label_2" >  Buttons   <div class="elements" id="panel_2" role="tabpanel" aria_labeledby="label_2">    button one      button two      button three      button four      button five           14.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections   313        For each accordion label panel pair, the label is displayed when the page is loaded, while the contents of the accordion panel are hidden. The label is given a role of tab, and the panel given a role of tabpanel. The aria-expanded attribute in the label is also set to false, to indicate to the AT devices that the panel is collapsed, and the aria- hidden is set to true on the panel, to indicate that the contents are not displayed:     process tab panel elements var elements = document.querySelectorAll ".elements" ; for  var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++  {     elements[i].style.display="none";     elements[i].setAttribute "aria-hidden","true" ; }     process tab elements var labels = document.querySelectorAll ".label" ; for  var j = 0; j < labels.length; j++  {     labels[j].onclick=switchDisplay;     labels[j].style.display="block";     labels[j].setAttribute "aria-expanded","false" ; }  When the label is clicked, if the aria-expanded attribute is set to false, the panel is displayed, its aria-hidden attribute is set to false, and the label’s aria-expanded at- tribute is set to true. The opposite occurs if the aria-expanded attribute is set to true:     when tab is clicked or enter key clicked function switchDisplay   {    var parent = this.parentNode;   var targetid = "panel_" + this.id.split "_" [1];   var target = document.getElementById targetid ;    if  this.getAttribute "aria-expanded"  == "true"  {     this.setAttribute "aria-expanded","false" ;     target.style.display="none";     target.setAttribute "aria-hidden","true" ;   } else {     this.setAttribute "aria-expanded","true" ;     target.style.display="block";     target.setAttribute "aria-hidden","false" ;   }   return false; }   Discussion The solution is a modification of the accordion solution in Recipe 13.5. The major structural differences are that one container element is used to wrap all of the accordion label panel pairs, to indicate a grouping, each tab panel pair is surrounded by a field set element, and the div element that acted as a label was replaced by a legend element.  314  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   One aspect of working with ARIA that I wasn’t expecting is that it led me to reexamine how I create my widget-like applications, such as an accordion. In Recipe 13.4, I didn’t group the individual accordion pairs into one cohesive whole because I didn’t need to for the solution I created, and I wanted to keep my element use to a minimum. The ARIA attributes reminded me that there are semantics to the structure of an ac- cordion—semantics I wasn’t capturing. For instance, I was working with a form but wasn’t using form-specific elements. In the new version, instead of using div elements for all aspects of the form element accordion, I used actual form elements: fieldset and legend. Another structural change is that a link is used to wrap the text in the label so that the element can receive keyboard focus. Hitting the Enter key in the label triggers a click event, since a link is a focusable element. Since I’m not capturing the click event in the link, it bubbles up to the parent element—the label. I also added an additional visual element—a background image with an arrow, to in- dicate the direction the panel will open, as shown in Figure 14-3.  Figure 14-3. An accessible accordion  The reason for the addition of the arrows is to ensure clarity of purpose for the grouping of elements. Those users unfamiliar with accordion applications, or who may have cognitive disabilities, can see there is an action associated with the label. I’m not sure about the type of arrow I used—a better approach might be a simple triangle. The other change to the example was the addition of ARIA roles and states. At first, the accessibility additions may seem to be rather numerous, but each provides a specific piece of information necessary to understand what’s happening with the accordion  14.5  Creating Collapsible Form Sections   315   widget. Consider how you would describe an accordion if you were describing it over the phone to a friend: “The accordion is a group of label elements, each of which has text. Each label also has an arrow, and I know from prior experience with similarly structured web page objects that clicking each label opens a panel underneath. When I  do  click  each  label,  a  section  of  previously  hidden  web  page  is  displayed  directly beneath the label, and I’m able to see its contents. When I click other labels, their associated panels also display. However, when I click the label for an already open label, the panel it is associated with is removed from view.” In ARIA, these visual impressions are conveyed by the use of the tablist role on the outer  container,  and  the  role  of  tab  on  the  label.  In  addition,  the  use  of  aria- multiselect also indicates that more than one panel can be expanded at the same time. The fact that the panels are collapsed is indicated by the aria-expanded attribute, and that the panels aren’t displayed is indicated by the aria-hidden on each. When you open the application with a screen reader, such as NVDA in Firefox, and close your eyes, what I described is more or less what the device states. The application works with all the book’s target browsers. However, the use of query SelectorAll doesn’t work with IE7. An alternative would be to access elements by tag name, and then check each element’s class to see how to handle it. You’ll also want to avoid using CSS attribute selector syntax with IE7. See Also See Recipe 13.4 for another implementation of the accordion. For an excellent dem- onstration of the use of the ARIA attributes with an accordion, see the accordion ex- ample at the Illinois Center for Information Technology and Web Accessibility.  14.6  Displaying a Flash of Color to Signal an Action Problem Based on some action, you want to display a visual cue to signify the success of the action. Solution Use a flash to signal the success or failure of an action. The use of a red flash is standard to signal either a successful deletion, or an error; the use of a yellow flash is typically used to signal a successful update, or action:  var fadingObject = {    yellowColor : function  val  {    var r="ff";   var g="ff";    var b=val.toString 16 ;    var newval = ""+r+g+b;    return newval;  316  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   },    fade : function  id,start,finish  {    this.count = this.start = start;    this.finish = finish;    this.id = id;    this.countDown = function   {       this.count+=30;       if  this.count >= this.finish  {          document.getElementById this.id .style.background=                                                     "transparent";          this.countDown=null;          return;       }       document.getElementById this.id .style.backgroundColor=          this.yellowColor this.count ;       setTimeout this.countDown.bind this ,100 ;    }   } }; ...    fade page element identified as "one" fadingObject.fade "one", 0, 300 ; fadingObject.countDown  ;  Discussion A flash, or fade as it is frequently called, is a quick flash of color. It’s created using a recurring timer, which changes the background color of the object being flashed. The color is varied by successively changing the values of the nondominant RGB colors, or colors from a variation of 0 to 255, while holding the dominant color or colors at FF. Figure 14-4 shows how this color variation works with the color green. If for some reason the green color can’t be perceived  such as this figure being in a paper copy of this book, or because of color blindness , the color shows as successions of gray. As you progress down the figure, the color gets progressively paler, as the nondominant red and blue values are increased, from initial hexadecimal values of 00, to FF 255 . The color yellow used in the solution kept the red and green values static, while chang- ing the blue. A red flash would keep the red color static, while adjusting both the green and blue. In the solution, I’m setting the beginning and ending colors for the flash when I call the fade method on the object, fadingObject. Thus, if I don’t want to start at pure yellow or end at white, I can begin with a paler color, or end with a paler color. A color flash is used to highlight an action. When used with Ajax, a red flash can single the deletion of a table row just before the row is removed from the table. The flash is an additional visual cue, as the table row being deleted helps set the context for the flash. A yellow flash can do the same when a table row is updated.  14.6  Displaying a Flash of Color to Signal an Action  317   Figure 14-4. Demonstrating how a color flash effect changes  A flash can also be used with an alert message. In Recipe 14.2, I created an alert that displayed a solid color until removed from the page. I could also have used a red flash to highlight the message, and left the background a pale pink at the end:  function generateAlert txt  {        create new text and div elements and set       Aria and class values and id    var txtNd = document.createTextNode txt ;    msg = document.createElement "div" ;    msg.setAttribute "role","alert" ;    msg.setAttribute "id","msg" ;    obj.fade "msg", 0, 127 ;    obj.redFlash  ;    msg.setAttribute "class","alert" ;  318  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA         append text to div, div to document    msg.appendChild txtNd ;    document.body.appendChild msg ; }  The only requirement for the solution would be to either make the color-fade effect more generic, for any color, or add a new, specialized redFlash method that does the same as the yellow. Previously, if the color flash hasn’t been considered an accessibility aid, it’s also not considered an accessibility hindrance, either. As I mentioned earlier, it should be paired with some other event or response that provides information about what’s happening. In the code snippet, when the alert message is displayed, it’s done with a flash, but the ARIA alert role is also assigned so that those using a screen reader get notified. How about other accessibility concerns, though, such as photosensitive epilepsy? Or those with cognitive impairments where page movement or light flickering can disrupt the ability to absorb the page content? A simple color flash as demonstrated should not result in any negative reaction. It’s a single progressive movement, rather than a recurring flicker, and over quickly. In fact, the WebAIM website—which is focused on accessibility—makes use of a yellow flash in an exceedingly clever and accessible way. If you access one of the WebAIM articles, such as the one on keyboard accessibility, and click one of the links that takes you to an in-page anchor, the page  once it has scrolled to the anchor location  gives material associated with the anchor a subtle and quick yellow flash to highlight its location. In the site’s JavaScript, the author of the JavaScript writes:     This technique is a combination of a technique I used for    highlighting FAQ's using anchors    and the ever popular yellow-fade technique used by    37 Signals in Basecamp.     Including this script in a page will automatically do two    things when the page loads...    1. Highlight a target item from the URL  browser address bar     if one is present.    2. Set up all anchor tags with targets pointing to the current    page to cause a fade on the target element when clicked.  In other words, when the page is loaded, the author accesses all anchors in the page:  var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName "a" ;  The  author  then  traverses  this  array,  checking  to  see  if  the  anchor  has  a  fragment identifier   :  if  anchors[i].href.indexOf '' >-1   14.6  Displaying a Flash of Color to Signal an Action  319   If so, then clicking that link also causes the section to highlight:  anchors[i].onclick = function  {Highlight this.href ;return true};  I haven’t seen a flash used for this effect before, and it demonstrates how accessible a flash can be when used for good effect. If you’ve ever clicked an in-page link that goes to a page fragment located toward the bottom of the page, you know how frustrating it can be to find exactly which section is referenced by the link when there is not enough page left to scroll the item to the top. Now, with the use of page-fragment link highlighting, you can immediately locate the linked section. And since the highlight fades, once the section is located, you don’t have to put up with the colored background, which can impact on the amount of contrast between color of text and color of background.

You also want the application to be accessible. Solution Use a tabbed page application and include the ARIA roles tablist, tabpanel, and tab, as well as the aria-hidden state. The tabbed page is a div element, as is the container, with the tabs as list items  li  within  a  single  unordered  list   ul   at  the  top.  The  container  div  is  given  a  role  of tablist, and each of the li elements given a role of tab. The tabbed panels are div elements containing whatever type of contents, and each is given a role of tabpanel. The relationship between panel and tab is made with the aria-labeledby attribute:                            Page One              Page Two              Page Three                            <div class="tabpage" role="tabpanel" aria-labeledby="tabnav_1" aria-hidden="false" id="tabpage_1">  320  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA             page 1                <div class="tabpage" role="tabpanel" aria-labeledby="tabnav_2" aria-hidden="true" id="tabpage_2">           page 2                <div class="tabpage" role="tabpanel" aria-labeledby="tabnav_3" aria-hidden="true" id="tabpage_3">           page 3                  When the page loads, the tabs are displayed and all but the first of the panels are hidden. The hidden panels are assigned an aria-hidden attribute value of true. The click event handler for all of the tab elements is assigned a function, displayPage, to control the tab page display. A custom data attribute, data-current, on the tabbed page container is used to store which tab is currently selected:     set up display    for each container display navigation    hide all but first page, highlight first tab window.onload=function   {       for each container   var containers = document.querySelectorAll ".tabcontainer" ;   for  var j = 0; j < containers.length; j++  {         display and hide elements     var nav = containers[j].querySelector ".tabnavigation ul" ;     nav.style.display="block";         set current tab    var navitem = containers[j].querySelector ".tabnavigation ul li" ;     var ident = navitem.id.split "_" [1];     navitem.parentNode.setAttribute "data-current",ident ;     navitem.setAttribute "style","background-color: ccf" ;         set displayed tab panel     var pages = containers[j].querySelectorAll ".tabpage" ;     for  var i = 1; i < pages.length; i++  {       pages[i].style.display="none";       pages[i].setAttribute "aria-hidden","true" ;     }         for each tab, attach event handler function    var tabs = containers[j].querySelectorAll ".tabnavigation ul li" ;     for  var i = 0; i < tabs.length; i++  {       tabs[i].onclick=displayPage;     }   } }  When a tab is clicked, the old tabbed entry is cleared by setting the background of the tab to white and hiding the panel. The new entry’s tab is highlighted  background color  14.7  Adding ARIA Attributes to a Tabbed Page Application  321   is changed , and its associated panel is displayed. The hidden panel’s aria-hidden at- tribute is set to true, while the displayed panel’s aria-hidden attribute is set to false. The custom data attribute data-current is set to the new tab selection, and the clicked tab’s id is used to derive the related panel’s ID:     click on tab function displayPage   {       hide old selection   var current = this.parentNode.getAttribute "data-current" ;   var oldpanel = document.getElementById "tabpage_" + current ;    document.getElementById "tabnav_" + current .setAttribute "style",   "background-color: fff" ;   oldpanel.style.display="none";   oldpanel.setAttribute "aria-hidden","true" ;       display new selection   var ident = this.id.split "_" [1];   this.setAttribute "style","background-color: ccf" ;   var newpanel = document.getElementById "tabpage_" + ident ;    newpanel.style.display="block";   newpanel.setAttribute "aria-hidden","false" ;   this.parentNode.setAttribute "data-current",ident ;    return false; }  Discussion The code in the solution is very similar to that in Recipe 13.7; the only difference is the addition of the ARIA roles and attributes. The changes are minor—I highlighted the lines in the JavaScript that were added to enable ARIA support. As you can see, adding accessibility with ARIA is not an onerous task. Another excellent demonstration of an ARIA-enabled tabbed page can be found at the Illinois Center for Information Technology and Web Accessibility. Though the code to manage the tabbed page behavior differs significantly from mine, the relative struc- ture and use of ARIA roles and attributes is identical. The main difference between the two implementations is that my example uses a link to make my tabs clickable, while the external example uses tabindex. The external application also makes more extensive use of the keyboard. As mentioned in Recipe 14.5, working with the ARIA attributes provides a new way of looking at widget-like applications like tabbed pages and accordions. The Illinois Cen- ter I just mentioned actually lists both the accordion and tabbed page example in one section specific to tabbed pages, because they have very similar behavior. The only difference is one is multiselectable, the other not; one requires modification to the label to signify which label is associated with which panel, while the other does not need this information. By looking at both types of widgets with a fresh viewpoint, I’ve learned  322  Chapter 14: Creating Interactive and Accessible Effects with JavaScript, CSS, and ARIA   new ways to use both: instead of creating vertical accordion panels, I’ve also started using horizontal panels; rather than tabs being located at the top of a tabbed applica- tion, I’ve started placing them on the side. It taught me to appreciate how they are both semantically linked, and how to ensure this semantic similarity is preserved in both structure and code. See Also Recipe 14.4 covers some of the implementation details with using tabindex.  14.8  Live Region Problem You have a section of a web page that is updated periodically, such as a page section that lists recent updates to a file, or one that reflects recent Twitter activity on a subject. You want to ensure that when the page updates, those using a screen reader are updated with the new information. Solution Use ARIA region attributes on the element being updated:  <ul id="update" role="log" aria-alive="polite" aria-atomic="true" aria-relevant="additions">    Discussion A section of the web page that can be updated after the page is loaded, and without direct user intervention, calls for the use of ARIA Live Regions. These are probably the simplest ARIA functionality to implement, and they provide immediate, positive re- sults. And there’s no code involved, other than the JavaScript you need to create the page updates. I took the example application from Recipe 18.9, which updates the web page based on the contents of a text file on the server that the application retrieves using Ajax, and provided two minor updates. First, I modified the code that polls for the updates to check how many items have been added to the unordered list after the update. If the number is over 10, the oldest is removed from the page:     process return function processResponse   {    if xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200  {      var li = document.createElement "li" ;      var txt = document.createTextNode xmlhttp.responseText ;      li.appendChild txt ;  14.8  Live Region  323        var ul = document.getElementById "update" ;      ul.appendChild li ;          prune top of list      if  ul.childNodes.length > 10  {        ul.removeChild ul.firstChild ;      }     } else if  xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status != 200  {      alert xmlhttp.responseText ;    } }  With this change, the list doesn’t grow overly long. I made one more change, adding the ARIA roles and states to the unordered list that serves as the updatable live region:  <ul id="update" role="log" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true" aria-relevant="additions s">  From left to right: the role is set to log, because I’m polling for log updates from a file, and only displaying the last 10 or so items. Other options include status, for a status update, and a more general region value, for an undetermined purpose. The aria-live region attribute is set to polite, because the update isn’t a critical update. The polite setting tells the screen reader to voice the update, but not interrupt a current task to do so. If I had used a value of assertive, the screen reader would interrupt whatever it is doing and voice the content. Always use polite, unless the information is critical. The aria-atomic is set to true, so that the screen reader only voices new additions. It could get very annoying to have the screen reader voice the entire set with each new addition, as would happen if this value is set to false. Lastly, the aria-relevant is set to additions, as we don’t care about the entries being removed from the top. This is actually the default setting for this attribute, so in this case it wasn’t needed. In addition, AT devices don’t have to support this attribute. Still, I’d rather list it than not. Other values are removals, text, and all  for all events . You can specify more than one, separated by a space. This ARIA-enabled functionality was probably the one that impressed me the most. One of my first uses for Ajax, years ago, was to update a web page with information. It was frustrating to test the page with a screen reader  JAWS, at the time  and hear nothing but silence every time the page was updated. I can’t even imagine how frus- trating it was for those who needed the functionality. Now we have it, and it’s so easy to use. It’s a win-win.

Cool videos. Sound! The  Web  of  the  future  will  be  a  richer  place,  indeed,  with  the  new  and  improved innovations ready to use. Our old friends SVG and Canvas are getting new life and generating new interest. Added to them are the new video and audio elements included in HTML5, and the near-future potential of 3D graphics. JavaScript and CSS provide a malleable palette in which to paint web pages, but SVG and the canvas element provide the capability to take those pages into new and exciting territory. SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is an XML-based vector graphics language that can be used to create scalable vector graphics within web pages. You can insert the SVG into object elements, or in certain circumstances embed the SVG directly in the web page. New advances also allow you to include SVG using the img element, and CSS. SVG is normally a static XML markup, and not dependent on JavaScript. However, as will be demonstrated later in the chapter, SVG and JavaScript can be used to create any number of dynamic graphics. The canvas element originated with Apple, and is now becoming standardized as part of the HTML5 Web Applications 1.0 effort. Unlike SVG, the canvas element is totally dependent on JavaScript. We add canvas elements into our page and then use a 2D context API in order to draw into these elements. SVG and Canvas are implemented in varying degrees in all of this book’s target brows- ers, except for Internet Explorer  though recently we learned that IE9 will support SVG, at least . However, recipes in this chapter provide how-tos for enabling support for both, in all browsers and in most environments.  325   Newcomers joining the media environment are the audio and video elements included in  HTML5,  and  already  implemented,  albeit  with  some  differences,  in  our  target browsers. Where before we depended on Flash to play video, now we can embed videos natively and manipulate the videos using JavaScript. The last newcomer introduced in this chapter isn’t really a newcomer, but an old friend with a new face: WebGL  Web Graphics Library , and via plug-ins, the newer X3D. Years ago, I used to work with VRML  Virtual Reality Modeling Language , which was the earliest version of 3D on the Web. These 3D technologies pick up where VRML left off, providing a new three-dimensional world to explore. Since this is only one chapter, and I’m not the most artistic person in the world, I’m focusing primarily on introducing all of these wonderful new tools and providing some basic how-tos, such as how can you get SVG to work in IE. Once you have a good idea of how these media technologies work, you can explore the Web and examine the already rich set of demos and uses in order to find inspiration for your own adventures.

Solution Insert a canvas element into the web page:     Two overlapping squares     Then use the Canvas 2D API to create the shapes. The following creates three over- lapping rectangles:  var imgcanvas = document.getElementById "imgcanvas" ; if  imgcanvas.getContext  {    var ctx = imgcanvas.getContext '2d' ;    ctx.fillStyle="rgba 255,0,0,.1 ";    ctx.strokeStyle="000000";        rect one    ctx.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;  326  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications      ctx.strokeRect 0,0,100,100 ;        rect two    ctx.fillRect 50,50,100,200 ;        rect three    ctx.strokeRect 80,130,200,100 ;   }  Discussion The canvas element is inserted into the web page in the location you want the canvas drawing to exist. You can provide a styling for the element, but it’s not going to impact on the actual canvas drawing, which is managed via the Canvas 2D API. You can set the width and height of the canvas element using the width and height attributes. You can also, as shown in the solution, provide fallback content—in this case, a paragraph describing what’s being drawn within the canvas element. In JavaScript, you have to get the canvas element’s context first. Though most imple- mentations of the canvas element only support a 2D context, you’ll still need to specify 2d when accessing the context. When support for 3D is added, you’d pass in a value of 3d. Before you begin drawing, test to see if the canvas element is supported:  if  imgcanvas.getContent  {    var ctx = imgcanvas.getContext '2d' ; ... }  Once you have the canvas context, all the API calls from that point go to that specific canvas element. The solution demonstrates creating three rectangles, as shown in Fig- ure 15-1. There are three different rectangle methods:  fillRect  strokeRect  clearRect  Uses the currently set fillStyle value to fill the rectangle  Uses the currently set strokeStyle value to outline the rectangle  Clears whatever is drawn within the rectangle area  The last method, clearRect, wasn’t demonstrated in the solution; it actually removes the pixels within the rectangle area. Since the canvas element is transparent by default, this would expose the document content underneath the canvas element. All three methods take an origin, a width, and a height, in the following order: x, y, width, height. The origin increases from top to bottom, and from left to right, so an x,y value of 0,0 would place the upper-left corner of the rectangle at the upper-left corner of the canvas.  15.1  Creating Basic Shapes in Canvas  Using the canvas Element    327   Figure 15-1. Three rectangles drawn in the canvas area  The canvas element is supported in all major browsers except Internet Explorer. Rec- ipe 15.2 provides a solution that allows the canvas element to work with IE. See Also It’s important to provide fallback content not only for accessibility purposes, but in those cases where JavaScript is not enabled. Current work is underway with the W3C to provide more in-depth accessibility infor- mation with the canvas element. Until implemented, though, you shouldn’t use the canvas element for important information  unless you provide a fallback , or for site navigation or other critical site use.  15.2  Implementing Canvas Applications in IE Problem You want to ensure your Canvas application works in IE.  328  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   Solution Use a Canvas emulation library, such as explorercanvas, created by Erik Arvidsson:        Discussion The explorercanvas library works by emulating the canvas element using Microsoft’s Virtual Markup Language  VML —the company’s own version of a vector graphics language. Example 15-1 is a web page that contains a link to the explorercanvas library, and the canvas example from Recipe 15.1. The example creates three rectangles in a canvas element. The difference between the two applications is that this version works with IE.  Example 15-1. Cross-browser application creating three rectangles in a canvas element       Canvas Squares              <![CDATA[  window.onload=function   {   var imgcanvas = document.getElementById "imgcanvas" ;  if  imgcanvas.getContext  {    var ctx = imgcanvas.getContext '2d' ;    ctx.fillStyle="rgba 255,0,0,.1 ";    ctx.strokeStyle="000000";        rect one    ctx.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;    ctx.strokeRect 0,0,100,100 ;        rect two    ctx.fillRect 50,50,100,200 ;        rect three    ctx.strokeRect 80,130,200,100 ;   } }    ]]>          Three rectangles, overlapping   15.2  Implementing Canvas Applications in IE  329        There is an additional constraint to using explorercanvas: if you create the canvas ele- ment dynamically using the document.createElement method, you need to include the following code so that the library can map the getContext method to the new canvas element:  var newcanvas = document.createElement "canvas" ; G_vmlCanvasManager.initElement newcanvas ; var ctx = newcanvas.getContext '2d' ;  Download explorercanvas from http:  code.google.com p explorercanvas .  15.3  Creating a Dynamic Line Chart in Canvas Problem You want to display a line chart in your web page, but the data changes over time, and you want to dynamically update it. Solution Use the canvas element and the path method to create the chart. When the data changes, update the chart:   var array1 = [[100,100], [150, 50], [200,185],                [250, 185], [300,250], [350,100], [400,250],                [450, 100], [500,20], [550,80], [600, 120]];   var imgcanvas = document.getElementById "imgcanvas" ;   if  imgcanvas.getContext  {    var ctx = imgcanvas.getContext '2d' ;        rect one    ctx.strokeRect 0,0,600,300 ;        line path    ctx.beginPath  ;    ctx.moveTo 0,100 ;    for  var i = 0; i < array1.length; i++  {      ctx.lineTo array1[i][0], array1[i][1] ;    }    ctx.stroke  ; }  Discussion Canvas paths are the way to create arbitrary shapes in Canvas. After getting the canvas context, ctx, the path is begun with a call to ctx.beginPath  . This marks the beginning  330  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   of the path, and calling the method again starts a new path. The next line of code is ctx.moveTo, which moves the drawing “pen” to a beginning location without drawing. From that point, several calls are made to lineTo, using an array of paired values rep- resenting the x,y location for each line endpoint. After all of the line points have been defined, the path is drawn. We’re not creating a closed path, so I’m not using ctx.closePath  , which would attempt to draw a line from the ending point to the beginning point. Instead, I’m drawing the line given the points that have been defined, using ctx.stroke  . This creates a single path. To dynamically update the chart, you can incorporate timers, and either replace the path  by creating an entirely new context, which would erase the old , or add the new line chart to the same chart. Example 15-2 shows a web page that creates the line in the solution and then creates two others, each drawn after a short period of time using timers. The colors for the stroke path are changed between lines.  Example 15-2. Using timers to dynamically update a line chart       Canvas Chart             window.onload=function   {   var array1 = [[100,100], [150, 50], [200,185],                [250, 185], [300,250], [350,100], [400,250],                [450, 100], [500,20], [550,80], [600, 120]];   var array2 = [[100,100], [150, 150], [200,135],                [250, 285], [300,150], [350,150], [400,280],                [450, 100], [500,120], [550,80], [600, 190]];   var array3 = [[100,200], [150, 100], [200,35],                [250, 185], [300,10], [350,15], [400,80],                [450, 100], [500,120], [550,80], [600, 120]];   var imgcanvas = document.getElementById "imgcanvas" ;   if  imgcanvas.getContext  {    var ctx = imgcanvas.getContext '2d' ;        rectangle wrapping line chart    ctx.strokeRect 0,0,600,300 ;        first line    ctx.beginPath  ;    ctx.moveTo 0,100 ;    for  var i = 0; i < array1.length; i++  {  15.3  Creating a Dynamic Line Chart in Canvas   331        ctx.lineTo array1[i][0], array1[i][1] ;    }    ctx.stroke  ;     setTimeout function   {         ctx.strokeStyle="ff0000";            second line        ctx.beginPath  ;        ctx.moveTo 0,100 ;        for  var i = 0; i < array2.length; i++  {          ctx.lineTo array2[i][0], array2[i][1] ;        }         ctx.stroke  ;            second time out        setTimeout function   {           ctx.strokeStyle="00ff00";           ctx.fillStyle="rgba 255,255,0,.1 ";               third line           ctx.beginPath  ;           ctx.moveTo 0,100 ;           for  var i = 0; i < array3.length; i++  {              ctx.lineTo array3[i][0],array3[i][1] ;           }            ctx.stroke  ;        }, 5000 ;    }, 5000 ;   } }           Include an image that has a static representation of the chart       Figure 15-2 shows the line chart after all three lines have been drawn. Notice that the web page makes use of the explorercanvas library, excanvas.js, to ensure the chart also draws in Internet Explorer. There are other path methods: arc, to draw curves, and quadraticCurveTo and bezier CurveTo, to draw quadratic and bezier curves. All of these methods can be combined in one path to create complex images.  332  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   Figure 15-2.

A good Canvas tutorial can be found at Mozilla.  15.4  Adding JavaScript to an SVG File Problem You want to add JavaScript to an SVG file or element. Solution JavaScript in SVG is included in script elements, just as with XHTML. The DOM methods are also available for working with the SVG elements. One restriction for SVG that you don’t have with HTML is that SVG is XML, so script blocks in an SVG file or element must have CDATA sections surrounding the actual script, as shown in the SVG file in Example 15-3.  15.4  Adding JavaScript to an SVG File  333   Example 15-3. Demonstration of JavaScript within an SVG file    <svg xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg" xmlns:xlink="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink" width="600" height="600">         <![CDATA[           set element onclick event handler       window.onload=function    {           var square = document.getElementById "square" ;              onclick event handler, change circle radius          square.onclick = function   {             var color = this.getAttribute "fill" ;             if  color == "ff0000"  {                this.setAttribute "fill", "0000ff" ;             } else {                this.setAttribute "fill","ff0000" ;             }          }       }     ]]>       <rect id="square" width="400" height="400" fill="ff0000"    x="10" y="10"  >   Discussion As the solution demonstrates, SVG is XML, and the rules for embedding script into XML must be adhered to. This means providing the script type within the script tag, as well as wrapping the script contents in a CDATA block. The DOM methods document.getElementById, getAttribute, and setAttribute are the methods we’ve come to know so well in the rest of the book. The DOM methods aren’t just HTML-specific; they’re usable with any XML document, including SVG. What’s new is the SVG-specific fill attribute, which is one of the color attributes that are standard for the SVG shape elements such as rect. The solution is a standalone SVG file, with a .svg extension. But if we were to embed the SVG within an XHTML file served as application xhtml+xml, such as that shown in Example 15-4, the color-changing animation would work the same.  Example 15-4. SVG element from Example 15-1, embedded into an XHTML page  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC     "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1  EN"     "http:  www.w3.org 2002 04 xhtml-math-svg xhtml-math-svg.dtd"> <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml"       xmlns:svg="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg"       xmlns:xlink="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink" xml:lang="en">    334  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications    Accessing Inline SVG  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="application xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8"  >               <![CDATA[           set element onclick event handler       window.onload=function    {           var square = document.getElementById "square" ;              onclick event handler, change circle radius          square.onclick = function   {             var color = this.getAttribute "fill" ;             if  color == "ff0000"  {                this.setAttribute "fill","0000ff" ;             } else {                this.setAttribute "fill","ff0000" ;             }          }       }     ]]>       <svg:rect id="square" width="400" height="400" fill="ff0000"  x="10" y="10"  >        Chrome, Safari, Opera, and Firefox all support SVG. IE8 doesn’t, but IE9 will. Rec- ipe 15.6 covers how you can enable SVG graphics in IE8.  15.5  Accessing SVG from Web Page Script Problem You want to modify the contents of an SVG element from script within the web page. Solution If the SVG is embedded directly in the web page, access the element and its attributes using the same functionality you would use with any other web page element:  var square = document.getElementById "ssquare" ; square.setAttributeNS null, "width", "500" ;  However, if the SVG is in an external SVG file embedded into the page via an object element, you have to get the document for the external SVG file in order to access the  15.5  Accessing SVG from Web Page Script   335   SVG elements. The technique requires object detection because the process differs by browser:     set element onclick event handler window.onload=function    {     var object = document.getElementById "object" ;    var svgdoc;     try {        svgdoc = object.contentDocument;    } catch e  {       try {           svgdoc = object.getSVGDocument  ;         } catch  e  {           alert "SVG in object not supported in your environment" ;        }    }     if  !svgdoc  return;     var square = svgdoc.getElementById 'square' ;    square.setAttributeNS null, "width", "500" ;  Discussion The first option listed in the solution accesses SVG embedded in an XHTML file. You can access SVG elements using the same methods you’ve used to access HTML ele- ments. Because SVG in XHTML does incorporate support for namespaces, I use the namespace version of the DOM methods, even when no namespace is used  it’s set to null . The second option is a little more involved, and depends on retrieving the document object for the SVG document. The first approach tries to access the contentDocument property  on  the  object.  If  this  fails,  the  application  then  tries  to  access  the  SVG document using the getSVGDocument object method. Once you have access to the SVG document object, you can use the same DOM methods you would use with elements native to the web page. The code works with all the browsers supported in this book except IE, which I’ll cover in a later recipe. Example 15-4 in Recipe 15.4, showed one way to embed SVG into the web page. This approach  currently  only  works  with  XHTML  pages,  served  as  application xml +xhtml. HTML5 adds native support to SVG in HTML, so in the future you’ll also be able to embed SVG directly into HTML files, though currently only Firefox 3.6 supports this, and only with HTML5 enabled.  336  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   You can enable HTML5 support in Firefox 3.6  and up, until it’s the default  by typing about:config into the address bar, and setting the html5.enable preference to true. Note, though, that this is very cutting- edge and unstable.  Example 15-5 shows a second way to add SVG to a web page, and how to access the SVG element s  from script in HTML.  Example 15-5. Accessing SVG in an object element from script       SVG in Object        <object id="object" data="rect.svg" style="padding: 20px; width: 600px; height: 600px">  No SVG support         var object = document.getElementById "object" ;   object.onload=function   {       var svgdoc;           get access to the SVG document object       try {           svgdoc = object.contentDocument;       } catch e  {          try {              svgdoc = object.getSVGDocument  ;            } catch  e  {             alert "SVG in object not supported in your environment" ;           }       }        if  !svgdoc  return;       var r = svgdoc.rootElement;           get SVG element and modify       var square = svgdoc.getElementById 'square' ;       square.onclick = function   {             SVG supports namespaces          var width = parseFloat square.getAttributeNS null,"width"  ;          width-=50;          square.setAttributeNS null,"width",width ;          var color = square.getAttributeNS null,"fill" ;          if  color == "blue"  {  15.5  Accessing SVG from Web Page Script   337                square.setAttributeNS null,"fill","yellow" ;              square.setAttributeNS null,"stroke","green" ;          } else {              square.setAttributeNS null,"fill","blue" ;              square.setAttributeNS null,"stroke","red" ;          }       }   }       In addition to the different approaches to get the SVG document, you also have to handle browser differences in how the onload event handler works. Firefox and Opera fire the onload event handler for the window after all the document contents have loa- ded, including the SVG in the object element. However, Safari and Chrome, probably because of the shared WebKit core, fire the window.onload event handler before the SVG has finished loading. In  the  example  code,  the  object  is  accessed  in  script  after  it  has  loaded,  and  the object.onload event handler is then accessed to get the SVG document and assigned the function to the onclick event handler.  15.6  Emulating SVG in Internet Explorer Problem You want the SVG in your object element, or embedded in the page, to be visible to Internet Explorer users. Solution Use a library, such as SVGWeb, to facilitate the display of SVG. If the SVG is incorporated into the page via an object element, use the following syntax:    <object src="graphic.svg" classid="image svg+xml" width="200" height="200" id="svgObject">    --> <object data="graphic.svg" type="image svg+xml width="200" height="200" id="svgObject">      338  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   The conditional comments are necessary in order for SVGWeb to do its magic correctly. Embedded SVG is much simpler. Just add the SVGWeb library, and enclose the SVG within a script element:               ...        Discussion Currently, there is no support for SVG in Internet Explorer. Microsoft has committed to supporting SVG and XHTML in IE9, due out sometime in 2011. Until then, we can use a library such as SVGWeb. SVGWeb works by emulating the SVG in Flash. Since Flash is more or less ubiquitous on most people’s sites, most folks won’t have to install any additional plug-in. To incorporate SVGWeb into your web pages and applications, once you’ve down- loaded the source and unzipped it, load the src directory to your web, and include a link to the SVGWeb JavaScript in your web pages:      This tag assumes that the SVGWeb code is still in the src directory, and that the libraries are not in the same directory as your web pages. If the libraries are in a different location, you need to provide the data-path custom data attribute and point to the relative lo- cation of the libraries.  Download  SVGWeb  and  view  manuals  and  other  help  at  http:  code .google.com p svgweb . Ample SDK is another excellent library that pro- vides SVG support for IE, originally created by Sergey Ilinsky.  See Also Recipe 15.7 discusses how SVGWeb works across browsers and in HTML.  15.7  Enable Interactive SVG Embedded in HTML Problem You want to embed SVG directly into an HTML page without having to use XHTML.  15.7  Enable Interactive SVG Embedded in HTML  339   Solution You have two options: you can use HTML5 to create the web page and wait until SVG in HTML is supported in all of your targeted browsers. Or you can use a JavaScript library, such as SVGWeb, to wrap your SVG:               ...        Discussion Previously, to embed SVG directly into a web page, you had to use XHTML rather than HTML. With HTML5, SVG is now supported in HTML, but the support for this change is still limited. I introduced SVGWeb in Recipe 15.6 to enable SVG support in Internet Explorer. The library  also  provides  support  for  embedding  SVG  directly  into  HTML  pages.  Until there’s more widespread support for SVG in HTML5 documents  currently only sup- ported by Firefox 3.6 and up , you should use a library such as SVGWeb. If you are embedding SVG directly in HTML5, there is one major difference you need to be aware of: there is no namespace support in HTML5. The SVG namespace is bound to the svg element, as the MathML namespace is bound to the math element, but support for these and other SVG and MathML elements is hardcoded into the HTML5 speci- fication rather than gracefully integrated because of namespace support. This can affect your JavaScript application. If the SVG you embed in the page contains other namespaced elements, you can’t use namespace functions in order to access the elements. Example 15-6 more fully demonstrates these concerns.  Example 15-6. SVG embedded in HTML5 served as text html       SVG                 set element onclick event handler       window.onload=function    {          var circle = document.getElementById 'redcircle' ;              onclick event handler, change circle radius          circle.onclick = function   {             var r = parseInt this.getAttributeNS null,"r"  ;             r-=10;             circle.setAttributeNS "","r",r ;             var  dc =  340  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications     document.getElementsByTagNameNS "http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ",                  "title" ;             for  var i = 0; i < dc.length; i++  {                var str = dc.item i .namespaceURI + " " +                dc.item i .prefix + " " + dc.item i .localName + " " +                               dc.item i .textContent;                alert str ;             }         }       }        SVG   This is  text html !

Clicking the red circle changes the circle dimensions, using the namespace versions  of  document.getElementsByTagName,  passing  in  null  as  the  namespace.  The script also accesses all Dublin Core namespaced  dc  titles in the SVG, and displays them in alerts. When the circle is clicked, it resizes, but nothing is printed out. How can this be? The JavaScript doesn’t have any errors, and there’s obviously Dublin Core namespaced titles in the page. The big disconnect is the page is served as HTML, and the namespaces only work correctly in an XML-based format, like XHTML. If I were to make one seemingly small change in the code, from:  var  dc = document.getElementsByTagNameNS "http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ", "title" ;  to:  var  dc = document.getElementsByTagName "dc:title" ;  I would get a reference to all four  dc:title elements in the SVG metadata section. However, there are still problems. If I were to convert the example into XHTML by adding an html element with the default namespace before the head element:     Then add an ending HTML tag, and wrap the scripting block in a CDATA section:      <![CDATA[ ...   ]]>    And  then  run  the  application,  I  would  get  the  dc:title  values  using  the  original document.getElementsByTagNS, but the alert message is different than for the HTML result. Here’s an example, from the XHTML application:  http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 dc title Sizing Red Circle  342  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   The equivalent from the HTML application is:  http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg null dc:title Sizing Red Circle  Returning to the code, these values are printed out via the following two lines of code:  var str = dc.item i .namespaceURI + " " +  dc.item i .prefix + " " + dc.item i .localName + " " + dc.item i .textContent; alert str ;  Where the two environments differ, drastically, is that all of the elements within the SVG  element  are  included  within  the  SVG  namespace  when  the  page  is  loaded  as HTML. In the XHTML version, they’re included in the proper namespace. So, the very first property printed, the element’s namespaceURI, contains different values because of the different namespace support. The next property, the item’s prefix, is null in the HTML version. That’s expected, because if the application doesn’t understand namespaces, it doesn’t understand that dc:title is both prefix and element name. The localName property is also different. In the XHTML version, this is the element name minus the prefix, which is title. In the HTML version, the localName is dc:title—the prefix becomes just another part of the local name. The only property where both applications return the same value is the textContent of the title. For the most part, the namespace issue shouldn’t be a problem if you’re using pure SVG in your web page, without any elements from other namespaces. Of course, a lot of SVG we find “in the wild” have namespaced elements, including license information that we need to keep with the image. Still, we shouldn’t have too many problems, because we’re mainly going to want to access the SVG elements from client-side Java- Script, rather than the licenses or other namespaced elements. There is another option, and this is where SVGWeb steps in and solves more than one problem. Not only does SVGWeb enable the support of embedded SVG within an HTML document  and not just HTML5 documents , but it corrects the namespace problems. I added the SVGWeb library into Example 15-6, the HTML document, and wrapped the SVG element in a script tag, with the SVG MIME type:     ...      <svg id="svgelem"      height="800" xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg">       ...         Now  when  I  try  the  same  application,  the  results  I  get  from  the  SVGWeb-assisted HTML  page  are  identical  to  the  results  I  get  for  the  XHTML  page.  I  can  use  the  15.7  Enable Interactive SVG Embedded in HTML  343   namespace version of DOM methods, such as document.getElementsByTagNameNS, and get the same results. However,  the  application  doesn’t  work  with  IE8.  The  reason  is  that  when  using SVGWeb with an SVG-enabled browser, such as Safari or Opera, SVGWeb creates the SVG within a XML context, but it is still SVG. However, with IE8, SVGWeb creates the graphic as Flash, not SVG. Because SVGWeb is creating the SVG as Flash, we also have to move the namespace definitions to the outer SVG element:  <svg id="svgelem"      height="800"      xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg"      xmlns:cc="http:  web.resource.org cc "      xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 "      xmlns:rdf="http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns">  ...    Event handling is also managed through SVGWeb, which means we’re going to get unexpected results when using the older DOM Level 0 event handling:  circle.onclick=function   { ... }  Instead, SVGWeb provides cross-browser addEventListener functionality, both for the window object and for all SVG elements. And, instead of capturing the load event for the window, you’ll capture a specialized event, SVGLoad: window.addEventListener "SVGLoad",functionName,false ;  Because the SVGWeb-enabled addEventListener function is implemented using IE’s attachEvent for IE8, the application also doesn’t have access to this, for object context. The external element reference is used instead. Here’s the finished scripting block, which encompasses all of these changes and works in IE8 as well as Safari, Chrome, Opera, and Firefox:          set element onclick event handler   window.addEventListener 'SVGLoad', function    {      var circle = document.getElementById "redcircle" ;          onclick event handler, change circle radius      circle.addEventListener 'click', function evt  {          reference circle, rather than this         var r = parseInt circle.getAttribute "r"  ;         r-=10;         circle.setAttribute "r",r ;          var  dc = document.getElementsByTagNameNS "http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ",  344  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications                                                       "title" ;          for  var i = 0; i < dc.length; i++  {           var str = dc.item i .namespaceURI + " " + dc.item i .prefix + " " +                  dc.item i .localName + " " + dc.item i .textContent;           alert str ;         }       }, false ;    }, false ;    Now the application works in all target browsers, including correct handling of the namespaces. See Also See where to get SVGWeb and how to install it in Recipe 15.6. You’ll want to read the Issues section of the documentation before beginning your project. See Recipe 11.2 for more on using document.getElementsByTagNameNS   and namespa- ces. The issues associated with attachEvent and this are covered in Recipe 7.5.  15.8  Using the Math Functions to Create a Realistic, Ticking Analog Clock in SVG Problem You want to embed an animated analog clock into your site’s sidebar. Solution Use SVG to create the clock, utilizing both the Date object and the Math objects, in addition to a timer to manage the clock hands. The JavaScript to manage the hands is a derivative of other applications that also implement analog clocks, such as Java app- lets from long ago:          var seconds = document.getElementById "seconds" ;     var minutes = document.getElementById "minutes" ;     var hours   = document.getElementById "hours" ;      function setClock date  {       var s =  date.getSeconds   + date.getMilliseconds     1000  *       Math.PI   30;       var m = date.getMinutes   * Math.PI   30 + s   60;       var h = date.getHours   * Math.PI   6 + m   12;        seconds.setAttribute "x2", 0.90 * Math.cos s  ;       seconds.setAttribute "y2", 0.90 * Math.sin s  ;  15.8  Using the Math Functions to Create a Realistic, Ticking Analog Clock in SVG  345         minutes.setAttribute "x2", 0.65 * Math.cos m  ;       minutes.setAttribute "y2", 0.65 * Math.sin m  ;       hours  .setAttribute "x2", 0.40 * Math.cos h  ;       hours  .setAttribute "y2", 0.40 * Math.sin h  ;     }      setInterval "setClock new Date   ", 1000 ;      Discussion The animated analog clock is my own version of “Hello, World” in SVG.  Mine and several other people, because if you search on “SVG analog clock,” you’ll find several very attractive and interesting variations.  I like that it makes use of many unique as- pects of SVG, as well as other JavaScript objects, such as Date and Math. Depending on how fancy you make it, the amount of code is small enough to not strain bandwidth, and the animation is simple enough not to task the CPU. You don’t have to implement the second hand for the clock, though I think it adds more realism. The hands are straight lines that are the same length. With each iteration of  the  timer,  the  orientation  of  the  lines  changes,  using  the  Math.cos  and  Math.sin methods. The values for these methods are derived from a formula that makes use of values accessed from the Date object, and modified using Math.PI. Once you have the clock orientation and the hands, you can go to town on decorating the clock. Figure 15-3 shows one of my favorite clock designs. A basic clock can be found in Example 15-7. All it does is create a clock with tick marks and hands—consider it a drawing board.  Example 15-7.

Basic clock, decorated with eye candy and text Solution One option is to embed both the SVG and the canvas element directly into the X HTML page  we’ll stick with XHTML for now , and then access the canvas element from script within SVG:           canvas item alternative content       <svg id="svgelem"      height="400" xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg">       SVG Circle                       <![CDATA[           window.onload = function    {              var context = document.getElementById "myCanvas" .getContext '2d' ;               context.fillStyle = 'rgba 0,200,0,0.7 ';              context.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;            };           ]]>            348  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications                  Or you can embed the canvas element as a foreign object directly in the SVG:   <svg id="svgelem"      height="400" xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg" xmlns:xhtml="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml">       SVG Circle with metadata                       <![CDATA[           window.onload = function    {              var context2 = document.getElementById "thisCanvas" .getContext '2d' ;              context2.fillStyle = "ff0000";              context2.fillRect 0,0,200,200 ;           };           ]]>                                               alternate content for browsers that do not support Canvas                                      Discussion When the SVG element is embedded into the current web page, you can access HTML elements from within the SVG. However, you can also embed elements directly in SVG, using  the  SVG  foreignObject  element.  This  element  allows  us  to  embed  XHTML, MathML, RDF, or any other XML-based syntax. In both solutions, I was able to use document.getElementById. However, if I wanted to manipulate  the  elements  using  other  methods,  such  as  document.getElementsByTag Name, I had to be careful about which version of the method I use. For instance, I can use getElementsByTagName for the outer canvas element, but I would need to use the namespace version of the method, getElementsByTagNameNS, for the contained canvas element, passing in the XHTML namespace included in the SVG element:  var xhtmlnx = "http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml"; var context = document.getElementsByTagNameNS  xhtmlns,                       'canvas' [0].getContext '2d' ; context.fillStyle = '0f0'; context.fillRect 0,0,100,100 ;  Once you have the canvas context, you use the element like you would from script within HTML: add rectangles, draw paths, create arcs, and so on. Why would you use both at the same time? Each has its own advantages. One use of SVG and Canvas together is to provide a fallback for the canvas element, since the SVG  15.9  Integrating SVG and the Canvas Element in HTML  349   writes to the DOM and persists even if JavaScript is turned off, while the canvas element does not. The canvas element is also faster in frame-type animations. However, the performance advantages you get with the canvas element lessen as you increase the size of the display. SVG scales beautifully.  15.10  Turning on WebGL Support in Firefox and WebKit Safari Problem You want to jump into the world of 3D. Solution Both Firefox nightly  Minefield  and the WebKit nightly have support for WebGL, a cross-platform 3D graphics system derived from the OpenGL effort, and making use of the canvas element. You will have to turn on support for both. For Firefox, access the configuration options page by typing about:config into the ad- dress bar. Once past the warning page, find the webgl.enabled_for_all_sites option, and change the value to true. For WebKit, open a Terminal window and type this at the command line:  defaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitWebGLEnabled -bool YES  Discussion The world of 3D development in browsers is both old and new. Years ago, we had support for various forms of 3D development, such as VRML. However, most imple- mentations required a plug-in, and they weren’t the best-performing functionalities. Today, there’s two different 3D approaches: WebGL, which is an effort being devel- oped and promoted by the Khronos Group, a consortium of media companies; X3D, developed by the Web3D group, which is a descendant of the older VRML effort. The differences between the two is that WebGL is JavaScript-based, with the image developed on the canvas element, while X3D is based in XML:                                         The Khronos Group is working on creating a browser-based runtime that will enable X3D to run on WebGL, and there is discussion ongoing about some form of integration  350  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   between X3D and HTML5. However, from a scripter’s point of view, we’re primarily interested in WebGL. See Also Mozilla has a nice WebGL support page, with tutorials and demos at https:  developer .mozilla.org en WebGL. The WebKit blog also has a nice introduction to WebGL in WebKit at http:  webkit.org blog 603 webgl-now-available-in-webkit-nightlies . There’s also  a  website  devoted  to  WebGL  at  http:  learningwebgl.com blog .  The  Khronos Group website is at http:  www.khronos.org webgl . The X3D for Developers site is at http:  www.web3d.org x3d .  15.11  Running a Routine When an Audio File Begins Playing Problem You want to provide an audio file and then pop up a question or other information when the audio file begins or ends playing. Solution Use the new HTML5 audio element:                     Meadow sounds      and capture its end or play event:  function manageEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } }  window.onload=function   {   var meadow = document.getElementById "meadow" ;   manageEvent meadow,"play",aboutAudio ; }  then display the information:  function aboutAudio   {   var txt = document.createTextNode "This audio file was a recording   from the Shaw Nature Reserve in Missouri" ;   var div = document.createElement "div" ;  15.11  Running a Routine When an Audio File Begins Playing  351     div.appendChild txt ;   div.setAttribute "role","alert" ;   document.body.appendChild div ; }  Discussion HTML5 added two new media elements: audio and video. These simple-to-use controls provide a way to play audio and video files without having to use Flash. In the solution, the audio element’s controls Boolean attribute is provided, so the con- trols are displayed. The element has three source children elements, providing support for three different types of audio files: WAV, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis. The use of the source element allows different browsers to find the format  codec  that they support. For the audio element, the browser support is:    Firefox  3.5 and up  only supports WAV and Ogg Vorbis   Opera  10.5  only supports WAV  at this time    Chrome supports MP3 and Ogg Vorbis   Safari supports MP3 and WAV  IE8 does not support the audio element, but IE9 will, and will most likely only support MP3 and WAV. However, a link to the WAV file is provided as a fallback, which means people using a browser that doesn’t support audio can still access the sound file. I could have also provided an object element, or other fallback content. The new media elements come with a set of methods to control the playback, as well as events that can be triggered when the event occurs. In the solution, the ended event is captured and assigned the event handler aboutAudio, which displays a message about the file after the playback is finished. Notice that though I’m using a DOM Level 0 event handler with the window load event, I’m using DOM Level 2 event handling with the audio element. The reason is that at the time I wrote this, making an assignment to the element’s onplay  or onended  event did not work. However, I could use the DOM Level 2 event handler and the inline event handler without a problem:  <audio id="meadow" src="meadow.wav" controls onended="alert 'All done' ">   Meadow sounds      It’s interesting seeing the appearance of the elements in all of the browsers that currently support them. There is no standard look, so each browser provides its own interpre- tation. You can control the appearance by providing your own playback controls and using your own elements CSS SVG Canvas to supply the decoration.  352  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   See Also See Recipe 15.12 for a demonstration of using the playback methods and providing alternative visual representations for the new media elements, as well as providing a different form of fallback.  15.12  Controlling Video from JavaScript with the video Element Problem You want to embed video in your web page, and not use Flash. You also want a con- sistent look for the video control, regardless of browser and operating system. Solution Use the new HTML5 video element:                      <param name="movie" value="http:  www.youtube.com v CNRTeSoSbgg&hl=en_US&fs=1&">     <embed src="http:  www.youtube.com v CNRTeSoSbgg&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application x-shockwave-flash"    allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344">     Audio slideshow from Shaw Nature Center      And provide controls for it via JavaScript, as shown in Example 15-8. Buttons are used to provide the video control, and text in a div element is used to provide feedback on time during the playback.  Example 15-8. Providing a custom control for the HTML5 video element       Meadow Video     function manageEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } }  15.12  Controlling Video from JavaScript with the video Element   353   window.onload=function   {       events for buttons   manageEvent document.getElementById "start" ,"click",startPlayback ;   manageEvent document.getElementById "stop" ,"click",stopPlayback ;   manageEvent document.getElementById "pause" ,"click",pausePlayback ;       setup for video playback   var meadow = document.getElementById "meadow" ;   manageEvent meadow,"timeupdate",reportProgress ;       video fallback   var detect = document.createElement "video" ;   if  !detect.canPlayType  {     document.getElementById "controls" .style.display="none";   } }     start video, enable stop and pause    disable play function startPlayback   {   var meadow = document.getElementById "meadow" ;   meadow.play  ;   document.getElementById "pause" .disabled=false;   document.getElementById "stop" .disabled=false;   this.disabled=true; }     pause video, enable start, disable stop    disable pause function pausePlayback   {   document.getElementById "meadow" .pause  ;   this.disabled=true;   document.getElementById "start" .disabled=false;   document.getElementById "stop" .disabled=true; }     stop video, return to zero time    enable play, disable pause and stop function stopPlayback   {   var meadow = document.getElementById "meadow" ;   meadow.pause  ;   meadow.currentTime=0;   document.getElementById "start" .disabled=false;   document.getElementById "pause" .disabled=true;   this.disabled=true; }     for every time divisible by 5, output feedback function reportProgress   {   var time = Math.round this.currentTime ;   var div = document.getElementById "feedback" ;   div.innerHTML = time + " seconds"; }  354  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications                              <param name="movie" value="http:  www.youtube.com v CNRTeSoSbgg&hl=en_US&fs=1&">     <embed src="http:  www.youtube.com v CNRTeSoSbgg&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application x-shockwave-flash"    allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344">     Audio slideshow from Shaw Nature Center           Play   Stop   Pause      Discussion The new HTML5 video element, as with the HTML5 audio element, can be controlled with  its  own  built-in  controls,  or  you  can  provide  your  own,  as  shown  in  Exam- ple 15-8. The media elements support the following methods:  play  pause  load  Starts playing the video  Pauses the video  Preloads the video without starting play  canPlayType  Tests if the user agent supports the video type  The media elements don’t support a stop method, so I emulated one by pausing video play and then setting the video’s currentTime attribute to 0, which basically resets the play start time. The only browser this didn’t work in was Chrome. It worked in Opera 10.5, Firefox 3.5, and WebKit Safari. I also used currentTime to print out the video time, using Math.round to round the time to the nearest second, as shown in Figure 15-4.  15.12  Controlling Video from JavaScript with the video Element   355   Figure 15-4. Playing a video using the video control, displaying the number of seconds of video  The  video  control  is  providing  two  different  video  codecs:  H.264   .mp4 ,  and  Ogg Theora  .ogv . Firefox, Opera, and Chrome support Ogg Theora, but Safari WebKit only supports the H.264 formatted video. However, by providing both types, the video works in all of the browsers that support the video element. For the browsers that currently don’t support video, such as IE, the fallback YouTube video is provided, and if that doesn’t work, then there’s text. In addition, if the video element is not supported, the video controls are hidden. The video and audio controls are inherently keyboard-accessible. If you do replace the controls, you’ll want to provide accessibility information with your replacements. The video control doesn’t have built-in captioning, but work is underway to provide the API for captioning.  356  Chapter 15: Creating Media Rich and Interactive Applications   Microsoft has stated it will support the video element in IE9, and the H.264 codec.  See Also For  more  on  the  new  video audio  elements,  see  Opera’s  introduction,  Safari Web Kit’s, and Mozilla’s. A good place for more information on Ogg Theora is the Theora Cookbook. At the time this book entered production, Google had released another video codec, WebM, for royalty free access. Several browsers have promised to support this codec. For more information, see the WebM Project site.  15.12  Controlling Video from JavaScript with the video Element   357    CHAPTER 16 JavaScript Objects  16.0  Introduction Your JavaScript applications can consist entirely of functions and variables—both local and global—but if you want to ensure ease of reuse, compactness of code, and effi- ciency, as well as code that plays well with other libraries, you’re going to need to consider opportunities to encapsulate your code into objects. Luckily, working with objects in JavaScript isn’t much more complicated than working with functions. After all, a JavaScript function is an object, and all objects are, techni- cally, just functions. Confused yet? Unlike languages such as Java or C++, which are based on classes and class instances, JavaScript is based on prototypal inheritance. What prototypal inheritance means is that reuse occurs through creating new instances of existing objects, rather than in- stances of a class. Instead of extensibility occurring through class inheritance, proto- typal extensibility happens by enhancing an existing object with new properties and methods. Prototype-based languages have an advantage in that you don’t have to worry about creating the classes first, and then the applications. You can focus on creating appli- cations, and then deriving the object framework via the effort. It sounds like a mishmash concept, but hopefully as you walk through the recipes you’ll get a better feel for JavaScript’s prototype-based, object-oriented capabilities.  ECMAScript and all its variations, including JavaScript, isn’t the only prototype-based language. The Wikipedia page on prototype-based lan guages, lists several.  359   See Also Several of the recipes in this book are based on new functionality that was introduced in ECMAScript 5. You can access the complete ECMAScript 5 specification  a PDF  at http:  www.ecmascript.org docs tc39-2009-043.pdf. Note that the implementation of the new functionality is sketchy. I’ll point out browser support as I go.  16.1  Defining a Basic JavaScript Object Problem You want to create a custom, reusable JavaScript object. Solution Define a new object explicitly using functional syntax, and then create new instances, passing in the data the object constructor is expecting:  function Tune  song, artist  {    this.title = song;    this.artist = artist;    this.concat=function   {       return this.title + "-" + this.artist;    } }  window.onload=function   {    var happySong = new Array  ;    happySong[0] = new Tune "Putting on the Ritz", "Ella Fitzgerald" ;        print out title and artist    alert happySong[0].concat   ; }  Discussion As you can see from the solution, there is no class description, as you might expect if you’ve used other languages. A new object is created as a function, with three members: two properties, title and artist, and one method, concat. You could even use it like a function:  Tune "test","artist" ;  However, using the object like a function, as compared to using it as an object con- structor, has an odd and definitely unexpected consequence. The new keyword is used to create a new Tune instance. Values are passed into the object constructor, which are then assigned to the Tune properties, title and artist, via the this keyword. In the solution, this is a reference to the object instance. When you  360  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   assign the property values to the object instance, you can then access them at a later time, using syntax like happySong[0].title. In addition, the Tune object’s concat meth- od also has access to these properties. However, when you use Tune like a regular function, this doesn’t represent an object instance, because there isn’t any. Instead, this references the owner of the Tune func- tion, which in this case, is the global window object:     treating Tune like a function Tune "the title", "the singer" ; alert window.concat   ;    lo and behold,                            "the title the singer" prints out  Completely unexpected and unwelcome behavior. To summarize: to create a new object type, you can create a function with both prop- erties and methods. To ensure the properties are assigned to the correct object, treat the object like a constructor using the  new operator, rather than as a function. The this keyword establishes ownership of the properties, which is the Tune object instance, if the function is used as an object constructor and not a regular function. See Also See Recipe 16.2 for more information about the role this plays with JavaScript objects.  16.2  Keeping Object Members Private Problem You want to keep one or more object properties private, so they can’t be accessed outside the object instance. Solution When  creating  the  private  data  members,  do  not  use  the  this  keyword  with  the member:  function Tune song,artist  {    var title = song;    var artist = artist;    this.concat = function   {       return title + " " + artist;    } }  window.onload=function   {     var happySongs = new Array  ;   happySongs[0] = new Tune "Putting on the Ritz", "Ella Fitzgerald" ;     try {  16.2  Keeping Object Members Private  361           error      alert happySongs[0].title ;    } catch e  {      alert e ;    }        prints out correct title and artist    alert happySongs[0].concat   ; }  Discussion Members in the object constructor  the function body , are not accessible outside the object unless they’re assigned to that object using this. If they’re attached to the object using the var keyword, only the Tune’s inner function, the concat method, can access these now-private data members. This  type  of  method—one  that  can  access  the  private  data  members,  but  is,  itself, exposed to public access via this—has been termed a privileged method by Douglas Crockford, the father of JSON  JavaScript Object Notation . As he himself explains  at http:  www.crockford.com javascript private.html :  This pattern of public, private, and privileged members is possible because JavaScript has closures. What this means is that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This is an extremely powerful property of the language [. . . .] Private and privileged members can only be made when an object is constructed. Public members can be added at any time.  See Also See Recipe 6.5 for more on function closures. See Recipe 16.3 for more on adding public members after the object has been defined.  16.3  Expanding Objects with prototype You want to extend an existing object with a new method. Solution Use the Object prototype to extend the object:  Tune.prototype.addCategory = function categoryName  {    this.category = categoryName; }  Discussion Every object in JavaScript inherits from Object, and all methods and other properties are inherited via the prototype object. It’s through the prototype object that we can  362  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   extend any object, and that includes the built-in objects, such as String and Number. Once an object has been extended via the prototype property, all instances of the object within the scope of the application have this functionality. In Example 16-1, the new object, Tune, is defined using function syntax. It has two private data members, a title and an artist. A publicly accessible method, concat, takes these two private data members, concatenates them, and returns the result. After a new instance of the object is created, and the object is extended with a new method  and  data  member,  the  new  method  is  used  to  update  the  existing  object instance.  Example 16-1. Instantiating a new object, adding values, and extending the object       Tune Object       function Tune song,artist  {     var title = song;     var artist = artist;     this.concat = function   {       return title + " " + artist;     }   }  window.onload=function   {      create instance, print out values   var happySong = new Tune "Putting on the Ritz", "Ella Fitzgerald" ;       extend the object   Tune.prototype.addCategory = function categoryName  {       this.category = categoryName;   }       add category   happySong.addCategory "Swing" ;       print song out to new paragraph   var song = "Title and artist: " + happySong.concat   +              " Category: " + happySong.category;   var p = document.createElement "p" ;   var txt = document.createTextNode song ;   p.appendChild txt ;   document.getElementById "song" .appendChild p ; }          Tune   16.3  Expanding Objects with prototype  363            Figure 16-1 shows the page after the new element and data have been appended.  Figure 16-1. Demonstration of custom JavaScript object after values printed out  The prototype property can also be used to override or extend external or global objects. Before ECMAScript 5 added trim as a default method for the String object, applications used to extend the String object by adding a trim method through the prototype object:  String.prototype.trim = function   {   return  this.replace  ^[\s\xA0]+ , "" .replace  [\s\xA0]+$ , ""  ; }  Needless to say, you’d want to use extreme caution when using this functionality with global objects. Applications that have extended the String object with a homegrown trim method may end up behaving differently than applications using the new standard trim method. Using prototype with your own objects is usually safe. The only time you may run into problems is if you provide your objects as an external library, and others build on them.  16.4  Adding Getter Setter to Objects Problem You want to provide property access to protected data. Solution Use the getter setter functionality introduced with ECMAScript 3.1 with your  or out- side  objects:  364  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   function Tune   {   var artist;   var song;    this.__defineGetter__ "artist",function   {       return artist} ;    this.__defineSetter__ "artist",function val  {       artist = "By: " + val} ;    this.__defineGetter__ "song",function   {       return "Song: " + song} ;    this.__defineSetter__ "song",function val  {       song=val} ; }  window.onload=function   {   var happySong = new Tune  ;    happySong.artist="Ella Fitzgerald";   happySong.song="Putting on the Ritz";    alert happySong.song + " " + happySong.artist ; }  Discussion We  can  add  functions  to  our  objects  to  get  private  data,  as  demonstrated  in  Rec- ipe 16.2. However, when we use the functions, they are obvious functions. The getter  setter functionality is a special syntax that provides property-like access to private data members. The getter and setter functions provide an extra layer of protection for the private data members. The functions also allow us to prepare the data, as demonstrated with the solution, where the song and artist strings are concatenated to labels. You can define the getter and setter functions within the object constructor, as shown in the solution:  this.__defineGetter__ "song",function   {       return "Song: " + song} ;  this.__defineSetter__ "song",function val  {       song=val} ;  var p = Tune.prototype;  p.__defineGetter__ "song",function   {     return "Song: " + title} ;  You can also add a getter setter with other objects, including DOM objects. To add a getter setter  outside  of  the  object  constructor,  you  first  need  to  access  the  object’s prototype object, and then add the getter setter functions to the prototype:  16.4  Adding Getter Setter to Objects   365   p.__defineSetter__ "song",function val  {     title=val} ;  You can also use getter setters with “one-off” objects, used to provide JavaScript name- spacing  covered later in the chapter :  var Book = {    title: "The JavaScript Cookbook",    get booktitle   {       return this.title;    },    set booktitle val  {       this.title = val;    } };  Book.booktitle = "Learning JavaScript";  This approach can’t be used to hide the data, but can be used to control the display of the data, or to provide special processing of the incoming data before it’s stored in the data member.  The getter setter functionality does not work in IE8 or earlier.  See Also See Recipe 16.6 for demonstrations of the new ECMAScript 5 property methods. Rec- ipe 16.11 covers JavaScript namespacing.  16.5  Inheriting an Object’s Functionality Problem When creating a new object type, you want to inherit the functionality of an existing JavaScript object. Solution Use the concept of constructor chaining and the Function.apply method to emulate traditional class inheritance behavior in JavaScript:  function oldObject param1  {    this.param1 = param1;    this.getParam=function   {       return this.param1;    } }  366  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   function newObject param1,param2  {    this.param2 = param2;    this.getParam2 = function   {       return this.param2;    }    oldObject.apply this,arguments ;    this.getAllParameters=function   {       return this.getParam   + " " + this.getParam2  ;    } }  window.onload=function   {    newObject.prototype = new oldObject  ;    var obj = new newObject "value1","value2" ;        prints out both parameters    alert obj.getAllParameters   ; }  Discussion In the solution, we have two objects: the original, oldObject, and newObject that inherits functionality from the older object. For this to work, a couple of things are happening. First, in the constructor for newObject, an apply method is called on oldObject, passing in a reference to the new object, and the argument array. The apply method is inherited from the Function object, and takes a reference to the calling object, or the window object if the value is null, and an optional argument array. The second part of the inheritance is the line:  newObject.prototype=new oldObject  ;  This is an example of constructor chaining in JavaScript. What happens is when you create a new instance of newObject, you’re also creating a new instance of oldObject, in such a way that newObject inherits both the older object’s methods and property. It is this combination of constructor chaining, which chains the constructors of the new objects together, and the apply method, which passes both object context and data to the inherited object, that implements inheritance behavior in JavaScript. Because of this inheritance, the new object has access not only to its own property, param2, and method, getParam2, but also has access to the old object’s param1 and getParam property and method. To see another example of JavaScript inheritance, Example 16-2 shows it working with another couple of objects: a Book object and a TechBook object, which inherits from Book. The lines that implement the inheritance are bolded.  16.5  Inheriting an Object’s Functionality  367   Example 16-2. Demonstrating object inheritance in JavaScript       Constructor Chaining     function Book  title, author  {   var title = title;   var author = author;   this.getTitle=function   {      return "Title: " + title;   }   this.getAuthor=function   {      return "Author: " + author;   } }  function TechBook  title, author, category  {     var category = category;    this.getCategory = function   {      return "Technical Category: " + category;    }     Book.apply this,arguments ;    this.getBook=function   {     return this.getTitle   + " " + author + " " + this.getCategory  ;    } }  window.onload=function   {       chain the object constructors   TechBook.prototype = new Book  ;       get all values   var newBook = new TechBook "The JavaScript Cookbook",   "Shelley Powers", "Programming" ;   alert newBook.getBook   ;       now, individually   alert newBook.getTitle   ;   alert newBook.getAuthor   ;   alert newBook.getCategory   ; }         some content     368  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   Unlike the objects in the solution, all of the data members in both objects in Exam- ple 16-2 are protected, which means the data can’t be directly accessed outside the objects. Yet notice when all three Book properties—title, author, and category—are printed out via the getBook method in the TechBook object, that TechBook has access to the Book author and title properties, in addition to its own category. That’s because when the new TechBook object was created, a new Book object was also created and inherited by the new TechBook object. To complete the inheritance, the data used in the constructor for TechBook is passed through the Book object using the apply method. Not only can the TechBook object directly access the Book instance data, you can access both of the Book object’s methods, getAuthor and getCategory, directly on the instan- tiated TechBook object instance.  16.6  Extending an Object by Defining a New Property Problem You want to extend an existing object by adding a new property, but without changing the object’s constructor function. Solution Use the new ECMAScript Object.defineProperty method to define one property:  Object.defineProperty newBook, "publisher", {        value: "O'Reilly",        writable: false,        enumerable: true,        configurable: true} ;  Use the Object.defineProperties method to define more than one property:  Object.defineProperties newBook, {      "stock": {         value: true,         writable: true,         enumerable: true,      },      "age": {         value: "13 and up",         writable: false      }    } ; Discussion Properties are handled differently in ECMAScript 5. Where before all you could do was assign a value, now you have greater control over how an object’s properties are man- aged. This greater control comes about through the provision for several new attributes  16.6  Extending an Object by Defining a New Property  369   that can be assigned to a property when it’s created. These new attributes make up what is known as the property descriptor object, and include:  writable  configurable  enumerable  If true, property can be changed; otherwise, not.  If true, property can be deleted, or changed; otherwise, not.  If true, property can be iterated.  The type of property descriptor can also vary. If the descriptor is a data descriptor, another attribute is value, demonstrated in the solution and equivalent to the following:  someObject.newProperty = "somevalue";  If the descriptor is an accessor descriptor, the property has a getter setter, similar to what was covered in Recipe 16.4. A restriction when defining an accessor property is that you can’t set the writable attribute:   Object.defineProperty TechBook, "category", {     get: function    { return category; },     set: function  value  { category = value; },     enumerable: true,     configurable: true} ; var newBook = new TechBook ... ; newBook.publisher="O'Reilly";  You can also discover information about the property descriptor for a property with the  Object.getOwnPropertyDescription  method.  To  use,  pass  in  the  object  and  the property name whose property descriptor you wish to review:  var propDesc = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor newBook,"category" ; alert propDesc.writable ;    true if writable, otherwise false  The property has to be publicly accessible  not a private member . Easily view all of the property attributes using the JSON object’s stringify method:  var val = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor TechBook,"category" ; alert JSON.stringify val  ;    {"enumerable":true,"configurable":true}  If the property descriptor configurable attribute is set to true, you can change descrip- tor attributes. For instance, to change the writable attribute from false to true, use the following:  Object.defineProperty newBook, "publisher", {    writable: true} ;  The previously set attributes retain their existing values. Example 16-3 demonstrates the new property descriptors, first on a DOM object, then a custom object.  370  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   Example 16-3.

At the time I wrote this recipe, they only work in nightly builds for WebKit and Firefox  Minefield , and in a very limited sense with IE8. The IE8 limitation is that the new property methods only work with DOM elements. The Object.defineProperty method works with the Image element, but not with the custom objects. However, using defineProperty on DOM elements causes an exception in WebKit. None of the new property methods work with Opera. The Firefox Minefield nightly and the Chrome beta were the only browsers that currently work with both types of objects, as shown in Figure 16-2, which displays the Image object properties in Firefox.  Figure 16-2. Displaying Image properties after adding a new property with defineProperty  16.6  Extending an Object by Defining a New Property  373   After printing out the Image properties, a new property  experience  and property de- scriptor are added to the TechBook custom object. The Object.getOwnPropertyDescrip tor is called, passing in the TechBook object and the property name, experience. The property descriptor object is returned, and the JSON.stringify method is used on the object to print out the values:  {"enumerable":false,"configurable:true}  Next,  the  property  descriptor  values  are  tested.  Currently,  because  the  experience property is not enumerable, the use of the for...in loop can’t enumerate through the properties, and the result is:  Techbook has prototype  The new experience property’s enumerable attribute is then changed to true, because the property descriptor for experience allows modification on descriptor values. Enu- merating over the experience property now yields the following string for Firefox:  Techbook has prototype experience  However, Chrome does not pick up the prototype property. The next two lines of code create a new instance of the TechBook object and adds an experience, which is then printed out to demonstrate the success of the property. The  last  code  in  the  example  adds  another  new  property   publisher   and  property descriptor.  This  is  a  data  property  descriptor,  which  can  also  take  a  default  value: “O’Reilly”. The writable property descriptor is set to false, and configurable and enu- merable descriptors are set to true. The code then tries to change the publisher value. However, the original publisher value of O'Reilly prints out because the publisher property writable attribute is set to false. See Also See Recipe 16.7 for more on property enumeration. Though not all browsers support defineProperty and defineProperties yet, there are workarounds, as detailed by John Resig in a nice article describing the new object property capabilities.  16.7  Enumerating an Object’s Properties Problem You want to see what properties an object has. Solution Use a specialized variation of the for loop to iterate through the properties:  for  var prop in obj  {    alert prop ;    prints out the property name }  374  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   or use the new ECMAScript 5 Object.keys method to return the names for all properties that can be enumerated:  alert Object.keys obj .join ", "  ;  or use another new ECMAScript 5 method, Object.getOwnPropertyNames obj , to get the names of all properties, whether they can be enumerated or not:  var props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames obj ;  Discussion For an object instance, newBook, based on the following object definitions:   function Book  title, author  {   var title = title;   this.author = author;   this.getTitle=function   {      return "Title: " + title;   }   this.getAuthor=function   {      return "Author: " + author;   } }  function TechBook  title, author, category  {     var category = category;    this.getCategory = function   {      return "Technical Category: " + category;    }     Book.apply this,arguments ;    this.getBook=function   {     return this.getTitle   + " " + author + " " + this.getCategory  ;    } }       chain the object constructors   TechBook.prototype = new Book  ;       create new tech book   var newBook = new TechBook "The JavaScript Cookbook", "Shelley Powers", "Programming" ;  using the for...in loop:  var str = ""; for  var prop in newBook  {    str = str + prop + " "; }  alert str ;  a message pops up with the following values:  getCategory author getTitle getAuthor getBook  16.7  Enumerating an Object’s Properties   375   Neither the category property in TechBook nor the title property in Book are returned, as these are private data members. When using WebKit nightly or Firefox Minefield, the same result is returned when using the new Object.keys method:  alert Object.keys newBook .join " "  ;  The same result is also returned, again with WebKit nightly or Firefox Minefield, when using the new Object.getOwnPropertyNames method:  var props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames newBook ; alert props.join " "  ;  However, if I add a property descriptor for the title property, making it enumerable:     test data descriptor Object.defineProperty newBook, "title", {        writable: true,        enumerable: true,        configurable: true} ;  When I enumerate over the properties again, this time the title displays among the properties, even though it still can’t be accessed or reset directly on the object. We can also use these same property enumerators over the object constructors  Book or TechBook  or any of the built-in objects. However, the values we get back when we enumerate over Book, as compared to the instance, newBook, do vary among the methods. The for...in loop returns just one property, prototype, as does the Object.keys meth- od. That’s because prototype is the only enumerable property for the Function object. While newBook is an instance of Book, Book, itself is an instance of the Function object. The Object.getOwnPropertyNames, however, returns the following set of properties for Book:  arguments callee caller length name prototype  Unlike Object.keys and the for...in loop, Object.getOwnPropertyNames returns a list of all properties, not just those that are enumerable. This leads to a new question: why did  Object.getOwnPropertyNames  not  return  all  of  the  properties  for  the  newBook  in- stance?  It  should  have  picked  up  title  before  it  was  made  enumerable,  as  well  as TechBook’s private member, category. I added another property descriptor to newBook, this time for category, and this time with enumerable set to false:  Object.defineProperty newBook,"category", {        writable: true,        enumerable: false,        configurable: true} ;  The category property isn’t listed when I use for...in or Object.keys, but this time it is picked up by Object.getOwnPropertyNames. It would seem that a property must either be publicly accessible, or have a property descriptor for it to be picked up by Object.getOwnPropertyNames, at least for these earlier  376  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   implementations of these new Object methods. I imagine the reason is to ensure con- sistent results between older ECMAScript implementations and newer ones: defining a property in older versions of ECMAScript is not the same as defining a property in the newer version. Speaking of ECMAScript 5 and new Object methods, support for the older for...in loop is broad, but support for Object.keys and Object.getOwnPropertyNames, in addi- tion to support for property descriptors, is sparse at this time. Opera does not support defineProperty and the associated new ECMAScript 5 functionality. WebKit nightly and the Chrome beta support all of the new functionality, while the Firefox nightly  Minefield , supports Object.keys, but not getOwnPropertyNames. IE8’s coverage is limi- ted because it only supports the new methods on DOM elements, such as Image, and not on custom objects. See Also For more on property descriptors, see Recipe 16.6.  16.8  Preventing Object Extensibility Problem You want to prevent others from extending an object. Solution Use the new ECMAScript 5 Object.preventExtensions method to lock an object against future property additions:  "use strict";  var Test = {     value1 : "one",     value2 : function   {       return this.value1;     } };  try {    Object.preventExtensions Test ;  } catch e  {    alert e ; }        the following fails, and throws an exception in Strict mode   Test.value3 = "test";  16.8  Preventing Object Extensibility  377   Discussion Covering Object.preventExtensions is a leap of faith on my part, as no browser has implemented this new ECMAScript 5 functionality. However, by the time this book hits the streets, I expect  hope  at least a couple of browsers will have implemented this new feature. The Object.preventExtensions method prevents developers from extending the object with new properties, though property values themselves are still writable. It sets an internal property, Extensible, to false. You can check to see if an object is extensible using Object.isExtensible:  if  Object.isExtensible obj   {       extend the object }  Though you can’t extend the object, you can edit existing property values, as well as modify the object’s property descriptor. See Also Recipe 16.6 covers property descriptors.  Strict Mode  Another new ECMAScript 5 addition is demonstrated in the solution for Recipe 16.8: the new Strict mode. You can now put an application within a strict operating mode, which means that older, deprecated features are disabled or generate errors, and actions that may not throw errors but are not advisable will throw errors. It’s a way of inherently ensuring production-quality code. The ECMAScript 5 specification details what happens in Strict mode throughout the document. For instance, if you use the deprecated with statement, the application will throw an error; the use of the delete operator with a variable, function argument, or function will also generate an error; most uses of eval will generate errors, and so on. Annex C of the ECMAScript 5 specification lists all of the Strict mode restrictions and exceptions. To turn Strict mode on, use the following at the top level of your code:  This includes quotes. Or, you can turn on Strict mode only within a function:  "use strict";  function somename   {    "use strict"; };  When  creating  custom  JavaScript  objects,  you  can  ensure  their  quality  by  using Strict mode. Currently, no browsers support Strict mode, but all plan to eventually.  378  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   16.9  Preventing Object Additions and Changes to Property Descriptors Problem You want to prevent extensions to an object, but you also want to disallow someone from changing the property descriptor for an object. Solution Use the new ECMAScript Object.seal method to seal the object against additions and modification of its property descriptor:  "use strict";   var Test = {     value1 : "one",     value2 : function   {       return this.value1;     }   }    try {         freeze the object      Object.seal Test ;          the following would succeed      Test.value2 = "two";          the following would fail, throw an error in Strict Mode      Test.newProp = "value3";           so would the following       Object.defineProperty Title, "category", {          get: function    { return category; },          set: function  value  { category = value; },          enumerable: true,          configurable: true} ;    } catch e  {       alert e ;    }  Discussion Like Object.preventExtension, covered in Recipe 16.8, the Object.seal method is an- other new ECMAScript 5 method that has no browser implementation yet, but should, knock on wood, by the time you read this book. Look for a first implementation in a Safari nightly build or a Firefox Minefield build.  16.9  Preventing Object Additions and Changes to Property Descriptors   379   The Object.seal method prevents extensions to an object, like Object.preventExten sions, but also prevents any changes to the object’s property descriptor. To check if an object is sealed, you would use the Object.isSealed method:  if  Object.isSealed obj   ...  See Also Property descriptors are described in Recipe 16.6, and  Object.preventExtensions is covered in Recipe 16.8.  16.10  Preventing Any Changes to an Object Problem You’ve defined your object, and now you want to make sure that its properties aren’t redefined or edited by other applications using the object. Solution Use the new ECMAScript 5 Object.freeze method to freeze the object against any and all changes:  "use strict";   var Test = {     value1 : "one",     value2 : function   {       return this.value1;     }   }  try {      freeze the object   Object.freeze Test ;       the following would throw an error in Strict Mode   Test.value2 = "two";        so would the following    Test.newProperty = "value";        and so would the following    Object.defineProperty Title, "category", {       get: function    { return category; },       set: function  value  { category = value; },       enumerable: true,       configurable: true} ; } catch e  {    alert e ; }  380  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   Discussion There are several new Object methods defined in ECMAScript 5 to provide better object management in JavaScript. The least restrictive is Object.preventExtensions obj , cov- ered in Recipe 16.6, which disallows adding new properties to an object, but you can change the object’s property descriptor, or modify an existing property value. The next more restrictive method is Object.seal. The Object.seal obj  method pre- vents any modifications or new properties from being added to the property descriptor, but you can modify an existing property value. The  most  restrictive  new  ECMAScript  5  Object  method  is  Object.freeze.  The Object.freeze obj  method disallows extensions to the object, and restricts changes to the property descriptor. However, Object.freeze also prevents any and all edits to existing object properties. Literally, once the object is frozen, that’s it—no additions, no changes to existing properties. You  can  check  to  see  if  an  object  is  frozen  using  the  companion  method, Object.isFrozen:  if  Object.isFrozen obj   ...  No  browser  currently  implements  Object.freeze  or  Object.isFrozen,  but  this  state should change relatively soon. See Also Recipe  16.6  covers  property  descriptors,  Recipe  16.8  covers  Object.preventExten sions, and Recipe 16.9 covers Object.seal.  16.11  One-Off Objects and Namespacing Your JavaScript Problem You want to encapsulate your library functionality in such a way as to prevent clashes with other libraries. Solution Use an object literal, what I call a one-off object, to implement the JavaScript version of namespacing. An example is the following:  var jscbObject = {        return element    getElem : function  identifier  {       return document.getElementById identifier ;    },     stripslashes : function str  {  16.11  One-Off Objects and Namespacing Your JavaScript   381         return str.replace  \\ g, '' ;    },     removeAngleBrackets: function str  {       return str.replace    g,'&gt;' ;    } };  var incoming = jscbObject.getElem "incoming" ; var content = incoming.innerHTML;  var result = jscbObject.stripslashes content ; result = jscbObject.removeAngleBrackets result ;  jscbObject.getElem "result" .innerHTML=result;  Discussion As mentioned elsewhere in this book, all built-in objects in JavaScript have a literal representation in addition to their more formal object representation. For instance, an Array can be created as follows:  var newArray = new Array 'one','two','three' ;  or using the array literal notation:  var newArray = ['one','two','three'];  The same is true for objects. The notation for object literals is pairs of property names and associated values, separated by commas, and wrapped in curly brackets:  The property value pairs are separated by colons. The properties can be scalar data values, or they can be functions. The object members can then be accessed using the object dot-notation:  var newObj = {     prop1 : "value",     prop2 : function   { ... },     ... };  var tmp = newObj.prop2  ;  var val = newObj.prop1 * 20;  Or:  Or:  getElem "result" .innerHTML=result;  Using an object literal, we can wrap all of our library’s functionality in such a way that the functions and variables we need aren’t in the global space. The only global object is the actual object literal, and if we use a name that incorporates functionality, group, purpose, author, and so on, in a unique manner, we effectively namespace the func- tionality, preventing name clashes with other libraries.  382  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   This is the approach I use for every library, whether I create the library or use another, such as jQuery, Dojo, Prototype, and so on. As we’ll see later in the book, object literal notation is also the notation used by JSON, which is now formally a part of the EC- MAScript 5 specification. See Also See Recipe 17.1 for a discussion related to packaging your code into a library for external distribution. Also check out Chapter 19 for recipes related to JSON.  16.12  Rediscovering “this” with Prototype.bind Problem You want to control the scope assigned a given function. Solution Use the new ECMAScript 5 function bind method:  window.onload=function   {     window.name = "window";     var newObject = {       name: "object",        sayGreeting: function   {             alert "Now this is easy, " + this.name ;             nestedGreeting = function greeting  {               alert greeting + " " + this.name ;             }.bind this ;              nestedGreeting "hello" ;        }    }     newObject.sayGreeting "hello" ; }  Function.prototype.bind = function scope  {   var _function = this;    return function   {     return _function.apply scope, arguments ;   } }  If the method isn’t supported in your target browser s , extend the Function object with the code popularized by the Prototype.js JavaScript library:  16.12  Rediscovering “this” with Prototype.bind  383   Discussion The this keyword represents the owner or scope of the function. The challenge asso- ciated with this in current JavaScript libraries is that we can’t guarantee which scope applies to a function. In the solution, the literal object has a method, sayGreeting, which prints a message out  using  an  alert,  and  then  maps  another  nested  function  to  its  property, nestedGreeting. Without the Function.bind method, the first message printed out would say, “Now this is easy object”, but the second would say, “hello window”. The reason the second printout references a different name is that the nesting of the function disassociates the inner function from the surrounding object, and all unscoped functions automatically become the property of the window object. What the bind method does is use the apply method to bind the function to the object passed to the object. In the example, the bind method is invoked on the nested function, binding it with the parent object using the apply method. bind is particularly useful for timers, such as setInterval. Example 16-4 is a web page with script that uses setTimeout to perform a countdown operation, from 10 to 0. As the numbers are counted down, they’re inserted into the web page using the element’s innerHTML property. Since most browsers have not implemented  Function.bind as a standard method yet, I added the Function.prototype.bind functional code.  Example 16-4. Demonstration of the utility of Function.bind for timers       Using bind with timers      item { font-size: 72pt; margin: 70px auto;         width: 100px;}       if  !Function.bind  {    Function.prototype.bind = function scope  {       var _function = this;        return function   {         return _function.apply scope, arguments ;       }    } }  window.onload=function   {    var theCounter = new Counter 'item',10,0 ;    theCounter.countDown  ;  384  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   }  function Counter id,start,finish  {    this.count = this.start = start;    this.finish = finish;    this.id = id;    this.countDown = function   {       if  this.count == this.finish  {          this.countDown=null;          return;       }       document.getElementById this.id .innerHTML=this.count--;       setTimeout this.countDown.bind this ,1000 ;    };  }         10      If the line in bold text in the code sample had been the following:  setTimeout this.countDown, 1000 ;  The application wouldn’t have worked, because the object scope and counter would have been lost when the method was invoked in the timer.  16.13  Chaining Your Object’s Methods Problem You wish to define your object’s methods in such a way that more than one can be used at the same time, like the following, which retrieves a reference to a page element and sets the element’s style property:  document.getElementById "elem" .setAttribute "class","buttondiv" ;  Solution The ability to directly call one function on the result of another in the same line of code is known as method chaining. It requires specialized code in whatever method you want to chain.  16.13  Chaining Your Object’s Methods   385   For instance, if you want to be able to chain the changeAuthor method in the following object, you must also return the object after you perform whatever other functionality you need:  function Book  title, author  {   var title = title;   var author = author;   this.getTitle=function   {      return "Title: " + title;   }    this.getAuthor=function   {      return "Author: " + author;   }    this.replaceTitle = function  newTitle  {     var oldTitle = title;     title = newTitle;   }    this.replaceAuthor = function newAuthor  {     var oldAuthor = author;     author = newAuthor;   } }  function TechBook  title, author, category  {     var category = category;    this.getCategory = function   {      return "Technical Category: " + category;    }     Book.apply this,arguments ;    this.changeAuthor = function newAuthor  {      this.replaceAuthor newAuthor ;      return this;    } }  window.onload=function   {  try {   var newBook = new TechBook "I Know Things", "Shelley Powers", "tech" ;  alert newBook.changeAuthor "Book K. Reader" .getAuthor   ;  } catch e  {    alert e.message ; }  }  386  Chapter 16: JavaScript Objects   Discussion The key to making method chaining work is to return a reference to the object at the end of the method, as shown in the replaceAuthor method in the solution:  this.changeAuthor = function newAuthor  {   this.replaceAuthor newAuthor ;   return this; }  In this example, the line return this returns the object reference. Chaining is extensively used within the DOM methods, as shown throughout this book, when we see functionality such as:  var result = str.replace    g,'&gt;' ;  Libraries such as jQuery also make extensive use of method chaining:  $ document .ready function   {    $ "orderedlist" .find "li" .each function i  {      $ this .append  " BAM! " + i  ;    } ;  } ;  If you examine the development version of jQuery  which is uncompressed and very readable , you’ll see return this sprinkled all throughout the library’s methods:     Force the current matched set of elements to become    the specified array of elements     destroying the stack in the process     You should use pushStack   in order to do this,    but maintain the stack  setArray: function  elems   {       Resetting the length to 0, then using the native Array push       is a super-fast way to populate an object with       array-like properties    this.length = 0;    push.apply  this, elems  ;     return this;    }, See Also Chapter 17 provides an introduction to using jQuery in your JavaScript applications.  16.13  Chaining Your Object’s Methods   387    CHAPTER 17 JavaScript Libraries  17.0  Introduction JavaScript developers have never been luckier. Today, there are several very fine Java- Script framework libraries we can use for our applications that take care of many of the more tedious aspects of JavaScript development. In fact, you might be thinking about why you would even need a book on just plain JavaScript, when you can use framework libraries like Dojo, Ample SDK, Prototype, or jQuery  which I’m featuring later in this chapter . Why put up with the hassle of cross-browser issues, or the minutiae of creating and instantiating XMLHttpRequest object directly just to make a simple Ajax call? I could reply that in order to use a framework library like jQuery to its best ability, you need to understand what’s happening under the hood. This is a valid answer, because if you don’t know what you can do with JavaScript, you won’t know what you can do with a JavaScript framework library. However, I have another, more philosophical reason why you need to understand the basics of JavaScript, inspired in part by a short story by one of my favorite science fiction writers, Isaac Asimov. Isaac Asimov wrote a story, “The Feeling of Power,” in the 1950s. In the story, a simple technician named Myron Aub astounds military, political, and scientific leaders with his astonishing discovery: the ability to perform mathematical calculations using only a person’s own mental ability, and a piece of paper and pencil. In the future time in which Aub lives, people had become dependent on machines to do all of their calculations; they had forgotten how to perform even the most basic math. Asimov was inspired to write the story out of his growing concern about our increasing mechanistic dependencies. When you consider that high schools no longer teach basic mathematical procedures, such as how to compute a logarithm manually, because of our use of calculators and computers, Asimov demonstrated remarkable prescience with his story.  389   Now, I don’t think we’re in danger of forgetting how to code JavaScript from scratch, or how to build our own libraries—at least, not in the near future. But why let the framework library builders have all the fun with the language?

Another lightweight framework is MooTools.  17.1  Packaging Your Code Problem You want to package your code into one or more JavaScript files. Solution If your code is in one big file, look for opportunities to extract reusable functionality into self-contained objects in a separate library. If you find you have a set of functions you repeat in all of your applications, consider packaging them for reuse via an object literal. Transform the following:  function getElem identifier  {    return document.getElementById identifier ; }  function stripslashes  str  {       return str.replace  \\ g, '' ; }  function removeAngleBrackets str  {       return str.replace    g,'&gt;' ; }  to:  var jscbObject = {        return element    getElem : function  identifier  {       return document.getElementById identifier ;    },     stripslashes : function str  {       return str.replace  \\ g, '' ;    },     removeAngleBrackets: function str  {  390  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries         return str.replace    g,'&gt;' ;    } };  Discussion In the solution, I’ve taken three functions in the global space and converted them into three methods on one object. Not only does this reduce the clutter in the global space, but it helps prevent clashes with similar-sounding function names in other libraries. Even as functions, though, they’re a step up from code that’s hardcoded to a specific use. For instance, if your code has the following to access a style property from an element:     get width var style; var elem = div.getElementById "elem" ; if  elem.currentStyle  {    style = elem.currentStyle["width"]; } else if  document.defaultView && document.defaultView.getComputedStyle  {    style = document.defaultView.getComputedStyle elem,null . getPropertyValue "width" ; }  Repeating this code in more than one function in your application can quickly bloat the size of the JavaScript, as well as make it harder to read. Modularize the code by extracting it into a reusable function, and eventually into a new member of your library object literal:  var BBObjLibrary = {        get stylesheet style    getStyle : function  obj, styleName  {       if  obj.currentStyle           return obj.currentStyle[styleName];       else if  document.defaultView && document.defaultView.getComputedStyle           return document.defaultView.getComputedStyle obj,null . getPropertyValue styleName ;       return undefined;    }, ... }  Even when you split your code into libraries of reusable objects, look for an opportunity to modularize your code into layers of functionality. I have one library, bb.js, that provides basic functionality such as event handling, ac- cessing generic style elements, processing keyboard events, and so on. I have another library, mtwimg.js, I use to provide image handling in a web page, similar to what the popular library Lightbox 2 provides. The latter is built up on top of the former, so that  17.1  Packaging Your Code  391   I don’t have to repeat the functionality in both libraries, but I also keep my bb.js library small, and focused. When I created a third library, accordion.js, which creates automatic accordion widgets  also sometimes called collapsible sections , it was also built on the bb.js generic library, considerably reducing the development time. More importantly, if I eventually decide to drop support for my generic library in favor of another externally developed library, such as Dojo, Prototype, or jQuery, though the internal functionality in accordion.js and mtwimg.js has to change, the web pages that use both don’t, because the latter two libraries’ outward-facing functionality isn’t affected. This is a concept known as refac- toring:  improving  the  efficiency  of  your  code  without  affecting  the  external functionality. Oh, and while you’re at it: document your code. Though you may provide a minified version  of  your  code  for  production  use,  consider  providing  a  nonminified,  well- documented version of your JavaScript libraries so that others can learn from your code, the same as you’re able to learn from theirs. See Also Recipe 17.3 covers how to minify your JavaScript. Object literals are covered in Rec- ipe 16.11. You can download Lightbox 2 at http:  www.huddletogether.com projects  lightbox2 . Creating accordion sections is covered in Recipe 13.6.  17.2  Testing Your Code with JsUnit Problem You followed the good structuring practices outlined in Recipe 17.1 to create your JavaScript objects. Now you want to thoroughly test your code before packaging it into a library for distribution. Solution Use a tool like JsUnit to create test cases to formally test your library. If your library contains an object method like the following:  function addAndRound value1,value2  {     return Math.round value1 + value2 ; }  JsUnit test cases could look like the following:  function testAddAndRound   {     assertEquals "checking valid", 6, addAndRound 3.55, 2.33  ;     assertNaN "checking NaN",addAndRound "three", "Four and a quarter"  ; }  392  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Both tests would be successful: the first because the result of the function is equal to the value 6, and both results are numbers; the second because the result of the function call is NaN, which is what the test checks. Discussion Chapter 10 covered error handling and debugging using a variety of tools, depending on your preferred development browser. Now, you’re ready to create more formal tests, not only for your own use, but for others. These types of tests are called unit tests. A good rule of thumb when it comes to unit testing is that every requirement or use case for a library function  or object method  should have an associated test case  or cases . The unit test checks that the requirement is met, and the library function per- forms as expected. You can develop your own tests, but using something like JsUnit simplifies the test writing.  The version of JsUnit I use is a JavaScript implementation of the well- known JUnit testing software, and was developed by Edward Hieatt. JsUnit can be downloaded at http:  www.jsunit.net , which also includes links for documentation and examples.  Once you’ve downloaded, unzipped, and installed the JsUnit folder, preferably in a test folder for your own application, create several test application pages to test your li- brary’s functionality. Each page will contain a link to the JsUnit engine and your library. If the JsUnit library is located in its folder direction in your development subdirectory, link it as follows:         Use the JsUnit methods in script in the page to perform the tests, and the JsUnit web page, testRunner.html, to actually run the test. How the test functions are written are based on JUnit testing methodology: the function names begin with test and can have no parameters. The JsUnit assertions used to write tests are:  assert  [comment],booleanValue   Tests that a function returns a Boolean value.  assertTrue [comment],booleanValue   Tests for true return.  assertFalse [comment], booleanValue   Tests for false return.  assertEquals [comment], value1, value2   Tests return result or variable for equality.  17.2  Testing Your Code with JsUnit   393   assertsNotEquals  [comment],value1,value2   Tests return result or variable against another value for nonequality.  assertNull [comment],value   Tests for null value or return. assertNotNull [comment],value   Tests for nonnull value or return.  The first parameter in the functions—the comment—is optional. However, it does make it much easier to determine which test fails if you can see a unique comment for the test. JsUnit supports other functions, such as setUp and tearDown, called before the tests are started and after they have finished, respectively. There are also three functions, which provide trace messages:  warn message,[value]   Warning message, with optional value  inform message,[value]   Information message, with optional value  debug message,[value]   Debugging information, with optional value  Once you’ve created your test page, you run the tests within the testRunner.html page. If some of the tests fail, errors will display under the test progress bar. If you double- click the test, you can get the test fail information, as shown in Figure 17-1. To see the JsUnit functionality in action, Example 17-1 contains a simple object with three methods.  Example 17-1. Simple JavaScript object with methods  var BBTest = {   concatWithSpace : function string1, string2  {     return string1 + " " + string2;   },   discoverNumber : function string, number  {     return string.indexOf number ;   },   divideNumbers : function  value1, value2  {     return value1   value2;   },   addAndRound : function value1, value2  {     return Math.round value1 + value2 ;   } }  Example 17-2 is a JsUnit test page that tests the object methods.  394  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Figure 17-1. A JsUnit test run with some failed tests  Example 17-2. JsUnit Test page to test methods for object in Example 17-1       Testing Library           function testConcatWithSpace   {   inform "Testing concatWithSpace" ;   assertEquals "Checking equality", "Shelley Powers",BBTest.concatWithSpace "Shelley","Powers"  ; }  function testDiscoverNumber   {   inform "Testing discoverNumber" ;   assertEquals "Checking valid params",5, BBTest.discoverNumber "found5value",5  ; }  function testDivideNumbers   {   inform "Testing divideNumbers" ;   assertNaN "Checking numeric ops with no numbers", BBTest.divideNumbers "five","2"  ;   assertNotEquals "Checking not equals","5", BBTest.divideNumbers 10,2  ;  17.2  Testing Your Code with JsUnit   395   }     function testAddAndRound   {   inform "Testing addAndRound" ;   assertNaN "Checking NaN",BBTest.addAndRound "four", "Three Quarter"  ;   assertEquals "Checking correct values",6, BBTest.addAndRound 2.33,3.45  ; }       Running tests of test.js. View source to see tests.     Load the test page into the testRunner.html page, located within the jsUnit subdirectory. All of the tests are successful, as shown in Figure 17-2.  Figure 17-2. Successful run of test page in Example 17-2  JsUnit can be managed manually, or can be integrated into an automated testing en- vironment, including integration with Apache Ant.  396  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   17.3  Minify Your Library Problem You want to compactly package your code for wider distribution. Solution After you’ve optimized your library code and tested it thoroughly through unit testing, compress it with a JavaScript optimizer. Discussion Once you’ve created your library, optimized it for efficiency, and run it through your unit testing, you’re ready to prep your code for production use. One preparation to make is to compress the JavaScript as much as possible, so the file is small and loads quickly. JavaScript compression is handled through minify applica- tions you can find online, such as the well-known JavaScript Compressor, created by Dean Edwards, shown in Figure 17-3.  See Also You can find JavaScript minifiers and compressors all over the Web by searching for “compress JavaScript” or “JavaScript minify”. Dean Edwards’s JavaScript compression tool can be found at http:  javascriptcompressor.com .  17.4  Hosting Your Library Problem You want to open source your code, but you don’t want to have to maintain the libraries on your own server. Solution Use one of the source code hosts to host your code, and provide the tools to manage collaboration with other developers. Discussion One of the beautiful things about JavaScript is that many of the libraries and applica- tions are open source, which means that not only are they typically free to use, but you can also adapt the library with your innovations, or even collaborate on the original. I strongly encourage open sourcing your libraries as much as possible. However, unless  17.4  Hosting Your Library  397   Figure 17-3. Result of compressing the code from Example 17-1  you have the resources to mount a public-facing source code control system, you’ll want to use one of the sites that provide support for open source applications. One source code host is Google Code, which contains a simple user interface to start a new project and upload code. You can choose between two version control software systems  Subversion and Mercurial , as well as one of a host of open source licenses. There is a wiki component to each project where you can provide documentation, and a way to provide updates for those interested in the project. The site also provides issue- tracking software for people to file bugs, in addition to a Downloads link and a separate link for source code. The SVG-enabling software SVGWeb, mentioned in Chapter 15, is hosted in Google Code.  Figure  17-4  shows  the  front  page  for  the  project  and  the  links  to  all  of  the secondary support pages, including the Wiki, Downloads, Issues, Source, and so on. There is no charge for hosting an application on Google Code.  398  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Another increasingly popular host for open source projects is github. Unlike Google Code, there are limits to what is supported for a free account on the service, but Java- Script libraries should not tax these limits. You shouldn’t be faced with costs, as long as your projects are open source and publicly available. However, if you want to use the service for a private collaboration with several others, this service is available at a cost.  Figure 17-4. SVGWeb hosted at Google Code  As with Google Code, github supports source code control and collaboration from several people, including records of issues, downloads, a wiki support page, and a nice graphs page that provides graphics of language support, usage, and other interesting indicators. The very popular jQuery library is hosted on github, as shown in Figure 17-5, though you download jQuery from its own domain.  17.4  Hosting Your Library  399   Figure 17-5. The github page for the jQuery library  Source Forge used to be the place to host your open source software in the past. However, the site blocks access to certain countries listed in the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list, and has fallen out of favor with many open source developers.  17.5  Using an External Library: Building on the jQuery Framework Problem You want to create application-specific libraries without having to create your own library of reusable routines. Solution Use one of the framework JavaScript libraries, such as Prototype, Dojo, or jQuery, in order to provide the basic functionality you need, but isolate the use so that you can swap frameworks if needed.  400  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Discussion There are good reasons—aside from the time saved—for using an existing JavaScript framework library such as jQuery. One is that the code is more robustly tested by several people. Another is that you can tap into a community of support when you run into problems in your applications. I’m focusing primarily on jQuery because it is the library incorporated into most of the applications I use, including Drupal, the Content Management System  CMS  I use at my site. It’s also small, specific, modular, and relatively uncomplicated. However, li- braries such as Prototype, Dojo, Mootools, and others are also good, and you should examine each before making a decision.  Download jQuery from http:  jquery.com . You can access both a mini- fied version of the library and an uncompressed developer version.  To use jQuery, include a link to the library before providing links to your own or other, secondary libraries:      There are several application-specific libraries that are dependent on jQuery, so you may want to check if they provide jQuery as part of their own installation. One aspect of jQuery that differs from most of the examples in this book is that jQuery’s “starting” point for script is not  window.onload, as I’ve used with most of the code samples. Instead, the jQuery library provides a page start routine that waits for DOM elements to be loaded, but does not wait for images or other media to finish loading. This beginning point is called the ready event, and looks like the following:  $ document .ready function   {  ... } ;  The code snippet demonstrates a couple of other things about jQuery. First, notice the dollar sign element reference: $ document . In jQuery, the dollar sign  $  is a reference to the main jQuery class, and acts as a selector for all element access in the application. If  you’re  working  with  jQuery,  use  the  jQuery  selector  rather  than  code  your  own element access, because the jQuery selector comes with prepackaged functionality es- sential for jQuery to operate successfully. The syntax you use when querying for page elements is the same as the syntax for the querySelector and querySelectorAll methods, described in Chapter 11. It’s based on CSS selector syntax for accessing a named element, such as the following:  divOne{   color: red; }  17.5  Using an External Library: Building on the jQuery Framework  401   Using jQuery to access this element looks like this:  $ "divOne" .click function   {    alert "Well Hi World!" ; } ;  This code snippet returns a reference to the div element identified by divOne, and then attaches a function to the element’s onclick event handler that prints out a message. The code also demonstrates another fundamental aspect of jQuery—it makes heavy use of method chaining. Method chaining is a way of appending methods one to another. In the code, rather than return a reference to the div element and then attach the event handler function to it, you attach the event handler directly to the element request. There is extensive documentation and tutorials on using jQuery, so I’ll leave an in- depth overview of jQuery for an off-book exercise. However, I did want to cover one important  aspect  of  using  jQuery—or  any  framework  library  with  your  own applications. The key to making these work now and in the future is to wrap the library use in such a way that you can swap one library out for another, without having to recode your applications—or, at least, minimize the amount of recoding you would have to do. Rather than use the jQuery ready event, create your own so you don’t build a higher- level dependency on jQuery. Rather than use jQuery methods directly in your business logic, use your own objects and methods, and call the jQuery methods within these. By providing a layer of abstraction between the implementation of your application’s business logic and the external framework library, if someday you stumble upon Frew, the Wonder Library, you can swap out jQuery  or Prototype, or Dojo  and build on Frew. See Also jQuery Cookbook by Cody Lindley  O’Reilly  is an excellent book providing a com- prehensive overview and detailed how-tos for jQuery. It’s what I’m using to come up to speed on this powerful little library, and provides the best coverage on writing jQuery plug-ins  see Recipe 17.7 . See  Recipe  11.4  for  the  use  of  the  Selectors  API  and  selector  syntax.  And  see  Rec- ipe 16.13 for more on object method chaining.  17.6  Using Existing jQuery Plug-ins Problem You’ve made the decision to use jQuery as a framework. Now you want to incorporate some jQuery plug-ins and ensure they don’t clash with your object libraries.  402  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Solution When you’ve found the plug-in s  you want to use, check the documentation for all methods and properties, not just those you’re interested in. Make sure that there isn’t anything in the plug-in that can generate unwanted side effects when used in conjunc- tion with your own application. Focus on using plug-ins that provide exactly what you need, and only what you need. Try to avoid over-generic plug-ins. Also make sure there aren’t name clashes between the external plug-in and any you’ve created yourself. As an example of a single-purpose, tightly focused plug-in, the jQuery Validation plug- in’s only purpose is to validate form field data. It can validate for Zip code, email ad- dress, even credit card format. To use, annotate your form fields with specific classes, such as required for required fields, or email to validate the field as email. An example is the following, from the jQuery plug-in site:           A simple comment form with submit validation and default messages             Name        * <input id="cname" name="name" size="25" class="required" minlength="2"  >                 E-Mail        * <input id="cemail" name="email" size="25" class="required email"  >                 URL           <input id="curl" name="url" size="25"  class="url" value=""  >                 Your comment        * <textarea id="ccomment" name="comment" cols="22" class="required">                               Then, in your script, make one function call:  j$ "commentForm" .validate  ;  It doesn’t get simpler than that.  17.6  Using Existing jQuery Plug-ins   403   Discussion The plug-in in the solution, jQuery Validation, provides a small set of methods and several events that you can capture in order to perform any additional validation. You can  also  provide  custom  configuration  for  all  displayed  messages.  Single-purpose, tightly focused plug-ins with few methods that provide events that you can intercept and customize for appearance should integrate well with your application. Once integrated, though, you’ll also need to incorporate unit tests for the plug-in, in addition to your own functions. You’ll also have to check for updates to the plug-ins, and be aware of any issues and bugs. In particular, look for updates or potential prob- lems with new releases of jQuery.  The  Validation  plug-in  can  be  downloaded  at  http:  docs.jquery.com  Plugins Validation.  Look  for  jQuery  plug-ins  at  http:  plugins.jquery .com .  17.7  Convert Your Library to a jQuery Plug-in Problem You want to convert your library methods and functions into a jQuery plug-in for use by others. Solution If you want your method to participate in the jQuery chain and be used with selectors, assign your method to the jQuery.fn property:  jQuery.fn.increaseWidth = function   {    return this.each function   {       var width = $ this .width   + 10;       $ this .width width ;    } ; };  jQuery.bbHelloWorld = function who  {    alert  "Hello " + who + "!" ; };  If your plug-in has one or more separate functions that do not need to participate in the jQuery chain, or be attached to a selector, create a jQuery function directly on the jQuery object:  If your function uses the jQuery dollar sign function  $  and you’re concerned that the library could be used with other libraries that make use of $, wrap your function in an anonymous function. Instead of using the following jQuery method approach:  404  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   jQuery.fn.flashBlueRed = function   {     return this.each function   {       var hex = rgb2hex $ this .css "background-color"  ;       if  hex == "0000ff"  {         $ this .css "background-color", "ff0000" ;       } else {         $ this .css "background-color", "0000ff" ;       }     } ;  };  use the following anonymous function syntax:  ; function $  {    $.fn.flashBlueRed = function   {       return this.each function   {          var hex = rgb2hex $ this .css "background-color"  ;          if  hex == "0000ff"  {             $ this .css "background-color", "ff0000" ;          } else {             $ this .css "background-color", "0000ff" ;          }        } ;     }; }  jQuery ;  Discussion It’s relatively simple to create a jQuery plug-in once you understand the nuances of the jQuery plug-in infrastructure. If you’re interested in creating a jQuery method that can be used with a jQuery selector and participate in the jQuery chain, you’ll use the first syntax shown in the solution:  jQuery.fn.increaseWidth = function   {    return this.each function   {       var width = $ this .width   + 10;       $ this .width width ;    } ; };  However, if you want to make use of the dollar sign function  $  within the code, but still have the plug-in work within a multiple library setting, wrap the method in an anonymous function:  ; function $  {    $.fn.flashBlueRed = function   {       return this.each function   {          var hex = rgb2hex $ this .css "background-color"  ;          if  hex == "0000ff"  {             $ this .css "background-color", "ff0000" ;          } else {             $ this .css "background-color", "0000ff" ;          }        } ;  17.7  Convert Your Library to a jQuery Plug-in  405       }; }  jQuery ;  Notice the following line in both examples:  return this.each function    {  This code is necessary to allow the method to work on whatever is returned by the selector, regardless of whether it’s a single item or a group of items. The line begins the code block that includes your actual method code. Check  out  the  semi-colon   ;   just  before  the  anonymous  function.  I  picked  this trick up from Cody Lindley in jQuery Cookbook  O’Reilly . Putting the semicolon be- fore the anonymous function ensures that the function won’t break if another plug-in forgets to terminate a method or function with a semi-colon. If you’re only interested in adding a jQuery function that isn’t part of the jQuery chain or which makes use of a selector, use the jQuery function syntax:  jQuery.bbHelloWorld = function who  {    alert  "Hello " + who + "!" ; };  Once you have created your plug-in code, package it in a separate file; to use the code, all someone has to do is include the script, following the jQuery script. An example of a plug-in file is shown in Example 17-3. This file has a couple of func- tions, specific to converting an RGB value to a hexadecimal. All of the functions are added to the jQuery object, and each is preceded by “bb”, to act as namespace for the function. The bbGetRGB function in the library is actually a function that exists as an internal  not publicly exposed  function within the jQuery User Interface  UI  library. It was origi- nally created by Blair Mitchelmore for the highlightFade jQuery plug-in. However, I didn’t want to include the jQuery UI, so I just borrowed the function for the example.  Example 17-3. A jQuery plug-in     Parse strings looking for color tuples [255,255,255]    pulled from internal jQuery function jQuery.bbGetRGB = function color  {     var result;         Check if we're already dealing with an array of colors     if   color && color.constructor == Array && color.length == 3           return color;         Look for rgb num,num,num      if  result =  rgb\ \s* [0-9]{1,3} \s*,\s* [0-9]{1,3} \s*,\s* [0- 9]{1,3} \s*\  .exec color            return [parseInt result[1],10 , parseInt result[2],10 , parseInt result[3],10 ];         Look for rgb num%,num%,num%   406  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries       if  result =  rgb\ \s* [0-9]+ ?:\.[0-9]+ ? \%\s*,\s* [0-9]+ ?:\. [0-9]+ ? \%\s*,\s* [0-9]+ ?:\.[0-9]+ ? \%\s*\  .exec color            return [parseFloat result[1] *2.55, parseFloat result[2] * 2.55, parseFloat result[3] *2.55];         Look for a0b1c2     if  result =   [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  [a-fA-F0-9]{2}  . exec color            return [parseInt result[1],16 , parseInt result[2],16 , parseInt result[3],16 ];         Look for fff     if  result =   [a-fA-F0-9]  [a-fA-F0-9]  [a-fA-F0-9]  . exec color           return [parseInt result[1]+result[1],16 , parseInt result[2]+result[2],16 , parseInt result[3]+result[3],16 ];         Look for rgba 0, 0, 0, 0  == transparent in Safari 3     if  result =  rgba\ 0, 0, 0, 0\  .exec color           return colors['transparent'];         Otherwise, we're most likely dealing with a named color         return colors[$.trim color .toLowerCase  ]; };  jQuery.bbPadHex = function  value  {     if  value.toString  .length == 1  {          value = "0" + value;      }      return value; };  jQuery.bbConvertRGBtoHex = function rgbString  {      var colors = $.bbGetRGB rgbString ;      var red = $.bbPadHex parseInt colors[0] .toString 16  ;      var green = $.bbPadHex parseInt colors[1] .toString 16  ;      var blue = $.bbPadHex parseInt colors[2] .toString 16  ;       return "" + red + green + blue; };  bbPadHex,  bbConvertRGBtoHex,  and  bbGetRGB  are  added  as  jQuery  functions,  the flashBlueRed method is wrapped in an anonymous function, and the increaseWidth method is a straight jQuery method. Example 17-4 shows the two methods in action. Notice how the increaseWidth method is chained to the flashBlueRed method, and both work on the element returned with the jQuery selector.  17.7  Convert Your Library to a jQuery Plug-in  407   Example 17-4. Web page and application that use the new plug-in                test   {     background-color: 0000ff;     width: 500px;     padding: 10px;     color: ffffff;     font-weight: bold;     font-size: larger;   }                                  $ document .ready function   {          $ "test" .click function   {              $ this .flashBlueRed  .increaseWidth  ;          } ;        } ;                       hi, click me to change color            17.8  Safely Combining Several Libraries in Your Applications Problem You want to incorporate more than one external library, as well as your own, into one application without each stepping all over the others. Solution The safest approach for using multiple libraries is to pick ones that are all based on the same framework, such as using only libraries based on Dojo, Prototype, or jQuery, the framework used in earlier recipes. If that strategy doesn’t work, make sure the libraries all use good programming prac- tices, and none are overriding functionality or event handling provided by the others.  408  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries   Discussion Regardless of library purpose, there are fundamental rules governing the behavior of libraries that must be followed. Well-designed libraries do not do things like this:  window.onload=function   {...}  I use the DOM Level 0 window.onload event handler with the examples in the book because it’s quick, simple, and doesn’t add a lot of code to the sample. However, if you have one library that uses the old DOM Level 0 event handling, it will overwrite the event capturing utilized by the other libraries and your own application. Well-designed libraries don’t use DOM Level 0 event handling. Well-designed libraries also name- space all of their functionality. You won’t find the following in a well-defined library:  Each function like this ends up in the global space, which increases the likelihood of clashes with other libraries, and your own applications. Well-designed libraries use object literals to namespace their functionality:  function foo   { ... } function bar   { ... }  var BigObject = {    foo : function    { },    bar : function    { } }  A library that plays well with other libraries and applications will not extend existing objects via the prototype object. Yes, I know it’s a wonderful way of extending objects, and fundamental to JavaScript, but you can’t control one library from overriding an- other if both are extending the prototype property for the same object. Besides, if the framework and external libraries you use don’t extend existing objects via the object’s prototype, this leaves you free to play in your application. Come to that, library builders should never assume that their library is the only one used in a project. Well-designed libraries provide event hooks so that you can hook into the library at the points where it performs a major action. In Recipe 17.7, the jQuery plug-in descri- bed in the solution provided event handler hooks you can use to provide your own functionality before or after the plug-in’s validation routine. Well-designed libraries provide good documentation of all of the publicly exposed bits, including methods, properties, and events. You shouldn’t have to guess how to use the library, or examine minute portions of the code, in order to figure out what you need to do. Well-designed  libraries  are  well-tested,  and  provide  a  way  to  report  bugs  and  view existing bugs. If there’s a major security problem with an existing library, you need to know about it. If there are minor bugs, you need to know about these, too. Libraries that provide a subdirectory with self-tests rate high in my book.  17.8  Safely Combining Several Libraries in Your Applications   409   Well-designed  libraries  provide  nonminified,  original  source  code.  This  isn’t essential—just helpful, and something I look for in a library. It goes without saying that a good library is one actively maintained, but it can’t hurt to repeat this assertion. An even better library is one that’s open sourced, and main- tained by a community of users—or is one you can maintain on your own, if the original maintainer can no longer perform this action. To summarize:    A good library does not use DOM Level 0 event handling.   A well-defined library uses object literals to namespace its functionality.   A well-defined library introduces few global objects.   Libraries that play well with others provide event hooks. Well-behaved libraries  also don’t extend existing objects via the prototype property.    Solid libraries are well-tested, and hopefully provide these self-tests as deliverables.   Stable libraries are actively maintained and, preferably, open sourced.   Secure libraries provide documentation of known bugs and problems, and a way  to report on any bugs and problems you find.    Usable libraries are well-documented. Bandwidth-friendly libraries are optimized  and compressed, though you can always compress the library yourself    Confident libraries aren’t built on the assumption that no other library will be used.  For the most part, you should be able to find what you need and have it work with your preferred framework. Be cautious when it comes to using a library that requires you add a new framework, which then needs to coexist with another framework. However, most well-built framework libraries could work with others. As an example of framework coexistence, and since I’m focusing on jQuery in this chapter, if you use jQuery, you can use another framework library, such as Prototype, MooTools, or Dojo. The use of global namespaces should prevent name clashes. The only exception to the namespace rule is the dollar sign  $ , function, which is also used by Prototype. You can override the use of the $ by adding the following, after all the libraries have been loaded:  jQuery.noConflict  ;  Once you add this code, instead of:  $ "elem" .fadeOut 'slow' ;  use:  jQuery "elem" .fadeOut 'slow' ;  410  Chapter 17: JavaScript Libraries  There are other approaches, too, including assigning a new short character replace- ment, but these are detailed in the jQuery documentation.   You can use most well-made framework libraries together, but there is tremendous overlap in functionality between the libraries, and this overlap in functionality comes with a cost: bandwidth to download the libraries. Try to avoid using more than one framework library at a time. Find the one you like, and be prepared to commit to it for some time to come. See Also The jQuery web page documenting how to use the framework with other libraries is at http:  docs.jquery.com Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries.  17.8  Safely Combining Several Libraries in Your Applications   411    CHAPTER 18 Communication  18.0  Introduction This book has explored a lot of subjects, but the functionality that revolutionized web client development is  arguably  Ajax. With Ajax, we’re no longer dependent on the slow, cumbersome round-trips and associated page load times that plagued early web- sites. Now we can make an Ajax call, get some data, update the page—sometimes without the user even being aware that the activity is happening. Ajax is also a relatively uncomplicated functionality, at least compared to other Java- Script functionality I’ve covered in the book. The main steps to an Ajax application are:    Prepare the server-side API call.   Make the call.   Process the result.  Of course, there are interesting challenges that can occur at any time during these three steps, but for a basic application, it really is just that simple. Ajax is now joined by a new communication kid: the postMessage. This new function- ality originated with HTML5, though it has since split off to its own specification. It’s an uncomplicated functionality that allows for easy communication between a parent and child window, even if the child window is located in another domain.  There are two other new communication APIs in work: Cross Origin Resource Sharing  CORS  and the Web Sockets API. Both are being developed in the W3C, and both are currently in Working Draft state: CORS  at  http:  www.w3.org TR access-control   and  Web  Sockets  at http:  dev.w3.org html5 websockets .  CORS is a way of doing cross-domain Ajax calls, and is currently im- plemented in Firefox 3.5 and up, and Safari 4.x and up. The Web Sock- ets API is a bidirectional communication mechanism, implemented only in Chrome at this time.  413   18.1  Accessing the XMLHttpRequest Object Problem You want to access an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object. Solution If you’re not concerned about support for IE6, you can use the following:  var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  This works with all of the target browsers for this book, and is the only method I used in examples in the book. However, if you must still support IE6 and you’re not using one of the JavaScript libraries, you’ll need to use the following cross-browser code:  if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {    xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ; } else if  window.ActiveXObject  {    xmlHttp = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ; }  Discussion Microsoft  invented  the  XMLHttpRequest  object  as  an  ActiveX  object.  However,  the XMLHttpRequest object that we know and primarily use today, even in newer versions of IE, evolved independently. There’s now an effort underway to standardize the object within the W3C. The XMLHttpRequest object isn’t very complicated. Here are the supported client appli- cation methods, which are explored in more depth in the other recipes in this chapter:  open  Initializes a request. Parameters include the method  GET or POST , the request URL, whether the request is asynchronous, and a possible username and password. By default, all requests are sent asynchronously.  setRequestHeader  Sets the MIME type of the request.  send  Sends the request.  sendAsBinary  Sends binary data.  abort  Aborts an already sent request.  getResponseHeader  414  Chapter 18: Communication  Retrieves the header text, or null if the response hasn’t been returned yet or there is no header.   getAllResponseHeaders  Retrieves the header text for a multipart request.  All of our target browsers support the methods just listed. There’s also an additional, frequently used method, overrideMimeType, not included in the list. I didn’t include it because it’s not part of the XMLHttpRequest standardization process, and one browser company doesn’t support it  Microsoft . The overrideMimeType method is normally used to override the MIME type of the server response., As an example, the following overrides whatever the server’s response is, and the returned resource is treated as XML:  xmlhttp.overrideMimeType 'text xml' ;  Lack of support for overrideMimeType is an inconvenience but not a showstopper. Either we’ll need to process the data according to MIME type or ensure that our server ap- plications set the proper content header for the data. For instance, if we want to ensure that our client application receives data as XML, we can use the following in a PHP application:  header "Content-Type: text xml; charset=utf-8" ;  There are also a number of properties supported by all browsers:  status  statusText  readyState  responseText  responseXML  The HTTP result status of the request response.  The response text returned from the server.  The state of the request.  The text-based response to the request.  The response to the request as an XML-based DOM object.  There are other properties, some proprietary and some not, but these are the ones we’re concerned with in this book. A major restriction associated with the XMLHttpRequest object is the same-origin security restriction. This means that you can’t use XMLHttpRequest to make a service request to an API in another domain. See Also Recipe 18.7 provides a solution and a discussion related to the same-origin restriction with XMLHttpRequest. The W3C XMLHttpRequest draft specification can be found at http:   www.w3.org TR XMLHttpRequest .  18.1  Accessing the XMLHttpRequest Object   415   18.2  Preparing the Data for Transmission Problem You want to process form data for an Ajax call rather than send the data via the usual form submit process. Solution Access the data from form fields or other page elements:  var state = document.getElementById "state" .value;  If the data is user-supplied, such as the data from a text field, encode the result using the encodeURIComponent function, so any characters in the text that could impact on the Ajax call are escaped:  var state = encodeURIComponent document.getElementById "state" .value ;  You shouldn’t need to escape data from radio buttons, checkboxes, selections, or any other form element in which your application controls the data, as you can make sure those values are in the proper format. Discussion Depending on the type of action, data for an Ajax call can come from user-supplied text, such as that typed into a text field. When it is, you’ll need to ensure that the data can be used in the Ajax request by escaping certain characters, such as an ampersand  & , plus sign  + , and equal sign  = . The following string:  This is $value3 @value &and ** ++ another  Is encoded as:  This%20is%20%24value3%20%40value%20%26and%20**%20%2B%2B%20another  The spaces are escaped as %20, the dollar sign as %24, the ampersand as %26, and the plus sign as %2B, but the alphanumeric characters and the reserved asterisk characters are left alone. Once escaped, the data can be attached as part of an Ajax request. If the Ajax request is going to be a POST rather than a GET request, further encoding is needed—the spaces  should  be  encoded  as  pluses.  Replace  the  %20  with  +,  following  the  call  to  encodeURIComponent. You can package this functionality for reuse:  function postEncodeURIComponent str  {    str=encodeURIComponent str ;    return str.replace  %20 g,"+" ; }  416  Chapter 18: Communication   The escaping ensures that the Ajax request will be successfully communicated, but it doesn’t ensure that the Ajax request is safe. All data input by unknown persons should always  be  scrubbed  to  prevent  SQL  injection  or  cross-site  scripting   XSS   attacks. However, this type of security should be implemented in the server-side application, because if people can put together a GET request in JavaScript, they can put together a GET request directly in a browser’s location bar and bypass the script altogether. The only time you need to scrub the input in JavaScript is if you’re planning on embedding a user’s data directly back into the page.  18.3  Determining the Type of Query Call Problem You’re not sure whether to send your Ajax call as a GET or a POST. Solution For an update, send a POST request. Set the first parameter in the XMLHttpRequest open method to POST, call the setRequestHeader to set the content-type, and send the request parameters in the send method: xmlhttp.open 'POST',url,true ; xmlhttp.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "application x-www-form-urlencoded" ; xmlhttp.send param ;  For a query, send a GET request. The first parameter in the XMLHttpRequest open meth- od is set to GET, the parameters are appended on to the URL for the request, and null is passed as parameter in the send method:  url = url + "?" + param; xmlhttp.open 'GET',url,true ; xmlhttp.send null ;  Discussion What the server component of the application is expecting has the most impact on your request type decision. However, accepted practice is that a request for data should be made with a GET, while an update should occur through a POST. The request type practice used in Ajax is derived from RESTful guidelines  REST trans- lates as REpresentational State Transfer . According to the guidelines, there are four types of HTTP requests:  GET  POST  Used for retrieving information, with parameters attached to the URL.  Used for creating new data, and parameters are sent via function parameter.  18.3  Determining the Type of Query Call   417   DELETE  PUT  Used for deleting data records, and parameters are sent via function parameter.  Used to send an update, and parameters are sent via function parameter.  There is broad support only for the GET and POST requests at this time, so I’ll focus on these two. A GET HTTP request is used to retrieve information, and the parameters are attached to the URL in the request. A function that processes a GET request could look like the following, which passes two parameters with the request:       get input data   var one = encodeURIComponent document.getElementById "one" .value ;   var two = encodeURIComponent document.getElementById "two" .value ;   var params = "one=" + one + "&two=" + two;  function sendData evt  {       cancel default form submittal   evt = evt  window.event;   evt.preventDefault  ;   evt.returnValue = false;       prep request   if  !http  {      http = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   }   var url = "ajaxserver.php?" + params;   http.open "GET", url, true        callback function   http.onreadystatechange=processResult;       make Ajax call with params   http.send null ; }  In the code snippet, two parameters are passed with the request. First, they’re escaped, using  encodeURIComponent.  Next,  they’re  attached  to  the  URL  using  RESTful  GET notation:  http:  somecompany.com?param=value&param2=value2  The parameters for the XMLHttpRequest open method are:  GET  url  true  A GET request  The URL for the service  418  Chapter 18: Communication  Whether the operation is performed asynchronously   The optional third asynchronous parameter should always be set to true, or the page blocks until the server request returns. This is not a cool thing to do to your page readers. There  are  two  other  optional  parameters  not  shown:  username  and  password.  If  the application is protected on the server side, the username and password can be used for authentication. A POST request with two parameters would look like the following:  function sendData evt  {       cancel default form submittal   evt = evt  window.event;   evt.preventDefault  ;   evt.returnValue = false;       get input data   var one = encodeURIComponent document.getElementById "one" .value .   replace  %20 g,'+' ;   var two = encodeURIComponent document.getElementById "two" .value .   replace  %20 g,'+' ;   var params = "one=" + one + "&two=" + two;       prep request   if  !http  {      http = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   }   var url = "ajaxserver.php";   http.open "POST", url, true        set up Ajax headers   http.setRequestHeader "Content-Type",   "application x-www-form-urlencoded" ;   http.setRequestHeader "Content-length", params.length ;   http.setRequestHeader "Connection", "close" ;       callback function   http.onreadystatechange=processResult;       make Ajax call with params   http.send params ; }  This code differs from the code for the GET request in several ways. The first is that after encoding, the spaces in the parameters are converted from %20 to +. The second is  they’re  concatenated  into  a  parameter-formatted  string,  which  is  sent  within  the send method. The first parameter of the open method is set to POST, but the other two parameters are the same as those sent with the GET request: the application URL and the asynchronous flag. Additional  calls  are  made  to  the  setRequestHeader  method,  to  set  Connection  and Content-length request headers. You can use it to send any HTTP request header, but  18.3  Determining the Type of Query Call   419   you must provide the Content-Type for the POST—in this case, a multipart form re- quest. Both  of  the  request  approaches  set  the  callback  function  for  the  Ajax  object  call’s onreadystatechange event handler. See Also Recipe 18.1 covers how to get the XMLHttpRequest object, and Recipe 18.2 covers how to encode parameters.  18.4  Adding a Callback Function to an Ajax Request Problem You want to process the result of an Ajax request, even if the result does an update rather than a query. Solution When  processing  the  Ajax  request,  before  calling  the  XMLHttpRequest  object’s  send method,  assign  the  object’s  onreadystatechange  property  to  the  callback  function’s name:  xmlhttp.open "GET", url, true ; xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=callbackFunction; xmlhttp.send null ;  Discussion The readyState attribute for the XMLHttpRequest object is updated based on the state of the  request.  In  order  to  check  the  state  of  the  request,  you  need  to  assign  the onreadystatechange event handler to a callback function that is called every time the ready state changes. You should use  onreadystatechange with every Ajax call, even one in which you’re doing an update rather than processing a request. Without the callback function, you have no way of knowing if the update operation was successful, and if not, what kind of error occurred. The readyState property has the values shown in Table 18-1 during the Ajax request.  Table 18-1. Values of XMLHttpRequest readyState property  Value 0 1 2  STATE UNINITIALIZED LOADING LOADED  Purpose open has not been called yet send has not been called yet send has been called  420  Chapter 18: Communication   Value 3 4  STATE INTERACTIVE COMPLETED  Purpose Downloading response is not completed Request is complete  You should not set onreadystatechange if your request is synchronous, because the code won’t continue until the request returns anyway—you can check the result of the op- eration in the very next line of the code, if you’re so inclined.  I  can’t  stress  strongly  enough:  please  avoid  synchronous  Ajax  calls. Locking the page up until the request finishes is just not a good thing.  See Also Recipe 18.5 covers how to check the status and results of an Ajax request.  18.5  Checking for an Error Condition Problem You want to check the status of the Ajax request. Solution In addition to checking the readyState property in the onreadystatechange event han- dler, you can also check the XMLHttpRequest’s status:  function processResult   {    if  http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200  {       document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=http.responseText;    } }  Discussion The XMLHttpRequest’s status property is where the response to the request is returned. You hope for a value of 200, which means the request is successful. If the request is something  else,  such  as  403   forbidden   or  500   server  error ,  you  can  access  the XMLHttpRequest’s statusText property to get more detailed information:  function processResult   {    if  http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200  {       document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=http.responseText;    } else {       alert http.statusText ;  18.5  Checking for an Error Condition  421      } }  18.6  Processing a Text Result Problem You want to process HTML returned as text. Solution If you trust the server application, and the text is formatted to use immediately in the page, the simplest approach is to assign the text to the innerHTML property of the element where it should be placed:  function processResult   {    if  http.readyState == 4 && http.status == 200  {       document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML=http.responseText;    } }  Discussion If you’re writing both the server and client sides of the application, why make it hard on yourself? Format the response in the server application in such a way that it can be added into the web page using the easiest possible approach, and nothing is easier than innerHTML. However, if the response text isn’t formatted for immediate publication, you’ll have to use String functions, possibly in combination with regular expressions, to extract the data you need. If HTML formatting isn’t possible or desirable, and you have any control of the server application, try to format it either as XML or JSON, both of which can be more easily supported in the JavaScript environment. See Also See Recipe 19.1 for extracting information from an XML response. See Recipe 19.4 and Recipe  19.5  for  converting  JSON  formatted  text  into  a  JavaScript  object.  See  Rec- ipe 12.1 for an introduction to innerHTML.  18.7  Making an Ajax Request to Another Domain  Using JSONP  Problem You want to query for data using a web service API, such as the Netflix API or Twitter’s API. However, the Ajax same-origin policy prevents cross-domain communication.  422  Chapter 18: Communication   Solution The most commonly used technique to solve the cross-domain problem, and the ap- proach I recommend, is to create a server-side proxy application that is called in the Ajax application. The proxy then makes the call to the other service’s API, returning the result to the client application. This is safe, secure, and very efficient, because we can clean the data before returning it to the Ajax application. There is another approach: use JSONP  JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, with Padding   to  workaround  the  security  issues.  I  once  used  this  approach  to  create  a mashup between Google Maps and a Flickr query result:  function addScript  url  {    var script = document.createElement 'script' ;    script.type="text javascript";    script.src = url;    document.getElementsByTagName 'head' [0].appendChild script ;  The URL looked like the following, including a request to return the data formatted as JSON, and providing a callback function name:  http:  api.flickr.com services rest ?method=flickr.photos.search&user_id=xxx&api_ke y=xxx&format=json& jsoncallback=processPhotos  When the script tag is created, the request to Flickr is made, and since I passed in the request for a JSON formatted result and provided a callback function name, that’s how the return was provided. The callback string is similar to the following:     assign photos globally, call first to load function processPhotos obj  {   photos = obj.photos.photo;   ... }  The callback function would pass the data formatted as a JSON object in the function argument. Discussion Ajax works within a protected environment that ensures we don’t end up embedding dangerous text or code into a web page because of a call to an external application  which may or may not be secure . The downside to this security is that we can’t directly access services to external APIs, such Flickr, Twitter, and Google. Instead, we need to create a server-side proxy appli- cation, because server applications don’t face the cross-domain restriction. The workaround is to use something like JSONP, demonstrated in the solution. Instead of using XMLHttpRequest, we convert the request URL into one that we can attach to a script’s  src  attribute,  because  the  script  element  does  not  follow  the  same-origin  18.7  Making an Ajax Request to Another Domain  Using JSONP    423   policy. It couldn’t, or we wouldn’t be able to embed applications such as Google Maps into the application. If the service is amenable, it returns the data formatted as JSON, even wrapping it in a callback function. When the script is created, it’s no different than if the function call is made directly in our code, and we’ve passed an object as a parameter. We don’t even have to worry about converting the string to a JavaScript object. It’s a clever trick, but I don’t recommend it. Even with secure services such as Flickr and Twitter, there is the remote possibility that someone could find a way to inject JavaScript into the data via the client-side application for the service, which can cause havoc in our own applications. It’s better to be smart then clever. Use a proxy application, scrub the result, and then pass it on to your client application. See Also Chapter 19 covers JSON in more detail.  18.8  Populating a Selection List from the Server Problem Based on a user’s actions with another form element, you want to populate a selection list with values. Solution Capture the change event for the trigger form element:  document.getElementById "nicething" .onchange=populateSelect;  In the event handler function, make an Ajax call with the form data:  var url = "nicething.php?nicething=" + value; xmlhttp.open 'GET', url, true ; xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = getThings; xmlhttp.send null ;  In the Ajax result function, populate the selection list:     if xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200  {      var select = document.getElementById "nicestuff" ;      select.length=0;      var nicethings = xmlhttp.responseText.split "," ;      for  var i = 0; i < nicethings.length; i++  {        select.options[select.length] = new Option nicethings[i],nicethings[i] ;      }      select.style.display="block";    } else if  xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status != 200  {  424  Chapter 18: Communication        document.getElementById 'nicestuff' .innerHTML = 'Error: Search Failed!';    }  Discussion One of the more common forms of Ajax is to populate a select or other form element based on a choice made by the user. Rather than have to populate a select element with many options, or build a set of 10 or 20 radio buttons, you can capture the user’s choice in another form element, query a server application based on the value, and then build the other form elements based on the value—all without leaving the page. Example 18-1 demonstrates a simple page that captures the change event for radio buttons within a fieldset element, makes an Ajax query with the value of the selected radio button, and populates a selection list by parsing the returned option list. A comma separates each of the option items, and new options are created with the returned text having both an option label and option value. Before populating the select element, its length is set to 0. This is a quick and easy way to truncate the select element— removing all existing options, and starting fresh.  Example 18-1. Creating an on-demand select Ajax application       On Demand Select    nicestuff {   display: none;   margin: 10px 0; } nicething {   width: 400px; }      var xmlhttp;    var value;  function populateSelect   {    var inputs = this.getElementsByTagName 'input' ;   for  var i = 0; i < inputs.length; i++  {     if  inputs[i].checked  {       value = inputs[i].value;       break;     }   }       prepare request  18.8  Populating a Selection List from the Server   425     if  !xmlhttp  {     xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   }   var url = "nicething.php?nicething=" + value;   xmlhttp.open 'GET', url, true ;   xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = getThings;   xmlhttp.send null ; }    process return function getThings   {    if xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200  {      var select = document.getElementById "nicestuff" ;      select.length=0;      var nicethings = xmlhttp.responseText.split "," ;      for  var i = 0; i < nicethings.length; i++  {        select.options[select.length] = new Option nicethings[i], nicethings[i] ;      }      select.style.display="block";    } else if  xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status != 200  {      alert "No items returned for request" ;    } }  window.onload=function   {     document.getElementById "submitbutton" .style.display="none";    document.getElementById "nicething" .onclick=populateSelect; }            Select one:     <label for="bird">Birds    <label for="flower">Flowers    <label for="sweets">Sweets      Cute Critters            The form does have an assigned action page, and a submit button that’s hidden when the script is first run. These are the backup if scripting is turned off.  426  Chapter 18: Communication   18.9  Using a Timer to Automatically Update the Page with Fresh Data Problem You want to display entries from a file, but the file is updated frequently. Solution Use Ajax and a timer to periodically check the file for new values and update the display accordingly. The Ajax we use is no different than any other Ajax request. We’ll use a GET, because we’re  retrieving  data.  We  put  together  the  request,  attach  a  function  to  the onreadystatechange event handler, and send the request:  var url = "updatedtextfile.txt"; xmlhttp.open "GET", url, true ; xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=updateList; xmlhttp.send null ;  The fact that we’re doing a direct request on a static text file might be new, but re- member that a GET request is more or less the same as the requests we put into the location bar of our browsers. If something works in the browser, it should successfully return in an Ajax GET request...within reason. In the code that processes the response, we just place the new text into a new unordered list item and append it to an existing ul element:     process return function processResponse   {    if xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status == 200  {      var li = document.createElement "li" ;      var txt = document.createTextNode xmlhttp.responseText ;      li.appendChild txt ;      document.getElementById "update" .appendChild li ;    } else if  xmlhttp.readyState == 4 && xmlhttp.status != 200  {      alert xmlhttp.responseText ;    } }  The new part is the timer. The timer is controlled with start and stop buttons. When the start button is clicked the first time, the code disables the start button first, initiates the first Ajax call, and then starts a timer. There’s a reason for this, as we’ll see in a second:     timer function startTimer   {   populateList  ;   timer=setTimeout timerEvent,15000 ; }  18.9  Using a Timer to Automatically Update the Page with Fresh Data  427   The reason we want to make the Ajax call first is that the timer function timerEvent checks the readyState of the XMLHttpRequest object when it’s invoked. If the value is not 4, which means the last request was completed, it doesn’t make another Ajax call. We don’t want to have multiple requests out at the same time:  function timerEvent   {   if  xmlhttp.readyState == 4  {     populateList  ;   }   timer=setTimeout timerEvent, 15000 ; }  function stopTimer   {   clearTimeout timer ; }  Lastly, we’ll add a cancel timer event. In this case we’re using a global timer variable, but in a production application we want to use either an anonymous function to wrap everything, or create an object literal to maintain both data and methods:  Discussion The key to using timers with Ajax calls is to make sure that the last call is completed before making the next. By including a check on the  XMLHttpRequest object’s ready State property, if the value isn’t 4, we know to skip this Ajax call and just reset the timer for the next go round. We can also put in a check for the request status, and cancel the timer event altogether if we’re concerned about hitting a failing service, over and over again. When I ran the application that included the solution code, I changed the text file by using the Unix echo command:  $ echo "This is working" > text.txt  And then watched as the text showed up on the page, as shown in Figure 18-1. If you’re planning on using this form of polling with another service, such as against the Twitter API, be aware that if you’re considered abusive of the service, you may get kicked off. Check to see if there are restrictions for how often you can access a service using the API.  Depending on the browser, you may run into caching issues if you access the text.txt file locally. Providing a full URL should prevent this from occurring.  A few years ago, there was interest in a push rather than pull type of Ajax communi- cation. Encompassed under the coined term of Comet, the concept was that the server would initiate the communication and push the data to the client, rather than the client pulling the data from the server. Eventually, the concept led to work in the W3C on a  428  Chapter 18: Communication   Figure 18-1. Demonstration of updates from polled Ajax calls  new JavaScript API called WebSockets. Currently only implemented in Chrome, Web- Sockets enables bidirectional communication between server and client by using the send method on the WebSocket object for communicating to the server, and then at- taching a function to WebSocket’s onmessage event handler to get messages back from the server, as demonstrated in the following code from the Chromium Blog:   if  "WebSocket" in window  {   var ws = new WebSocket "ws:  example.com service" ;   ws.onopen = function   {        Web Socket is connected. You can send data by send   method.     ws.send "message to send" ; ....   };   ws.onmessage = function  evt  { var received_msg = evt.data; ... };   ws.onclose = function   {    websocket is closed. }; } else {      the browser doesn't support WebSocket. }  Another approach is a concept known as long polling. In long polling, we initiate an Ajax request as we do now, but the server doesn’t respond right away. Instead, it holds the connection open and does not respond until it has the requested data, or until a waiting time is exceeded. See Also See Recipe 14.8 for a demonstration of using this same functionality with an ARIA live region to ensure the application is accessible for those using screen readers. The W3C WebSockets API specification is located at http:  dev.w3.org html5 websockets , and the  18.9  Using a Timer to Automatically Update the Page with Fresh Data  429   Chrome introduction of support for WebSockets is at http:  blog.chromium.org 2009  12 web-sockets-now-available-in-google.html.  18.10  Communicating Across Windows with PostMessage Problem Your application needs  to communicate with a widget that’s located in an iFrame. However, you don’t want to have to send the communication through the network. Solution Use the new HTML5 postMessage to enable back-and-forth communication with the iFrame widget, bypassing network communication altogether. One or both windows can add an event listener for the new message event. To ensure the event handling works with IE as well as Opera, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome, using object detection:  The sender window that has the iFrame prepares and posts the message to the widget window:  function manageEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } }  function sendMessage   {   try {     var farAwayWindow = document.getElementById "widgetId" .contentWindow;     farAwayWindow.postMessage  "dragonfly6.thumbnail.jpg,Dragonfly on flower",                               'http:  burningbird.net' ;   } catch  e  {     alert e ;   } };  Two parameters are required for the HTML5 implementation of postMessage: the first is the message string; the second is the target window’s origin. If the iFrame window’s source  is  something  like  http:  somecompany.com test testwindow.html,  then  the target origin would be http:  somecompany.com. You could also use “*” for the target origin. This is a wildcard, which means the value will match to any origin. In the receiving window, an event listener picks up the message and responds accord- ingly. In this example, the string is split on the comma  , ; the first part of the string is  430  Chapter 18: Communication   assigned the image element’s src property, and the second is assigned the image ele- ment’s alt property:  function receive e  {     var img = document.getElementById "image" ;    img.src = e.data.split "," [0];    img.alt = e.data.split "," [1];      e.source.postMessage "Received " + e.data, "*" ; }  In the code, the widget window responds with a postMessage of its own, but uses the wildcard origin. The widget window also doesn’t check to see what domain sent the message. But when it responds, the host window checks origin:  function receive e  {   if  e.origin == "http:  burningbird.net"      ... does something with response message }  Discussion The  postMessage  functionality  is  based  on  listener sender  functionality.  Exam- ple 18-2 contains an example sender page. It contains an iFrame in which a requested image is displayed when the cross-document communication finishes. When you click on the web page, a message is posted to the listener to parse the message, find the name for a photograph, and add the photograph to an img element in the page.  Example 18-2. Sender page       Sender     function manageEvent eventObj, event, eventHandler  {    if  eventObj.addEventListener  {       eventObj.addEventListener event, eventHandler,false ;    } else if  eventObj.attachEvent  {       event = "on" + event;       eventObj.attachEvent event, eventHandler ;    } }  window.onload=function   {    manageEvent document.getElementById "button1" ,"click",sendMessage ;   manageEvent window,"message",receive ;  }     make sure to change URL to your location function sendMessage   {  18.10  Communicating Across Windows with PostMessage  431     try {     var farAwayWindow = document.getElementById "widgetId" .contentWindow;     farAwayWindow.postMessage  "dragonfly6.thumbnail.jpg,Dragonfly on flower",                               'http:  jscb.burningbird.net' ;   } catch  e  {     alert e ;   } };     change URL to your location function receive e  {   if  e.origin == "http:  jscb.burningbird.net"      alert e.data ; }          Load the photo         Example 18-3 contains the listener page.  Example 18-3.

Figure 18-2. Result of postMessage communication and loading an image  The new postMessage will soon be joined by a message channel capability, and both are attuned to use with widgets. This capability enables a higher level of interactivity be- tween the hosting window and the widget that wasn’t possible before, either because of network activity or because of same-origin security restrictions. The loosening of security restrictions is also a risk associated with postMessage. We can help mitigate the risk by following some simple rules:    Use the targetOrigin rather than the wildcard  *  when posting a message.   Use the origin value in the return message object to ensure the sender is the ex-  pected agent.    Check and double-check message data received. Needless to say, don’t pass it to  eval, and avoid plunking the data directly into a page using innerHTML.  Companies providing widgets can also add a layer of security. For instance, when a person downloads a widget, he also registers the domain where the widget is used. This is the same functionality that Google uses when you use the Google Maps API: you register the domain where the map API is used, and if the domain differs, the API doesn’t work.  18.10  Communicating Across Windows with PostMessage  433   The widget company can use this to check the message’s origin, and also use this in- formation when sending any postMessage response. In addition, the widget company can use whatever precaution necessary with the sent data and respond in kind.  434  Chapter 18: Communication   CHAPTER 19 Working with Structured Data  19.0  Introduction Even though it’s primarily a client-side development tool, JavaScript has access to sev- eral very sophisticated techniques and mechanisms for working with structured data. Originally, most complex data management, particularly in relation to Ajax calls, was based either in HTML fragments or XML. HTML fragments are still popular. When returned  from  an  Ajax  request,  the  HTML  formatted  string  can  be  used  with innerHTML in order to easily append the HTML into the page. Of course, you have to trust the data you receive, and you can’t manipulate it until you actually insert the data into the page. Either that, or use various String functions to parse pieces out of the HTML string. Data returned as XML is a richer option, because you can use the string to create a separate document object, from which you can access individual elements, just like you query the web page document now. XML data is still widely supported, but another structure has gained a great deal of popularity: JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON. It’s so popular that JSON has been added to the most recent version of JavaScript, ECMAScript 5. JSON provides the richness of XML but without the performance hit client-side processing of XML can add. JSON is basically the string serialization of JavaScript objects. Before ECMAScript 5, you had to use the eval function to convert the string to an object . Unfortunately, using the eval function on an unknown string is an application-security vulnerability. To ensure the string was safe, the originator of JSON, Douglas Crockford, created a library to process the JSON safely. The same functionality is now built into JavaScript. Support for complex data extends beyond what is built into JavaScript. There are mul- tiple  approaches  for  annotating  the  web  page  elements  with  metadata  that  can  be accessed  within  the  page  and  without.  Two  metadata  approaches,  RDFa  and  435   Microformats, have widespread support, including specialized JavaScript libraries. I’ll be touching on these later in the chapter.  19.1  Process an XML Document Returned from an Ajax Call Problem You need to prepare your Ajax application to deal with data returned formatted as XML. Solution Access the returned XML via the responseXML property on the XMLHttpRequest object:  if  xmlHttpObj.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpObj.status == 200  {    var citynodes = xmlHttpObj.responseXML.getElementsByTagName "city" ;    ... }  Discussion When an Ajax request returns XML, it can be accessed as a document object via the XMLHttpRequest object’s responseXML property. You can then use the query techniques covered in earlier chapters, such as Chapter 11, to access any of the data in the returned XML. If the server-side application is returning XML, it’s important that it return a MIME type of text xml, or the responseXML property will be null. If you’re unsure whether the API returns the proper MIME type, or if you have no control over the API, you can override the MIME type when you access the XMLHttpRequest object:  if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {    xmlHttpObj = new XMLHttpRequest  ;    if  xmlHttpObj.overrideMimeType  {        xmlHttpObj.overrideMimeType 'text xml' ;    } }  The overrideMimeType is not supported with IE, nor is it supported in the first draft for the W3C XMLHttpRequest specification. If you want to use responseXML, either change the server-side application so that it supports the text xml MIME type, or convert the text into XML using the following cross-browser technique:  if  window.DOMParser  {    parser=new DOMParser  ;    xmlResult = parser.parserFromString xmlHttpObj.responseText,    "text xml" ; } else {    xmlResult = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLDOM" ;    xmlResult.async = "false"    xmlResult.loadXML xmlHttpObj.responseText ;  436  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   } var stories = xmlResult.getElementsByTagName "story" ;  Parsing XML in this way adds another level of processing. It’s better, if possible, to return the data formatted as XML from the service. See Also The  W3C  specification  for  XMLHttpRequest  can  be  found  at  http:  www.w3.org TR  XMLHttpRequest .  19.2  Extracting Pertinent Information from an XML Tree Problem You want to access individual pieces of data from an XML document. Solution Use the same DOM methods you use to query your web page elements to query the XML document. As an example, the following will get all elements that have a tag name of "story":  var stories = xmlHttpObj.responseXML.getElementsByTagName "story" ;  Discussion Once you have the XML document, you can use the DOM methods covered in Chap- ter 11 to query any of the data in the document via the Ajax responseXML property, or even one that you’ve created yourself from scratch. To demonstrate, Example 19-1 shows a PHP application that returns an XML result when passed a category value. The application returns a list of stories by category, and their associated URL. If the category string isn’t passed or the category isn’t found, the application returns an error message that’s formatted in the same formatting as the other values, except that the URL value is set to “none”. This ensures a consistent result from the application. It’s not a complicated application or a complex XML result, but it’s sufficient to dem- onstrate how XML querying works. Notice that the header is instructed to return the content with a MIME type of text xml.  Example 19-1. PHP application that returns an XML result  <?php      If no search string is passed, then we can't search   if empty $_GET['category']   {     $result = "  none  No Category Sent  ";  19.2  Extracting Pertinent Information from an XML Tree  437     } else {       Remove whitespace from beginning & end of passed search.     $search = trim $_GET['category'] ;     switch $search  {       case "CSS" :          $result = "   http:  realtech.burningbird.net graphics css opacity-returns-ie8  " .

The application cycles through the collection, accessing each story element in order to access the story URL and the title, both of which are child nodes. Each is accessed via the childNodes collection, and their data, contained in the nodeValue attribute, is extracted. The story data is used to build a string of linked story titles, which is output to the page, as shown in Figure 19-1. Note that rather than use a succession of childNodes element collections to walk the trees, I could have used the Selectors API to access all URLs and titles, and then traversed both collections at one time, pulling the paired values from each, in sequence:  var urls = xmlHttpObj.responseXML.querySelectorAll "story url" ; var titles = xmlHttpObj.responseXML.querySelectorAll "story title" ;  440  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   for  var i = 0; i < urls.length; i++  {         var url = urls[i].firstChild.nodeValue;         var title = titles[i].firstChild.nodeValue;         if  url === "none"              str += title + " ";         else             str += " " + title + "  ";        } }  I could have also used getElementsByTagName against each returned story element— anything that works with the web page works with the returned XML.  Figure 19-1. Processing XML: returning story titles and URLs from a server-side application  The try...catch error handling should catch any query that fails because the XML is incomplete. In the example, the error is printed out in an alert—but you’ll want to use friendlier and more helpful error handling.  The document returned in responseXML, or created using DOMParser, has access to the XML DOM APIs, but not the HTML DOM APIs. For the most  part,  this  shouldn’t  be  a  problem,  as  most  of  the  functionality you’ll use is based on the more generic XML DOM APIs.  See Also Chapter 11 covers most of the DOM query techniques that work with the XML returned via responseXML, as well as accessing the web page elements. Recipe 9.4 demonstrates how  to  process  radio  button  events,  and  Recipe  12.1  demonstrates  how  to  use innerHTML to update the web page contents.  19.2  Extracting Pertinent Information from an XML Tree  441   Recipe 19.1 provides a way to process XML when it’s returned as text, via responseText.  19.3  Generate a JavaScript Object with JSON, Old-School Style Problem You need to convert the JSON text from an Ajax call into a JavaScript object. Solution Use the eval function to evaluate the string formatted as JSON, creating a JavaScript object using the following syntax:  var jsonobj = '{"test" : "value1", "test2" : 3.44, "test3" : true}'; var obj = eval " " + jsonobj + " " ; alert obj.test2 ;    prints out 3.44  or the following:  var jsonobj = '{"test" : "value1", "test2" : 3.44, "test3" : true}'; eval "var obj="+jsonobj ; alert obj.test ;  Discussion The solution presents a simple, three-property object created in JSON. To figure out how to create JSON, think about how you create an object literal and just translate it into a string. If the object is an array:  var arr = new Array "one","two","three" ;  the JSON notation would be equivalent to the literal notation for the array:  "['one','two','three'];  If an object:  var obj3 = {    prop1 : "test",    result : true,    num : 5.44,    name : "Joe",    cts : [45,62,13]};  the JSON notation would be:  {"prop1":"test","result":true,"num":5.44,"name":"Joe","cts":[45,62,13]}  Notice in JSON how the property names are in quotes, but the values are only quoted when they’re strings. In addition, if the object contains other objects, such as an array, it’s also transformed into its JSON equivalent. However, the object cannot contain methods. If it does, an error is thrown. JSON works with data objects only.  442  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   The two “old-school” techniques to generate objects from the JSON formatted string use the eval method. The first assigns the object to a variable and requires that you surround the JSON with parentheses:  var obj = eval  " " + objJSON + " " ;  The reason for the parentheses is so the eval statement treats the text as an object initializer, rather than some other type of code. The second approach is to include the variable assignment as the left side of the ex- pression and the JSON as the right, within the eval method:  eval "obj=" + objJSON ;  The result of the eval function is a JavaScript object, in which you can access values directly:  alert obj3.prop1 ;    prints out test  The use of JSON exploded with the growing popularity of Ajax. Rather than returning plain text, HTML, or XML, applications could return a text string formatted as JSON, and the text could be converted to a JavaScript object with one function call. Of course, this meant that the JSON was inherently insecure. If you couldn’t trust in the source of the string, you certainly couldn’t trust it to the eval method, which pro- cesses whatever string is passed to it. To work around the insecurities of JSON, Douglas Crockford, the father of JSON, created json2.js, a small library that provides a safe version of eval. Once you include the library, you process the JSON using the following syntax:  var obj = JSON.parse objJSON ;  Discover more variations of JSON syntax at http:  www.json.org. The site also includes a link to json2.js.  See Also Until the built-in JSON capability is supported in all your site’s target browsers, you’ll still need the old-school JSON techniques. However, using the json2.js library can em- ulate a built-in JSON object, introduced in Recipe 19.5.  19.3  Generate a JavaScript Object with JSON, Old-School Style  443   19.4  Parse a JSON Formatted String Problem You want to safely create a JavaScript object from JSON. You also want to replace the numeric  representation  of  true  and  false   0  and  1,  respectively   with  their  Boolean counterparts  false and true . Solution Parse the object with the new JSON built-in capability, added to browsers in ECMA- Script  5.  To  transform  the  numeric  values  to  their  Boolean  counterparts,  create  a replacer function:  var jsonobj = '{"test" : "value1", "test2" : 3.44, "test3" : 0}'; var obj = JSON.parse jsonobj, function  key, value  {    if  typeof value == 'number'  {       if  value == 0           value = false;       else if  value == 1  {          value = true;       }     }     return value;     } ;   alert obj.test3 ;    prints false  Discussion ECMAScript 5 added native support for JSON with the JSON object. It’s not a complex object, as it only provides two methods: stringify and parse. Like Math, it’s a static object that you use directly. The  parse  method  takes  two  arguments:  a  JSON  formatted  string  and  an  optional replacer function. This function takes a key value pair as parameters, and returns either the original value or a modified result. In the solution, the JSON formatted string is an object with three properties: a string, a numeric, and a third property, which has a numeric value but is really a Boolean with a numeric representation: 0 is false, 1 is true. To  transform  all  0,  1  values  into  false,  true,  a  function  is  provided  as  the  second argument to JSON.parse. It checks each property of the object to see if it is a numeric. If it is, the function checks to see if the value is 0 or 1. If the value is 0, the return value is  set  to  false;  if  1,  the  return  value  is  set  to  true;  otherwise,  the  original  value  is returned.  444  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   The ability to transform incoming JSON formatted data is essential, especially if you’re processing the result of an Ajax request or JSONP response. You can’t always control the structure of the data you get from a service.  IE8 does not support the JSON object. Opera has placed some restrictions on what can be supported in JSON: strings must be double quoted, and there are no hexadecimal values and no tabs in strings.  See Also See Recipe 19.5 for a demonstration of JSON.stringify.  19.5  Convert an Object to a Filtered Transformed String with JSON Problem You need to convert a JavaScript object to a JSON formatted string for posting to a web application. However, the web application has data requirements that differ from your client application. Solution Use the JSON.stringify method, passing in the object as first parameter and providing a transforming function as the second parameter:  function convertBoolToNums key, value  {      if  typeof value == 'boolean'  {         if  value             value = 1;          else            value = 0;       }       return value; };  window.onload=function   {    var obj = {"test" : "value1", "test2" : 3.44, "test3" : false};   var jsonobj = JSON.stringify obj, convertBoolToNums, 3 ;    alert jsonobj ;    test3 should be 0 }  19 5  Convert an Object to a Filtered Transformed String with JSON  445   Discussion The JSON.stringify method takes three parameters: the object to be transformed into JSON, an optional function or array used either to transform or filter one or more object values,  and  an  optional  third  parameter  that  defines  how  much  and  what  kind  of whitespace is used in the generated result. In the solution, a function is used to check property values, and if the value is a Boolean, convert false to 0, and true to 1. The function results are transformed into a string if the return value is a number or Boolean. The function can also act as a filter: if the returned value from the function is null, the property value pair are removed from the JSON. You  can  also  use  an  array  rather  than  a  function.  The  array  can  contain  strings  or numbers, but is a whitelist of properties that are allowed in the result. The following code:  var whitelist = ["test","test2"];  var obj = {"test" : "value1", "test2" : 3.44, "test3" : false}; var jsonobj = JSON.stringify obj, whitelist, 3 ;  would result in a JSON string including the object’s test and test2 properties, but not the third property  test3 :  The last parameter controls how much whitespace is used in the result. It can be a number representing the number of spaces or a string. If it is a string, the first 10 char- acters are used as whitespace. If I use the following:  var jsonobj = JSON.stringify obj, whitelist, "***" ;  {    "test": "value1",    "test2": 3.44 }  the result is:  { ***"test": "value1", ***"test2": 3.44 }  The use of stringify with a replacer function worked with Safari 4, but did not suc- cessfully transform the Boolean value with Firefox. At the time this was written, there is an active bug for Firefox because the replacer function only works with arrays. See Also See Recipe 19.4 for a discussion on JSON.parse.  446  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   19.6  Convert hCalendar Microformat Annotations into a Canvas Timeline Problem You want to plot the events annotated with the hCalendar Microformat on a Canvas- based graph. The hCalendar event syntax can differ, as the following two legitimate variations demonstrate:       Monkey Play Time   on  2010-02-05   at  St. Louis Zoo .          February 25th ,      2010     Event    With one format, the dtstart class is on a span element; with the other format, the dtstart class is on an abbr element. Solution Find all elements with a class of vevent:  var events = document.querySelectorAll "[class='vevent']" ; var v = events;  Within each, find the element with a class of dtstart. There should only be one, and there should always be one. By Microformat convention, if the dtstart element is an abbr, the start date is found in a title attribute on the element. If the dtstart element is a span, the start date is found in the element’s textContent, and is then split out of the date string to find the actual day:  var days = new Array  ; for  var i = 0; i < events.length; i++  {    var dstart = events[i].querySelectorAll "[class='dtstart']" ;    var dt;    if  dstart[0].tagName == "SPAN"  {       dt = dstart[0].textContent;     }    else if  dstart[0].tagName == "ABBR"  {       dt = dstart[0].title;    }    var day = parseInt dt.split "-" [2] ;    days.push day ; }  The value is then used to graph the line in a canvas element.  19.6  Convert hCalendar Microformat Annotations into a Canvas Timeline  447   Discussion Microformats are both simple and complicated. They’re simple in that it’s easy to find the data, but they’re complicated because the rules surrounding the data are very loose. As the solution demonstrates, an hCalendar event start date can be recorded in span elements or abbr elements; the dates are ISO 8601, but could be just dates, or datetime. The advantage to working with Microformats using client-side JavaScript is that we usually have some control over the format of the Microformats. For instance, if we have a social-networking site where people are entering events, we have no control over what events are created, but we do have control over the format and can ensure that it’s consistent. Once we know the form of the Microdata used in the page, it isn’t complicated to get the data. For the most part, we’re retrieving elements based on class name, and making queries on these elements’ subtrees for elements with different class names. Though there are few rules to Microformats, there are rules. For instance, the hCalendar data used in the solution has at least three rules: the outer element has a vevent class, there must be a summary and a dtstart element, and if the dtstart element is a span, the data is the textContent; if it is an abbr, the data is the title. Since IE8 does not support textContent, the code performs a test for textContent. If it isn’t  found,  then  IE8  gets  the  text  from  the   IE-originated   innerText  or  innerHTML property:  for  var i = 0; i < events.length; i++  {    var dstart = events[i].querySelectorAll "[class='dtstart']" ;    var dt;    if  dstart[0].tagName == "SPAN"  {       if  dstart[0].textContent           dt = dstart[0].textContent;       else         dt = dstart[0].innerText;    } else if  dstart[0].tagName == "ABBR"  {       dt = dstart[0].title;    }    var day = parseInt dt.split "-" [2] ;    days.push day ; }  Make sure to include the ExplorerCanvas excanvas.js library before your script, in order to ensure the canvas element and commands work with IE:        Example 19-3 pulls all of the components together into a full-page application, includ- ing the Canvas drawing. The tick marks in the Canvas element are expanded to 10 times their size to make them easier to see on the line. The page is an event calendar for a month at the zoo.  448  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   Example 19-3.

Here’s an example of the type of data in the page  from the RDFa specification :  450  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data    Biblio description  <dl about="http:  www.w3.org TR 2004 REC-rdf-mt-20040210 " id="biblio">    Title       RDF Semantics - W3C Recommendation 10 February 2004     Author                            Patrick Hayes        see <a rel="foaf:homepage" href="http:  www.ihmc.us users user.php?UserID=42">homepage                You want to convert that RDFa formatted data into a JavaScript object, and eventually into JSON for an Ajax call.  Figure 19-2. Microformat hCalendar application in IE  Solution Use one of the RDFa JavaScript libraries, such as rdfQuery, which has the added ad- vantage of being built on jQuery  the default JavaScript library used with Drupal . The  19.7  Glean Page RDFa and Convert It into JSON Using rdfQuery and the jQuery RDF Plug-in  451   rdfQuery library also implements an RDFa gleaner, which is functionality that can take a jQuery object and glean all of the RDFa from it and its subtree, automatically con- verting the data into RDF triples and storing them into an in-memory database:  var triplestore =  $ 'biblio' .rdf     .base 'http:  burningbird.net'    .prefix 'rdf','http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-synax-ns'    .prefix 'dc','http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 '    .prefix 'foaf','http:  xmlns.com foaf 0.1 ' ;  Once you have the data, you can export a JavaScript object of the triples:  var data = triplestore.databank.dump  ; And then you can convert that into JSON: var jsonStr = JSON.stringify d ;  Discussion RDF is a way of recording metadata in such a way that data from one site can be safely combined with data from many others, and queried for specific information or used in rules-based derivations. The data is stored in a format known as a triple, which is noth- ing more than a simple subject-predicate-object set usually displayed as:    foaf:primaryTopic   .   dc:creator "Jo" .  These triples basically say that the subject in this, a blog identified by a specific URL, has a primary topic of “bbq,” or barbecue, and the creator is named Jo. This is a book on JavaScript, so I don’t want to spend more time on RDFa or RDF. I’ll provide links later where you can get more information on both. For now, just be aware that we’re going to take that RDFa annotation in the page, convert it into a triple store using rdfQuery, and then export it as a JavaScript object, and eventually JSON. The RDFa, embedded into X HTML, has the opposite challenges from Microformats: the syntax is very regular and well-defined, but accessing the data can be quite chal- lenging. That’s the primary reason to use a library such as rdfQuery. In the solution, what the code does is use jQuery selector notation to access an element identified by “biblio”, and then use the .rdf   gleaner to extract all of the RDFa out of the object and its subtree and store it in an in-memory data store. The solution then maps the prefixes for the RDFa: dc is mapped to http:  purl.org dc  elements 1.1 , and so on. Once these two actions are finished, a dump of the store creates a JavaScript object containing the triple objects extracted from the RDFa, which are then converted into JSON using the JSON.stringify method. The resulting string with the five derived triples looks like this: {"http:  www.w3.org TR 2004 REC-rdf-mt- 20040210 ":{"http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 title":[{"type":"literal", "value":"RDF Semantics - W3C Recommendation 10 February 2004"}],"http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 creator":[{"type":"uri", "value":  452  Chapter 19: Working with Structured Data   "http:  burningbird.net jscb data rdfa.xhtmla1"}]}, "http:  burningbird.net jscb data rdfa.xhtmla1": {"http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax- nstype":[{"type":"uri","value":"http:  xmlns.com foaf 0.1 Person"}], "http:  xmlns.com foaf 0.1 name":[{"type":"literal","value":"Patrick Hayes"}],"http:  xmlns.com foaf 0.1 homepage":[{"type":"uri", "value":"http:  www.ihmc.us users user.php?UserID=42"}]}}  Which converts into Turtle notation as:       "RDF Semantics - W3C Recommendation 10 February 2004" .       .        .     "Patrick Hayes" .       .  Once you have the string, you can use it in an Ajax call to a web service that makes use of RDF or JSON, or both. Example 19-4 combines the pieces of the solution into a full-page application in order to more fully demonstrate how each of the components works together. The application prints  out  the  JSON.stringify  data  dump  of  the  data  and  then  prints  out  each  trip individually, converting the angle brackets of the triples first so that appending them to the page won’t trigger an XHTML parsing error.

Running the RDFa extraction application in Opera  19.7  Glean Page RDFa and Convert It into JSON Using rdfQuery and the jQuery RDF Plug-in  455    CHAPTER 20 Persistence  20.0  Introduction In the early years of web development, to keep a value around as users moved from page to page, you’d have to make use of session persistence functionality built into the environment, attach the data to the web page URL, or provide it in a hidden form field. Of course, this persisted the data from page to page, but once you closed the browser, the data was lost. JavaScript added a third approach, a cookie, which could not only persist from page to page, but cause the data to persist beyond the current session. With cookies, you could not only access data such as login information throughout a website, but you could close the browser and reopen it another day and still have access to the same data. These techniques still exist, but now, because of the needs of more complex web ap- plications, including applications that support offline functionality, browsers support a variety of sophisticated data storage and persistence techniques. No  area  of  JavaScript  has  gone  through  more  upheaval  recently  than  persistence. Whether it’s storing data between sessions or enabling access to information while offline, complex new ideas have been spawned, supported by web pages and imple- mentations, only to quietly fade away when something new and shiny appeared. Probably one of the more famous examples of an idea that came and went is Google Gears—an offline storage mechanism that generated considerable excitement in 2007 when it debuted, only to die a fairly quick and unexpected death when Google an- nounced in November 2009 that it was dropping support for Gears in favor of the new Web Applications HTML5 persistence initiatives. Fun new technology aside, the old approaches, such as using data encoding on an URL or a cookie, still exist and still provide a service that some of the newer techniques don’t provide: simplicity. This chapter touches on all of the techniques, from the old time to the new, the simple to the complex.  457   Some of the methods explored in this chapter are cutting edge, based on specifications that are still being developed. Use with caution.  See Also For more on Google’s Gears decision, see the blog post at http:  gearsblog.blogspot.com  2010 02 hello-html5.html.  20.1  Attaching Persistent Information to URLs Problem You want to store a small fragment of information so that the information is available to anyone accessing the page. Solution Persisting a fragment of information in a web page for general access by everyone is dependent on the old school capability of attaching information to a URL. The infor- mation can be passed as a page fragment:  http:  somecompany.com firstpage.htmlinfoasfragment  Discussion JavaScript can be used to add a page fragment, though this is more of a way to store a simple state than anything more complex:  http:  somecompany.com test.htmlone  The  data  can  also  be  encoded  as  parameters  in  a  query  string,  which  starts  with  a question mark, followed by the parameters passed as key value pairs separated by equal signs, and separated from each other by ampersands:  http:  somecompany.com?test=one&test=two  There are limits to lengths of URLs, and probably for numbers of GET pairs, but I would hope we wouldn’t ever approach these limits. This also isn’t an approach you would use in place of a cookie. For instance, if you want to capture user input into a form, in case the users have to leave before finishing the form entries  or they acciden- tally close their browser tab page , you should put this data into a cookie, which is more secure, and more specific to the person. Data encoding in the URL is more of a way to capture page state so that a person can send a link to the page in that state to another person, or link it within a web page. Example 20-1 demonstrates how something like data persistence via URL can work.  458  Chapter 20: Persistence   In the web page, there are three buttons and one div element controlled by the action of the buttons. One button moves the div element to the right, one button increases the size of the element, and one button changes its color. As each button is clicked, the div element is adjusted, and the newly applied CSS value is stored with the appropriate button. When the state of the page is changed, a link within the page is updated to reflect the state  of  the  page.  Note  that  the  actual  window.location  property  and  even  the window.location.search property is not changed. The reason is that the page reloads as a security precaution when you update any component of window.location except the hash value.  Allowing a person to change the URL in the location bar, which isn’t reflected in the actual page, introduces the threat of spoofing—one page masquerading as another in order to scam passwords and other confi- dential information.  Now you can reload the page and have the script restore the page to the state in the URL when it reloads—but that’s a lot of moving parts. In the example, we’ll just create a static state link, and leave it at that.  Example 20-1.

Page after reloading and using persistence through URL  20.2  Creating a Cookie to Persist Information Across Pages Problem You want to persist some information about or for the user within the existing browser session. Solution If the amount of data is less than 4k in size, use a browser cookie. A cookie is a patterned line of text that you assign to the document.cookie property:  document.cookie="cookiename=cookievalue; expires=date; path=path";  Discussion Cookies are still one of the easiest, simplest, and most widely used persistent storage technique  for  web  pages  today.  They’re  easy  to  set,  safe,  well  understood  by  most people who browse web pages, and require little overhead. People can also turn cookie support off in their browsers, which means your application has to work, regardless. In addition, the amount of data stored is small—less than 4k— and doesn’t support complex data structures. There’s also the security restrictions as- sociated with cookies: they’re domain-specific. Despite the restriction, though, cookies are also insecure, as any data stored is done so in plain text. You don’t want to use cookies to store passwords.  462  Chapter 20: Persistence   Read the article “Improving Persistent Login Cookie Best Practice” if you’re interested in implementing “Remember Me” using cookies on your site.  Cookies  are  created  by  assigning  the  cookie  to  the  document.cookie  property.  The cookie consists of a name value pair, separated by an equal sign:  document.cookie="cookiename=cookievalue";  There are parameters that can follow the cookie value pair, all separated by semi-colons  ; . The parameters are:  path=path  such as   or  subdir   Defaults to the current location.  domain=domain   such  as  burningbird.net,  for  all  subdomains,  or  a  given  subdomain, missourigreen.burningbird.net   Defaults to current host.  max-age=maximum age in seconds  Meant more for session-based short restrictions.  expires=date in GMTString-format  Defaults to expiring at end of session.  secure  Can only be transmitted via HTTPS.  Here’s an example. This cookie keyword is Language, with a value of JavaScript, set to expire at a given time with expires, and with path set to the top-level domain:  Language=JavaScript; expires=Mon, 22 Feb 2010 01:00:59 GMT; path=   If we wanted the cookie to expire when the browser closes, all we need do is leave off the expires. To retrieve the cookie, we have to retrieve the entire document.cookie property, which returns all cookies set on the domain. The application needs to find all of the cookies, and then look for a specific one. To erase the cookie, all we need do is set it with a past date. To demonstrate, Example 20-2 contains a web page that has two input fields, one for the cookie name and one for the value. Clicking the Set Cookie button creates the cookie; clicking the Get Cookie retrieves the value for the given cookie; clicking the Erase Cookie button erases the cookie.  20.2  Creating a Cookie to Persist Information Across Pages   463   Example 20-2.

In the past, we had the ability to persist information regarding the page state, though we’ve had to be conservative in how much data we persist. A popular approach, and one demonstrated in Recipe 20.1, is to store the data in the page URL hash, which updates the page history and can be pulled via JavaScript. The problem with this approach is that updating the hash may update the history. If you hit the back button, the URL with the hash shows in the location bar, but no event is triggered so you can grab the data and restore the page. The workaround was to use a timer to check for the new hash and then restore the page if a new hash was found. Not an attractive solution, and one most of us decided just wasn’t worth trying. Now, you can easily store any object that can be passed to JSON.stringify. Since the data is stored locally, the early implementor, Firefox, limits the size of the JSON rep- resentation to 640k. However, unless you’re recording the state of every pixel in the page, 640k should be more than sufficient. To see how the new event and methods work, Example 20-3 is a recreation of Exam- ple 8-2, from Recipe 8.8. The changes to the application include the removal of the use of  the  hash  location  fragment,  which  is  replaced  by  history.pushState,  and  the window.onpopstate event handler, both of which are highlighted in the code. There’s one other minor change—in the functionOne function, also highlighted—and I’ll get into the reason why after the example.  Example 20-3. Shows Example 8-2 from Recipe 8.8 converted to using the new history.pushState and window.onpopstate event handler       Remember me--new, and improved!         window.onload=function   {  466  Chapter 20: Persistence         document.getElementById "next" .onclick=nextPanel;    }     window.onpopstate = function event  {         check for event.state, if found, reload state       if  !event.state  return;       var page = event.state.page;       switch  page  {         case "one" :            functionOne  ;            break;         case "two" :            functionOne  ;            functionTwo  ;            break;         case "three" :            functionOne  ;            functionTwo  ;            functionThree  ;       }    }        display next panel, based on button's class    function nextPanel   {       var page = document.getElementById "next" .getAttribute "data-page" ;       switch page  {          case "zero" :             functionOne  ;             break;          case "one" :             functionTwo  ;             break;          case "two" :             functionThree  ;        }    }       set both the button class, and create the state link, add to page    function setPage page  {       document.getElementById "next" .setAttribute "data-page",page ;       window.history.pushState { page : page}, "Page " + page, "?page=" + page ;    }        function one, two, three - change div, set button and link    function functionOne   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.position="relative";       square.style.left="0";       square.style.backgroundColor="ff0000";       square.style.width="200px";       square.style.height="200px";       square.style.padding="10px";       square.style.margin="20px";       setPage "one" ;    }  20.3  Persisting Information Using the History.pushState Method and window.onpopevent   467      function functionTwo   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.backgroundColor="ffff00";       square.style.position="absolute";       square.style.left="200px";       setPage "two" ;    }     function functionThree   {       var square = document.getElementById "square" ;       square.style.width="400px";       square.style.height="400px";       square.style.backgroundColor="00ff00";       square.style.left="400px";       setPage "three" ;    }        Next Action     This is the object       In this example, the state object that is stored is extremely simple: a page property and its associated value. The history.pushState also takes a title parameter, which is used for the session history entry, and a URL. For the example, I appended a query string representing the page. What is displayed in the location bar is:  http:  somecom.com pushstate.html?page=three  The history.replaceState method takes the same parameters, but modifies the current history entry instead of creating a new one. When using the browser back button to traverse through the created history entries, or when hitting the page reload, a window.onpopstate event is fired. This is really the truly important component in this new functionality, and is the event we’ve needed for years. To restore the web page to the stored state, we create a window.onpopstate event handler function, accessing the state object from the event passed to the window han- dler function:  window.onpopstate = function event  {        check for event.state, if found, reload state      if  !event.state  return;      var page = event.state.page;      ...   }  In the example, when you click the button three times to get to the third “page,” reload the page, or hit the back button, the window.onpopstate event handlers fires. Perfect timing to get the state data, and repair the page. Works beautifully, too. In the Firefox Minefield edition, that is.  468  Chapter 20: Persistence   One other change that had to be made to the older example, is that functionOne had to be modified and the following style settings added:  square.style.position = "relative"; square.style.left = "0";  The reason is that unlike Example 8-2, which goes through a complete page reload, the new state methods and event handler actually do preserve the state in-page. This means the changes going from step one to step two  setting position to absolute and moving the div element  have to be canceled out in the first function in order to truly restore the page state. It’s a small price to pay for this lovely new functionality. Again, the example only worked with the Firefox nightly. However, the back button did seem to work with the WebKit nightly.  20.4  Using sessionStorage for Client-Side Storage Problem You want to easily store session information without running into the size and cross- page contamination problems associated with cookies, and prevent loss of information if the browser is refreshed. Solution Use the new DOM Storage sessionStorage functionality:  sessionStorage.setItem "name", "Shelley" ; sessionStorage.city="St. Louis"; ... var name = sessionStorage,getItem "name" ; var city = sessionStorage.city; ... sessionStorage.removeItem "name" ; sessionStorage.clear  ;  Discussion One of the constraints with cookies is they are domain subdomain-specific, not page- specific. Most of the time, this isn’t a problem. However, there are times when such domain specificity isn’t sufficient. For instance, a person has two browser tabs open to the same shopping site and adds a few items to the shopping cart in one tab. In the tab, the shopper clicks a button to add an item because of the admonishment to add the item to the cart in order to see the price. The shopper decides against the item and closes the tab page, thinking that action is enough to ensure the item isn’t in the cart. The shopper then clicks the check- out option in the other opened tag, assuming that the only items currently in the cart are the ones that were added in that browser page.  20.4  Using sessionStorage for Client-Side Storage  469   If the users aren’t paying attention, they may not notice that the cookie-based shopping cart has been updated from both pages, and they’ll end up buying something they didn’t want. While it is true that many web users are savvy enough to not make this mistake, there are many who aren’t; they assume that persistence is browser-page-specific, not nec- essarily domain-specific. With sessionStorage  to paraphrase the famous quote about Las Vegas , what happens in the page, stays in the page. As an example of the differences between the cookies and the new storage option, Example 20-4 stores information from a form in both a cookie and sessionStorage. Clicking the button to get the data gets whatever is stored for the key in both, and displays it in the page: the sessionStorage data in the first block, the cookie data in the second. The remove button erases whatever exists in both.  Example 20-4.

Add one or more items to the same key value, and then click the button labeled “Get data”, as shown in Figure 20-2. Now, open the same page in a new tab window, and click the “Get data” button. The activity results in a page like that shown in Figure 20-3. In the new tab window, the cookie value persists because the cookie is session-specific, which means it lasts until you close the browser. The cookie lives beyond the first tab window, but the sessionStorage, which is specific to the tab window, does not. Now, in the new tab window, add a couple more items to the key value, and click “Get data” again, as shown in Figure 20-4.  472  Chapter 20: Persistence   Figure 20-2. Showing current value for “apple” in sessionStorage and Cookie  Figure 20-3. Again, showing current value for “apple” in sessionStorage and Cookie, but in a new tab window  Return  to  the  original  tab  window,  and  click  “Get  data”.  As  you  can  see  in  Fig- ure 20-5, the items added in the second tab are showing with the cookie, but not the sessionStorage item.  20.4  Using sessionStorage for Client-Side Storage  473   Figure 20-4. Adding more values to “apple” in new tab window  Figure 20-5. Returning to the original tab window and clicking “Get data” with “apple”  Lastly, in the original tab window, click the “Erase data” button. Figure 20-6 shows the results of clicking “Get data” on the original window, while Figure 20-7 shows the results when clicking “Get data” in the second tab window. Again, note the disparities between the cookie and sessionStorage. The reason for all of these images is to demonstrate the significant differences between sessionStorage and cookies, aside from how they’re set and accessed in JavaScript.  474  Chapter 20: Persistence   Figure 20-6. After clicking the “Erase data” button in the original tab window, and then clicking “Get data”  Figure 20-7. Clicking “Get data” in the second window, after erasing data in first  Hopefully, the images and the example also demonstrate the potential hazards involved when using sessionStorage, especially in circumstances where cookies have normally been used. If your website or application users are familiar with the cookie persistence across tab- bed windows, sessionStorage can be an unpleasant surprise. Along with the different  20.4  Using sessionStorage for Client-Side Storage  475   behavior, there’s also the fact that browser menu options to delete cookies probably won’t have an impact on sessionStorage, which could also be an unwelcome surprise for your users. Use sessionStorage with caution. The sessionStorage object is currently supported in Firefox 3.5 and up, Safari 4.x and up, and IE 8. There are some implementation differences for sessionStorage, but the example shown in this recipe is consistently implemented across all environments. One last note on sessionStorage, as it relates to its implementation. Both sessionStor age and localStorage, covered in the next recipe, are part of the new DOM Storage specification, currently under development by the W3C. Both are window object prop- erties, which means they can be accessed globally. Both are implementations of the Storage object, and changes to the prototype for Storage result in changes to both the sessionStorage and localStorage objects:  Storage.prototype.someMethod = function  param  { ...}; ... localStorage.someMethod param ; ... sessionStorage.someMethod param ;  Aside from the differences, covered in this recipe and the next, another major difference is that the Storage objects don’t make a round trip to the server—they’re purely client- side storage techniques. See Also For  more  information  on  the  Storage  object,  sessionStorage,  localStorage,  or  the Storage DOM, consult the specification. See Recipe 20.5 for a different look at how sessionStorage and localStorage can be set and retrieved, and other supported prop- erties on both.  20.5  Creating a localStorage Client-Side Data Storage Item Problem You want to shadow form element entries  or any data  in such a way that if the browser crashes, the user accidentally closes the browser, or the Internet connection is lost, the user can continue. Solution You could use cookies if the data is small enough, but that strategy doesn’t work in an offline situation. Another, better approach, especially when you’re persisting larger amounts of data or if you have to support functionality when no Internet connection is present, is to use the new localStorage:  476  Chapter 20: Persistence   var value = document.getElementById "formelem" .value; If  value  {    localStorage.formelem = value; } ...    recover var value = localStorage.formelem; document.getElementById "formelem" .value = value;  Discussion Recipe 20.4 covered sessionStorage, one of the new DOM Storage techniques. The localStorage object interface is the same, with the same approaches to setting the data:     use item methods sessionStorage.setItem "key","value" ; localStorage.setItem "key","value" ;     use property names directly sessionStorage.keyName = "value: localStorage.keyName = "value";     use the key method sessionStorage.key 0  = "value"; localStorage.key 0  = "value:  and for getting the data:     use item methods value = sessionStorage.getItem "key" ; value = localStorage.getItem "key" ;     use property names directly value = sessionStorage.keyName: value = localStorage.keyName;     use the key method value = sessionStorage.key 0 ; value = localStorage.key 0 :  Both also support the length property, which provides a count of stored item pairs, and the clear method  no parameters , which clears out all Storage  but Firefox only supports clearing storage for localStorage . In addition, both are scoped to the HTML5 origin, which means that the data storage is shared across all pages in a domain, but not across protocols  e.g., http is not the same as https  or ports. The difference between the two is how long data is stored. The sessionStorage object only stores data for the session, but the localStorage object stores data on the client forever, or until specifically removed. The sessionStorage and localStorage objects also support one event: the storage event. This is an interesting event, in that it fires on all pages when changes are made to a localStorage item. It is also an area of low-compatibility among browsers: you can  20.5  Creating a localStorage Client-Side Data Storage Item  477   capture the event on the body or document elements for Firefox, on the body for IE, or on the document for Safari. Example 20-5 demonstrates a more comprehensive implementation than the use case covered in the solution for this recipe. In the example, all elements of a small form have their onchange event handler method assigned to a function that captures the change element name and value, and stores the values in the local storage via localStorage. When the form is submitted, all of the stored form data is cleared. When the page is loaded, the form elements onchange event handler is assigned to the function to store the values, and if the value is already stored, it is restored to the form element. To test the application, enter data into a couple of the form fields—but, before clicking the submit button, refresh the page. Without the use of localStorage, you’d lose the data. Now, when you reload the page, the form is restored to the state it was in before the page was reloaded.  Example 20-5. Using localStorage to back up form entries in case of page reload or browser crash         localstore             window.onload=function   {      try {         var elems = document.getElementsByTagName "input" ;             capture submit to clear storage         document.getElementById "inputform" .onsubmit=clearStored;          for  var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++  {             if  elems[i].type == "text"  {                   restore               var value = localStorage.getItem elems[i].id ;               if  value  elems[i].value = value;                   change event               elems[i].onchange=processField;            }        } catch  e  {        alert e ;      }    }        store field values    function processField   {      localStorage.setItem window.location.href,"true" ;      localStorage.setItem this.id, this.value ;  478  Chapter 20: Persistence      }        clear individual fields    function clearStored   {      var elems = document.getElementsByTagName "input" ;      for  var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++  {         if  elems[i].type == "text"  {           localStorage.removeItem elems[i].id ;        }      }    }                    Enter field1:               Enter field2:  <input type="text" id="field2"  >          Enter field1:               Enter field1:                   The size alloted for localStorage varies by browser, and some browsers, such as Firefox, allow users to extend the Storage object limits. The localStorage object can be used for offline work. For the form example, you can store the data in the localStorage and provide a button to click when connected to the Internet, in order to sync the data from localStorage to server-side storage. See Also See  Recipe  20.4  for  more  on  the  Storage  object,  and  on  sessionStorage  and localStorage.  20.6  Persisting Data Using a Relational Data Store Problem You want a more sophisticated data store on the client than what’s provided with other persistent storage methods, such as localStorage. You’d also like to use your mad SQL skills.  20.6  Persisting Data Using a Relational Data Store  479   Solution You can use SQL in client applications, with some significant limitations. There is a W3C Web SQL Database Working Draft for using a relational database such as SQLite on the client, but support for the specification is provided only in WebKit browsers  Safari and Chrome  and the latest Opera  10.5 : You can create a database:  var db = openDatabase "dbname","1.0", "Bird Database", 1024 * 1024 ;  and you can create tables, within a transaction:  db.transaction function tx   {    tx.executeSQL 'CREATE TABLE birdTable birdid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, birdname VARCHAR 20  NOT NULL ' ;  Then query on the tables:  db.transation function tx   {    tx.executeSQL 'SELECT * birdTable', [], sqlFunction, sqlError ;  var sqlFunction = function tx,recs  {    var rows = recs.rows;    for  var i = 0; i < rows.length; i++  {       alert recs.rows.item i .text ; }  Discussion I hesitated to cover the Web SQL Database specification because the implementation is limited, and the specification is currently blocked at the W3C. Only WebKit  and Chrome and Safari  and Opera have made any progress with this implementation, and there’s no guarantee that Mozilla or Microsoft will pick up on it, especially since the specification is blocked. It is an interesting concept, but it has significant problems. One is security, naturally. In our current applications, the client part of the applications handles one form of security, and the server component handles the other, including database security and protection against SQL injection: attaching text on to a data field value that actually triggers a SQL command—such as drop all tables, or expose private data. Now, with client-side relational database support, we’re introducing a new set of security concerns on the client. Another  concern  is  the  increasing  burden  we  put  on  client-side  storage.  Each  new innovation exposes new vulnerabilities, increases the size and complexity of our brows- ers, and embeds all sorts of data on our machines. Yet the vast majority of JavaScript applications don’t need to create their own version of Gmail, or a Photoshop-like paint program.  480  Chapter 20: Persistence   Then there’s the separation of a skill set. While it’s true that in small-to-medium shops, the  same  people  who  develop  the  frontend  application  probably  participate  in  the server-side development, it’s not unusual in many shops to have the tasks handled by different groups. So people who may not be terribly experienced at relational database management might be tossing around SQL transactions  and believe me, relational database application development is a dedicated skill . From an implementation point of view, only SQLite is currently supported. One dif- ference in implementations, if you have worked with server-side SQL applications, is that client-side SQL is asynchronous by default. This means your application is not blocked until the transaction completes, which provides its own challenge. However, there’s nothing wrong with playing around with something new. If you’re interested, pick up a browser that supports the functionality and give it a shot. However, I would avoid production use until we’re sure this technology is going to have a life beyond 2010.

Sure, you can learn Java or PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET, or any other programming environment or language, but one thing all these options share is that eventually, one way or another, you’ll probably need to use JavaScript. JavaScript is fun, too. You have to spend a considerable amount of time working on architecture issues and setup issues in many of the other environments, but all you need with JavaScript is a browser and a text-editing tool. When I say you can go from opening your text editor to your first real JavaScript application in five minutes, I’m not exag- gerating. Take the following file:       Blank           Add the following script after the title element:    alert "Wow, that was easy!" ;    Open the page in any browser, and you’re done. The only thing simpler in application development would be direct thought transference. In the first 20 chapters of this book, I covered how to use JavaScript primarily to build standard web applications, but that’s only part of the JavaScript story. JavaScript is an important component of major frameworks such as Microsoft’s Silverlight, as well as desktop development environments, such as Adobe AIR. JavaScript and JSON are the baseline functionality for Apache’s new CouchDB, which features a JSON-enabled da- tabase and query engine.  483   JavaScript is also used in many different applications and development environments, some of which are only indirectly related to typical web page functionality. In this chapter, I’m going to provide a sampling of out-of-the-box JavaScript uses that exist today, touching on some of the more popular. By the time you’re done with the chapter, you’ll understand why every developer needs to know JavaScript.  Wikipedia’s page on JavaScript includes one section titled “Uses outside web pages,” which can be a good resource for seeing how JavaScript can be used for something other than web applications.  21.1  Creating a Browser Add-0n, Plug-in, or Extension Problem You have an idea that would make a good browser add-on, plug-in, or extension, but you want to leverage your JavaScript skills to make the application. Solution Use the browser’s plug-in SDK, Extension API, or other packaged functionality that lets you use JavaScript to create the application. Discussion Not all browsers provide a relatively simple way to create browser add-ons, plug-ins, or extensions. Opera doesn’t provide this functionality at all, and WebKit’s plug-in architecture isn’t trivial. However, if you’re motivated, you should be able to use your JavaScript skills to create any number of useful browser tools.  Creating Google Chrome extensions A Google Chrome extension is the simplest development environment of all the brows- ers. Your extension can consist of a manifest file, created in JSON, a download icon, and then the extension web page and JavaScript. It’s uncomplicated, and it’s the envi- ronment I recommend you try first, before developing an extension for other browsers. You  can  run  through  the  beginning  tutorial  and  have  your  first  Chrome  extension finished in an hour. If, I should add, you can run Chrome in your environment at all, as Google also provides limited  platform  support  for  its  browser.  Currently,  the  Google  Chrome  extension environment only seems to work in Windows, though you can see about getting into an early release program for Mac and Linux. Note that Chrome’s Mac support is for Intel-based machines only.  484  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   If you can work with Chrome, your extension begins with a manifest file that uses JSON and looks like:  You’ll provide an extension name and description, provide the environments in which you’ll work  “permissions” , such as Google or Flickr, and provide browser actions to load pages or add icons. The popup.html file for my first extension has a style section and a script section:  {   "name": "Hello World",   "version": "1.0",   "description": "Giving this a try",   "browser_action": {     "default_icon": "icon.png",   "popup" : "popup.html"   } }    body {   min-width:357px;   overflow-x:hidden;   background-color:  ff0000;   color: ffff00;   font-weight: bold;   font-size: 48px; }       window.onload=function  {   var txt = document.createTextNode "Hello World!" ;   var div = document.createElement "div" ;   div.appendChild txt ;   document.body.appendChild div ; }    After you create the manifest and application page, you’ll load the extension in Chrome via the Tools menu, choosing Extensions. Make sure the Developer Tools are exposed, and click the “Load unpacked extension…” button for the extension folder, as shown in Figure 21-1. If all goes well, the icon shows in the toolbar. If you click the icon, the extension pop-up should open, as shown in Figure 21-2.  Access  the  Google  Chrome  Extension  Lab  at  http:  code.google.com  chrome extensions overview.html.  21.1  Creating a Browser Add-0n, Plug-in, or Extension  485   Figure 21-1. Loading a Chrome extension Mozilla extensions The  Mozilla  extensions  for  the  organization’s  applications,  including  Firefox  and Thunderbird, are reasonably uncomplicated to create, but even then, the number of files you need in order to implement an add-on is a little awe-inspiring. To assist the new extension developer, Mozilla provides a section on extensions, in- cluding how to set up a development environment, what all of the files mean, and what you need to bring your application together. There is also an Extension Wizard, which can simplify your work. The functionality for your Firefox add-on is going to be based, in part, on JavaScript, though the environment may not be one you recognize. For instance, your extension could consist of an XPCOM component, which has to be compiled using the Gecko SDK. Robert Nyman provided probably one of the cleanest tutorials on creating a Firefox extension, including a no-nonsense description of what files are needed, and where they are located. Once you plow through all of the files, you’ll find a JavaScript code listing. Though the objects in the code are unfamiliar, the coding is not.  486  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   Figure 21-2.

Creating a Greasemonkey script Greasemonkey is a popular Firefox extension that simplifies the process of building new functionality for the browser. Rather than going through the entire extension- building process, you can create a Greasemonkey script using JavaScript, and not have to worry about XUL, XPCOM, or intimidating file structures.  Mozilla recently released the first milestone release of the Jetpack SDK, providing a simpler environment for creating Firefox extensions. Read more about it and download the SDK at http:  mozillalabs.com jetpack  2010 03 09 announcing-the-jetpack-sdk .  21.1  Creating a Browser Add-0n, Plug-in, or Extension  487   A Greasemonkey script has a metadata section, which provides information about the script. Following the metadata section is the application functionality. Here’s an ex- ample of the beginning of a Greasemonkey script, from the popular YouTube Enhancer Greasemonkey script:     @name     YouTube Enhancer    @author    GIJoe    @license    CC  by-nc-sa    @include   http:  *.youtube.* *    @include   http:  userscripts.org scripts show 33402*  This partial list of the metadata describes the name of the script and the author, provides copyright information, and also several include rules. The include and exclude rules determine if the script is run or not. If the include dependency isn’t met, the script isn’t run; similarly, if what’s listed in the exclude rule is met, the script isn’t run. This pre- vents  running  of  script  where  it  does  no  good,  or  may  conflict  with  other applications. The code, though, is very familiar. The following is a snippet from the UnShortEmAll Greasemonkey script, which unshortens the shortened URLs in Twitter:  var as = document.getElementsByTagName 'a' ; for  var i = 0; i < as.length; i++  {    var a = as[i];    if  isshort a   {       unshorten a ;    } } ... function unshorten short_link  {    GM_xmlHttpRequest  {        method: "HEAD",        url: short_link, href,        headers: {"User-Agent": "Mozilla 5.0", "Accept": "text xml"},        onload: function response  {                        short_link.href=response.finalUrl;        }    } ; }  The code looks familiar. What’s different is the objects, and how the objects are used. However, we’ve used libraries before, and the objects are intuitive.  Download Greasemonkey from Greasespot.

Solution Use a widget development toolset. Discussion The world is widget-crazy, and rightfully so. Rather than large cumbersome multipur- pose applications, a widget is a small, friendly little bit of single-purpose functionality that is easy on our eyes, wallets, and computer resources. Widgets are especially attuned to the mobile environment, requiring little space and providing simple or no required interaction—they just work, as the saying goes. More importantly, widgets make use of existing technology, including HTML and JavaScript, and minimize the esoteric file structures endemic to browser extensions and full-blown phone applications. Widgets can be defined for a specific environment, such as the desktop, or can easily migrate from desktop to mobile. The difference is the toolset used.  Microsoft also supports HTML-based widgets in Vista and Windows 7  http:  www.microsoft.com windows windows-vista features sidebar -gadgets.aspx . Yahoo! has a nice summary of desktop widgets at http:   widgets.yahoo.net blog ?p=16.  Developing Mac Dashboard widgets Widgets came into their own when Apple released the Mac Dashboard, an environment conducive to embedding small, single-purpose applications. Currently on my Mac’s Dashboard, I have a weather widget, a clock, a calendar, and a countdown timer. Some I downloaded, some I made. The best environment for building Dashboard widgets is to use Apple’s Dashcode, which comes bundled with Xcode 3.0 and up. Dashboard comes prebuilt with tem- plates  you  can  select  from  in  order  to  short-cut  the  widget  development  effort.  As Figure 21-3 shows, there are a lot of different widget templates. Once you’ve picked a template, you’ll get a project interface where you can change the widget attributes, mark off completed workflow items, modify the graphics, include a widget icon, and package the whole thing. You can also add in JavaScript and see the existing script by clicking the View→Source Code menu option.  21 2  Creating Desktop and Mobile Widgets   489   Figure 21-3. Choosing a Dashboard widget template  At any time in the development process, you can run the widget to see how it looks, as shown in Figure 21-4 with a little book draft countdown widget I created. Notice the JavaScript in the window in the background. You can also use Dashcode to create a mobile Safari application.  Dashcode is installed with the XCode tool set, which you can either install from your Mac discs or access from http:  developer.apple.com.  The Opera Widgets development environment Opera doesn’t have an add-on or extension API SDK, but it does have a very nice widget development environment. This isn’t surprising when you consider Opera’s focus on its very popular mobile browser. However, you can also run Opera widgets as stand- alone desktop applications, as long as Opera 10.2 or higher is installed somewhere on your computer. Beginning with Opera 10.5, the widgets install as first-class citizens  like a regular application .  490  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   Figure 21-4. A snapshot of an in-progress Dashboard widget project  Building an Opera widget is little different than building any other widget: you create an HTML file for the widget, add script, a CSS stylesheet, and a configuration file  in XML  to manage the packaging of the widget. Opera widgets can be downloaded and installed and given chrome—more like an application than a widget. I created a simple Opera widget, but instead of the traditional Hello World, decided to print the date and time. I also added widget-like behavior to flip the widget when the front is clicked, in order to show the back, and to return. The HTML file is simple, and includes stylesheet and script inline:               Date Time              body       {           background-color: 006600;           color: ffff00;           font-weight: bold;           font-size: 24px;  21 2  Creating Desktop and Mobile Widgets   491         }       span       {           padding: 10px;       }       p a       {         color: fff;       }                   window.addEventListener "load", function    {               print out date            var dt = new Date  ;            var dtStr = dt.toDateString  ;            document.getElementById "date" .innerHTML=dtStr;                time            var timeStr = dt.toTimeString  ;            document.getElementById "time" .innerHTML=timeStr;          }, false ;                                   One very nice thing about developing for a specific browser and environment, is you don’t  have  to  worry  about  cross-browser  support,  and  can  use  something  like addEventListener for the window load event without worrying about IE. I could have also split the style into a stylesheet and the script into a script file—separate or inline, makes no difference. The  config.xml  file  is  also  simple,  just  providing  some  basic  information  about  the widget and the widget author:         Date and Time     Prints out current date and time     440     200           Shelley Powers       shelleyp@burningbird.net       http:  burningbird.net       Burningbird               burningbid.net       DateTime       2010-03   492  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box          To  package  the  widget,  all  we  need  do  is  zip  it  up  and  change  the  file  extension to  .wgt.  When  downloaded  and  double-clicked,  the  widget  is  installed  and  run,  as shown in Figure 21-5.  Figure 21-5. My little Opera widget on my Mac desktop  Of course, this is a simple widget, without chrome  which can be added , or controls  ditto , and it doesn’t update the time with a timer. But it does demonstrate how simple it can be to create a working widget. There are any number of widget SDKs and instructions for making both desktop and mobile widgets. Among those I thought most interesting are the following:    The Opera Widget Developer Community.   The  W3C’s  Widget  Packaging  and  Configuration  specification  is  in  Candidate  Recommendation state.    The Yahoo! Konfabulator SDK. The site also provides a widget converter.   Microsoft has provided a how-to on creating widgets for Windows Mobile 6.5.  Windows Mobile 7 should be released towards the end of 2010.  21 2  Creating Desktop and Mobile Widgets   493     The Mobile Safari Web Application Tutorial at Apple.

Solution For  many  different  platforms,  including  the  iPhone,  Android,  and  BlackBerry,  use PhoneGap to create the application with HTML and JavaScript,. Discussion Smart phone development requires a commitment of both time and money. No matter how clever the tools you use, you’ll need to test your application in a real device, and therein lies the cost. In addition, setting up the development environment and becom- ing familiar with the SDKs and plug-ins, as well as with PhoneGap, is not a trivial undertaking. However, smart phone applications are a hot commodity now, as well as an interesting environment, and can be worth both the time and the cost. PhoneGap provides a way to develop an application once in HTML and JavaScript, and port that application to the three smart phone environments: iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry  and Windows Mobile, Palm, and so on . What it doesn’t provide is a way to work around any environment restrictions, such as having to have a Mac Intel machine in order to develop for the iPhone. If you don’t have a Mac Intel machine, though, you can still try out the tool for other phones, even if at first you don’t have the phones for testing. PhoneGap provides an emulator, as does Android and BlackBerry. BlackBerry provides a variety of simulators for every type of device. You’ll need to install the Eclipse development environment, but this application is freely available for most environments. You’ll also need to download either the BlackBerry or Android SDKs, and or Eclipse plug-ins. It does take a nontrivial amount of time getting to know the environments, the files, and how everything holds together. Once you’ve met these background requirements, you’re back on familiar ground: us- ing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For instance, the following code snippet  from the  494  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   book Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, by Jonathan Stark, pub- lished by O’Reilly  demonstrates using jQuery for building an iPhone application:  if  window.innerWidth && window.innerWidth <= 480  {      $ document .ready function  {         $ 'header ul' .addClass 'hide' ;         $ 'header' .append '<div class="leftButton"             onclick="toggleMenu  ">Menu ' ;     } ;     function toggleMenu   {         $ 'header ul' .toggleClass 'hide' ;         $ 'header .leftButton' .toggleClass 'pressed' ;     } }  As you can see, once you get past all of the framework issues, the JavaScript is little different than what you use for your web applications. See Also Download  PhoneGap  and  find  the  help  wiki  at  http:  phonegap.com .  You  can  also separately download the PhoneGap emulator, which runs on Adobe AIR. I found the emulator to be helpful when it came to debugging how my many websites look on various mobile devices. Another helpful tool for jQuery development for the iPhone is jQTouch, a jQuery plug- in  developed  by  David  Kaneda  to  simplify  converting  HTML  pages  into  iPhone applications. The plug-in comes with prebuilt animations, as well as event handling specific to iPhones, such as swipe detection. You can download the plug-in and see documentation at http:  www.jqtouch.com . Jonathan Stark provides a how-to tutorial on using jQTouch on YouTube at http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=6X4K2MQsSeI. Eclipse  can  be  downloaded  from  http:  www.eclipse.org.  The  Android  development environment  can  be  found  at  http:  developer.android.com sdk index.html,  and  the BlackBerry at http:  na.blackberry.com eng developers . If you have the bucks to ensure you have the development machine, the iPhone devel- opment center is at http:  developer.apple.com iphone . If you are interested in iPhone development, I recommend Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Jonathan Stark  O’Reilly . Jonathan provides a chapter on using PhoneGap for iPhone development.  21.3  Creating JavaScript Applications for the iPhone, Android, and BlackBerry with PhoneGap  495   21.4  Enhancing Tools with JavaScript Problem You have a favorite tool, such as Photoshop or Adobe Bridge, or a favorite application, such as OpenOffice. You want to add an extension or macro that takes a set of behaviors written in JavaScript and integrates it into the product. Solution A quick search online is going to show if you can extend your favorite tools, utilities, and applications with JavaScript. In most cases, you already have the tools you need. Discussion When  we  hear  JavaScript,  we  think  web,  and  forget  that  JavaScript  is  a  compact, easy-to-learn  language  being  incorporated  as  the  basic  scripting  language  for  many applications. In this section, we’ll look at how JavaScript can be used to extend, enhance, or package reusable functionality, and then be integrated into two different applications.  Working with the Adobe Bridge SDK and the ExtendScript Toolkit JavaScript can be used with the Adobe Creative Suite  CS  products, using the Adobe Bridge SDK and the ExtendScript Toolkit  ESTK  that’s installed with the Suite. There are SDKs currently available for CS3 and CS4. You can use any editor for the JavaScript, but the ESTK allows you to build and test within the environment in which the scripts run. The easiest way to get started with writing scripts for the Creative Suite products is to open it and take a close look at the samples provided with the SDK and Creative Suite installations, most likely under a subdirectory labeled Scripting Guide. Both the SDK and the CS come with extensive documentation. For the Adobe Bridge SDK, the JavaScript samples are located in the sdksamples java- script subdirectory. I picked one called ColorPicker.jsx, and double-clicked the file to open it within the ESTK, as shown in Figure 21-6. The Photoshop script files have a specialized ESTK file extension, .jsx, but they contain regular JavaScript. The sample code is well documented and easy to follow. Utilizing the advice in the CS3 Scripting Guide, I created a PhotoShop version of Hello World with the following JavaScript:     Remember current unit settings and then set units to    the value expected by this script var originalUnit = preferences.rulerUnits preferences.rulerUnits = Units.INCHES  496  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box      Create a new 2x4 inch document and assign it to a variable var docRef = app.documents.add  8, 8       Create a new art layer containing text var artLayerRef = docRef.artLayers.add   artLayerRef.kind = LayerKind.TEXT     Set the contents of the text layer. var textItemRef = artLayerRef.textItem textItemRef.contents = "Hello, World from Shelley!"     Release references docRef = null artLayerRef = null textItemRef = null     Restore original ruler unit setting app.preferences.rulerUnits = originalUnit  Figure 21-6. Opening the ColorPicker JavaScript file in the ExtendScript Toolkit  I saved the file as helloworld.jsx in the CS3 Photoshop→Presets→Scripts subdirectory, and  when  I  started  Photoshop  and  selected  File→Scripts,  my  helloworld  script  was displayed in the menu that opened. Clicking it opened a very plain document with my simple message.  21.4  Enhancing Tools with JavaScript   497   As you can see, the JavaScript is simple, but you do have to spend a significant amount of time becoming familiar with the Adobe CS environment and objects.  You can download the Adobe Bridge SDK from the Photoshop Devel oper Center.  Creating an OpenOffice macro Most office-like tools provide some form of extensibility, though not all applications allow JavaScript. OpenOffice, which is the tool I’m using to write this book, allows us to write macros using JavaScript within the ScriptingFramework architecture. A JavaScript macro is created in its own subdirectory, with a parcel-descriptor.xml file providing a descriptor for the macro. A very simple example is my own modified version of the Hello World JavaScript macro that is installed with Open Office. The descriptor looks as follows:  ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>                                                                 Adds the the string "Hello World, from Shelley!" into the current text doc.                                                         Hello World in JavaScript importClass Packages.com.sun.star.uno.UnoRuntime ; importClass Packages.com.sun.star.text.XTextDocument ; importClass Packages.com.sun.star.text.XText ; importClass Packages.com.sun.star.text.XTextRange ;    get the document from the scripting context oDoc = XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getDocument  ;    get the XTextDocument interface xTextDoc = UnoRuntime.queryInterface XTextDocument,oDoc ;    get the XText interface  498  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box  Pretty simple and intuitive: a display name, a description, the function name  which is the filename , and a logical name. The JavaScript is almost as simple:   xText = xTextDoc.getText  ;    get an  empty  XTextRange interface at the end of the text xTextRange = xText.getEnd  ;    set the text in the XTextRange xTextRange.setString  "Hello World, from Shelley!"  ;  All  macros  have  access  to  the  OpenOffice  API  through  the  XScriptContext  object, shown highlighted in the code snippet, which provides an interface between the macro and the OpenOffice documents. Once both of the files were created, I uploaded my macro subdirectory to the Open- Office  macro  subdirectory,  and  when  I  clicked  on  Tools→Macros→Organize Macros→JavaScript,  the  dialog  opened,  showing  my  newly  installed  Macro,  as  in Figure 21-7.  Figure 21-7. OpenOffice dialog showing my newly created JavaScript macro  Running the macro creates a line of text in the top of the document that says, “Hello World from Shelley!” Simple, true, but the line could have easily contained the typical header for all of your letters, preformatted and ready to insert into the page by clicking a key that is bound to the macro.  21.4  Enhancing Tools with JavaScript   499   The OpenOffice Writing Macros page can be found at http:  wiki.serv ices.openoffice.org wiki Documentation DevGuide Scripting Writing _Macros.  21.5  Creating Efficient Desktop Applications with Web Workers and the File API Problem You’re interested in adding the necessary functionality so that your browser-based on- line application can function as a full-featured desktop application. Solution In addition to using many of the other technologies covered earlier in the book, add four  new  capabilities  to  your  JavaScript CSS HTML-based  application:  application cache, so your site can function offline; geolocation, if your application is mobile-based; direct  file  access  through  the  File  API;  and  Web  Workers,  for  efficient  concurrent processing. Application cache isn’t JavaScript-specific, and the geolocation API requires specialized equipment for testing, so I’m going to focus on the File API and Web Workers in this recipe. Discussion The File API bolts on to the existing input element file type, used for file uploading. In addition to the capability of uploading the file to the server via a form upload, you can now access the file directly in JavaScript, and either work with it locally or upload the file using the XMLHttpRequest object. There are three objects in the File API:  FileList  File  FileReader  A list of files to upload via input type="file".  Information about a specific file.  Object to asynchronously upload the file for client-side access.  Each of the objects has associated properties and events, including being able to track the progress of a file upload  and provide a custom progress bar , as well as signaling when the upload is finished. The File object can provide information about the file, including file size and MIME type. The FileList object provides a list of File objects,  500  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   because more than one file can be specified if the input element has the multiple at- tribute set. The FileReader is the object that does the actual file upload. Example 21-1 is an application that uses all three objects in order to upload a file as text, and embed the text into the web page. In the example, I’m using it to access uncompressed ePub book chapters. Since ePub chapter files are valid XHTML, I can use the built-in XML Parser object, DOMParser, to process the file.  Example 21-1. Uploading an ePub chapter into a web page       ePub Reader      result {   width: 500px;   margin: 30px; }      window.onload=function   {  function handleFiles   {   var fileList = this.files;   var reader = new FileReader  ;   reader.onload = loadFile;   reader.readAsText fileList[0] ; }  function loadFile   {    var inputElement = document.getElementById "file" ;   inputElement.addEventListener "change", handleFiles, false ; }       look for the body section of the document   var parser = new DOMParser  ;   var xml = parser.parseFromString this.result,"text xml" ;   var content = xml.getElementsByTagName "body" ;       if found, extract the body element's innerHTML   if  content.length > 0  {      var ct = content[0].innerHTML;      var title = document.getElementById "bookTitle" .value;      title = " " + title + " ";      document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = title + ct;   } }        21 5  Creating Efficient Desktop Applications with Web Workers and the File API   501      Title:       File:             Figure 21-8 shows the page with a chapter of one of my books loaded.  Figure 21-8. Using the File API to read a chapter of an ePub book  The File API is still a work in progress, and only Firefox 3.6 and up support it. However, it’s an intriguing functionality that’s also necessary for an application to be considered a “desktop” application—if you want to be able to upload and work with files when your application is currently offline. It’s also pretty handy for other uses.  502  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   The File API is a W3C effort. You can read the latest draft at http:  www .w3.org TR FileAPI . Read Mozilla’s coverage at https:  developer.mozil la.org en Using_files_from_web_applications.  The last new technology I’m going to cover in this book is Web Workers. Before I get into the new functionality, though, I want to provide a brief introduction to multi- threaded development. In a language such as Java, you can create multiple threads of execution, which can operate concurrently. Computers and operating systems have long had the ability to support multiple threads, switching the necessary resources among the threads as nee- ded, demonstrated in Figure 21-9. Handled correctly, threads can make your applica- tion  run  faster  and  more  efficiently.  Multithreaded  development  also  provides  the functionality necessary to ensure the threads are synced, so the applications are accu- rate, too.  Figure 21-9. Example of concurrent threads, from the Thread Wikipedia entry  In the past, a major difference between JavaScript and these multithreaded program- ming languages is that JavaScript runs within a single thread of execution. Even when a timer fires, the associated event falls into the same queue as other pending events. This single-execution-thread queue is why you can’t absolutely depend on the precise- ness of a JavaScript timer. With Web Workers, introduced as one of the W3C WebApps 1.0 specifications, for better or worse, this all changes.  21 5  Creating Efficient Desktop Applications with Web Workers and the File API   503   I say “for better or worse” because thread-based development has always been a two- edged  sword  in  most  development  environments.  If  they’re  not  properly  managed, multithreaded applications can crash and burn rather spectacularly. Of course, with most of the other multithreaded environments, you also have more control over the creation and destruction of threads. Web Workers provides threaded development, but at a higher, hopefully safer level. To create a web worker, all you need do is call the Worker object constructor, passing in the URI for a script file to run:  var theWorker = new Worker "background.js" ;  You  can  also  assign  a  function  to  the  web  worker’s  onmessage  event  handler,  and onerror event handler:  theWorker.onmessage = handleMessage; theWorker.onerror = handleError;  To communicate with the web worker, use the postMessage method, providing any data it needs:  theWorker.postMessage dataObject ;  In the web worker, an onmessage event handler receives this message, and can extract the data from the event object:  onmessage event  {    var data = event.data;    ... }  If the web worker needs to pass data back, it also calls postMessage. The function to receive the message in the main application is the event handler function assigned to the web worker’s onmessage event handler:  theWorker.onmessage= handleMessage;  The function can extract any data it’s expecting from the event object. Normally the script you’d run would be a computationally intensive script, with results that aren’t immediately needed. Mozilla’s example for web workers demonstrates a script that computes a Fibonacci sequence. It reminded me of the recursive function I demonstrated in Chapter 6, the one that reversed arrays. In Example 21-2, I converted the reversed array function into a web worker JavaScript routine. In the JavaScript library, an onmessage event handler function accesses the data from the event object—the array to reverse—and passes it to the reversed array func- tion. Once the function finishes, the web worker routine calls postMessage, sending the resulting string back to the main application.  504  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   Example 21-2. Using web worker JavaScript to reverse an array and return the resulting string     web worker thread - reverses array onmessage = function event  {     var reverseArray = function x,indx,str  {       return indx == 0 ? str : reverseArray x,--indx, str+= " " + x[indx]  ;;    }        reverse array    var str = reverseArray event.data, event.data.length, "" ;        return resulting string to main application    postMessage str ; };  I copied and modified the application in Example 21-1 to Example 21-3. When the application retrieves the uploaded file and extracts the body element, it splits the content into an array based on the space character. The application sends the array through to the reversed array web worker. Once the web worker finishes, the data is retrieved and output to the page.  Example 21-3. The ePub reader in Example 21-1, using a web worker to reverse the content       ePub Reader      result {   width: 500px;   margin: 30px; }      window.onload=function   {    var inputElement = document.getElementById "file" ;   inputElement.addEventListener "change", handleFiles, false ; }  function handleFiles   {   var fileList = this.files;   var reader = new FileReader  ;   reader.onload = loadFile;   reader.readAsText fileList[0] ; }  function loadFile   {       look for the body section of the document   var parser = new DOMParser  ;  21 5  Creating Efficient Desktop Applications with Web Workers and the File API   505     var xml = parser.parseFromString this.result,"text xml" ;   var content = xml.getElementsByTagName "body" ;       if found, extract the body element's innerHTML   if  content.length > 0  {      var ct = content[0].innerHTML;      var ctarray = ct.split " " ;      var worker = new Worker "reverse.js" ;      worker.onmessage=receiveResult;      worker.postMessage ctarray ;   } }  function receiveResult event  {      document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = event.data; }          File:             As you can see in Figure 21-10, the results are interesting. Not very useful—except they demonstrate that the web worker performs as expected, and quickly, too. Firefox 3.6 is the only browser that supports both File API and Web Workers at the time this was written. WebKit, and WebKit-based browsers, Safari and Chrome, sup- port Web Workers. To test the result in the WebKit browsers, I converted the main application to work on a statically created array, rather than an uploaded file:  window.onload=function   {    var ctarray = ["apple","bear","cherries","movie"];   var worker = new Worker "reverse.js" ;   worker.onmessage=receiveResult;   worker.postMessage ctarray ; }  function receiveResult event  {      document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = event.data; }  I ran the application in Firefox and then in Safari, and ended up with unexpected results, as shown in Figure 21-11. The Firefox results are what I would expect: the array entries are reversed, and the entries converted to a string. The result from Safari, though, is unexpected: every char- acter within the string is reversed, including the commas between the array elements.  506  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   Figure 21-10. Reversed array from uploaded file displayed in page  Running the application again, but this time in the newest WebKit nightly build, the results match the Firefox result. What happened with Safari 4 is that postMessage didn’t serialize the object correctly when it transmitted the object to the web worker routine. The newer WebKit nightly shows that this bug was fixed, and the object is now seri- alized correctly. However, to ensure that objects are passed correctly, regardless of browser version, we can use JSON.stringify on any object before we send it, and JSON.parse on any data that we receive, in order to ensure the object is handled correctly regardless of browser and browser version:  window.onload=function   {    var ctarray = ["apple","bear","cherries","movie"];   var worker = new Worker "reverse2.js" ;   worker.onmessage=receiveResult;   worker.postMessage JSON.stringify ctarray  ; }  21 5  Creating Efficient Desktop Applications with Web Workers and the File API   507   function receiveResult event  {      document.getElementById "result" .innerHTML = event.data; }  In the web worker, we use JSON.parse to restore the serialized version of the object:     web worker thread - reverses array onmessage = function event  {     var reverseArray = function x,indx,str  {       return indx == 0 ? str : reverseArray x,--indx, str+= " " + x[indx]  ;;    }        reverse array    var obj = JSON.parse event.data ;    var str = reverseArray obj, obj.length, "" ;        return resulting string to main application    postMessage str ; };  Figure 21-11. Interesting—and differing—results when running application in Firefox and Safari  Now the application works the same in Firefox 3.6 and Safari 4. The application should also work with Chrome. Web workers don’t work with Opera 10.5, or IE8. However, both browsers should support web workers, and hopefully the File API, in an upcoming version.  508  Chapter 21: JavaScript Outside the Box   See Also See  Recipe  6.6  for  a  description  of  the  array  reversal  recursive  function.

Her recent O’Reilly books have covered the semantic web, Ajax, JavaScript, and web graphics. She’s an avid amateur photographer and web development aficionado.  Colophon The animal on the cover of JavaScript Cookbook is a little  or lesser  egret  Egretta garzetta . A small white heron, it is the old world counterpart to the very similar new world snowy egret. It is the smallest and most common egret in Singapore, and its original breeding distribution included the large inland and coastal wetlands in warm temperate parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, Taiwan, and Australia. In warmer locations, most birds are permanent residents; northern populations, including many European birds,  migrate  to  Africa  and  southern  Asia.  They  may  also  wander  north  after  the breeding season, which presumably has led to this egret’s range expansion. The adult Little Egret is 55–65 cm long with an 88–106 cm wingspan. It weighs 350– 550 grams. Its plumage is all white. It has long black legs with yellow feet and a slim black bill. In the breeding season, the adult has two long nape plumes and gauzy plumes on the back and breast, and the bare skin between its bill and eyes becomes red or blue. Juvenile egrets are similar to nonbreeding adults but have duller legs and feet. Little egrets are the liveliest hunters among herons and egrets, with a wide variety of techni- ques: they may patiently stalk prey in shallow waters; stand on one leg and stir the mud with the other to scare up prey; or, better yet, stand on one leg and wave the other bright yellow foot over the water’s surface to lure aquatic prey into range. The birds are mostly silent, but make various croaking and bubbling calls at their breeding col- onies and produce a harsh alarm call when disturbed. The little egret nests in colonies, often with other wading birds, usually on platforms of sticks in trees or shrubs, in reed beds, or in bamboo groves. In some locations, such as the Cape Verde Islands, the species nests on cliffs. In pairs they will defend a small breeding territory. Both parents will incubate their 3–5 eggs for 21–25 days until hatch- ing. The eggs are oval in shape and have a pale, nonglossy, blue-green color. The young birds are covered in white down feathers, are cared for by both parents, and fledge after 40 to 45 days. During this stage, the young egret stalks its prey in shallow water, often running with raised wings or shuffling its feet. It may also stand still and wait to ambush prey. It eats fish, insects, amphibians, crustaceans, and reptiles. The cover image is from Cassell’s Natural History. The cover font is Adobe ITC Gara- mond.

In developing mid to large scale web applications nowadays, it's a common practice to leverage JavaScript frameworks such as Prototype, Scriptaculous and JQuery. As the author of JavaScript Cookbook points out, "in order to use a framework library like jQuery to its best ability, you need to understand what's happening under the hood." JavaScript Cookbook provides a good amount of information on the fundamental and new features of JavaScript. For example, the book covers ECMAScript 5 features (e.g., Array object methods "forEach", "map" and "filter") with concrete use scenarios in the format of classic "cookbook" receipts, accompanied with snippets of code in the context. Through different receipts, to depict the fast evolving landscape of front-end development, the book covers eye-catching topics such as HTML5 API such as "drag-and-drop", "web worker", filesystem access, as well as creating mobile widgets and native smart phone applications with HTML/JavaScript using open source translation tools
