So avoid compulsion and let your children’s lessons take the form of play. —Plato, The Republic  Through  play,  many  species’  young  acquire  the  necessary  skills  to navigate  their  world.  Play  is  how  they  learn,  make  mistakes,  and establish social and cultural norms. According to Thomas Henricks, in  his  essay  “The  Nature  of  Play,”  “Compared  to  those  moments when people are virtually prisoners of their daily routines, people at play  are  said  to  have  broken  free  to  conjure  new  possibilities  of being and, even more importantly, to test the implications of those possibilities in protected forms of behavior.” The last half century has seen the evolution of the computer from a monolithic counting machine to a ubiquitous network of small, pro‐ grammed  devices.  Processors  became  cheaper  and  connectivity became  universal.  Along  the  way,  toys  also  got  smart.  Today’s  $40 Furby  has  four  times  the  processing  power  as  the  1960’s  Apollo Moon Lander. Moore’s law explains that an increase in accessibility and decrease in cost leads to an exponential rise in all things elec‐ tronic year over year. Cheaper, more accessible technologies have fil‐ led the so-called need to enhance our productivity and quicken our communication,  but  technological  toys  have  not  actually  proven themselves  to  be  more  educational,  more  efficient,  or  more  enter‐ taining  than  “dumb”  building  blocks,  skipping  ropes,  or  even  the timeless cardboard box fort.  1   While  the  toy  industry  is  worth  $85  billion,  it’s  stalled  in  recent years. Smart toys are the exception, with analyst firm iDATE esti‐ mating their global market size growing from €1.3 billion in 2013 to more than €7 billion by 2018. This increase comes just in time, too. One of the growing trends in toys is what is known as the toys-to- life industry, comprised of games that combine smart toys and video games   e.g.,  Amiibo,  Skylanders,  and  Disney  Infinity .  The  market research company NPD Group states that about 28% of U.S. house‐ holds own at least one of these games. So  what’s  driving  the  increase  in  smart  toys?  Production  cost  and marketing is a big factor. Smart toys cost less to produce than they once did, and many often have flashy elements that are easier to sell. The toy industry has an expression: “Sell the sizzle, not the steak.” Technology in toys provides a new kind of sizzle, one that the con‐ sumer  market  finds  irresistible  despite  the  lack  of  evidence  that these toys are any better for children. Another big advantage for toy companies and startups alike is that smart  toys  require  a  software  ecosystem,  and  generally  some  data buy-in  from  parents  and  children.  This  means  that  unlike  tradi‐ tional  toys,  which  tend  to  either  be  outgrown  or  become  boring, there is a digital element in smart toys that has the potential to be updated  and  customized.  Combine  that  with  the  personal  invest‐ ment necessary to “teach” your Furby to talk, or create your func‐ tioning  Little  Bits  keyboard,  and  it  leads  to  a  much  lower abandonment rate; Technobuffalo states that only seven percent of families have lost interest in the toys after picking them up. Clearly, smart toys are the future of play. What, exactly, “smart toys” are is less clear. Laurent Michaud, Head of  Consumer  Electronics  &  Digital  Entertainment  Practice  at iDATE, defines smart toys as “a video game, one or more connected objects, and a distribution platform with a display.” One toy execu‐ tive, who agreed to be interviewed for this report on condition of anonymity, described smart toys as highly connected apps with tons of sensors, but conceded that many toys are not really “smart” at all. Toy and game developer Faran Thomason, with Jungle Cat Produc‐ tions, calls smart toys “the latest iteration of the ‘tech’ toy genre.” He adds, “They’re edutainment-type toys that can be upgraded or con‐ nected to the Internet.”  2     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   Data science is at the core of these smart toys. No longer limited to scripted responses, toys are now employing sophisticated algorithms to enable interactivity. They’re connecting to the cloud, sharing data, and  getting  updates.  They’re  customizable.  Smart  toys  are  also  a sandbox  for  new  technology  initiatives.  Special-purpose  AI  is  as likely  to  emerge  from  a  smart  toy  as  an  enterprise  application; immersive visualizations may just as easily come from a video game as from DARPA-funded research. This shift in the type of toy we’re manufacturing has important con‐ sequences for how we play, and how we learn. There’s a huge differ‐ ence  between  a  toy   unstructured,  unconditional   and  a  game  constrained  by  rules .  We  play  games  with  toys.  And  as  toys become connected and imbued with data, the freedom of play can vanish.  A  smart  toy  knows  how  it  wants  to  be  played,  and  so  it becomes the playmate. The feedback loops of smart toys, driven by data,  are  impacting  how  we  learn,  and  this  has  important  conse‐ quences for humans. Smart  toys  fundamentally  change  the  nature  of  play,  and  how  the next  generation  thinks  about  interaction—not  only  with  toys,  but with one another. The Nature of Play While  play  is  a  quintessential  part  of  childhood,  the  word  “play” describes a variety of activities enjoyed by people of every age. Play is not a specific activity or outcome; it’s more of a subjective feeling. Play  is  fun,  while  other  activities  can  be  tedious,  bothersome,  or downright unpleasant. We imply, in our division of daily activities, that play is somehow different than “work.” Yet many child research‐ ers, including Maria Montessori, describe play as the “work of child‐ hood.” Dimensions of Play According to Montessori, play includes the following dimensions: Play is voluntary  Whether sports, painting, or making music, play is an activity we enjoy and engage in willingly. How many of us, as children, were told to “go play outside” after annoying our parents for a bit too long? Although we do not always seek play, it is some‐  The Nature of Play      3   thing  we  pursue  with  happiness  when  we  find  it.  This  is  an important  point  where  technological  toys  are  concerned.  For example,  a  toy  like  Dash  and  Dot,  which  encourages  kids  to write  programming  code,  turns  software  development  into “play,” where writing software code might be considered work in another context.  Play expands skills  Particularly  in  young  children,  play  tends  to  draw  the  player into  situations  that  require  the  use  of  existing  skills,  or  the learning of new skills. This is readily apparent in sporting activi‐ ties, but can also be observed in creative play like visual or per‐ forming  arts  and  role-playing.  Large  and  small  motor  skills, communication,  and  memory  are  a  just  few  of  the  skills  we refine over time through play.  Play expands new ideas  We  often  perform  experiments  when  we  play,  inventing  con‐ traptions, staging complicated interactions, and exploring new places, both physically and figuratively. Role-playing and com‐ petitive  games  allow  children  to  safely  explore  their  roles  in society,  personal  relationships,  and  expectations  of  cause  and effect.  These  are  some  of  the  complex  ideas  that  children develop while they’re young.  Play is social  Obviously, you can play by yourself. But unlike sleep, work, or reading a book, play is a social interaction. Solo play creates a feedback loop that provides a social reward. Whether you paint a  picture,  fly  a  kite,  or  spend  an  hour  on  a  swing  singing  to yourself, you are interacting with yourself in a social way, which helps you interact with others. Group play has more conspicu‐ ous social benefits.  Play is emotional  If it didn’t feel good, we wouldn’t do it. With the exception of professional athletes and artists, very few of us are paid to play. We  enjoy  playing.  It’s  also  a  survival  impulse  that  can  be observed in many young animals. The games and adventures we embark on as children lead us past our fear of the unknown into a  greater  awareness  of  the  world  and  its  pitfalls.  In  fact,  play often summons a combination of emotions—from fear and dis‐ appointment to excitement and happiness. Through games, we  4     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   learn to experience, express, and cope with a wide range of feel‐ ings.  Constraints and Rules Another cornerstone of play is constraint. Some forms of play are competitive,  and  those  constraints  become  rules—a  way  to  deter‐ mine  the  winner  and  loser.  Less  structured  play,  such  as  “playing house,” may be collaborative, with the only constraints being the set‐ ting and roles. Linda El-Fakir, president of The Big Idea Factory and serial  toy  entrepreneur,  compared  the  fluctuating  constraints  of smart toys with the somewhat fixed constraints of traditional toys. “Smart  toys  use  electronics  and  their  programming  to  guide  chil‐ dren  in  how  to  play  or  learn,  and  some  allow  growth  and  change over time with mastery; for example, they can move to a next level of  play,  select  more  types  of  play,  or  play  differently,”  said  Linda. “Traditional  toys  tend  to  have  set  play  patterns  and  can’t  change over  time,  but  can  be  played  with  as  intended  or  differently,  and with other toys—for example, blocks and action figures and vehicles together—depending on the child’s interest and imagination.” From  constraints  comes  creativity.  Constraints  provide  context,  as well as limitations to overcome. In the case of competitive play  e.g., chess or tag , the rules provide the basis for the contest. In creative play, these rules are often emergent, invented as play progresses. The Nature and Evolution of Toys “If play is the work of the child, toys are the tools,” said Maria Mon‐ tessori in an article for the Child Development Institute. “Through toys, children learn about their world, themselves, and others.” Per Montessori, toys teach children to:    Figure out how things work   Pick up new ideas   Build muscle control and strength   Use their imagination   Solve problems   Learn to cooperate with others  The Nature of Play      5   However, the nature of toys  and play  is in flux. In the last half cen‐ tury, toys stopped being tools for play, and became agents of play. All toys  offer  affordances—a  stick  might  be  a  weapon,  or  a  mode  of transport, or a musical instrument. A stick isn’t designed for any of these things, of course, but a child provides the necessary context. One  way  to  look  at  toys  is  to  consider  them  in  two  dimensions: whether the child is a spectator versus a creator, and whether the toy is being used for its intended purpose versus being repurposed  see Figure 1-1 .  Figure 1-1. Comparison of toys based on provided play narrative  Purpose-built toys have more constraints—ball wants to be thrown, a doll wants to be hugged, and a pen wants to draw. The more com‐ plex  the  toy,  think  today’s  smart  toys,  the  more  “opinions”  it  has about how it should be used. How Toys Became Smart The  brains  of  today’s  toys  started  with  arcade  video  games.  Early computer  games  were  the  digital  equivalent  of  board  games.  For example,  Pong   released  in  1972 ,  pitted  opponents  against  one another, without agency on the part of the game. These early games merely enforced the policies and constraints of the game. The next wave of games allowed single-player play, but they weren’t adaptive. Breakout  released in 1976  had no intelligence beyond a simulation  6     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   of  physics.  The  enemy  in  Space  Invaders   released  in  1978   didn’t adapt to player behavior, other than speeding up on more advanced levels.  As  games  became  more  sophisticated,  they  began  to  adjust their play in response to the player’s actions. The ghosts in Pac-Man  released  in  1980   changed  their  trajectories  according  to  how  the player moved. While  difficult  to  pinpoint,  the  emergence  of  “smart  toys”  likely started in the early 90s, with VTech and LeapFrog. These were the first big toy manufacturers to focus on the smart toy market, and to spread the message that digital toys offer superior educational expe‐ riences.  The  small  handheld  arcade  games  and  Tamagotchi  toys never  claimed  to  make  kids  smarter,  or  to  be  particularly  smart themselves. But LeapPad and other products were packaged with the message that they could actually teach kids with their built-in tech‐ nology. The idea that toys could also learn from kids came later, with toys like  Robosapien  and  Furby.  The  Tamagotchi’s  smart  companion Furby  required  care,  feeding,  and  interaction  with  an  owner.  This paved the way for even more advanced sidekicks, such as Jimmy the 21st century robot. In Alone Together  Basic Books , author Sherry Turkle writes, “The first  computational  objects  of  the  playroom  provoked  a  change  in children’s way of sorting out the question of aliveness. ... Unlike tra‐ ditional dolls, the robots wouldn’t thrive without attention, and they let you know how you were doing. But even the most primitive of these  objects—Tamagotchis  and  Furbies—made  children’s  evalua‐ tion of aliveness less about cognition than about an object’s seeming potential for mutual affection.” While  furry  dependents  and  charming  robots  were  hitting  the shelves, ubiquitous computing also became a reality. There are now billions of smartphones in the world, as well as microcontroller kits like Raspberry Pi and Arduino on which to build the brains of a toy. Many modern smart toys rely on ubiquitous broadband for every‐ thing from software updates to analytics to tie-ins between physical and virtual elements. In recent years, games have become even more sophisticated, with storylines  that  adjust  to  the  player’s  choices  and  behaviors,  and deeply  branched  conversations.  Games  like  Guitar  Hero,  which introduced a physical toy linked to a digital game, have blurred this  The Nature of Play      7   physical virtual line. And kid-friendly communities such as Disney’s Club  Penguin  and  shared  servers  for  sandbox  games  like  Arc  and Minecraft provide creative interaction. Powered by software, collecting data, and personalizing their actions based on the user, smart toys not only change how children learn, but also act as surrogates for intimacy and companionship. Play is largely about narrative, and when the toy comes with its own narra‐ tor, will it drown out the narrative of the child? From Opponent to Companion One of the many ways smart toys differ from traditional toys is that they can control the narrative of play. Their programming is hardly sentient—today it’s at the level of a non-player character  NPC  in a video game—but context will soon enable them to react algorithmi‐ cally, rather than programmatically. This interactivity is compelling. It’s why virtual toys are flourishing. Looking  at  automated  chat  programs  like  Cleverbot,  it’s  clear  that this future isn’t far off. Figure 1-2 shows an example chat with Clev‐ erbot.  8     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   Figure 1-2. Cleverbot chat example  Chat  agents  like  Cleverbot  learn  from  every  user,  often  parroting back  what  others  have  said.  In  this  example,  nearly  30,000  people are talking with Cleverbot. Its interactivity is a product of a constant feedback loop, just as Google Now learns from the searches its users conduct.  And  as  we’ll  see,  that  feedback  loop  holds  both  promise and risk for toys. Apps and the Soul of the Toy We  spend  a  tremendous  amount  of  time  in  front  of  screens.  Late 2014 was a tipping point, when, according to Flurry Analytics, the average  American  spent  168  minutes  a  day  watching  TV,  but  177 minutes a day on their smartphone. Behind  each  of  those  screens  are  applications.  Much  of  the  time, they’re  affordable,  educational,  and  better  able  to  teach  the  new norms  of  interaction  than  any  other  experience.  They  incorporate increasingly sophisticated software, allowing the apps to learn and  The Nature of Play      9   adapt over time. The biggest disadvantage to these apps is that many of them serve up sedentary activities, and are generally not social. Parents worry about the sedentary behavior that toy apps encourage. But, parents are concerned for the wrong reasons. These toys are in fact becoming less passive, and more interactive. And they’re always on. While toys can’t relate to a child as well as humans can, their imme‐ diacy is limitless. Children mistake the undivided attention of a toy for intimacy, and as toys get smarter and more contextual, we risk entering an era of “drone parenting,” abdicating the raising of our children to a digital nanny. However, we aren’t building nannies yet, and we’re still very far from artificial intelligence that can do more than  one  or  two  things  really  well.  Self-driving  cars  and  delivery drones, for example, require a very specific context  a set of human behaviors and information  to operate well. A great deal more con‐ text is required to successfully teach and raise a child to become a responsible  adult.  If  parents  lean  on  technology  to  satisfy  their children’s emotional and physical needs, they may be depriving their children of that context. This is happening before our eyes. Check out MIT’s the Huggable, a robotic teddy bear that helps kids cope with the stress of major ill‐ nesses. The teddy’s brain is a phone. He’s an app, with an adorable little body. So is the pre-programmed playmate Ubooly, dubbed “the learning toy that listens.” So is the robot Jibo, a family-friendly per‐ sonal assistant. So is the robotic ball Sphero, and so are the coding robots Dash and Dot. Is this bad? It’s not the first time we’ve worried about toys. Accord‐ ing  to  London  Knowledge  Lab’s  report  on  Children’s  Playground Games  and  Songs  in  the  New  Media  Age,  “Ever  since  children’s games,  songs,  rhymes,  rituals  and  objects  of  play  were  first  docu‐ mented  in  the  mid-19th  century,  there  have  been  concerns  over their  vulnerability  to  a  succession  of  perceived  threats.  They  have regularly featured as symptoms of what adults imagine as the inno‐ cence of childhood, and its supposed fragility.” The next generation’s imaginary friends will be software-generated, and will change how we learn and think—and maybe that’s a good thing.  10     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   Toy Data: Feedback and Interactivity In  The  Diamond  Age   Bantam  Spectra ,  novelist  Neal  Stephenson envisions  an  interactive  book  that  acts  as  a  guide  for  the  heroine. But A Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer still had human actors behind it, voicing the book and offering advice. Today, we have Siri. Tomor‐ row’s agents will seem vastly more sophisticated. Three Feedback Loops Smart toys have three distinct feedback loops: real-time adjustment of toy behavior based on child’s reaction, pooled behavior and auto‐ mated learning, and product roadmaps established by analytics  see Figure 1-3 .  Figure 1-3. Three feedback loops of smart toys  Together, these three loops guide a toy’s behavior over its lifetime. Let’s look at each loop a bit more closely:    Real-time adjustment of toy behavior based on child’s reaction has been around since the Tamagotchi—toys like Furby can change their behavior and personality based on feedback. Some of the  Toy Data: Feedback and Interactivity      11   newer toys even try to simulate interactivity, and in many cases are programmable.    Pooled behavior and automated learning is the real promise for smart, connected toys. When the sum of all play leads to feed‐ back  and  adaptation,  toys  get  smarter.  Consider  Tesla’s  recent self-driving car: when it was first launched, drivers complained that  it  was  taking  corners  too  quickly,  or  edging  toward  exits when it shouldn’t. But within a week, the cars were learning, as each  time  a  problem  occurred  the  driver  took  the  wheel  and taught the collective intelligence what to do. When toys benefit from similar automated learning, they’ll wise up faster than we expect.    Product  roadmaps  are  informed  by  customer  feedback,  but obtaining this feedback was traditionally done in focus groups and by observing sales or product usage. Building analytics into toys  gives  product  teams  faster  feedback,  and  it  comes  from real-world use rather than staged environments. When the toys are smart, new functionality can be pushed out to them quickly, too.  Wonder  Workshop  lets  children  use  their  Dash  and  Dot robots to compete in a robotics league. This league enabled the Workshop to release a new application for visual coding, Won‐ der, nearly a year after Dash and Dot was launched. With the new  app  came  a  variety  of  new  functions  and  sounds  for  the robots themselves.  Interactive products like smart toys inherently collect data, but that data  can  be  repurposed  and  misappropriated.  How  do  we  control what’s stored, for how long, and how it’s used? Usage of smart toys may even have permanent, long-lasting biologi‐ cal consequences. In a piece she wrote for the UK’s Daily Mail, Pro‐ fessor  Susan  Greenfield  observes  that  “electronic  devices  and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro-cellular struc‐ ture  and  complex  biochemistry  of  our  brains.  And  that,  in  turn, affects  our  personality,  our  behavior,  and  our  characteristics.  In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.”  12     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   The Ethics, Risks, and Promise of Smart Toys Data-driven play, powered by smart toys, has the potential to help us learn and remember better. But it can also break trust and privacy codes, lead to antisocial or addictive behavior, and even introduce new forms of liability for manufacturers. Balancing Privacy and Customization The nature of a child’s relationship with their smart toys opens up serious  privacy  concerns,  as  Mattel  recently  learned  when  it  met some resistance in launching Hello Barbie, a Barbie that “listens” to children by recording, recognizing, and processing their every word. The goal behind Hello Barbie is to allow Barbie to have “conversa‐ tions” with children. ToyTalk, the company that created the Siri-like program that allows Hello Barbie to understand and react to thou‐ sands  of  phrases  and  words,  claims  that  personalized  experiences help children learn and focus. This claim is backed up by research from Georgetown University’s Children’s Digital Media Center. The  issue  with  Hello  Barbie,  though,  is  that  children’s  voices  are recorded, sent to Mattel, and stored. Some might argue that record‐ ing and storing children’s most intimate moments with their toys is just another kind of focus group, and necessary for further develop‐ ment  of  the  toy’s  conversational  algorithms.  But  others  argue  that using data to make a toy more intelligent is pretty terrifying. Many toy companies, such as Pixel, Tiggly, Toy State, Sphero, and Moppadop,  have  privacy  statements  that  govern  how  marketing information  is  used,  or  that  cover  their  web  content.  But  few  are transparent about the data they’re analyzing in real time, or pooling across users, or capturing analytically. And fewer still are thinking about  vulnerabilities  and  hacking.  Consider  the  My  Friend  Cayla doll. It’s a smart toy that can converse, and even comes with a built- in  list  of  bad  words  and  controversial  topics.  Researchers  have learned that the substance of Cayla’s responses can be hacked, trig‐ gering her to spew vulgar and downright creepy language. Toy startup CogniToys sells Dino, a small talking dinosaur that con‐ nects to the cloud to converse with children—similar to IBM’s Wat‐ son. The more a child interacts with Dino, the more Dino will learn  The Ethics, Risks, and Promise of Smart Toys      13   the child’s vocabulary level, interests, and so on. The child’s experi‐ ence with Dino will then be altered accordingly. “For smart toys that involve mixing physical and digital experiences, the child’s attention is split 80 20 between the digital and the physi‐ cal,” explained one senior toy company executive, who agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity. “Skylanders is a good exam‐ ple  of  this.  The  promise  of  cloud-enabled  smart  toys  is  that  they provide  a  better  and  more  immersive  play  experience  and  can unlock more imagination and creativity through dynamic content. It’s hard to say how children will interact with that category of prod‐ ucts since there haven’t been any big hits with wide distribution— the jury is still out.” The Risk of Social Withdrawal and Addiction Smart toys present another potential risk—not to children’s imagi‐ nations, but to their social development. When toys become smart enough to satisfy a child’s basic need for approval without human interaction, the child may be less motivated to learn from and inter‐ act with other people. This wasn’t a concern with television because it wasn’t interactive—TV sets didn’t give children real-time feedback or try to mimic a living, emotive being. Modern technology creates a completely new kind of relationship between a child and her toy— smart toys blur the line between real and imaginary friends. Linda  El-Fakir,  of  The  Big  Idea  Factory,  is  less  worried.  “Children connect emotionally with their pets and their pets usually appear to ‘care’ back, especially dogs,” she said. “Does this cause Social Con‐ nectivity Deficit Disorder? I think not, and in fact we generally pro‐ mote that kid–pet bond and relationship as reinforcing a whole host of  positive  behaviors.”  Linda  observes  that  the  manifestation  of social disorders is possibly rooted in childhood, not toys. “If a child thought  their  electronic,  battery-driven  interactive  smart  toy  was ‘real,’  and  it  went  on  longer  than  just  an  ‘imaginary  friend’  phase, and they started withdrawing from the real world, then that would be a cause for parental concern. I’d label that as an individual psy‐ chological issue with a child in need of counselling, and not the fault of the toy or the toymaker.”  14     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   What Happens When the Toy Breaks? As children come to rely on their toys as companions, they become dependent  on  them.  Toys  will  become  smart  agents,  lifelong  per‐ sonal  assistants.  They  build  up  context  and  knowledge  about  a child’s life, personality, education. Virtual reality experiments using smart toys are currently being carried out on pre-language children to  determine  their  likelihood  of  having  autism  or  a  spectrum  of other disorders. Biometric and evaluation data is then shared with parents  as  a  way  to  inform  their  child’s  progress  in  school,  and  is also being transmitted over the cloud and stored by the school. No one really knows what happens to this information, or how it may impact children later in life. Another executive from a major toy manufacturer, speaking on con‐ dition of anonymity, expressed real concern about the impact of dig‐ ital “friends,” and went so far as to state, “Creating and imagination are suffering because of smart toys and digital experiences. Ask the average eight-year-old, especially on one of the coasts or in a major metropolitan  area,  to  play  pretend  and  you’ll  get  a  puzzled  face looking back at you. Digital tools and platforms give kids a different way to express themselves and their imaginations, but on their own, aren’t an enhancement or substitute. Your imagination is like a mus‐ cle—you need to train it and exercise it regularly, or else it will atro‐ phy.” When  the  toys  and  companions  on  which  modern  children  have come to depend break, or when their functionality is compromised by a software upgrade or system maintenance, how will these chil‐ dren react? The Ethics of Algorithms Smart toys operate on feedback and algorithms. The behaviors those algorithms produce could be a source of liability—My Friend Cayla, for  example,  is  programmed  to  speak  on  certain  sensitive  topics such as religion, politics, and sexuality. The toy’s manufacturer says exposing children to these topics will “cause Cayla to encourage the child to go and ask a parent or teacher.” But  who’s  liable  when  these  algorithms  go  awry?  Does  failure  to monitor  and  adjust  a  toy’s  parameters  constitute  parental  neglect? Similarly, would parents want toymakers to adjust a toy’s behavior in  The Ethics, Risks, and Promise of Smart Toys      15   order to improve a child’s grades, or make them less socially awk‐ ward? Consider in Figure 1-4 how Google handles a search for suicide— with both an ad for a help organization, and inline information on suicide  prevention.  How  should  a  smart  toy  respond  to  a  similar request?  And  what  about  a  less  obvious  one,  such  as  a  pattern  of depression? Is the manufacturer liable for not detecting such signs?  Figure 1-4. Google search results for “suicide”  One toy company expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, cited a double-standard at work in the toy industry. “The regulatory and liability  landscape  is  evolving  in  this  space,”  he  said.  “I’d  say  that smaller companies will be held to looser standards than larger ones, creating  an  uneven  and  non-competitive  landscape  in  the  near term.” The Benefits of a Smart Companion There  are  upsides  to  smart  toys,  too.  Smart  toys  that  learn  from users and provide personalized education are a kind of one-on-one tutoring that was once only available to few children. Smart toys can also creatively inspire users by providing them with compelling sce‐ narios  full  of  novelty,  environments  that  stimulate  the  user  rather than  forcing  them  to  battle  the  ennui  of  repetition.  According  to  16     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   Google’s vice president of research Alfred Spector, in a BBC article, “We have user interfaces that are so exciting that people play video games  for  hours  and  hours  a  day,  and  they  could  be  educated  by them.” What’s  more,  connecting  users  enables  information  to  be  shared socially.  Evidence  supports  the  theory  that  we  retain  information more effectively when we learn from peers in a social setting, rather than when our training is delivered exclusively through lectures and independent research. Rob Whent, CEO of startup Thriver, wanted to help his son to learn more effectively. With the help of British pediatric neuropsycholo‐ gist Jonathan Reed, he identified 44 specific cognitive skills, which Thriver  now  uses  to  generate  a  child’s  cognitive  fingerprint.  The website adjusts the library of games offered to a child, based on their unique cognitive profile. The idea is to encourage the best learning environment possible for a child. “Once we have a cognitive profile, the digital world can change to meet our needs,” said Whent in an interview with Parents magazine. “Technology will adapt to us, and not the other way around.” It’s still unclear whether smart toys and interactive games produce smarter humans, though. Many of the toy industry experts we inter‐ viewed  agreed  with  this  assessment.  Linda  El-Fakir  observed  that “advantage, privilege, quality of schooling, and basic raw intellect are bigger factors in creating ‘smart’ kids and making kids ‘smarter’ than smart toys and interactive devices.” She went on to add that, “every‐ thing a child experiences in their environment influences develop‐ ment, and the more experiences that they are exposed to, the more they can build and reinforce skills and concepts.” Another toy industry expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, believes that “there will eventually be evidence that kids that interact with technology at a younger age have a deeper intuition about how devices work,” in part because of familiarity and in part because it gets kids thinking about how something works. And still another toy industry expert, speaking on condition of ano‐ nymity, stated that content and curriculum, not technology, have the most powerful impact on a child’s development. “There are building blocks of larger concepts that kids can learn through playful activi‐ ties, but I think it’s a leap to conclude that kids are learning about the  building  blocks  of  physics  by  playing  games  with  a  physics  The Ethics, Risks, and Promise of Smart Toys      17   engine   like  Angry  Birds   or  that  kids  are  learning  how  to  code because  they  can  grasp  how  a  conditional  statement  works.”  This expert continued to say that free play with smart toys can be trans‐ formational, but only for a small portion of kids. “Those kids are the ones that use Legos without instructions or a picture on a box.” What’s Next? Today’s toys are on the cusp of becoming truly intelligent. Data col‐ lection  is  still  largely  informed  by  decades-old  policies  from  the advertising industry—that is, keep everything, whether you need it or not, and don’t give it an expiration date. Vendors are still trying to figure out how to make toys interactive while handling sensitive data properly. They’re also trying to determine how to provide ana‐ lytics around how children learn without stigmatizing them or cap‐ turing information that might have legal or ethical consequences. Here are my four big predictions for how data and technology will change the nature of play and toys in the coming decade: Play becomes connected  A  generation  that  is  growing  up  connected  is  playing  in  new ways. Multiplayer play often involves connecting with others at a distance—from Club Penguin and other kid-safe online envi‐ ronments, to Minecraft, Gary’s Mod, and sandbox games where children can extend the game beyond its intended scope to cre‐ ate their own games. We take this connectivity for granted, but it’s a fairly recent phenomenon that began with console games and massively multiplayer online games, and is only now find‐ ing its way into toys for younger children. At  the  same  time,  a  trend  toward  smaller  families  and  career parents having children later in life suggests that connected play may become a more prevalent form of interaction for children.  Toys go from digital parlor trick to true AI  The Tamagotchi wasn’t smart; it simply ran a series of subrou‐ tines. Guessing games were simply linked lists. Even supposedly interactive  toys,  like  Teddy  Ruxpin  and  the  Furby,  were  little more than digital parlor tricks. But  if  you  play  a  video  game,  your  computer  opponent  will become  smarter.  Many  modern  adventure  games  advertise adaptive  AI,  which  means  that  non-player  characters  change their behavior based on what it has learned from its opponent’s  18     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   previous  actions:  members  of  your  squad  fight  intelligently, seeking  cover  and  attacking  opportunistically;  a  shopkeeper calls  the  police  if  they  saw  you  steal  earlier  in  the  game;  an enemy selects a better weapon to counter your attacks the sec‐ ond time. This kind of technology is leaking out of video games and into household toys. Children already see Siri as a source of answers; it won’t be long before they’re playing games with its successors. To succeed, however, toys need to grow and change with their users,  both  functionally  and  physically.  Pleo,  for  example, claimed it would grow and change with a child. “[The Pleo toy had] lots of depth,” said one industry insider. “But the execution left much to be desired, as the build-up of its intelligence meant that out of the box, it fell flat. The ‘growth’ play pattern was not mirrored by a physical evolution, so it was just a slow unlocking of abilities.”  More play happens in immersive environments  Today, children often play with toys within screens. Tomorrow, we’ll  do  it  within  worlds.  Virtual  reality  has  been  called  an empathy machine; indeed, some researchers are using immer‐ sive  digital  environments  to  change  real-world  behavior. According  to  Backchannel  writer  Sarah  C.P.  Williams,  seeing virtual  versions  of  yourself  make  good  or  bad  decisions  can affect how you act, reducing your desire to overeat or increasing how much money you save when seeing your virtual self grow old. How long until virtual reality and personal avatars become toys? The  volume  of  data  collected  from  such  play  is  unthinkably large, and systems will use that data to optimize and adjust the experience for the child.  Makers and crowds speed up innovation  Today’s  innovators  have  access  to  a  tremendous  amount  of leading-edge  manufacturing  products:  3D  printers,  Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, cheap lighting ordered online. They can also buy customizable kits, from snappable electronics such as Little‐ bits  to  full-fledged  robots  from  Meccano.  And  the  Kickstarter model—test  an  idea,  build  it  if  there’s  demand—has  helped launch dozens of smart toy products. This maker approach to toys is accelerating the pace of innova‐ tion in the toy industry. Where larger toy firms are reluctant to  What’s Next?      19   innovate quickly, constrained by concerns about shelf space and channel  conflict,  smaller  toy  startups  have  little  to  lose.  They can distribute through their own crowdfunding or online sales, or even rely on niche distributors like ThinkGeek and Brook‐ stone.  Conclusion Play is a vital part of how we learn to work with the world around us. It’s unstructured, creative, and experimental. But as technology changes toys, it also changes the nature of play. Toys now have opin‐ ions, which means games are less open-ended. Toys are now con‐ nected, which enables at-a-distance play among groups and software updates. And toys now learn and adapt, using growing amounts of data that is collected and analyzed. It’s still early days for digital toys, but the changes are already wide‐ spread. Video games and smartphones have weaned a generation on technology.  Lower  manufacturing  costs  and  the  ability  to  target early  adopters  through  online  channels  have  spurred  innovation. Smart toys are evolving, and they’re going to change how children learn and socialize. They’re also going to have a permanent impact on our brains, our culture, and ultimately, our species.  20     Data, Technology, and the Future of Play   Appendix: Companies and Resources  In  preparing  this  report,  we  looked  at  the  toy  companies  listed  in Table  A-1  and  Table  A-2,  and  in  many  cases  spoke  with  them directly.

She spent her childhood running through  forests,  fishing,  swimming,  and  climbing  trees.  She launched  her  first  digital  media  company   PO-MO  Inc.   in  2010, and she and her team have since designed thousands of interactive floor and wall displays worldwide. Today, Meghan is the CEO of Lumo Play, and spends most of her time  developing  an  interactive  projector  that  transforms  a  child’s room  into  an  interactive  playground.  The  toy,  called  Lumo,  is inspired  by  Meghan’s  experiences  as  an  interactive  digital  media producer  and  single  parent  with  concerns  about  screen  time  and childhood development.

Toys are becoming increasingly smarter. Once merely objects of play, today’s toys often act as agents of play, guiding kids toward learning through interactivity and feedback. As this O’Reilly report explains, smart toys not only employ sophisticated algorithms, but also share data and get updates via the cloud. What are the implications of a toy that, instead of fostering open-ended play, now becomes the playmate? Author Meghan Athavale takes you on an objective tour of today’s smart toys: how they’ve evolved from their roots in the early ’90s, as well as the ethics, risks, and promise they carry with them. Though it’s still early days, digital toys are already changing how children learn and socialize. They’re also likely to have a permanent impact on our brains and our culture. In this report, you’ll explore: Three feedback loops that guide the behavior of a smart toy over its lifetime; Privacy concerns about a smart toy’s ability to "converse" with children by collecting and storing conversations; The risk of children becoming socially withdrawn and addicted to technology due to increased use of smart toys;
Benefits of smart toys, including the ability of the machines to learn from users and provide customized education; Predictions for how data and technology will change the nature of play and toys—including connected play and immersive environments.
