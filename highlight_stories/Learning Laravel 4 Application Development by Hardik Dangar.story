This book will walk you through every single step you need to learn as a beginner   to develop Laravel applications with project examples for each. I have used a   real-world project that I have developed in Laravel 4 for one of my clients as   a sample project to help you go through each process of project development   in Laravel 4.  This book covers most of the things you should know when you are developing a  project in Laravel 4.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Welcome to the World of Laravel, introduces the basic MVC concepts and  Laravel 4 to you and explains why you should develop your next project in Laravel 4. Chapter 2, Let's Begin the Journey, explains how to install Laravel 4 and the configuration  settings you may need to change. Chapter 3, Creating a Simple CRUD Application in Hours, will take you through a  360-degree spin ride of how awesome Laravel is for simple CRUD applications   and how you can build them with Laravel 4 in hours instead of days. Chapter 4, Building a Real-life Application with Laravel 4 – The Foldagram, explains  how to start a real-world project in Laravel 4. It starts with the requirements. It  also explains how you can build migrations in Laravel to manage your database in  versions. Then, at the end of the chapter,  it explains how to build the frontend of  your project as well as some of the frontend features of the project.   Chapter 5, Creating a Cart Package for Our Application, explains how Laravel 4 handles  packages. Then, it includes the core concepts of the Laravel framework for us to  understand the relationship between packages and the IoC container and learn how  we can create packages. Then, at the end, we will see how to build our own Cart  package, which can be used in our project as well as other projects. Chapter 6, User Management and Payment Gateway Integration, explains how to build  user registration, login, and dashboard pages for our project. You will learn how to  authenticate users and to integrate the cart with the payment gateway. You will also  learn how to utilize existing Laravel packages, and how to find them and integrate  them in your projects. Chapter 7, The Admin Section, explains how to build the administration area of our  project. You will learn how to build the backend foundation of the project and then  the features of our project, such as managing orders, exporting orders, adding credit  to users, managing users, resetting passwords, and blocking users. Chapter 8, Building a RESTful API with Laravel – Store Locator, explains how we can  create RESTful applications with Laravel and also how to build an Ajax-powered,  one-page store locator application based on the RESTful API built with Laravel. Chapter 9, Optimizing and Securing Our Applications, explains how you can   optimize your applications with the Laravel profiler and how to add security   layers in Your application. Chapter 10, Deploying Laravel Applications, explains how to deploy Laravel  applications. It teaches you how to deploy application with FTP or SSH   and how to use Git to manage automatic deployments. Chapter 11, Creating a Workflow and Useful Laravel Packages and Tools, explains   some of the useful packages that can be used to create web applications rapidly   in Laravel. It also gives some tips on the tools and workflows that will make   your life easy as a developer.  What you need for this book Throughout this book, I have assumed that you have the following   programs packages installed:     Composer    PHP 5.3.7 or later    MCrypt PHP extension    One of the databases, such as MySQL, MSSQL, and PGSQL  [ 2 ]   If you don't have them, don't worry. Chapter 2, Let's Begin the Journey of this book will  guide you through installing them.  Who this book is for This book is for developers who are new to the Laravel framework as well as  developers who want to explore the new breed of Laravel 4, which has been  completely redeveloped by Taylor Otwell. You will need to know the basics of   PHP and MySQL as well as some basic concepts about object-oriented programming.  If you are tired of dealing with the old way of developing PHP applications and  want to use Laravel 4 to manage your project and learn how to do it step-by-step,  then this book is for you.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:  "You can define RESTful controllers via Laravel 4, and Controllers can have a  predefined method to receive a request via GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, and UPDATE."  A block of code is set as follows:  $env = $app->detectEnvironment array     'local' => array 'your-machine-name' ,    'production' => array 'example.com' ,   ;  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  return array        'connections' => array                 'mysql' => array                 'driver'    => 'mysql',                'host'      => 'db.example.com',                'database'  => 'myapp',                'username'  => 'myappuser',                'password'  => 'myapppassword',                'charset'   => 'utf8',  [ 3 ]                  'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',                'prefix'    => '',              ,          ;  Any command-line input or output is written as follows:   php artisan routes  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen,  in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Also, we have an  Add User button which will allow the user to add a new user into the system."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ 5 ]    Welcome to the   World of Laravel  In this chapter we are going to look at what MVC is and how it fits in web  development. We will also look into some of the unique features of the Laravel  framework, and we will see later what Laravel 4 offers us and how it is helpful   to the developers.  There comes a time in every developer's life where you really want to change the  way you work. You want to organize your code; you really care about how you are  dividing things and try to refactor your code. You try to learn advanced patterns  so that you can manage things, and as you move project-by-project, you develop a  framework around your code, which you will use each time you create a new project. You are beginning to realize there are other options too such as Frameworks.  Frameworks are developed by the community, and you start to explore them and  realize that there are some really good patterns. You also realize that a lot of the  grunt work, which you have to do at the time of project initiation, has been done in  the framework so that you can enjoy the experience of coding. You think you were  stupid enough to not use this in your projects in the first place. You start thinking  about objects, classes, patterns, and procedures.  Then it strikes to you, the moment of truth, and you decide to put yourself   in the shoes of the framework. This is where this book helps you by guiding   you step-by-step through the real-world application development via Laravel 4  Framework. I have chosen to walk you carefully through the real-world application  development where scopes change, and you have to be ready for constantly changing  your code. I will show you how you can effectively use Laravel to minimize the impact  of changes and how you can develop applications that take away the pain you feel as a  developer when changes constantly evolve in your application.   Landing yourself into the MVC world When you look around in today's development world, you can find MVC  everywhere. Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, and PHP Frameworks such as CakePHP   and Code Igniter all are using it. So what is it that makes MVC such an important  part of all these frameworks? The answer is Separation of Logic from your representation layer  Views HTML .  MVC allows you to write the code that can be divided on the basis of three things:     Model: Models are the way by which you can interact with data. It's a layer   between your data and your application. Data can be in the database systems  such as MySQL or MSSQL or simple Excel or XML files.     Views: Views are the visual representation of your application. Views allow   us to write our presentation layer from our business logic.     Controller: Controller is a link between your Model and Views. The primary  responsibility of a Controller is to handle requests and pass data from Model  to Views.  User Request  Controller   filter user request   R  e  s  p  o  n  s  e  R  e  q  u  e  s t   D  a t a  Views  Models  Represents Data  The way MVC gives you the structure you can actually create separate views for  single models, that is, if you are creating an e-commerce site, think of a products  page. It can have multiple views such as the Product List View or Product Gallery  View. In the MVC world, you will create one model for your product table and via  that one model you can generate multiple views.  [ 8 ]   In a typical MVC web framework, you will find that Controllers handle user  request and user data validation and business logic, Models represent data, and  Views generate output data. Here is a Laravel framework example of our product's  Controller, Model, and View:  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub. com support and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you.  The code example for products Controller is as follows:  class ProductsController extends BaseController{    public function listIndex     {     $products = Products::all  ;     return View::make 'products', compact 'products'   ;   }    public function galleryIndex     {     $products = Products::all  ;     return View::make 'products_gallery', compact 'products'   ;   } }  Here, the Products Controller executes the function based on the URI route. For  example, if the route is http:  sample.com list, it will execute the listIndex  function which will get all products via the Products Model defined as follows:  The code example for products Model is as follows:  Class Products extends Eloquent {}  The code example for gallery View is as follows:      @foreach  $products as $product       img }}"  >{{ $product->name }}    @endforeach    [ 9 ]   The preceding view is for the product gallery view. We are iterating the products  array and displaying it on the gallery View:  The code example for list View is as follows:      @foreach  $products as $product       img }}"  >      {{ $product->name }}    @endforeach    The preceding view is for the product list view. We are iterating the products array  and displaying it on the List view.  Now, if the client asks for changing the order of products in the descending order  after six months, all we have to do is change the code we are using to fetch this data,  and we will know that we have a fixed Controller for our products. We can then  instantly recognize the place where we would have to make the change instead of  scanning hundreds of files. If you want to change the look of site, you can just change  Views. So, MVC provides us a structure that is easily recognizable as well as we  know that when we change things, it will not affect other portions of our web pages.  Why Laravel 4 is awesome! And why it  must be your next framework The philosophy of Laravel's creator Taylor Otwell about Laravel is that:  Development should be a creative experience that you enjoy, not something that is  painful.  The framework reflects that Laravel is a simple and elegant framework for PHP web  development with expressive and artistic syntaxes. But there is more to Laravel 4. It  is one of the few frameworks that have implemented Composer and in such a way  that it gives you full control over what you want to choose in your framework. Let's  review what has changed in the PHP community and how Laravel has adopted these  changes in its significant Version 4.  [ 10 ]   The PHP community has been going through a revolution over the last few years.  Those of you who are still not aware of the recent PHP development should read the  guide phptherightway  http:  www.phptherightway.com   on what has changed in  the recent PHP versions and how the community is creating an echo system that will  change the way PHP is used in projects. One important thing that happened during  these revolution is that a lot of framework developers met at phptek in 2009 and  formed the FIG  Framework Interoperability Group . The group formed standards  that allow them to work together and share code even if frameworks are different.  These standards are called PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-3. PSR- standards lay the  foundation for Composer, which is a dependency management system for PHP. To  know more about PSR standards, visit http:  net.tutsplus.com tutorials  php psr-huh . So what is dependency? Dependency is a class or package we use in our code to  achieve some specific tasks such as sending e-mails via PHPMailer or Swift Mailer.  Now in this case, PHPMailer and Swift Mailer is a dependency of our application.  Remember that a dependency can have another dependency, that is, Swift Mailer  could be using some other third-party class or package that you are not aware of.  Composer Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. The most important thing  about composer is that it can manage the dependency of your project dependencies;  that is, if one of the libraries you are using in your project is dependent on two  other libraries, you don't have to manually find and update anything to upgrade  them. All three libraries can be updated via a single command, that is, Composer  Update. Composer can manage dependency up to N level means all dependency of  your project via single tool which is really powerful option to have when you are  using lot of libraries. The other benefit is that it manages the auto load file, which  will include all your dependencies. So you don't have to remember all paths to your  dependencies and include each of them on every file of your project, just include the  autoload file provided by composer. So what is it that makes Laravel 4 stand out from other frameworks? We will discuss  these features as follows:     Composer ready: Composer is the way the PHP community is going and  there are thousands  7,000 currently  of packages already available in the  Composer package archive  https:  packagist.org  . Laravel 4 was  designed in such a way that it integrates Composer packages easily. Laravel  4 itself uses some of the Composer components such as Symphony2's HTTP  package for routing in Laravel 4. Say you want to send an SMTP e-mail with  attachments. Download a Swift Mailer component with Composer, and you  can directly use the Swift Mailer component anywhere in your project.  [ 11 ]       Interoperability: Laravel 4 is actually a mixture of different Composer  components. All of these components are available in Github and all are   100 percent unit tested. Some of those components are carefully chosen by  Taylor Otwell from very carefully crafted frameworks such as Symphony 2.    Laravel 4 gives you the power of choosing what you like. For example, you   don't like the Mail component of Laravel, which is Swift Mailer actually,  and you want to replace it with the PHPMailer component which you really  like and is also Composer ready; thus, it will be a very easy operation to  switch these two. You can swipe components as and when you need via the  Composer and Laravel configuration.     You don't have to wait for months for updating that one feature you want   for your database component. You can just simply update individual  components via the composer update.     You can further develop core components yourself and use it in your projects   without having to worry about the impact of changes in your framework.  Here are some of the unique features of Laravel:     Eloquent ORM: Laravel has one of the most advanced built-in ORMs   called Eloquent that allows you to write database tables as objects and also  allows you to interact with those objects. You can actually perform database  operations without writing SQL queries. And it's also kind of unique because  it allows you to maintain a relationship between tables, so you can perform  lot of operations on multiple tables without writing long queries via objects.     Routes: Developers can write their logic either in Routers or Controllers. This  can be handful when you have a small site, or you want to define static pages  quickly. You would not need to write Controllers for every page of your site.    RESTful: Laravel 4 provides us with a unique way of creating RESTful APIs.   You can define RESTful controllers via Laravel 4, and Controllers can have  predefined methods to receive requests via GET, PUT, DELETE, POST, and  UPDATE. We will see this in later chapters in detail when we build RESTful  APIs with the help of Laravel 4.     Auto loading: Laravel 4 automatically loads all your dependencies such    as libraries, packages, and Models. You don't have to manually load  anything. Laravel 4 is smart about anything you use in your code since   it will automatically load that class or library when you use it. IOC containers: An IOC container is Laravel's way to manage independent  components and provide a unique way to control them via a single API.      [ 12 ]      Migrations: Most of PHP fameworks take migrations, which is version   management for your database. Laravel 4 has introduced migration with   DB Seeds, which allows you to manage your database version as well as   add some seed data as and when you need.     Pagination: Laravel 4 makes pagination breeze by, giving you a powerful   library that allows you to write your pagination in simply three lines, which in  other frameworks or a manual code would take hundreds of line of the code.  We will see this in later chapters in detail when we build our application.     Unit testing: Laravel Framework was built with unit testing in mind. The   framework itself provides unit tests for all of its components, and that's one  of the reasons it's very stable as well as fast paced as constant changes can  be tested via unit tests. You can also add your unit tests directly just like you  write application classes. It allows various features such as seeding database  from unit test classes and custom session handling, so you can test pretty  much everything for your application.     Artisan: Artisan is the command-line tool of Laravel that allows you to   perform a lot of grunt tasks you would hate to do manually. Artisan can be  used to create your basic Controller, Model, and View files directly via the  command line. It can also build migrations which can be handy to manage  your database schema. With Laravel 4, you can create your own commands  and do useful stuff such as send pending mails to people, or repair database,  or anything that may be required occasionally for your application. You can  also create database seeds that will allow you to seed some data initially.  Artisan can also run unit tests for your application. We will see all of this in  detail during our application development.     Queues: Laravel 4 has this really nice feature that every web developer   dreams of—Queues. Yes, you can queue your tasks in Laravel 4 and what's  so amazing about it is that users don't have to wait anymore for very long  tasks; like you are generating multipage PDF or sending a lot of e-mails.  You can just queue your tasks, and it will get executed later without slowing  down the process.     Events: Laravel 4 provides events and you can hook your code into   application-specific Laravel events. It's one of the features that really help  developers. You can also create custom events for your application, or you  can hook into Laravel 4 application-specific events such as Laravel.log,  Laravel.query event.  [ 13 ]   I believe Laravel's features make a huge difference in how easy it is to write reusable,  maintainable code. It is one of the major aspects of any framework. Laravel provides  us with a base platform, which removes us from all cumbersome tasks and gives us  a clean syntax. It also includes awesome tools to develop our project in such a way  that we can enjoy the whole experience of doing it as a developer. Laravel 4 is the  fresh air the PHP community needed after years of stalled development. Laravel  reassembles new PHP 5.3 features and gives us many more features as a framework,  which previously was not possible. And that's all about Laravel 4 features. I have just  given the basic features in later chapters. We will see in detail the various features of  Laravel 4 and explore how you can actually use them in your projects.  Summary So we have learned how the MVC world works, what a composer is, and how it  helps you in managing the dependencies of your application, and what Laravel 4  offers as an MVC framework and its unique features. In the next chapter let's dig  deeper into the world of Laravel 4. If this excites you, let's begin the journey of  Laravel 4.  [ 14 ]   Let's Begin the Journey  In this chapter, we are going to learn how we can install and configure Laravel  4. We will see how Laravel structures itself. Also, we'll talk about some useful  configurations you should know before starting your project in Laravel 4.  Let's start our journey. The first step of our journey is to install Laravel successfully.  Laravel 4 has few system requirements:  We will see how to install Laravel 4 on the following operating systems:     Composer    PHP 5.3.7 or later    MCrypt PHP extension     Windows 7    Ubuntu Linux    Mac OS X  In this chapter, we will see how we can install and configure Laravel 4 on our  development environment. We will also learn the basic foundations of the Laravel 4  structure, learn where our code resides, and how Laravel 4 manages dependencies  and gives us a simple syntax while hiding complex stuff.   Installing Laravel 4 on Windows You will need to install a web server on Windows. If you don't want to fight your  way around by installing different components, fixing path errors, and manually  editing a lot of files, you can download a prepackaged development environment  that has everything configured in one single bundle. Here are some of the popular  environments for Windows:     WAMP  http:  www.wampserver.com en      XAMPP  http:  www.apachefriends.org en xampp.html   Installing Composer Once you have successfully installed a development environment, you will   need to install Composer. Composer could be installed either locally or globally.  If you want to install Composer globally, download the Composer setup from the  Composer website  http:  www.getcomposer.org download . If you want to  install Composer in your project directory, you can download it via executing the  following command on the Windows command line:  > php -r "eval '?>'.file_get_contents 'https:  getcomposer.org  installer'  ;"  It will download the composer.phar file into your project directory. You can test  Composer by executing the following command:  > php composer.phar about  If you have installed it globally, you don't need to use PHP, you can run the  following command:  > composer about  If Composer is installed correctly, it will give you the output Composer—package  management for PHP.  Installing Laravel 4 Now, as Composer is installed, let's install Laravel 4 by downloading the Laravel  4 ZIP file from https:  github.com laravel laravel archive master.zip;  alternatively, you can even install it using the Composer command by going to the  root of your server  generally, C:\xampp\www in case of XAMPP or C:\wamp\www for  a WAMP server .  > composer create-project laravel laravel    [ 16 ]   The preceding command will install and configure Laravel for you in the myproject  directory at the root of your web server.  If you have downloaded the ZIP file, extract it in your web server's www folder.   So if you have installed XAMPP in C:\xampp, generally the path would be   c:\xampp\www; if WAMP, it would be C:\WAMP\. You will have the Laravel folder  in your XAMPP folder. Now the Laravel directory will be there, but it's not ready for  use. You need to download packages before you can run Laravel 4. The way this  works is via Composer; you can download all the packages required to install and  run Laravel 4 after the initial barebone files. Laravel 4 comes with the composer. json file that has all the dependent packages in .json format, which Composer can  understand and download. The great thing about Composer is that it can download  dependent packages of the package you are downloading. Now all you have to do  to install packages is run the following command on the command line from the root  directory of your project.  If you have Composer installed globally:  > composer install  If you have Composer installed in the Project directory:  > php composer.phar install  What this command will do is install all the dependencies mentioned in composer. json into the Vendors directory located at the root directory of your project. Also  Composer creates an autoload file in the Vendor directory that can be used by any  framework to autoload packages as and when needed.  So now you have Laravel 4 installed. Go visit your http:  localhost laravel or  http:  127.0.0.1 laravel page. You might wonder what happened, why does  it show directory listing. Well, you need to go to the public directory, so actually  it would be either http:  localhost laravel public or http:  127.0.0.1  laravel public. If all goes well, you will be greeted by the You have Arrived  page. If you get this far, congratulations! You have successfully installed Laravel 4 in  your Windows development environment; we will see how to further configure our  environment later in the chapter.  Installing Laravel 4 on Linux Ubuntu You will need to install a web server before installing anything else. You can do that  by installing a LAMP server directly using the following command:  $ sudo tasksel  [ 17 ]   If the preceding command says tasksel is not found, you would need to install  tasksel using the following command:  $ sudo apt-get install tasksel  Tasksel will show you different packages that you can install; select the LAMP server  from the list and install the package. Once you install it, you can install Composer  using the following command:  $ curl -sS https:  getcomposer.org installer  php  Or if you don't have curl installed, use the following command:  $ php -r "eval '?>'.file_get_contents 'https:  getcomposer.org  installer'  ;"  This will install Composer into the local directory of your project. To install it globally,  you can copy your composer.phar file to your bin directory in  usr local .  Now you can download Laravel 4 from the download section at http:  laravel. com or https:  github.com laravel laravel archive master.zip; once the  download is complete, you can extract it into  var www of your system, which is  generally the document root of your LAMP server.  After extracting the files, you will need to download Laravel packages via Composer;  here is command for doing that:  $ php Composer.phar install  One more step you need to make sure for Laravel 4 to work is that of setting up  appropriate permissions. You need to give correct permissions to the storage folder  of the Laravel framework. You can do this using the following command:  $ sudo chmod –R o+w storage  So now you have Laravel 4 Installed. Go visit your http:  localhost laravel or  http:  127.0.0.1 laravel page. You might wonder what happened, why does  it show directory listing. Well, you need to go to the public directory, so actually  it would be either http:  localhost laravel or http:  127.0.0.1 laravel  public. If all goes well, you will be greeted by the Hello world page. If you get this  far, congratulations! You have successfully installed Laravel 4 in your Linux Ubuntu  development environment. We will see how to further configure our environment  later in this chapter.  [ 18 ]   Installing Laravel 4 on Mac You will need to install a web server before installing anything else. You   can do that by installing the MAMP server using the following prepackaged  development environment:     MAMP stack  http:  www.mamp.info en mamp index.html   Once you install the MAMP server, you can install Composer using the following  command line:  $ brew tap josegonzalez homebrew-php  $ brew install josegonzalez php composer  Or if you don't have homebrew installed, use the following command:  $ php -r "eval '?>'.file_get_contents 'https:  getcomposer.org  installer'  ;"  This will install Composer into the local directory of your project. To install it globally,  you can copy your composer.phar file to your bin directory in  usr local .  Now you can download Laravel 4 from the download section at http:  laravel. com or https:  github.com laravel laravel archive master.zip; once the  download is complete, you can extract it into  var www of your system, which is  generally the document root of your MAMP server.  After extracting the files, you will need to download Laravel packages via Composer;  here is the command for doing that:  $ php Composer.phar install  One more step you need to make sure for Laravel 4 to work is that of setting up  appropriate permissions. You need to give correct permissions to the storage folder  of the Laravel framework. Here is the command for that:  $ sudo chmod –R o+w storage  So now you have Laravel 4 installed. Go visit your http:  localhost laravel or  http:  127.0.0.1 laravel page. You might wonder what happened, why does  it show directory listing. Well, you need to go to the public directory, so actually  it would be either http:  localhost laravel public or http:  127.0.0.1  laravel public. If all goes well, you will be greeted by the Hello world page.  If you get this far, congratulations! You have successfully installed Laravel 4 in  your Mac development environment. We will see how to further configure our  environment later in this chapter.  [ 19 ]   Exploring the Laravel 4 structure Now as you have installed Laravel 4 successfully, let's explore what's inside   Laravel 4, how it functions, and what are its core components.  [ 20 ]   As we can see in preceding screenshot, Laravel 4 has four directories and four files in  the root directory. Here is a breakdown of each of them:  Directory File  app   bootstrap   public   vendor  artisan  composer.json  phpunit.xml  server.php  Usage This directory contains all your controllers, models, and views. In  short, all the logic needed to run your application written by you  would be available here. This directory contains all the files such as start.php, paths.php,  and autoload.php that bootstrap the Laravel 4 application. Any  request that hits your application will go through start.php first. This directory is the public part of your site. Here you'll find index. php, which actually bootstraps an instance of the Laravel 4 app. All  your assets will also go here. This directory contains third-party packages that Laravel 4 uses.  As we already know from Chapter 1, Welcome to the World of  Laravel, Laravel 4 is made up of individual components, and those  components can be found here. This is Laravel's magic command-line tool that will make your life  better as a developer. We will look at artisan briefly later in this  chapter. The composer.json directory is a file with all your project package  dependencies along with their version numbers. The phpunit.xml directory is a support file for testing with  PHPUnit testing tools. This file provides Apache's mod_rewrite facility for a built-in PHP  server testing without installing a web server.  We will be working extensively on the  app directory of our project. So let's get a  closer look at what it contains and how we can develop our app around this directory.  The following table shows Laravel 4's app directory structure in detail:  Directory File  commands   config   controllers  Usage This directory allows you to create your own custom artisan  commands. We will see this later in detail. This directory contains the entire configuration your project may  need, which includes your environment information, that is, either  the local, staging, or live environment. It also contains database  settings, session settings, and many more configurations you can  think of. This directory allows you to create a controller class that provides a  gateway to models and views.  [ 21 ]   Directory File  database   lang   models   start   storage   tests   views  Filters.php  Routes.php  Usage This directory contains migrations that actually build your database  via version management and database seeds, which can be used to  create runtime data to test your application. This directory provides you with a way to make your application  multilingual. The lines for pagination and form validation messages  are in English. Models deal with all your data. Model classes provide a simple way  of managing data and will contain all your business logic. The start directory has settings for your custom artisan commands as  well as all global and local settings. The storage directory is where Laravel stores its cache and session  files. Laravel needs read write permission on this directory for this  reason. The tests directory provides you with a simple location where you  can write all your unit tests, and on top of this, you can run those  tests via Laravel's artisan command line. This is your theme directory or the presentation layer. You can write  all your HTML templates here with template engines such as twig or  blade. This file allows you to catch any request before it hits the route or  controller, and you can process it for reasons such as security or  authentication. This file has all the routing information that helps Laravel to transfer  a request to either route or controller.  Now we know a lot of things about Laravel; let's see how a typical user request flows  through the entire Laravel 4 framework and how response gets generated.  public .htaccess  public index.php  bootstrap start.php  Route Controller  bootstrap autoload.php  R e q u est  R  e  s  p  o  n  s  e  Views  Routes.php  app start ...  [ 22 ]   The preceding diagram shows how a request is handled between different parts of  the framework; here is a brief overview of what happens during different phases:  1.  When a user sends a page request such as  index or  about, it first hits  the .htaccess file in the public directory of the Laravel framework. The  .htaccess file ensures that each request hits the index.php file, which is  essential as only one entry point allows us to set all types of configurations  and filter requests.  2.  The index.php file first loads bootstrap autoload.php, which loads   Composer packages including Vendor autoload.php. It also loads   Laravel's custom class loader.  3.  Next, index.php loads  bootstrap start.php, and an application object is   created. This invokes the creation of a request object.  4.  Next, Laravel loads the environment and configurations, and it invokes the  router object that checks which route controller will be used for the request.  5.  Based on route controller response, an object is created and returned to    the user.  Now we have some understanding of how Laravel 4 works. Let's look at some  essential configurations.  Configuring Laravel As we already know, all of our configurations are stored at  app config. The way  Laravel handles configuration is by storing each configuration in the key-value store  as an array. This is a very flexible way of storing configurations as we can rewrite  them as and when needed.  Laravel manages different types of configurations in different types of files. These are  as follows:     app.php: This file contains time zone settings, language settings,    and debug settings.     auth.php: This file contains the basic authentication settings.    database.php: This file contains settings for databases. It will have  information such as the username, password, and URL for where   we could connect.  [ 23 ]   Here is an example of the workbench configuration file that Laravel provides:  <?php  return array     'name' => '',    'email' => '',  ;  The preceding configuration is used by Laravel when we generate a new package via  the artisan workbench command. We can get this configuration value anywhere in  our project via option. An example of this is as follows:  $option = Config::get 'workbench.name' ;  We can even set the configuration as follows:  $option = Config::set 'workbench.name','Taylor' ;  On top of this, Laravel also allows us to set our own configuration files. You can  create your own configuration file in  app config . You can load the configuration  using the preceding command, but instead of workbench, use the filename without  an extension and key from the config file; for example:  $option = Config::get 'custom.name' ;  Configuring the Laravel environment One of the most painful aspects that a lot of web developers have is of   managing multiple environments, such as their local development environment,  prestaging dev environment, staging environment, and live environment. Often  developers have to struggle a lot to manage each environment and its configurations,  such as database settings, debug settings, and a lot of these settings.  Laravel makes it very easy to manage multiple environments in your project. You  can define environments within the config directory. For each environment, you  can create an environment-specific directory and store configuration files such as  database, session, or the mail settings file, which will override your default settings  provided in  app config  for that environment. But you will be wondering how  Laravel recognizes which environment to use.  [ 24 ]   Laravel makes it very simple for us. It reads the  bootstrap start.php file and   loads the environment array to determine which environment to load. See the   following example:  $env = $app->detectEnvironment array    'local' => array 'computername' ,   'dev' => array 'http:  85.205.120.11' ,   'Staging' => array 'http:  stage.oursite.com' ,   'Live' => array 'http:   oursite.com' ,   ;  Here as you can see, 'local' is the environment name, and you need to create that  directory in your  app conf  directory. Within that directory, you can specify all  your settings for a local environment. Laravel will try to match the computername  or http host and use an environment that matches the value pair given in this  environment and load its settings.  Here one thing to remember is that we just need to provide the key-value pairs   that we actually want to override. Laravel will load another configuration from   the default file provided in default configuration files.  Refer to the following screenshot on how you can manage different environments in  your project:  If you noticed, you may find that two directories are already available in the default  Laravel framework files:     testing    packages  [ 25 ]   The testing directory contains unit-testing-specific configurations that run when  you perform unit testing via the artisan command line. The packages directory will  contain all package-specific configurations that you need to override from the given  package. You can even define an environment-specific package configuration file   that overrides default package configurations provided in the package by placing   it in  app config packages vendor package environment.  You can also detect which environment you are in your code using the following line  of code:  $environment = App::environment  ;  You can use this information for things such as checking whether we are in   the development environment and whether to send an e-mail or not based   on the environment.  Now let's look at some default configurations you may need to edit, such as a  database or an application.  Configuring the database The default database configuration in Laravel 4 is stored in the database.php file  placed at app config. Here you can create all of your database-connection-related  configurations. Laravel 4 supports the following databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL,  SQLite, and SQL server. You can create your environment-specific file in  app  config environmentname database.php.  Here are some settings you need to configure for your database in app config  database.php. The first setting you need to configure is which database you are  going to use in your project. You can change that using the following line of code:  'default' => 'mysql',  Here default is used to indicate which connection to use from the connections array  you specify in the database.php file. You are telling Laravel 4 to use mysql settings  provided in the connections array. Here is how connections array works:  'connections' => array       'log_sqlite' => array        'driver'   => 'sqlite',       'database' => __DIR__.' .. database production.sqlite',       'prefix'   => '',      ,     'result_sqlite' => array        'driver'   => 'sqlite',  [ 26 ]         'database' => __DIR__.' .. database production.sqlite',       'prefix'   => '',      ,      'mysql' => array        'driver'    => 'mysql',       'host'      => 'localhost',       'database'  => 'database',       'username'  => 'root',       'password'  => 'rootpassword',       'charset'   => 'utf8',       'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',       'prefix'    => '',      ,  ;  In the preceding example, you can see we have defined all the connections we need  to use in our project; of course, you can add other connections as well. So if you are  using a SQL server, the config file already provides you with all the settings in the  sqlsrv key. Remember that the default database provided in the default key will  be used when you are querying the database via the DB class or Eloquent. To use  another connection, you need to specify which database to use during querying or  in the Eloquent object. Here is a sample database query which will load SQLite  database and query it:  $users = DB::connection 'log_sqlite' ->select 'select * from log' ;  Or if you are using Eloquent:  class log extends Eloquent {     public static $connection = 'log_sqlite'; }  So this is how you can manage multiple connections via the configuration file and  Laravel 4.  Configuring the application Application-related configurations are stored in app config app.php. We will see  how they affect our application. Here is brief list of configurations in app.php file:     Debug: This is used for getting a detailed error message with a stack trace. You  should always turn off this when you are going live with your application. To  turn off you can set it as False.     URL: This should be the root of your application. It is used by the artisan   command-line tool for artisan tasks, that is, dev.test.com.  [ 27 ]      Time zone: It is used for setting the time zone. This will be used when   running the date time functions by Laravel as a base time zone, that is,   in UTC.     Locale: This is used for setting the language locale you are going to use in  your application. For example, you can set it as es for Spanish. You would  need to create a language directory at  app lang es and specify the  language files.     Key: This is used by Laravel 4 to encrypt things such as passwords and   cookies. It should be a long and random key. By default, Laravel will  generate the key for us. At times when you deploy or change the session or  cookie values, you can generate it via the artisan command; we will discuss  this in detail in the next chapter.     Providers: This is for the list of service providers you want to autoload.    If you see the list, this is how Laravel 4 autoloads all the components.  Artisan – magic of Laravel 4 Artisan is the command-line tool provided in Laravel 4. It does a lot of painful tasks  that web developers would have previously had to do manually. Here is a list of  tasks Laravel 4 can help you with:     Generating a boilerplate controller    Managing database with migrations    Filling the database with basic data for testing via database seeds    Running unit tests    Routing    Configuring an application    Creating new artisan commands    Creating a new workbench package  Artisan resides at the root of our framework directory. You would need to use  command line to access artisan commands. So open your command directory   and change the directory to where you have extracted the framework and run   the following command. Say you have installed the web server at  var www and  copied Laravel at  var www l4, then execute the following command:  $ cd  var www l4  $ php artisan list  The preceding command will show a list of available artisan commands.  [ 28 ]   Generating a boilerplate controller To generate a boilerplate controller along with all the methods, execute the   following command:  $ php artisan controller make:user  This will generate the controller at  app controller user.php and user.php.   It will have the entire code you will basically need to create a controller with all   the methods for a boilerplate. Later in Chapter 3, Creating a simple CRUD Application  in Hours, we will see how it really helps us in developing apps quickly.  Managing database with migrations Migration is a version management tool for database. It allows you to create a  schema for each of your table, and a new migration file is created for each change  that is made to your database. We will see migrations in detail in later chapters.  Laravel provides the following commands to manage migrations:  Command $ php artisan migrate:install $ php artisan migrate:make $ php artisan migrate:refresh $ php artisan migrate:reset $ php artisan migrate:rollback  Description Creates the migration repository Creates a new migration file Resets and reruns all the migrations Rollback all the database migrations Rollback the last database migration  Filling the database with basic data for testing via  database seeds Artisan allows us to feed data with the database seeds file in the app database seeds  directory. It will execute all the database seeds when we run the following command:  $ PHP artisan db:seed  Running unit tests Artisan allows us to run unit tests defined in the app tests directory. The test class  should extend TestCase. You can use the methods just as PHPUnit. To run unit  tests, you would need to execute the following command:  $ php artisan test  [ 29 ]   Maintenance mode One of the new features of Laravel 4 is that we can now switch on or off the  maintenance mode. This really helps when you are upgrading or maintaining   your application. To enable the maintenance mode, simply execute the down   artisan command as follows:  To disable the maintenance mode, use the up command as follows:  $ php artisan down  $ php artisan up  Summary So we have learned how Laravel can be installed in different environments, Laravel's  structure, and lots of configurations that will come handy when we start our project.  In later chapters, we will see the following artisan commands in detail:     Creating new artisan commands    Creating a new workbench package  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create CRUD applications with Laravel.  [ 30 ]   Creating a Simple CRUD  Application in Hours  Now that we know the basics of Laravel 4, let's start working our way into our first  simple CRUD application. We will see how Controllers and routes work and how we  can create views. Then we will build our first CRUD application in hours and not in  days via some artisan-powered magic. Here are the topics we are going to cover in  this chapter.     Getting familiar with Laravel 4    Creating a simple CRUD application with Laravel 4  Listing the users        Creating new users    Editing user information    Deleting user information    Adding pagination to our list users   Getting familiar with Laravel 4 I assume you have followed the instructions provided in Chapter 2, Let's Begin   the Journey, and installed Laravel 4. Now if everything is installed correctly you   will be greeted by this beautiful screen, as shown in the following screenshot,   when you hit your browser with http:  localhost laravel public or   http:  localhost   public:  Now that you can see we have installed Laravel correctly, you would be thinking  how can I use Laravel? How do I create apps with Laravel? Or you might be  wondering why and how this screen is shown to us? What's behind the scenes?   How Laravel 4 sets this screen for us? So let's review that.  When you visit the http:  localhost laravel public, Laravel 4 detects that   you are requesting for the default route which is " ". You would be wondering   what route is this if you are not familiar with the MVC world. Let me explain that.  In traditional web applications we use a URL with page name, say for example:  http:  www.shop.com products.php  The preceding URL will be bound to the page products.php in the web server  hosting shop.com. We can assume that it displays all the products from the database.  Now say for example, we want to display a category of books from all the products.  You will say, "Hey, it's easy!" Just add the category ID into the URL as follows:  http:  www.shop.com products.php?cat=1  Then put the filter in the page products.php that will check whether the category ID  is passed. This sounds perfect, but what about pagination and other categories? Soon  clients will ask you to change one of your category page layouts to change and you  will hack your code more. And your application URLs will look like the following:     http:  www.shop.com products.php?cat=2    http:  www.shop.com products.php?cat=3&page=1&total=20    http:  www.shop.com products.php?cat=3&page=1&total=20&layout=1  [ 32 ]   If you look at your code after six months, you would be looking at one huge  products.php page with all of your business and view code mixed in one large file.  You wouldn't remember those easy hacks you did in order to manage client requests.  On top of that, a client or client's SEO executive might ask you why are all the URLs  so badly formatted? Why are they are not human friendly? In a way they are right.  Your URLs are not as pretty as the following:     http:  www.shop.com products    http:  www.shop.com products books    http:  www.shop.com products cloths  The preceding URLs are human friendly. Users can easily change categories  themselves. In addition to that, your client's SEO executives will love you   for those URLs just as a search engine likes those URLs. You might be puzzled now; how do you do that? Here my friend MVC  Model View  Controller  comes into the picture. MVC frameworks are meant specifically for doing  this. It's one of the core goals of using the MVC framework in web development.  So let's go back to our topic "routing"; routing means decoupling your URL request  and assigning it to some specific action via your controller route. In the Laravel  MVC world, you register all your routes in a route file and assign an action to them.  All your routes are generally found at  app routes.php.  If you open your newly downloaded Laravel installation's routes.php file, you will  notice the following code:  Route::get ' ', function   {   return View::make 'hello' ; } ;  The preceding code registers a route with   means default URL with view  app  views hello.php. Here view is just an .html file. Generally view files are used for  managing your presentation logic. So check  app views hello.php, or better let's  create an about page for our application ourselves.  Let's register a route about by adding the following code to app routes.php:  Route::get 'about', function   {   return View::make 'about' ; } ;  [ 33 ]   We would need to create a view at app views about.php. So create the file and  insert the following code in to it:               About my little app         Hello Laravel 4!      Welcome to the Awesomeness!        Now head over to your browser and run http:  localhost laravel public  about. You will be greeted with the following output:  Hello Laravel 4! Welcome to the Awesomeness! Isn't it easy? You can define your route and separate the view for each type of  request. Now you might be thinking what about Controllers as the term MVC has  C for Controllers? And isn't it difficult to create routes and views for each action?  What advantage will we have if we use the preceding pattern? Well we found that  mapping URLs to a particular action in comparison to the traditional one-file-based  method. Well first you are organizing your code way better as you will have actions  responding to specific URLs mapped in the route file.  Any developer can recognize routes and see what's going on with your code.  Developers do not have to check many files to see which files are using which code.  Your presentation logic is separated, so if a designer wants to change something, he  will know he needs to look at the view folder of your application.  Now about Controllers; they allow us to group related actions into a single class.   So in a typical MVC project, there will be one user Controller that will be responsible  for all user-related actions, such as registering, logging in, editing a profile, and  changing the password. Generally routes are used for small applications or creating  static pages quickly. Controllers provide more in-depth options to create a group of  methods that belong to a specific class related to the application.  [ 34 ]   Here is how we can create Controllers in Laravel 4. Open your app routes.php file  and add following code:  Route::get 'contact', 'Pages@contact' ;  The preceding code will register the http:  yourapp.com contact URL in the  Pages Controller's contact method. So let's write a page's Controller. Create a  file PagesController.php at  app controllers  in your Laravel 4 installation  directory. The following are the contents of the PagesController.php file:  <?php class PagesController extends BaseController {       public function contact     {     return View::make 'hello' ;   }  }  Here BaseController is a class provided by Laravel so we can place our Controller  shared logic in a common class. And it extends the framework's Controller class and  provides the Controller functionality. You can check Basecontroller.php in the  Controller's directory to add shared logic.  Controllers versus routes So you are wondering now, "What's the difference between Controllers and   routes?" Which one to use? Controllers or routes? Here are the differences   between Controllers and routes:     A disadvantage of routes is that you can't share code between routes, as  routes work via Closure functions. And the scope of a function is bound  within function.     Controllers give a structure to your code. You can define your system in   well-grouped classes, which are divided in such a way that it makes sense,  for example, users, dashboard, products, and so on.     Compared to routes, Controllers have only one disadvantage and it's    that you have to create a file for each Controller; however, if you think in  terms of organizing the code in a large application, it makes more sense to  use Controllers.  [ 35 ]   Creating a simple CRUD application with  Laravel 4 Now as we have a basic understanding of how we can create pages, let's create a  simple CRUD application with Laravel 4. The application we want to create will  manage the users of our application. We will create the following list of features   for our application:     List users  read users from the database     Create new users    Edit user information    Delete user information    Adding pagination to the list of users  Now to start off with things, we would need to set up a database. So if you   have phpMyAdmin installed with your local web server setup, head over to   http:  localhost phpmyadmin; if you don't have phpMyAdmin installed,   use the MySQL admin tool workbench to connect with your database and   create a new database.  Now we need to configure Laravel 4 to connect with our database. So head over  to your Laravel 4 application folder, open  app config database.php, change  the MySQL array, and match your current database settings. Here is the MySQL  database array from database.php file:      'mysql' => array        'driver'    => 'mysql',       'host'      => 'localhost',       'database'  => ' ',       'username'  => 'root',       'password'  => ' ',       'charset'   => 'utf8',       'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',       'prefix'    => '',      ,  Now we are ready to work with the database in our application. Let's first create  the database table Users via the following SQL queries from phpMyAdmin or any  MySQL database admin tool;  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS 'users'     'id' int 10  unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,   'username' varchar 255  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,  [ 36 ]     'password' varchar 255  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,   'email' varchar 255  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,   'phone' varchar 255  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,   'name' varchar 255  COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,   'created_at' timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',   'updated_at' timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',   PRIMARY KEY  'id'    ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci AUTO_ INCREMENT=3 ;  Now let's seed some data into the Users table so when we fetch the users we won't  get empty results. Run the following queries into your database admin tool:  INSERT INTO 'users'  'id', 'username', 'password', 'email', 'phone',  'name', 'created_at', 'updated_at'  VALUES  1, 'john', 'johndoe', 'johndoe@gmail.com', '123456', 'John', '2013- 06-07 08:13:28', '2013-06-07 08:13:28' ,  2, 'amy', 'amy.deg', 'amy@outlook.com', '1234567', 'amy', '2013-06-07  08:14:49', '2013-06-07 08:14:49' ;  Later we will see how we can manage our database via Laravel  4's powerful migrations features. At the end of this chapter, I will  introduce you to why it's not a good practice to manually create SQL  queries and make changes to the database structure. And I know that  passwords should not be plain too!  Listing the users – read users from database Let's read users from the database. We would need to follow the steps described to  read users from database:     A route that will lead to our page    A controller that will handle our method    The Eloquent Model that will connect to the database    A view that will display our records in the template  So let's create our route at  app routes.php. Add the following line to the   routes.php file:  Route::resource 'users', 'UserController' ;  If you have noticed previously, we had Route::get for displaying our page  Controller. But now we are using resource. So what's the difference?  [ 37 ]   In general we face two types of requests during web projects: GET and POST. We  generally use these HTTP request types to manipulate our pages, that is, you will  check whether the page has any POST variables set; if not, you will display the user  form to enter data. As a user submits the form, it will send a POST request as we  generally define the   tag in our pages. Now based on page's  request type, we set the code to perform actions such as inserting user data into our  database or filtering records.  What Laravel provides us is that we can simply tap into either a GET or POST  request via routes and send it to the appropriate method. Here is an example for that:  Route::get ' register', 'UserController@showUserRegistration' ; Route::post ' register', 'UserController@saveUser' ;  See the difference here is we are registering the same URL,  register, but  we are defining its GET method so Laravel can call UserController class'  showUserRegistration method. If it's the POST method, Laravel should   call the saveUser method of the UserController class.  You might be wondering what's the benefit of it? Well six months later if you want to  know how something's happening in your app, you can just check out the routes. php file and guess which Controller and which method of Controller handles the part  you are interested in, developing it further or solving some bug. Even some other  developer who is not used to your project will be able to understand how things  work and can easily help move your project. This is because he would be able to  somewhat understand the structure of your application by checking routes.php.  Now imagine the routes you will need for editing, deleting, or displaying a user.  Resource Controller will save you from this trouble. A single line of route will map  multiple restful actions with our resource Controller. It will automatically map the  following actions with HTTP verbs:  HTTP VERB GET POST PUT DELETE  ACTION READ CREATE UPDATE DELETE  [ 38 ]  To know more about REST actions refer to   https:  blog.apigee.com detail restful_api_design.   On top of that you can actually generate your Controller via a simple command-line  artisan using the following command:  $ php artisan Usercontroller:make users  This will generate UsersController.php with all the RESTful empty methods, so  you will have an empty structure to play with. Here is what we will have after the  preceding command:  class UserController extends BaseController {     **    * Display a listing of the resource.    *    * @return Response    *    public function index     {          }     **    * Show the form for creating a new resource.    *    * @return Response    *    public function create     {          }     **    * Store a newly created resource in storage.    *    * @return Response    *    public function store     {          }     **    * Display the specified resource.    *    * @param  int  $id  [ 39 ]      * @return Response    *    public function show $id    {          }     **    * Show the form for editing the specified resource.    *    * @param  int  $id    * @return Response    *    public function edit $id    {          }     **    * Update the specified resource in storage.    *    * @param  int  $id    * @return Response    *    public function update $id    {          }     **    * Remove the specified resource from storage.    *    * @param  int  $id    * @return Response    *    public function destroy $id    {          }    }  [ 40 ]   Now let's try to understand what our single line route declaration created  relationship with our generated Controller.  HTTP VERB GET GET POST GET GET PUT DELETE  Path  Users  Users create  Users  Users {id}  Users {id} edit  Users {id}  Users {id}  Controller Action method Index Create Store Show  individual record  Edit Update Destroy  As you can see, resource Controller really makes your work easy. You don't have to  create lots of routes. Also Laravel 4's artisan-command-line generator can generate  resourceful Controllers, so you will write very less boilerplate code. And you can  also use the following command to view the list of all the routes in your project from  the root of your project, launching command line:  $ php artisan routes  Now let's get back to our basic task, that is, reading users. Well now we know that  we have UserController.php at  app controller with the index method, which  will be executed when somebody launches http:  localhost laravel public  users. So let's edit the Controller file to fetch data from the database.  Well as you might remember, we will need a Model to do that. But how do we define  one and what's the use of Models? You might be wondering, can't we just run the  queries? Well Laravel does support queries through the DB class, but Laravel also  has Eloquent that gives us our table as a database object, and what's great about  object is that we can play around with its methods. So let's create a Model.  If you check your path  app models User.php, you will already have a user Model  defined. It's there because Laravel provides us with some basic user authentication.  Generally you can create your Model using the following code:  class User extends Eloquent {}  Now in your controller you can fetch the user object using the following code:  $users = User::all  ; $users->toarray  ;  Yeah! It's that simple. No database connection! No queries! Isn't it magic? It's the  simplicity of Eloquent objects that many people like in Laravel.  [ 41 ]   But you have the following questions, right?     How does Model know which table to fetch?    How does Controller know what is a user?    How does the fetching of user records work? We don't have all the methods   in the User class, so how did it work?  Well models in Laravel use a lowercase, plural name of the class as the table name  unless another name is explicitly specified. So in our case, User was converted to a  lowercase user and used as a table to bind with the User class.  Models are automatically loaded by Laravel, so you don't have to include the reference  of the Model file. Each Model inherits an Eloquent instance that resolves methods  defined in the model.php file at vendor Laravel framework src Illumininate  Database Eloquent  like all, insert, update, delete and our user class inherit those  methods and as a result of this, we can fetch records via User::all  .  So now let's try to fetch users from our database via the Eloquent object. I am updating  the index method in our app controllers UsersController.php as it's the method  responsible as per the REST convention we are using via resource Controller.  public function index     {         $users = User::all  ;          return View::make 'users.index', compact 'users'  ;     }  Now let's look at the View part. Before that, we need to know about Blade. Blade   is a templating engine provided by Laravel. Blade has a very simple syntax, and   you can determine most of the Blade expressions within your view files as they   begin with @. To print anything with Blade, you can use the {{ $var }} syntax.   Its PHP-equivalent syntax would be:  Now back to our view; first of all, we need to create a view file at  app views users  index.blade.php, as our statement would return the view file from users.index. We  are passing a compact users array to this view. So here is our index.blade.php file:     @section 'main'    All Users    {{ link_to_route 'users.create', 'Add new user'  }}   @if  $users->count           [ 42 ]                                            Username           Password           Email           Phone           Name                                                 @foreach  $users as $user                                         {{ $user->username }}             {{ $user->password }}             {{ $user->email }}             {{ $user->phone }}             {{ $user->name }}                       {{ link_to_route 'users.edit', 'Edit',  array $user->id , array 'class' => 'btn btn-info'   }}                                  {{ Form::open array 'method'  => 'DELETE', 'route' => array 'users.destroy', $user->id    }}                                                    {{ Form::submit 'Delete', array 'class' =>  'btn btn-danger'   }}                         {{ Form::close   }}                                                     @endforeach                                       @else     There are no users @endif  @stop  Let's see the code line by line. In the first line we are extending the user layouts via  the Blade template syntax @extends. What actually happens here is that Laravel will  load the layout file at  app views layouts user.blade.php first.  [ 43 ]   Here is our user.blade.php file's code:                              <link href="  netdna.bootstrapcdn.com twitter-bootstrap 2.3.1  css bootstrap-combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet">                       table form { margin-bottom: 0; }             form ul { margin-left: 0; list-style: none; }             .error { color: red; font-style: italic; }             body { padding-top: 20px; }                                               @if  Session::has 'message'                                          {{ Session::get 'message'  }}                                @endif              @yield 'main'                       Now in this file we are loading the Twitter bootstrap framework for styling our page,  and via yield 'main'  we can load the main section from the view that is loaded.  So here when we load http:  localhost laravel public users, Laravel will  first load the users.blade.php layout view and then the main section will be loaded  from index.blade.php.  Now when we get back to our index.blade.php, we have the main section   defined as @section 'main' , which will be used by Laravel to load it into our  layout file. This section will be merged into the layout file where we have put the   @yield  'main'  section.  [ 44 ]   We are using Laravel's link_to_route method to link to our route, that is,    users create. This helper will generate an HTML link with the correct URL.   In the next step, we are looping through all the user records and displaying it   simply in a tabular format. Now if you have followed everything, you will be   greeted by the following screen:  Creating new users Now as we have listed our users, let's write the code for creating new users. To  create a new user, we will need to create the Controller method and bind the view  for displaying the new user form. We would need to create the Controller method  for saving the user too. Now as we have bound the resourceful Controller, we don't  need to create separate routes for each of our request. Laravel will handle that part if  we use REST methods.  So first let's edit the controller at  app controllers UsersController.php to add  a method for displaying the view:      public function create       {         return View::make 'users.create' ;     }  This will call a view at  app views users create.blade.php. So let's define our  create.blade.php view as follows:  @extends 'layouts.users'   @section 'main'    Create User   {{ Form::open array 'route' => 'users.store'   }}                   [ 45 ]               {{ Form::label 'name', 'Name:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'name'  }}                                  {{ Form::label 'username', 'Username:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'username'  }}                                  {{ Form::label 'password', 'Password:'  }}             {{ Form::password 'password'  }}                                  {{ Form::label 'password', 'Confirm Password:'  }}             {{ Form::password 'password_confirmation'  }}                                          {{ Form::label 'email', 'Email:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'email'  }}                                  {{ Form::label 'phone', 'Phone:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'phone'  }}                                  {{ Form::submit 'Submit', array 'class' => 'btn'   }}                 {{ Form::close   }}  @if  $errors->any                  {{ implode '', $errors->all ' :message<  li>'   }}       @endif  @stop  [ 46 ]   Let's try to understand our preceding view. Here we are extending the users   layout we created in our List Users section. Now in the main section, we are   using Laravel's Form helper to generate our form. This helper generates HTML   code via its methods such as label, text, and submit.  Refer to the following code:  {{ Form::open array 'route' => 'users.store'   }}  The preceding code will generate the following HTML code:  <form method="POST" action="http:  localhost users"   accept-charset="UTF-8">  As you can see it's really convenient for us to not worry about linking things  correctly. Now let's create our store method to store our form data into our   users table:  public function store       {         $input = Input::all  ;         $validation = Validator::make $input, User::$rules ;          if  $validation->passes            {             User::create $input ;              return Redirect::route 'users.index' ;         }          return Redirect::route 'users.create'              ->withInput               ->withErrors $validation              ->with 'message', 'There were validation errors.' ;     }  Here we are first validating all the input that came from the user. The Input::all     function fetches all the $_GET and $_POST variables and puts it into a single array.  The reason why we are creating the single input array is so we can check that array  against validation rules' array. Laravel provides a very simple Validation class  that can be used to check validations. We could use it to check whether validations  provided in the rules array are followed by the input array by using   the following line of code:  $validation = Validator::make  $input, User::$rules ;  [ 47 ]   Rules can be defined in an array with validation attributes separated by the   column "". Here we are using User::$rules where User is our Model and   it will have following code:  class User extends Eloquent {    protected $guarded = array 'id' ;   protected $fillable = array 'name', 'email' ;    public static $rules = array      'name' => 'requiredmin:5',     'email' => 'requiredemail'    ; }  As you can observe we have defined two rules mainly for name and e-mail   input fields. If you are wondering about $guarded and $fillable variables, these  variables are used to prevent mass assignment. When you pass an array into your  Model's create and update methods, Laravel tries to match the right columns and  sets values in the database. Now for instance, if a malicious user sends a hidden  input named id and changes his ID via the update method of your form, it could be  a huge security hole; to prevent this, we should define the $guarded and $fillable  arrays. The $guarded array will guard the columns defined in the guarded array,  that is, it will prevent anyone from changing values in that column. The $fillable  array will only allow elements defined in $fillable to be updated.  Now we can use the $validation instance we created to check for validations.  $result = $validation->passes  ; echo $result;    True or false  If you see our code now, we are checking for validation via the passes   method in  our Store   method of UserController. Now if validation gets passed, we can use  our user Model to store data into our database. All you need to do is call the Create  method of the Model class with the $input array. So refer to the following code:  User::create $input ;  The preceding code will store our $input array into the database; yes, it's equivalent  to your SQL query.  Insert into user name,password,email,city  values  x,x,..,x ;  [ 48 ]   Here we have to fill either the $fillable or $guarded array in the model,  otherwise, Laravel will throw a mass assignment exception. Laravel's Eloquent  object automatically matches our input array with the database and creates a query  based on our input array. Don't you think this is a simple way to store input into the  database? If user data is inserted, we are using Laravel's redirect method to redirect  it to our list of users' pages. If validation fails, we are sending all of the input with  errors from the validation object into our create users form.  Editing user information Now as we learned how easy it is to add and list users. Let's jump into editing a user.  In our list users view we have the edit link with the following code:  {{ link_to_route 'users.edit', 'Edit', array $user->id , array 'class'  => 'btn btn-info'   }}  Here, the link_to_route function will generate a link  users   edit,   which will call the resourceful Controller user, and Controller will bind it   with the edit method.  So here is the code for editing a user. First of all we are handling the edit request by  adding the following code to our UsersController:      public function edit $id      {         $user = User::find $id ;         if  is_null $user           {             return Redirect::route 'users.index' ;         }         return View::make 'users.edit', compact 'user'  ;     }  So when the edit request is fired, it will hit the edit method described in the  preceding code snippet. We would need to find whether the user exists in the  database. So we use our user model to query the ID using the following line of code:  $user = User::find $id ;  Eloquent object's find method will query the database just like a normal SQL.  Select * from users where id = $id  Then we will check whether the object we received is empty or not. If it is empty, we  would just redirect the user to our list user's interface. If it is not empty, we would  direct the user to the user's edit view with our Eloquent object as a compact array.  [ 49 ]   So let's create our edit user view at app views users edit.blade.php, as follows:  @extends 'users.scaffold'   @section 'main'    Edit User  {{ Form::model $user, array 'method' => 'PATCH', 'route' =>  array 'users.update', $user->id    }}                             {{ Form::label 'username', 'Username:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'username'  }}                                 {{ Form::label 'password', 'Password:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'password'  }}                                 {{ Form::label 'email', 'Email:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'email'  }}                                 {{ Form::label 'phone', 'Phone:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'phone'  }}                                 {{ Form::label 'name', 'Name:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'name'  }}                                 {{ Form::submit 'Update', array 'class' => 'btn btn- info'   }}             {{ link_to_route 'users.show', 'Cancel', $user->id,  array 'class' => 'btn'   }}                 {{ Form::close   }}  @if  $errors->any                  {{ implode '', $errors->all ' :message<  li>'   }}       @endif  @stop  [ 50 ]   Here we are extending our users' layout as always and defining the main section.  Now in the main section, we are using the Form helper to generate a proper REST  request for our controller.  {{ Form::model $user, array 'method' => 'PATCH', 'route' =>  array 'users.update', $user->id    }}  Now, you may have not dealt with the method PATCH as we only know of two  protocols, GET and POST, as most browsers generally support only these two  methods. The REST method for editing is PATCH, and what Laravel does is that it  creates a hidden token so it knows which method to call. So the preceding code  generates the following code:  <form method="POST" action="http:  ch3.sr users 1" accept- charset="UTF-8">    It actually fires a POST method for browsers that are not capable for handling   the PATCH method. Now, when a user submits this form, it will send a request   to the update method of UsersController via the resourceful Controller we   set in routes.php.  Here is the update method of UsersController:  public function update $id      {         $input = Input::all  ;         $validation = Validator::make $input, User::$rules ;         if  $validation->passes            {             $user = User::find $id ;             $user->update $input ;             return Redirect::route 'users.show', $id ;         } return Redirect::route 'users.edit', $id              ->withInput               ->withErrors $validation              ->with 'message', 'There were validation errors.' ;     }  Here Laravel will pass the ID of the user we are editing in the update method. We  can use this ID to find the user via our user model's Eloquent object's find method.  Then we will update the Eloquent object with an input array just like we did in the  insert operation.  [ 51 ]   Deleting user information To delete a user we can use the destroy method. If you go to our user lists view, you  can find the following delete link's generation code:  {{ Form::open array 'method' => 'DELETE', 'route' => array 'users. destroy', $user->id    }} {{ Form::submit 'Delete', array 'class' => 'btn btn-danger'   }} {{ Form::close   }}  The preceding code is handled by Laravel similar to the way in which it handles the  PATCH method. Laravel will generate a post request with the hidden method token  set as PATCH, which it can recognize when it hits the Laravel request object.  At UsersController this request will hit the destroy   method as follows:      public function destroy $id      {         User::find $id ->delete  ;         return Redirect::route 'users.index' ;     }  Laravel will directly send id to the destroy method, so all we have to do is use our  user model and delete the record with its delete method. If you noticed Eloquent  allows us to chain methods. Isn't it sweet? So there would be no queries but just one  line to delete a user.  That's one of the reasons to use Eloquent objects in your projects. It allows you   to quickly interact with the database and you can use objects to match your   business logic.  Adding pagination to our list users One of the painful tasks most developers face often is that of pagination.   With Laravel it's no more the case, as Laravel provides a simple approach   to set pagination to your pages.  Let's try to implement pagination to our list user's method. To set pagination   we can use the paginate method with Laravel's Eloquent object. Here is how   we can do that:  public function index   {   $users = User::paginate 5 ;   return View::make 'users.index', compact 'users'  ; }  [ 52 ]   The preceding code is the index method of the UsersController class, which we  were using previously for getting all the users with User::all  . We just used the  paginate method to find five records from the database. Now in our list users view,  we can use the following code to display pagination links:  {{ echo $users->links  ; }}  Here the links   method will generate pagination links for you. And  best part, Laravel will manage the code for pagination. So all you  have to do is use paginate method with your eloquent object and links  method to display generated links.  Summary So we have set up our simple CRUD application and now we know how easy it is  with Laravel to set up CRUD operations. We have seen Eloquent Laravel's database  ORM that makes working with a database simple and easy. We have learned how to  list users, create new users, edit users, delete users, and how to add pagination to our  application. In the next chapter let's dive into a more complicated application.  [ 53 ]    Building a Real-life  Application with Laravel 4 –  The Foldagram  One of our friends Jordan needs a web application for his startup thefoldagram.com.  Foldagram is all about delivering awesome pictures with messages from anywhere in  the world to your family and friends in a nicely crafted Foldagram via mail, that too  without any of the hassle of managing visits to a mail office in a foreign country. Just  create a Foldagram online, upload your picture, type your message, and then preview  and send it instantly. Foldagram will deliver your mail via its own mail system.  So I met him and did some basic analysis of what he wants in thefoldagram. com. I used mix agile techniques to define the requirements. Here are some of the  requirements in terms of stories that we need to make thefoldagram.com work.  As a user, I should be able to do the following:     Create Foldagram from any page on the site    Preview Foldagram to see how it will look before sending it    View my cart easily at any time    Pay for my order via my credit card    View my order status    View my past orders    Purchase credits    Subscribe to the e-mail newsletter   As an admin, I should be able to do the following:     Manage orders    Export orders which are paid but are in the queue for printing    Add credits to the users    Manage users    Reset user passwords    Block a user  Agile development requires constant iteration and testing, getting a minimum   viable product out in the open for users to start using, allowing you to take in   their feedback and iterate further.  Here, as a part of our first iteration, we will work on the frontend sprint. We will try  to finish the following things in the frontend of our site:     Preparing the schema    Setting up the Home page    Setting up other pages    Creating a Foldagram form    Creating a Newsletter section  Now, during each sprint, we create mockups of a page layout before starting any  code. If a client approves that mockup, we will go ahead with the coding. That  mockup will give the client a certain idea about how the site will look like after the  current sprint. Generally, mockups can be built on paper or via software such as  Pencil  http:  pencil.evolus.vn  . There are two main advantages of mockups.  It gives a designer a rough idea on how to design certain elements of the pages. It  also helps in dealing with the changes that generally come when the clients don't  have mockups. You will develop a lot of stuff, but the clients will ask for a lot of  small changes as they have no idea how it will turn out.  [ 56 ]   Preparing the schema So let's prepare a database for our current sprint, meanwhile the designer will  have designs for our first sprint. Laravel 4 provides us with migrations to manage  our database. Migrations are like version management for your database. For  each change in your database, you will prepare a migration file which will hold  specifically what we are changing in our database. It will also store what should  happen if we want to revoke that database change.  This is particularly useful in agile projects as we constantly iterate, and changes are  part of a project. As we try to manage our project in sprints, we can deploy database  changes quickly for the staging live servers on the client site or demo area. This  eliminates manual fiddling with the database, and you will be saved by that one field  which you tend to miss often in deployment. This is because the migration files hold  the information of all the changes. Laravel manages migration files so that you can  revert or apply changes to your project instantly.  Let's see how we can use migrations. To create a new migration file, you can use an  artisan command from your project root, which will generate a migration file  with the correct class information:  $ php artisan migrate:make create_users_table --table=users --create  This will generate a migration file 2013_07_19_222248_create_user_table.php   filename will depend on table name you will give in command, or the --table  parameter and current date time  at app\database\migrations\. Now if you look  at the file, you will see the following code:  <?php  use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint; use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;  class CreateUsersTable extends Migration {    public function up     {         Schema::create 'users', function Blueprint $table      {               $table->increments 'id' ;  [ 57 ]             $table->timestamps  ;     } ;   }          public function down     {         Schema::drop 'users' ;   }  }    Here, the up function will be used when you run the migration and the down function  will be used when you rollback your database. Laravel provides us the Schema class  which manages all database related work such as creating or removing tables and  adding fields to the existing table. In the previous example, as you can see we are  creating the users table via Schema::create. Laravel puts sensible defaults such as  making the ID field as the primary key, auto increment via the increments method,  adding the timestamp fields such as created_at, and adding updated_at via the  timestamps   method. Similarly, Schema::drop will remove the users table from  the database.  You can add columns in the Schema::create method if you want. So, let's add our  user table columns into it:  public function up   {   Schema::create 'users', function Blueprint $table    {       $table->increments 'id' ;       $table->string 'username','12' ;       $table->string 'password','16' ;       $table->string 'email','40' ;       $table->string 'phone','12' ->nullable  ;       $table->string 'name','40' ;       $table->boolean 'blocked' ->default 0 ;       $table->timestamps  ;   } ; }  [ 58 ]   Now, we can run the artisan command:  $ php artisan migrate  This will run all migration files and create tables or other database changes specified  in the migration files. In our case, this command will create the users table with the  columns which we specified. But what if we want to rollback our migration? Well we  can rollback our migration with the following command:  $ php artisan migrate:rollback  Now in our case, the preceding command will drop the users table from the  database, as we have specified in down method.  You might think it's lot of work. Why can't we just set up the database tables directly  via MySQL or PHPMyAdmin? Well, imagine you have multiple members on team  and all have different tables which are required for that code. Then how do you  manage the databases? Or imagine you have already deployed your project and you  are working on second version of the project. You can't remember each change you  make in database. So, it's better to create migration files and run them when you  deploy your code in production.  Laravel also provides a Seeder class, which allows us to seed data into our tables.  this becomes very important as you can insert data into tables whenever you want  to test your application, or when you don't have backend and you want to start with  having some sort of data into your tables.  Laravel comes with a DatabaseSeeder class defined at app\database\seeds\ DatabaseSeeder.php. You can use this class to run your seeds. Here's an example  for our users table.  class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder {     public function run       {         $this->call 'UserTableSeeder' ;         $this->command->info 'User' table seeded!' ;     } } class UserTableSeeder extends Seeder {   public function run     {  [ 59 ]           $hashed = Hash::make 'secret' ;        DB::table 'users''' ->insert            array 'username'=>'James','email' =>           'james@gmail.com','password'=>$hashed ,           array 'username'=>'Steve','email' =>           'stever@yahoo.com','password'=>$hashed       ;   } }  To run the previous seed file, we need to run following artisan command:  $ php artisan db:seed  This will run our seed file and insert two records into the database. If you note  carefully, we are using Hash::make to encrypt our password. Here are the other  table schemas we will need for this sprint.  Subscribe the table schema that we will need, so that the users can subscribe to   the site:  Schema::create 'subscribe', function Blueprint $table  {             $table->increments 'id' ;             $table->string 'email' ;             $table->timestamps  ; } ;  Foldagram table schema for storing Foldagram's created by the user is as follows:  Schema::create 'foldagram', function Blueprint $table  {             $table->increments 'id' ;             $table->text 'message' ;             $table->string 'image' ;             $table->boolean 'status' ;             $table->integer 'user_id' ;                    $table->integer 'exported' ;             $table->timestamps  ; } ;  [ 60 ]   Setting up the layout As we have completed the schema for this sprint, we now have designs available  which are approved by the client. So, we can start working on setting up the layout.  But first let's look at the design so we can decide how we can work out our layouts.  Home page of thefoldagram.com  [ 61 ]   Here is our Home page design. We would need to divide this Home page into   Blade sections.  Inner page layout  Here, from the screenshots Home page of Foldagram.com and Inner page layout we can  see that we have an almost similar header and footer in both types of pages, except  for a top banner in the inner pages. We will achieve layouts via the Blade Templating  engine provided by Laravel. We will create the layout templates for the Home page  and the inner page via Blade, and then we will mix the dynamic portion of the  templates via sections and yield functionality from the Blade Templating engine.  [ 62 ]   So let's start by creating layouts for our application. Firstly, we will create a layout  for our Home page as it's different from all other pages. I prefer to store all layouts in  the layout directory under the views directory. So, I will create default.blade.php  under app\views\layouts for our Home page. Here is the code for the Home   page layout:     "      "    "    {{ $title }}     "   <link href=''  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Droid+Sans:400,700''  rel='stylesheet''' type='text css'''>        {{ HTML::style 'css' bootstrap.css'  }} {{ HTML::style 'css' style.css'  }}   {{ HTML::style 'css' slider.css'  }}   {{ HTML::script 'js' slider.js'  }}s       "  This is the header part of template. You will notice that we are using HTML::style  and HTML::script of the HTML helper to get the CSS and JavaScript files from our    public directory. You should use them so you don't have to manually edit the  paths if the project location changes or when you upload your application and   make it live.   "       "      "        <''"img class=""logo"" src="{{"           URL::asset 'images' logo.png'  }}"'"  >             "                          "Create                  Foldagram                 {{ link_to_route 'pcredit', 'Purchase Credits'                   }}                {{ link_to_route 'cart', 'Cart'  }}                {{ link_to_route 'contact', 'Contact'  }}                {{ link_to_route 'userlogin', 'Login'  }}   [ 63 ]                 {{ link_to_route 'register', 'Register'  }}                           "             <a href=""https:  www.facebook.com TheFoldagram""                 target="_"blank"><"img class=""facebook"" src="{{"                 URL::to ' '  }} img img_trans.png""  >              <a href=""https:  twitter.com thefoldagram""                 target="_"blank"><"img class=""twit"" src="{{"                 URL::to ' '  }} img img_trans.png""  >              <a href=""https:  pinterest.com thefoldagram ""                 target="_"blank"><"img class=""ping"" src="{{"                 URL::to ' '  }} img img_trans.png""  >               The preceding block starts with our main container which holds everything in our  template. You will notice that we are using the URL helper function URL::Asset to  manage the paths of our public directory. If you are setting up a template, always  remember not to use absolute paths. Use the Laravel helper functions to manage  paths. So, when you want to move location you don't have to worry about paths.   For managing our top navigation, we are using the link_to_route helper. This  manages navigation links by putting the correct path of the router, and we don't  have to manually put the paths of our pages. This is again an elegant solution for  managing paths, as we will always have routes for each of our pages:      @yield 'inner-banner'          "           @yield 'content'           Here, yield is used so the other page can override this section. inneri-banner is the  dynamic section for the inner pages. It's not necessary to have that section for pages  which extends the main layout. content will be the main section and main content  of the page.   "    "     {{ Form::open array 'url' => 'subscribe'  ; }}  [ 64 ]      {{ Form::label 'something', 'Sign' Up for Our Newsletter and  Updates!' ; }}    {{ Form::text 'email', null, array 'class' => 'input-large',        'placeholder' => '  ; }}    {{ Form::submit 'Subscribe' ; }}    {{ Form::close  ; }}         The preceding code is used for adding the subscribe e-mail section on every page of  the site.   "            "                                    {{ link_to_route 'contact', 'Contact'                        }}                     {{ link_to_route 'about', 'About Us'                        }}                     {{ link_to_route 'login', 'Log In'                        }}                      {{ link_to_route 'register', 'Register'                        }}                                          "                    Foldagram is patent pending                     &copy;Copyright All Encompassing Productions                       llc, 2012                                      [ 65 ]   And the footer section is the last, with the footer navigation and text.  The {{ $class }} used in the body tag is something you can  use to add a class, which allows you to add custom CSS based on  page. Generally, you will pass the class with other data via route or  controller when you are calling the view.  URL::to ' '  will return the URL of the Home page of our application. Similarly,  the link_to_route   helper method will generate the correct URL to the route that  we pass as an argument.  Now, the main part of template is where @yield 'content'  is written. At this  point, the content section from the other view will be rendered. Let's see how exactly  this process works. First, we will create view for our Home page. Then, we will  create the content section and extend the main template. So, our Home view will be  at app views home.blade.php. Here it is:  @extends 'layouts.default'   @section 'content'           "              "                 "                  "                    "                     "                            "                     New Visitors: Welcome!

We are using the Flexslider slider for that, and it requires us to markup our  HTML like the previous code.

The previous section is used for three sections of the Home page displayed in   the layout:  @stop  As we can see from the source code, we are using @extends which will extend the  default layout from the layouts directory. We have the section content defined,  which will yield an extended default layout. Our Home page content section has   a slider code. Now all that is left is adding route to the Home page. So let's do that.  The following code in routes.php will do that:  Route::get ' ', function   {   return View::make 'home' ->with 'title', 'The Foldagram' -      >with 'page', 'home' ; } ;  [ 68 ]   So, we are using the Laravel's Blade Template engine to work out the layout template  for our site. Here is what we have done:  Templating with Laravel  The purpose here is to understand how the Laravel templating works. Also, we will  learn how to create a general layout template. Although we are not reviewing every  single detail in the code, but our goal is to create the Laravel template out of the code.  [ 69 ]   You might be wondering what about CSS JS? For consistent layout, we are using the  Twitter bootstrap  http:  twitter.github.io bootstrap  . It is a CSS framework  that you might already be familiar with. For the sliders part of the code, we are using  Flexslider  http:  flexslider.woothemes.com  . Once you include the Flexslider  JS CSS in your code, all you have to do is create a div container with an unordered  list. And each list item can contain your description and image, which we have seen  in app views home.blade.php.  The JavaScript code required to trigger the Flexslider is given as follows. It goes in  public js global.js.  $ window .load function   {   $ '.flexslider''' .flexslider {     animation: ""slide","     slideshow: false,   } ; } ;  Here is a stylesheet which is required for the Home page styles. It goes in   public css style.css.  body { font-size: 14px; color: 777; font-family: 'Museo''', Arial;  line-height: 20px; } p { margin-bottom: 15px } .da-slide p { color: black } a:hover { color: e65c08;

First,   let's set up a route for our About Us page:  Route::get ' about', function   {   return View::make 'about' ->with 'title','About       Foldagram' ->with 'page','about' ; } ;  [ 72 ]   Now, as per our route definition, we would need to create about.blade.php at   app views directory. So, here is our About Us page:  @extends 'layouts.default'   @section 'inner-banner'   "    "        About         We have a great story, and we'd' love to tell you about           it. By the way, did you watch the original Foldagram           video on the front page?         '"   @stop  @section 'content'   "    "        Where it all began...           Everyone knows the internet provides a wonderful tool           for quickly sharing thoughts and photos, but do you ever           miss real mail?  You know, the physical stuff that shows           up in your actual mailbox, something you can touch.           Postcards are nice, but they aren't' the same as opening           an envelope.  Besides, people seem to toss them out or           lose them because there's no easy way to stand them up!                  This is what led Jordan Bundy to create The Foldagram           in 2012. He was hiking in the Rocky Mountains near his           home in Vail, CO, and wanted to share the beauty of the           landscape. It seemed like a waste to just put photos on           Facebook, since they would get lost in the constant           shuffle of updates.  The idea of making prints, writing           messages, stuffing envelopes and going to the post office           just seemed daunting.  And yet, what other option was           there?           After several prototypes, The Foldagram was born.          Thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign, you can send          someone a unique piece of physical mail as easily as          updating a blog.

But, we have one  extra inner banner section in our About view, which is for the top banner we have in  the About Us page. Then the content section will contain the About Us page content  divided in two columns. This is how we can create any number of inner pages.  Creating the newsletter section Do you remember we have a newsletter section in our template? It's time to make the  newsletter section work. First of all we would need to create a subscribe table and a  migration file. So, let's generate a migration file via the artisan command:  php artisan migrate:make create_ subscribe_table --table=subscribe -– create  Also, add an e-mail column into the generated file. So, it will look like the   following code:  use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint; use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;  class CreateSubscribersTable extends Migration {   public function up     {  [ 74 ]           Schema::create 'subscribers', function Blueprint $table      {               $table->increments 'id' ;           $table->string 'email' ;           $table->timestamps  ;     } ;   }         public function down     {         Schema::drop 'subscribers' ;   } }  Let's run a migration to generate a table from migration file:  php artisan migrate  Now, as we have the database table ready for it, let's' explore how we can save  the user's e-mail when users subscribe to our site. We have formed a code in the  template for the newsletter section, which is given as follows:   "    "       {{ Form::open array 'url' => 'subscribe'  ; }}       {{ Form::label 'something', 'Sign Up for Our Newsletter           and Updates!' ; }}       {{ Form::text 'email', '', array 'class' => 'input-          large', 'placeholder' => ''  ; }}       {{ Form::submit 'Subscribe' ; }}       {{ Form::close  ; }}              Here, Form::open will generate the   tag with the post method and the  correct post URL where the form will be posted. So, we need to have a route   which responds to subscribe the POST request. So, let's define that:  Route::post ' subscribe', function   {   $input = Input::all  ;   $rules = array 'email'=>'requiredemail' ;        $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;   if  $validation->passes      {         Subscribe::create $input ;  [ 75 ]         return Redirect::to 'home' ->with 'success', 'Thanks' for           signing Up Foldagram.' ;   }      return Redirect::to 'home'        ->withInput         ->withErrors $validation        ->with 'message', 'There were validation errors.' ;    } ;  Here, our route file will receive the POST request for the subscribe route.   First, we will check with the validation object that the e-mail field is not empty  and the e-mail format is valid. If validations are passed, then we will store e-mail to  the subscribe table via the Subscribe Eloquent object. So, let's create an Eloquent  model for our subscribe table.  Eloquent is Laravel's  ORM Package  Object Relational Mapper  Package. It maps the database tables to the classes and database  table columns as the class attributes, which allows us to do very  useful things to the model such as saving, editing, and deleting.  Our model will reside at app\models\Subscribe.php:  class Subscribers extends Eloquent {   protected $fillable = array 'email' ; }  Here, we are defining a fillable array which is used by Eloquent to determine   which fields need to be allowed to change via the Subscribe model. Eloquent will  make sure when you are using Subscribe::create $input ; even if the $Input  array has other fields, it will not be saved in the database. Only the e-mail field will  be saved as we have declared it in the fillable array.  Now if validation fails, we are redirecting the user with Redirect::route 'home' .  It will redirect user with input and errors contained in the validation object. We need  to print these errors somewhere in our template; so let's add a message container in  our default template at  app views layout default.blade.php.  @if  $errors->any                  {{ implode '', $errors->all '' :"message<  li>''   }}       @endif  [ 76 ]   This will print any error messages received via the validation object. So that's all we  need to make the Newsletter section work. Users can fill e-mail from anywhere in the  site and it will be added to our newsletter table via the code we just wrote.  Creating a Foldagram form It's time to move on to creating our Foldagram form, but first let's check the designs  that we have got.  Foldagram form  [ 77 ]   Now when the user submits the form, we need to display the preview form that is  something as follows:  Foldagram preview  If you remember our user story, a user can create Foldagram from anywhere in  the site. So anytime a user presses the create Foldagram link in the top navigation,  we need to open the model box displayed in the preceding figure. Also, when the  user submits that form, we need to present the information from the Foldagram form  screenshot into the Foldagram preview screenshot, which is the main purpose of our  site. The Foldagram preview screenshot displays exactly how the Foldagram will look  and at which address it will be sent.  [ 78 ]   So first of all, we need to add a model box. This would need to be in every page as  the user can create a Foldagram from any page. In order to do this, we will create  a subview and then we will include that subview in our default template. So let's  create our subview at app views Foldagram.blade.php:  <div id=""popup"" class=""modal hide fade in"" tabindex="-"1""     role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""myModalLabel"" aria-    hidden=""false"" style=""display: block;">"    <button type=""button"" class=""close "" data-dismiss=""modal""        aria-hidden=""true">×      "        "       {{ asset 'img' create-form-flow.png'' ; }}          {{ Form::open  array 'url''' => URL::route 'create'''                  }}                      "                 "                   <textarea rows=""4"" class=""enter-message                       required"" placeholder=""Enter Your Message:                       *"" name=""message"" cols=""50">                     You have  "1200                        chars left.

We need  to add the JavaScript code to open it as a modal window. In order to do this, I have  added a jquery ui modal window script and the following script in global.js:    $ '.create-foldaram' .click function  {     $ 'createfoldagram' .modal {             keyboard: false     } ;   } ;  [ 80 ]   With the preceding code, we are hooking the click event with the create Foldagram  link in navigation. We are opening a model window and loading the content of our  pop up. So basically, we have set up our Foldagram code.  Summary In this chapter, we learned how we can set up a project in Laravel, how templating  system works, and how to utilize Laravel's structure to create a web application.  We started with migrations and created basic migrations for our Foldagram project.  We learned how to prepare schema and how we can seed the database.  Next, we learned how to set up layouts and Blade templating to manage dynamic  sections of our pages. Later, we created a newsletter and Foldagram form of our  Foldagram application.  In the next chapter, we will work on adding the Foldagram to the cart with the  option of previewing and then ordering it. We will create cart package first and  integrate this package in our Foldagram pop up.  [ 81 ]    Creating a Cart Package for  Our Application  In this chapter we will learn how Laravel handles packages. We will see the core  concepts of the Laravel framework to understand the relationship between the  packages and IoC container. We will also learn how to create packages.  Here is the list of things we will cover in this chapter.     The IoC container    Dependency Injection    Service providers    Packages in Laravel 4    Facades    Creating a Cart package    Preview Foldagram    Edit Foldagram    Delete Foldagram  One of the most appealing aspects of Laravel 4 is packages. It's the central idea  of Laravel 4 and hence it is built with lots of packages. All these packages are  completely separated from each other. In fact, some of the packages come from the  Symfony framework. So as a developer, you can develop the Eloquent package or a  log package if you wish to. If you think your changes can benefit the community, you  can send a pull request to your changes via GitHub. And if it's approved, anybody  can download it via the Composer Update command.   You can check Laravel packages by searching GitHub for packages  such as illuminate Auth or illuminate Log. You can fetch the Git  repository of these packages to see the actual source, or if you want  to work on them, you can work through these packages.  So how does Laravel work? How can it be so decentralized that its individual  packages can be updated, and how does it act as a framework? What's the thing that  binds all these packages? The simple answer to all these questions is IoC container.  Introducing IoC container IoC means Inversion of Control. You can define how a particular class or interface  can be resolved in the IoC container. The IoC container will use that information  whenever you need to resolve a class or interface throughout your application. Here,  the main benefit is that if you ever decide to rewrite the implementation of a class,  or you need to change the class with a new class, the IoC container will resolve the  class or interface to your implementation as long as your implementation follows the  original implementation's interface.  I know what most of you feel right now. It's very difficult to understand what the  IoC container, or even certain other terms, mean as we generally don't face these  terms in our day-to-day lives as PHP developers. So let's try to break down things  to a simpler level. Why do we need the IoC container? That brings us to one more  difficult question to be answered in order to achieve Dependency Injection.  Dependency Injection Dependency Injection is a software-design pattern which is used to remove hard  dependencies from code, and it allows us to change that dependency without  affecting the actual implementation.  Let's make it simpler with an example. We have our Car class defined as follows:  class Car {   function __construct     {     $this->_database = DB::getInstance  ;         OR infamous Global $DB way      Global $db;  [ 84 ]       $this->_database = $db;   }  Here, database is our hard dependency. We have bound the Car class with a  database object. Assume that you want to use the Car class in one of your other  projects and it uses a different database such as MongoDB or MSSQL. Apart from  this, you also have to create a singleton DB object to access your data, even when  your database implementation is different. Or that you need to have a global variable  $db set in such a way that the Car class can use it. So how can we remove this  dependency? Here is the answer:  class Car {   private $_database;    function __construct $dbconnection    {     $this->_database = $dbconnection;   }  }  }  So if you have observed carefully, we are now injecting our database dependency  via constructor. That's what we call Dependency Injection. Now it doesn't matter  how the implementation of the database class is used; all we need is a database  object passed at our constructor, and it will work on any type of project you develop  in future. As you may have the mongodb class or the mysql class as your database,  you can just pass this class via constructor. The Car class will use that as a database  object. You can instantiate your Car class as shown in the following code:  $car = new Car $databaseconnection ;  There is one more way we can set dependencies. Let's develop our Car class further  in the following manner:  class Car {   private $_database;   private $_engine;    function __construct  {    }    public function setDBConnection $dbconnection {  [ 85 ]       $this->_database = $dbconnection;   }    public function setEngine $engine {     $this->_engine = $engine;   }  }  As you can see, we are using setter methods to set our dependencies now.   To instantiate the Car class now, we would need the following code:  $car = new Car  ; $car->setDatabase $databaseConnection ; $car->setEngine $engine ;  This is how we can manage our dependencies. Now, imagine you have lots of  classes created, but as you create classes you will have more dependencies. Each  time you want to access the class, you will need to instantiate dependencies; this  is a cumbersome procedure. You will find that your code often becomes messy  and much harder to read due to dependencies. To solve this problem, you can use  containers. Containers are created for managing all the dependencies of a particular  class or  application.  class Container {     public static $_database;     public static function BuildCar $engine  {       $car = new Car  ;     $car->setDatabase self::$_database ; $car->setEngine $engine ;      return $car;   }   }  As you can see, all our dependencies are loaded when we call the static function  BuildCar within the Container class. We don't need to set it exclusively each time  we need to use our Car class.  [ 86 ]   As we are creating all our dependencies within our container, we can simply load  our car instance wherever we want by using the following line of code:  $car = Container::BuildCar  ;  That's how a container can be loaded. Remember our definition; containers are used  for a particular class or an interface to resolve instances application wide. Here, we  are using it for our Car class.  So, we have learned two important aspects of creating a Cart package: Dependency  Injection and IoC containers. Let's try to learn things in the context of Laravel. How  does Dependency Injection work in Laravel? How can you use it in your projects?  The IoC container in Laravel resolves classes or interfaces throughout Laravel.  You can look at the code of the IoC container at the root of your project,  vendor  laravel framework src Illuminate Container.php. You can use the bind  method of container to bind our classes so that we can use it throughout our   Laravel application.  Here is how you can resolve a class dependency in the IoC container, provided you  are auto-loading your class:  App::bind 'Car', function   {   $car = new Car  ;   $car->setDatabase $databaseConnection ;      return $car; }   So, whenever you load your Car class, all its dependencies will automatically be  loaded by the IoC container. This is one of the most useful things Laravel provides,  because in your typical web application, you will use a lot of classes or third-party  classes. When you want to write a wrapper around your third-party class, or you are  developing your own package, you can ensure that when your wrapper class loads,  all its dependencies are loaded automatically via the IoC container.  Now that we know what the IoC container and Dependency Injection are, it's time to  know where we can put this code. Well, you can put your IoC container bindings in  the two places listed below:  In your app start global.php        Service providers  [ 87 ]   You can place your container bindings directly in global.php file and Laravel will  pick up your binding when it bootstraps itself. This approach works for one or two  classes but when you have lot of classes or interfaces your global.php file will be  cluttered with lots of messy container bindings. A better way to handle container  bindings is service providers.  Service providers A service provider class in Laravel registers the IoC container bindings. It's the class  that will bind your package classes with the Laravel IoC container. Generally, this  can be done using two methods: register and boot. The register method will be  called by the Laravel framework of any service provider in the app.php config file,  at app config , during the bootstrap part of Laravel. So you can bind your classes  with Laravel's container.  Let's look at the sample service provider in the following code snippet:  use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;  class CarServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {    public function register     {     $this->app['Car'] = $this->app->share function $app      {        $car = new Car  ;       $car->setdb $dbconnection ;       return $car;     } ;   } }  Our ServiceProvider has to extend Laravel's ServiceProvider class, and for that  we will be using the Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider namespace to import  the ServiceProvider class and extending it via our CarserviceProvider class.  Each service provider will have at least a register method which allows us to hook  our class into the IoC container. In the preceding example, we define that whenever  the Car class is instantiated within our app, we need to resolve it by creating a new  instance of the Car class and setting its dependency.  [ 88 ]   Service providers are the way Laravel registers all its packages. In fact, you can   check app.php in your app config folder for the providers array. If you look   at the providers array, you will find following lines:  'providers' => array     'Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\ArtisanServiceProvider',   'Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider',   'Illuminate\Cache\CacheServiceProvider',   .......  ,  Remember, at the beginning of the chapter we were wondering how Laravel works  its magic? This is how Laravel's magic works:     Laravel has a lot of core components    When any request hits the Laravel framework, it bootstraps and loads its      Laravel's Application class extends the container class, so the container   Application class  class is also loaded     Framework loads and executes the register method of all the service   providers that are in the providers array at app config app.php     Each service provider by the Laravel packages has a registered method that   binds each of the package classes with the IoC container     Once each package is bound with the IoC container, you can use packages   such as Auth, Cache, and Log in your application  So, we have learned how the IoC container and service providers help Laravel work  together. Now let's move to packages and see if what we have learned helps us build  our first package.  Packages in Laravel 4 Packages are the easiest way you can add third-party code in Laravel. Also, you   can create your own packages to add new features to Laravel. You can find packages  from https:  packagist.org. There were more than 10,000 packages available,  at the time of writing this book, on the website. You will find packages such as the  date time manipulation package, the carbon or requests package, which will allow  you to easily consume APIs in your project.  [ 89 ]   Most of the packages that you will find at packagist.org are  standalone packages. These will work with all frameworks. But  there are Laravel-specific packages that specially utilize Laravel  structures such as Controller, route, Model, and migrations, which  will work only with the Laravel framework.  Let's see how we can create a new package via Laravel. To create a new package, we  can use the artisan command. But we will have to set a few configuration options  in app config workbench.php. In this file you need to set name and e-mail options.  If you have set up these values, then fire the following artisan command:  $ php artisan workbench Acme Cart –resources  The preceding command will generate a basic skeleton of your Laravel package in  the workbench directory. If you are wondering what Acme Cart is, acme could be  your company's name or your name and cart could be the package we are trying to  create. This is useful to avoid conflicts when more than one author is developing a  Cart package and one of them has the package name Acme as a vendor name .  The resources flag tells Laravel to generate a Laravel-specific package. Laravel will  add its structure directories, such as config, lang, migrations, and views.  Package structure Here is an image that displays the workbench package structure in Laravel 4:  [ 90 ]   Let's review the package structure. Laravel creates a directory structure based on the  vendor  package name  hierarchy. Here we have Acme Cart as our package name,  so Laravel has created the Acme directory inside the Cart directory. Here is a table  displaying the purpose of each file directory in the package:  src  acme  cart   cartserviceprovider.php  File Directory Public  Src  Src Config  Src Migrations  Src views  Tests  Vendor  Composer.json  Phpunit.xml  Purpose This manages package assets such as JS, CSS, and  images. It is useful because you will need to send  your assets while publishing your packages. This is the source directory of our package. Here, all  of our custom classes for packages will be stored.  Laravel automatically creates namespace directories  so that we can manage our source files in our  namespace. Laravel generates a service provider file for our  package with all the boilerplate code so that we don't  have to manually create the service provider code. This directory is used for creating package-specific  configurations. This directory is used for storing all of our package  migration. When somebody downloads your  package, they can add a package-specific table  schema from the migration files in this directory. This directory is used for creating package-specific  views.  This directory will hold all the unit tests you write for  your package. This directory will store all the dependent packages  that will be required to run our package. This file will have information specific to your  package, such as the package description and  package dependencies. This file is used to run unit tests for our package via  artisan.  So now that we know the structure of our package, let's move further to create  a basic test case, called hello world, for our package. When someone invokes our  package as shown:  Cart::message  ;  It should return the infamous Hello World message from the Cart package.  [ 91 ]   To do that we would need to first create our Cart class. So let's add our Cart class to  workbench acme cart src Acme Cart Cart.php. The following code shows the  creation of the Cart class:  namespace Acme\Cart;  class Cart {     function message     {     echo "hello world from cart package";   } }  If you see, we are not using the static method in the preceding code; then how can  we call it via Cart::message  ? Well, we have created our code, but as we have  learned, we will have to tie our code with the Laravel IoC container via service  provider. Let's create a CartServiceProvider.php file, in our Cart package at   src Acme Cart in the following manner:  namespace Acme\Cart;  use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;  class CartServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {     **    * Indicates if loading of the provider is deferred.    *    * @var bool    *    protected $defer = false;     **    * Bootstrap the application events.    *    * @return void    *    public function boot     {     $this->package 'acme cart' ;   }     **    * Register the service provider.  [ 92 ]      *    * @return void    *    public function register     {     $this->app['cart'] = $this->app->share function $app      {       return new Cart;     } ;   }     **    * Get the services provided by the provider.    *    * @return array    *    public function provides     {     return array 'cart' ;   }  }  The register method of our service provider will bind our Cart class with the  IoC container, and whenever we access the Cart class, it will resolve the register  method automatically. But you may be wondering about the two other methods:  boot and provides. Well, the boot method is used by Laravel to bootstrap the  package and load the views, configurations, and other resources. The provides  method is used to allow services of package to be used via the handle, provided in  the arrays. Generally, facades uses the handle provided by this method to access the  services of package. But we haven't learned what facades is. So let's take a look at it.  Facades A facade is a class that tapes into the Laravel IoC container and provides access to a  class object.  For each Facade class, we need to write a method getFacadeAccessor  , as the  Facade class of Laravel implements \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade.  [ 93 ]   Facades are the reason the Laravel syntax is super clean and yet works; a facade  provides static interfaces to classes that are available in the IoC container. So, when  you are writing the following code, you are actually calling the View alias, which  resolves by the View facade located at Illuminate\Support\Facades\View.php:  return View::make 'hello' ;  namespace Illuminate\Support\Facades;  class View extends Facade {     **    * Get the registered name of the component.    *    * @return string    *    protected static function getFacadeAccessor   { return 'view'; }  }  As you can see, we have to implement getFacadeAccessor, which returns our   view object from the IoC container. This allows us to use our View package as a static  interface, and we can call methods of our Illuminate\View\view.php class easily.  Whenever we do that, the IoC container loads dependencies automatically so our  syntax is clean and elegant.  Suppose you had to write a code to access the make method. We would have to  instantiate our dependencies first. The View class in Laravel depends on five classes:  EngineResolver, PhpEngine, BladeCompiler, FileViewFinder, and Environment.  Your code would have looked something like the following:  $view = new Illuminate\View\View  Environment $environment,  EngineInterface $engine, $view, $path, $data = array    ;  $view->make 'hello' ;  Imagine if you had to write the preceding code each time you want to load!   But you don't have to because of Laravel's magic; that's the power of the Laravel   IoC container, service provider, and facades. They all may seem to be complicated   at the first instance, but together they form a system that will help you maintain   your code in a way that you can write individual packages and yet it will have   easy-to-understand and elegant syntax.  [ 94 ]   To create a facade for your package, you will need to extend the Facade class  provided by the Laravel class. Now, let's create our Cart facade so that we can   access it just like the Laravel packages. This is done in the following manner:  namespace Acme\Cart\Facades;   use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade;   class Cart extends Facade {      **    * Get the registered name of the component.    *    * @return string    *    protected static function getFacadeAccessor   { return 'cart'; }   }  Now we need to add our alias to the alias array in app conf app.php so that we  don't have to write down the full namespace and can easily access our Cart class.  This is done in the following manner:  'aliases' => array    'Cart'        => 'Acme\Cart\Facades\Cart'  ;  Now that we have set up everything, let's write a route to test if it works in our  routes.php file:  Route::get ' cart', function   {   return Cart::message  ; } ;  If everything works out well, you will be greeted by hello world from   cart package.  We have learned how we can create a package and benefit from it. Now let's use our  newly gained knowledge to create a Cart class for our Foldagram web application.  [ 95 ]   Cart functions Let's plan out what we will be doing, so when we code, it will be easy for us.   Our Cart class will handle the following options:  Here, Foldagram is our main product. If you remember, in the last chapter we had  created a form that will ask for information about Foldagram.  For ease of use, we will create a Cart facade, which will allow us to use our Cart  package by simply calling our add method via the Cart alias.     Adding Foldagram to the cart    Updating the cart    Deleting from the cart    Viewing the cart contents    Viewing the cart total    Deleting all the items from the cart    $item = array        'id'      => 'foldagram_id',       'qty'     => 2,       'price'   => 25,       'name'    => 'Foldagram'    ;    Cart::insert $item ;  To handle the cart transactions temporarily, we will use Laravel's session class.  Session will hold the cart contents, as long as it is not ordered.  The Cart class Let's redefine our Cart class in Cart package to handle the session and initialize  necessary parts.  namespace Acme\Cart; use Illuminate\Session\Store as SessionStore; class Cart  [ 96 ]   {      private $session = null;    private $container = null;    private $cart_contents = null;    public function __construct SessionStore $session    {      $this->session = $session;      $this->container = 'Foldagram_Cart';          $this->initializecart  ;    } }  Here we are injecting the session class via its namespace to make sure we are not  setting a hard dependency on the session class. If somebody wants to replace the  session class with, say for example MongoDB, they can easily do that as they will  not have to change all of our classes. They can just inject their object, and our class  will use that implementation to serve Cart via the IoC container.  We are going to use the container variable for the purpose of wrapping our   cart items. Here is our initializecart method for initializing our cart with   default values:  public function initializecart   {   array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container, $this->session- >get $this->container  ;    if  is_null array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container,  null      {       array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container, array 'cart_ total' => 0, 'total_items' => 0  ;   }    }  [ 97 ]   Here, we are setting our cart_contents array from session. The array_set helper  helps us to wrap our cart options array with our container. Here, array_get and  array_set are array helpers provided by Laravel. If you are wondering what they  do, here is a very simple example of what they do:  $array = array 'gallery' => array 'title' => 'My image'  ; $value = array_get $array, 'gallery.title' ;    will output "My Image"  array_set $array, 'gallery.title', 'My Image changed' ;  $value = array_get $array, 'gallery.title' ;  will output "My Image  changed"  As shown, array_get   and array_set   can help you access deeply nested arrays  easily via the key-value pair chain.  Adding Foldagram to the cart Now that it's all set up, let's add a method to our Cart class for adding Foldagram   to it:  function insert $item = array      {      $this->validate $item ;              $item['qty'] =  float  $item['qty'];              $item['price'] =  float  $item['price'];      if  isset $item['id']       {       $rowid = md5 $item['id'] ;     }      $item['rowid'] = $rowid;     $item['qty']  +=  int  array_get $this->cart_contents, $this- >container . '.' . $rowid . '.qty', 0 ;      array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' . $rowid,  $item ;      $this->update_cart  ;      return $rowid;   }  [ 98 ]   Here we are setting initial items, such as quantity, price, and row ID, from array.  Row ID is generated by the md5 method for creating a unique row for our cart  contents, so later we can use this to update our record or delete it from our   container. After updating individual items, we are merging the $item array into   our container.  The first line has the validate method for validating items that go into the  container. Here is the code for that:  function validate $item {    if   ! is_array $item  or count $item  == 0    {     throw new Acme\Cart\CartInvalidDataException;   }    $required_indexes = array 'id', 'qty', 'price', 'name' ;    foreach  $required_indexes as $index    {     if   ! isset $item[ $index ]       {       throw new Acme\Cart\CartRequiredIndexException  'Required index [' . $index . '] is missing.' ;     }   }       if   ! is_numeric $item['qty']  or $item['qty'] == 0    {     throw new Acme\Cart\CartInvalidItemQuantityException;   }    if   ! is_numeric $item['price']     {     throw new Acme\Cart\CartInvalidItemPriceException;   }  }  [ 99 ]   In our validate method, we first check if the array is empty; if it's empty, we will  throw an exception. Next, we check if all our indexes are present in our item array.  And lastly, we check qty and price for the numeric values.  Now, if you have noticed, we have the update_cart method in our insert method.  It's the method that will update our cart total and put our data into the session. Let's  define it in the following manner:  function update_cart   {    array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.total_items',  0 ;   array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.cart_total',  0 ;    foreach  array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container  as $rowid  => $item    {      if   ! is_array $item  or ! isset $item['price']  or !  isset $item['qty']       {       continue;     }          $this->cart_contents[ $this->container ]['cart_total'] +=   $item['price'] * $item['qty'] ;     $this->cart_contents[ $this->container ]['total_items'] +=  $item['qty'];      $subtotal =  array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container .  '.' . $rowid . '.price'  * array_get $this->cart_contents, $this- >container . '.' . $rowid . '.qty'  ;      array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' . $rowid .  '.subtotal', $subtotal ;   }    $this->session->put $this->container, array_get $this->cart_ contents, $this->container  ;   return true; }  [ 100 ]   In ther preceding code, we will initially merge our total items and cart total with our  container. Then we will loop through each item and update our cart total and total  items in the cart. And finally we will use the session library's put method to put our  data into the session, so our data is preserved between requests.  So the exact process we are using is as follows:  1.  First we create a container that holds the cart via the class constructor. 2.  We inject the session via the constructor so it can be utilized at any place in   the class.  3.  Next, we check if session has the cart array, and if it does, we wrap it with   our container via array_get.  4.  For adding the item to our cart, we use the item array. For each item, we add   a unique row so we can manage when we want to edit or delete items.  5.  Then, we update the cart totals and the number of the cart items so that we   can display them immediately. And finally, we save it in a session.  As we have gone through the process of adding Foldagram to our cart, let's move to  the part where we update it.  Updating the cart If someone changes our Foldagram quantity, we need to update our cart to make  sure our price is updated. We also need to track if somebody updates the quantity  as 0; this means we need to remove that Foldagram from our cart. So here is our  updated method for working on that:  function update $item = array    {    $rowid = array_get $item, 'rowid', null ;    if  is_null $rowid     {     throw new CartInvalidItemRowIdException;   }    if  is_null array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' .  $rowid, null      {     throw new CartItemNotFoundException;  [ 101 ]     }    $qty =  float  array_get $item, 'qty' ;    array_forget $item, 'rowid' ;   array_forget $item, 'qty' ;    if   ! is_numeric $qty     {     throw new CartInvalidItemQuantityException;   }    if   ! empty $item     {     foreach  $item as $key => $val      {       array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' . $rowid  . '.' . $key, $val ;     }   }    if  array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' . $rowid  . '.qty'  == $qty    {     return true;   }    if  $qty <= 0    {     array_forget $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' .  $rowid ;   }    else   {     array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container . '.' . $rowid .  '.qty', $qty ;   }         $this->update_cart  ;    return true; }  [ 102 ]   Here, we first fetch rowid from the array so that we can get a handle for our item  array. If it isn't there, a request could be forged, as we are creating that parameter  via our insert method. Next, we check via array_get if rowid is in our container  array. If it's not, that means the cart item is not in our cart, so we must generate an  exception with CartItemNotFoundException.  Now we check if our newly provided item array is empty or not. If it's not   empty, we can safely update each of our Cart class items from the item array   via array_set. Then we check if our quantity is 0; if it is, we need to remove it   from our Cart class. If everything is in the right order, our update_cart   method  will be called and will hold our Cart class container array into the session; this is  how we can update our cart items.  Deleting from cart To delete an item from cart, all we need is the rowid of that item. Once we have the  rowid  remember, we have already written the code in our update method , if the  cart item has 0 as a quantity, it should be removed from the cart. So here is the code  for deleting a cart item:  public function remove $rowid = null  {      if  is_null $rowid     {     throw new CartInvalidItemRowIdException;   }    if  $this->update array 'rowid' => $rowid, 'qty' => 0      {     return true;   }  }  As you can see in the preceding code, if rowid is passed, we just need to call our  update method with the item array as rowid and the quantity as 0. Our update  method will handle this and remove it from our cart, as well as update the session   as it already has a mechanism for that.  [ 103 ]   Viewing the cart contents We have created methods for adding, editing, and deleting items from cart. Now,  let's create a method that will allow us to get the cart data as an array. This is done   in the following manner:  public function contents   {   $cart = array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container ;    array_forget $cart, 'total_items' ;   array_forget $cart, 'cart_total' ;    return $cart; }  In order to display our cart array, we first fetch it from our container via the   array_get Laravel helper function. Next, we remove items such as total_items  and cart_total just so that we can easily loop over our cart array.  Viewing the cart total Next, we need to get the total of our cart, which includes each item's price and  quantity. However, we are already managing it in our cart container array as we are  updating the total when we insert or update any item from the cart. So, to load the  cart total, all we have to do is execute the following code:    public function total     {     return array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container .   '.cart_total', 0 ;    }  Deleting all items from the cart Up next, how do we remove all items from cart or how can we destroy our cart?  First, we override our container array with empty values and then remove it from  our current session, as shown in the following code snippet:  public function destroy   {      array_set $this->cart_contents, $this->container, array 'cart_total'  => 0, 'total_items' => 0  ;    $this->session->forget $this->container ; }  [ 104 ]   Here, we set our cart with an empty container and then, via Laravel's session class'  forget   method, we remove it from our actual session.  We may need one more method to identify how many items are in cart for  displaying it in our navigation. So here is the method that will display the   count of cart items in our pages:  public function total_items   {   return array_get $this->cart_contents, $this->container .   '.total_items', 0 ;  }  As we already have the total_items key, which updates the total items in the cart  when an item is added, edited, or deleted; we don't need to count it, we can grab it  from our cart array.  So, this is the basic functionality we needed for our Cart package to work. But we  need to rewrite our service provider, as we are passing a dependency of our session.  We need to pass it via service provider's register method. So here is our new  service provider for the Cart class:  namespace Acme\Cart;  use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;  class Cart extends ServiceProvider {    protected $defer = false;    public function boot     {     $this->package 'acme cart' ;    }       public function register     {             $this->app['Cart'] = $this->app->share function $app  {              return new Cart $this->app['session'] ;          } ;    }    public function provides    [ 105 ]     {     return array 'Cart' ;   }  }  If you've noticed, in the register method, we resolve our session array by  injecting it into the Cart class via $this->app['session']. So Laravel will   make sure that whenever a new instance of Cart class is created, an instance   of the session class will be injected into our Cart class. We have already created  facades of our Cart class and a reference of it in app config app.php, so it will   be automatically loaded by Laravel whenever the page requests the Cart class.  Integrating the Cart package in Foldagram  order process In Chapter 4, Building a Real-life Application with Laravel – The Foldagram, we have  created Foldagram Lightbox, which allows a user to create Foldagram. Now,   it's time to integrate features, such as adding Foldagram to database and   preview Foldagram, as well as to add into the cart to manage orders.     Adding the Foldagram information to the Foldagram table    Adding the recipient information to the recipient's table    Adding the Foldagram order details to the cart    Editing the Foldagram information    Editing the recipient information    Deleting Foldagram from the cart    Creating the preview page to preview the order  Adding the Foldagram information to the   Foldagram table So let's start by adding the Foldagram information to the Foldagram table. We need  to set up two things here: first, we need to save the message to the Foldagram table;  then, we need to process the Foldagram image provided by the user and resize it so  that we can use it when we want to preview it. But we would also need to set up two  tables: Foldagram and Foldagram_Recipients.  [ 106 ]   Here is the migration command for adding a Foldagram schema in our   database migrations:  $ php artisan migrate:make create_foldagram_table  This will generate a schema file at app database migrations. Here is the schema  we need to add to our Foldagram table schema:  Schema::create 'foldagram', function Blueprint $table  {   $table->increments 'id' ;   $table->text "message" ;   $table->string "image",255 ;   $table->boolean 'status', array '0', '1'  ->default 0 ;   $table->integer 'user_id' ;   $table->timestamps  ;  Similarly, here is schema for the recipient's table:  Schema::create 'foldagram_reff_address', function Blueprint  $table  {   $table->increments 'id' ;   $table->integer 'foldaram_id' ;   $table->string "fullname",255 ;   $table->string "country",255 ;   $table->string "address_one",255 ;   $table->string "address_two",255 ;   $table->string "city",255 ;   $table->string "state",255 ;   $table->string "zipcode",255 ;   $table->timestamps  ;  } ;  } ;  Next, we need to migrate the tables into the database via the following command:  $ php artian migrate  To access these tables, we need to create models. So let's create two models at   app models Foldagram.php and app models Receipients.php:  class Foldagram extends Eloquent {    public function recipients    [ 107 ]   The following is our recipient's Model, which is similar to our Foldagram Model:    {     return $this->hasmany 'recipients' ;   } }  class Recipients extends Eloquent{      public static $table = 'recipients';          public function foldagram       {          return $this->belongsTo 'Foldagram' ;     }  If you noticed, we have defined an Eloquent Model relationship between the two  tables. We have defined our Foldagram Model to have a one-to-many relationship  with the recipient's Model. This is going to help us when we want to query related  data from both the tables. Now, we have set up the basic requirements and can query  the database or add update delete the database via our models.  Let's add a post route to submit Foldagram Lightbox to the Foldagram's   create Controller:  Route::post 'create', 'foldagram@create' ;  Now, let's add the code to save the message and generate Foldagram_id in the  following manner:  function create  {    $foldagram = new Foldagram;    $foldagram->message = Input::get 'message' ;    $foldagram->save  ;  }  }  [ 108 ]   Image resizing in Laravel We also need to save the Foldagram image and resize it for previewing it in  thumbnails. For resizing the images, we will use an external package called  Intervention image. To use the intervention package, we need to install it   via Composer. Open your composer.json file and add the following line:  "intervention image": "dev-master"  And run following Composer command:  $ Composer install  This will install our package in the vendor directory. Also, we need to add   the service provider of the class so we can bind it to our Laravel setup in   app\config\app.php in the service provider array.  'Intervention\Image\ImageServiceProvider'  Also we need to add the facade, so we can easily access it via an alias in our   alias array:  'Image' => 'Intervention\Image\Facades\Image'  Now, we will have access to our intervention library via the image alias autoloaded  by Laravel. To store an image, we will create the uploads directory in our public  img directory. Also, for storing thumbnails, we will create a thumbnails directory in  our public img directory. Here is the code, which we will add code to our create  method of the Foldagram Controller, to save the image first and then resize it.  $filename = $foldagram->id."_".str_random 8 . '.' . File::extension In put::file 'image.name'  ;  $destinationPath = 'img uploads '; $thumnailPath = 'img thumbnails '.$filename;  Input::file 'image' ->move $destinationPath, $fileName ;  Image::make Input::file 'image' ->getRealPath   ->resize 100,  100 ->save $thumnailPath ;  $foldagram->image = $filename; $foldagram->save  ;  [ 109 ]   In the preceding code, we first create a unique image path so that the image upload  doesn't conflict even if another image has the same name. Our Model is $foldagram  and $foldagram->id is our newly inserted ID. We then move the image via the  Input::move method. We use our Image package to resize the image to 100 x 100.  In the end, we use our Foldagram Eloquent Model to save the generated filename to  our database.  Adding the recipient information to the Recipients  table Now, let's add the recipient information to the Recipients table. A user can add as  many recipients as they want, so we need to loop over all the recipient text inputs  and save them to the database. Let's add the following code to our create method:  $recipients_input = Input::get 'address' ;  if !empty $recipients_input  {    $recipients = array  ;    foreach $recipients_input as $value {          $recipients[] = array        'fullname'=>$value['fullname'],       'address_one'=>$value['address_one'],      ;        }    $foldagram->recipients  ->save $recipients ; }  Here, we loop through all the inputs named address and then add it to our recipients  table via our Foldagram Model. Laravel will automatically add a Foldagram ID, as  we are using the Foldagram Model and have the relationship defined in our models.  [ 110 ]   Adding the Foldagram order details to our Cart  package Now it's time to add our order details into our Cart package. We need to  gather all our inputs and create an array so that we can pass it into our  Cart::insert $array  method. Let's add the following code to our   Foldagram Controller's create method:  try{    $qty = count Input::get 'add'  ;    $item = array      'id'      => $foldagram->id,     'qty'     => $qty,     'price'   => Config::get 'foldagram.price' ,     'name'    => 'Foldagram'    ;       Add the item to the shopping cart.   Cart::insert $item ;       Redirect to the cart page.   return Redirect::route 'home'    ->with 'success',"Your Foldagram Has Saved"    ->with 'redirect',"preview" ;    } catch Exception $e  {        return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', $e->getMessage    ; }  catch  Cart\CartInvalidDataException $e  {   return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', 'Invalid data  passed.' ; }  catch  Cart\CartInvalidItemQuantityException $e  {  [ 111 ]     return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', 'Invalid item  quantity.' ; }  catch  Cart\CartInvalidItemRowIdException $e  {   return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', 'Invalid item row  id.' ; }  catch  Cart\CartInvalidItemNameException $e  {   return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', 'Invalid item name.' ; }  catch  Cart\CartInvalidItemPriceException $e  {   return Redirect::route 'home' ->with 'error', 'Invalid item  price.' ; }  If you notice, we are taking the Foldagram price from the config file   app config Foldagram.php, which will have the following code:  Return array 'price' => 5   Here, USD 5 is the price per Foldagram. We load it with Laravel's Config::get  method. Next, we build our array for adding it to our Cart package. As we have  already loaded the Cart package via service provider and given an alias via facade,  we can directly use the Cart::insert method to temporarily store our cart  into  session via the Cart package. Isn't it sweet?   If you noticed, there are lots of exceptions. These exceptions come from our Cart  class. We were throwing these exceptions in the insert method of our Cart class  section. And we are catching these package exceptions here and displaying the  appropriate errors.  If everything goes right, we will send the user to the home page with a preview  parameter, which will trigger the preview process, as users can get instant feedback  on how things will look. At the end of the chapter, we will learn in detail about how  the preview will work. Right now, let's see how we can edit our Foldagram or edit  the recipient information.  [ 112 ]   Creating the preview page to preview Foldagram As soon as we add Foldagram, we are redirecting users to our preview Lightbox in  the add Foldagram section. Here is the design of our preview Foldagram section:  Now, as per the preview design page, we need to build a Lightbox pop up. It will  hold the preview information and the recipient information that we fetch from the  database. As you can see, we need to give the user control to edit the Foldagram  recipient addresses, the message, and the picture information in the design. So, let's  first construct our Foldagram preview Lightbox.  We need to add our code into our app\views\layouts.blade.php, as we want to  allow the preview page Lightbox pop up to open on any page of our site. We will use  our jQuery modal component that we used for creating the Foldagram Lightbox. But  for the purpose of readability, we will create our view file at app\views\foldagram_ preview.blade.php and just include this file by using the following code:  @include 'foldagram_preview' ;  [ 113 ]   Here is our JavaScript code which will display the modal window. The modal  function is called via the jQuery UI library:  $ document .ready function   {   $ 'preview' .modal 'show' ; } ;  And finally, to preview the image, here is the Lightbox code that will generate the  Model container with data, which will be stored in the Foldagram_preview.blade. php file.  <?php   $foldagram_data = Foldagram::find $id ; ?>                    <img src="{{ <img src="{{ URL::to 'public'  }} img create-form- flow.png" > }}">               {{ $foldagram_data->message }}                      {{ HTML::image 'img uploads '.$foldagram_data->path, "Foldagram  Image"  }}                                                   <button class="edit-btn btn-large btn-large btn"  type="button">Edit                      <button class="approve-btn btn-large btn-large btn"  type="button">Approve                                    In the preceding code, we first find Foldagram via our Eloquent Model Foldagram.  Then, we displayed it in our preview container, which is opened via the jQuery  UI Modal box. We show the message, as well as uploaded image, via our Eloquent  objects $foldagram_data->message and $foldagram_data->path.  [ 114 ]   Now, we also need to preview the recipient addresses attached with Foldagram. To  do so, we need to find the addresses from the database. Eloquent is here to help; we  can find these addresses with just one line of Eloquent, which is as follows:  $Receipients = Foldagram::find 1 ->Receipients;   Now, we need to loop them and display them in our model box. Here is the code   for that:      @foreach $Recipients as $value     id }}">             Recipient  {{ $i++ }}       The Foldagram      PO, Box 1330      Avon, CO 81620                              {{ $value->fullname}}           <?php $text = preg_replace " [\r\n]+ ", "\n", $value- >address ;         $text = wordwrap $text,120, ' ', true ;         echo $text = nl2br $text ; ?>                               id.' '.$rowid  }}"  class="removeadd btn btn-danger">Remove        @endforeach    In the preceding code, we loop through each recipient and display their address   as a box in our Model window. We extract the recipient's name and address via  $value->fullname and $value->address. We process the address value, as we  want it to be more than 120 characters, otherwise it will fall off from the box; we are  converting line breaks from textarea to HTML line breaks via the nl2br function.  [ 115 ]   Deleting the recipient's information In the Foldagram preview, we provide the option to delete recipients from  Foldagram. In our Foldagram Controller let's add the removeReceipient   method for that with the following code:  function removeRecipient $id  {   $Receipient = Receipient->find $id ;   $Receipient->delete  ;   return Redirect::route 'preview' ; }  Now, we just need to add a route for this in our routes.php file.  Route::get 'remove  :any ', array 'as' => 'removereceipient', 'uses'  => 'foldagram@removeReceipient  ;  Editing the Foldagram information First, let's add a route for edit in our routes.php file:  Route::post 'edit', 'foldagram@edit' ;  Let's add code to save the edited information in our Foldagram Controller:  public function edit   {     $foldagram_id = Input::get 'foldagram_id' ;   $foldagram = Foldagram::find $foldagram_id ;    if Auth::check   {     $user_id = Auth::user  ->id;        }   else {     $user_id = 0;   }    $foldagram->message = Input::get 'message' ;   $foldagram->user_id = $user_id;   $foldagram->save  ;  }  [ 116 ]   Here, we will get the Foldagram ID from the request, and we are using it to fetch the  data from the Foldagram model's find method. We also check if the user is logged  in. If the user is logged in, we save his ID into the Foldagram table so we can always  display this item in the user's cart. We also save the message, just in case it's edited  by the user via the Foldagram Model's save method.  Deleting Foldagram from the cart We need to allow the user to remove Foldagram from cart. Let's add a code for that  in our Foldagram Controller:  function remove $item_id = null, $id=null  {   try   {     if !empty $id  {       Cart::remove $item_id ;     }else {       return Redirect::to 'cart' ->with 'error', 'Invalid foldagram  ID!' ;     }      }    catch  Cart\CartInvalidItemRowIdException $e    {     return Redirect::to 'cart' ->with 'error', 'Invalid Item Row  ID!' ;   }    catch  Cart\CartItemNotFoundException $e    {     return Redirect::to 'cart' ->with 'error', 'Item was not found in  your shopping cart!' ;   }    catch  Cart\CartException $e    {     return Redirect::to 'cart' ->with 'error', 'An unexpected error  occurred!' ;   }      return Redirect::to 'cart' ->with 'success', 'The item was removed  from the shopping cart.' ; }  [ 117 ]   Here, we first check if the ID is present; if it is, we remove the cart item from our  Cart package via the remove method. We check for various exceptions, such  as, whether the item is in the shopping cart or if the item's row ID is present. If  everything goes right, we send the user a success message on our cart page.  Summary In this chapter we have learned how Laravel packages work and how to make one  that will work for you. We also learned how to integrate our standalone package in  our complex Foldagram project and do things the Laravel way.  In the process, we learned about Dependency Injection and how IoC containers can  manage dependencies for you. We also learned how service providers integrate your  package with IoC containers and we used all these concepts to build our Cart package.  In the next chapter we will learn about the user's dashboard.  [ 118 ]   User Management and  Payment Gateway Integration  In this chapter, we will create our user registration, login, and dashboard pages. We  will learn how we can authenticate users. Later, we will learn integrating our cart with  payment gateway. By doing this, we will also learn how we can utilize the existing  Laravel packages, as well as how to find them and integrate them in our projects.  So after completing cart pages, I have to meet Jordan to show him the progress and  planning the user section of the web application. After getting a lot of exciting demo  time, Jordan was told now it's time to move to the user section of the site.  After our user section's discussion, we decided that the following list is essential to  the user section:     User should be able to register    User should be able to log in    User dashboard should be provided where a user can see all his    account options     User should be able to change the password    User should be able to manage his profile  We worked through and finalized the user section wireframes so the designer can  give us the design on time and I can utilize those designs when I create pages. We  also discussed how the workflow of cart pages and checkout page works as well as  our payment gateway. Jordan was thinking of using PayPal but we decided finally  on Stripe as we both agreed it's the simplest and best way to integrate credit cards   on our application.   So now we need to create the user section with the following pages:     User registration    User login    User dashboard    User password change    Manage profile  We will create a layout for the user section as all the user features would have same  look and feeling. We will store all the user section views in a separate user folder and  create a special layout file for the section; so in future if we need to apply changes to  the section, we can easily apply it via user layout.  Introducing the Sentry package But how do we authenticate users? Well Laravel 4 does come with built-in  authentication mechanism, but it doesn't include the ability to handle user   groups and permissions. So, do we build the authentication system?  The answer is No! Because as we have discussed previously, Laravel is a   psr-0 ready framework and it can utilize thousands of packages available at  https:  packagist.org . One of the consistently managed authentication   library for Laravel 4 is Sentry 2. It's very flexible and provides a great way to  authenticate the users.  So let's quickly install Sentry 2 into our project. The first step to install Sentry is  to add its entry to the composer.json file. In our composer.json file's require  attribute, we will add the following code:  "require": {     "laravel framework": "4.0.*",     "cartalyst sentry": "2.0.*"   }  Run composer update to install the Sentry package into our project. Next we need  to add Sentryserviceprovider into our application's service providers' list so that  Laravel can tap into the Sentry object whenever we need authentication. So add the  following code into app config app.php in the service provider array:  Cartalyst\Sentry\SentryServiceProvider  [ 120 ]   The last step is optional but allows us to write Sentry without specifying namespace,  so we will add the Sentry alias into our app config app.php as follows:  'Sentry' => 'Cartalyst\Sentry\Facades\Laravel\Sentry'  Also don't forget to install the schema from Sentry. To add all the database schemas  from Sentry, we will run migrations via the following command:  php artisan migrate --package=cartalyst sentry  You should always use the artisan command, php artisan  config:publish vendor package, for creating a copy of the  configuration files of the package in your config directory. As and when  you update your package, your vendor directory changes will be lost.  With Sentry, authenticating the users is a breeze! All you have to do is use Sentry's  authenticate method to check if the user's credentials are true. Here is a sample  code which will do that:    $credentials = array          'email'    => 'test@example.com',         'password' => 'test',      ;        Try to authenticate the user     $user = Sentry::authenticate $credentials, false ;  If $user { echo "You are logged in!"; }  As we have loaded Sentry via its service provider, we can access the Sentry package  methods directly. To authenticate the user, we need to provide an array with an  e-mail and a password.  Setting up our user section To set up our user section, we will create user layout and the following files in the  views directory:      view layouts user.blade.php: Main user layout file     view user register.blade.php: Registration page     view user login.blade.php: Login page     view user changePassword.blade.php: Change password page     view user dashboard.blade.php: Dashboard page  [ 121 ]   Here all the pages will extend the user.blade.php file. Let's create our   user.blade.php file.                   {{ $title }}        <link href='  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Droid+Sans:400,700'  rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>      {{ HTML::style 'css bootstrap.css'  }}   {{ HTML::style 'css style.css'  }}   {{ HTML::style 'css user.css'  }}                              @if Sentry::check             {{ link_to_route 'myaccount', 'My  Account'  }}  Welcome !       @endif          @yield 'inner-banner'              @yield 'content'                                           {{ link_to_route 'contact', 'Contact'  }}             {{ link_to_route 'about', 'About Us'  }}             {{ link_to_route 'login', 'Log In'  }}              {{ link_to_route 'register', 'Register'  }}                              [ 122 ]              Foldagram is patent pending             &copy;Copyright All Encompassing Productions llc, 2012<  p>                              Here we are including the user.css file for the user section and in the header we are  including a link to my account only if the user is logged in. We are checking it via the  Sentry::check   method; it will ensure that the user is logged in so the link will be  only displayed to the logged in users. Then we are including a banner and the main  containers which can be filled by our custom pages.  Register user Now as we have a skeleton for the user section ready, let's create our registration  screen. We would need to create a route and controller method for that. Here is our  route method for registration:  Route::get 'register', array 'as' => 'postregister', 'uses' => 'pages@ register'  ; Route::get 'myaccount', array 'as' => 'myaccount', 'uses' => 'pages@ myaccount'  ;  Now we need to create the register method that will load the registration view.  Here is code for that:  function register   {   if Sentry::check   {     return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ;   }   return View::make "user.register" ->with "title","The Foldagram -  Register"    ->with "page_title","Register" ->with 'class','register' ; }  We are checking if the user is already logged in; if yes, then instead of showing the  user registration page, we are redirecting the user to my account page. If the user  is not logged in, then we are loading our registration blade page file from the user  directory in the views folder.  [ 123 ]   To construct the view file, we would need to know its layout and structure. Here is  the layout of our registration page:  User registration layout  Based on our registration layout, let's code view user registration.blade.php.  First let's add the inner-banner section as follows:  @extends 'layouts.user'   @section 'inner-banner'                   {{ $page_title}}         So glad you're here.  I'm sure you know what to do.                  @stop  Here we are extending our user layout and displaying the banner section. We are  printing the title of the page that we send using the Controller.  [ 124 ]   Now let's add our main registration form section via the content section:  @section 'content'          {{ Form::open  array 'url'=>'register'    }}                  First Name :<  label>                     <input type="text" name="first_name" class="input-xxlarge"  id="first_name" value="{{ Input::old 'first_name'  }}" placeholder="">                                    Last Name :<  label>                     <input type="text" name="last_name" class="input-xxlarge"  id="last_name" value="{{ Input::old 'last_name'  }}" placeholder="">                                               Email * :                      <input type="text" name="email" class="input-xxlarge"   id="email" value="{{ Input::old 'email'  }}" placeholder="">                                              Password * :<  label>                     <input type="password" name="password" class="input-xxlarge"  id="password" value="{{ Input::old 'password'  }}" placeholder="">                                              Confirm Password *  :             [ 125 ]             <input type="password" name="password_confirmation"  class="input-xxlarge" id="password_confirmation" value="{{  Input::old 'password_confirmation'  }}" placeholder="">                                            Register    {{ Form::close   }}          @stop  Here we have created a form via a Form helper which will be posted at the Register  link. The div.control group containers are Twitter bootstrap classes to visually  display the form just like the layout in the User registration layout screenshot. We are  also using the Input::old method to retrieve the field values if in case the form is  posted back via validation errors.  Now the form will be posted to the post_register method of the pages Controller  via route, as shown in the following line of code:  Route::post 'register', array 'as' => 'postregister', 'uses' =>  'pages@register'  ;  We need to ensure the following points when the user is registered:     Validate the user data    Save the user into our users table via Sentry    Send the welcome e-mail to the user  So let's first validate the user data, as follows:      $rules = array          'email' => 'requiredemailunique:users',         'password' => 'requiredconfirmed',         'password_confirmation' => 'required'      ;      $input = Input::get  ;     $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;      if  $validation->fails    {         return Redirect::to 'register' ->with_input  ->with_ errors $validation ;     }  [ 126 ]   We are using Laravel's Validation class to validate the user data. The $rules   array will ensure the following: e-mail is not empty, it's a valid e-mail format, and  it's already not in our database. The validator will return true or false on its fails  method. If it fails, we are redirecting the user with the Redirect response with errors  and input.  Next is to save the user into our database with Sentry. Here is code for that:         $user = Sentry::createUser array          'email'    => Input::get 'email' ,         'password' => Input::get 'password' ,         'metadata' => array              'first_name' => Input::get 'first_name' ,         'last_name'  => Input::get 'last_name' ,                      ;  Sentry has a createUser method that allows us to send the array which will be  saved into our database. Sentry will take care of the password field automatically.   It will generate a hash for us.  Now we need to send the welcome e-mail to the user. We will use the Laravel's   built-in Mail class to send e-mail. Here is the code for that:  Mail::send 'emails.welcome', $data, function $message  {   $message->to Input::get 'email'  ->subject 'Welcome to the  Foldagram!' ; } ;  Here we are using the Mail class to send an e-mail to the user. The first argument  emails.welcome is the e-mail template file stored at views emails welcome. blade.php. Here is code for that:   We have received your information and your account has been set  up.    You can log in at "{{ link_to_route 'userlogin', 'Login'   }} " Ready to get started?  Purchase credits at "{{ link_to_ route 'pcredit', 'Purchase Credits'  }}     If you have any questions, please contact us at info@thefoldagram. com.  We're happy to have you!   [ 127 ]   User login As we have set up user registration, it's time now to set up user login. We need   to allow the user to log in via our login page. So here's the route to register our   login page:  Route::controller 'pages' ;  Next is to write a Controller method that will display our login page. Here is the  code for that:  public function getLogin   {   if Sentry::check   {     return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ;   }    return View::make "pages.login" ->with "title","The Foldagram -  Login"    ->with "page_title","Login" ->with 'class','login' ; }  Here once again we are checking if the user is logged in; if yes, then instead of  displaying the login page, we are redirecting the user to my accounts page.  Here is our login.blade.php layout:  User Login Layout  [ 128 ]   Here's the code for our login.blade.php page:  @extends "layouts.user"   @section 'content'    {{ Form::open  array 'url'=>'login'   }}                                                Email          <input type="text" name="username" tabindex="1" value="{{  Input::old 'username' }}" placeholder="">          Password          <input type="password" name="password" tabindex="2"  placeholder="">                     <input type="submit" class="btn btn-large btn-inverse"  value="Login" tabindex="3">           @stop  Here we are extending our user layout via the extends blade method. Also creating  the form that will be posted at the Login link. Let's create a method which will  receive this form and will allow the users to log in to the site.  In our pages Controller, let's add the post_login method that will first validate and  then allow the user to log in to site.  function postLogin   {   $rules = array        'email'  => 'requiredemail',       'password' => 'required',    ;   $input = Input::get  ;   $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;    if  $validation->fails      {       return Redirect::to_route 'userlogin' ->with_errors $validation- >errors ->with_input  ;   } }  [ 129 ]   Here we are checking if the e-mail and the password is supplied and also whether  the e-mail format is correct using Laravel's inbuilt Validator class. If it's not correct,  we are sending the user back to the login page.  Let's check if the user's credentials are right using the following code:  $credentials = array  'email'=> Input::get 'email' , 'password'=>  Input::get 'password'   ;  if  Sentry::authenticate $credentials, false   {          return Redirect::to 'myaccount'  } else {     return Redirect::to 'login' ->with "error", "There is problem with  login please try again" ; }  Here we are checking if the user is authenticated using Sentry's authenticate  method and if the user is authenticated, we are sending the user to my account page.  The User dashboard The next page we need to create is the user's dashboard page. User's dashboard page  layout contains tab control which will hold all three user options. Here is the layout  of user's dashboard page.  User dashboard layout  [ 130 ]   We need to create a tab Controller with three pages for creating the user's dashboard.  We would need to register a route for our dashboard page. So here is the code for the  dashboard page with the user profile option:  Route::get 'myaccount', array 'as' => 'myaccount', 'uses' => 'pages@ myaccount'  ;  Now let's write a Controller method for opening a myaccount view:  public function getMyaccount   {   if !Sentry::check   {     return Redirect::to 'login' ->with "error", "Please login to  access your account" ;   }    $user = Sentry::getUser  ;    return View::make "pages.myaccount" ->with "title","The Foldagram -  My Account"    ->with "page_title","My Account" ->with 'class','myaccount'    ->with 'user',$user ;  }  We are making sure that the user is already logged in when he is accessing the  myaccount Controller method and then we are grabbing the current logged in   user's object so that we can display the user information in the view page.  @extends 'layouts.user'   @section 'content'                                   My  Profile             Change Password             My Orders            [ 131 ]                               {{ Form::open  array  'url' => 'myaccount profile'   ; }}                  First Name :<  label>                     <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name"  value="{{ $user['metadata']['first_name'] }}" placeholder="">                                    Last Name :<  label>                     <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" value="{{  $user['metadata']['last_name'] }}" placeholder="">                                    Email :                      <input type="text" name="email" id="email" value="{{  $user['email'] }}" placeholder="">                                            Save              {{ Form::close   }}                       @stop  [ 132 ]   Here we are first having the tab Controller that contains the My Profile tab in the  opened state. And we are using the user object we sent via the Controller to fill in the  values of various fields. Now let's write a method to update the information in the  My Profile tab.  function postProfile  {    $user = Sentry::getUser  ;   $rules = array        'email' => 'requiredemailunique:users,email,'.$user['id'],    ;    $input = Input::get  ;   $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;    if  $validation->fails    {       return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with_input  ->with_ errors $validation ;   }    $user_data = array        'email'    => Input::get 'email' ,     'metadata' => array        'first_name' => Input::get 'first_name' ,       'last_name'  => Input::get 'last_name' ,      ,     ;    if  $user->update $user_data     {       return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with 'success', 'Your  information has been updated successfully.' ;   }   else   {       return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with 'error', 'Something went  wrong!.' ;   }  }  [ 133 ]   Here we first get the user's Eloquent object with Sentry's getUser method. And then  we are validating that the user has updated the e-mail in the correct format using  the Validator class. Then we are creating the user_data array, which holds all the  updated fields and with user's update method we are updating that information.  Change password To change the password, we are going to follow the same process as we did   in the last two sections. Let's add the code in our myaccount.blade.php file   in the tab2 container.       {{ Form::open  array 'url' => 'myaccount changepassword'   ; }}                   Old Password  :                      <input type="password" name="old_password" id="old_password"  value="" placeholder="">                                    New Password :<  label>                     <input type="password" name="password" id="password"  value="{{ Input::old 'password'  }}" placeholder="">                                    Confirm New  Password :                      <input type="password" name="password_confirmation"  id="password_confirmation" value="{{ Input::old 'password_ confirmation'  }}" placeholder="">                                     Save            {{ Form::close   }}      [ 134 ]   The preceding code will display three fields, old password, new password, and  confirm new password. To update the password, let's write a Controller method:  function post_changepassword   {   $rules = array          'old_password' => 'required',         'password' => 'requireddifferent:old_passwordconfirmed',         'password_confirmation' => 'required',      ;      $input = Input::get  ;     $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;      if  $validation->fails    {         return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with_input  ->with_ errors $validation ;     }    try   {       $user = Sentry::getUser  ;       if  $user->change_password Input::get 'password' ,  Input::get 'old_password'          {           return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with 'success', 'You  password  has been updated successfully.' ;       }       else       {           return Redirect::to 'myaccount' ->with 'error', 'You  password has been not update successfully.' ;       }       }   }  We are validating the new password and confirm new password is equal as well as  old password is provided. If validation passes, we are getting the current user by  Sentry's getUser method. Then we are using the changepassword method to change  the user's password. This method will automatically check if the old password is  correct and if it is correct, it will replace the old password with a new password.  [ 135 ]   Checkout & payment gateway integration Jordan reviewed the progress and we both agreed that the user pages look cool.  Now we need to focus on the checkout process as well as the payment gateway  integration. At that time, Jordan told me he needs to have a credit system. By means  of a credit system, he told me he wants to give credit to some of the early beta users  and credits will work in the following way:     Credit is like a point. One point equals one Foldagram.    Credits will have pricing based on range.    He can decide credit pricing.    He can give free credits via backend to some of early users or users who   frequently use the site.     Checkout page needs to have a way to pay via credit.    Users can buy credits separately via the purchase credit page.  He wants to reward the user who is going to buy Foldagrams in large quantities  that is, credit system would work as if you are buying less than five credits, it will  cost you 3.75 dollars. But if you are buying more than five credits, it will cost you  3.45 dollars. Higher the credit, lower the price for each credit. It makes perfect sense  to him as he had customers who were asking for something like that. So after this  sprint, I decided to work out credits workflow in designs of the checkout page with  both the designer and Jordan. And we finally decided that our process will work like  the user will have the following two options to pay:     Pay via credit card: For this method to work, we decided to use the Stripe   payment gateway that helps processing credit cards easily and has a decent  API. In the future, we would need to expand on our options.     Pay via credits: Credits can be purchased in bulk and advanced. User can then  later send a Foldagram to multiple recipients or multiple Foldagrams to many  recipients using this method without having to pay for it every single time.  The designer helped by creating a perfect mockup, which will handle both credit  card and credits method. Basically, he provided two radio buttons and based on the  radio button clicked, another window will pop up which will ask for the information  such as credit card information or will confirm the user that he has enough credits to  send Foldagram via credits. Here is the mockup of the page:  [ 136 ]   Checkout page layout  [ 137 ]   Building the checkout page for credit cards Let's first build our checkout page that will be used for payment via credit card.   We will divide our page in three different sections as follows:     Cart contents    Order information    Credit card information  function getCart  {  First let's create a Controller which will invoke the checkout page view. Here is the  code for that:    $cart_contents = Cart::contents  ;      return View::make 'pages.cart' ->with 'cart_contents', $cart_ contents    ->with "page_title","Cart" ->with "title","The Foldagram - Cart" - >with 'class','cart' ; }  Now as per the Controller method, let's create the cart page in the pages directory  under the view directory:  @section 'content'                        Name         Qty.         Price         Total                    @forelse  $cart_contents as $item                {{ $foldagram_id = '' }}           {{ $item['name'] }}              [ 138 ]             <a href="{{ URL::to 'cart remove ' .  $item['rowid'].' '.$foldagram_id  }}" rel="tooltip" title="Remove the  product" class="btn btn-mini btn-danger"><i class="icon icon-white  icon-remove">                                                 {{ $item['qty'] }}                {{ format_number $item['price']  }}         {{ format_number $item['subtotal']  }}            @empty              Your shopping cart is empty.            @endforelse        Here we are looping through cart items. We have the cart_contents array from the  Controller that we are using to loop through the cart items. And we are then using  $item to display each field from cart.  Next, we need to display order information in our checkout page. Here is the code  that we will add to our cart's view file we created in the preceding section:        Billing information       Full Name *     <input class="required input-xxlarge" type="text" name="fullname"  id="fullname">        Country *     <input class="required input-xlarge" type="text" name="country"  id="country">       Address 1 *    <input class="required input-xxlarge" type="text" name="address_one"  id="address_one">        Address 2    [ 139 ]     <input class="input-xxlarge" type="text" name="address_two"  id="address_two">        City *     <input class="required input-xlarge" type="text" name="city"  id="city">        State *     <input class="required input-xlarge" type="text" name="state"  id="state">        Zip code *     <input class="required input-xlarge" type="text" name="zipcode"  id="zipcode">           Billing information is formatted with Twitter bootstrap classes to match up to the  designer's lookup. Next is the credit card's markup for the checkout page. Here is   the code for that:           Payment      <div class="payment-errorme alert alert-error"  style="display:none">        <button type="button" class="close" data- dismiss="alert">&times;                      {{ Form::label 'credit_owner', 'Card Owner *'  }}     {{ Form::xlarge_text 'credit_owner', Input::old 'credit_owner' ,  array 'class'=>'required'   }}     {{ Form::block_help 'Enter credit card woner.' }}      {{ Form::label 'credit_card', 'Card Number *'  }}     {{ Form::xlarge_text 'credit_number', Input::old 'credit_number' ,  array 'class'=>'card-number required'   }}     {{ Form::block_help 'Enter credit card number.' }}      {{ Form::label 'expiration', 'Expiration *'  }}        {{ Form::select 'month', Config::get 'application.month'   ,Inpu t::old 'month' ,array "class"=>"span1 required card-expiry-month"   }}      {{ Form::select 'year', Config::get 'application.year' ,Input::old  'year' ,array "class"=>"span1 required card-expiry-year"   }}  [ 140 ]       {{ Form::block_help 'Enter credit card number.' }}          {{ Form::label 'code', 'Security code *'  }}     {{ Form::span1_text 'code', Input::old 'code' ,  array 'class'=>'card-cvc required'   }}     {{ Form::block_help 'Enter security code.' }}      Now we have the checkout page's markup generated. To process the information,  we would need to save the information into our database and verify the credit card  payment and add it once the order is confirmed. So how do we process payments?  Integrating Stripe payment gateway For processing the Stripe payment gateway, we will use abodeo Stripe package  from packagist.org. The package is meant for Laravel 4 and allows us to access   the Stripe payment gateway API. So let's first install the package.  In composer.json add the following line in dependencies:  "abodeo laravel-stripe": "dev-master"  And run the Composer update and also add abodeo as service provider;  'Abodeo\LaravelStripe\LaravelStripeServiceProvider'  Then publish the configuration files of package via the artisan command:  php artisan config:publish abodeo laravel-stripe  Now we will have a configuration file for the package at app config packages  abodeo laravel-stripe stripe.php. Let's edit that file with the information we  get after registration.  return array    'api_key' => 'my-api-key',   'publishable_key' => 'my-pub-key'  ;  Here we need to change the api and pub keys to the keys given in the account  settings by Stripe. Once we update that, we can call the stripe API from our   server to process credit cards.  [ 141 ]   Creating the checkout order process Now let's create the order process that will charge the user's credit card and save   the order into database. Let's create the checkout method in our pages Controller   for order process.  function checkout  {    $order = new Order;   $cart_contents = Cart::contents  ;    foreach   $cart_contents as $item  {        $order->qty = $item['qty'];        $order->price = $item['price'];   }    $order->foldaram_id =Input::get 'foldagram_id' ;   $order->email = Input::get 'email' ;   $order->fullname = Input::get 'fullname' ;   $order->country = Input::get 'country' ;   $order->address_one = Input::get 'address_one' ;   $order->address_two = Input::get 'address_two' ;   $order->city = Input::get 'city' ;   $order->state = Input::get 'state' ;   $order->zipcode = Input::get 'zipcode' ;      $total_amount = Cart::total  ;    $response = Stripe_Charge::create      array        "amount" =>$total_amount,       "currency" => "usd",       "card" => Input::get 'stripeToken'  ,       "description" => "Foldagram Payment"          ;  [ 142 ]  Here first we are saving the order into the database via the order Model. We are   using our Cart package to get the cart contents and at last we are calculating the   cart total. As we have the cart total, let's write some code to charge the user's credit   card for that total.   The preceding code will charge customer's credit card, the total amount that we  get from our Cart package. Isn't it awesome? Just a few lines of code and our Cart  package works great together and we can use it to great effect as we don't have to  write tons of lines of code to do that, and we can just use our Laravel packages to  charge the customer's credit card elegantly.  Next is to verify if payment is actually received. Here is the code that will verify  payment and complete the order:  if $response->paid {     $order_data = Order::find $order->original['id'] ;     $order_data->transection_id = $response->id;     $order_data->status = 1;      $order_data->save  ;      $foldagram_data = Foldagram::find Input::get 'foldagram_id'  ;     $foldagram_data->status = 2;     $foldagram_data->user_id = $user;     $foldagram_data->save  ;      Cart->destroy  ;      $userdata = Sentry::user intval $user  ;    }  The preceding code will verify that the transaction is complete and it stores the  transaction details in the order table. We are also updating the Foldagram status  as Jordan needs new orders which are paid for importing them and sending  Foldagram's via backend. At last, we are deleting the cart as the order is completed.  Building the credits section Now it's time to work on the credits section. We would need two tables to manage  the credits. One to manage credits pricing and one to manage the user's credit. We  would need to create a migration first for our credits tables. First let's create the  credit price table migration and run php artisan migrate:  php artisan migrate:make create_credits_table  It will generate the credits table basic schema update with the following schema:  class createCreditTable {    public function up    [ 143 ]     {     Schema::create 'credit', function $table      {       $table->increments 'id' ;       $table->string "rfrom",255 ;       $table->string "rto",255 ;       $table->string "price",255 ;       $table->timestamps  ;      } ;   }  }    public function down     {     Schema::drop 'credit' ;   }  Next, we need to create migration for the user's credit. Let's do that by running the  following migration command:  php artisan migrate:make create_user_credit_orders_table  Also run php artisan migrate that will generate the schema file in the   app database directory, update it with the following schema:  class Create_User_Credit_Order_Table {    public function up     {     Schema::create 'usercreditorders', function $table      {       $table->increments 'id' ;       $table->integer 'user_id' ;       $table->integer 'qty' ;       $table->integer 'price' ;       $table->string "email",255 ;       $table->boolean 'status', array '0', '1'  ->default 0 ;       $table->string "transection_id",255 ;       $table->timestamps  ;     } ;   }    public function down    [ 144 ]     {     Schema::drop 'usercreditorders' ;   }  Now we need to create models for these two tables in the models directory.   So create credit.php and usercreditorders.php in the models directory   and write the following code:  class Credit extends Eloquent {       public static $table = 'credit';       public static $timestamps = true;  } class UserCreditOrders extends Eloquent {       public static $table = 'usercreditorders';  }  }  Now as we have everything set up for credits. Let's work on the Purchase Credit  page for users. Here is our layout for the Purchase Credit page:  Purchase Credit page  [ 145 ]   As you can see the user can decide how many credits he wants to buy and based on  the quantity, he'll get a discount.  First let's build the Controller to display the layout. Here is the code for that:  function get_purchase_credit   {   $credit = Credit::all  ;    return View::make "pages.purchase_credit" ->with "title","The  Foldagram - Purchase Credit"    ->with "page_title","Purchase Credit" ->with 'class','pcredit'    ->with 'credit', $credit ;     }  Here we are getting the whole price range from the credits table and sending   it to our view file. Let's build our purchase_credit.blade.php file in the   views pages directory.  Let's first display prices in the left section of the page:                          Current Price           Foldagrams can either be purchased one at a time, or with  credits. When you pay for credits in advance, you receive a discount.  Don't worry, you don't have to use them all at once! The prices shown  already include postage.          @if $credit                        @foreach $credit as $value               {{ $value->rfrom ." - ". $value->rto ." Foldagrams  -   $".$value->price." each" }}            @endforeach                     @endif          The preceding code will fetch the credit values from the credit array we send   using Controller and build the credits price range table as shown in the Purchase  Credit page screenshot.  [ 146 ]   Let's build the purchase credit form:            {{ Form::open  array   'url'=>'purchasecredit addtocredit'    }}          Purchase Credit                    {{ Form::token   }}                  {{ Form::label 'qty', 'Foldagrams:'  }}          {{ Form::label 'qty', 'Quantity '  }}         {{ Form::span2_text 'qty', '1'  }}&nbsp; &nbsp;         {{ Form::label 'price', 'Per Foldagram'  }}            {{ Form::span2_text 'price','', array 'id'=>'price',  'readonly'=>'readonly'   }}&nbsp; &nbsp;         {{ Form::label 'total', 'Total'  }}            {{ Form::span2_text 'total', '', array 'id'=>'total',  'readonly'=>'readonly'   }}                             {{ Form::submit 'Add to Cart',array "class"=>"btn-large "   }}           {{ Form::close  ; }}            The preceding code will display the Purchase Credit form section. There is one little  thing we still need to do. To update the price when user changes the quantity, we  need to add a JavaScript code into our page. Here is code for that:     $ function    {     $.post base_url+'price ',{ qty:$ 'qty' .val  }, function data  {         $ 'price' .val data ;     } ;  } ;     [ 147 ]   The preceding code will generate the page for the purchase of credits. Now when   the user submits the form, we need to check the user's credit card, charge it with   our Stripe API, and add the credits to the user's account. Here is code for that:  public function post_addtocredit   {    $credit = Credit::where 'rfrom','<=',intval Input::get 'qty'              ->where 'rto',">=",intval Input::get 'qty'   ->order_ by 'rfrom','DESC' ->first  ;    $response = Stripe_Charge::create array          "amount" =>round $credit->price * Input::get 'qty'  ,         "currency" => "usd",         "card" => Input::get 'stripeToken'  ,    obtained with Stripe. js         "description" => "Foldagram Payment"         ;    if $response->paid {     $user = Sentry::getUser  ;     $order_data = new UserCreditOrders;     $order_data->transection_id = $response->id;     $order_data->status = 1;          $order_data->user_id = $user->id;          $order_data->qty = Input::get 'qty' ;          $order_data->price = $credit->price*Input::get 'qty' ;          $order_data->save  ;         } }  The preceding code will find the price from the price range based on quantity entered  by the user. Then our Stripe package will charge the user's credit card based on the  price found via qty*price range found from the credits table. If the transaction is  successful, we are storing the credit quantity in the usercreditorders table.  [ 148 ]   Building the view orders section As we have added functionality to pay via credit card or credits, now it's time to  allow the users to view their orders and see the status of their orders. We need to  display the user's orders in their dashboard screen. Here is the layout for the view  orders from the designer:  User orders  Let's add a code to the third tab of views user dashboard.blade.php file. We  already have the orders array passed to our dashboard View via our dashboard  Controller method. So we can loop through orders easily.       My Order                                   Message               Picture               Status             [ 149 ]                           @if !empty $orders->results               @foreach $orders->results as $value                                         {{ $value->message }}                       @if $value->image!=""                                                           @if File::exists path 'public' .'img  thumbnails '.$value->image                                 {{ HTML::image 'img thumbnails '.$value- >image, "Foldagram Image", array 'width'=>'100px'   }}                             @endif                         @endif                                                    <?php $status = Config::get 'application. status' ; ?>                         @if $value->status=='1'                               {{ Label::important $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='2'                               {{ Label::success $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='3'                               {{ Label::normal $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='4'                               {{ Label::warning $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='5'                               {{ Label::success $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='6'                               {{ Label::success $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @elseif  $value->status=='7'                              {{ Label::success $status[$value- >status] ;  }}                         @endif                                              [ 150 ]               @endforeach         @else                               <td colspan="3" class="sr-align-center" style="text- align: center">There is any order                        @endif          Here in the preceding code, we are looping through the orders array and based on  the status stored in our database, we are displaying different labels to the users about  the order's current status.  Summary So, we learned how we can manage user-related features in Laravel-based web  applications. We have learned how to use Sentry to authenticate users and how  to build sections like user login, user registration, user dashboard, user change  password, and manage profile. We've also learned how we can build the checkout  process and payment gateway integration with web applications. We built the  following sections:     Checkout process    Pay via credit card      Integrated Stripe payment gateway     Pay via credits     View Orders      Pre payments for bulk orders  We have learned how to craft the user section in our Laravel 4 application. We have  also learned how to use packages from packagist.com and use it to a great extent.  Also we have built the frontend of our Foldagram web application. It's time now to  move to the backend section of our web application.  [ 151 ]    The Admin Section  We finished building the frontend for thefoldagram.com in the previous three  chapters. We learned how to use Laravel to create a web application that handles  features such as cart, user credits, and orders. We created our own package for  managing the cart functionality and built pages for the user's dashboard, login,   and registration.  Now, we will learn how to build the administration area of our application.   We will build functionalities such as managing orders and user management, which  will be very useful for our friend Jordan. But first, it's time to meet him again and  show him a demo of the different functions and discuss what he thinks about the  admin section. So we met again, and after discussing the site, he told me that he  would need to be able to to the following things as an administrator.     Log in via a secure web page for the administrative area that normal users   cannot login to     See the orders placed in the application    Update the order in case something requires to be changed    Export the new orders to an Excel file    Manage the price of a Foldagram unit    Manage the price range of Foldagram units based on the quantity of the    user credits     Add credit for users    Add new users    Manage users, that is, update or block or delete them    Change user passwords in case somebody requests a reset   This is the requirement for our second phase of iteration. So let's write down   our requirements as features and try to get an idea of what we would need to  accomplish them:     Building the foundation for the administration section    A login section for administrators    Managing orders    Exporting orders    Managing Foldagram pricing    Adding credit for user    Managing users    Resetting passwords    Blocking users  Building the foundation for the  administration section To manage the backend section, we will create a separate layout with the admin  Controller to hold the key to the backend. All routes of the administration section must  start with  admin as that way we can manage things such as authentication and routes.  Before setting, let's discuss how we will differentiate normal users from  administrators. Well, we will use the groups feature of Sentry, our authentication  package. The way it works is that you set up groups in Sentry and then you add a  user into a particular group; when whoever first accesses the routes you put a check  on who belongs to that group.  Here we need to define an administration group. We will try out this procedure only  once, so I will write a route closure function to achieve it:  Route::get ' creategroup', function   {     try     {            Create the group         $group = Sentry::createGroup array              'name'        => 'Administration',             'permissions' => array                  'read' => 1,                 'write' => 1,  [ 154 ]                ,           ;     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\NameRequiredException $e      {         echo 'Name field is required';     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\GroupExistsException $e      {         echo 'Group already exists';     }  Here, when you run yoursite.com creategroup, Sentry creates the group   named administration with two types of permission: read and write. But what  are permissions? Well, permissions could be anything. Here, in the context of these  chapters, it's for future requirements. For example, if we want to create an administrator  who can only read data from it, we can set those permissions easily via Sentry.  Once the administration group is created, you can safely remove the route closure  for security reasons. If you want to confirm whether the group is created, you can do  so by running following code:  Route::get ' checkgroup', function   {      try     {         $group = Sentry::findGroupByName 'administration' ;     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\GroupNotFoundException $e      {         echo 'Group was not found.';     }  } ;  } ;  When you run yoursite.com checkgroup, Sentry will try to search for the  administration group in its group's tables. If Sentry doesn't find the group,   it will return an error. That way, you will know your group has been created.   Don't forget to delete this closure too.  [ 155 ]   Now you must be wondering about how to create a user that belongs to this group.  Here is how you can do that:  Route::get ' createadminuser', function   {      try     {             Find the group using the group name         $adminGroup = Sentry::findGroupByName "administration" ;             Create the user         $user = Sentry::createUser array              'email'    => 'adminuser@example.com',             'password' => '123456',           ;             Assign the group to the user         $user->addGroup $adminGroup ;     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\PasswordRequiredException $e      {         echo 'Password field is required.';     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\UserExistsException $e      {         echo 'User with this login already exists.';     }     catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Groups\GroupNotFoundException $e      {         echo 'Group was not found.';     }  } ;  We first need to create the user via the Sentry::createUser method. We will  then have a User object. After that, we can find the administration group using the  Sentry::findGroupByName method. Now, via the User object, we have acquired  that we created a user object having an addgroup method which allows us to add  users to the group by just passing our object. If all goes well, Sentry will create a user  adminuser@example.com and add it into the administration group of our application.  [ 156 ]   What if something goes wrong? Sentry will handle the error part via its exceptions.  Say for example, a user with that e-mail address already exists in our database;  Sentry will raise a UserExistsException exception. Similarly, Sentry will handle all  the validations and we don't have to manually check any validations for any groups  or users. Again, for obvious security reasons, don't forget to delete these routes after  creating the administration user.  So now we have a theoretical administration group that will handle the administration  functions of the application. We have created the administrator for our application too.  Let's start working on the structure of the administration application.  To authenticate each admin request, we will create a route group. But what is a route  group? Laravel provides a feature to add filters to a group of routes; this is called  group routing. In group routing, you can define which filter should run before any  route defined in that group is executed.  So we can write a filter that will authenticate the admin user and then use that  filter in the route groups so that the user can be authenticated before any route is  executed. Let's first define our administration filter in our filters.php file:  Route::filter 'administrationauth', function   {     if  Sentry::check        {         $user = Sentry::getUser  ;         $admin = Sentry::findGroupByName 'administration' ;                  if  !$user->inGroup $admin           {             Redirect::to 'login' ;         }          }else{         Redirect::to 'login' ;     } } ;  Here we first check whether a user is logged in or not via the Sentry::check  method. If not, it will redirect the user to the login route. If the user is logged in, the  Sentry::getUser method will return the currently logged in user as an object. Then  we check via the User object whether the user is in the administration group or not.  If they aren't, we redirect them to the login page. This filter will manage the whole  administration authentication part for us.  [ 157 ]   Creating a login section for the  administrator Now as we have the basic code for managing the admin section, let's create a login  section for the site. But first, we need to set up the layout for the admin section. So  let's do that first. First, add a route to our login page as follows:  Route::controller 'admin','admin' ;  Now let's add our admin Controller code with the login method:  class AdminController extends BaseController {      public function getLogin       {         return View::make 'layouts.login' ->with 'title','Foldagram -  Admin' ;     } }  Here, we are loading our login view from the layouts directory. So let's add the  login layout file in our Views directory:                            {{ $title }}          <?php             HTML::style 'admin css bootstrap.css' ;             HTML::style 'admin css style.css' ;             HTML::script 'admin js jquery.js' ;         ?>                                                 The Foldagram                                 [ 158 ]   The preceding code is the header of the login layout file. Note how we are using   HTML::style and HTML::script to add CSS and JS from the public admin css  and public admin js files. Then we will display the Foldagram logo as shown in  the following code snippet:                              @if $errors->has                                <button type="button" class="close" data-                  dismiss="alert">&times;                 Error!                 The following errors have occurred:                                  @foreach  $errors->all ' :message '  as                     $error                  {{ $error }}                 @endforeach                                             @endif  The next section of code in login layout is for errors. If the validation sends back  errors, we can retrieve it via the $errors object. So, the preceding code will loop  through each error message for each field and display the appropriate error.                                      {{ Form::open  array 'url'=> 'admin login'   }}                                                                                                                        Email                          <input type="text" name="username"                             tabindex="1" value="{{                             Input::old 'username' }}"                             placeholder="">                          Password                          <input type="password" name="password"                             tabindex="2" placeholder="">                                                                     <input type="submit" class="btn btn-large                             btn-inverse" value="Login" tabindex="3">                        [ 159 ]                                                                      {{Form::close  }}                  Finally, we have our login form. We are using the Form class to send user   requests to the admin login route via the POST method. Now try to check   the URL at http:  yoursite.com admin login; if all goes right, you will   see the following screen:  Now we need to authenticate the user. Let's first add a post route and send a user  request to our postlogin method of the admin Controller:  Route::post 'admin login', array 'as' => 'adminlogin', 'uses' =>  'admin@login'  ;  Admin login  [ 160 ]   Now, in the admin Controller, we will write postLogin, which will authenticate the  user. Here is our postLogin method code:  public function postLogin   {      $rules = array          'username'  => 'requiredmax:50',         'password' => 'required',      ;          $input = Input::get  ;     $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;      if  $validation->fails        {         return Redirect::to_route 'admin login' ->with_ errors $validation->errors ->with_input  ->with "title","The Foldagram  - Admin " ;     }  In the first section of the postLogin method, we are validating code make sure the  user has filled the login boxes. Next we authenticate the user via Sentry:  try {     $user = Sentry::authenticate Input::all  , false ;     if  Sentry::check        {         $admin = Sentry::findGroupByName 'Administration' ;         if  $user->inGroup $admin           {             return Redirect::route 'orders' ;         }     }     }  Here we first use Sentry to authenticate the user. Then we check whether the user is  authenticated using the check method in Sentry. And lastly, we will make sure the  user is a member of the administration group. If he is a member of this group, we  will redirect him to the orders page.  [ 161 ]   But what if he is not a member of the group or his password is simply wrong?  Well, here is the exception code provided by Sentry; it will raise different types of  exceptions and redirect the user to the login page.  catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\WrongPasswordException $e  {          return Redirect::route 'adminlogin', $id              ->withInput               ->with 'message', 'Password field is required.' ;  } catch  Cartalyst\Sentry\Users\UserNotFoundException $e  {         return Redirect::route 'adminlogin', $id              ->withInput               ->with 'message', 'User is not found in database.' ;     }  Managing orders Now as we have authenticated the user, it's time to set up our dashboard and   admin area. But first, let's write our group routes so that we don't have to check  if user is admin each time we receive a request, and we can then just work on  Controllers and Views:  Route::group array 'before' => 'administrationauth' , function   {     Route::get 'admin orders', array 'as' => 'orders', 'uses' =>  'order@index'  ;     Route::get 'admin user', array 'as' => 'user', 'uses' => 'user@ index'  ;     Route::get 'admin usercredit', array 'as' => 'usercredit', 'uses'  => 'credit@usercredit'  ;     Route::post 'admin usercredit', array 'as' => 'postusercredit',  'uses' => 'credit@usercredit'  ;     Route::get 'admin credit', array 'as' => 'credit', 'uses' =>  'credit@index'  ; } ;  [ 162 ]   We have used Route::group to add a filter to all our admin section routes. Our  administrationauth filter, which we created previously, is used to authenticate  the user before the user can hit the route. This allows us to completely separate our  authentication layer from our business logic. As you can see, we don't have to write  any code further to authenticate the user as all routes in this group will first check  the filter.  Let's get back to the creation of our manage orders section. We would need a  Controller method for that. Here is method for that in the orders Controller:      public function getindex       {             $orders = DB::table 'foldagram'          ->left_join 'users', 'foldagram.user_id', '=', 'users.id'          ->left_join 'foldagram_orders', 'foldagram.id', '=',  'foldagram_orders.foldaram_id'          ->order_by 'foldagram.created_at','DESC'          ->group_by "foldagram.id"          ->paginate Config::get 'application.pager' , array 'users.email',          'foldagram.message',          'foldagram.image',          'foldagram.status',          'foldagram.exported',          'foldagram_orders.id',          'foldagram.id AS fid',            ;          $pager = $orders->links 3, Paginator::ALIGN_LEFT,  Paginator::SIZE_SMALL ;          return View::make 'admin.manage_orders' - >with 'title','Foldagram - Admin'          ->with "page_title","Manage Order"          ->with 'orders',$orders          ->with 'pager',$pager ;               }  [ 163 ]   Here, to display all orders, we use the query method of the database class to fetch  all orders with user information. We are left joining our Foldagram_orders table  with the user table to find the user information attached with each order. We use  Laravel's paginator class to fetch records in sequence with page sets for paging.  Then, we load View from the order layout file in the admin directory. Here is   our order layout file:  @extends 'layouts.admin'  @section 'content'  {{ Form::open  array  'url' => 'admin orders search'   }}    Order Status : &nbsp;  {{ Form::select 'status', array '0'=>'-- Select Status  --' +Config::get 'application.status' ,Input::get 'status' ,  array 'class'=>'input-medium'   }}   <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Search" class="btn btn-info  " style="display: inline-block"> {{ Form::close   }}  Here we first load our main template file from layouts admin.blade.php and  then override the content section with our order page content. We first allow the  administrator to sort the orders via the status dropdown. Here we have all the  common statuses from our config file.  Here is the status array that we load from the config file:  'status'=>array          '1'=>'Payment Pending',         '2'=>'Order Accepted',         '3'=>'Processing',         '4'=>'Foldagram Ready',         '5'=>'Shipping Pending',         '6'=>'On Transit',         '7'=>'Delivered',          ;  Now when user changes their status and presses the search button, we will load the  orders with the user's new status.                                 Order No.               Email               Message   [ 164 ]                Picture               Status               Export Status               Action                             Here we display the order column titles first. Now here's the remaining code:             @foreach $orders->results as $value                                          {{ $value->id }}                       {{ $value->email }}                       {{ $value->message }}                       @if $value->image!=""                               @if File::exists path 'public' .'img  thumbnails '.$value->image                                 {{ HTML::image 'img thumbnails '.$value- >image, "Foldagram Image", array 'width'=>'100px'   }}                             @else                                {{ HTML::image  'img thumbnails 100x100. png'  }}                             @endif                         @endif                                                    <?php $status = Config::get 'application. status' ; ?>                         {{ Label::important $status[$value->status] ;   }}                                                                                 @if $value->exported=="1"                                  {{ Label::success "Exported" ;  }}                             @else                                 {{ Label::normal "Not Exported" ;  }}                             @endif                                                                         <a href="{{ URL::to 'order recipient '  . $value->fid  }}" class="btn">   View  Recipient's &nbsp;                         <a href="{{ URL::to 'order orderdetail ' .  $value->fid  }}" class="btn btn-info">    Order Details &nbsp;  [ 165 ]                           <a href="{{ URL::to 'order update ' . $value- >fid  }}" class="btn btn-success">   Update  Status &nbsp;                         <a href="{{ URL::to 'order delete ' . $value- >fid  }}" class="btn btn-danger">    Delete                                                      @endforeach  Here we loop through orders via $orders->results and display the order details  one by one. Based on the order status, we use Label to display proper labels for the  order. If everything goes right, your yoursite.com admin orders screen should  look like this:  Admin manage orders  [ 166 ]   Now we need to write four functions for each order so that the administrator can  manage the orders easily. The four functions are as follows:     View recipients    Order details    Update status    Delete  Building the view recipients section Administrator should be able to view recipients of orders via this feature. So let's  write a Controller method for that.  public function getrecipient $id=""  {              $reff = DB::table 'foldagram_reff_address' ->where 'foldaram_ id','=',$id ->paginate Config::get 'application.pager'  ;          $pager = $reff->links 3, Paginator::ALIGN_LEFT, Paginator::SIZE_ SMALL ;      return View::make 'admin.view_recipeint' ->with 'title','Foldagram  - Admin'      ->with "page_title","List of Recipient's"      ->with 'reff',$reff      ->with 'pager',$pager ; }  We are running a query to find the recipient of the Foldagram by querying the  Foldagram_ref_address table. We are using the paginator class to generate   pages for the records. Let's write a View code for displaying query results.  @extends 'layouts.admin'  @section 'content'   Foldagram Recipient's Address   <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed    sr-table">               @if !empty $reff->results                             @foreach $reff->results as $value                                         Recipient's Address {{ $i++ }}    [ 167 ]                                                                                                            {{ $value->fullname}}                         {{  $value->address_one }}                                                                           @endforeach         @else                                Record Not Found                        @endif         {{ $pager }} @end  The preceding code will display all recipients in tabular format for a particular order.  We use $reff returned from Controller to generate results.  Building the order details section The next feature we need to build is to display order-specific information such as  transaction ID, quantity, price, and user information. Let's write a Controller method  for that.  public function getorderdetail $id  {              $order_detail = Orders::where 'foldaram_id','=',$id ->first  ;          return View::make 'admin.view_order_details' - >with 'title','Foldagram - Admin'      ->with "page_title","Order Details"      ->with 'order_detail', $order_detail->original ; }  Here we are using our Eloquent model orders to fetch the records based on the  Foldagram ID and sending our Eloquent object to our view_order_details file.  [ 168 ]   Here is the view_order_details file in the views admin directory to display   order detail:  @extends 'layouts.admin'  @section 'content'   Foldagram Order Details    <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed   -table">               @if !empty $order_detail                                          Transection ID   :                       {{ $order_detail->transection_id }}                                                            Quantity :                       {{ $order_detail->qty }}                                                            Price :                       {{ $order_detail->price }}                                                            Discount :                       {{ $order_detail->discount_amount }}                                                             Total :                       {{  $order_detail->qty * $order_detail->price   - $order_detail->discount_amount }}                                                            Email :                       {{ $order_detail->email }}                                                            Full Name :                       {{ $order_detail->fullname }}                             @stop  [ 169 ]   Here we display data from the $order_detail Eloquent object we got from the  Controller. We calculate the total based on quantity. Here is what it looks like:  Order details page  Updating order status Our next task is to build the update status page. We need to allow the administrator  to change the status of the order. Let's build a Controller and View for that. Here is  our Controller for getting the update status screen:  public function getupdate $id  {     if !empty $id  {      $foldagram = Foldagram::find $id ;        return View::make 'admin.update_status' - >with 'title','Foldagram - Admin'   [ 170 ]       ->with "page_title","Foldagram Update Status"      ->with 'foldagram', object  $foldagram->original ;      }else{         Redirect::to 'admin' ;     } }  We are loading the Foldagram Eloquent object with the Foldagram ID and sending it  to our View. Let's create the View file at  views admin update_status.  @extends 'layouts.admin'  @section 'content'         {{ Form::open  array 'url' =>'order update'  ; }}           id }}">                    Message :                      {{ $foldagram->message }}                                    Picture :                      @if $foldagram->image!=""            {{ HTML::image 'img thumbnails '.$foldagram->image,  "Foldagram Image", array 'width'=>'100px'   }}                                    Current Status :<  label>                                 {{ Label::important $status[$foldagram->status] ;  }}                                    Change Status :                      {{ Form::select 'status', array '0'=>'-- Select Status  --' +Config::get 'application.status' ,$foldagram->status,  array 'class'=>'input-medium'   }}            [ 171 ]                             Save            {{ HTML::link_to_route 'orders', 'Cancel', '',  array 'class'=>'btn'   }}          {{ Form::close   }}        @stop  Here we display data from Foldagram into form inputs and are fetching status from  the config file and setting it up via Foldagram's current status. If the admin wants  to change the status he can do so by changing the value from the dropdown. Here is  how our View file will be displayed:  Updating order status  [ 172 ]   We would still need to write a method so that when the admin submits the updated  status it will be saved. Here is a Controller method that will update the order status:  public function postUpdate   {     $foldagram = Foldagram::find Input::get 'id'  ;     $foldagram->status=Input::get 'status' ;          if $foldagram->save   {         return Redirect::to_route 'orders' ->with 'success',  'Foldagram order has been status updated successfully.' ;     } }  Deleting orders The last thing we need to do in the manage order page is to write a function that  will allow the admins to delete the order. Generally, I don't allow deleting things  unless it's absolutely necessary and because if you remove records that have many  references, there will be a lot of errors in related pages. Also, sometimes a vital piece  of information can be deleted by mistake.  But in this case, Jordan wanted this feature to remove dummy orders or spam orders.  He had no intention of deleting any order that is paid for by the user. We agreed that  we will remove the record from the database. Here is the code for that:  public function getdelete $id=""      {                      if !empty $id  {                          $foldagram = Foldagram::find $id ->delete  ;             $raddress = Raddress::where 'foldaram_id','=',$id - >delete  ;             $order_detail = Orders::where 'foldaram_id','=',$id - >delete  ;              if $foldagram {                 return Redirect::to_route 'orders' ->with 'success',  'Foldagram order has been deleted successfully.' ;             }else {                 return Redirect::to_route 'orders' - >with 'error',"order not deleted, please try again" ;  [ 173 ]               }                          }else {             return Redirect::to_route 'orders' ->with 'error',"order  not deleted, please try again" ;          }              }  Here we are checking if the ID given already exists in the database and we are  deleting records from Foldagram, reference address and order detail page via  Eloquent's delete method. That completes our manage orders page functionality list.  Exporting orders The next task in our queue is to allow Jordan to export new orders that are paid in  the Excel format so that he can print Foldagram easily as per new orders.  public function get_csvexport   {       $output = Foldagram::with 'foldagram_reff_address'                  ->where 'foldagram_orders.status','=',1                  ->where 'foldagram.status','=',2                  ->where 'foldagram.exported','=',0 ->get  ;      $file = fopen 'dummy path file.csv', 'w' ;     foreach  $output as $row  {         fputcsv $file, $row->to_array   ;     }     fclose $file ;      $headers = array          'Content-Type' => 'text csv',         'Content-Disposition' => 'attachment; filename="$file"',       ;      return Response::make $file, 200, $headers ; }  The preceding code will first gather data via Eloquent loading method and save   data into the file temporarily. Then admin can download the file as we are passing  the download headers within the response.  [ 174 ]   Managing Foldagram pricing The next functionality we need to build for the administrator is to manage the  pricing per Foldagram based on range. Jordan wants to give discounts to users who  buy credits  buy credits and prepay for Foldagram . Say if you are buying seven  credits, you will pay less as the Foldagram price will depend on the range as follows:     1 to 4 Foldagrams: 4 USD Foldagram or per credit    5 to 10 Foldagrams: 3.5 USD Foldagram or per credit    11 to 20 Foldagrams: 3 USD Foldagram or per credit  We will need to build an interface that will allow our admin to add price and also  manage pricing. Let's start building an interface for to add pricing.  Adding pricing  As you can see, the interface is quite simple; we just need to ask admin about  the "from" quantity and the "to" quantity and the price for that range. Here is the  Controller and View file for generating the form:      public function getadd       {                  return View::make 'admin.add_credit' -            >with 'title','Foldagram - Admin'          ->with "page_title","Add Price" ;     }  [ 175 ]   Let's write a View file at views admin add_credit:  {{ Form::open  array   'url' => 'admin credit add'   }}             Form Qty :              <input type="text" name="rfrom" id="rfrom" value="{{  Input::old 'rfrom'  }}" placeholder="Form Qty">                    To Qty :              <input type="text" name="rto" id="rto" value="{{  Input::old 'rto'  }}" placeholder="To Qty">                    Price :              <input type="text" name="price" id="price" value="{{  Input::old 'price'  }}" placeholder="Price">                      Save        {{ link_to_route 'credit', 'Cancel', '', array 'class'=>'btn'    }}      {{ Form::close   }}  Here we generate a form with three fields which will be posted at the credit  Controller's postadd method. Let's write some code to save those inputs into   the database:  public function postadd   {     $credit = new Credit  ;      $credit->rfrom = Input::get 'rfrom' ;     $credit->rto = Input::get 'rto' ;  [ 176 ]       $credit->price = Input::get 'price' ;          if $credit->save   {         return Redirect::to_route 'credit' ->with 'success', 'Price  has been added successfully.' ;     }else {         return Redirect::to_route 'addcredit' ->with_errors $credit- >errors ->with_input  ->with "title","The Foldagram - Admin" ;     } }  In the postadd method, we first retrieve values for all inputs and then save it to our  credit Eloquent object via the save method. These values are fetched by the frontend  wherever we display use pricing of the Foldagram.  Adding credit for the user Jordan said he wanted to give credits to some of his early users as well as buyers  who would purchase Foldagram in large quantities. We need to create a form where  the admin can select a user from the dropdown and add a number of credits to  that account. When they have credits, they can buy Foldagrams with those credits  without paying via credit card.  Let's write a Controller method to first fetch all users and render the View file:  public function getusercredit   {     $users = Sentry::user  ->all  ;      $userarray = array  ;     foreach $users as $value {         $userarray[$value['id']] = $value['email'];     }      return View::make 'admin.user_credit' ->with 'title','Foldagram -  Admin'      ->with "page_title","Give User Credit"      ->with 'users',$userarray         ; }  [ 177 ]   Here we first create an array of all users with key as ID and value as e-mail so we can  easily display dropdown in our View file with that information. So let's write our  View file at  views admin user_credit.blade.php:        {{ Form::open  array  'url'=>'admin usercredit'   }}                         Select User :                       {{ Form::select 'user_email', array ''=>"-- Select User  --" +$users,Input::old 'user_email'  ;}}                                        Credit :                      <input type="text" name="credit" id="credit" value="{{  Input::old 'credit'  }}" placeholder="">                                      Save            {{ link_to_route 'user', 'Cancel', '',  array 'class'=>'btn'   }}          {{ Form::close   }}          Here we are using the form helper's select method to generate our dropdown with  the user's e-mails. When the user submits this form, it will be posted in the credit  Controller's postusercredit method:  public function postusercredit   {     $user = Sentry::findUserByLogin  Input::get 'user_email'   ;     $credit = $user['metadata']['credit'] + Input::get 'credit' ;      $update = $user->update array          'metadata' => array              'credit'  =>  $credit,                 ;      if  $update   [ 178 ]       {         return Redirect::to 'admin user' ->with 'success','Hey! User  credit has been updated successfully' ;             }     else     {         return Redirect::to 'admin usercredit' ->with 'error','Hey!  User credit has been not updated successfully' ;             } }  Here we first fetch the user via Sentry's FinduserbyLogin method, which will find  the user with their e-mail in our system. Then we update the user with their new  credit balance, which is the total of sum of their last credit balance and new credit  entered by the admin.  Managing users The next section that we need to build now is managing users in our system. We will  need to build an interface from where the admin can add, edit, or delete users.  We also need to build the following two features Jordan requested:     Block user    Change user password  What we want to do is manage all this user-related functionality via one screen so  the admin can easily do all these tasks. Here is the layout we decided and found that  it would be easier to work with:  Managing users  [ 179 ]   In this one screen, the admin has all the functions such as block user or edit user and  can change a user's password or other information if required. We also have an Add  User button, which will allow a user to add a new user into the system. To add routes, we will add a Resource Controller, which will respond to  UserController requests:  Route::controller 'users', 'UserController' ;  Let's first build our interface for managing users. We need to add the getindex  method in our user's controller.  public function getIndex   {     $users =DB::table 'users'      ->join 'users_metadata', 'users.id', '=', 'users_metadata.user_ id'      ->paginate Config::get 'application.pager'  ;      $pager = $users->links 3, Paginator::ALIGN_LEFT, Paginator::SIZE_ SMALL ;      return View::make 'admin.manage_user' ->with 'title','Foldagram -  Admin'      ->with "page_title","Manage User"      ->with 'users',$users      ->with 'pager',$pager ; }  Here we fetch all users' records with all metadata and bind it with the pagination  class's method paginate for generating pages. Let's build our manage_user View at  views admin manage_user.blade.php:  @extends 'layouts.admin'  @section 'content'   <table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed  sr- table">                              First Name               Last Name               Email               Credit               Status               User Type               Action   [ 180 ]                                     @if !empty $users->results    In our header section of View, we are extending our admin template. Up next are the  table columns, which are used for displaying a user's fields in columns as a title in  the template. Now here is the second section of our user layout:              @foreach $users->results as $value                                         {{ $value->first_name }}                       {{ $value->last_name }}                       {{ $value->email }}                       {{ $value->credit }}                       @if $value->status=="1"                               Active<  span>                         @endif                         @if $value->status=="0"                              <span class="label label- important">Block                          @endif                                              id   }}" class="btn">   Edit                          <a href="{{ URL::to 'user delete ' . $value- >id  }}" class="btn btn-danger">    Delete                          @if $value->status=="1"                              <a href="{{ URL::to 'user block ' .  $value->id  }}" class="btn btn-danger">    Block                          @endif                         @if $value->status=="0"                              <a href="{{ URL::to 'user active ' .  $value->id  }}" class="btn btn-success">    Active                          @endif                         <a href="{{ URL::to 'usercreditorder ' .  $value->id  }}" class="btn btn-info">    Purchase Credit Order                                                      @endforeach  [ 181 ]           @else                                No Users  Found                        @endif         {{ $pager }} @stop  The preceding code block loops through users found via our $users Eloquent object.  In each column, it displays the user's information. We generate links for each of our  sections such as edit, delete, and block via the URL::to method.  Adding users Let's build the other part of user management code one by one. First is the user  section. Via this section, we can add users to the site directly as an admin. As always,  we would need to add the Controller and View file first. Let's create our Controller  method in the user Controller:  public function getadd   {      return View::make 'admin.add_user' ->with 'title','Foldagram -  Admin'  ->with "page_title","Add User" ;  }  Here we just render our View add_user via View::make. Let's write our View file at  views admin adduser.  {{ Form::open  array  'url' => 'admin user add'    }}          First Name :              <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" value="{{  Input::old 'first_name'  }}" placeholder="">                    Last Name :         [ 182 ]         <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" value="{{  Input::old 'last_name'  }}" placeholder="">                    Email :              <input type="text" name="email" id="email" value="{{  Input::old 'email'  }}" placeholder="">                    Password :              <input type="password" name="password" id="password" value="{{  Input::old 'password'  }}" placeholder="">                    Confirm Password :<  label>             <input type="password" name="password_confirmation"  id="password_confirmation" value="{{ Input::old 'password_ confirmation'  }}" placeholder="">                    Save        {{ HTML::link_to_route 'user', 'Cancel', '',  array 'class'=>'btn'   }}      {{ Form::close   }}  Here we use a form helper to post forms to the adduser method of our user Controller.  Let's write a post method of the adduser object to save the user into the database:  public function postadd   {     $data = array  ;     $rules = array          'email' => 'requiredemailunique:users',         'password' => 'requiredconfirmed',         'password_confirmation' => 'required'  [ 183 ]        ;      $input = Input::get  ;     $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;      if  $validation->fails    {         return Redirect::to 'admin user add' ->with_input  ->with_ errors $validation ; }  Here we first validate input and make sure all fields for creating users are there. If the  validator object returns false, then we redirect the user to the with_errors form.  $rules = array      'email' => 'requiredemail',     'password' => 'required',  ;  $input = Input::get  ; $validation = Validator::make $input, $rules ;  if  $validation->fails    {     return Redirect::to 'admin user add' ->with_input  ->with_ errors $validation ; }   $user = Sentry::createuser array      'email'    => Input::get 'email' ,     'password' => Input::get 'password' ,     'metadata' => array          'first_name' => Input::get 'first_name' ,         'last_name'  => Input::get 'last_name' ,         'credit'  => 0,         ;  return Redirect::to 'admin user' ->with 'success','Hey! User has been  added successfully' ;  The preceding code block will save the user with the information provided in the  form. We are using Sentry::createuser.  [ 184 ]   Editing users We will be editing users just like we added users. The only difference between these  two sections is in the postedituser method. In this method, we will need to update  the user via the Sentry::Save method. Here is the code for the Sentry::Save  method as a boilerplate code for both add and edit would be the same:  $user = Sentry::findUserById $id ;  $user->password = Input::get 'password' ; $user->metadata = array                      'first_name' => Input::get 'first_name' ,                     'last_name'  => Input::get 'last_name' ,                     'credit'  => 0,                    ;  if  $user->save    {     return Redirect::to 'admin user' ->with 'success','Hey! User info  has been updated successfully' ; }  Here we first use the finduserbyid method to find the user, update user info via the  $user object, and save the user via the $user->save method.  Deleting users To delete a user, we need to first find the user and then, via Sentry, remove the user  from the database. Here is code for that:  public function get_delete $id=null  {     try     {          $user = Sentry::findUserById 1 ;         $delete = $user->delete  ;          if  $delete          {             return Redirect::to_route 'user' ->with 'success', 'User  has been deleted successfully.' ;         }         else         {  [ 185 ]               return Redirect::to_route 'user' ->with 'error',"User not  deleted, please try again" ->with "title","The Foldagram - Admin" ;         }     } }  Blocking users The final feature we need to build is to block the user. It helps manage those users  who post spam on forms. Let's write a block method in our user's Controller:  public function get_block $id=null  {     $throttle = Sentry::findThrottlerByUserId $id ;     $blocked = $throttle->suspend  ;          if  $blocked      {         return Redirect::to_route 'user' ->with 'success', 'User has  been blocked successfully.' ;     }     else     {         return Redirect::to_route 'user' ->with 'error',"User not  block, please try again" ->with "title","The Foldagram - Admin" ;     }      }  To block the user, we use the Sentry::findthrottlerByUserId method, which will  fetch the user, and then we can use the suspend method in the object provided by  Sentry. This will block the user from logging in for the next few hours or days based on  the configuration value SuspensionTime provided in the Sentry configuration file.  [ 186 ]   Summary In this chapter, we have learned how to create the admin dashboard for our  applications. We have also learned the following topics:     Building the administration section foundation    Log in section for administrators    Exporting and managing orders    Managing Foldagram pricing    Adding credit for the user    Managing users    Resetting passwords  We have completed our Foldagram web application with this chapter. In the next  chapter, we will learn how to build the RESTful APIs with Laravel.  [ 187 ]    Building a RESTful API with  Laravel – Store Locator  In this chapter we will learn how to create REST APIs in Laravel 4. We will create a  simple store locator API that will have a RESTful backend for sending API results.  We will also build a frontend that will show you how to utilize APIs created via  Laravel 4.  In this chapter we will cover the following topics:     REST and its basics    A store locator's single page web application    Creating a REST API in Laravel 4 using Resource Controllers    Creating a RESTful backend    Creating an API to view all the stores    Building an API method for viewing an individual store    Creating an API method for searching the stores    Building an add store method of our API    Creating an update store method of our API    Creating an API method for deleting a store    Creating a frontend via the Restful API   REST basics First let's learn what REST is. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.   It's an architectural style developed by World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  or a  web model.  The REST architecture is designed using the following components:     Clients: Clients initiate a request.    Servers: Servers process and respond to requests.    Resource: Resource is a concept to describe things based on the usage of your   API. So if you are developing an API for an e-commerce product company,  the product is the resource.  REST uses HTTP request methods to describe the API. Mixing resources with the  HTTP request type gives you the REST architecture. Another thing that is required  for handling data is the media type of the data. Mostly, JSON is used as the media  type for REST APIs. Here is a sample architecture describing REST.  Assume that we are developing a sample architecture for managing people via the  REST API for a government application. So http:  sample.com API v1 persons   is the base URI for our API. Here API can be changed many times over a period  of time, so versioning your API will help developers to know which features are  available on which version. This is the reason why we will use V1 in our API.  Here is a table describing some common functions that our API will provide:  Resource  POST  GET  PUT  DELETE   persons   persons 1   create  Creates a new  person Not used with this  resource   read  Lists all the  persons Shows a  person with  the ID 1   update  Updates all  the persons Updates if a  person with  the ID 1  exists   delete  Deletes all the  persons Deletes the  person with the  ID 1  Here, as you can see, we would be able to manage our application via our resource  persons easily. And these structures allow many departments of the government to  work on the project later if they need to add, update, or delete data from other systems.  So this is where the REST API shines and gives some great structure to work with  projects where you don't know how the end point system will be developed.  [ 190 ]   A store locator's single page web  application We need to build an application for a multinational retail company having a lot   of departments and resellers in different countries. The challenge is to establish a  REST API structure that can be used by resellers or departments that have their   web applications built in different platforms. So they can just call our REST APIs   for having the APIs displayed in different retail stores.  We also need to build a frontend for the main site that will call our REST API and  display all the nearby stores on the Google map. We would also need to create an  authentic mechanism for departments that can add, edit, or delete stores within the  API. We will use Laravel's Resource Controllers to create our API.  Creating a REST API in Laravel 4 using  Resource Controllers Resource Controllers are an easy way to create a REST API in Laravel 4 around its  resources. Laravel 4 removes a lot of boilerplate code that we have to write, which  we would have to write if we start our API from scratch. Let's generate the Resource  Controller for our application. We need to create our API around the stores  resource. So let's create the Resource Controller via the artisan command:  $ php artisan controller:make StoreController  This command will generate a Controller StoreController.php file at   app controllers . If you check the file, you will find boilerplate Controller  methods to use with the API. You will be thinking, "How does Laravel know   about these files as we haven't declared routes for all these methods?" Here's another  surprise; you just need one route line to use all these methods. The route declaration  needed to register our Controller as Resource Controller is shown as follows:  Route::resource 'store', 'StoreController' ;  [ 191 ]   Route::resource is the way we can register our Resource Controllers with Laravel.  This single route line will handle all our REST API calls. Here is the list of routes it  will handle for us:  PATH  Action  Route Name  HTTP  Method GET GET POST GET   store  store create  store  store {id}  GET PUT PATCH DELETE   store {id} edit  store {id}  store {id}  To view all the stores To create a new store To save new store To show a store with  {id} To edit the store To update the store To destroy the store  store.index store.create store.store store.show  store.edit store.update store.destroy  Here the route name will match our Resource Controller's boilerplate methods.  That's how Laravel manages routing automatically for all the routes.  If you want to check all your routes via the command line, artisans have  a great command for that. Just type in the following command: $ php artisan routes The preceding command will display the list of all the routes registered  within the application. It will also show you the hidden routes that  Laravel manages in case of Resource Controllers.  Creating a RESTful backend Now as we have set up our Resource Controller, we need to set up other backend  options, such as database and authentication.  First we need to set up the database structure of our application. Here are the two  tables required for doing this:     stores: This table is to manage all the stores    users: This table is to manage the users of an application  The stores table will have the following fields:     id    name  [ 192 ]      address    city    postcode    state    country    latitude    longitude    support_phone    support_email     id    username    password  The users table will have the following fields:  Let's write migrations to create tables in our database:  $ php artisan migrate:make create_stores_table --table=stores     --create $ php artisan migrate:make create_users_table --table=users     --create  This will set up our schema files at app database migrations. First let's edit our  stores migration file to add fields.      Schema::create 'stores', function Blueprint $table      {         $table->increments 'id' ;         $table->string 'name' ;         $table->string 'address' ;         $table->string 'city' ;         $table->string 'zip' ;         $table->string 'state' ;         $table->string 'country' ;         $table->string 'latitude' ;         $table->string 'longitude' ;         $table->string 'support_phone' ;         $table->string 'support_email' ;         $table->integer 'user_id' ;         $table->timestamps  ;     } ;  [ 193 ]   Now let's edit the users migration file to add users table's fields.      Schema::create 'users', function Blueprint $table      {         $table->increments 'id' ;         $table->string 'username' ;         $table->string 'password' ;         $table->timestamps  ;     } ;  Let's run migrations so our artisan command can create our tables in the database:  $ php artisan migrate  We would also need to create a model for our stores table so we can access the table  via the Eloquent object. Let's create a file at app model stores.php:  class Store extends Eloquent {       protected $table = 'stores';   }  Route::filter 'Apiauth', function   {     return Auth::basic "username" ; } ;  For the users table Laravel already provides us with model users. Laravel also  provides us with the basic authentication, so let's use that to create a filter:  To authenticate users we will use Laravel's route groups as well as prefix the  API with a custom parameter. We would need to wrap our resource route with  Route::group:  Route::group array 'prefix' => 'locator api service v1', 'before'     => 'Apiauth' , function   {     Route::resource 'store', 'StoreController' ; } ;  The previous code will allow us to authenticate each request to our API as we are  using the before parameter with our filter to authenticate a user. We are using a  prefix, so any requests that are made at example.com locator api service v1  will hit our API. So we have everything ready to create our API. Let's create each  option of our API one by one.  [ 194 ]   Creating an API to view all the stores Let's create an API feature to view all the stores. As per the Resource Controller for  all the stores, a request will hit the index method of storecontroller.php:  public function index   {     $stores = Stores::all  ;       return Response::json array          'error' => false,         'stores' => $stores->toArray   ,         200      ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ;; }  Here we are first fetching all the records from stores via the Eloquent object:  stores:all  . Laravel has a unique method of sending a response as a JSON with  the status and error code. Response::Json accepts two arguments: first is an array  that shows the error code and the JSON object with data and the second argument  is the status code of the request. The setcallback   method at the end allows us  to send any custom callback requested by the client side. So this will return all the  stores in the JSON format to the client.  Building an API method for viewing an  individual store To view an individual store, the request method will be the show method of the  store Controller. Let's edit the show method to view the specific store:  public function show $id  {     $store = Stores::find $id ;      return Response::json array          'error' => false,         'store' => $store ,         200      ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ; }  Here, first we are fetching a record via the id parameter passed by the client and  then sending it as a JSON response.  [ 195 ]   Creating an API method for searching the  stores The next option that we need to provide is that of searching the store. A client will  provide us with search options such as city, country, and zip code, and we need to  find it in our database and return all the nearby retail stores. Here the API call will be  like  stores?city=london, but we will send our search data via the get method. So  let's edit our index method as our API will call the index method:  public function index   {     $city = Input::get 'city' ;     $country = Input::get 'country' ;     $zip = Input::get 'zip' ;      If   $city == '' && $country == '' && $zip == '' {         $stores = Store::all  ;         }else{         $stores = DB::table 'store'                  ->where 'city','LIKE',"%$city%"                  ->or_where 'country','LIKE',"%$country%"                  ->or_where 'zip','=',"$zip"                  ->get  ;     }       return Response::json array          'error' => false,         'stores' => $stores->toArray   ,         200      ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ; }  Here first we are checking whether we have any inputs from the user. If there are no  inputs, we are returning all the stores. If there are any inputs, we are using a fluent  query builder to build the query via the DB::table method. After that we are using  the response object to send data in the JSON format.  So we have created methods for reading from an API. Now let's write API methods  that will allow a user to write data via the API.  [ 196 ]   Adding a store method to our API To add a store, our Resource Controller route will call the store method. So let's edit  the store method to save the new store entry given by the client:  public function store   {     $store = new store;     $store->name = Request::get 'name' ;     $store->address = Request::get 'address' ;     $store->city = Request::get 'city' ;     $store->zip = Request::get 'zip' ;     $store->country = Request::get 'country' ;     $store->latitude = Request::get 'latitude' ;     $store->longitude = Request::get 'longitude' ;     $store->support_phone = Request::get 'support_phone' ;     $store->support_email = Request::get 'support_email' ;     $store->user_id = Auth::user  ->id;      if  $store->save    {              return Response::json array              'error' => false,             'msg' => 'store created successfully.',             200          ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ;        }else{          return Response::json  array              'error' => true,             'msg' => 'issue creating store!' ,             200          ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ;      }      }  Here we are saving the store method first. If it's saved, we would send the success  code with the success message via the msg variable; if it's not created, we would send  an error. We are also saving the user ID with the current authenticated user's ID for  managing who created the store.  [ 197 ]   Updating the store method of our API To update the store method, we would need to change the update method as it is  the method called by Laravel when either PUT or PATCH request is sent via the client.  Let's write the update method to allow the store to be edited by the client:  public function update $id  {     $store = Store::find $id ;      $store->name = Request::get 'name' ;     $store->address = Request::get 'address' ;     $store->city = Request::get 'city' ;     $store->zip = Request::get 'zip' ;     $store->country = Request::get 'country' ;     $store->latitude = Request::get 'latitude' ;     $store->longitude = Request::get 'longitude' ;     $store->support_phone = Request::get 'support_phone' ;     $store->support_email = Request::get 'support_email' ;     $store->user_id = Auth::user  ->id;      if  $store->save    {              return Response::json array              'error' => false,             'msg' => 'store has been updated',             200          ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ;        }else{          return Response::json  array              'error' => true,             'msg' => 'issue updating store!' ,             200          ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ;      }      }  To update the store, we first need to find the store from the database via the  Store::find method. Then, we would use the properties of the Eloquent object to  update individual properties of the record. If the record is updated, we would send  the response with the success message or else the error message.  [ 198 ]   Creating an API method for deleting a store  client To delete a store client, we will send a request via the delete method and the  request will have a store ID. Our resource stores will send a request to the destroy  method. So let's update the destroy method to remove a store sent by the client.  public function destroy $id  {     $store = Store::find $id ;       if !empty $store       $store->delete  ;       return Response::json array          'error' => false,         'msg' => 'Store deleted' ,         200          ->setCallback Input::get 'callback'  ; }  Here we are first finding a store via the store Eloquent object's find method. Then  via the Eloquent object's delete method, we are deleting the user.  So that's how you can write via an API. With Laravel 4 we have seen it's very easy to  write APIs. As it provides a lot of boilerplate code as well as intelligent methods that  we can use directly, it saves a lot of time and APIs are really elegant to work with.  You might be wondering how can we test all these APIs we created. We can test it in  two ways:     Curl: This is a command-line tool    POSTMAN: This is a chrome extension that allows testing APIs even in local   development environments  Let's test our API with curl. Say, if we want to retrieve all the stores, we will need to  write the following command with curl:  $ curl --user test:test example.com locator api service v1 stores  If the username and password is correct, the preceding command will have the  following output:  {     "error": false,     "stores": [        {  [ 199 ]               "id":1,             "name":"NY store",             "address":"times square",             "city": "new york",             "zip": "10032"             "country": "usa",             "latitude": "40.6700",             "longitude": "73.9400",             "created_at": "2013-02-01 02:39:10",             "updated_at": "2013-02-01 02:39:10",             "user_id": "1"         },         {             "id":2,             "name":"London store",             "address":"30 Leicester Square",             "city": "London",             "zip": "WC2H 7LA"             "country": "London",             "latitude": "51.5072",             "longitude": "0.1275",             "created_at": "2013-02-01 02:39:10",             "updated_at": "2013-02-01 02:39:10",             "user_id": "1"                 }     ] }  Here if you observe the output, it has timestamps; if you don't want to show  timestamps or any other column, you can insert a hidden property in your   model as follows:  protected $hidden = array 'created_at','updated_at' ;  For testing with POSTMAN, you will need to have a chrome browser. Once you open  chrome, open the following link for chrome extensions:     https:  chrome.google.com webstore category extensions  In the top-left box search for Postman - REST Client and click on the first result.   A pop up will open with information about the extension. Click on the install   button at the top-right corner of the pop up. Once you have installed POSTMAN click on the second tab titled basic auth; enter the  URL, username, and password; and click on the send button. It will display all the  information about the request as well as the response in the same window.  [ 200 ]   So choose your favorite tool and start testing the whole API. We have finished  creating our API's backend and it's time to move onto the frontend section. Let's  learn how we can utilize REST APIs and create the store locator's frontend.  Creating a frontend via a RESTful API Let's build a frontend for searching our stores on Google maps via our REST API. To  set up the frontend, I have used jQuery and the Google Maps Store Locator plugin.  Here is the preview page of our application:  Here is code for creating a layout similar to the preceding figure:  Store locator – Google maps               Store Locator               [ 201 ]                                                                             Enter Address or Zip                   Code:                                                           Submit                                                                                              <script src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-        1.10.1.min.js">             <script         src="http:  maps.google.com maps api js?        sensor=false">                         $ function   {           $ 'map-container' .storeLocator {'dataType': 'json',               'dataLocation': 'example.com locator api               service v1 stores.json'} ;         } ;                 [ 202 ]   Here we have a form that will ask the user for the zip code or the city name which  will be submitted to our REST API. Then we have a map container that is initialized  at the end of the page via the storelocator method. We are passing the JSON file  that will be generated by our API we created in earlier parts of our application.  Here is some layout CSS code to make our page look like the layout:  store-locator-container{     float: left;     margin-left: 20px;     width: 875px;     font: normal 12px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;     color: 333; }  page-header{     float: left; }  form-container{     clear: left;     float: left;     margin-top: 15px;     width: 100%; }  map-container{     clear: left;     float: left;     margin-top: 27px;     height: 530px;     width: 875px; }  map-container a{     color: e76737;     text-decoration: none; }  map-container a:hover, map-container a:active{     text-decoration: underline; }  map-container .custom-marker{     width: 32px;  [ 203 ]       height: 37px;     color: fff;     background: url .. images custom-marker.png  no-repeat;     padding: 3px;     cursor: pointer; }  loc-list .list-focus{     border: 1px solid rgba 82,168,236,0.9 ;     -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba 82,168,236,0.7 ;     -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba 82,168,236,0.7 ;     box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba 82,168,236,0.7 ;     transition: border 0.2s linear 0s, box-shadow 0.2s linear 0s; }  map-container .loc-name{     color: AD2118;     font-weight: bold; }  So this completes our frontend API code. We have learned how to use Laravel 4 to  create simple APIs and how to authenticate users in API as well as how to send a  JSON response to the client.  Summary In this chapter we have learned how to build RESTful applications with Laravel 4. In  the initial part of the chapter we learned the basics of REST and then we built a store  locator's single page application.  Towards the end of this chapter, we learned how to code the RESTful backend and  frontend via Laravel 4 and jQuery. In the next chapter, we will learn how we can use  Laravel 4 to debug, optimize, and secure our applications.  [ 204 ]   Optimizing and Securing   Our Applications  In this chapter we will learn how we can optimize Laravel via the profiler and how  to secure our applications. We will also learn how to log data with Laravel as well as  how we can add security layers to our application. Here are the topics we are going  to cover in this chapter:     Handling errors with Laravel    Profiling Laravel applications    Logging data with Laravel    Security in Laravel  SQL injections        CSRF    XSS  We have learned how to create applications with Laravel 4 in prior chapters. Now,  we need to focus on small issues and details that will help us optimize Laravel  configurations. Let's start with errors.  Handling errors By default, Laravel sets the debug option in app config app.php as true, so  whenever an error occurs, Laravel shows a detailed error page. This will show all  kinds of information about the error, such as the stack trace, the filenames, and the  error line with reference to the code block. This is ideal when you are developing  your application, but showing those pages to users in production will really scare  them. So when you are in a production environment, you need to switch off the error  variable by setting it to false in your app file.   Now the question is how to track errors in production. If we turn off the debug  variable, how do we know whether there are any errors and how to handle these  errors? Returning a blank page on error occurrence will not help users, and  switching off the error will not help us debug it. Well, Laravel has an answer for that:  log files. In your logs directory at app storage , you will have a log of errors on  file for each day. So, if you want to find out what happened on your production site  yesterday, just check the log file log- .txt and you will have all the details  you want, including the error stack and any common error occurring without your  knowledge. Once you put your site into production, look for logs for a few days as  there might be bugs or errors that you don't know and that are invisible to users.  The next question is how to we handle error pages. On error occurrence, you may  want to send the user to a custom page on which they can see relevant pages or  search pages. Sometimes, you may want to send them to your sitemap. So you will  need to have control over the error pages. Guess what! You can do that easily with  Laravel error handlers.  We want to manage a situation in which a certain page is not found and the user needs  to be directed to a much more search friendly page with our sitemap. To do this you  will need to add the following entry to your global.php file placed at app start :  App::missing function $exception  {     return Response::view 'custom404page', array  , 404 ; } ;  When Laravel framework is initialized, our global.php file is scanned by the  framework for any custom error handlers. Here in our case Laravel will pick that for  any missing page   error code 4040  and will load the view file defined in our route  from app views custom404page.blade.php.  Laravel also provides an error handler that will catch any exception thrown from  your application and show the custom page or error. Here is the custom exception  handler format:  App::error function Exception $exception  {        Handle the exception... } ;  [ 206 ]   So how do we use this for something of our own? Remember we had cart exceptions  in Chapter 5, Creating a Cart Package for Our Application. Say for example we want to  show a custom error page for CartInvalidDataException to the user to tell them  that there is some problem with the cart. How do we do that? It's simple; just use  your exception in an error handler as shown in the following code snippet:  App::error function CartInvalidDataException $exception  {     Log::error $exception ;     return Response::view 'Cart.dataerror' ; } ;  Here, Laravel will pick our error handler, and whenever the error handler catches  CartInvalidDataException, it will respond with dataerror in the cart folder of  your views directory. Similarly, you can use other packages. Say for example you are  using Sentry; you can use exceptions such as UserSuspendedException to display  users who have suspended the custom page instead of the dashboard.  We have learned how to handle errors and give custom responses and handle  custom exceptions. Let's learn how to profile our application and how to find  out about what's happening on the page. In other words, we learn to find out  information such as input variables  $_GET and $_POST  and all the queries run  on the page or how much time it takes to execute a page or the amount of memory  consumed for executing a given page.  Profiling Laravel applications Profiling is measuring the software program's time or memory for a given   function class or any code block. The most common purpose of profiling  applications is to aid application optimization.  There are two very good Laravel packages that will allow you to profile   your applications:     juy profiler    loic-sharma profiler  Both are based on the Laravel 3 profiler and have almost the same features, but   juy profiler has a few more features and I use it for profiling my applications.  Here is a list of things you can track with juy profiler:     Environment information    Current controller action info    Routes  [ 207 ]      Log events    The SQL query log with syntax highlighting    Total execution time    Total memory usage    All variables passed to views    Session variables    Sentry authentication variables  Isn't this awesome? When you are developing applications, you will have all this  information right at your fingertips on each request. Thus you will instantly be able  to tell when something goes wrong even if it may not show in the page output  but  is obviously wrong in the background . This is because, you have created code that  loops queries. This profiler will let you know you are running x queries at the bottom  of the page and you would know instantly something is wrong with the page. You  can then refactor your code to fix those mistakes. Let's see how we can install and use  the profiler in our Laravel application.  To install the profiler go to your composer.json file and add following entry to the  require array:  "juy profiler" : "dev-master"  Then, run composer update so that Composer downloads the package and puts it in  the vendor's directory. Now to hook it up with our Laravel application we will need  to add its service provider into the providers array in the app.php file. Add the  following line to the code in the app.php configuration file:  'Juy\Profiler\Providers\ProfilerServiceProvider',  Also add the following alias in the alias array in the config file:  'Profiler' => 'Juy\Profiler\Facades\Profiler',  One last step is to publish the config files of the package so that our config file  doesn't get overwritten if we update the package:  $ php artisan config:publish juy profiler  Now you will have the config file available at app config packages juy  profiler . Just change the profiler option to true. And you will have a profiler  bar at the bottom of your page in your browser. The profiler will display the  information related to your page and environment in small tabs at the bottom  of your page. For example, a SQL section will contain all the queries and an  environment section will have information about which environment is loaded   and which Laravel version you are using right now.  [ 208 ]   As you can see, it gives you a lot more information, such as memory allocated by  current page and which files are used by the framework to generate this page as   well as any session variables used in the page. Here is the preview of the juy   profiler in action:  Juy Profiler for Laravel  Another very important use of the profiler is to find out the time needed to execute  any block of code in your application. Say for example you want to profile time  between blocks of code; you can write the following code and the profiler will  display the time needed to execute the code in the time tab:  Profiler::start 'Blocka started' ; DB::query 'select * from auther where id='.$id ; Profiler::end 'Blocka completed' ;  In the preceding example, we can see the time between executing two simultaneous  queries via our profiler. This is how you can optimize sections of your page by  finding which section takes more time.  [ 209 ]   Logging data with Laravel Another important aid to understanding why errors occur is the logging of  important events during page execution. Laravel provides logging methods that we  can use to save a lot of things that happened in the page. This is very useful in certain  situations, such as When you are doing beta testing and users complain that certain  pages or processes are not working; you can actually debug things via this data and  can create a test case for finding errors that the users face. This can be done using the  following code:  Log::debug 'input data at pointA is '. Input::get    ; Log::info 'User completed point x' ; Log::notice 'functionx is called' ; Log::emergency 'User was able to reach pageA without authentication' ;  You can use the preceding code at various points in your application to see what is  happening in the application as users are testing it. You can see the output of your  logging methods in app storage logs log- .txt. If you open your log file,  you can see the output for each request will look like the following code snippet:  [2013-09-20 11:47:31] log.DEBUG: input data at pointA is, array  x=>1,  y=>2   [2013-09-20 11:47:31] log.INFO: User completed point x [2013-09-20 11:47:31] log.NOTICE: functionx is called [2013-09-20 11:47:31] log.emergency: User was able to reach pageA  without authentication. array  x=>1, y=>2    You will now have information to create a case for errors or users' complaints by  asking just date and time to the user. You can find out what happened at that time  and understand things much better; this should help you optimize your application.  Security in Laravel One important aspect of managing web applications is security. There is a new security  threat looming every few days. Let's see how Laravel helps secure our application and  what things we would need to add to our application to make it secure.  Laravel's default authentication provides AES-256 encryption to passwords via a 32- bit key generated during the installation of Laravel in app config app.php. We can  also use these algorithms to encrypt things in our application. In other words, if you  want to encrypt confidential data, you can encrypt it as follows:  $encrypted = Crypt::encrypt 'secret' ;  [ 210 ]   If you want to decrypt it, you can use the decrypt function as follows:  $decrypted = Crypt::decrypt $encryptedValue ;  Similarly, Laravel has a secure hash with cookies, so if the client changes any of   the cookies set by Laravel, Laravel will stop the request and redirect the user to   an error page.  SQL injections Laravel automatically handles SQL injection vulnerabilities for us via its DB class.   It handles parameters by filtering them via prepared statements and uses PDO    PHP Data Objects . So, as a user you, wouldn't have to worry about security issues.  Remember that if you are using DB::raw, which is used for  sending raw expressions to databases, it will not be filtered by  Laravel; therefore, be careful when you are using DB::raw.  CSRF CSRF  Cross site request forgery  is a way to exploit websites using unauthorized  commands that are transmitted from a third-party website accessed by a registered  user while they are logged in to the site being targeted.  Laravel provides CSRF protection when you use the Form::Open method to open  forms. It adds a hidden token that will be checked if you have enabled the CSRF  filter for your route. Here is how you can write your route:  Route::post 'subscribe', array 'before' => 'csrf', function   {     return 'subscribed'; }  ;  If you are not using the Form::open method to handle your forms, you can still add  csrf_token via the following method:  <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="<?php echo csrf_token  ;  ?>">  The preceding code will generate a CSRF token and send it when the form is posted.  [ 211 ]   XSS  Cross site scripting  This is the one aspect that Laravel reserves for developers to decide on. XSS is always  the most typical attack and is most used by hackers to steal information in the form of  stealing a user's cookies and logging in via those cookies. The vulnerability exploited  in this type of attack is that you need to allow your users to save content in HTML  format, which is not encrypted. Hackers use the flaws in browsers or PHP or your  code to bypass some sort of JavaScript code which will be executed and steal the user's  cookies. So, the first rule you need to remember is, always filter the user's content.  If you do not intend to use any of your input for saving content in the HTML format,  use the strip_tags PHP function to remove any tags from content saved by users.  For example:  $name = strip_tags Input::get 'name'  ; $address = strip_tags Input::get 'address'  ;  This is the most basic way of protecting your application from an XSS attack. But  there are times when you need to allow users to save their content in HTML format.  In these cases, use the following code to save the content:  function encode $field  {     return htmlspecialchars $field, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8' ; } $name = encode Input::get 'name'  ;  The preceding code will convert any special characters in user content into   HTML entities. So any of the code which contains <  less than  becomes &lt   and >  greater than  becomes &gt.  Any code that can be executed via JavaScript is not executed when echoed back.  When you echo it, you will need to use the function html_entity_decode to   display the content in properly formatted HTML.  Another important thing you need to remember is that your page should have the  following meta tag within your HTML template:     This is to make sure we are not using any other type of encoding that hackers can use  to exploit security vulnerabilities.  We have learned how to manage our application's errors, optimize our application  via profiler, and secure applications in Laravel.  [ 212 ]   Summary In this chapter we have learned how to debug, profile, and secure our web  applications. We first learned how to debug errors and profile our applications.   We then learned how to log events. Finally, we learned how to secure our  applications from SQL injections, CSRF, and XSS.  In the next chapter we will learn how to deploy web applications developed   in Laravel.  [ 213 ]    Deploying Laravel  Applications  In this chapter, we will learn how to deploy Laravel applications. We will see  different methods that you can use to deploy Laravel applications. Also, we will see  the configuration changes that you might need to make on some of the popular web  hosts in order to work your application on their environment.  Imagine you have finished all your features in a project, now you want to make  it live. How can you do that? To deploy any Laravel application, you will need to  perform following steps:     Creating production configuration    Creating a directory structure based on your web host    Uploading your Laravel application directory files    Creating a database in the production site and upload your local database on   the production site     Giving proper permissions to your storage files    Setting up .htaccess based on your server   Creating production configuration Based on your web host, you may need to change your environment information  such as the mail or cache provider, as well as the database information. If you change  your local configuration files then your local application will stop working, and  assuming that you are using Git, you may sometimes swipe the configuration files  by mistake. To avoid all these problems you can use Laravel environments. You can  define which environment will use which file. Head over to your bootstrap start. php directory and change the following configuration:  $env = $app->detectEnvironment array     'local' => array 'your-machine-name' ,   'production' => array 'example.com' ,   ;  Here, we have added the production entry in our $env array. This tells Laravel to  look for the production folder in the config folder to override any configuration  entries loaded from the config directory when requests are made from example.com.  So now say for example, you want to add your database information of production  into database.php, then just create a new database.php file in the production  directory in the app config directory of your installation, and add following code   to your database.php:  return array      'connections' => array            'mysql' => array            'driver'    => 'mysql',           'host'      => 'db.example.com',           'database'  => 'myapp',           'username'  => 'myappuser',           'password'  => 'myapppassword',           'charset'   => 'utf8',           'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',           'prefix'    => '',          ,        ;  Now as our configuration is set up in the bootstrap file, Laravel will load the  database connection from the production directory's database.php. Laravel will  load other configurations from default files automatically. It will just override the  ones you write in your configuration file.  [ 216 ]   So this is how you can have all your production settings as well as local settings in  one place and without any conflicts.  Creating a directory structure based on  your web host There are times when you want to change the directory structure of Laravel before  uploading it on the server, just as you have multiple sites on a server and you don't  want to change the document root of your server to the Laravel's public directory as it  will mean all other sites' roots will also change. Or when your shared server-hosting  provider doesn't allow you to change the document root of your site. Then your best  bet is to change the directory structure of your Laravel application before deploying it  to meet the server's directory structure.  In order to do that, you would need to assume that your public_html or www folder  from the web host is the public directory of your Laravel installation. So your public  folder is uploaded to your public_html directory. What about other files? Well, you  can create a directory named Laravel and put all files and directories there except  the public directory which you will upload on the public_html directory. Now  change the index.php file of your public directory to match the new path; that is, it  would be .. Laravel   and upload your Laravel directory in the  parent directory of the public_html folder.  Uploading your Laravel application  directory files How do you upload your Laravel application files? Well, it depends on which   type of web host you have and whether or not it provides you with the SSH access.  Most of the shared hosts don't provide you with the SSH access or you have to file a  ticket and verify yourself for that. Ask your web host support team if they provide  SSH or not.  So there are two ways you can upload your Laravel application and they are:     Via SSH    Via FTP  [ 217 ]   Deploying via SSH Secure Shell  SSH  is a protocol to secure data communication. If your web host  permits SSH, then it will have an SSH server installed on the server. The SSH server  allows you to open remote terminal connections which allow us to transfer files  or run commands on the server. To connect with the SSH server, you will need to  have an SSH client. SSH requires a client to use the SSH protocol to connect with the  server and allow you to run commands.  There are different SSH clients available based on your operating system.  If you are on Windows operating system, you would need to use the following clients:     Putty: http:  www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ~sgtatham putty   download.html     Cygwin: http:  www.cygwin.com install.html  If you are on Linux or Mac operating system, you don't need to install anything as  both OS come with the OpenSSH client which allows us to use SSH.  Uploading files via OpenSSH  Linux, Mac  Let's see how we can connect to a server via the OpenSSH client. In OpenSSH, you  can connect with the remote server via the following command:  $ssh username@servername –p port  So for example, your site name is example.com and your user account is James, then  you can log in to your server via following command:  $ssh james@example.com  Some shared web hosts don't allow the use of username and password to connect with  your server. They restrict the SSH access based on SSH key files. Basically it works like  how you would set up your SSH key via your web host admin panel  for example,  cPanel . Via its key generator, you will generate a private key. The generator will  give you a private SSH key, which can be matched with the public SSH key used by  the server to authenticate your SSH session requests. This way there is no password  involved and the security is maintained between two endpoints. Remember, you need  to save your SSH keys in the .ssh directory located at  home user .  Now copy your Laravel directory, remove the vendors' directory, and compress the  copied directory and use the following command to send your compressed directory  to your web server:  $scp myapp.tar james@example.com: home var www myapp.tar  [ 218 ]   The preceding command will send myapp.tar from your system to the user's   www directory which is an apache directory. Run the composer to install it via   SSHs in the application directory of your server.  Uploading files via Putty  Windows  If you are using Windows, then you would need to use the Putty SSH client for  Windows. It doesn't operate the same way as the OpenSSH client. It has a graphical  interface where you would need to fill the hostname  example.com , connection  type ssh , and then click on Open and it will load the command window connected  with the SSH server and prompt you for your password.  Once you are logged in SSH to transfer your files, you would need to use the   pscp.exe file which will be available on the Putty site from where you downloaded  the Putty client. Once you have pscp.exe where you have Putty, you can then run  the following command from the Putty window:  $pscp myapp.tar james@example.com: var www   The preceding command will transfer your files from your directory to your web  server's root directory.  Creating a database in the production  site and uploading your local database  on the production site To upload your database, you would need to create a database in your web server.  For shared hosts, there will be database options in your web panel  cPanel  where  you can create your database and database user. For Virtual Private Server  VPS  or  dedicated servers, you can create a new database and upload it by either installing  phpMyAdmin or Adminer or directly MySQL command line if you are good with  MySQL commands.  Now if you have the command line access to your server, you can use Laravel's  artisan to import your database via the following command:  $ php artisan migrate  If you don't have access to command line, you will need to upload the database from  your local copy of the database. Go to your phpMyAdmin or Adminer URL address  and click on your database. Then, click on import and choose the database file you  have from your local database. Once you click on Upload, your database is ready.  [ 219 ]   Giving proper permissions to your  storage files We also need to set correct permissions for storage files in the server. So, we need to  give a write permission in the storage directory as follows:  $ chmod –R  777  var laravel app storage  The preceding command will change the storage directories permission to 777  recursively, so all files and directories will be writable for Laravel. Also, you will  need to set a permission for any of your image upload folders in the public directory  in the same way.  If your host doesn't allow permissions via command line, then you can use your web  admin panel's file manager to change permissions.  Setting up .htaccess based on your  server Laravel does come with default .htaccess in your public folder which removes  index.php from the URLs but different server configurations have different values.  So if your server doesn't work with the default .htaccess, here is the .htaccess  configuration you can try:  Options +FollowSymLinks RewriteEngine On  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]  If you are using hostgator as your server, then you would need to add the following  line in your .htaccess file:  AddType application x-httpd-php53 .php  This allows you to run your site in PHP 5.3, as by default sites will run in the older  version of PHP as Laravel requires minimum PHP 5.3 Version. Similarly, if you are  using Site5 as your web hosting provider, you need to add the following line to your  .htaccess file:  AddHandler application x-httpd-php53 .php  [ 220 ]   So check for the correct version of your PHP if your Laravel application is not  working when you deploy it to live. You will find similar instruction at your web  host support documents which will have exact syntax to enable PHP 5.3+ Versions.  Deploying via FTP If you want to deploy via File Transfer Protocol  FTP , you can do that simply by  using the FTP client. Your web host will provide you with the hostname, username,  and password which you can use to connect with your web server via FTP clients  such as FileZilla. Once you are connected with your FTP program, you can simply  transfer files from your local application directory to your remote directory such as  www or public_html.  But the previous methods have a huge problem when you want to update the site.  You would have to manually remember all file names and upload them by going to  the particular folders where the file resides. There is a chance that you will forget one  of the files one day and it may have a strange effect on your web application. The  best way to deploy Laravel and update consistently in production is using Git.  Deploying via SSH from the Git repository Git is a version management system and as you change your files it manages its  version. The best part about it is that we can use Git to deploy the changed files from  our local Git repository to the remote Git repository and Git automatically manages  that process when we push our code to the remote Git repository.  You might be wondering how do we get our files from a Git repository? Well you  can add post-receive hook which will run every time the Git repository is updated.  So here is how you can do this.  First, you will need to have an SSH access in your server. Second, check if you have  Git installed in your server. If it is not installed, then install it. Now create a directory  under your  var directory.  $ sudo mkdir  var git  Give permission to the apache user www to access the folder.  $ sudo chown -R :www  var git  $ sudo chmod +s -R  var git  [ 221 ]   Now we need to create a remote repository which will be updated by our local   Git repository. To maintain the integrity of repository, we will make it a bare  repository; that is, only the Git folders will be maintained. Files will not be   shown in the Git directory.  $ mkdir  var git example.git  $ cd  var git example.git  $ git init --bare  Now we need to add a post-receive hook which will pick the change in our bare  repository we just created and put the files in the site's \var\www folder.  So let's just add the post-receive hook by first creating a hook.  $ vim  var git appname hooks post-receive  And then add the following code to hook:  ! bin sh GIT_WORK_TREE= var www  git checkout -f  Also we need to make a Git hook executable so it can be executed via the   following command:   $ chmod +x  var git example.git hooks post-receive  Now at our local Git repository, we need to add this remote repository via the  following command:  $ git remote add myserver ssh:  James@example.com: var git appname.git  Now whenever you want to update your code in the production environment, run  the following code:  $ git push myserver master  Deploying via FTP from the Git repository If you have only the FTP access and you want to use Git to update your site, then  you have to use a deployment package. One such package is Dandelion. To install  Dandelion, you will need to have Ruby and RubyGems installed in your local  system. Once you have installed Ruby and RubyGems, you can run the following  command to get Dandelion:  $ gem install dandelion  [ 222 ]   Once you have Dandelion installed, you can deploy your updated Git files via the  following command:  $ dandelion deploy  Hey, but where do we add our FTP username and password? Well, Dandelion  searches the root of your Git repository for the configuration file named   dandelion.yml which will contain the configuration to deploy the files to FTP.  So create dandelion.yml and update it with following values:  scheme: ftp host: example.com username: testuser password: testpassword   Optional  --------   Remote path path:  var www   exclude:     - .gitignore     - dandelion.yml     - tests    These files  from your working directory  will be uploaded on every  deploy additional:     - public css print.css     - public css screen.css     - public js main.js  As you can see, it's a very simple configuration file with following options:     Scheme: It would be either FTP or SFTP or Amazon S3    Path: The path variable is used to denote where files will be uploaded in the   production environment when you run Dandelion to deploy it     Exclude: These files or folders will not be uploaded when you run the    deploy command     Additional: These files or folders will be uploaded on each deploy command  So that's how simple it is to use Dandelion to upload your files on a server via FTP.  [ 223 ]   Summary In this chapter, we have learned how to deploy your web applications. We have seen  two different techniques SSH and FTP to deploy your applications. We also looked  at how Git could be used to automatically deploy applications via SSH and FTP.  Also we learned the configuration needed to deploy things such as database and  production related configurations.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create workflow with some awesome  Laravel packages and tools.  [ 224 ]   Creating a Workflow   and Useful Laravel   Packages and Tools  This chapter will describe some of the useful packages that can be used to create web  applications rapidly in Laravel. This chapter will also give you some tips on tools  and workflow which will make your life easy as a developer.  I think every developer spends almost an entire day writing code on their code  editor, for the most part of their life. As developers, we should know editors better  and learn tips and tricks to save our time, such as installing the add-ons, plugins, or  packages it provides. For example, Notepad++ provides a Compare plugin, which  allows you to compare two files and shows the differences between those files. Now  this feature might not be great unless you have two files—one, the backup file and  the other, the current file. If you have added code that has stopped working and  needs to be fixed, you can use this plugin to see what you actually changed in the  code.  I know Git provides this, but at times, we have to deal with a file that doesn't  have Git.  That's the reason you should know your editor better; those little features  make your life easy and the time spent on learning the editor will help you through  life, saving time and making your tasks easier every time.  As web developers, there are some aspects that are crucial in our day-to-day lives.  The following are a few aspects:     Debugging an application    Command-line tools    Version management via Git or SVN    Testing tools    Reusing code, components, or packages   Creating a workflow From all the aspects described in the previous section, it would be great if the web  developer's editor could do even a few from the editor window itself. So, that way,  the developer doesn't have to constantly switch between windows and run tasks  from other applications. As a developer, I prefer to use the Sublime text editor as it manages almost four of  the aspects we have previously mentioned. I have used a lot of editors until now  and the list includes editors such as Notepad++, Dreamweaver, Komodo IDE, and  NetBeans, all powerful editors with a lot of features and functionalities. If you are  using them—great—and if you are still using Notepad or other editors, I would  suggest using Sublime or any of the editors previously listed.  Now, in the scope of this chapter, I am going to cover the Sublime text editor, as I  find that it's the only editor that can manage so many of the development aspects  that I need to use in daily life.  I like the Sublime text editor because the first thing I noticed was that it's fast!  Superfast, compared to other editors I have used. Looking for files is just Ctrl + P away   command + P on Mac . It lists all files via its fuzzy search and it's been almost accurate  every time I have used it. It really helps when you are developing applications for  which you don't want to use your mouse or need to open a sidebar tree, such as view,  to find the file. Another important aspect of the Sublime editor is Package Control. Package Control  is the Sublime Text 2 package manager. It allows you to add the package's features.  To install it, you need to run the python code on the console window of the Sublime  editor. Let's install Package Control.  Visit https:  sublime.wbond.net installationst2 and copy the Sublime  Text 2 code displayed on the tab window. Now, in your editor, click on the view  menu and select the Show Console option, which will open the console window  in Sublime Text 2. Just paste the code copied from the site, press Enter, and restart  the editor. To see whether or not Package Control is installed, press Ctrl + Shift+ P   command + Shift + P on Mac  and input install package. If you can see the name  appear while you are typing, you have Package Control installed.  Package manager allows us to install packages created by the developer community.  We will see some really good packages that provide the development aspects that we  discussed in the first section of the chapter.  [ 226 ]   Now, to debug PHP applications within our editor, we can install the XDebug client  Sublime Text 2 package. To install this package, press Ctrl + Shift+ P  command +   Shift + P on Mac  and execute install package. This will fetch Sublime packages  and display them in a list format; now search for the XDebug client and install it.  To use the XDebug client, we need to have XDebug installed in our installed server.  If you are using XAMPP or WAMP in your local development environment, you  might have the the XDebug extension installed within your application. To check  whether or not XDebug is installed, you can run the phpinfo   function with the   test PHP page and it will display all the extensions installed in the web server  and check if its installed. If it's not installed, the guide to install it can be found at  http:  xdebug.org docs install.  You need to configure the XDebug package configuration file to debug the application.  I would recommend using the Sublime project setting file to set the configuration as it  gives you control to configure settings based on the project, which is useful as you will  have different URLs for each project. Now create a projectname.sublime project file  at the root of your folder and insert the following code:  {     "folders":     [         {             "path": "D: projects exampleproject"         }     ],     "settings":     {         "XDebug": {             "path_mapping": {                              },             "ide_key": "sublime.XDebug",             "url": "http:  projectname.local",             "port": 9000,             "close_on_stop": true,             "max_depth": 3,             "max_children": 32,             "debug": true         }     } }  [ 227 ]   You need to input the URL of the local project that you want to debug in the  projectname.sublime file, and the absolute path of your local directory in the  folders array path configuration.  Now check your php.ini file and make sure XDebug.remote_enable is set to on or  1. Then add a breakpoint within your code file from where you would like to debug  via Ctrl + Shift + F9. Now open your project in the browser with the following URL:  http:  projectname.local?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1  Now if you switch back to your editor, you will see the debug window opened   at the bottom with all the page variables and you can debug your code using the  following shortcuts:     Run: Ctrl + Shift + F5    Step Over: Ctrl + Shift + F6    Step Into: Ctrl + Shift + F7    Step Out: Ctrl + Shift + F8    Stop    Detach  To stop the debugging process, press Ctrl + Shift + P and type XDebug; it will display  the option to stop debugging or detach debugging. So this is how Sublime Text 2  helps you debug your application. The first aspect in our list is covered by Sublime  Text 2. Let's see how other packages can help us.  Another package I really like is Git. This sublime package allows us to run Git  commands in our editor, so we don't have to switch between our command window  and editor. As web developers, we constantly have to work with the browser and  editor, so adding the command window to that list is not a great option; so, we can  use the Sublime Git to manage Git commands from the Sublime console. To install the Sublime Git package, open the Sublime command window via Ctrl  + Shift + P and select Git from the list. Restart the editor and you will have the Git  package installed. To verify it, open the command window via Ctrl + Shift + P and  type git; you will have all the Git commands arranged in a handy list  no need to  remember them  and pretty good options to view the logfiles too.  Now say, for example, you want to create a Git repository; just open the command  palate via Ctrl + Shift + P, type git init, and select the option. Your Git repository  will be initialized. Generally, to do this you would have to open the command  window and change the path to your project directory, then type git init.  Compared to our workflow, it's less work; as you can see, you just have to type the  git init command two times and you are done—no need to switch windows.  [ 228 ]   Another useful application of the Git package is when you are in an individual file  and you want to see how that file looked in a specific commit. In such cases, you  can type in git log all and it will display all the commits in a list. You can then  select the commit number and it will display what it looked like and what has been  changed between the current commit and the selected commit. Isn't that awesome?  So we have covered another aspect of our Git development. There are tons of  packages for Sublime Text 2 that you can install. To search for packages, go to  https:  sublime.wbond.net  and view information about plugins. You can find  plugins for adding snippets, changing the color scheme, or highlighting syntax for  blade view files. I would recommend that you check out the following packages:     Emmet: This helps you develop the HTML code faster via snippets.    phpcs: This is the PHP Linter; that is, it checks for PHP syntax errors. It also   adds functionalities such as coding the standard fixer and mess detector.     Livereload: This reloads the project tab in the browser when you save   the file, that is, there's no need to refresh the browser manually to test the  application in it.  So we have learned a lot about the Sublime text editor and how we can use it to  manage our workflow. Let's see some of the packages that really help us generate  code via Laravel's artisan command-line tool.  Introducing JeffreyWay Laravel-4-Generators The first package I would like to introduce is Laravel-4-Generators. This package is  really helpful when you are starting your application and want to build a prototype  rapidly. It generates all types of CRUD  CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE   boilerplate code, which we would otherwise have to write.  Let's install this package and see its usage in detail. To install the package,   open up your composer.json file in the editor and add the following lines   in the require array:  "require": {     "laravel framework": "4.0.*",     "way generators": "dev-master" },  "minimum-stability" : "dev"  [ 229 ]   Run the composer update command so that Composer will download the   package and update its files in the vendor directory. To integrate the package   with Laravel, open up the app.php file from the config folder and add the   service provider as follows:  'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider'  Once you have added the service provider, the package will have added   generate commands in the Laravel artisan commands. To see those commands,  run php artisan and you will be able to see the new generator commands. Let's  learn some of the important generators.  We can generate migration with fields via the migration generator provided in the  generator package. So in just one line, you can generate your database tables using  fields. So say, for example, you want to create an authors table with name, age, and  ISBN number fields. You can do that by running the following command from the  root of your project:  $ php artisan generate:migration create_authors_table  --fields="name:string, city:string, isbn_number: string"  $ php artisan migrate  The preceding command will create the authors table migration file in   app database migrations  and then run the migrate command so the   authors table will be created. Think about the convenience to this. You don't   have to open your database editor, select the database, and add your fields.   You just have to run one command and your database table is ready; that's   the power of Laravel's artisan and generator package.  You can generate different types of files with structure via the generator package.  Let's generate a model for our authors table using the following command:  $ php artisan generate:model Author  The preceding command will generate a model file in app model author.php with  the following code:  <?php  }  class Author extends Eloquent {  [ 230 ]   You can use the model anywhere in your code; you don't need to change anything.  Isn't that great? One command, and we don't have to write boilerplate code or create  files and worry about structure. Similarly, just as we generated a model, you can  generate the Controller, view, and database seeds.  Another generator feature is scaffolding. You can generate a CRUD code for your  table without writing a single line of code. To generate a scaffold for our author's  table, we can use the following command:  $ php artisan generate:scaffold Author --fields="name:string,  age:integer, city:string, isbn_number:string"  The preceding command will generate a model, a resourceful Controller, view files,  the migration file, the seed file, and the route declaration of our author's resource. All  the code is actually generated within the files, so if you browse your application by  going to http:  test.local authors, you will be able to access the interface that  lists all the authors and, via that, the interface on which you can add edit delete  authors. You can use this as a prototype when building an application rapidly.  Another awesome generator command is the forms generator. Forms generator  accepts the model name as an argument and generates a form based on your fields.  So, for example, if we need to generate our authors table, the command is:  $ php artisan generate:form Author  The preceding command will generate the following form:  {{ Form::open array 'route' => 'author.store'   }}                             {{ Form::label 'name', 'Name:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'name'  }}                                       {{ Form::label 'age', 'Age:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'age'  }}                           {{ Form::label 'city', 'City:'  }}             {{ Form::text 'city'  }}                           {{ Form::label 'isbn_number', 'Isbn Number:'  }}             [ 231 ]               {{ Form::text 'isbn_number'  }}                                  {{ Form::submit   }}                 {{ Form::close   }}  You can use this form in your view files directly.  Just like the generators, there are many other packages that you can use to quickly  build prototypes. The following are some of the awesome packages that you can use  to quick start your project:         Ardent: Self-validating models for Laravel 4  https:  github.com   laravelbook ardent  Intervention: The image manipulation package for Laravel 4  http:   intervention.olivervogel.net image getting_started laravel     Laravel 4 - Starter Kit: More of a rapid prototype application that uses   different Laravel packages with prebuilt features such as backend, frontend,  and authentication  https:  github.com brunogaspar laravel4- starter-kit   Summary In this chapter, we have learned how the workflow can save our development time.  We learned how to utilize editor and Laravel packages to save time.  So, we have come a long way. Hope you have enjoyed the journey!
