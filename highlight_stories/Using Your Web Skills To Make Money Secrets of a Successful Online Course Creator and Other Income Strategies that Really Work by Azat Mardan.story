If I can sum up those strategies in one sentence, it would be: helping  people by sharing an expertise that you possess or acquire during the  process of teaching.  The goal of this book is to tell you what worked and what didn’t for me,   giving you the best tools and inspiration. I hope they’ll help you achieve  your monetary, career, creative, or contributorship goals.  vii   CHAPTER 1  Live Training  Live training is the fastest way to deliver your message. There are three  sub-types of delivering live trainings:     Online: All students online, and the content is delivered   via video conference webinar.          In person: Everyone is at the same location, and the  content is delivered via projector and whiteboard.  In person with online broadcasting: Same as in-person  training with the addition of an online audience, which  is typically limited to listen-only, i.e., no interactions or  questions allowed from the online audience.  I love live trainings. They require less preparation, because you will be  there to handle most of the concerns and questions in the moment. I used  live in-person trainings as a prequel to my books and online courses.  Here are some other benefits of doing live trainings:     You will immediately know if your ideas are good.     You’ll know if the pricing was right.     You’ll find out what is missing in your slides, manuals   and examples, and what is causing confusion.    Azat Mardan 2018  A. Mardan, Using Your Web Skills To Make Money,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3922-3_1  1   Chapter 1    Live training     You’ll know the frequently asked questions so you can   include those topics in the material.     You’ll get almost the undivided attention of your  students, which is harder to get with a book or an  online course.     You’ll network with people.     You’ll establish yourself as a trainer and public speaker.     You’ll get a chance to use this training to contact other   speakers and companies to invite them as guests to  sponsor your event.     You’ll make money almost right away.     You’ll prepare for making a scalable product such as an   online course.  Of course, your training doesn’t have to be in-person only. It’s more   scalable, meaning you can reach more people and sell more tickets if  you broadcast your training online via Google on Air, GotoWebinar, or  a similar service. However, if this the first time you’re organizing such  an event, I recommend that you focus only on in-person training. This  will save you the hassle of finding cameras, setting up the broadcast, and  manning the online chat  all while teaching the class .  If you feel confident that you have the capacity to do both online and   in-person at the same time, then more power to you. I see this model being  used more and more often. Typically the online version is priced lower  than the in-person one.  2   Chapter 1    Live training   Getting Started To get started with your first live training, you need to have these things  figured out:     Topic and title: A niche and area of your training. Come   up with something catchy by using proven headlines1.     Description: A short 3-5 sentence description of your   training.     Curriculum: A detailed list of topics you plan to   cover  word them as benefits to your students, not as  features .     Prerequisites: A list of skills knowledge that students   must have prior to taking your class.     Requirements: A list of items students need to have,  install, or bring, such as a laptop with Git and NPM.     Location: An address and directions to the training site.     Price: The price of the events. You can research similar  courses offered by General Assembly and price lower  or higher depending on the discrepancy between your  curriculum and theirs.     Discounts: Your discount strategy. Are you going to offer   early bird discounts? What about group discounts?     Date: The big day. Set the date of the event. Weekends  or weeknights work best, because students won’t need  to take a day off from work.  1 http:  www.copyblogger.com 10-sure-fire-headline-formulas-that-work  3   Chapter 1    Live training     Slides: Slides that you’ll use to cover the topics; they   don’t have to be detailed.     Manuals  optional : A manual that students can use to  follow your slides or brush up at home. I recommend  creating ∼50-page manual in a PDF or paperback  format. The more details this manual has the better.  You can also create it in a workbook format with spaces  left to fill in the answers to questions, take notes, and  do exercises.     Examples  optional : Examples or case studies. For  technical training, the more examples you have, the  more things students can take with them and apply  to their projects later, which means the value of  your training increases. Case studies serve as a great  motivator for business courses.     Exercises  optional : Hands-on exercises that students  can perform using the knowledge from the class. For  technical training, don’t just talk, let people do some  hands-on exercises.     Snacks and lunch  optional : Will power depletes with  time. Food is a way to keep our brain working. Students  will appreciate the convenience if you provide them  with snacks, water, coffee, and a lunch; the latter will  give them time to share the learned skills that reinforce  your teaching.  Okay, so you got all  or most  of the items figured out. If not, no   worries. You can change pretty much anything later  maybe anything  except the price .  4   Chapter 1    Live training   Pricing Pricing right is an art, not a science. In addition, price changes are tricky.  If you lower the price after making a few sales at a higher price, you risk  making people who paid the higher price mad. Therefore, if you are not  sure about the price in the beginning, start with a lower price and increase  it as warranted. In other words, start lower and experiment. If you start  high and then lower the price, you might need to refund the early tickets or  offer them some bonuses.  At some point, you should be able to find the right price that will be  high enough yet allow you to sell all the tickets. Pricing is more of an art  than a science. Experiment with your audience and marketing message   sales copy .  I priced my Node Program event at a premium. The ticket cost was  $997 for a two-day event.  We had a follow-up session a week later, so it  actually was more than two days.  I did so because I wanted to keep the  event private. I limited the number of students that could register for a  single event to 10.  My reasoning: By keeping at a small size, I could spend more time with   each student to deliver the best value. I’ve seen that my delivery suffers if  the class goes beyond 15-20 people, and I’m in the classroom by myself. I’m not saying this is the best approach. It worked for me, but might  not work for others. The format of the training was the workshop format.  In workshops, students perform a lot of hands-on exercises, which is  usually accompanied by some troubles with their setups, systems, code,  computers, etc. Therefore, you need to be able to help them or have  additional staff.  Now if you think like a business—and your training should be treated  like a business venture—you can invite an assistant or offer a discounted  ticket for a teaching assistant  TA  role. In this case, you can safely  increase the number of students in your class without compromising the  effectiveness.  5   Chapter 1    Live training  To summarize, the class size depends on these factors:     Type of training: Hands-on workshops tend to require   more assistance than lectures.     How good your materials are: If your instructions    manual, slides, and talk  are clear and concise, then  your students will need less assistance. This tends to  improve with each training you do  if you update your  materials, of course .     How good the application process was: Did you filter   out complete beginners if your class was aimed at  professionals?     How good the description and prerequisites were: If you   sent your students materials to complete before the  class, did they read them and do everything you said?  To circle back to the pricing, I’ve seen prices on the higher end for   technical classes compared to non-technical classes.  Here are some examples  rounded :     Sales 101 by GA  General Assembly : $40 for two hours     Hacks for Getting Hired by GA: $35 for two hours      Intro to Python by GA: $200 for three hours     Speed-reading class: $300 for half a day     Basics of handgun safety: $150 for a day      Intro to Node by GA: $1,000 for two days     Hypnosis training: $1,500 for one week  full-time      Yoga teacher training: $3,000 for one month  full-time   6   Chapter 1    Live training     Web dev immersive by GA: $11,500 for three months    full-time      Hack Reactor: $17,000 for three months  full-time   Clearly, the more value students perceive from the training, the higher  the price tag can be. Competition is another factor. For in-person trainings,  location contributes to the demand  some topics won’t be interesting to a  lot of people in certain small areas .   Refund or No Refund Should you have a refund policy or not? They both have their pros and cons.  Refunds make it easier for people to buy in, especially if it’s not   expensive and they don’t know you yet  no trust has been established .  In other words, refunds make impulsive purchasing easier. I offer 100%  refund for my books and online courses.  Do you always want to offer refunds? Probably not. I didn’t want   impulse buyers at my Node Program live events. I wanted only committed  people.  Also, studies show that when buyers don’t have a refund option  a way  out , then they are more satisfied with their purchases. I noticed this in my  own behavior. When I buy something and they offer refunds, I always have  this thought in the back of my mind: Should I return and get something  else that might be even better? When I don’t have refund options, I am a  happier camper.  Saying all that, in my policy and description, I stated that tickets are  non-refundable, but internally, I decided that I’d offer refunds anyway to  someone really unhappy with the training. I’ll let it be an exception to the  policy. I just don’t advertise this fact broadly for the other attendees, to  avoid reducing their satisfaction.  In either case, make a price and refund decision, and know why you   made it. Experiment with these decisions for the next event.  7   Chapter 1    Live training   Getting the Space We’ve covered a lot of different topics so far. I hope they’ve been useful. But  before we proceed, let me tell you why I started doing live events.  In 2014, I left my full-time job to focus on spreading and evangelizing   Node.js. I was working on Practical Node.js2 and Pro Express.js3, but  I wanted to get to know my readers and people eager to learn Node. js directly face-to-face, because I wasn’t getting as much feedback as I  wanted from my blog and Amazon.com reviews. Long story short, I picked  a name and domain Node Program.com4 and wrote a description and  curriculum for a two-day training.  To get the space, I contacted Hack Reactor5 and they offered me a free  conference room in exchange for me putting their logo on the event page   as a partner, i.e., cross promotion .  Later, I contacted MakerSquare6 and Wix Lounge7, and they were open  to hosting my event as well. So before you rent some space at a coworking  space or a hotel, I suggest you contact these types of companies to get the  space for free:     Business incubators accelerators, e.g. 500 Startups     Small startups, e.g. Storify     Coding schools, e.g. Hack Reactor  2 http:  practicalnodebook.com 3 http:  proexpressjs.com 4 http:  nodeprogram.com 5 http:  www.hackreactor.com 6 http:  www.makersquare.com 7 http:  www.wix.com lounge san-francisco  8   Chapter 1    Live training     Continuing education schools, e.g. General Assembly8     Big companies that want to promote tech, e.g. Capital   One 360 Cafe9 and Wix Lounge  If everything else fails, you can find a coworking space and book their  conference room for a few hundred dollars, which will be paid with a few  sold tickets if you price the topic right.  I recommend giving yourself at least one month lead time before   the event, because you’ll need to prepare your slides, market the event,  print handouts manuals, and do other things. I give myself two months’  lead time. This way I can experiment with ticket prices and different  marketing tactics.   Sales Page So let’s say you have the date, location, and curriculum. You don’t need all  the slides, manuals, and examples just yet. You can finish them later. You  need the event sales page. The easiest way, and the one I used, is to sign  up for Eventbrite. You can create your event page in 30 minutes, and they  process your payments as well. You can link your PayPal  my choice  or  your bank account and start collecting the dough.  Eventbrite10 offers many settings for the events. Don’t worry about all  the settings such as affiliates, discounts, and recurring dates, if you are not  sure about them.  The most important thing is to paste your description and other   training related info and create a ticket. You’ll get the URL that you can  share with your email list, on social media, and use in ads.  8 https:  generalassemb.ly 9 http:  cafes.capitalone360.com 10 https:  www.eventbrite.com  9   Chapter 1    Live training   Marketing The best way to promote your live training is to notify your existing  customers. These are the people who already paid for some of your  products even if it was just $1. How much they paid doesn’t matter as long  as they paid something.  The logic behind this is that the freeloaders don’t count as much,   because when money exchanges hands, it creates a special relationship  between you and other people. So nurture your existing customers,  because marketing to them is the easiest way to sell this type of event    i.e., upsell .  The second best thing to existing customers, in terms of selling, is your   followers audience. Those are the people who gave you their emails in  exchange for some great content that you’ve been sending them. It can  also be a Like on Facebook or a Follow on Twitter. If you don’t have the  list yet, now is the best time for you to start creating it. You can write great  content, offer giveaways, and use lead magnets  some bonus content like a  course or an ebook .  When you blast email to your list, make sure to highlight the benefits   students will get instead of just the topics. For example, don’t write first  that they’ll learn Git.  Git is a tool developers use to save their code and  share it with other team members.  Instead, write that “you’ll become a  better team member by contributing to team’s projects via Git”. Or, “you’ll  be confident in pushing code and most likely become a go-to expert on  your team if anyone has a merge issue with Git”.  10   Chapter 1    Live training  Eventually, you can create a separate landing page  e.g., NodeProgram.  com11  and use that instead of the Eventbrite page  eventbrite.com  nodeprogram12 . The benefits of a separate landing page are many:     You have the control over layout and theme and can   experiment with it to improve conversion.     You build your own brand.     You can have an opt-in form.     You can offer other downloads or purchases.  However, having a landing page is not required. If creating a new   website sounds too time consuming, skip it for now.  The first version of  Node Program took me a few hours to put together—I can justify the time  spent.  You can direct all the traffic to the Eventbrite page because a lot of  people are familiar with the service, have accounts there, and trust it. For  these reasons, I wouldn’t use PayPal or Gumroad as an event sales page.  Sharing on social media is easy. Just don’t forget to become a valuable   member of a group first, before pitching any of your events or products.  Follow the Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook13 principle; that is, make three valuable  contributions before asking for something.  Last, but not least, you should run Facebook and Twitter ads  and   maybe on some other platform something after 2015 . The general rule is,  if your products are $1-50, send traffic to the sales page. If they are $50-500,  then create a webinar. Don’t sell from the page.  If your product tiers products are $500+, your best bet is to call each   prospect. You can offer the sales call as a consultation and make the  prospects call you. This way, they feel in control and are more likely to buy.  11 http:  nodeprogram.com 12 http:  eventbrite.com nodeprogram 13 http:  amzn.to 1bjY6Et  11   Chapter 1    Live training  The numbers might vary, but you get the idea. The closer your price is  to $1,000, the more effort you need to convert cold leads  people who are  not your existing customers .  The most important issue is to have an opportunity to follow up with  people, because with the higher price point, most of them won’t make a  decision right away. Sadly, this is true even if this is something prospects  need and want.  Therefore, direct your ad traffic to the opt-in page with a lead magnet,   not just the sales page.  My personal experience with Node Program ads supports this. I got   dismal results when I was promoting my live training. The ads were driving  traffic to the sales page. I got almost 0 sales. But I got good results with  ads when I was promoting a Sublime Text giveaway sweepstake.  By the  way, that giveaway brought over 42,000 subscribers to my blog.  I used  the KingSumo WordPress plugin to create the landing page in under 30  minutes  see Figure 1-1 . Famous author and blogger Tim Ferriss recently  used the same plugin for his giveaway14.  14 http:  kingsumo.com giveaways win-a-trip-to-space-basically  12   Chapter 1    Live training  Figure 1-1.  The Sublime Text giveaway landing page created with  the KingSumo Giveaway plugin  One more note about marketing—you can partner with a newsletter or  some local organization that has an existing list in your niche. The easiest  way to incentivize a partner is to use an affiliate link from Eventbrite.   I partnered with Startup Monthly and got good results. They blasted the  link to their members who reside in the Bay Area.  After you sell a few tickets to your events, you can focus on slides and   other material, because now you have the confidence that people need  your event.  13   Chapter 1    Live training  If you haven’t sold anything—well, this is a good thing, because you   probably didn’t invest a lot of time and effort into the preparation. Right? I  am a huge fan of the Lean Startup approach15.  You can switch to a new topic! Experiment with other techniques… or   abandon this particular topic altogether.   The Event A few tips about the event itself:     Print manuals: Not everyone is a listener; some people   learn better by reading or writing; and most people  prefer tangible things to than digital ones.  I’m not one  of them. If you ask me, I’d pick a soft copy.      Have materials on USB sticks: Same argument as above,   plus there might not be not be a fast enough Internet  connection at the classroom to download big files.     Offer certificates for completion: Some people like the   sense of achievement.     Email a few days before the event to remind everyone:   Not all may remember or have it in their calendars.     Offer your cell phone number and or get their cell   phone numbers: Someone typically will have a problem  finding the classroom.  During the event, make sure you go over the expected material. You   must underpromise and overdeliver, not the other way around. This might  sound obvious, but I think it’s worth repeating because it’s the key to success.  15 http:  theleanstartup.com  14   Chapter 1    Live training   After the Event For this reason, after you run your event, send students some bonus that  you didn’t mention. This can be a follow-up session  online or in-person   or some material like cheat sheets or notes.  We cannot teach people anything; we can only help them discover it  within themselves. — galileo galilei  In addition, ask for anonymous feedback, so you can improve the   delivery and materials. While you’re at it, ask for testimonials. Don’t be shy.  You can use testimonials on your sales page.  Get some rest and review your materials. Probably, you’ve discovered   that your slides, handouts, manual, examples, and exercises need some  polishing. Iteration must be the main focus of the first few training  sessions.  After all improvements are complete, and when you become   somewhat confident in your delivery, you can broadcast your training  online and or record it to make an online course. That’s exactly what I did  with my first online course, Node Program  see Figure 1-2 .  15   Chapter 1    Live training  Figure 1-2.  Node Program has become one of the most popular  courses on Udemy in its category  In-person training is a great way to get started on the path to earning   extra income, establishing your expertise in a certain area, and making  your content better and better.  The downside of the live in-person training is that you can only invite   so many people. It’s good if you live in a big metropolitan area such as  the Bay Area, New York, or Chicago, because most people won’t consider  flying for the training. I had a few exceptions with the Node Program.  People flew from Florida, Australia, and Washington D.C., but those were  exceptions. If you want to expand your reach, you have to broadcast the  training online.  16   Chapter 1    Live training  With the location barrier to attend eliminated, the only excuse for   students who won’t attend your live online training is that they are  busy during that time. You might guess where this leads us. That’s right,  recorded videos are covered next. Another benefit of recorded videos and  online courses  which are typically recorded videos but they don’t have to  be  is that more advanced students can fast forward through the lectures  while less prepared students can play them over and over.  Read on to find more about this amazing medium—the online courses!  17   CHAPTER 2  Online Courses  Online courses are great learning resources, because they are more  engaging than books for people to learn. Also, some people just don’t like  to or can’t read that well. Therefore, it’s a good idea to repackage your book  as an online course—you can reach more people.  Online courses are great passive income generators. You create the   content once and reap the benefits every month, every week, or every day. The truth is that I attempted to record screencasts before, but I failed   miserably. It was quite challenging to code and speak at the same time,  and I didn’t like the result. But when I invited a camera crew to my live  training  and paid them , there was no way out for me except to deliver the  training and be recorded.  I was happy that I did invite that camera crew, because at the end  of editing, I got almost six hours of HD video. I supplemented it with  screencasts, quizzes, PDFs, and an online forum.  That online course brought me over $10,000. I host it on Udemy and  sell it on Udemy and Gumroad  see Figure 2-1 . The course was featured  on SlackSocial  popular deals website  and continues to bring me around  $500 each month passively, without me marketing it. If I market it, I can  generate more income with promotions and bundles.    Azat Mardan 2018  A.

Udemy report: January spike’s attributed to author  promotions and Udemy deals  If you are confident in your materials and delivery, then create an   online course right now. I wasn’t 100% confident in Node Program in the  beginning, which is why I started with the in-person training first. For  the in-person training, the feedback loop is shorter. If a student asks you  a question, you can answer it right away and improve your material to  address that issue.  In an online course, you can have an online forum or discussion   board to address questions. Udemy and other platforms provide forums.  However, you don’t want to go back and reshoot a video each time there is  an issue.  20   Chapter 2    Online COurses  That’s why it’s good to test the materials  slides, examples, etc.  with  in- person training before you record them. This is especially true when  you are doing high definition, professional quality videos with a camera  crew, which will cost you a lot of money.  Our heritage and ideals, our code and standards—the things we  live by and teach our children—are preserved or diminished by how  freely we exchange ideas and feelings. —Walt Disney  The best format  not the only one  for online courses is videos. You can   have the following variations:     Text: You write instructions and other materials.     Slides with voiceover: You have slides, change them,   and talk over each slide explaining things.     Screencast with voiceover: You go over some task by  showing your screen actions while talking through  your steps.     Slides or screencasts with a talking head: Same as two   previous ones, but with a small screen of your head that  talks.     You and the whiteboard: This is the most engaging   format, because it mimics a natural lecture.     Your fingers on a tablet: Similar to a screencast,   typically used for complex math formulas.  Let’s go over each of them.  21   Chapter 2    Online COurses   Text The text-based course is probably the oldest format for distance remote  education. Nowadays, you can set up an automated email sequence with  MailChimp1, AWeber,2 or Gumroad. Students sign up and get emails with  content delivered every day, each week, or some other interval that you  specify.  If you have an ebook or a series of posts, it’s trivial to repackage them   as an email sequence. The more content formats you have, the more  people you’ll reach. Don’t hesitate to repackage, because most people  prefer only one or two formats.  For example, one person might prefer a RSS feed, but another prefers   a newsletter, and yet another prefers a better formatting in an ebook or  needs reminders that an email sequence can provide. If you’re utilizing  only one format, you’re missing out.   Slides with Voiceover This is the easiest and most popular format. If you’re camera shy, this one  is for you. Hey, you can even hire a voiceover actor if you think your voice  is not sexy enough. VoiceBunny3, Amazon’s ACX,4 and oDesk5 are good  places to look for professional voice actors.  However, this is the most boring variation of content delivery. If you  go this route, make sure your slides are entertaining. Change them every  5-10 seconds. There’s nothing worse than staring at the same screen for   1 http:  mailchimp.com 2 http:  www.aweber.com 3 http:  voicebunny.com 4 http:  www.acx.com 5 http:  odesk.com  22   Chapter 2    Online COurses  minutes. Our attention span is very short, and it’s hard to watch a static  video. We want explosions, car chases, gun fights… you get the idea.  My point is, if you want to stand out in your niche  especially if your   niche is a crowded one , you want to provide something more interesting  than just slides with voiceover.  But if you’re intimidated and or your niche is not saturated yet and  you want to publish something as soon as possible—use this format. It’s  better to provide something than nothing at all. You can always make it  better later.  The benefit is that there is no cost if you use your own voice. You can   use Keynote for slides and voice recording.  For the voice recording, I use Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Cardioid   Condenser USB Microphone6.   Screencasts with Voiceover Screencasts are the most popular form of content delivery in technical  programming courses. This is due to the multiple steps that a typical  process requires, and this format makes it easier to show long processes  than to write those things up.  Where is that button you need to press?  How do you launch this app?   Again, you can hire a professional voice actor. Make sure he she knows   the technical terms.  I use the ScreenFlow app7 for MacOS X. It costs around $100, but it can   record your screen, voice, and face. It also has nice features like different  cursors, keystroke annotation, animation, and others. For these reasons,  ScreenFlow is a good investment. I use it to record other’s webinars and  some Skype calls as well! :-   6 http:  amzn.to 1aTkvrm 7 http:  origin.telestream.net screenflow  23   Chapter 2    Online COurses   Slides with a Talking Head Slides screencasts with a talking head is an improvement over the  previous two formats. Humans are wired to react to other human faces.  You can use this approach to create more personal content.  Showing yourself will build more trust and likeability. Remember,  people do business with those whom they know, like, and trust. If you  show them your face, you’ll address two out of these three items. In other  words, they will know and trust you more.  Make sure your background is good enough and appropriate. It doesn’t  have to be sterile  white  or professional. In fact, a personal touch will help  to build trust. For example, I have a monkey in my background sitting on  a stack of books that I’ve written. Just make sure your background doesn’t  have anything distracting or very repulsing to some folks.  Again, I use the ScreenFlow app for MacOS X and my MacBook Air HD   camera. I make the picture 25% so the quality is bearable.  Benefits: more human-like interaction and more engagement and   less boredom. This is the format that I used for my second online course,  Mongoose8.   You and the Whiteboard The you and the whiteboard format is one of the best delivery formats for  online courses. Most people whose courses I have taken use this format:  The Foundation, Amazing Selling Machine, Launch, and Expert Academy.  The whiteboard can be substituted with flip charts.  8 http:  www.mongoosecourse.com  24   Chapter 2    Online COurses  An instructor with a whiteboard is more oriented to a business-like   course versus technical topics. For technical content, you can have a  screen as a projector or in a separate window. Think of the last tech  meetup or a conference that you attended. They probably used a projector.  The benefits: A natural delivery. Cons: These are costly to produce because you’ll probably have to buy   rent the equipment to have proper quality, background, and lighting, or  pay camera crew to do that for you.  This is the format that I’ve used for my first online course, Node   Program. Although I recommend shooting videos for an online course  by themselves, not at the live training. This way you can chunk them into  three-five minute pieces easier. Also, you can achieve better video quality.   Your Fingers on a Tablet Your fingers or stylus on a tablet variation is similar to screencasts,  but you’ll use a special touch screen or graphical tablet. The benefit is  that using a tablet is more versatile than typing in an editor. You can  draw complex formulas, chart, graphs, etc. In a sense, this is akin to a  whiteboard, but zoomed in. The zooming in allows for fewer distractions.  You see a lot of this format used on Khan Academy  see Figure 2-2  and   Udacity. You can supplement this format with a talking head.  25   Chapter 2    Online COurses  Figure 2-2.  Math formulas from The Beauty of Algebra Khan  Academy video  Benefits: It provides a more flexible delivery with fewer distractions   than on a whiteboard.  format.  Cons: You’ll probably need some software and hardware to utilize this   The best approach, if money and time are not an issue, is to go back  and forth between recording yourself on the fullscreen, screencasts, and  whiteboard, depending on the content.  For example, in the beginning, you want to provide an overview and   an introduction. You don’t need any screencasts or whiteboarding for that,  so you just shoot yourself explaining the agenda. Then, when you want  to show some formulas charts lists, you can use a tablet or a whiteboard.  When you want to show how to create something on a computer or use  some service website, you switch to a screencast format.  Once you have the videos, it’s time to convert them into a web-friendly   format. The application that I’m using does it for me. It can even do so in  batches, which is very convenient because conversion takes some time.  With batching, I can start the process for 10 videos and then go for a walk  and come back an hour later to the converted videos  ready for uploading .  26   Chapter 2    Online COurses   Hosting Your Course For hosting, I use Udemy because it’s a marketplace, meaning I get  new students organically without paying for ads or sending emails.  Marketplaces are good for establishing new followings. So if your goal is to  get more followers and establish yourself in the space, then a marketplace  such as Udemy is a good platform to start.  Udemy doesn’t restrict you to only their platform. For this reason, you  can host on Udemy and other sites. You don’t even have to list your course  on the marketplace.  You can only host, but sell somewhere else. To do this, you create a   coupon on Udemy and paste it to your PayPal or Gumroad checkout page.  The checkout page is a page that buyers see after they’ve paid.  Let’s say you listed on the marketplace and went through their   approval. In this case, Udemy takes 50% if they brought the student. And  Udemy takes only 3% if you brought the student. To do it, you’ll need to  create a 100% price coupon code link. It’s called the author promotion.  It can be lower than 100%. Any coupon will be treated as an author  promotion and will net you the maximum 97% of the purchase price. In  contrast to author promotions, if Udemy brings students, they call it an  organic sales search.  It’s possible to opt-in for affiliate programs. In this case, the cut is even  smaller than with organic sales. The benefit is that you potentially can have  more sales.  To summarize, you get the best features—quizzes, discussions, and  mobile apps—for free. And if you want, Udemy can even bring you new  customers when you publish on the marketplace. That’s right, you can opt  out of the marketplace, meaning your course will be accessible only via  the link that you can promote yourself on your blog or in your email, and  not via Udemy search. You can even opt out of the promotions and affiliate  deals.  27   Chapter 2    Online COurses  Udemy are:  So, where is the catch with Udemy? The only three drawbacks of using      Udemy requires your course to have a minimum  number of minutes in a video  30 minutes now9 .     Udemy requires you to go through a review process.  I had almost 300 students and eight five-star reviews,  and they still didn’t want to approve my course for the  marketplace. They finally did after lots of back-and-  forth emails.     Udemy likes to discount courses a lot, which   commoditizes products and cheapens the brand. More  on that next.  I mean, they really discount a lot, like 90% off, or a $10 price for a $200  course. So, if you’re in a marketplace where your course is $200 and other  courses are $10, it’s almost impossible to compete.  You have to discount as other courses do, which cheapens your brand.   It can also make your existing students angry. Yes, Udemy has a 100%  refund policy, but students still get angry if they paid $200 two weeks ago  for a course that’s now on sale for $10. When they are mad, they leave bad  reviews. Personally, I don’t get mad about deals like that because I needed  the course two weeks ago when I bought it, and I like to reward the authors  with the full price!  Therefore, if your plan is to price courses at a premium  $500 and up ,  pick an independent solution such as the ones listed next. They allow you  to white-label  brand with your name , use your own domain name, and  run any type of promotions. They don’t get a percentage of your sales.  9 https:  support.udemy.com customer portal articles   1587467-getting-started-guidelines  28   Here is a list of online course solutions that give you freedom and   control  in no particular order  and that offer hosting  ∼$100 mo :  Chapter 2    Online COurses  Another approach, if you’re tech savvy and know how to use   WordPress, is to host the course yourself  hosting is cheap, starting from  $4.99 mo  by using WordPress and a WP plugin like one of these:     Summit Evergreen10     Kajabi11     Patience.io12     Fedora13     Sensei14     OptimizePress15     LearnDash16     CoursePress17     WP Courseware18  I tried Kajabi for my Mongoose course.

In the end, I canceled my Kajabi  account and migrated 300 of my students to Udemy.  Needless to say, online courses, like any other products, bring the best  results when you have a proper product launch. In other words, instead of  just emailing once, you create a sequence that builds the anticipation.   Pre-Selling You can also pre-sell the online course, the Kickstarter way.  I pre-sold the Mongoose course using Gumroad. Kickstarter didn’t   approve me, because back then, they were using Amazon payments.  Amazon wanted me to fax them my ID, which I did with HelloFax, but  Amazon still didn’t like those copies and denied me.  Do you want to know who you are? Don’t ask. act! action will  delineate and define you. —thomas Jefferson  My goal was to determine the interest in the course. I wanted to get at  least $1,000 for a one-hour course. Therefore, I spent 30 minutes creating  a Gumroad page. I wrote some bullet points and described the offer. I set a  one week time frame and blasted to my followers. I reached my $1,000 goal  in two days. At the end of the week, I had $2,600 in funding.  I attribute my success to the fact that I offered tiers. The course itself   was ridiculously low-priced. Just $1! However, I included these upsells:          $20 for the Mongoose course and five ebooks  $50 for the Mongoose course, five ebooks, and a six-  hour Node Program course  More than half of the 300 students opted for the $20 and $50 options.  30   Chapter 2    Online COurses  The course itself took me just a few days to produce, including code   examples. After the release, the Mongoose course earned me another  $5,000 and continues to bring profits passively. That’s why I love online  courses. They require less work than books, and the economics ROI   return on investment  are much better. The book is anchored at $20, $40  maximum, and even lower for fiction  $0.99 , but the mental price ceiling  on courses hasn’t been set yet. Some people charge $500, $1,000, $4,000,  and higher, for their courses. And if their students are satisfied and make  5-10 times more than they spent, it’s a win-win situation for everyone.  However, this won’t last for long. I already see trends on Udemy that  tell me the marketplaces will be saturated very soon. Type “baking” in a  search box at the Amazon.com site and you’ll see thousands of books, but  only a few on Udemy  as of this writing, March 2015 . This will change  soon and I want you to participate in it.  Pick something you’re interested in learning about, or something   you’re already passionate and knowledgeable about. Even better, if your  niche is underrepresented right now, you have the first mover advantage.  Again, you don’t have to be a super-duper expert on something for you   to publish a course on it. In fact, the mere act of preparing the course will  increase your expertise, improve your skills, and sharpen your knowledge.  The best way to learn is to teach.  You don’t need anyone’s permission to publish a course on something.   All you have to do is to provide value. As long as you are a step ahead of  someone, you’ll provide value to that person. Price your course according to  the value and competition, and you’ll be successful.  Avoid cutting corners, if you can. If it’s worth doing, do it properly.   However, if you are the type of person who is prone to analysis paralysis,  procrastination, and overdoing the research, then for you the opposite is  true. That is, “Done is better than perfect”. Just put something up already,  get feedback as soon as you can, and make it better later.  31   CHAPTER 3  Webinars  Webinars are online presentations. They’re typically done live. They can  be part of your online course or offered on their own. For this reason,  webinars are somewhere between in-person courses and recorded online  courses. However, webinars are usually shorter than an average course.  A webinar can last one or two hours. So, think about a webinar as a class  rather than an entire course. When webinars are part of online courses,  they allow students to interact with the instructor by asking questions and  providing feedback.  Webinars require very little preparation, but you can reach anybody   who has an Internet connection. Webinars are a good first step before  recording online courses because:     You can iterate on the content fast.     You can test the demand and pricing.     You don’t need thorough preparation and investment    e.g., rental space .  Of course, you can do a series of webinars for your course. Let’s say you   have six one-hour calls. You can package them as a course by recording  them. Later, you can sell access to the recordings. Obviously, the quality  of recording would be subpar, but if this minimum viable product gets  traction, you can always re-record everything later. This approach will  allow you to start with less friction.    Azat Mardan 2018  A. Mardan, Using Your Web Skills To Make Money,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3922-3_3  33   Chapter 3    Webinars  You can price webinars very low, or even free, and use them to build  a following or upsell people on the recorded course or membership  or  any other higher-end product or service . I see more and more companies  switching to this marketing strategy, because traditional and online  advertisements are not as effective anymore. There are so many ads, so the  more value you provide right away, the better your chances are.  If you go the route of using a webinar as the promotion for your other  products, make sure your webinar provides really good value and isn’t just  a sales pitch. Make it an hour long, pitch your product or service at the very  end, and don’t spend more than 25% of the time on the offer. Focus on  providing good value, not pitching your product.  One of the best webinar software products is GotoMeeting   GotoWebinar. It’s not cheap. If you’re on a budget or just want to  experiment, use Google on Air. As an added benefit, Google on Air will  automatically upload your webinar to YouTube. If you want to keep your  recordings private, then make sure you unlist them on YouTube.  Some people automate the webinar itself. In this case, they created a  webinar a few times already and have a few recordings of it. Those people  just play the recording of a webinar; they are not there themselves. You can  spot it by asking a question, and if you don’t get an answer, then it could be  a recording. It could be that they ignored you or didn’t see your question.  I shy away from recorded webinars, especially when a webinar is   promoted as live but it’s not, because I value the feedback that I get from  the attendees.  Some entrepreneurs like Lewis Howes1 made their whole business   with webinars.  What’s good about webinars is that you educate people and build trust   and credibility right away. Those three things will help you sell, and even  if they don’t buy right away, you’ll be able to ping them for other webinars   1 http:  lewishowes.com  34   or offers. For this, you need to gather attendee emails during registration.  This is a crucial step. Don’t skip it. The DIY way: use Gumroad for that.  Read on for more options.  Chapter 3    Webinars   How to Create a Webinar Let me repeat it: you don’t have to have a product  a webinar in this case   in order to sell it. This is ethical, because you state upfront that the product  will be delivered in a week or the money will be refunded. It’s not a scam  and it will allow you to pick the topic that people will be interested in.  action is the foundational key to all success. — pablo picasso  When you create a webinar, you need the following components:     Registration page: This is the page where you pitch   your webinar and collect emails, names, and payments   optional .     Webinar service software: This is the application that  you’ll be using to broadcast video and voice as well as  interact with listeners.     A way to retain emails: Your registration form can be   as simple as a Google Forms  which enters data into a  spreadsheet  or as sophisticated as MailChimp. But you  must have the emails to notify, remind, and follow up.  That’s all you need. Easy, right? Here are some optional components:     A follow-up survey: This is your chance to improve, so   don’t miss this opportunity.     An offer: This is how you sell or upsell  sell into a higher   tier package .  35   Chapter 3    Webinars     A payment system: If your webinar is paid, you’ll need a   way to collect money. The platforms that have worked  for me well are Gumroad and PayPal.     Slides and speaker notes for 1-2 hour presentation:   The best thing is that you can prepare them later, after  you’ve pre-sold the webinar.  This is how I did it on Gumroad. You can:    1.  Create a free product in Gumroad. You can   add questions and make some of the questions  mandatory.    2.  Create a Google on Air link.    3.  Paste that link into your Gumroad checkout page.    4.  Create an automated email sequence that will   remind attendees about the event and build the  anticipation.  How do you price your offering? I have seen prices at around $50   for two-hour webinars. Of course, it depends on the topic, brand  your  reputation , and many other things. But the payoff is tremendous!  Let’s do the simple math here. You spend two hours putting together   the registration page. Then, you spend another day or two preparing slides  and two more hours on the presentation itself. That’s 2.5 days of time. By  the way, you can reuse your slides later so your return on investment  ROI   with you investing mostly your time will only get better. And maybe you’ve  got 10 people. That’s $500. You can do them every week, so that’s $2,000  per month of net income.  36   Chapter 3    Webinars  Imagine if you were spending only two hours each week earning   $2,000 in profit. This is entirely possible after you tighten up your slides  and delivery by running a few webinars. Needless to say, this is all location  independent, so you can be in Hawaii or the Caribbean, sipping some  fancy drink and enjoying the warm, fresh breeze. I don’t know about you,  but to me it sounds incredibly good!  But wait, there’s no limit on how many people you can have on a single  webinar. You can double, triple, quadruple, or 10x your attendees without  spending any more time. You can invest money in ads to get more people  signed up.  If working with a lot of people  webinars can have hundreds of people    is frightening for you at this stage of your career, consider one-on-one  coaching. Maybe you’re already doing it but just haven’t realized what it is.  Now you can make it official and start charging money for your valuable  insights and mentoring.  37   CHAPTER 4  One-on-One Coaching  Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have  not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of  competence and performance. In teaching, we rely on the “naturals,”  the ones who somehow know how to teach. —Peter Drucker  Another avenue that you might want to explore is one-on-one coaching.  This model has the following benefits:     Higher pay rate: You can make more per hour than at   your day job. Think of it as wholesale  full-time day  job  versus retail  one-on-one coaching . Wholesale is  cheaper per unit  an hour .     Test new topics and courseware: You can test new   material and get feedback right away.     Flexibility: You can make it as flexible as you want,  because you pick the hours and location or make it  remote.    Azat Mardan 2018  A. Mardan, Using Your Web Skills To Make Money,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3922-3_4  39   ChaPTer 4    One-On-One COaChIng  The ways to get clients:     Word of mouth     Conferences and networking events     Skill schools related to your trade     Existing followers     Books  I use a service called Calendly1. It syncs with your Google calendar   and automatically avoids conflicts. So no more back-and-forth emails with  dates and times; you just send your Calendly link and let the other person  pick the time when you’re open.  Calendly also has reminders. Make sure you use them, as most people  tend to forget about events and are distracted by a myriad of other things.  ScheduleOnce2 is another scheduling service you can use. Make people pay and call you, instead of you calling them. This way   you know they are serious and won’t miss the appointment. You can offer  100% happiness refunds unless they miss the appointment.  Here are a few other tips that I got from a yoga teacher about one-on-   one work:     Have coupons or credits: For example, if they buy four  hours, they get a discounted per hour rate  $100 hour,  but $350 for four hours .     Have expiration dates for credits: For example, the   credit expires in six months. You don’t want to move  out of the area or focus on other industry trade and  have this person contact you in a year or two  I had one  gentleman who did exactly this before I knew better .  1 http:  calendly.com 2 http:  www.scheduleonce.com  40   ChaPTer 4    One-On-One COaChIng     Meet in a public space or in an office with transparent  walls or a window: Meeting at your home can put you  and the client in an uncomfortable position.     Schedule online meetings as often as possible to cut   down commute time: The added benefit is that you can  record the session  video and voice or just voice  and  send it over to the mentee. You can use the recording to  reflect back on yourself and to improve.     Have a strict policy and notify mentees in writing.     Have an appointment cancelation timeframe in  your policy: This means if they want to cancel an  appointment or move it to other time when it’s very  close to the appointment, you keep the fee. The reason  is that you can have someone else take that slot.  Typically, 24-48 hours works fine. If you’re busy  most  of us are , make it a week!  The best thing is that you can use one-on-one consultation for   customer development. The gist of customer development is asking what  people liked and didn’t like about your product and what issues they have.  In this instance, the coaching is free or very inexpensive. I suggest charging  some token amount of money. However, you can refund the entire sum  after the call in any case except if the person didn’t show up. Again, this  approach will encourage good callers and keep them engaged and in  control  they are making the appointment and the call, instead of you cold  or warm calling them .  41   CHAPTER 5  Apprenticeships  Apprenticeships are a more structured and lengthier way of coaching other  people. You want them to commit to an extended period of time. I made  it three months for my first apprenticeship program. The basic idea is that  someone pays you so you can teach them by giving them assignments.  Why bother? Because of the following:     Free help with your projects     Enormous fulfillment from helping others     Extra income for you     Build deeper relationships than with online courses  Be clear about the benefits your apprentices will be getting. This is   my Facebook post. It went viral organically like a cancer. From this single  post, I got over 30 responses and accepted three apprentices into my first  program:      I provide a unique opportunity to people who know  a little bit of HTML and CSS, but want to learn more  about JavaScript and Node.js  JavaScript on the server .     You can get weekly coaching, code reviews, and maybe  even paired programming sessions from the author of  seven books on JavaScript and Node.js.    Azat Mardan 2018  A.

Remote online  weird hours are okay.  Should you charge for participation? I say yes. You’ll get these benefits:     You’ll have only serious and committed people apply.     You’ll have a better attendance rate at your meetings.     You’ll have people working more seriously on your   projects.  You can always offer a refund if you’re not sure about how much value   you end up providing. :-   Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember.

Credibility: Their names will be on the projects that we   worked on  credibility boost .     References: They can use me as a reference on resumes   and when job hunting.  It helps to open an apprenticeship if you already have a following or   existing customers.  Masterminds are similar to apprenticeships, but they involve people  who are mostly at your level of expertise, perhaps little bit higher or little  bit lower.  45   CHAPTER 6  Masterminds  Masterminds are like-minded folks who gather together, typically once a  week, to brainstorm ideas and beliefs, ask questions, and share concerns.  Most prominent people are involved in some sort of mastermind group.  There is a limit to what one human can learn and know. The limit is  individual for a person, but when you develop a mastermind, it can  amplify the effect so that 1+1 becomes 3, not 2.  The mastermind is a powerful tool for business and personal growth.  But why do I include mastermind in a book on generating extra income?  Because you can make a mastermind into a business. If you can provide  enough value, people will be willing to pay $1,000 or even $10,000 for access.  I am a part of Neil Strauss’  bestselling author  mastermind as well  as two masterminds that I organized myself. My own mastermind’s goal  is sharing knowledge and helping each other, not profit. However, for my  online mastermind, I charge a token amount of money  $20 per person per  month , which is set aside to pay for professional conference software, and  cloud storage for our call recordings, books, and online courses.  If you would like to scale the mastermind idea as a business idea, to   bring more people on board, then a membership community is the answer.    Azat Mardan 2018  A.

Think of them as  Facebook groups behind the membership fee  if you’re familiar with  Facebook . This concept is an outstanding way to earn recurring revenue.  You can use membership sites as standalone products. You can also pair  the community access with access to your products  books or online  courses  or apprenticeships.  Membership communities can:     Become self-sufficient, with other users posting and   answering questions instead of you doing it all the time   the magic number is around 200 active users .     Bring you predictable recurring revenue, unlike books   and courses, which need new customers to generate  income.     Be very fulfilling.     Be a great resource for you to learn as well.     Be used as a networking tool  find a job, reach out to a   company, etc. .     Create a long-lasting and engaging relationship if the   community stays active.    Azat Mardan 2018  A. Mardan, Using Your Web Skills To Make Money,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3922-3_7  49   Chapter 7    MeMbership CoMMunities  You can use a Facebook group, but it’s hard to monetize it, and not   everyone has a Facebook account.  I recommend that you use one of the independent solutions to create   your online community. This way, you’ll have total control over the  content and payments. If you shy away from investing into community  SaaS  Software as a Service , then consider WordPress and a plugin, or  HackHall1  coding is required to set it up .  HackHall is my project, but it’s open source, which means it’s free for   anyone to download, modify, and use  personal or commercial use—I  don’t care as long as you link it back to me .  To download the code and get started with HackHall, go to  or send the   link to your developer  the GitHub page at http:  github.com azat-co  hackhall.  Building an active membership community is probably the hardest  concept outlined in this book. You have the chicken and egg problem.  Quality members won’t come before you have good content and good  content won’t appear by itself without quality members who contribute  good content. I haven’t built a membership community myself yet.  HackHall is in the pre-launch phase. But based on my research, the  magical number when then community becomes active by itself is 200  active members. It seems very achievable!  1 http:  github.com azat-co hackhall  50   CHAPTER 8  Conclusion  I’m sure there will be new income strategies in the future. The most  important thing is to start and finish something. You can always make  it better later. Pick a small project and tackle it relentlessly and with  obsession.  I noticed that most people don’t suffer from a lack of knowledge.   Instead, they have an abundance of information available to them. Yet,  most of them don’t succeed in reaching their goals, because they feel  overwhelmed and scared  what if this won’t work? , lack clear plans, and  don’t follow through consistently. Consistency is paramount for progress.  Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things  that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the  bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in  your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. —Mark Twain  Make a clear and realistic plan of action. Chunk down the big goals  into smaller, doable, easy steps. This will keep the fears at bay. Have a  person whom you respect follow up on your milestones every now   and then.    Azat Mardan 2018  A. Mardan, Using Your Web Skills To Make Money,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3922-3_8  51   ChapTEr 8    ConCluSion  The last tip is to start small and build momentum and confidence.   Don’t wait for a million dollar idea. Act on what’s within reach. Sooner or  later, some bigger opportunity or idea will show up.
