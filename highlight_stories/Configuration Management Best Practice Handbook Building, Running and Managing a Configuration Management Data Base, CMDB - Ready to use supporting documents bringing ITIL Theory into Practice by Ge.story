The supporting documents and resources found within the book will help you fill  these gaps by giving you a focused, practical and user-friendly approach to  Configuration  Management.        Page 8    Configuration Management    CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT        Configuration Management covers the identification, recording and reporting of  IT components, including their versions, constituent components and  relationships.         Page 9    Configuration Management         These bullet points help to illustrate why it is that we need to introduce the  disciplines of effective and efficient Process management into our IT  environments.            Page 10    Configuration Management         ITSM is not something on its own, but closely linked to the business.  Explain difference between ‘effective’  doing the right thing  and ‘efficient’  doing  the right thing the right way .    The objective tree is a useful way to help explain the importance of IT being a  supporting department to the business.    To meet organizational objectives, the organization has business processes  in place.  Examples of business processes are sales, admin and financial  who have a  “sales process”  or logistics, customer service and freight  who have a  “customer returns process”.     Each of the units involved in these business processes needs IT Services  e.g.  CRM application, e-mail, word processing, financial tools .    Each of these services runs on IT infrastructure that has to be properly managed   Service Management . IT Infrastructure includes hardware, software,  procedures, policies, documentation, etc.    ITIL provides a framework for the management of IT Infrastructure.      Page 11    Configuration Management         Traditionally we look at the IT department as a collection of specialists with  specialist skills. This is a functional way to look at IT and it puts people into  departmental silos.          Page 12    Configuration Management         Best practice processes will transverse functional departments and help to break  down the silos walls barriers to communication between them.    Explain the benefits of processes in general.  Other points to explain:      A process is a set of activities with a common goal.     A process can measure the input, output and activities.     A process will link these measurements to targets.   Page 13            Configuration Management         An IT organization needs to focus on all these aspects to deliver the right IT  services  effective  in the right way  efficient .    Generally, the technology perspective gets a lot of attention  time, budget,  people, etc .    More and more people s ee the importance of processes  which is why ITIL is  getting so popular .     There is also an organization perspective: the alignment of vision, strategy and  goals with the day to day activities in IT. This is useless, if it is not communicated   which is virtually always the case  and finally, there is the people perspective,  which looks at the ‘soft side’: is your staff happy, do they have the right skills, are  you managing them effectively, etc.            Page 14    Configuration Management         Configuration Management is one of 10 ITIL processes. Here we get to see the  others and the one function  Service Desk . Security Management can be  included as well, due to its critical importance.    Make sure that participants understand that Configuration Management is not an  isolated process, but:        provides input for Incident Management     has a strong link with Change management and updates CMDB when   changes are successful      provides information to all other processes     maintains information linked to CIs provided by other processes etc.   Page 15            Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Policies Objective and Scope on page  59 within this workbook.         Page 16    Configuration Management         Configuration Management comes from the Service Support Set.    Here is an excellent slide that shows the relationship between Configuration  Management and the other Service Support processes.    Focus on the fact that the goal of Configuration Management provides the basis  for the other processes to do their respective jobs.     Make sure the participants fully understand the necessity of the process to  support not only the Service Support set, but the Service delivery set as well.          Page 17    Configuration Management         This is the official ITIL objective statement.    For more information please refer to Objectives and Goals on page 63  within this workbook.        Page 18    Configuration Management         These two concepts are central to the Configuration Management process.    Most CMDB’s can be purchased as software tools. Today most vendors of such  tools are getting their solutions accredited as being ITIL compliant.            Page 19    Configuration Management         The first bullet on this slide helps to explain the fundamental difference between  Configuration Management and Asset Management. Asset Management  typically does not track relationships between different CIs.    Setting a baseline helps us to track overall infrastructure changes over time.          Page 20    Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Configuration Process Manager on  page 67 within this workbook.           Page 21    Configuration Management      Notes:         Page 22    Configuration Management      The roles within the function should include Configuration Manager, Asset  Manager, Change Manager, Change Administrator, Release Manager and  relevant Change Advisory Board s .         Page 23    Configuration Management      Notes:         Page 24    Configuration Management         Many organizations are already using some elements of Configuration  Management, often using spreadsheets, local databases or paper-based  systems. In today's large and complex IT infrastructures, Configuration  Management requires the use of support tools, which includes a Configuration  Management Database  CMDB .    The CMDB is extremely important as is the control of all changes made to it.          Page 25    Configuration Management      When we start to think about populating the CMDB with information we need to  consider what we will control and to what level of detail we want to control.

Page 27    Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Identification guidelines on page 85  within this workbook.         Page 28    Configuration Management      The basic activities of Configuration Management are as follows:      Identification      Planning        Control     Status Accounting     Verification and Audit      Page 29    Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Status Accounting Guidelines on  page 91 within this workbook.         Page 30    Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Verification & Audit Plan on page 95  within this workbook.            Page 31    Configuration Management      For more information please refer to Verification & Audit Plan on page 95  within this workbook.         Page 32    Configuration Management      Automated processes to load and update the Configuration Management  database should be developed where possible so as to reduce error and reduce  costs         Page 33    Configuration Management         In this section we are looking at the layer below the Process layer, by starting to  review specific activities that need to be drawn up as procedures.            Page 34    Configuration Management      Notes:         Page 35    Configuration Management         Many organizations have some for or Configuration Management in operation,  but it is often paper-based. For large and complex infrastructures, Configuration  Management will operate more effectively when supported by a software tool is  capable of maintaining a CMBD.            Page 36    Configuration Management      The Configuration Management system should prevent Changes from being  made to an IT infrastructure without valid authorization via Change  Management.         Page 37    Configuration Management         Selecting a tool involves tool requirements and vendor requirements.    You could have a great tool, but if the supplier goes bankrupt, you’re stuck.  These are fairly straightforward requirements.        Page 38    Configuration Management         As mentioned on previous page, equally important.    For more information please refer to CMBD Design Document on page 99  within this workbook.        Page 39    Configuration Management      Like any element of IT, the Total Cost of Ownership  TCO  is always going to be  much more than any initial purchase price.                  Page 40    Configuration Management      Buying a tool should be considered as a project in itself, given the costs   previous page              Page 41    Configuration Management         When we look at CIs we need to establish clear guidelines regarding the detail  we want to hold and names and other codes required.    USEFUL TIP…  What ever is initially thought of, WAIT for at least a week before  committing. During this time other considerations will arise.  Think how  when establishing codes, etc.  you can have flexibility for the future.     e.g. Instead of numbering 1, 2, 3 – use numbering 100, 200, 300…  this way  you can insert 110, 120, 121, 122 – if sub units materialize.           Page 42    Configuration Management         Configuration Management is heavily dependent up on a number of other  disciplines. Effective Change Management, software control, Release  Management, operational acceptance testing, and procedures for the installation  and acceptance of new different hardware and network components are all  essential.          Page 43    Configuration Management      Notes:         Page 44    Configuration Management         The impact codes are useful to classify CIs that are already identified as having  a high  or low  business impact.    Priority codes are useful for identifying the sequence of CIs that should be  changed.           Page 45    Configuration Management         Change Management relies heavily on Configuration Management for  information about IT infrastructure that could be affected by a Change.    For more information please refer to Communication Plan on page 107  within this workbook.        Page 46    Configuration Management      The next few slides are on reporting and answers questions like:      How to align the Configuration Management process to the business      strategy?      What to measure?     What to report on?           Page 47    Configuration Management         A Mission Statement should be appropriate for a specific organization. Avoid  fuzzy, generic, non-committal statements  like the one in the slide . A Mission  Statement should provide staff with a clear direction, a sense of motivation and a  base for operational goals.    The business plan will explain how you intend to realize your vision or live up to  your mission statement.    The goals   objectives are specific components of this  make sure they are  SMART .  The KPIs will tell you to what degree you’re successful.

However, the reader will certainly be reminded of the key topics that have to be  considered.    Policy Statement  A course of action, guiding principle, or procedure considered expedient,  prudent, or advantageous   Use this text box to answer the “SENSE OF URGENCY” question regarding this  process.    Why is effort being put into this process?  Not simply because someone thinks it’s a good idea. That won’t do. The reason has to  be based in business benefits.    You must be able to concisely document the reason behind starting or improving this  process.    Is it because of legal requirements or competitive advantage? Perhaps the business  has suffered major problems or user satisfaction ratings are at the point where  outsourcing is being considered.

Use this text box to answer the “WHERE ARE WE GOING” question regarding this  process.    What will be the end result of this process and how will we know when we have reached  the end result?  Will we know because we will establish a few key metrics or measurements or will it be  a more subjective decision, based on instinct?    A generic sample statement on the “objective” for Configuration Management is:    To create an environment where all IT services and infrastructure components   including relevant documentation  is under control. The Configuration  Management process aims to be a provider of information to contribute to an  effective and efficient planning, release and implementation of Changes to the IT  services.    Note the keywords in the statement. For the statement on Configuration  Management they are “under control” and “provider of information service”.  These are definite areas that we can set metrics for and therefore measure  progress.

What are the boundaries for this process?  What does the information flow look like into this process and from this process to other  processes and functional areas?    A generic sample statement on the “scope” for Configuration Management is:    To take responsibility for the control and management of information relating to IT  Infrastructure. By taking this responsibility to provide information to both Change  Management  CHANGEMGT  and Release Management  RELEASEMGT  so that the  impact of change is completely understood and the likelihood of negative impacts  from change are minimized.    Furthermore, this process will control information relating to personal computers,  shared information servers and all peripheral devices. However, the main frame  system and all associated services are excluded from the scope.

However, the reader will certainly be reminded of the key topics that have to be  considered.    The detailed objectives for Configuration Management should include the  following salient points:  Objective   Notes   A desire to provide accurate and correct  information on present configurations with both  the physical  specific attributes about a CI  and  functional specifications  part that the CI plays  and it’s relationships with other CIs .   Met Exceeded Shortfall    cid:46  ☺  cid:47    Dates names role titles   A storage objective related to definitive and  trusted copies of documentation, software and  other specification documents that have been  duly authorized.   After they have been agreed upon a specific  objective for the process is to continue reporting  metrics. This is an activity that is often forgotten  over time or simply not done from the out-set.    Undertaking logistical activities including the  labelling  after identification  and recording of  names and versions of the CIs that make up the  IT services and the IT infrastructure.   Ensuring the large volumes of data from  changes or when the process is first set up is  accurately entered into the CMDB and that the  entry is timely and not too late in order to deliver  process benefits.                     Page 64    Configuration Management    Verification and auditing duties so that we can  have an assurance that the actual state of the IT  infrastructure matches the authorized  configuration records and data  including  exception reporting .   Providing on-going awareness, education and  training for staff involved with the process and  communication to non-involved, but affected  personnel.         Use these objectives to generate discussion about others that may be more  appropriate to list than those provided             Page 65    Configuration Management    Page 66            Configuration Management    CONFIGURATION PROCESS MANAGER   IT Services  Roles, Responsibilities  Process: Configuration Management   Status:  Version:  Release Date:     0.1                                                                   Page 67    Configuration Management      Detailed responsibilities of the Configuration Management team    The Configuration Manager…..    1.

Unfortunately this growth has not always  been as structured and pre-planned as it needs to be.     This has resulted in the IT department not having a very clear picture of all the  services they currently provide with no accurate profile of the actual  customers for each of these services.     Therefore it has become imperative for the IT department to establish an  accurate picture of the services it provides.     This document describes an approach for mapping IT Services and their  components to the Business Process.   Mapping Business Process and IT Service: An approach    Most organizations now understand the benefits of having Information  Technology  IT  throughout their structure. Few realize the potential of truly  aligning the IT department’s objectives with the business objectives. However,  more and more organizations are beginning to recognize IT as being a crucial  delivery mechanism of services to their customers.    When the IT services are so critical, steps must be in place to ensure that the  IT group adds value and delivers consistently.    In line with this concept, the first step in mapping IT Services to the needs of  the business is to understand the Organization.         Page 74    Configuration Management    An organization starts with a Mission Statement. The Mission Statement for  an Organization defines its reason for being. Once we capture the Mission  Statement, the next thing to look at is the Vision Statement.    The Vision Statement defines where it is that the organization wants to go. By  understanding where the organization wishes to position itself within its  market space, then we can start looking at how its short term and long term  objectives align with this.     At this point we now need to start capturing the “objectives and strategy” of  the Organization. By having this information, IT departments are more likely to  be aware of the pressing business issues and needs that may impact on the  services that they provide. For example, the organization may have an  objective of expanding its business into new markets within the next 12  months, requiring additional offices and staff. The direct impact on IT  departments would be the successful planning of capacity of new IT Services,  the successful planning of how to change our current services to meet the  demands of the business, and being flexible enough to meet these demands.     However, an objective is not sufficient enough to determine how IT  departments should be delivering its services. The Organization will meet  these objectives by changing, enhancing or creating new business processes.  For example, Admin staff may need additional resources, a new ordering  package may be required, or perhaps a new billing process needs to be  implemented to meet these objectives.     Therefore, after capturing the Organizational objectives, we need to  understand how these map to current business process, if the current  business processes are changing or becoming obsolete and if there will be  any new business processes.     Once the IT departments have a clear view of each of the business units and  their business process, we need to capture the fact that the business      Page 75    Configuration Management    processes need one or more IT services  e.g. CRM application, e-mail, word  processing, financial tools  to function.     After having captured the IT Services, the next logical step is to break down  the services into the components that exist within the IT Infrastructure so that  we can then map them back to the IT Service.     The “components” that make up the IT Services are referred to as  configuration items or CIs for short.    This is generally considered the most difficult part of the process and requires  a reasonable amount of planning. The recommended approach is to run this  activity as a project in conjunction with the Configuration Management  process.     For further information please see the following documentation:     CONMGT3200  Configuration Management Implementation Plan   Project   Plan   CONMGT3300  Configuration Management Policies, Guidelines and Scope   CONMGT3800   Document  Identification Guidelines Document   CONMGT3900  Status Accounting Guidelines   CONMGT4000  Configuration Management Verification and Audit plan and   CONMGT4100  Configuration Management Database  CMDB  Design   templates   document and template.   Page 76          Configuration Management    A simple model for this approach is illustrated below.       What are the Objectives of the Organization? What is its Mission and      What Business Processes are in place or will be in place to meet these      What IT Services are needed or in place to service the Business      What are the configuration items of the IT Infrastructure that make up   Vision?   needs?   Processes?   the IT Services?   Business Objectives  Business Processes   IT Services   Configuration Items     Page 77                      Configuration Management    Benefit of the Approach    With the current world client it is becoming increasingly important for  organizations to be flexible in the services they deliver to their customers.  Customers are becoming more demanding and discerning in their approach to  buying service and products.     As a result of this organization are under increasing pressure to deliver quality  services. This has resulted in the business putting an even greater demand on  IT departments while at the same time trying to reduce the cost of IT Service  which have generally been seen as an overhead. As such, organizations are  paying greater attention to their IT departments and their approach in  delivering services.     The above approach provides IT departments with a structure in mapping and  recording the services that they deliver to the needs of the business. IT  departments that have been using this approach are now better positioned to  understand the make up of the services that they offer, the service level they  need to offer the services at, and the cost of these services.     The result of directly mapping IT Services to the business and understanding  how the Configuration Items make up the service can highlight where  insufficient resources exist, but even more importantly where there has been  an over expenditure on resources that may not be needed by the organization  anymore.     By directly mapping the configuration items to IT Services and how they are  aligned to the business, IT departments are better positioned to provide and  account for the services they need to deliver. This has resulted in better IT  spending in an economy where IT budgets are having greater demands  placed on them.       Page 78    Configuration Management    Mission Statement    A mission statement describes the reason for the organizations being. Without  an understanding of the mission statement of an organization, it becomes  hard to define what it is that the organization is trying to achieve.    In this section of the document capture the mission statement of the  organization. It is important to show that the IT department is aware of the  business.     Vision Statement    In this section, document the Vision statement for the Organization.     Below is a text example of what may be included in this section.    <<    Listed below is the Vision Statement for  :        Quality Care      Convenient Service      Good Experiences      Care at Competitive Prices      Service You'll Recommend to Friends and Family    These are the major goals of the staff at  . With over 150  services and 400 staff, we constantly strive to provide the highest-quality  service throughout the Mid-South.  >>        Page 79    Configuration Management    Business Process Summary    When trying to map out all the configuration items of the IT infrastructure, you  need to first ensure that you have clearly identified all the current business  processes that the organization is using to deliver services to their customers.  The list of business process will then be supported by IT Services. See next  section.    The below table is an example of a Business Process Summary Table.  Columns and Rows can be added as needed.     To find out about mapping Business Process and IT Services please see the  following document s :        Business and IT Service Mapping     <<    Process Name: The name of the process if available  Process Owner: The name of the Department head or Business  Representative for the process  Description: A brief description of the process  Department s : The Department s  that is involved or uses this process  Parent Process: Any process that may be considered a lead into this process  or is seen has having a higher business criticality  Triggers: What causes the process to start? This is important as IT can then  determine if and how their Services interact with other business process or  external organizations.      >>            Page 80    Configuration Management    Process  Name   Process  Owner   Description  Department s  Parent   Triggers   Process                                                               IT Service Summary    The next step in the process is to ensure that we capture a summary of the all  of the IT Services being provided to the business. Once we have a clear  picture of this, we can then start to think about breaking down the IT Services  down to the component level.    <<  IT Service: The name of the IT Service being provided to the organization.    Service Version: In some instances there may be Customers or Business  Units that are using the same service, for example email, but have in place  agreements for different levels of service for that IT Service. In these  instances it is advisable to capture the different “Service Versions”.    IT Service Owner: The owner or support group that is responsible for delivery  and support of the IT Service.     Description: A brief description of the IT Service. This is an optional field and  may be dropped for more important information.     Contract: In some instances IT Services will be provided in conjunction with a  contract. For internal IT departments, there may not be a contract for the  services they provide and therefore this field can be considered optional.    Page 81                      Configuration Management    Covering SLA: Capture any Service Level Agreements that apply to the IT  Service.     Service Hours: List the hours of operation for the IT Service.     Customer   Business Unit: List any those customers or business units that  use the IT Services.    Business Process: To understand the business impact of the IT Service it is  important to capture the Business Process that the IT Service supports.     Business Impact: If the IT Service is unavailable, how will this impact on the  business? This information can be used in conjunction with Service Level  Agreements and goes towards IT departments understanding how the service  that they provide will impact on the business. This in turn can help engender a  better sense of urgency when dealing with errors and incidents within the IT  Infrastructure.   >>     IT  Service   Service  Version   IT  Service  Owner                           Description  Contract  Covering   SLA         Service  Hours   Customer    Business  Unit   Business  Process   Business  Impact                                   IT Infrastructure Component Mapping    Once the Business Process and their corresponding IT Services are captured  and documented, it is then possible to start the mapping of the configuration  items.     The below table provides a template for capturing IT Components   Configuration Items  against the IT Services.       Page 82    Configuration Management    IT Components    Configuration Items  CI     CI    Serial    CI Name   Type   Sub- Type   SER345  15434563  EMERO   Hardware  Server   RT5700  54444443  CISCO-002  Hardware  Router   RT4567  76547457  CISCO-001  Hardware  Router   MS001  N A   MS Office   Software  Microsoft   A    cid:31     cid:31         cid:31    IT Services   B    cid:31     cid:31     cid:31        C    cid:31     cid:31        cid:31    D    cid:31     cid:31     cid:31     cid:31    Service   Service   Service   Service     This information is critical in providing quality and known services to the  organization.     For example, if we were to look at the two CISCO routers above, we can see  that CISCO-002 is integral to all four services listed above, whilst CISCO-001  is only integral to two of those services.     This information will now help in the planning process of Service Level  Management and agreeing to levels of service that rely on those particular  configuration items.   We can also use this information in conjunction with our IT Service Continuity  planning. In the above table it would be important to ensure that in the event  of CISCO-002 failing, affecting 4 services, that we have appropriate measures  in place.     After this mapping has occurred, we should be able to discover all those  configuration items that exist in our environments that are no longer part of a  larger IT Service. There are reported cases of IT departments discovering  large amounts of configuration items existing within the infrastructure that no  longer provide a service. In most cases, the IT department was still paying  maintenance and licensing fees for those parts of the infrastructure.    To get a list of your configuration items, you will need to go to your  Configuration Management Database.

The test is  to ask if that level of detail will be usable to assist business managers to make  more informed decisions.    If the answer is No, then carefully consider the value of maintaining  information to that depth. Time taken during this step will pay future rewards.    Proper prior planning prevents poor performance.    Configuration Item  CI  attributes    The following list provides examples of attributes that could be associated  with Configuration Items  CIs  in the CMDB.    As you would expect the most relevant attribute for a CI is based on it’s  substance  e.g. hardware, software, documentation, etc.    Note the difference between a CI, attribute and value can be explained using  this example..  A car would be a CI, Color would be an attribute, Red would  be the value      Attribute   Description   Notes Comments   CI Identifier   The unique identifier by which this type  of CI is referred to  NAME .   Unique Number   The number that uniquely identifies the  CI  e.g. software serial number,  hardware serial number .   CI Category   Whether the CI can be categorized as  documentation, hardware, software, etc.    Hardware  Model  Number   Model of the component  usually the  suppliers model number .    Warranty expiry   Date when the supplier's warranty                     Page 87    Configuration Management    date   expires for the component.   Version Number   The version number of the CI.   Location   The physical location of the component,  e.g. floor, cubicle, building number, city,  site.   Owner  Responsible   The name and  preferably  title of the  owner responsible for the CI.   Responsibility  Date   Date the above owner became  responsible for the CI.   CI Source   Licence   Was the component developed  internally or purchased from an outside  supplier.   Licence number or reference to licence  agreement  usually a paper licence  document    Supply Date   Date when the CI was delivered or the  organization took official ownership.   Current Status    Is the component currently in  production, live, archived, awaiting  destruction?   Scheduled Status  Within reason the next expected status   for this component.   Parent  relationships   The unique identifier of components  that this CI forms a component of.   Child relationships  The unique identifier of components   that this CI directly supports.

Configuration verification and audit  Configuration verification and audits are generally a series of reviews to verify  the physical existence of CIs and check that the CIs are correctly recorded in  the CMDB and controlled libraries. The checks also include the verification of   Page 96                            Configuration Management    release and configuration documentation before changing the live  environment.  An initial review is suggested after 3 months after Configuration Management  system implementation. However, if a high number of inaccuracies are found  then the frequency and intensity of the audits should be increased.    Automated configuration audits increases the efficiency and effectiveness  of most audits. Audit tools can determine software installed and identify the  major items of hardware configuration. This equates to an increased number  of CIs that are exposed to an audit. The primary benefit of automation is it will  allow staff to focus on exceptions or “rogue” components without the need to  check all the “acceptable” components  rules can be built into the audit tools  to report on “rogue” components only .    A Configuration baseline is a “snapshot” of a component or series of  components at a specific point in time. The purpose of the baseline is that it  allows us to monitor progress or changes to components more carefully. It  also provides us with a roll-back point if changes have to be undone at a later  stage.     Audits should be performed:   1.  Once per time period – Full audit  2.  Periodic audits on set components or functional or geographic areas.  3.  Before a major release or change  definitely to the specific components   that will be affected .   4.  Post change to verify planned changes reflect the actual  5.  After the implementation of any new Configuration Management   system  or upgrade    6.  Post recovery from disasters  7.

The Configuration Management system should provide   Characteristic   Notes Comments Relevance  Security controls that will restrict access as  appropriate.    Ability to support and hold information on CI’s that  have a varying degree of complexity  from entire  stand-alone systems  e.g. Mainframe  to simple,  single hardware items or software applications and  all the associated relationships that are possible  between them.    An ability to use heuristics to create automatic  relationships between certain components.    Ability to easily add, modify or remove components,  without undermining the database integrity.   Automated validation and duplicate avoidance  e.g.  inability to use a unique identifier more than once    When reviewing changes or incidents the ability to  easily identify components that share a relationship  with the primary CI being reviewed.

Flow through updates on version numbers following  releases, etc.   History section to allow a review of past events to  components  including changes to versions,  installation date, RFC’s, location changes, etc.    Powerful reporting ability, with both pre-defined  reports and the ability to create custom reports. Also  the ability to perform trending analysis to help  facilitate future requirements.   Based on logical divisions of your organization the  ability to display component details by geographic  location or functional department or network  segment, etc.                   Parent Child display     CMDB back-ups, archives and housekeeping  Regular back-ups  combined with secure storage  is an important element of  CMDB design. Many databases can grow to an enormous size. The backup of  such large databases is in itself a skilled practice that must be well thought  out and executed.  Normal backup procedures and practices should apply  e.g. full and  differential backups, offsite storage, testing of recoverability, etc.                Page 102    Configuration Management    Configuration Management naming - Attributes  The following attributes are examples that could be used in the CMDB. Note  that hardware CI types will have different attributes from software CI types.     Description   Attribute      CI Name   Copy or Serial Number   Category   Type   The unique name by which this type of CI is known.     The number that uniquely identifies the particular  instances of this CI - for example, for software the  copy number, for hardware the serial number.    Classification of a CI  e.g. hardware, software,  documentation etc .     Description of CI type, amplifying 'category'  information  e.g. hardware configuration, software  package, hardware device or program module .    Model Number  hardware    Model of CI  corresponding, for example, to supplier's  model number e.g. Dell model xxx, PC aa model yyy .    Warranty expiry date   Date when the supplier's warranty expires for the CI.     Version Number   The version number of the CI.    Location   The location of the CI, e.g. the library or media where  the software CIs reside, the site room where a service  is located.    Owner Responsible   The name and or designation of the owner  responsible for the CI.                         Page 103    Configuration Management    Responsibility Date   Date the above owner became responsible for the CI.   Source supplier   The source of the CI, e.g. developed in-house, bought  in from company xxxxx etc.    License   License number or reference to license agreement     Supply Date   Date when the CI was supplied to the organization.    Accepted Date   Date when the CI was accepted by the organization  as satisfactorily tested.    Status  current    The current status of the CI; e.g. under 'test', 'live',  'archived'.    Status  scheduled    The next scheduled status of the CI  with the date or  indication of the event that will trigger the status  change .    Parent CI s  relationships   The unique CI identifier s  -  name copy number model number  of the 'parent s '  of this CI.    Child CI s  relationships   The unique CI identifier s  of all 'children' of this CI.    Relationships   The relationship of the CI with all CIs other than  'parent' and 'child'  e.g. this CI 'uses' another CI, this  CI 'is connected to' another CI, this CI is 'resident on'  another CI, this CI 'can access' another CI .                               RFC Numbers   The identification number of all RFC’s affecting this  CI.        Page 104                                  Configuration Management    Change Numbers   The identification number of all Change records  affecting this CI.    Problem Numbers   The identification number of all Problem records  affecting this CI.    Incident Numbers   The identification number of all Incident records  affecting this CI.    Service   He service that the CI forms part of the delivery for.   SLA Number or Name   Any specific SLA’s that this CI forms a part of.   UC Number or Name   Any specific UC that this CI forms a part of.   Value - Initial   Initial value of the CI.   Value - Current   Current Value after depreciation.   Security Level   Minimum staff security level for access.   Comment   A comment field to be used for textual narrative; for  example, to provide a description of how this version  of the CI is different from the previous version.          For RFC’s, Change records, package Release records, etc, the names, copy  numbers, model numbers and version numbers of CIs affected by the  Change, and how they are affected, should be recorded in the CMDB. A  reversion path, and the consequences of reversion, should also be recorded.

First steps in communication require the need to answer the question that most people   quite rightly  ask when the IT department suggests a new system, a new way of working.  WHY?    It is here that we need to promote and sell the benefits. However, be cautious of using  generic words.

Always bear in mind the “so what” factor when discussing areas like goals and  objectives. If you cannot honestly and sensibly answer the question “so what” – then you  are not selling the message in a way that is personal to the listener and gets their “buy- in”.

They will be curious  as to why staff have a sudden interest in what they see as their own IT equipment.  Explaining these “intrusive activities” will reduce the surprise  and that will reduce the  resistance to co-operate .    Configuration identification      CIs are the components used to deliver a service. The CIs include software,   hardware, documentation and SLAs       Also identify the relationship between CIs and the attributes for every CI.     Control of CIs      The objective of configuration control is to ensure that only authorised and   identifiable CIs are recorded in the CMDB upon receipt.      Configuration status accounting  Status reports should be produced on a regular basis, listing, for all CIs under control, their  current version and Change history. Status accounting reports on the current, previous and  planned states of the CIs should include:        Unique identifiers of constituent CIs and their current status, e.g. 'under   development', 'under test', 'live'       Configuration baselines, Releases and their status      Latest software item versions and their status for a system baseline application      The person responsible for status change, e.g. from 'under test' to 'live'      Change history audit trail      Open Problems RFCs.

Audits  will be regular. This advice is as much about fore-warning of an audit as it is a chance for  certain elements to change behaviours.    Configuration verification and audit  Service Desk staff, while registering incidents, can do daily verification.  Configuration audits should be considered at the following times:        Shortly after implementation of a new Configuration Management system        Before and after major Changes to the IT infrastructure        Before a software Release or installation to ensure that the environment is as   expected        Following recovery from disasters and after a 'return to normal'  this audit should   be included in contingency plans      At random intervals            At regular intervals   In response to the detection of any unauthorised CI     News about the Configuration Audit and Verification was distributed;            >    >         To:    On:     By:    On:                          Page 113    Configuration Management    Configuration Plan    Costs   Information relating to costs may be a topic that would be held back from general  communication. Failure to convince people of the benefits will mean total rejection of  associated costs. If required, costs fall under several categories:        Personnel – audit verification staff, database management team  Set-up and   ongoing       Accommodation – Physical location  Set-up and ongoing      Software – Tools  Set-up and ongoing      Hardware – Infrastructure  Set-up      Education – Training  Set-up and ongoing      Procedures – external consultants etc.  Set-up      The costs of implementing Configuration Management will be outweighed by the  benefits. For example, many organizations cannot function satisfactorily unless they can  handle a high volume of software and hardware Changes without sacrificing quality.    Without adequate control, organizations are at risk from such things as computer fraud,  inadvertent software corruption, software viruses and other malicious software. The  damage caused by these can be enormous.

This may sound like a bold statement but it is true. As IT professionals we  have  for too long  assumed that we miss out on funds while other functional  areas  e.g. Human resources and other shared services  seem to get all that  they want.  However, the problem is not with them, it’s with US. We are typically poor  salespeople when it comes to putting our case forward.    We try to impress with technical descriptions, rather than talking in a language  that a business person understands.    For example:   We say   We should say   We have to increase IT security controls,  with the implementation of a new firewall.   The network bandwidth is our biggest  bottleneck and we have to go to a  switched local environment.   Two weeks ago our biggest competitor  lost information that is now rumored to  be available on the internet.   The e-mail you send to the other national  managers will take 4 to 6 hours to be  delivered. It used to be 2 to 3 minutes,  but we are now using our computers for  many more tasks.   We are making the changes on Sunday  afternoon. There will be less people  working then.   Changes to the environment are  scheduled for a period of time when we  expect there to be minimal business  impact.    Doesn’t that sound familiar?    To help reinforce this point even further, consider the situation of buying a  new fridge.   What if the technically savvy sales person wants to explain “the intricacies of  the tubing structure used to super cool the high pressure gases, which flow in  an anti-clockwise direction in the Southern hemisphere”.      Page 117    Configuration Management    Wouldn’t you say “too much information, who cares – does it make things  cold?”  Well IT managers need to stop trying to tell business managers about the  tubing structure and just tell them what they are interested in.    So let’s know look at some benefits of Configuration Management. Remember  that the comments here are generic, as they have to apply to any  organization. If you need assistance in writing business benefits for your  organization please e-mail service@theartofservice.com for a quotation.   Benefits   Notes Comments Relevance            The ability to obtain and provide accurate  component information.  The Configuration Management process is a  cornerstone to other ITIL processes.  There are clear links between this process and all  others.  A well run configuration management process will  ensure that the best returns on the investment  made in implementation of structured processes  is achieved.    IT components are relatively expensive and  constitute a valuable part of the organization’s  assets.  Good control over these assets is as important as  good stock control and overall credibility that  comes from knowing what we have and where it  is.    In many industries there can be a legal  requirement to track assets.  Implementing a good CMDB with published  regular verification audits will meet most legal  obligations that may be imposed on  organizations.  This is most easily discussed when reviewing  software licences and the heavy penalties that  can be imposed for illegal use.         Page 118    Configuration Management                      Configuration Management directly contributes  towards the ability of the IT department to keep  providing IT service following a major outage. The  CMDB combined with the DSL helps in the  restoration process, by providing configuration  information and location of spares, etc.    Providing assistance to the ongoing task of rolling  out new releases, new software, and new  applications to the business.  Assistance is via information regarding versions,  previous changes, location of master copies, etc.    Aides in improving the security of the organization  with respect to IT. This is because changes to CIs  can be verified, checked and controlled  helping  to reduce accidental or deliberate changes .    Minimising the amount of “wasted” software, by  ensuring maximum use of software purchased.  A good Configuration Management process  allows us to track our purchases of software  against the numbers of users. This information  may help to redistribute existing software, rather  than simply reacting to a request to purchase.    Configuration Management provides accurate  information regarding the expected environment  that a change will impact.  With this information testers are able to more  accurately predict the likely impact of a change  and therefore work to reduce any adverse impact  of a change.    Problem Management relies on trending  information that will help to identify “repeat  component offenders”. With such information,  combined with model numbers, user information,  etc. we are able to more quickly get to the real  root cause of a problem  using scientific methods,  not instinct .

However, the reader will certainly be reminded of the key topics that have to  be considered.    This document serves as a GUIDE ON SUITABLE KEY PERFORMANCE  INDICATORS  KPIs  and REPORTS FOR MANAGEMENT for the  Configuration Management process. This document provides a basis for  completion within your own organization.    This document contains suggestions regarding the measures that would  be meaningful for this process. The metrics demonstrated are intended  to show the reader the range of metrics that can be used. The message  must also be clear that technology metrics must be heavily  supplemented with non-technical and business focused  metrics KPI’s measures.   This document was;   Prepared by:   On:   On:   And accepted by:          >    >         Page 122                            Configuration Management      Key performance indicators  KPI’s     Continuous improvement requires that each process needs to have a plan  about “how” and “when” to measure its own performance. While there can be  no set guidelines presented for the timing of these reviews; the “how” question  can be answered with metrics and measurements.    With regard to timing of reviews, factors such as resource availability, cost  and “nuisance factor” need to be accounted for. Many initiatives begin with  good intentions to do regular reviews, but these fall away very rapidly.     This is why the process owner must have the conviction to follow through on  assessments and meetings and reviews, etc. If the process manager feels  that reviews are too seldom or too often then the schedule should be changed  to reflect that.     Establishing SMART targets is a key part of good process management.  SMART is an acronym for:     Simple  Measurable  Achievable  Realistic  Time Driven     Metrics help to ensure that the process in question is running effectively.  With regard to CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT the following metrics and  associated targets should be considered:              Page 123    Configuration Management    Key Performance Indicator   Target Value   Time   Frame Notes Who    some   examples   12 per audit   6 per month  3 weeks from  date of RFC  registration, for  minor category  changes  0 for  Production  control   3 for Accounts  5% reduction  on Category 1  calls over First  quarter, next  financial year  Average call  resolution time  to drop from 3  mins. to 2.5  mins. within  next 8 weeks                                   Simple count on number of times that a  configuration does not match held information    The amount of elapsed time that passes from  the approval of a change to the actual  implementation of that change.    The number of components that are identified  as “unauthorized”.   The changing amount of serious incidents,  reported to the Help Desk   Delta in the average time to assess and resolve  Service Desk calls using CMDB information.    Breaches to Service Level Agreement that  occur as a result of poor or missing information  from the closely linked Service Support  functions  Configuration, Release, Problem and  Service Desk .   The number of times that a change results in  increased incidents and problems.    The number of times that a change was not  completed due to insufficient or incorrect  information supplied from the CMDB.   Absolute value count on the amount of times  the CMDB is found to be in error.               Others      Page 124    Configuration Management    Reports for Management    Management reports help identify future trends and allow review of the  “health” of the process. Setting a security level on certain reports may be  appropriate, categorizing the report as Strategic, Operational or Tactical.    The acid test for a relevant report is to have a sound answer to the question;  “What decisions is this report helping management to make?”  Management reports for Configuration Management should include:     Report   Time Frame Notes Who   Expected growth and capacity statistics    Details summaries for non-registered or inaccurately  registered IT components  and the steps taken to correct  the situation    An ability to list information such as the number of  registered Configuration Items, along with their version  details and other information such as category, status,  security level, location, owner, etc.   Backlog details of process activities work outstanding   along with potential negative impact regarding failure to  complete the work in a timely manner  – but also provide  solutions on how the backlog can be cleared.   Simple breakdown of asset categories  e.g. Peripherals   printers, scanners , network equipment  routers, hubs,  switches , servers, PC’s, etc.    Analysis and results of audits completed   The situation regarding the process staffing levels and any  suggestions regarding redistribution, recruitment and  training required.    Human resource reporting including hours worked against  project activity  including weekend after hours work .

The document is not to be considered an extensive plan as its topics have to  be generic enough to suit any reader for any organization.    However, the reader will certainly be reminded of the key topics that have to  be considered for planning and implementation of this process.    Initial planning  When beginning the process planning the following items must be completed:  CHECK   DESCRIPTION   ☺ cid:46  cid:47  or   cid:57  cid:50  or date     Get agreement on the objective  use the ITIL definition , purpose,  scope, and implementation approach  e.g. Internal, outsourced,  hybrid  for the process.    Assign a person to the key role of process manager owner. This  person is responsible for the process and all associated systems.    Conduct a review of activities that would currently be considered  as an activity associated with this process. Make notes and  discuss the “re-usability” of that activity.   Create and gain agreement on a high-level process plan and a  design for any associated process systems. NOTE: the plan need  not be detailed. Too many initiatives get caught up in too much  detail in the planning phase.  KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING.   Review the finances required for the process as a whole and any  associated systems  expenditure including people, software,  hardware, accommodation . Don’t forget that the initial  expenditure may be higher than the ongoing costs. Don’t forget  annual allowances for systems maintenance or customizations to  systems by development staff.    Agree to the policy regarding this process    Page 128                      Configuration Management    Create Strategic statements.    Policy Statement  The policy establishes the “SENSE OF URGENCY” for the process.    It helps us to think clearly about and agree on the reasons WHY effort is put into this  process.    An inability to answer this seemingly simple, but actually complex question is a major  stepping stone towards successful implementation    The most common mistake made is that reasons regarding IT are given as the WHY  we should do this. Reasons like to make our IT department more efficient are far too  generic and don’t focus on the real issue behind why this process is needed.    The statement must leave the reader in no doubt that the benefits of this process will  be far reaching and contribute to the business in a clearly recognizable way.    Objective Statement  When you are describing the end or ultimate goal for a unit of activity that is about to  be undertaken you are outlining the OBJECTIVE for that unit of activity.    Of course the activity may be some actions for just you or a team of people. In either  case, writing down the answer to WHERE will this activity lead me us the  organization is a powerful exercise.    There are many studies that indicate the simple act of putting a statement about the  end result expected onto a piece of paper, then continually referring to it, makes  achieving that end result realistic.    As a tip regarding the development of an objective statement; don’t get caught up in  spending hours on this. Do it quickly and go with your instincts or first thoughts –  BUT THEN, wait a few days and review what you did for another short period of time  and THEN commit to the outcome of the second review as your statement.        Page 129    Configuration Management    Scope Statement  In defining the scope of this process we are answering what activities and what  “information interfaces” does this process have.    Don’t get caught up in trying to be too detailed about the information flow into and out  of this process. What is important is that others realize that information does in fact  flow.    For example, with regard to the CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT process we can  create a simple table such as:  Configuration Management Information flows     Process   ConMgt   Process   Information   to  ChangeMgt   Details of affected CIs for an RFC   ChangeMgt   to  ConMgt   Request for information on RFC  affected CIs   ConMgt   to  ReleaseMgt   ReleaseMgt   to  ConMgt   Current version numbers of  production software   New version numbers for production  software                        ConMgt   to   ProblemMgt   CI attributes for root cause analysis   ProblemMgt   to  ConMgt   Request for CI attributes     Establish Priorities.  There can be a variety of ways to implement this process. For a lot of organizations a   staged implementation may be suitable. For others a “big bang” implementation – due  to absolute equality may be appropriate.    In reality however, we usually look at implementation according to pre-defined priorities.  Consider the following options and then apply a suitable model to your own  organization or case study.   Page 130             Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2           Geographical   Functional   Technology   Service   Servers  Laptops  Printers  etc  etc   Accounts  Administration  Production  etc  etc   SAP  E-mail  Workflow system  etc  etc   Head office  Branch office  Customer site  etc  etc    The priority selection has to be made with other factors in mind, such as competitive  analysis, any legal requirements, desires of “politically powerful influencers”.    Costs  The cost of process implementation is something that must be considered before,  during and after the implementation initiative. The following points and table helps to  frame these considerations:   A variety of symbols have been provided to help you indicate required expenditure,  rising or falling expenditure, level of satisfaction regarding costs in a particular area,  etc.       Personnel  Costs of people for initial design of process,  implementation and ongoing support    cid:57     cid:48     cid:47    During   Initial   Ongoing    cid:46   ☺   cid:47    Accommodation  Costs of housing new staff and any associated new  equipment and space for documents or process related  concepts.   Software  New tools required to support the process and or the  costs of migration from an existing tool or system to the  new one.  Maintenance costs   Hardware  New hardware required to support the process  activities. IT hardware and even new desks for staff.                       Page 131    Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2     Education  Re-education of existing staff to learn new techniques  and or learn to operate new systems.                     Procedures  Development costs associated with filling in the detail of  a process activity. The step-by-step recipe guides for all  involved and even indirectly involved personnel.    In most cases, costs for process implementation have to be budgeted for  or allocated   well in advance of expenditure. Part of this step involves deciding on a charging  mechanism  if any  for the new services to be offered.     Build the team  Each process requires a process owner and in most situations a team of people to  assist.  The Configuration Management process is perhaps the process in the Service  Support set that has the largest amount of initial and on-going activity.    The team size may or may not reflect this. Of course a lot will be dependant on  the timing of the implementation and whether it is to be staged or implemented as  one exercise.    Analyse current, in-use systems    Naturally there are many organizations that have many existing tools and systems that  form part of this process. It is critical to identify these systems and consider their future  role as part of the new process definition.      Page 132    Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2   Notes     Examples of areas to review are:     Area   Power teams   Current formal procedures   Current informal procedures   Current role descriptions   Existing organizational structure   Current infrastructure owners   Existing change management and release  management processes   Spreadsheets, databases and other repositories                              Other…    Configuration Management plans and design  Quite often planning and design activities for Configuration Management are spread  across an organization. For example mainframe environments, networks and desktops  used in multiple locations.  In such distributed cases, or even when infrastructure is centralized, responsibilities can  be delegated to groups that have specialist skills in a technology or platform. This is  especially true when it is not cost effective to train other staff in these specialist areas.  In these cases, the process manager retains responsibility for ensuring that plans and  overall process design is aligned and moving in the correct strategic direction.  Relationships between the plans should be visible so that staff can understand how  their activities fit in context with other planning and designs of the Configuration  Management process.  It is important that each plan cross-references and link to other plans. Especially for  lower-level  more operational  plans that must link to their upper level strategic  “parents”. This ensures that duplication is avoided and plans are aligned and reinforce  each other.  The Configuration Management plans helps to define the scope of Configuration  Management. The plans become the best input for the planning stage.      Page 133    Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2     Examples of areas that may require their own Configuration Plan include:      Application Maintenance     Servers and network     Desktop     Mainframe     Implementation Planning  After base decisions regarding the scope of the process and the overall planning  activities are complete we need to address the actual implementation of the process.  It is unlikely that there will not be some current activity or work being performed that  would fit under the banner of this process.     However, we can provide a comprehensive checklist of points that must be reviewed  and done.    Implementation activities for Configuration Management       Activity   Notes Comments Time   Frame Who   Review current and existing Configuration  Management practices in greater detail. Make sure  you also review current process connections from  these practices to other areas of IT Service Delivery.    Review the ability of existing functions and staff. Can  we “reuse” some of the skills to minimize training,  education and time required for implementation.    Establish the accuracy and relevance of current  configuration data held in local spreadsheets or  databases. As part of this step if any information is  credible document the transition from the current  system to any new system that is selected.    Decide how best to select any vendor that will provide  assistance in this process area  including tools,  external consultancy or assistance to help with initial  high workload during process implementation .                   Page 134    Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2   Establish a selection guideline for the evaluation and  selection of tools required to support this process area   i.e. the CMDB and automated discovery tools .   Purchase and install tools required to support this  process  i.e. the CMDB and automated discovery  tools . Ensure adequate skills transfer and on-going  support is considered if external systems are  selected.   Document the information flows from Configuration  Management to Change Management, Release  Management and other ITIL Service Management  processes.    Establish the CI types, attributes, types of  relationships that will be managed in the CMDB.    Create any required business processes interfaces for  this process that can be provided by the automated  tools  e.g. reporting – frequency, content .    Conduct a detailed test of the selected tools. Make  sure that time is allowed for fixing any detected errors.  Test under different circumstances and think laterally  about different situations that could occur and then  test them.    Ensure that known secure storage areas are available  and able to accommodate what will be held  consider,  fire, theft, heat, humidity, etc.     Document and get agreement on roles,  responsibilities and training plans   Communicate with and provide necessary education  and training for staff that covers the actual importance  of the process and the intricacies of being part of the  process itself.                                An important point to remember is that if this process is to be implemented at the same  time as other processes that it is crucial that both implementation plans and importantly  timing of work is complementary.     Page 135          Configuration Management based on ITIL Version 2     The CMDB and Definitive Software Library  Ideally, we would have no changes to the infrastructure while data is being gathered for  entry into the CMDB. After information is gathered there should be a permanent strong  link between Configuration Management and Change Management.  These two processes, probably more than any share an exceptionally close connection.  An important but often overlooked point is that information regarding Requests for  Change should be kept in the CMDB data store. This way it is easier to make links from  changes to incidents or problems that may arise as a result of the change.  The Release Management  oversees the completion of the Definitive Software Library   DSL . This has to happen at the same time as the CMDB is being filled.  The following issues make it necessary to develop DSL specific procedures:  1.  Fully authorized and licensed software only is accepted into the DSL   2.  Software is protected  security management  in the DSL   3.  Software is only removed or copied by authorized staff.    An important phase of the project is the development of contingency plans in the case  of procedural or system failure.  Even though procedures and systems may have undergone extensive testing and sign- off there should be time allowed for unforeseen “go-live” issues.    Cutover to new processes  Once in operation, it is essential that no new items are added to the IT infrastructure  without proper authority from the Configuration Management process.  This is only possible when communication and interfaces are properly established. This  is one of the key benefits of the ITIL framework  the inter-connection of one process  area to all others .  It may be necessary to develop “penalties” for process breaches. This may be done  ahead of go-live or left until the nature and extent of any breach is understood  to  ensure that we don’t over-react .    Other implementation considerations  In most organizations the rate of Configuration Management implementation should be  a gradual exercise. It may be best to start with specific CIs that are easily recognizable,  but with low business impact.  This allows the team to practice and develop skills and confidence in the entire process.

Data compression is mandatory to manage massive datasets, indexing is fundamental to query them. However, their goals appear as counterposed: the former aims at minimizing data redundancies, whereas the latter augments the dataset with auxiliary information to speed up the query resolution. In this monograph we introduce solutions that overcome this dichotomy. We start by presenting the use of optimization techniques to improve the compression of classical data compression algorithms, then we move to the design of compressed data structures providing fast random access or efficient pattern matching queries on the compressed dataset. These theoretical studies are supported by experimental evidences of their impact in practical scenarios.
