At the  beginning, it sold really great, and then sales started to decrease a little bit. It still sold well enough to reach seven editions by this fall, but there was a subtle decline in copies nevertheless. However, all of this changed drastically at the end of last year—sales went up considerably, as did sales of other titles in the same segment. But how come? One of the reasons is AJAX.The technology itself is not new, but the term is. In February 2005, Jesse James Garrett coined the acronym, and since then, the whole web world seems to have gone crazy. And although AJAX can be explained in a couple of minutes actu- ally, it requires a good knowledge of various aspects of JavaScript.This explains the growing demand for advanced JavaScript content, and also led to the writ- ing of the JavaScript Phrasebook. When we  Damon Jordan, Mark Taber, and I  created the book series in 2005, we wanted to create a kind of pimped-up version of language phrasebooks: Common sentences and expressions are translated into a foreign language—into JavaScript, of course. However, unlike in a regular phrasebook, you will also get explanations alongside the code.Without it, the potential for embarrassing situations is quite high, in any language.   JavaScript Phrasebook  This book is no introduction to JavaScript. Elementary JavaScript features are covered, but we tried to put a great emphasis on intermediary and advanced material as well.The idea behind this phrasebook is that espe- cially if your JavaScript knowledge is rusty, you will find common problems and solutions in this book. So use this book as a reference guide to quickly overcome issues you are facing during development. And explore the book to find some JavaScript features you may not have thought about before. This book is no cookbook with long and inflexible solutions to short problems.The idea was to keep the code snippets as concise as possible so that the approach can be demonstrated; this enables you to adapt the presented technique to your own applica- tions and your specific scenario. In order to make this possible, only the code elements that are vital for the samples to run are shown in this book. Usually, the code consists only of   elements and some other HTML tags to tie everything together. A mod- ern web application should at least try to be XHTML- compliant, but this is not the focus of the elements of this book. We took great care to make the code work on as many browsers as possible. And while Internet Explorer and the various Mozilla flavors  including Firefox  dominate the market, Opera, Safari, and Konqueror also have their share in it. So while the focus of the phrases lies on the first two browser types, incompatibilities or caveats regarding the smaller browsers are noted where appropriate. Speaking of market shares: Only browsers that are still relevant as of today are covered; therefore, Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 are not mentioned at all.  2   Introduction  Code samples to this title and updates can be found at http:  javascript.phrasebook.org . Most listings have the associated filename with them, so you can easily find the right file s  for each phrase. If you have any feedback or have found an error, please let me know! If a phrase you were hoping to find is missing, please let me know. If you think that it should appear in upcoming editions of the book, I’d also appreciate if you’d nominate another phrase that you feel is super- fluous.  These books are small, and there’s only so much space.  The list of potential phrases was much longer than what you are holding in your hands now, so we went through a painful process of eliminating content—and hope that the selection is to your liking. Finally, thank you to a bunch of people who helped make this phrasebook more useful than the famous dictionary in the Monty Python sketch that mapped innocent expressions to vulgar translations: Shelley Johnston set this project up and convinced me to do the original phrasebook  PHP Phrasebook . Damon Jordan also worked on the PHP Phrasebook and served as the editor for this title. Phil Ballard tech-edited this book.Thanks for all your hard work on this! Also, thanks to Judith Stevens-Lemoine, who has been editing “my other” JavaScript book since 1999. I’d like to thank her for giving me permission to write this phrasebook. Looking forward to the eighth edition! Your personal phrasemonger, Christian Wenz  3   This page intentionally left blank    1 JavaScript Basics  This chapter covers some basics regarding JavaScript. It  does not explicitly cover the language syntax itself— this is covered in enough tutorials and books and does not fit into the phrasebook concept. However, funda- mentals such as putting JavaScript code in a page are explained in detail. Also, a bit of JavaScript history and browser war stories are used to get you ready for the phrases to come in the following chapters.  Understanding JavaScript  and Its History  JavaScript is a client-side scripting language—that means a language that runs on the client side, within a web browser.  JavaScript can also be used on the server side and otherwise outside a browser, but this is not of interest for the purpose of this book.  If the browser supports the language, JavaScript grants access to the current page and lets the script determine properties of the client, redirect the user to another page, access cookies, and do much more.   6  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics  The birth of JavaScript was in September 1995, when version 2.0 of the Netscape browser was released, the first version to come with the scripting language. Back then, the name of the language was first Mocha and then, when released, LiveScript; but Netscape made a marketing deal with Sun  creator of Java  and renamed the language to JavaScript in December of that year. The concept received a large following, so Microsoft included JavaScript support from Internet Explorer version 3 onward  mid-1996 . For legal reasons, the Microsoft flavor of the language was called JScript. JScript was more or less compatible with JavaScript, but started to include additional, IE-only features  that—apart from some exceptions—never really caught on . In 1997, the standard ECMAScript  ECMA-262  was published; JavaScript is therefore the first implementa- tion of that standard.The standard itself specifies only the language, but not features of the surrounding hosts  for instance, how to access the current browser win- dow or open a new one . ECMAScript became an ISO norm in 1998. Around 1997 or 1998, the browser war between Netscape and Microsoft reached a climax, with both vendors adding new, incompatible functionality to ver- sion 5 of their browsers.The rest is history: Netscape scrapped the idea of releasing browser version 5 and decided to start all over with Netscape 6, which helped Internet Explorer to expand its market share to over 90%. It took the then-founded Mozilla project several years to come to life again.The very popular Firefox browser was based on Mozilla and started to take market share away from Microsoft.   Setting Up a Test System  7  From the JavaScript point of view, not very much has happened in the past few years. Firefox 1.5, which was released in late 2005, supports the new JavaScript ver- sion 1.6, but changes are rather minimal—and Internet Explorer is far away from supporting that. But with Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2.0 in the foreseeable future  and both already available in a preview ver- sion , it’s an interesting time for a web developer. Other browsers, by the way, support JavaScript as well. Differences are subtle, but still can be extremely annoying when one is developing a browser-agnostic web application. Among the browsers that currently support JavaScript are the following:  n Internet Explorer n Mozilla and all derivates  Firefox, Epiphany,  Camino, Galeon, and so on   n Opera n Konqueror n Safari  Setting Up a Test System As just mentioned, several browsers do support JavaScript. Usually, you have to support most of them. For instance, the website http:  marketshare.hitslink. com report.aspx?qprid=3 shows that in March 2006, Internet Explorer and Firefox together accounted for close to 95% of the browser market share, with Safari following  slightly over 3% . Netscape browsers held about 1% and Opera had about half a percent, which was about the same as all other browsers  including Konqueror  had together.   8  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics  So what is the best strategy to test a website on as many systems as possible, but with the least effort? It really depends on what the audience of your website is. If you have a really high portion of Mac users, you do have to do extensive testing with the Safari brows- er, since this browser comes by default with recent versions of Mac OS X. No matter which kind of website you are using, Internet Explorer still has a very strong market share, even on more open-source–centric websites. Therefore, you need Internet Explorer, and thus a Windows system is required for testing  or at least something like Virtual PC or VMware with a Windows virtual machine . All Mozilla browsers share the same codebase for rendering and also for JavaScript, and therefore it does not really matter which platform you are using  albeit there are some minimal differences . So you could, for instance, use Firefox on the same Windows machine your Internet Explorer installation resides on. Opera runs under Windows  and a couple of other systems, including Linux and Mac  as well, so the Windows partition gets one more browser. The only two major browsers now remaining are Safari and Konqueror, the latter one being the default browser when the KDE window manager is used. Luckily, they both share the same codebase, more or less: Safari uses the KHTML engine that is the heart of the Konqueror rendering.Therefore, two options come to mind:  n Set up a Linux box  or a Linux virtual machine   with KDE and Konqueror.   Configuring Web Browsers  9  n Set up a Mac system  or buy an Intel Mac with  BootCamp to dual-boot Windows and OS X   This should at least give you a good system to start testing with.The larger the website gets, the more important it is to support as many target systems as possible; from a certain point on, you will have no other choice than to install and test on every browser you want to support. Regarding Internet Explorer, currently version 6 is the major one, whereas version 5.x is almost extinct and versions 4 and earlier are long gone.Therefore, just testing in IE 6 is acceptable in most cases. Having dif- ferent versions to test is of course quite desirable, but usually requires one Windows system each, since only one IE installation per system is allowed. By accident, a solution for parallel installing several IE versions was found.You can find the original descrip- tion of that on http:  labs.insert-title.com labs  Multiple-IEs-in-Windows_article795.aspx and more information at http:  www.positioniseverything.net  articles multiIE.html. Finally, make sure that you test your website s  with JavaScript both enabled and disabled in browsers.  Configuring Web Browsers By default, most JavaScript-capable web browsers do support JavaScript. Actually, the very first Netscape ver- sion to support JavaScript did not even have a feature to turn it off! However, JavaScript can be turned off, so you should find out how to simulate that  and how to instruct   10  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics  users just to turn it on .This depends not only on the browsers used, but sometimes also on the browser ver- sion. In Firefox 1.5 browsers, JavaScript can be enabled using Tools, Options, Content, Enable JavaScript. In Internet Explorer 6 you have to dig a little bit deeper: Tools, Internet Options, Security, Internet Zone, Custom Level, Scripting, Active Scripting, Enable.  TIP: Internet Explorer versions 6.0 and 7.0  on Windows XP, 2003, and Vista only  has a security feature that blocks JavaScript running on local pages  see Figure 1.1 . This is quite useful actually, but it can be quite annoying when you’re testing an application. There are two workarounds: Either use a local web server to test your application, or just deactivate the error message, by choosing Tools, Internet Options, Advanced, Security, Allow active content to run in files from My Computer.  Figure 1.1 A rather annoying error message  with JavaScript on local pages.   Including JavaScript Code  11  Including JavaScript Code     window.alert “Welcome to JavaScript!” ;     JavaScript code can come in two ways: either embed- ded into an HTML page, or in an external file.The most common way to include JavaScript code is to use the   element.You can place this element any- where, and the code is then executed after this part of the HTML page has been loaded and parsed.The pre- ceding code  file script.html in the download archive  opens a modal window and prints some rather simple text. The type attribute provides the MIME type for JavaScript. Previously, language="JavaScript" was used; however, since that was not standardized, it is consid- ered best practice to use type and the MIME type instead. In this book, we follow the approach many websites are using nowadays: Both type and language are used. Also, back in the old days, it was possible to target a script to a specific version number of JavaScript, like this:     window.alert "Only with JavaScript 1.6!" ;     However, this is almost never used now. First of all, implementation of this feature has been quite buggy in browsers, and there are better ways of testing a browser’s JavaScript capabilities.   12  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics  NOTE: In some old tutorials you will find the advice to use HTML comments in the following fashion:   <!--     ...    -->   NOTE: This was previously used to cope with browsers that did not know anything of JavaScript. However, even browsers that do not support JavaScript know about the   element and know to ignore it  including its contents . Therefore, these HTML comments are not neces- sary any longer.  Using External JavaScript Files  <script language="JavaScript" type="text javascript"  src="script.js">   Especially when you are reusing JavaScript code on your website, an external JavaScript file  or several files  comes in handy.This external file contains only the JavaScript code, no   elements. A   ele- ment is, however, used to load the external file, as can be seen from the previous listing  file scriptsrc. html .The src attribute holds the URL of the external script; absolute URLs  and, therefore, remote servers  are also possible.  WARNING: Note that the code in the external file is avail- able only after the external file has been fully loaded. So especially when calling functionality in the external file from the local page, keep in mind that the external file may not be available yet.   Dynamically Loading JavaScript Files  13  Dynamically Loading JavaScript Files  var s = document.createElement "script" ;  Sometimes it is necessary to load JavaScript code on demand, while a site is running. For instance, depend- ing on user input, a specific external JavaScript file must be loaded. One attempt is to use document.write   to dynamically add a new   element to the page. However, this fails with some browsers and also is not considered good style. A much better solution is to use DOM. First, you create a new   element and set the appropriate attributes.Then, you add this element to the page’s DOM  see Chapter 5 . Usually, the code is put in the   section of the page.The following listing shows the complete code; note that there actu- ally is a   element so that the code works. Figure 1.2 shows the result of this code.       JavaScript      <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript"> var s = document.createElement "script" ; s.setAttribute "type", "text javascript" ; s.setAttribute "language", "JavaScript" ; s.setAttribute "src", "script.js" ; document.getElementsByTagName "head" [0]   cid:1 .appendChild s ;   14  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics         Dynamically Adding a Script  scriptdynamic.html   Figure 1.2  The modal window comes from the  external file that was dynamically loaded.  Using JavaScript Pseudo URLs  <a href="javascript:window.alert 'Welcome to JavaScript!' ;">click here for a surprise   Another way to call JavaScript code is to use a pseudo URL.When a URL that begins with javascript: is loaded, the code behind that is executed, as can be seen in the preceding code  file url.html . There are several ways to use such a URL—in the form of an image, a link, or a CSS style—but usually it’s the link you will want to use. Note, however, that such a link obviously works only with a browser that supports JavaScript and has it activated.   Executing JavaScript with Event Handlers  15  WARNING: When the code after the javascript: URL prefix returns something, the result is printed to the screen. Usually, this is not desirable. You can use the special JavaScript function void   to avoid this: javascript:void code_that_would_return_something   ;  Executing JavaScript with Event Handlers     The third way to execute JavaScript code  the first two ones being   elements and javascript: pseudo URLs  is via en event handler. Most HTML elements support a few events; for instance, the   tag sup- ports the load element. Using the on prefix, code can be attached to this event  more options are covered in Chapter 6,“OOP and Events” .Therefore, the follow- ing code runs the showText   function after the docu- ment has been fully loaded  with respect to the HTML markup of the page, not images or other external data :       JavaScript  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript"> function showText   {  }       window.alert "Welcome to JavaScript!" ;   16  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics         Using a JavaScript Event Handler  event.html   WARNING: It is a common misconception that the javascript: URL prefix must be used with event handlers, in the following fashion:    However, this is completely bogus—what else if not JavaScript code could be the value of an event handler attribute? Therefore, omit the javascript: and just pro- vide the code to be executed when the associated event is fired.  Coping with Browsers without JavaScript     document.write "Welcome to JavaScript!" ;          Welcome to plain HTML!  According to recent surveys, up to 10% of users have JavaScript disabled, due to company policies, fear of browser security vulnerabilities, and other reasons. Therefore, you do have to make sure that your website can be used without JavaScript, as well.   Coping with Browsers without JavaScript  17  One way to achieve this is to use the   ele- ment. Browsers with activated JavaScript ignore this element and its contents, whereas browsers without JavaScript show the element’s contents.The preceding code  file noscript.html  generates the output shown in Figure 1.3 when a non-JavaScript browser  like the text browser Lynx  is used; Figure 1.4 shows a browser that supports the scripting language.  Figure 1.3 The preceding code in a browser  without JavaScript.  Figure 1.4 The preceding code in a browser  with JavaScript.   18  CHAPTER 1  JavaScript Basics  When JavaScript is used together with links, the fol- lowing does not work fully as expected:  <a href="" onclick="window.alert 'Welcome to  JavaScript!' ; ">click here   At first sight, we did everything right: Users with JavaScript get the modal window, users without JavaScript just click on a link to an empty text label; so nothing unexpected happens. However, there is one little disadvantage: After the JavaScript link is clicked, a JavaScript-enabled browser shows the window but then still follows the link. Usually, that does not have an effect, but the browser scrolls to the top of the page because the text label has not been found. To avoid this, just make sure that the code in the event handler returns false.This cancels all other effects the current event may have; in this case, the link will not be followed:  <a href="" onclick="window.alert 'Welcome to  JavaScript!' ; return false;">click here   Avoiding that JavaScript-Enabled Browsers Still Follow the Link  link.html    2 Common Phrases  There are some recurring JavaScript tasks you need to  perform almost daily.They build the foundation of many JavaScript applications and do not fit into any specific category.Therefore, this chapter starts with a collection of common problems—and solutions.  Detecting the Browser Type  window.alert navigator.appName ;  Although browsers’ implementations of JavaScript are quite compatible with each other nowadays  especially when compared with the situation during the browser war at the end of the 1990s , detecting the browser type is a vital part of the JavaScript developer’s toolbox. The navigator JavaScript object provides browser information. Most useful, but also sometimes challeng- ing to parse, is its userAgent property, which contains the complete browser identification string that is also sent in the HTTP User-Agent header with each request.   20  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  To just determine the browser type, the appName prop- erty suffices, as the preceding code shows.Table 2.1 contains the appName values for the most relevant browsers.  The appName Values for Various Browsers  Table 2.1 Browser Internet Explorer Mozilla Browsers Konqueror  KDE  Apple Safari Opera Browser  appName  Netscape  Konqueror  Netscape  Opera  Microsoft Internet Explorer  So as you can see, the Safari browser returns the incor- rect name.To mitigate this effect, you can search navigator.userAgent for certain browser types. Since the Opera browser can identify itself as another browser  but then still mentions "Opera" in navigator. userAgent , this browser has to be checked first.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  var uA = navigator.userAgent; var browserType = "unknown"; if  uA.indexOf "Opera"  > -1  {  browserType = "Opera";  } else if  uA.indexOf "Safari"  > -1  {  browserType = "Safari";  } else if  uA.indexOf "Konqueror"  > -1  {  browserType = "Konqueror";  } else if  uA.indexOf "Gecko"  > -1  {  browserType = "Mozilla";  } else if  uA.indexOf "MSIE"  > -1  {   Detecting the Browser Type  21  browserType = "Internet Explorer";  } window.alert browserType ;    Determining the Browser Type  browser.html   With a little bit of effort, this script can be extended to distinguish the Mozilla derivatives  Firefox, Epiphany, Galeon, Camino, SeaMonkey, and so on  as well.  Detecting the Browser Version Number  To determine the browser’s version number, several approaches exist. Most of the time, you have a look at navigator.userAgent, which can look like the following:  Mozilla 5.0  Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en;  rv:1.8.0.3  Gecko 20060426 Firefox 1.5.0.3 Mozilla 5.0  Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;  rv:1.4  Gecko 20030619 Netscape 7.1  ax   Mozilla 4.0  compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;  SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727   Mozilla 5.0  compatible; Konqueror 3.4; FreeBSD   KHTML 3.4.2  like Gecko   Mozilla 5.0  Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en   AppleWebKit 418  KHTML, like Gecko  Safari 417.9.3  Mozilla 5.0  Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en   AppleWebKit 312.8  KHTML, like Gecko  Safari 312.6  Opera 9.00  Windows NT 5.1; U; en  Mozilla 4.0  compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1;  en  Opera 9.00   22  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  So as you can see, depending on the browser type, the version number is buried somewhere else within the value of navigator.userAgent.Therefore, it is a tedious task to cover all possible browsers and to keep on track with new methods. However, there are some web resources that implement a quite decent browser detection.You will find more documentation and code on these websites:  n http:  www.webreference.com tools browser   javascript.html  n http:  gemal.dk browserspy basic.html  Checking Browser Capabilities  if  document.getElementById  {     ...  } As you could see from the previous examples, relying on browser version numbers is not only difficult, but also not future-proof. A much better way to check whether a browser supports the features your applica- tion requires is to specifically check for the support of the special objects. For instance, to use DOM  see Chapter 5,“DOM and DHTML” , you might want to try the preceding code. If the getElementById   method is implemented, document.getElementById  without parentheses  returns a reference to the function. If used within a condition, this evaluates to true.Therefore, the associated code is executed. Another example: Internet Explorer supports ActiveX objects for certain applications, for instance XML   Redirecting the Browser  23  support. However, only the Windows versions of IE know ActiveX—the Mac versions don’t. So specifically checking for Internet Explorer creates problems for Mac users. If you specifically check for the ActiveX support, you avoid these issues:  if  window.ActiveXObject  {     ...  }  Preventing Caching  document.write "<img src=\"image.png?" +   Math.random   + "\"  >" ;  Using server-side headers, the caching of dynamic content-like images and also HTML pages can be avoided. However, this approach is not bulletproof, since some browsers or proxy servers can ignore these settings. A technique that always works is appending a meaningless query string parameter to the URL, as in the following fashion: Math.random   returns a random number between 0 and 1, for instance 0.1296601696732852. Appending this to an image usually does not change the data sent from the server, but it is a completely new request for the browser.Therefore, the image  or other data  is not cached.  Redirecting the Browser  location.href = "newPage.html";  The location.href property allows read and write access to the URL of the current page. Consequence:   24  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  Setting location.href to another value redirects the browser, which then loads the new page, as the preced- ing code shows.  TIP: This can also be done by HTML means:    The placeholder X stands for the number of seconds to wait until the new page is loaded; Y denotes the new URL.  The previous page then lands in the history of the browser. If you however want to replace the old page in the browser history  to make the back button not work as expected here , use the location.replace   method:  location.replace "newPage.html" ;  Reloading the Page  location.reload  ;  The reload   method of the location object reloads the current page, which is equivalent to location.href = location.href. If you provide true as a parameter, caching is disabled and the browser does a “hard” reload from the server. However, this is also not bullet- proof, since there could be a proxy server in between that could have a cached copy of the requested page. So you could use the “Preventing Caching” phrase technique from this chapter instead:  location.search = "?" + Math.random  ;  This changes the query string  location.search  of the current page, effectively reloading the URL reload   .   Date and Time Information  25  Creating a Random Number  var rand = min + Math.floor  max – min + 1  *   Math.random   ;  The random   method of the Math object calculates a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1  excluding . However, usually you are interested in a random num- ber between, say, 1 and 10.With a small mathematical calculation, this can be achieved. For the example, multiply the result of Math.random   by 10, effectively generating a number between 0 and 10  excluding . If you then round this value, you get an integral number between 0 and 9  including . Adding 1 leads to a num- ber between 1 and 10. The preceding code generalizes this and creates a number between min and max.  Date and Time Information  var d = new Date  ; var mdy =  d.getMonth  +1  + " " + d.getDate   +     “ ” + d.getFullYear  ; JavaScript’s Date object provides access to the current date and is also capable of doing certain Date calcula- tions  using the epoch value, the number of milli- seconds since January 1, 1970 .Table 2.2 contains the most important methods of the Date class.The preced- ing code creates a date in the format month day year.   26  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  Some Date Properties  Table 2.2 Method  getDate    getFullYear    getHours    getMinutes    getMonth    getSeconds    getTime    toString    toUTCString    Description Day of the month Four-digit year Hours Minutes Month minus 1  !

A pattern in a regular expression contains a string that can be searched for in a larger string. However, this can also be done  faster  using indexOf  .The advantage of regular expressions is that some special features such as wildcards are avail- able.Table 2.3 shows some special characters and their meanings.  Table 2.3 Special Character  ^  $  Special Characters in Regular Expressions  Description Beginning of the string End of the string  Example ^a means a string that starts with a a$ means a string that ends with a   Date and Time Information  27  Special Character  ?  *  +  [...]  -  used within square brackets  ^  used within  square brackets    Description 0 or 1 times  refers to the previous character or expression  0 or more times  refers to the  previous character or expression  1 or more times  refers to the  previous character or expression  Alternative characters A sequence of values  Does match anything but the following characters Alternative patterns   ...   Defines a subpattern  Example ab? means a or ab  ab* means a or ab or abb or…  ab+ means ab or abb or abbb or…  PHP[45] means PHP4 or PHP5 ECMAScript [3-5] means ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 4 or ECMAScript 5 [^A-C] means D or E or F or…  ECMAScript 3ECMAScript 4 means ECMAScript 3 or ECMAScript 4, as does ECMAScript  34   a  b  means ab, but with two sub- patterns  a and b    28  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  Table 2.3 Continued Special Character  Description Any character  {min, max} Minimum and  .  \  Example . means a, b, c, 0, 1, 2, $, ^,… a{1,3} means a, aa, or aaa. a{,3} means empty string, a, aa, or aaa. a{1,} means a, aa, aaa,… \. stands for .  maximum number of occurrences; if either min or max is omitted, it means 0 or infinite escapes the following character  Other special characters and expressions are available, for instance, a character that refers to a digit  \d .  Searching with Regular Expressions  zip.test "Indianapolis, IN 46240" ;  Defining a regular expression in JavaScript can be done in two ways:  n var zip = new RegEx "\\d{5}" ;  n var zip =  \d{5} ;  There is no functional difference between the two approaches; you just have to take character escaping into account.Then, the test   method of the expres- sion checks whether a string contains the regular expression:   Replacing Text  29  var found = zip.test "Indianapolis, IN 46240" ;   true  If you are interested in the actual match, use the exec   function.The method returns an array. Its first array element is the whole match, and the next ele- ments are all submatches  if parentheses are used in the regular expression .  var matches = zip.exec "Indianapolis, IN 46240" ;     ["46240"]  TIP: The method match   returns all matches; exec   returns only the current match, usually the first one. However, if you call exec   multiple times, all matches are returned.  Replacing Text  var address =   \w+ ,  [A-Z]{2}   \d{5}  ; var sams = "Indianapolis, IN 46240"; var result = sams.replace address, "$3 $1, $2" ;  The replace   method every JavaScript string supports can replace text. It searches for a regular expression and replaces the match with another string.Within this replacement string, you can back-reference sub- matches. $0 points to the first match, $1 references the first submatch  within parentheses , $2 the second sub- match, and so on.The preceding code searches for the city, state, and zip code elements and then rearranges them.The result is "46240 Indianapolis, IN".   30  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  Navigating within the Browser’s History  window.history.back  ; window.history.forward  ;  The browser history is represented by the history object  a property of the window object  and contains a list of web pages visited prior to  and, if available, after  the current page. And although it is technically possi- ble to move a couple of elements within the history, security constraints leave only one viable way: going one page back and one page forward.The following two methods implement that:  n back   moves to the previous page in the history   like the back button does .  n forward   moves to the next page in the history   like the forward button does .  Displaying the Modification Date of the Page  document.write document.lastModified ;  Whenever a web server sends a resource to the client, it also sends the date the document was modified the last time. Usually, the web server takes this information from the file system, but this header can also be modi- fied or just not sent. But anyway, you can use this information, for instance as shown in the preceding code.Therefore, you can have a more or less realistic modification date on your page.   Retrieving GET Parameters  31  Retrieving GET Parameters  var ls = location.search.substring 1 ; var namevalue = ls.split “&” ;  Usually, GET information is evaluated on the server side, but JavaScript does also have access to this infor- mation via its location.search property. However, the data there is in name-value pairs.The following code decodes this data by using the JavaScript split   method.The resulting associative array is then shown, just to prove that it works as expected; see Figure 2.1 for the output.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  var getdata = []; if  location.search.length > 1  {  var ls = location.search.substring 1 ; var namevalue = ls.split "&" ; for  var i=0; i<namevalue.length; i++  {  var data = namevalue[i].split "=" ; getdata[data[0]] = data[1];  }  }  } alert s ;    var s = ""; for  var el in getdata  {  s += el + ": " + getdata… + "\n";  Parsing the Query String  querystring.html    32  CHAPTER 2  Common Phrases  Figure 2.1 The data from the query string  is parsed and shown.  Asking for User Confirmation  <a href="anyPage.html"   onclick="return window.confirm 'Do you really want  to do this?' ;">Click here   JavaScript offers limited support for modal windows. The window.alert   method is fairly common, but there are other options as well.With window.confirm  , the user is presented with a Yes No window. If Yes is clicked, window.confirm   returns true; otherwise, false.The preceding code  file confirm.html  uses this as the return value for a link, so if No is clicked, the link is not followed.  WARNING: Note that this dialog is translated by browsers, so you should avoid text like “Click Yes to…” since users with a non-English system do not have a Yes button.  Asking for User Data  var name =   window.prompt "Enter your name!", " " ;   Asking for User Data  33  The window.prompt   method allows users to enter text into a single-line text field  see Figure 2.2 .This infor- mation is the return value of the method call and can be further used in the script.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  var name =   window.prompt "Enter your name!", " " ;  if  name != null  {  window.alert "Hello, " + name + "!" ;  }    Prompting for User Data  prompt.html   Figure 2.2 The input box generated  by window.prompt  .  NOTE: Do note that if the Cancel button is clicked or the Esc key is pressed, window.prompt   returns null. The preceding code checks that; if the OK button is pressed, the data entered is shown.   This page intentionally left blank    3 Images and Animations  In the early days of the Web, one of the first effects  done with JavaScript was image manipulation. A classi- cal example was hover images: Hover the mouse pointer over an image and its appearance changes. Netscape introduced JavaScript access for images in browser version 3. At that time, Internet Explorer 3 for Windows was in beta, so it was too late for this capa- bility. However, Internet Explorer 3 for Macintosh was released after the Windows version, giving the Microsoft engineers enough time to add JavaScript image access to IE Mac. Beginning with IE 4, the Microsoft browser can access images as well, as do all other relevant browsers. This allows not only nice graphical effects but also more sophisticated applications such as image slide shows.   36  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  Creating Mouseover Buttons  <img src="inactive.gif"  onmouseover="this.src='active.gif';" onmouseover="this.src='inactive.gif';"  >  One of the oldest effects in the World Wide Web con- sists of graphics that change their appearance when the mouse moves  hovers  over them.This is also called a “hover effect” or a “hover button” “hover graphic.” The name, by the way, is also reflected in the nonstan- dard hover pseudo CSS class some browsers support. To change a graphic, you have to access it and then change its src property. Browsers support several methods of accessing graphics.The following ones work consistently across modern browsers:  n Set the image’s name attribute, and access it via  document.images["name"].  n Set the image’s name attribute, and access it via  document.images.name  however, then some special characters like blanks or dashes are not possible in the name attribute .  n Access the image using its position on the page, via the document.images array: document.images[0] for the first image, document.images[1] for the sec- ond image, and so forth.  n Set the image’s id attribute, and access it via  document.getElementById "id" .  The appropriate event for the mouse moving over the image is mouseover, and when mouseout occurs, you should reset the image to its original state.The preced- ing code does this and puts everything in the   element, but you could also use a generic custom   Creating Mouseover Buttons  37  JavaScript function for doing so.The following code creates a function that expects the image’s name and its URL in a function and then calls this using onmouseover onmouseout:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function changeImage name, url  {  if  document.images[name]  {  document.images[name].src = url;  }  }   <img  name="myImage" src="inactive.gif" onmouseover="changeImage 'myImage',   cid:1 'active.gif' ;"  onmouseout="changeImage 'myImage',   cid:1 'inactive.gif' ;"  >  A Hover Button  hover.html   Figure 3.1 shows two buttons; the mouse pointer is over the one on the right, demonstrating both states of the button.  WARNING: Older browsers  including Netscape 4.x  do not support onmouseover onmouseout for anything other than links. In that case, you have to embed the image within an HTML link and use onmouseover onmouseout in the   tag: <a  href="" onmouseover="..." onmouseout="">        38  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  Figure 3.1 The buttons change their appearance  when the mouse hovers over them.  Preloading Images  var i = new Image  ; i.src = "";  Although the mouseover effect from the previous phrase is easy to implement and nice to look at, it still has a structural flaw: After the mouse pointer moves over an image, the replacement graphic is loaded from the server.This leads to a certain latency and a possible negative user experience. Therefore, it is desirable to preload these images after the page itself has been loaded.With JavaScript, you can instruct the browser to load the images.Then they are in the browser’s cache  unless caching is disabled in the browser or the web server sends HTTP headers forbidding local caching  and load instantly when the hover effect is triggered. To achieve this effect, you have to instantiate the JavaScript Image object and set its src property.   Preloading Images  39  This loads the image in the background, without even displaying it.You just have to make sure that the pre- loading is executed when the HTML page has been fully loaded, as the following listing shows:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function preloadImage url  {  var i = new Image  ; i.src = url;  }        Preloading Images  preload.html   If several images have to be preloaded at once  for instance, if the whole navigation uses a hover effect , a more generic function accepting an array with images can be used:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function preloadImages urls  {  var img = new Array  ; for  var i=0; i<urls.length; i++  {  img[img.length] = new Image  ; img[img.length - 1].src = urls[i];  }  }  window.onload = function   {  var img = new Array   "active.gif", "inactive.gif", "other.gif" ;   40  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  preloadImages img ;  }    Preloading Multiple Images  preload-array.html   TIP: With standard HTML, you can preload images, as well, without having to display them:              However, when you need these images only for JavaScript effects, you should only preload them using JavaScript. Otherwise, users without JavaScript would preload the files, as well—without seeing the visual  JavaScript  effects.  Animating Graphics  document.images["animation"].src = urls[pos]; window.setTimeout "animate " +  pos + 1  + " ;",   500 ;  The GIF file format, originally from CompuServe, is the only graphics format that supports animation and is supported by all popular browsers. However, it also has some severe limitations, most annoyingly the 8-bit color palette that allows only 256 colors to be used. So PNG-24 is the way to go, but unfortunately this for- mat does not have animation capabilities.   Animating Graphics  41  In this case, JavaScript is the way to go. Changing a graphic is possible as shown in the preceding phrases, and the only ingredient missing is the use of setInterval   or setTimeout  .The following code iterates through an array of images and moves to the next image after 500 milliseconds  half a second  have elapsed:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  var urls;  function animate pos  {  pos %= urls.length; document.images["animation"].src = urls[pos]; window.setTimeout "animate " +  pos + 1  + " ;",   500 ;  }  window.onload = function   {  urls = new Array   "0.png", "1.png", "2.png", "3.png",  "4.png", "5.png", "6.png" ;  animate 0 ;  }      Animating Through Images  animate.html   The animate   function expects one parameter: the position of the next image to show.The list of images to iterate through is saved in a global variable, since setTimeout   cannot use local variables that are not available in the global scope.   42  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  With pos %= urls.length, the pointer to the image list is set to the beginning after the last image has been shown, effectively generating an infinite loop. If you want the animation to end after the last image, replace this line with the following code:  if  pos == urls.length  {  return false;  }  Stretching Graphics  document.images["bar"].width += 5;  Sometimes it is not even necessary to create several graphics to build an animation. Sometimes just stretch- ing an image can create a nifty effect. Usually, this does not fare too well on the Web, since only bitmap file formats are supported  except for Flash or SVG, which is not available across browsers in their default setup . Therefore, stretching a graphic instructs the browser to calculate additional image information. Usually, this is done by copying pixels. In the case of a progress bar, a simple graphic can suf- fice. In a simple example, use a 1×1-pixel image. If it is used in the HTML page with a width of 20 pixels and a height of 10 pixels, you get a 20×10-pixel image. By animating the width of the image with JavaScript, you can get the impression of a moving progress bar. The width and height of an image can be accessed from JavaScript using the width and height properties, both readable and writable.The following code moves the progress bar, using a simple 1×1-pixel graphic, black.gif.   Stretching Graphics  43  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function progress   {  if  document.images["bar"].width < 200  {  document.images["bar"].width += 5; document.images["bar"].height = 5;  } else {  clearInterval ID ;  }  }  var ID; window.onload = function   {  ID = setInterval "progress  ;", 500 ;  }      An Animated Progress Bar  progress.html   Figure 3.2 shows the example in action:The 1×1 image has been stretched dynamically by JavaScript. The progress   function is called every 500 millisec- ond, thanks to the setInterval   call. After the progess bar has reached its maximum length  in this example, arbitrarily 200 pixels , the animation is stopped with clearInterval  .  Figure 3.2 The graphic is animated so that  it looks like a progress bar.   44  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  WARNING: If you do not explicitly set the height of the progress bar image, stretching its width also stretches the height, ruining the desired effect.  Visualizing the Page Loading State with a Progress Bar  if  document.images[i].complete  {  loaded++;  }  Whether or not a page has been completely loaded cannot be determined by JavaScript alone, but at least it can be sufficiently estimated.The complete property of an image provides a Boolean value telling whether the image has been completely loaded. Also, an image supports the load event, so onload can be used to trig- ger code execution after the image has been loaded. The following code iterates through all images on the page and counts how many of them have been com- pletely loaded.This generates an estimated percentage of how much of the page has been fully loaded.  Of course, not included are applets and embedded media; also, the image file sizes are not taken into account.   <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript"> function showprogress   {  if  document.images.length == 0  {  return false;   } var loaded = 0; for  var i=0; i<document.images.length; i++  {   Visualizing the Page Loading State with a Progress Bar  45  if  document.images[i].complete  {  loaded++;  }  } var percentage = Math.round   100 * loaded   document.images.length ;  document.getElementById "progress" .innerHTML =   percentage + "% loaded";  if  percentage == 100  {  window.clearInterval ID ;  }  }  var ID = window.setInterval "showprogress  ;", 500 ;    0% loaded   The Loading Progress Bar  loadprogress.html   In order to actually reproduce this effect, you have to embed images in your page that take quite long to load, either because they are really large or because the server is under a heavy load.The code downloads for this book include the PHP script gfx.php that relies on PHP’s GD extension and creates a randomly colored image with a time delay of up to 15 seconds. Figure 3.3 shows the result when two out of three graphics have been loaded.  NOTE: Other interesting events for images are abort  when the loading of the image is aborted by the user  and error  when there is an error loading the image, for instance, when the file does not exist . They can be used with the onabort and onerror event handlers.   46  CHAPTER 3  Images and Animations  Figure 3.3 The third graphic is still loading.  Using Image Maps  JavaScript can also be used within client-side image maps, but only in relatively few scenarios:  n Every link in the image map can be a javascript:  link, thus enabling the browser to call JavaScript when the user clicks on a hotspot in the map.  n Events like mouseover, mouseout, and load are also available within image maps for shapes defined in the   element.  n The image map associated with an image can be  set via JavaScript, using the useMap property. However, usually there is only one image map suitable for one image.   4 CSS  In the early days of the World Wide Web, content was  king, the layout rather irrelevant.Then, the Web started to commercialize, and web developers started abusing HTML, which somehow transformed from the markup language it became to an inadequate design tool.With CSS  Cascading Style Sheets , the situation became quite a bit better, since it allowed styling the contents of an HTML page—HTML was a markup language again, defining the content and the structure of a page, but not necessarily how it looked. Using JavaScript, CSS effects can be applied on the fly. Most of the phrases in this chapter are very generic in nature so that you can apply these techniques to any CSS design challenges you may face. Some phrases, however, solve very specific problems.   48  CHAPTER 4  CSS  Accessing CSS Styles  document.getElementById "para" .style.fontWeight =   "strong";  JavaScript can set any CSS commands and is “almost” using the name of the CSS command as the JavaScript property. However, there is a problem: Some charac- ters, like the dash, are not allowed within a JavaScript property. But many CSS commands like, for instance, font-weight, do have dashes in them.Therefore, the JavaScript language uses a lowerCamelCase syntax: Every component starts with an uppercase letter, but not the very first one. So the CSS command font-weight can be set using the fontWeight property. All CSS commands may be accessed using the style property of every styleable HTML element on the page.There are two common ways to access these elements:  n Using event handlers in the form of HTML attributes, and submitting a reference to the current element as the parameter: <p onmouseover= "handlerFunction this ;"  >.  n Accessing the element using document.  getElementById  .  The following listing shows the latter approach.The   element is selected using document.getElementById  ; then the font-weight CSS command is set:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function makeBold   {   Accessing CSS Styles  49  document.getElementById "para" .style.fontWeight =  "bold";  window.setTimeout "makeLighter  ;", 1000 ;  function makeLighter   {  document.getElementById "para" .style.fontWeight =  "lighter";  window.setTimeout "makeBold  ;", 1000 ;  }  }  window.onload = makeBold;    CSS and JavaScript   Changing a CSS Command  style.html   TIP: When a Mozilla browser is used, the JavaScript con- sole also shows an error when an invalid value for the chosen style will be applied, as Figure 4.1 shows. This is extremely convenient when you’re debugging.  Figure 4.1 Mozilla browsers  here: Firefox  complain  about invalid CSS values.   50  CHAPTER 4  CSS  Accessing CSS Classes  document.getElementById "para" .className =   "strong";  The most commonly used way to apply CSS to an HTML page is by using classes.With JavaScript, the class for every element can be accessed with the className property.The following code implements the preceding phrase with the class approach:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function makeBold   {  document.getElementById "para" .className =   "strong";  window.setTimeout "makeLighter  ;", 1000 ;  function makeLighter   {  document.getElementById "para" .className =   "weak";  window.setTimeout "makeBold  ;", 1000 ;  }  }  window.onload = makeBold;      .strong { font-weight: bold; } .weak { font-weight: lighter; }     CSS and JavaScript   Changing the CSS Class  classname.html   The preceding code changes the class for the text every second.   Accessing Individual Style Sheets  51  Accessing Individual Style Sheets  document.styleSheets[0].disabled = true;  When a page consists of more than one style sheet    element with an inline style, or an external style sheet , you can use JavaScript to toggle between these style sheets, activate and deactivate them, and also combine them. The styleSheets property of the document object con- tains all style sheets on the page, in the order in which they are loaded or appear on a page. The most important property of every style sheet is disabled. If this is set to true, the style sheet becomes invisible and does not affect the layout of the page any longer. There are two approaches to access a specific style sheet:  n Using the ID of the style sheet as the index for  the styleSheets array.  n Using the number of the style sheet  starting at 0   as the index for the styleSheets array.  The former approach does not work well with Mozilla browsers, so you should use the numeric index, as the following code demonstrates:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function makeBold   {  document.styleSheets[0].disabled = false; document.styleSheets[1].disabled = true;   52  CHAPTER 4  CSS  window.setTimeout "makeLighter  ;", 1000 ;  function makeLighter   {  document.styleSheets[0].disabled = true; document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false; window.setTimeout "makeBold  ;", 1000 ;  }  }  window.onload = makeBold;      p { font-weight: bold; }       p { font-weight: lighter; }     CSS and JavaScript   Changing the Style Sheet  stylesheets.html   Accessing Individual CSS Rules  document.styleSheets[0].rules[0].style.color =  document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].style.color =   randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  The individual rules within a style sheet can be pro- grammatically accessed, as well. However, here, the web browsers differ from each other. Internet Explorer sup- ports the rules property, whereas all other browsers use the cssRules property.The one exception is the Opera browser, which supports neither of these two.   Accessing Individual CSS Rules  53  Note that you can access the rules and then, for instance, change them. Every rule behaves like a gener- ic HTML element:You use the style property to access all styles, and then modify or add styles. For the following example, a helper function generates a random color in RGB format:  function randomColor   {  var chars = "0123456789abcdef"; var color = ""; for  var i=0; i<6; i++  {  var rnd = Math.floor 16 * Math.random   ; color += chars.charAt rnd ;  } return color;  }  Then, the previous phrase is extended. First of all, every style sheet contains rules for both   and for   elements.Then, both of these rules get an addi- tional CSS command:The color is set to a random value.You may question how useful this simple exam- ple is in the real world, but the technology behind it can be adapted in a quite flexible way.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function makeBold   {  document.styleSheets[0].disabled = false; document.styleSheets[1].disabled = true; if  document.styleSheets[0].rules  {  document.styleSheets[0].rules[0].style.color =   document.styleSheets[0].rules[1].style.color =   randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  } else if  document.styleSheets[0].cssRules  {   54  CHAPTER 4  CSS  document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].style.color =   document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[1].style.color =   randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  } window.setTimeout "makeLighter  ;", 1000 ;  function makeLighter   {  document.styleSheets[0].disabled = true; document.styleSheets[1].disabled = false; if  document.styleSheets[0].rules  {  document.styleSheets[1].rules[0].style.color =   document.styleSheets[1].rules[1].style.color =   randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  randomColor  ;  } else if  document.styleSheets[0].cssRules  {  document.styleSheets[1].cssRules[0].style.color =   document.styleSheets[1].cssRules[1].style.color =   } window.setTimeout "makeBold  ;", 1000 ;  }  }  window.onload = makeBold;      p { font-weight: bold; } span { font-style: italic; }       p { font-weight: lighter; } span { font-style: normal; }     CSS  and  JavaScript   Accessing CSS Rules  rules.html    Letting the Contents of a Website Disappear  55  Figure 4.2 shows the result: Even though the book is in grayscale, you can see the different colors  or: shades of gray  of the paragraph and the   element inside it.  Figure 4.2 The text colors are applied at random  to the individual CSS rules.  Letting the Contents of a Website Disappear  document.getElementById show .style.display =   document.getElementById hide .style.display =   "block";  "none";  A quite common JavaScript effect on the web that uses CSS is to let elements of a page appear or disappear on request. Some pages implement a waiting screen on a slowly loading page; after the page has been loaded, the waiting screen disappears. Another example is to pro- vide a number of tabs—only one is shown at a time, and switching between them is done using JavaScript, without the need of time-consuming requests to the server.   56  CHAPTER 4  CSS  There are several ways to do this with JavaScript.You can use DOM, and you will find some phrases about letting DOM elements appear and disappear in Chapter 5,“DOM and DHTML.”Two alternatives are presented in the phrase. First, there is the visibility CSS command, which you can set to either visible or hidden to make the associated element appear or disappear.This translates to the JavaScript property visibility. Here is the code:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript"> function showHide show, hide  {  document.getElementById show .style.visibility =  document.getElementById hide .style.visibility =  "visible";  "hidden";  }     &nbsp; &nbsp;  <p id="tab1"  style="position: absolute; top: 5px; left: 5px;"> Tab 1    <p id="tab2" style="position: absolute; top: 5px;  left: 5px; visibility: hidden;">  Tab 2    <input type="button" value="Tab 1"  onclick="showHide 'tab1', 'tab2' ;"  >  <input type="button" value="Tab 2"  onclick="showHide 'tab2', 'tab1' ;"  >  Setting the Visibility of an Element  visibility.html    Letting the Contents of a Website Disappear  57  However, as you will see, the absolute positioning leads to some subtle differences across browsers.The best way is to use a block layout and set the display prop- erty of the element to either block or none:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript"> function showHide show, hide  {  document.getElementById show .style.display =   document.getElementById hide .style.display =   "block";  "none";  }       Tab 1       Tab 2    <input type="button" value="Tab 1"  onclick=”showHide 'tab1', 'tab2' ;"  >  <input type="button" value="Tab 2"  onclick="showHide 'tab2', 'tab1' ;"  >  Setting the Display Mode of an Element  display.html   Figure 4.3 shows the result: Clicking on the second button shows the second tab.   58  CHAPTER 4  CSS  Figure 4.3 Clicking on a button shows  the associated tab.  Applying JavaScript to CSS Selectors  Behaviour.register cssrules ;  In 1999, the W3C proposed “Behavioral Extensions to CSS  http:  w3.org TR 1999 WD-becss-19990804 , an approach to bind JavaScript code to CSS behaviors. The basic idea was to avoid use of the well-known onxxx HTML attributes. After 1999, not much progress was made in this area, but Ben Nolan managed to pro- vide a workaround  read: hack  to allow a similar con- cept. For it to work, you need the JavaScript library from http:  www.bennolan.com behaviour , in form of the file behaviour.js.  Note the British English spelling of the word—a perfect addition to the phrase- book!  This code collection allows providing rules containing JavaScript code in the form of CSS selectors. For it to work, you first need an external JavaScript file that defines CSS rules.You basically create an object with CSS selectors as the keys, and JavaScript event- handling functions as the values.Then, you call the   Applying JavaScript to CSS Selectors  59  Behaviour.register   method to report these rules to the behaviour library:  var cssrules = {  "p.para" : function e {  e.onmouseover = function  {  this.style.fontWeight = "bold";  } e.onmouseout = function  {  this.style.fontWeight = "normal";  }  }, "term" : function e {  e.onmouseover = function  {  this.style.fontStyle = "oblique";  }, e.onmouseout = function  {  this.style.fontStyle = "normal";  }  }  };  Behaviour.register cssrules ;  The CSS JavaScript Rules  rules.js   All that is left to do is to load both the JavaScript library and the preceding rules JavaScript file.Then the JavaScript code is executed when the associated events  in the example: mouseover and mouseout  are fired.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript" src="behaviour.js">    <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript" src="rules.js">   60  CHAPTER 4  CSS     CSS  and    JavaScript   Using the Behaviour JavaScript Library  behaviour.html   Figure 4.4 shows the result:When the mouse pointer is moved over the   element, two event handlers are called.  Figure 4.4 The JavaScript code gets executed.  NOTE: The main advantage of this approach lies in the fact that the JavaScript code completely resides in external files and is not cluttering the HTML markup of the page. From an architectural point of view, this is quite a bright idea—and it works cross-browser.  Changing the Mouse Cursor  document.getElementById "button" .style.cursor =   "help";  Every operating system comes with a certain set of mouse cursors, and CSS supports a subset of them.   Changing the Mouse Cursor  61  The appearance is a bit different between operating systems, but the general layout is quite similar. The CSS command in question is cursor, and it is also available from JavaScript, as the following code shows:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  document.getElementById "helpButton" .style.cursor   cid:1 = "help"; };   <input type="submit" id="helpButton" value="Get help"  >  Changing the Cursor  cursor.html   You can see the result in Figure 4.5:The mouse cursor now includes a question mark to make it more obvi- ous that there is help waiting behind the button.  Figure 4.5 The mouse cursor changes.  WARNING: Every mouse cursor fulfills its purpose. So you should really think twice before changing the appearance of the mouse cursor—do not irritate your users!   62  CHAPTER 4  CSS  CSS Cursor Styles  These are the allowed values for the cursor JavaScript CSS property:  n auto  n crosshair  n default  n e-resize  n help  n move  n n-resize  n ne-resize  n nw-resize  n pointer  n s-resize  n se-resize  n sw-resize  n test  n w-resize  n wait   5 DOM and DHTML  This chapter covers two loosely related JavaScript  techniques: DOM and DHTML.These two aspects of JavaScript have existed for several years, but only since the Netscape 4.x market share dropped under the Mozilla market share a few years ago has it been possi- ble to use them together. Originally, they did not have much in common, but now they are often used together.The focus of this chapter is on DOM, since many of the phrases throughout this book can more or less be categorized under “DHTML.”  Understanding DOM DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is quite self-describing: It provides an object model  and, alongside it, an API, or application programming inter- face  for a document. In the web context, this of course refers to an HTML document. One of the best ways to visualize the DOM for a web page is to use the DOM Inspector that comes with Mozilla browsers.Within the Document Object   64  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Model, all page elements are placed in a treelike hier- archy. Every HTML tag is a node within this tree, with subnodes and parent nodes. Also, every text portion is its own DOM node  a text node, to be exact . Figure 5.1 shows the DOM Inspector for a simple sample document.  Figure 5.1 The DOM Inspector shows all nodes  of a document.  Of course, the DOM API supports methods to not only access elements in the DOM tree, but also add and remove elements.Therefore, it is possible to modi- fy virtually anything on the page. One question remains:What is better, using the DOM or using some standard JavaScript objects like forms or images? Generally, the DOM way is much more flexi- ble, but sometimes more difficult as well.Therefore, if there is a JavaScript shortcut you can use, go with it. Otherwise, familiarize yourself with the DOM.   Accessing Specific Elements  65  NOTE: More DOM-related information can be found at the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C : http:  w3c.org DOM.  Understanding DHTML Although DOM is a “real” technical term, DHTML— or Dynamic HTML—is not. DHTML is a pure mar- keting term. Back when the term was coined, all it meant was something along the lines of “JavaScript for browsers version number 4 and up.” Back then, Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer were fight- ing the legendary browser war, and with their version 4, both vendors included more dynamic JavaScript fea- tures, unfortunately quite incompatible with each other. Most DHTML effects now and then cover posi- tioning elements and changing them upon user action. With Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 long gone, recent versions of both browser brands  remember that Netscape 6 followed Netscape 4 and is based on Mozilla’s Gecko Engine  support DOM reasonably well  although there are still some missing elements .There- fore, DHTML was reborn, since dynamic JavaScript effects are nowadays possible with only a small amount of browser-specific code and client sniffing.  Accessing Specific Elements  document.getElementById "para"   When you’re working with the DOM, the ideal way to later access an element on the page is by giving it a unique identifier, or ID.Then, the DOM method   66  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  document.getElementById   accesses the given element and enables you to go on from there: Modify the ele- ment, append subelements, or otherwise further navi- gate through the DOM tree. In the following example, the   element is accessed. Depending on the browser type, the string representa- tion of the element class is different.Whereas Internet Explorer just outputs [object], Mozilla browsers are more verbose and provide more information: [object HTMLParagraphElement].  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  window.alert document.getElementById "para"  ;  }    JavaScript Phrasebook   Accessing an Element By ID  getelementbyid.html   WARNING: The DOM is accessible only when the whole document has been loaded. That’s the reason the DOM access code is executed only after the load event has been fired.  Accessing Tags  document.getElementsByTagName “p”   An alternative way to access elements on the current page is to access them through the tag names.   Accessing Tags  67  Whenever you have to work on a set of elements that are represented by the same HTML tags  for instance, all list items or all paragraphs—everything that is not represented by another property of the JavaScript document object , the method document. getElementsByTagName   can be used.You provide the tag name and get an array of all elements, which you can then process further. The following code just accesses all   elements and counts them:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  window.alert   }    JavaScript Phrasebook   Sams Publishing   document.getElementsByTagName "p"  +  "  " + document.getElementsByTagName "p" .length + " elements " ;  Accessing Elements By Tag Name  getelementsbytagname.html   The output of the preceding code is [object HTMLCollection]  2 elements ; Internet Explorer once again gives less information, outputting [object]  2 elements .   68  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Navigating the DOM Tree  After you are inside the DOM, you can navigate in the DOM structure, going both up and down, to the left and to the right. Here is a list of the most important properties every DOM node has:  n firstChild: first child node n lastChild: last child node n childNodes: all child nodes  as an array  n parentNode: parent node n nextSibling: next node on the same level  “to  the right”    “to the left”   n previousSibling: previous node on the same level  Also, nodeName returns the name of the tag of the node  or text for text nodes , whereas nodeValue returns the value of a node  useful with text nodes .  Determining Node Information  s += nodeName + ": " + nodeValue +   "  " + nodeType + " \n";  As already mentioned in the previous phrase, it is possi- ble to gather information about a node, which is ex- tremely useful when working on arbitrary DOM data. Whereas nodeName gives information about the name of the node  tag name or text for text nodes , nodeValue is useful only for text nodes and returns the actual text in the node.The third category of information comes from the nodeType property, which gives information   Determining Node Information  69  regarding the kind of node.Table 5.1 contains a list of all possible values for nodeType.  Table 5.1 Node Types Node Type  1  2  3  8  9  10  11  Description Tag Attribute Text  includes whitespace  HTML comment Document DTD Fragment  The following code then analyzes a simple DOM structure and outputs information regarding all child nodes. Figure 5.2 shows the output in the browser.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  var s = ""; with  document.getElementById "para"   {  for  var i=0; i<childNodes.length; i++  {  with  childNodes[i]  {  s += nodeName + ": " + nodeValue +   "  " + nodeType + " \n";  }  }  } window.alert s ;  }     JavaScript  Phrasebook   Retrieving Node Information  nodeinfo.html    70  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Figure 5.2 Information about all child nodes.  Removing Elements  list.removeChild list.lastChild ;  The removeChild   method that every node has can be used to eliminate a node from the DOM tree. Note that you have to call this method from the parent ele- ment of the node to delete, and to provide the node as a parameter.The following sample shows a list and removes the last item every time the button is clicked; see Figure 5.3 for the output in the browser.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function removeItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; if  list.childNodes.length > 0  {  list.removeChild list.lastChild ;  }  }       Item    Adding Elements  71   Item   Item   Item     <input type="button" onclick="removeItem  ;"   value="Remove item"  >  Removing Nodes  remove.html   Figure 5.3 The last node gets removed.  TIP: When you only have direct access to the node to delete  curNode in the following code , this approach will work: curNode.parentNode.removeChild curNode ;  When you call this code in a handler function for the node itself, you can replace curNode with this.  Adding Elements  list.appendChild newNode ;  Creating new DOM nodes is done by the document. createElement   method. It creates a new element,   72  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  using the tag name provided as a parameter.This ele- ment can then be inserted into the DOM tree.The  node  method that is used most of the time is appendChild  . It appends a new child to the end of the children list. The following code adds a new, empty list element     to the end of the   list whenever the button is clicked:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var newNode = document.createElement "li" ; list.appendChild newNode ;  }     Item   <input type="button" onclick="addItem  ;"   value="Add item"  >  Adding Nodes  add.html   The disadvantage of this approach is that the new ele- ment is always appended to the end of the children list.To mitigate this effect, the insertBefore   method allows inserting a new node before any other node  so you can insert it anywhere but at the end of the list—you still have appendChild   for this . As in parameters, you provide the new node first, then the new sibling. The following code inserts a new   element to the beginning of the list anytime the button is clicked.This is documented in Figure 5.4.   Creating Text Elements  73  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var newNode = document.createElement "li" ; list.insertBefore newNode, list.firstChild ;  }     Item   <input type="button" onclick=vaddItem  ;"   value="Add item"  >  Adding Nodes at the Beginning of the Children List  addbefore.html   Figure 5.4 List elements are added to the  beginning of the list.  Creating Text Elements  var newTextNode =   document.createTextNode "Item " + nr ;  If you want to put text within an element, you need a text node that is a subnode of the actual element node. The createTextNode   method creates such a text node; you just provide the actual text.   74  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  In the following code, once again list elements are added; however, this time they do get text inside them. So first you create a text node, and then you append this text node to another node  which then could be appended to another node, which could be appended to yet another node, which…you get the picture .  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 1; function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var newNode = document.createElement "li" ; nr++; var newTextNode =   document.createTextNode "Item " + nr ;  newNode.appendChild newTextNode ; list.appendChild newNode ;  }     Item 1   <input type="button" onclick="addItem  ;"   value="Add item"  >  Creating  and Adding  a Text Node  textnode.html   Working with Attributes  newLink.setAttribute   "href", "http:  www.samspublishing.com " ;  So far, this chapter’s phrases have covered both regular tags and text nodes.The one major thing still missing   Working with Attributes  75  is attributes.You can access attributes in the form of nodes, but the most convenient way is to use the setAttribute   method: Just provide the attribute name and its value. In the following code, the contents of the new   items are a hyperlink, with an href attribute set:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 1; function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var newNode = document.createElement "li" ; var newLink = document.createElement "a" ; newLink.setAttribute "href",  "http:  www.samspublishing.com " ;  nr++; var newTextNode =   document.createTextNode "Item " + nr ;  newLink.appendChild newTextNode ; newNode.appendChild newLink ; list.appendChild newNode ;  }     Item 1   <input type="button" onclick="addItem  ;"   value="Add item"  >  Setting Attributes  attributes.html   Figure 5.5 shows that all links added to the list do point to the provided URL.   76  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Figure 5.5 Dynamically generated hyperlinks.  Cloning Elements  var newItem = oldItem.cloneNode true ;  Instead of creating new nodes all over again, you can also clone an existing node.The cloneNode   method that every node has does this for you.You can decide whether to clone only the node and its attribute, or to clone all child nodes  and their child nodes and so on  as well. If you provide true as the parameter for cloneNode  , a so-called “deep copy” also copies chil- dren; false copies only the node itself.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 1; function addItem cloneMode  {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var oldItem = list.firstChild; var newItem = oldItem.cloneNode cloneMode ; list.appendChild newItem ;  }     Replacing Elements  77    <a href="http:  www. samspublishing.com ">Item 1    <input type="button" onclick="addItem true ;"   value="Clone all"  >  <input type="button" onclick="addItem false ;"   value="Clone node only"  >  Cloning Nodes  clone.html   When you click on the first button, the whole node  including subelements like the link and list item text  are copied; the second button clones only the node itself, generating a new but empty list item.Take a look at Figure 5.6 to see the difference.  Figure 5.6 Two ways to copy nodes.  Replacing Elements  list.replaceChild newNode, list.firstChild ;  If you remove a node and then insert another one at the same place, the replaceChild   method saves you a bit of coding.You provide the new and the old node, and JavaScript does the rest for you. Remember that   78  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  you have to call this method from the parent element of the old and the new node!  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 1; function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; var newNode = document.createElement "li" ; nr++; var newTextNode =   document.createTextNode "Item " + nr ;  newNode.appendChild newTextNode ; list.replaceChild newNode, list.firstChild ;  }     Item 1   <input type="button" onclick="addItem  ;"   value="Replace item"  >  Replacing Nodes  replace.html   The preceding code replaces the first child  node  of the list with a new node.  Creating a Bulleted List from JavaScript Data  var newItem = document.createElement "li" ; var newText = document.createTextNode data[i] ; newItem.appendChild newText ; list.appendChild newItem ;  Especially in the context with Web Services and AJAX  see Chapters 10 and 11 , you often receive data from   Creating a Bulleted List from JavaScript Data  79  the server and have to display it in a dynamic way. One good approach is to use an HTML list.The fol- lowing code provides a function createList   that expects an array with values and converts this into a list.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function createList data  {  var list = document.createElement "ul" ; for  var i = 0; i < data.length; i++  {  var newItem = document.createElement "li" ; var newText = document.createTextNode data[i] ; newItem.appendChild newText ; list.appendChild newItem ;  } return list;  }  window.onload = function   {  var list = createList   ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"] ;  document.body.appendChild list ;  }    Creating a List  list.html   Note that document.body is a shortcut to the   element  otherwise, you could use document. getElementxByTagName "body" [0] ; then appendChild   adds the HTML list to the end of the page.   80  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Creating a Table from JavaScript Data  var td = document.createElement "td" ; var newText = document.createTextNode data[i][j] ; td.appendChild newText ; tr.appendChild td ;  A bit more complicated than a list is a whole table. First, you have to use the   element  and may want to use   and or  , as well . Otherwise, you may not see anything in Internet Explorer. The helper function createTable   expects a multi- dimensional array. Every array element itself is a list of values to be displayed in the table; the first array element contains the header text for each column. As you can see, the code gets longer, but on the other hand the basic approach is the same: Create nodes and text nodes and then append them to each other in the correct order. Figure 5.7 shows the resulting table.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function createTable data  {  var table = document.createElement "table" ; var thead = document.createElement "thead" ; var tr = document.createElement "tr" ; for  var i = 0; i < data[0].length; i++  {  var th = document.createElement "th" ; var newText =   document.createTextNode data[0][i] ;  th.appendChild newText ;   Creating a Table from JavaScript Data  81  tr.appendChild th ;  } thead.appendChild tr ; table.appendChild thead ;  var tbody = document.createElement "tbody" ; for  var i = 1; i < data.length; i++  {  var tr = document.createElement "tr" ; for  var j=0; j < data[i].length; j++  { var td = document.createElement "td" ; var newText =   document.createTextNode data[i][j] ;  td.appendChild newText ; tr.appendChild td ;  } tbody.appendChild tr ;  }  }  table.appendChild tbody ; return table;  window.onload = function   {  var table = createTable [  ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"], ["un", "deux", "trois", "quatre", "cinq"], ["eins", "zwei", "drei", "vier", "fünf"]] ;  document.body.appendChild table ;  }    Creating a Table  table.html    82  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  Figure 5.7 The dynamically generated table.  Changing HTML Fragments  list.innerHTML += newNode;  Changing text nodes  either by replacing them or by using the nodeValue property  changes only actual text, but you cannot change complete HTML fragments, including subelements.To do that, the innerHTML prop- erty of every element may prove useful. Although innerHTML is not standardized and is not part of any DOM specification, it works just fine.With innerHTML, you can change the inner HTML of any HTML element and even provide new subelements, as the following listing shows:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 1; function addItem   {  var list = document.getElementById "list" ; nr++; var newNode = " Item " + nr + " "; list.innerHTML += newNode;  }   Positioning Elements  83      Item 1   <input type="button" onclick="addItem  ;"   value="Add item"  >  Adding Elements via innerHTML  innerhtml.html   So instead of using the clean and inconvenient DOM approach, innerHTML just writes the HTML into one element. Both approaches have their individual advantages and disadvantages: innerHTML requires that you take care of character encoding by yourself, but on the other hand it allows you to add or change several elements at once.  Positioning Elements  el.style.left = "0px"; el.style.posLeft = 0; el.style.top = "0px"; el.style.posTop = 0;  CSS supports two ways to position an element: absolute positioning and relative positioning. No mat- ter which method you choose, with JavaScript you can set the positioning values. Usually, the absolute posi- tioning is more convenient since you do not have to calculate relative positions of nested elements then. In most browsers, the left property defines the x coordinate of the element, and the top property is used for the y coordinate.The values are not numeric but— as usual in CSS—include a unit, usually px for pixels. For Internet Explorer, you need a different approach. The posLeft and posTop properties set the horizontal   84  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  and vertical position; however, this time, you just pro- vide a numeric value, no unit. The most convenient approach is to just set all of these properties, since there are no side effects.This saves you from client sniffing. The following code positions the   element in the upper-left corner.

The following code animates an ad banner diagonally over the page.The only potential issue is how to ani- mate the position. For the Internet Explorer properties  posLeft, posTop , just adding a value suffices. For left and top, you first have to determine the old position and then add a value to it.The JavaScript function parseInt   extracts the numeric content from a string like "123px". However, parseInt   returns NaN if no value is found in left or top.Therefore, the following helper function takes care of this situation; in this case, 0 is returned instead:  function myParseInt s  { var ret = parseInt s ; return  isNaN ret  ? 0 : ret ;  }  Then, the following code animates the banner and stops after 50 iterations:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var nr = 0; var id = null; function animate   {  nr++; if  nr > 50  {  window.clearInterval id ;   86  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  document.getElementById "element" .style   cid:1 .visibility = "hidden";  } else {  var el = document.getElementById "element" ; el.style.left =    myParseInt el.style.left  + 5  + "px";  el.style.posLeft += 5; el.style.top =    myParseInt el.style.top  + 5  + "px";  el.style.posTop += 5;  }  } window.onload = function   {  id = window.setInterval "animate  ;", 100 ;  };    My Portal  <div id="element" style="position: absolute; background-color: eee; border: 1px solid"> JavaScript Phrasebook    Animating an Element  animate.html; excerpt   Creating a Sticky Navigation  window.onload = positionNavigation; window.onscroll = positionNavigation;  Sometimes it is important that one part of a page is always visible.

So the pre- ceding code is used to call the positioning code both when the page loads and when it scrolls. For calculating the new position, you have to calculate the current scroll offset. Internet Explorer provides document.body.scrollLeft and document.body.scrollTop for that; the other browsers use window.pageXOffset and window.pageYOffset.The following code maintains the position of the navigation, and Figure 5.8 shows the result.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function positionNavigation   {  var nav = document.getElementById "navigation" ; var x, y; var navwidth = 155; if  window.innerWidth  {  x = window.innerWidth + window.pageXOffset –   navwidth;  y = window.pageYOffset + 10;  } else {  with  document.body  {  x = clientWidth + scrollLeft - navwidth; y = scrollTop + 10;  }  } nav.style.left = x + "px"; nav.style.posLeft = x; nav.style.top = y + "px"; nav.style.posTop = y;  } window.onload = positionNavigation; window.onscroll = positionNavigation;    My Portal    88  CHAPTER 5 DOM and DHTML  <div id="navigation" style="position: absolute; background-color: eee; border: 1px solid">  Sams Publishing   <a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product  0672328801">This book at Amazon    Author’s weblog     Maintaining the Position of an Element  sticky.html; excerpt   Figure 5.8 A sticky navigation with JavaScript.  Creating a Flash Pop-Up Ad     With pop-up blockers becoming more and more com- mon in web browsers, creators of web advertisements have to become more creative.

The file flashad.swf is a simple Flash animation that includes a button that makes the ad disappear when the user clicks on it.The following ActionScript code  a language also based on ECMAScript  does this by calling JavaScript code in the browser:  on  release  {  getURL "javascript:void document.getElementById    cid:1 ’banner’ .style.visibility=’hidden’ ;" ; }  The code of the page itself is quite similar to the code from the previous phrase: Just as in a sticky navigation, the Flash ad should always be visible.

This page intentionally left blank    6 OOP and Events  The more advanced JavaScript applications get, the  greater is the need for structuring the code well. One way to do so is by using OOP, object-oriented pro- gramming. JavaScript itself is not an object-oriented language, but rather an object-based language. So there is a support for OOP, though it’s somewhat limited. The second topic of this chapter is the general JavaScript event handling. Apart from the basics, special events  mouse and keyboard  are covered.  Creating a Class  function UniversalClass   { }  There is no distinctive keyword for classes in JavaScript. Instead, each class is defined as a function. The difference between a regular function and this one is the way this function is later called: with the new keyword.The following listing implements a simple class; upon instantiation, the window.alert   box pops up.   94  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function UniversalClass   {  window.alert "Welcome to my class!" ;  }  var uc = new UniversalClass  ;    A Simple Class  class.html   Accessing Class Members  this.Count = count;  When you’re working with class members, the most important aspect is to explicitly define all members.To allow external code to access the class members  prop- erties and methods , the this keyword must be used. So if you define a function XYZ   within the class, it is available as a class method only if you add this code:  this.XYZ = XYZ;  Within this method, you can also access class proper- ties using this; however, they have to be defined as well. For accessing class members both internally and externally, the dot  .  is used to separate instance name and member name. The following code implements a simple class.The only class method, Count    internal name: count   , takes one parameter and then counts in the given language. Figure 6.1 shows the result.   Accessing Class Members  95  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function UniversalCounter   {  this.copyright = " C  2006 JavaScript Phrasebook"; this.Count = count; var numbers = {  "en": "one, two, three", "fr": "un, deux, trois", "de": "eins, zwei, drei"  }; function count language  { if  numbers[language]  {  window.alert numbers[language] ;  } else {  window.alert "Unknown language" ;  }  }  }  var uc = new UniversalCounter  ; uc.Count "fr" ;    A Class with Members  members.html   Figure 6.1 The “Universal Counter.”   96  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  NOTE: Another way to create objects is to use the Object constructor, in the following fashion: var uc = new Object  ; uc.copyright = " C  2006 JavaScript Phrasebook "; uc.printCopyright = function   {   window.alert this.copyright ;  };  Emulating Private Class Members  JavaScript does not have class modifiers like public, protected, and private that define who may access class members and who may not. However, as you can see in the previous phrase, there is quite an easy way to emulate private class members: If you do not “register” a variable or function within the class using the this keyword, it is visible only internally. In the previous phrase, the numbers object cannot be accessed from the outside, but is used internally by the Count   count   method.  Inheriting Classes  UniversalCounter.prototype =   new UniversalTranslator  ;  JavaScript does not enjoy an inheritance system for classes. However, via use of the prototype keyword, something similar can be—once again—emulated. With prototype, you can provide class members that are valid for all objects, including inherited ones.When JavaScript has to look up a property or method  for   Inheriting Classes  97  example, when object.methodname   will be executed , JavaScript first looks into the class and then looks into the prototype object.This allows some kind of inheritance. In the following example, the UniversalTranslator class defines a member  copyright .Then, the UniversalCounter   class is implemented in a similar fashion as before.The following command sets the prototype property of the UniversalCounter class to a new instance of the UniversalTranslator class. Consequence:The UniversalCounter class inherits all properties of the UniversalTranslator class and can access it:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function UniversalTranslator   {  this.copyright = " C  2006 JavaScript Phrasebook";  }  function UniversalCounter   {  this.Count = count;  var numbers = {  "en": "one, two, three", "fr": "un, deux, trois", "de": "eins, zwei, drei"  }; function count language  { if  numbers[language]  {  window.alert numbers[language] +   " [" + this.copyright + "]" ;  window.alert "Unknown language" ;  } else {  }  }   98  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  } UniversalCounter.prototype =   new UniversalTranslator  ;  var uc = new UniversalCounter  ; uc.Count "de" ;    Class Inheritance with Prototype  inheritance.html   Figure 6.2 shows that this really works:The copyright property can be accessed from the UniversalCounter class although it is defined in the UniversalTranslator class.  Figure 6.2 The inherited class property is shown.  WARNING: Only class members are inherited, but not class constructor code. If you want to do this as well, you have to define a specific method to be the class constructor, and call it manually in the derived class.   Extending Built-In JavaScript Objects  99  Extending Built-In JavaScript Objects  Date.prototype.isLeapYear = isLeapYear;  The prototype property can also be used to extend built-in JavaScript classes. In the following code, a function, isLeapYear  , is implemented that determines whether the return value of getFullYear   is a leap year. Note that the getFullYear   method is not implemented; using the prototype property, however, isLeapYear   becomes a method of the Date object and thus also has access to Date.getFullYear  .  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function isLeapYear   {  var y = this.getFullYear  ; return  y % 4 == 0 &&    y % 100 != 0  y % 400 == 0  ;  } Date.prototype.isLeapYear = isLeapYear;  var d = new Date  ; window.alert d.isLeapYear   ;    Extending the Date Class  extend.html    100  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  JavaScript OOP Enhancements in Microsoft Atlas  The Microsoft AJAX Framework Atlas  http:  atlas. asp.net   also implements several new OOP extensions to JavaScript, making some standard OOP techniques simpler to implement. Among these features are the following:  n Namespaces n Inheritance and access to base methods n Abstract classes and methods n Interfaces  Especially with the new AJAX hype, more and more libraries emerge that also spice up JavaScript’s OOP support. Another option that demonstrates JavaScript OOP well is prototype.js  http:  prototype.conio.net  .  Reacting Upon JavaScript Events  button.addEventListener "click", eventHandler,   false ;  button.attachEvent "onclick", eventHandler ;  Reacting on JavaScript events can be done in different ways:  n Using an HTML attribute:     n Using the onXXX JavaScript attribute:  window.onload = xyz;   Reacting Upon JavaScript Events  101  However, there are various, competing event mecha- nisms in the different browsers. Internet Explorer sup- ports attaching events to an element using the attachEvent   method.The name of the event here equals the HTML attribute, so you use "onload", for instance  though the event itself is called "load" . All other relevant browsers support the addEventListener   method, a part of the W3C model. Here, you provide the name of the event, so just "load" instead of "onload". The following example shows how to attach an event to a button in a cross-browser fashion:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript"> function eventHandler   {  window.alert "Event fired!" ;  }  window.onload = function   {  var button =   document.getElementById "eventButton" ;  if  button.addEventListener  {  button.addEventListener "click", eventHandler,   } else if  button.attachEvent  {  button.attachEvent “onclick", eventHandler ;  false ;  }  };   <input type="button" id="eventButton"   value="Click me!"  >  Attaching an Event  attach.html    102  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  NOTE: You can remove event handlers, as well. Internet Explorer uses detachEvent  , whereas other browsers follow the W3C and name their function removeEventListener  .  Understanding Event Bubbling  When it comes to event handling, today’s browsers support one of two concepts. Internet Explorer works with the so-called “event bubbling”: An event is first fired from the very element where it occurs, and then bubbles up the DOM structure.Therefore, it is possible to capture and react upon this event at various places. For instance, imagine the following markup:     JavaScript  Phrasebook    If the mouse hovers over the text JavaScript, the mouseover event is first fired in the   element and then bubbles up to the   and   elements. The competing model is the W3C model, which is supported by Mozilla browsers, Opera, and Safari Konqueror. Here, the events are first sinking downward to the target element, and then bubbling up. So in the previous example, the event “visits” the  ,  , and   elements and then bubbles up again via the   and   elements.When adding an event listener, you can specify in the third parameter of addEventListener   whether the event will be inter- cepted during sinking down  true  or bubbling up  false . After an event has been intercepted, it is also possible to stop it from sinking down or bubbling up.   Using Keyboard Events  103  In Internet Explorer, set the event’s cancelBubble prop- erty to false:  window.event.cancelBubble = false;  The W3C model supports the stopPropagation   method:  e.stopPropagation  ;  As you can see, in Internet Explorer the current event is always available via window.event, whereas other browsers automatically receive the event as the param- eter  here called e  for the event listener.  Using Keyboard Events  document.onkeydown = showKey;  Keyboard events are not part of DOM Level 1 or Level 2, but are still implemented in recent browsers. Accessing the events differs from the usual approach  window.event in Internet Explorer; the event as the automatic parameter of the function in all other browsers . But then, the keyCode property returns the ASCII code of the key, which can then be processed, as in the following code:  done. Christian<script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function showKey e  {  var key; if  window.event  {  key = window.event.keyCode;  } else {  key = e.keyCode;    104  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  } key = String.fromCharCode key ; document.getElementById "para" .innerHTML += key;  }  window.onload = function   {  document.onkeydown = showKey;  }    Click and type here:    Listening to Keyboard Events  key.html   Figure 6.3 shows the result.The keys that are pressed are shown.  Figure 6.3 The key pressed is shown.  NOTE: All characters in Figure 6.3 are shown in uppercase, since JavaScript always takes into consideration which key was pressed, not whether it was upper- or lowercase. You can, however, also find out whether special keys were pressed by taking a look at the altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey properties.   Submitting a Form with the Enter Key  105  Submitting a Form with the Enter Key  if  key == 13  {  document.forms[0].submit  ;  }  Depending on the browser type and configuration, pressing the Enter key while in a form field does not always submit the form. Sometimes, for instance, the button that submits the form resides in another frame. In that case, adding a bit of JavaScript to ensure that the Enter key sends the form data, as well, comes in handy. All that is necessary to implement for that function- ality is the standard key event listener from the previ- ous phrase.The key code for the Enter key is 13, so when this code is found, the form is submitted:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function checkKey e  {  key = window.event.keyCode;  var key; if  window.event  {  } else {  key = e.keyCode;   } if  key == 13  {  document.forms[0].submit  ;  }  } window.onload = function   {  document.forms[0].elements["field"].onkeydown =  checkKey;   106  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  }          Submitting a Form When Enter Has Been Pressed  formsubmit.html   Using Mouse Events  document.onmousemove = showPosition;  When the mouse is being used, there is one quite interesting event to listen to  apart from click, of course : mousemove.The mouse position can be deter- mined by looking at certain properties. Again, these properties depend on which of the two browser groups the client belongs to: Internet Explorer or the rest of the world:  n clientX and clientY for Internet Explorer n pageX and pageY for all other browsers  Here is a complete listing that shows the current mouse position in the status bar of the browser  if available :  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function showPosition e  {  var x, y; if  window.event  {   Using Mouse Events  107  x = window.event.clientX; y = window.event.clientY;  } else {  x = e.pageX;  y = e.pageY;   } window.status = "x: " + x + ", y: " + y;  } window.onload = function   {  document.onmousemove = showPosition;  }    Tracking Mouse Movements  mouse.html   WARNING: Some browsers do not allow JavaScript to update the status bar, for instance, recent Firefox versions. You do not get an error message, but the status bar remains unchanged. Figure 6.4 shows the result in a browser that does support changing the text in the status bar.  Figure 6.4 The mouse position is  continuously updated.   108  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  Distinguishing Mouse Buttons  When it comes to finding out which mouse button has been pressed  when you listen to the click event , the browsers once again have different solutions. Both solutions use the button property of the event prop- erty, but the values are different. Mozilla follows the W3C standard: 0 means left button, 1 means middle button, 2 means right button. How- ever, the rest of the world, which includes Microsoft and other browsers, supports a more logical way: 1 means left button, 2 means right button, and 4 means middle button. As you can see from these numbers, these are all powers of 2.Therefore, you can combine these values. For instance, a value of 3 means that both the left and the right button have been pressed at the same time.   7 Cookies  JavaScript is a purely client-side technology. Admit-  tedly, it is possible to use JavaScript on the server, but this has nothing to do with JavaScript running in the browser; it is a similar syntax in a completely different context. Usually, JavaScript is completely restricted to the cur- rent page and does not have access to something from the server.There are very few exceptions to this rule. One exception can be found in Chapter 11,“AJAX  and Related Topics ,” and another one is covered in this chapter. Cookies are not a specific browser technology, but a mechanism in the client server model to overcome one major shortcoming in the HTTP protocol. HTTP is stateless, which means that the protocol does not have a memory. A client opens a connection to a server, retrieves a document  or an image or any other data , and then closes the connection.The next time data is sent to this specific client from the server, the server does not recognize the client.   110  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  Cookies can help work around this situation. A server can send a short bit of text information to the client, the so-called cookie. If—and only if—this data is accepted and locally saved, the client sends this data back with every request to the same server.This enables the server application to recognize the user again. The good thing: JavaScript can both get  read  and set  write  cookies, avoiding the HTTP protocol.This allows some scenarios that are not possible with HTTP and a server-side technology alone. Other mechanisms to achieve a similar result are ses- sions, but this is something that must be implemented by the server-side technology, unrelated to JavaScript.  Understanding Cookies When a web server sends a cookie to a client, an HTTP header entry in the following fashion is used:  Set-Cookie: session=abcd1234; expires=Tue,   cid:1 20-Feb-2007 12:10:52 GMT; path= ;   cid:1 domain=.samspublishing.com  Then the client receives this cookie information and, according to the client capabilities and or its configu- ration, takes one of the following four actions:  n The client ignores the cookie. n The client accepts the cookie. n The client asks the user whether to accept  the cookie.  n The client rejects the cookie.   Understanding Cookies  111  Actually, the first and the last actions are the same. It is not possible for the web server to find out whether a cookie has been refused by the user, refused by the client configuration, or ignored by the client due to a lack of cookie support. If accepted, cookies are then sent back to the server if a combination of requirements is met.The associated HTTP header entry then looks like this:  Cookie: session=abcd1234  A cookie can be tied to a domain and a path. Therefore, a cookie is usually sent back only to the server it originated from. It is possible to overwrite the domain value in a cookie, but some browsers then automatically refuse this cookie. Also, there are some limitations for cookies. Not all browsers support them in a similar fashion, but the fol- lowing requirements are the minimum set a browser must support:  n 4KB  4096 bytes  per cookie n 20 cookies per domain n 300 cookies total  NOTE: There is no official cookie specification that is sup- ported across browsers, but all relevant clients support a proprietary “preliminary” specification Netscape published in the 1990s. It is still available for viewing at http:  wp. netscape.com newsref std cookie_spec.html.   112  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  Setting Cookies  document.cookie = "myLanguage=JavaScript";  Setting a cookie with JavaScript equals setting the cookie property of the document object. It is important to use the same format the HTTP protocol uses for sending a cookie to the client. For “regular cookies”  cookies without expiration dates or other restrictions, as detailed in the following phrases , the name and the value of the cookie have to be separated by an equal sign.The name of the cookie must not contain any special characters like spaces, semicolons, and whitespace; such special characters in the cookie value should be URL-encoded  for instance, a space charac- ter turns into %20, the hexadecimal representation of its ASCII value .The specification recommends the encoding, but does not prescribe it. As the following listing shows, setting more than one cookie can be achieved by setting multiple values to document.cookie.Therefore, writing to document.cookie does not overwrite any previous cookies, but is just adding cookies.The only exception to this rule: If a cookie of the same name exists, the client tries to overwrite it.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  document.cookie = "myLanguage=JavaScript"; document.cookie =   "myOtherLanguage=PHP:%20Hypertext%20Preprocessor"     Setting a Cookie with JavaScript  setcookie.html    Reading Out Cookies  113  Figure 7.1 shows the result in the browser if it’s con- figured to ask the user before setting a cookie.  Figure 7.1 The browser tries to set the cookie  sent from JavaScript.  Reading Out Cookies  var cookies = document.cookie.split  ;  g ;  When accessing document.cookie, JavaScript retrieves a list of all cookies the browser would send to the cur- rent server. Unfortunately, this access is not available in the form of an array, but of a string. For instance, the previous phrase would generate the following value for document.cookie:  myLanguage=JavaScript;  cid:1 myOtherLanguage=PHP:%20Hypertext%20Preprocessor  Therefore, to get cookies out of this value, the follow- ing steps must be taken: 1. Split the cookie string at “; “  to get individual  cookies .   114  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  2. Identify the first equal sign  =  in every cookie as  the name value delimiter.  Since the cookie values may contain equal signs as well, the first occurrence of an equal sign must be used.The following code prints out all cookies in the form of an HTML table. Before it’s written to the page, HTML special characters are properly escaped with an HtmlEscape   function.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  document.write "   Name    cid:1  Value  " ;  var cookies = document.cookie.split  ;  g ; for  var i=0; i<cookies.length; i++  {  var cookie = cookies[i]; if  cookie.indexOf "="  == -1  {  continue;  } var name =   var value =   cookie.substring 0, cookie.indexOf "="  ;  cookie.substring cookie.indexOf "="  + 1 ;  document.write "  " +   HtmlEscape name  +  "  " +  HtmlEscape unescape value   + "  " ;  } document.write " " ;    Reading Out Cookies  getcookies.html; excerpt   Figure 7.2 shows the possible output of the preceding listing.   Reading Out Cookies  115  Figure 7.2 All cookies in the system are printed  in the browser.  When the value of one specific cookie is required, a helper function may come in handy. It looks for the given cookie name and returns the value  which is everything to the right of the cookie name, until the next semicolon or the end of the string :  function getCookie name  {  var pos = document.cookie.indexOf name + "=" ; if  pos == -1  {  return null;  } else {  var pos2 = document.cookie.indexOf ";", pos ; if  pos2 == -1  {  return unescape   document.cookie.substring  pos + name.length + 1  ;  } else {  return unescape   document.cookie.substring   pos + name.length + 1, pos2  ;  }  }  }  Reading Out a Single Cookie  getsinglecookie.html    116  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  TIP: Never forget to unescape the cookie value data. In the given example, this was done by using unescape   because the original cookies were escaped using escape  . If you are using another escaping scheme, you have to use the proper unescaping mechanism in your code.  Setting an Expiration Date  document.cookie="myLanguage=JavaScript; expires=  cid:1 Tue, 25-Dec-2007 12:34:56 GMT"  By default, cookies expire when the user closes the browser.These cookies are then called temporary cookies.The opposite are persistent cookies, meaning cookies that live longer than the browser session. So when the browser is restarted, the cookie is still there. For this to work, the cookie needs an expiration date detailing how long the cookie may remain in the browser.The cookie specification demands that the expiration date is provided in GMT  Greenwich mean time , and that the following format is used:  Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT  Here is a possible value:  Tue, 25-Dec-2007 12:34:56 GMT  This makes determining the correct date information  especially the weekday  quite hard; eventually, external libraries that can help with this task come in handy. When the date is determined, it just has to be used in the value for document.cookie, as the code at the beginning of this phrase has demonstrated  see expirecookie.html .   Using Other Cookie Options  117  Figure 7.3 shows the output of this code on a system that uses the GMT+1 time zone and therefore is one hour ahead of GMT. Of course, this information is dis- played only when the browser is configured to ask the user when a cookie arrives.  Figure 7.3 This cookie comes with an expiration date.  Using Other Cookie Options  document.cookie="myLanguage=JavaScript; expires=  cid:1 Tue, 25-Dec-2007 12:34:56 GMT; path= ;   cid:1 domain=.example.com; secure"  Although the expiration date of a cookie is by far the most commonly used feature, there are others as well: n path—This sets the path to tie the cookie to.The default value is the current path. If this is set to  , the whole website receives the cookie.  n domain—This specifies which domain s  to use. By  specification, at least two dots are required in the domain name, but many browsers ignore that.   118  CHAPTER 6 OOP and Events  If this is set to .example.com, then www.example.com and subdomain.example.com receive the cookie. n secure—If this is set  just by putting it in the  cookie string , the cookie is transmitted only via a secured connection  HTTPS .

This option has been introduced to avoid some secu- rity issues on some websites allowing the theft of sensible cookie data with JavaScript.

Checking for Cookie Support  119  Deleting Cookies  document.cookie="myLanguage=JavaScript; expires=  cid:1 Thu, 25-Dec-1980 12:34:56 GMT"  Setting a cookie value to an empty string effectively destroys the cookie data, but does not eliminate the cookie itself.To get rid of a cookie, the expiration date must be set to some point in the past. Since the UNIX time measuring starts on January 1, 1970, a date some- where close to this point is recommended.The pre- ceding code  see deletecookie.html  uses Christmas 1980 as the cookie expiration date.The web browser sees that this date lies in the past  unless the user changed the local time settings  and deletes the cookie. Once again, it is important that the same cookie fea- tures are used as when the cookie was set.  Checking for Cookie Support  document.cookie="CookieTestTemp=success" document.cookie="CookieTestPers=success; expires=  cid:1 Tue, 25-Dec-2012 12:34:56 GMT"  The only way to actually find out whether a cookie has been successfully set is by checking for the cookie upon the next request to the server. However, with JavaScript, this can be done instantly within one page. The following code first sets two cookies  a temporary one and a persistent one  and then checks whether these two actions were successful. Also, the test cookies are deleted again—but of course only if setting them has been successful.   120  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  document.cookie="CookieTestTemp=success" document.cookie="CookieTestPers=success; expires=  cid:1 Tue, 25-Dec-2012 12:34:56 GMT" if  document.cookie.indexOf   "CookieTestTemp=success"  != -1  { window.alert "Temporary cookies are supported!"  document.cookie="CookieTestTemp=JavaScript;   cid:1 expires=Thu, 25-Dec-1980 12:34:56 GMT" } else {  window.alert   "Temporary cookies are not supported!”   } if  document.cookie.indexOf   "CookieTestPers=success"  != -1  { window.alert "Persistent cookies are supported!"  document.cookie="CookieTestPers=JavaScript;   cid:1 expires=Thu, 25-Dec-1980 12:34:56 GMT" } else {  window.alert   "Persistent cookies are not supported!"   }    Checking the Browser’s Cookie Support  checkcookie.html   Saving Multiple Information in One Cookie  for  var el in data  {  namevalue += "&" + escape el  +   "=" + escape data[el] ;  }   Saving Multiple Information in One Cookie  121  Remember the limitations for a cookie-driven site: Only 20 cookies per domain are allowed. Also, if users get a warning when a cookie arrives, the more cookies you send the more annoyed your users will be.There- fore, it can be a clever idea to store more than one bit of information in a cookie. For this to work, the cookie data must be serialized. There are several different approaches to this, including some really advanced ones. However, if you just want to store a list of name value pairs, URL encoding is the easiest thing to implement:  function serialize data  {  var namevalue = ""; for  var el in data  {  namevalue += "&" + escape el  +   "=" + escape data[el] ;  } return namevalue.substring 1 ;  }  Serializing an Object  serialize.html; excerpt   When complex data is used in a cookie, code in the following fashion may be used:  document.cookie = "data=" + serialize myComplexData   The way back requires a bit more code, but consists largely of splitting the data into individual pairs and extracting names and values out of the result:  function unserialize data  {  var object = new Array  ; var pairs = data.split  & g ; for  var i=0; i<pairs.length; i++  {   122  CHAPTER 7  Cookies  if  pairs[i].indexOf "="  > -1  {  object[unescape pairs[i].substring   0, pairs[i].indexOf "="   ] =  unescape pairs[i].substring  pairs[i].indexOf "="  + 1  ;  }  } return object;  }  Unserializing an Object  serialize.html; excerpt   The code file serialize.html serializes and unserializes an object, without using cookies to make the code a bit shorter.  NOTE: At http:  www.iconico.com workshop jsSerializer , a more complex serializer is shown that converts an object into XML. Also, the discussion on JSON from Chapter 11, “AJAX  and Related Topics ,” may be of interest here.   8 Forms  When you’re working with server-side technologies,  forms are the one aspect of HTML that is most useful since it enables users to “communicate” with the server—by entering data into a form and then submit- ting that form to the server. From a JavaScript point of view, HTML forms are very interesting as well.The options HTML is offering are somehow limited, and JavaScript can come to the rescue here. User data must be validated, forms may accept only certain kinds of input, form submission can be possible only when certain requirements are met. All this—and more—is possible with JavaScript, as covered in this chapter.  Understanding HTML Forms with JavaScript  document.forms[0]  Usually, you access an HTML element using its ID and then document.getElementById  . However, with HTML forms, document.forms is generally used.   124  CHAPTER 8  Forms  One reason for this is that the name attribute of each form element is used when the form is submitted to the server. document.forms is an array of all forms on the current page. So if the form contains only one form, document. forms[0] accesses it. Alternatively, forms can also get a name:    ...    Then, document.forms["mainForm"] accesses the form. All elements within the form are also referenced by their name, serving as array index for the elements property of the form. For instance, imagine that the first form on a page has an element with the attribute name="element1".Then, the following JavaScript code accesses this element:  document.forms[0].elements["element1"]  There are also shorter versions to access form informa- tion. A form named "mainForm" and an element "element1" allows this shortcut:  document.mainForm.element1  Generally, the more detailed approach using the forms array and especially the elements array is used, since this can also be used with automated access to the form elements. JavaScript can modify form elements, act upon certain events being triggered, and also submit the form  and prevent it from being submitted . Also, JavaScript can come in handy with regard to form data validation. Do, however, always keep in mind that JavaScript can   Accessing Text Fields  125  be deactivated.The form must also work without JavaScript.  TIP: Every form element supports the form property, which points to the form the element resides in. Therefore, this.form is used quite often in the code for form field elements to grant easy access to the element’s form, with- out having to go through the document.forms array.  Accessing Text Fields  window.alert f.elements["textfield"].value ;  HTML supports three types of text fields:  n Single-line text fields:   n Multiline text fields:    n Password fields:    Although: these fields behave quite differently in a web browser, access from JavaScript is quite similar.The value attribute of each of these fields contains the text within the field.This can be used both for reading and for writing the field’s text. The following code shows two things: first, how to access the field’s property, and second, how to use this.form to give easy access to the field’s form.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function showText f  {  window.alert f.elements["textfield"].value ;  }   126  CHAPTER 8  Forms            <input type="button" value="Show text"  onclick="showText this.form ;"  >  Accessing a Text Field  textfield.html   Figure 8.1 shows what happens if a user enters some text in the field and then clicks on the button.  Figure 8.1 The text appears after the button is clicked.  NOTE: This approach—using the value property to access the data in the form field—also works for hidden fields    .  Accessing Check Boxes  f.elements["chkbox"].checked ?   "checked." : "not checked."  An HTML check box knows only two states: checked and not checked. So when you’re working with   Accessing Radio Buttons  127  JavaScript, accessing this state is the most commonly used scenario. The checked property of the check box is a Boolean value returning true if the check box is checked, and false otherwise.The following code shows this in context:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function showStatus f  {  window.alert "The checkbox is " +   f.elements["chkbox"].checked ?  "checked." : "not checked."  ;  }           <input type="button" value="Show status"  onclick="showStatus this.form ;"  >  Accessing a Check Box  checkbox.html   Accessing Radio Buttons  var btn = f.elements["radiobutton"][i]; s += btn.value + ": " + btn.checked + "\n";  Unlike check boxes, HTML radio buttons always come in groups.That means that several radio buttons may have the same name attribute, but differ in their value attributes.Therefore, document.forms[number]. elements[radiobuttongroup] accesses the whole group   128  CHAPTER 8  Forms  of radio buttons—that is, it is an array. Every sub- element of this array is a radio button and supports the checked property.This property works analogous to the check box’s checked property: true means that the radio button is activated, and false stands for the opposite. Access to the value of every button is possible, as well: the value property takes care of that. The following code iterates through all radio buttons and outputs their state:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function showStatus f  {  var s = ""; for  var i=0; i<f.elements["radiobutton"].length;  i++  { var btn = f.elements["radiobutton"][i]; s += btn.value + ": " + btn.checked + "\n";  } window.alert s ;  }      <input type="radio" name="radiobutton"  <input type="radio" name="radiobutton"  <input type="radio" name="radiobutton"  value="R"  >red  value="G"  >green  value="B"  >blue  <input type="button" value="Show status"  onclick="showStatus this.form ;"  >     Accessing a Group of Radio Buttons  radiobutton.html    Accessing Selection Lists  129  Accessing Selection Lists  var index = f.elements["selectionlist"]  cid:1 .selectedIndex;  An HTML selection list consists of two elements:   lays the foundation and provides the name of the whole list  in its name attribute .The actual list ele- ments are represented by   elements and pro- vide two things: a caption  the data shown in the browser  and the value  the data sent to the server when the form is submitted . When you’re working with JavaScript, two ways of accessing the list data are available:  n selectedIndex provides the index  starting at 0  of  the currently selected list element; a value of -1 means that no value has been selected  applicable only for lists with size greater than 1 .  n options is an array with all list options. Every  option supports the selected property.When true, the list option is selected.  Usually, selectedIndex is good enough for validation purposes.The options approach comes in quite handy when the selected list element will be accessed, as well. Then, the value attribute of the selected option pro- vides the data sent to the server, and the text property returns the caption visible in the browser. The following listing accesses all important informa- tion regarding the selected option:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function showStatus f  {   130  CHAPTER 8  Forms  var index = f.elements["selectionlist"]   cid:1 .selectedIndex;  if  index == -1  {  } else {   cid:1 .options[index];  window.alert "No element selected" ;  var element = f.elements["selectionlist"]  window.alert "Element " + index +   "  caption: " + element.text +  ", value: " + element.value +  "  selected" ;  }  }          red   green   blue     <input type="button" value="Show status"  onclick="showStatus this.form ;"  >     Accessing a Selection List  selectionlist.html   NOTE: Recent browsers also support the following shortcut for accessing the value of the currently selected list element: f.elements["selectionlist"].value  However, to maintain maximum browser compatibility, the following approach requires a bit more typing, but also works on older software: f.elements["selectionlist"].options[  f.elements["selectionlist"].selectedIndex].value   Accessing a Multiple Selection List  131  Accessing a Multiple Selection List  s += "Element " + i   + "  " + option.text  + " " + option.value  + "  " +  option.selected ?   "selected." : “not selected."   + "\n”;  When an HTML selection list gets the multiple= "multiple" attribute, more than one element can be selected. In this case, the selectedIndex property does not help very much since it only informs about the first selected element in the list, not all.Therefore, a for loop should be used to iterate over all list elements. When the selected property is true, the list item is selected. The following code outputs information about all list elements, including whether or not they are selected:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function showStatus f  {  var s = ""; var list = f.elements["selectionlist"]; for  var i=0; i<list.options.length; i++  {  var option = list.options[i]; s += "Element " + i   + "  " + option.text  + " " + option.value  + "  " +  option.selected ?   "selected." : "not selected."   + "\n";  } window.alert s ;   132  CHAPTER 8  Forms  }      <select name="selectionlist" size="3"  multiple="multiple">  red   green   blue     <input type="button" value="Show status"  onclick="showStatus this.form ;"  >     Accessing a Multiple Selection List  selectionlistmultiple.html   In Figure 8.2 you can see the result when a few of the elements are selected, but not all.  Figure 8.2 Some elements are selected.   Accessing a Multiple Selection List  133  File Uploads and JavaScript  With JavaScript it is also possible to access file upload HTML elements    . However, in the past few years, web browser developers have restricted the JavaScript access to these kinds of form fields more and more. And there is good reason for that, too. Imagine a hostile JavaScript code that sets the value of the file upload field to, say,  etc passwd and then automatically submits the form.Therefore, this is usually not possible any more. Also, some browsers print out a message whenever files will be uploaded alongside a form  see Figure 8.3 .Therefore, you should avoid controlling form upload fields with JavaScript; with basic HTML and a server-side tech- nology, they do work fine.  Figure 8.3 Konqueror warns about files being  sent with the form.   134  CHAPTER 8  Forms  Disabling Form Elements  f.elements["password"].disabled = true;  Sometimes, form elements should not be modifiable. The following scenarios are just some examples:  n Form elements “abused” just to display data, such  as long license agreements packed into a   field  n Elements being activated or deactivated upon user  interaction  n Data in form elements being “locked” when the  form is being submitted  JavaScript offers several options to achieve this effect. Every form element supports the disabled property. When it’s set to true, the form element grays out and cannot be modified any longer. In the following list- ing, this is shown using a simple login form.This form can also be used for registering a user; when a user wants to register, no password is required.Therefore, the password field must gray out when the form switches into registration mode:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function enable f  {  f.elements["password"].disabled = false;  function disable f  {  f.elements["password"].disabled = true;  }  }     Disabling Form Elements  135     <input type="radio" name="radiobutton"  value="login"checked="checked" onclick="enable this.form ;"  >Login <input type="radio" name="radiobutton"  value="register” onclick="disable this.form ;"  >Register   Username     Password <input type="password"  name="password"  >      Disabling Form Elements  disabled.html   In Figure 8.4, the effect of this code can be seen: the text field grays out when the Register radio button is selected.  Figure 8.4 The password field is now disabled.  Sometimes, the graying-out effect is not desired. An alternative way to disable a form element comes via its readOnly JavaScript property.When this property is set to true, the form field does not change its appearance, but cannot be changed any longer. Here is the code that implements this:   136  CHAPTER 8  Forms  function enable f  {  f.elements["password"].readOnly = false;  }  }  function disable f  {  f.elements[“password"].readOnly = true;  Making Form Elements Read-Only  readonly.html; excerpt   NOTE: In older browsers, another simple trick was used to make text fields in particular read-only. After the field got the focus, it was removed immediately:    WARNING: Even though you can use JavaScript to disable a form field or make it read-only, you should be aware that JavaScript can be easily deactivated and an HTTP request can be trivially forged, as well. So do not rely on this JavaScript effect but always validate your data on the server side!  Submitting a Form  document.forms[0].submit  ;  Usually, a submit button     or a submit image     is used to send form data to the web server. However, JavaScript is capable of submitting a form as well, using the form’s submit   method.This allows programmers to use an HTML link, for instance, to submit a form,   Preventing Form Submission  137  providing more flexibility from a designer’s point of view. However, do keep in mind that the following code works only when JavaScript is activated:             cid:1 Submit form   Submitting a Form  submit.html   Preventing Form Submission     There are some good reasons to hinder the browser from submitting the form, for instance, when some required fields have not been filled out yet.To do so, false must be returned in the handling code for the form’s submit event:     Of course, the code should usually decide based on the form data whether the form should be allowed to sub- mit.Therefore, a custom function usually takes care of that and, at the end, returns true or false. The following form can be submitted only if there is a value in the text field:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function checkform f  {   if  f.elements["textfield"].value == ""  {  138  CHAPTER 8  Forms  return false;  } else {  return true;  }  }      Username         The Form Can Be Submitted Only When the Text Field Is Filled Out  nosubmit.html   Once again, this works only with JavaScript activated—one more reason to validate all data on the server side!  Preventing Repeated Form Submissions     <input type="submit" value="Submit data"  onclick="this.disabled = true;" >     Especially when the script that analyzes form data takes quite some time, users tend to try to speed things up by submitting the form again. However, during online shopping, credit-card payments, and other important transactions, this can be quite expensive. Therefore, the web page itself should try to avoid repeated form submissions.   Preventing Repeated Form Submissions  139  The preceding code  in the file prevent.html in the code downloads for this title  does exactly that:When the submit button has been clicked, the button’s disabled property is set to true, effectively making it impossible to click the button again  if JavaScript is enabled . Figure 8.5 shows the result in the browser: The button grays out.  Figure 8.5 The button cannot be clicked twice.  The preceding listing and the following listing both send the form data to a PHP script called delay.php, which basically waits five seconds and then sends out data.This emulates a slow connection or a slow server, the main scenario for this phrase. Another approach is to maintain the state of the but- ton and thereby determine whether it has already been clicked, as the following listing shows:  <script language="JavaScript"  type=”text javascript">  var submitted = false; function checkform f  {  if  submitted  {  window.alert "Form has already been    cid:1 submitted!" ;  return false;   140  CHAPTER 8  Forms  } else {  submitted = true; return true;  }  }   <form action=”delay.php”   onsubmit="return checkform this ;">       Preventing a Repeated Form Submission Maintaining a Status  prevent-status.html   WARNING: Although this phrase is quite convenient, you have to be aware that sometimes the server unexpectedly closes the connection to the client  or vice versa . Then the data transfer stops, but the JavaScript code cannot know about this. The consequence is that the button cannot be clicked twice  as originally planned , but the data has not been properly transmitted. The user then would have to reload the form to be able to submit the data again.  Giving a Field the Focus  document.forms[0].elements["textfield"].focus  ;  Most search websites like Google have a convenient feature: After the page has been loaded, the cursor is already in the search field.This is quite easily done by the preceding code; the focus   method gives a form field the focus. A full listing is available in the file focus.html.   Selecting Text in a Field  141  WARNING: Note that the larger your page is and the more form fields it has, the more inconvenient this feature may get. Imagine a slowly loading page. While the page is loading, the user is probably already typing in another field. After the page has been fully loaded, the preceding code sets the focus to the designated field, eventually stealing the focus from the field the user is currently working on.  Selecting Text in a Field  field.setSelectionRange 0, field.value.length ;  Sometimes, text fields are prefilled with text explaining to the user what is expected in the field, for instance, in the following fashion:  <input type="text" name="textfield"  value="&lt;Enter data here&gt;"  >  However, this is a bit cumbersome when users try to actually enter something in the field:They have to select the whole text to be able to overwrite the field’s contents. If the text was preselected, this would be easy. All major browsers support selecting text in a field; however, the approach is different.With Internet Explorer, the createTextRange   method of the field must be called, creating a range.The moveStart   and moveEnd   methods define the delimiters of this range; the select   method finally selects the text. Mozilla browsers and Opera and Konqueror KDE, on the other hand, have a different interface for this func- tionality.The setSelectionRange   method selects a field’s contents. Note that setSelectionRange   expects   142  CHAPTER 8  Forms  the length of the range as second parameter, whereas moveEnd   in Internet Explorer expects the position of the last character to select. The following listing selects the whole text in all major browsers and then sets the focus on the field. So if the user starts typing, the initial text is replaced immediately.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  var field = document.forms[0]   cid:1 .elements["textfield"];  if  field.createTextRange  {  var range = field.createTextRange  ; range.moveStart "character", .0 ; range.moveEnd "character", field.value.length - 1 ;  range.select  ;  } else if  field.setSelectionRange  {  field.setSelectionRange 0, field.value.length ;  } field.focus  ;  };         <input type="text" name="textfield"  value="&lt;Enter data here&gt;"  >  Preselecting Text in a Field  selecttext.html   Figure 8.6 shows the result. Note that when this form field is validated later, the default value should not be considered as valid data.   Emptying Text Fields When Clicked Upon  143  Figure 8.6 The text is selected, and the field  has the focus.  TIP: You may consider prefilling the field only if JavaScript is available; otherwise, users without JavaScript would have to manually select  and delete  the standard value of the text field. The following code does the trick: field.value = " ";  Emptying Text Fields When Clicked Upon  if  this.value == originaldata  {  this.value = "";  }  A nice additional feature to the preceding phrase is to clear out the text field if the user clicks into it  because then, the preselection of the text would be gone . However, just adding onclick="this.value=’’;" to the   tag would not be enough. Imagine that the user entered some custom data into the field and then decided to click in it—the text would vanish, and the user probably would too. Therefore, the original text has to be saved upon load- ing of the page. Now when the user clicks in the text   144  CHAPTER 8  Forms  field and the text in it is still the original, the field may be emptied, as the following listing shows:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  var originaldata;  window.onload = function   {  var field = document.forms[0]   cid:1 .elements["textfield”];  originaldata = field.value; if  field.createTextRange  {  var range = field.createTextRange  ; range.moveStart "character", .0 ; range.moveEnd "character", field.value.length - 1 ;  range.select  ;  } else if  field.setSelectionRange  {  field.setSelectionRange 0, field.value.length ;  } field.focus  ; field.onclick = function   {  if  this.value == originaldata  {  this.value = "";  }  };  }         <input type="text" name="textfield"  value="&lt;Enter data here&gt;"  >  Clearing the Field  clear.html   Note that the focus event cannot be used for that task; Internet Explorer would clear out the field immediately   Validating Text Fields  145  upon loading of the document  even though the call to focus   occurs before the event handler is set .  Form Validation  JavaScript is a great tool for validating forms on the fly. It is possible to give users immediate feedback about data they entered  for instance, by using something along the lines of onblur="validateData this ;" , but you have to always consider that JavaScript can be deactivated and HTTP requests must not originate from a web browser. So before you use data from the client, validate it on the server as well. Also, make sure that the form itself works with JavaScript deactivated, since about 10% of users cannot use the scripting language  or do not want to . Finally, validation itself should be only a convenience feature for users, not a nagging tool to squeeze as much data out of a visitor as possible. So use it wisely.  Validating Text Fields  if  field.value.replace  \s g, ""  == ""  {  window.alert "Invalid data!" ; field.focus  ;  } Validation of user-supplied data can come in various flavors. Sometimes it is just important to check whether a mandatory field has been filled out; in other scenarios a thorough data validation has to be done. In the preceding code  file mandatory.html , the data in a text field is checked.The replace   JavaScript   146  CHAPTER 8  Forms  method call globally removes whitespace  regular expression  \s g  in the string and then checks if there is anything left, so that just space characters do not sat- isfy the “fill out this field” condition. In the next listing, the data in the text field is validated against a regular expression—a U.S. postal code:  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function validate field  {  var regex =  ^\d{5}$ ; if  !regex.test field.value   {  window.alert "Invalid postal code!" ; field.value = ""; field.focus  ;  }      US postal code <input type="text" name="code"  onblur="validate this ;"  >  }     Validating a Field Against a Regular Expression   mandatory-regex.html   Validating Check Boxes  if  !f.elements["terms"].checked  {  window.alert "Terms &amp; conditions must be   Âaccepted!" ;  f.elements["terms"].focus  ; return false;  } else {  return true;  }   Validating Radio Buttons  147  When a check box has to be filled out, its checked property must be true; otherwise, the form should not be allowed to be submitted.The preceding code, avail- able in a full listing in the file mandatory-checkbox.html, demonstrates which code could be called when the submit event of the form is fired.  Validating Radio Buttons  if  radio.checked  {  return true;  }  When a group of radio buttons is mandatory, it suffices that one of these buttons is checked  well, it is not pos- sible to check more than one button per group any- way, but there is still the possibility that none of the buttons is selected . Using the elements array of the form, the group of radio buttons can be selected as an array.Within this array, at least one radio button with checked equals true must be found so that the group is considered to be sufficiently filled out.The following listing implements this check:  <script language="JavaScript”   type="text javascript">  function checkform f  {  for  var i=0; i<f.elements["colors"].length;   i++  { var radio = f.elements["colors"][i]; if  radio.checked  {  return true;  }  }    no checked radio button found   148  CHAPTER 8  Forms  window.alert "No color selected!" ; f.elements["colors"][0].focus  ; return false;  }          cid:1 red    cid:1 green    cid:1 blue               Validating a Radio Button Group  mandatory-radio.html   NOTE: You may want to consider a less obtrusive way of pointing the user to the error in the form. For instance, you could use DOM or the Image object to display a small error icon next to all fields that have not been correctly filled out. This is, of course, a possibility for all validation phrases in this chapter.  Validating Selection Lists  if  f.elements["colors"].selectedIndex == -1  {  window.alert "No color selected!" ; f.elements["colors"].focus  ; return false;  } else {  return true;  }   Validating Selection Lists  149  There are several ways to validate a selection list.The easiest one is to check the selectedIndex property. If its value is -1, no item has been selected, and therefore the form has not been filled out sufficiently.The pre- ceding code demonstrates this  full version in file mandatory-list.html . However, this approach works only when the selection list has its size attribute set to a value greater than one and does not contain any empty elements  for demon- stration purposes . A better way to validate a list is to look at the value attributes of all selected elements. If the value is an empty string, the element is not taken into consideration. A for loop iterates over all elements in the list and looks for selected elements with an actual value.This approach has the additional advantage that it also works with multiple selection lists.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function checkform f  {  for  var i=0; i<f.elements["colors"].options   cid:1 .length; i++  {  var element = f.elements["colors"].options[i]; if  element.selected && element.value != ""  {  return true;  }  } window.alert "No color selected!" ; f.elements["colors"].focus  ; return false;  }      <select name=”colors" size="9”   multiple="multiple">   150  CHAPTER 8  Forms   Select a color   red   green   blue   ———-   cyan   magenta   yellow   black           Validating a Selection List  mandatory-list-loop.html   As you can see from Figure 8.7, the two filler elements do not count.  Figure 8.7 The form may be submitted only if a  “real” element has been selected.   Automatically Validating a Form  151  Automatically Validating a Form  switch  element.type   With a bit of effort, JavaScript is capable of automati- cally validating a form, given that all form fields are mandatory.Then, iterating over the form elements does the trick. Each element’s type property returns the type of the field, and Table 8.1 shows a list of the most important ones.Then, depending on the field type, the validation takes place.  The Form Field Types of JavaScript  Table 8.1 Type  button  checkbox  password  radio  reset  submit  text  textarea  select-one  select-multiple  Description HTML button Check box Password field Radio button Reset button Selection list Multiple selection list Submit button Single-line text field Multiline text field  The following code takes special care of radio button groups. Since the loop over the form elements visits every element and therefore every radio button, a list of already-checked radio button groups is maintained.   152  CHAPTER 8  Forms  Otherwise, a group of three radio buttons would be checked three times, generating three error messages if no button has been selected.  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function checkform f  {  var errortext = ""; var checkedgroups = ""; for  var i=0; i<f.elements.length; i++  {  var element = f.elements[i]; switch  element.type  {  if  element.value.replace  \s g, ""  ==   ""  { errortext += element.name + "\n";  case "checkbox":  if  !element.checked  {  errortext += element.name + "\n";  case "text":  case "textarea": case "password":  } break;  } break;  case "radio":  var group = f.elements[element.name]; if  checkedgroups.indexOf "[" +   element.name + "]"  > -1  { continue;  } else {  checkedgroups += "[" + element.name + "]";  } var groupok = false; for  var j=0; j<group.length; j++  {  if  group[j].checked  {   Automatically Validating a Form  153  groupok = true;  } if  !groupok  {  } break;  errortext += element.name + "\n";  case "select-one": case "select-multiple": var selectok = false; for  var j=0; j<element.options.length;   j++  { var item = element.options[j]; if  item.selected && item.value != ""  {  selectok = true;  }  }  errortext += element.name + "\n";  } if  !selectok  {  } break;  }  } if  errortext == ""  {  return true;  } else {  window.alert    cid:1 filled out:\n\n"  + errortext ;  return false;  }  }    Automatically Validating a Form  validate.html; excerpt   "The following fields have not been correctly   154  CHAPTER 8  Forms  Figure 8.8 presents the result: All form fields miss their appropriate content.

Figure 8.8 The form is automatically validated.  Implementing Navigation with a Selection List  var url = list.options[list.selectedIndex].value;  A so-called “quick link” navigation presents a selection list with a couple of navigation elements. After an item in the list has been selected, the browser loads the associated page. Implementation-wise, this nice and widely used effect is rather trivial.The target URLs of all navigation ele- ments are stored in the value attributes; a JavaScript function first checks whether a “real” element has been selected and then loads the URL:   Implementing a Hierarchical Navigation with a Selection List  155  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function loadURL list  {  var url = list.options[list.selectedIndex].value; if  url != ""  {  location.href = url;  }  }          Please select...      cid:1 SAMS       cid:1 H&amp;W blog       cid:1 Damon         A Quick Link Navigation  quicklink.html   Implementing a Hierarchical Navigation with a Selection List  for  var i=0; i<links.length; i++  {  elements["urls"].options[  elements["urls"].options.length] =   new Option links[i].title, links[i].url ;  }  Two selection lists can be paired to provide a hierar- chical navigation on a site.The first selection list   156  CHAPTER 8  Forms  contains several categories; when a category is selected, the second list contains a set of elements in this category. From a JavaScript point of view, a list of elements must be maintained and the lists must be filled according to the selection in the first  category  list. So here is the list of links, in JSON format  see Chapter 11,“AJAX  and Related Topics ” for more information on this notation .  var data = {  "search" : [  {"title": "Google", "url":    cid:1 "http:  www.google.com "}, {"title": "MSN", "url":    cid:1 "http:  search.msn.com "}  ], "browsers" : [  {"title": "Firefox",    cid:1 "url": "http:  www.mozilla.com firefox "},  {"title": "Opera",    cid:1 "url": "http:  www.opera.com "}  ]  };  Then, the following code adds options to the second selection list, by using the Option constructor  syntax: first the caption, then the value :  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function loadElements f  {  with  f  {  var category = elements["categories"].options[ elements["categories"].selectedIndex].value;  if  category != ""  {  var links = data[category];   Implementing a Hierarchical Navigation with a Selection List  157  elements["urls"].options.length = 0; elements["urls"].options[0] =   new Option "Please select...", "" ;  for  var i=0; i<links.length; i++  {  elements["urls"].options[  elements["urls"].options.length] =  new Option links[i].title, links[i].url ;  }  }  }  }      <select name="categories"  onchange="loadElements this.form ;">  Please select...   Search Engines   Browsers             A Hierarchical Navigation  navigation.html; excerpt   Figure 8.9 shows what happens when the first cate- gory  search engines  is selected:The second list fills with available options.  Figure 8.9 Selecting an option in the first list fills  the second list.   158  CHAPTER 8  Forms  Emptying a Set of Radio Buttons  for  var i=0; i<f.elements["colors"].length; i++  {  f.elements["colors"][i].checked = false;  }  One commonly known disadvantage of radio buttons is that after a button in a group is selected, it is impos- sible to remove the selection from the group—at least one button is always selected from then on.With a lit- tle bit of JavaScript, this effect can be mitigated by offering a JavaScript button or link that removes the radio button selection.The preceding code iterates over the radio button group and sets the checked prop- erty of all elements to false  complete code in the file emptyradio.html .  TIP: This issue can also be solved by HTML alone: Just offer a radio button  selected by default  that stands for “no selection,” in the following fashion:  yes  no <input type="radio" name="answer" value=""  checked="checked"  >no answer  Of course, you would then also have to change any valida- tion code.   Creating Prefilled Date Selection Lists  159  Creating Prefilled Date Selection Lists  elements["day"].selectedIndex = d.getDate   - 1;  Most online booking sites have a set of three selection lists allowing users to enter a date: one list for the day, one for the month, and one for the year. Generating these lists, either in static HTML or on the server side, is a rather trivial task; but preselecting them requires server-side means  see the book PHP Phrasebook for a solution in PHP —or a bit of JavaScript.The idea is to set the selectedIndex property of each list to the appropriate date value, as shown in the following list- ing  the selection lists are of course abridged :  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   { with  document.forms[0]  {  var d = new Date  ; elements["day"].selectedIndex = d.getDate   - 1; elements["month"].selectedIndex = d.getMonth  ; elements["year"].selectedIndex = 2006 –   d.getFullYear  ;  }  }          1           January    160  CHAPTER 8  Forms           2006           Prefilling a Date List  autodate.html; excerpt   WARNING: In the example, the first year in the list is 2006; this value is also used for calculating the required selectedIndex for that date. If you change that, for instance add the year 2007, you have to change the for- mula for elements[“year”].selectedIndex accordingly.  Creating Validating Date Selection Lists  f.elements["day"].options.length = maxDays;  The next step for the date selection lists from the pre- vious phrase consists of taking care of users entering a valid date. So, whenever there is a change in the month or in the year, the day selection list must be updated appropriately:  <select name="month"  onchange="updateDay this.form ;">  <select name="year"  onchange="updateDay this.form ;">  To do so, a helper function  see Chapter 6  determines whether a year is a leap year:   Creating Validating Date Selection Lists  161  function isLeapYear y  { return  y % 4 == 0 &&    y % 100 != 0  y % 400 == 0  ;  }  With this information, the day selection list can be updated. If there are too many entries, the list is short- ened. If there are too few entries, the list gets addi- tional entries. All this maintains the selectedIndex value, if possible, so that the user’s selection is main- tained  unless, for instance, day 30 is selected and the month changed to February .  <script language="JavaScript"  type="text javascript">  function updateDay f  {  var oldDays = f.elements["day"].options.length; var month = parseInt f.elements["month"].value ; var year = parseInt f.elements["year"].value ;  case 1: case 3: case 5: case 7: case 9: case 11:  var maxDays = 30;  switch  month  {  maxDays = 31; break;  case 2:  maxDays =  isLeapYear year  ? 29 : 28 ; break;  }  f.elements["day"].options.length = maxDays; if  maxDays > oldDays  {  for  var i=oldDays; i<maxDays; i++  {  f.elements["day"].options[i] =   new Option i+1, i+1 ;   162  CHAPTER 8  Forms  }  }  }    Automatically Updating the List  date.html; excerpt   In Figure 8.10 you can see the result: February of the year 2000 had 29 days.  Figure 8.10 The day list is updated according  to month and year.   9 Windows and Frames  Windows are playing an important role in JavaScript.  The window object is the default object in JavaScript and is used quite often  just consider the windows.alert   method . Also, JavaScript is capable of working with windows  for instance, by opening new ones —and also with frames and iframes, which are also very similar to window objects.  window.open "http:  www.samspublishing.com ",  "samsWindow", "" ;  The method window.open   opens a new window and expects at least three parameters so that the method call is useful: the URL to open, the new name of the window, and window options. With the preceding code  file open.html , a new win- dow is opened with the publisher’s homepage opened. The second parameter of the open   method provides the name of the new window.This works exactly as a frame name: If you use the window name as the target attribute for a link, the link opens in the new window.   164  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  Therefore, the open.html sample file also contains a link that is using the new window name:  <a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product   cid:1 0672328801" target="samsWindow">This book   cid:1 at Amazon   When you click on that link, no new window is opened but the old window, previously opened by JavaScript, is reused. Note that the return value of window.open   is a JavaScript window object pointing to the new win- dow. So code in the following fashion does not lead to the desired result:   Open window   Since the method returns a window object, this link would write something like [object]  Internet Explorer  or [object Window]  Mozilla browsers  to the page.Therefore, you must make sure that the JavaScript code does not return anything. A good way to achieve this is via the following code:   Open   cid:1 window   Using Window Options  window.open "http:  www.samspublishing.com ",  "samsWindow", "width=640,height=480,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes" ;  The third parameter of window.open   is a list of comma-separated values that define how the new   Using Window Options  165  window looks.You can define the size  as long as both width and height are at least 100 pixels , toggle some window features like the status bar, and more. Table 9.1 shows the most important options  however, the list is not complete, leaving out several browser- dependent options . The preceding code uses some of these options. Some take numeric values; some require yes or no as their values.Take care that you do not use spaces between options.  Table 9.1 Window Options Option  dependent  directories  height  innerHeight  innerWidth  left  location  menubar  outerHeight  outerWidth  resizeable  Description Closes the new window if the parent window is closed Toggles the personal toolbar Height of the window Height of the window excluding the window decoration  non-IE only  Width of the window excluding the window decoration  non-IE only  Horizontal position of the window  IE only  Toggles the location bar Toggles the menu bar Height of the window  non-IE only  Width of the window  non-IE only  Whether the window may be resized by the user   166  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  Table 9.1 Continued Option  scrollbars  screenX  screenY  status  toolbar  top  width  z-lock  Description Horizontal position of the window  non-IE only  Vertical position of the window  non-IE only  Toggles the scrollbars Toggles the status bar Toggles the toolbar Vertical position of the window  IE only  Width of the window Gives the window a lower z-lock  position on the z axis  value  WARNING: You cannot expect all of these effects to work on all browsers in an identical fashion. For instance, the Opera browser opens a new window not in a new browser window, but  depending on the browser version  in a new tab, which of course has the default window decoration and the default window size.  Figure 9.1 shows how the newly opened window  file openoptions.html  looks with the given options.   Opening a Modal Window  167  Figure 9.1 The new window has only very  little decoration.  Opening a Modal Window  window.showModalDialog   "http:  www.samspublishing.com ", "samsWindow", "dialogWidth=640,dialogHeight=480,status=no,   cid:1 center=yes" ;  Both major browsers support some proprietary exten- sions to the window object, but for obvious reasons these are not covered here. However, there is one exception: Internet Explorer is capable of creating modal windows, something that is quite common in intranet applications in which the browser type can be mandated by the IT staff.   168  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  The method associated with that is window. showModalDialog  , expecting a URL, a name, and a set of options  which you will find listed in Table 9.2 . The following listing opens such a dialog, centers it, and gives it a size of 640×480 pixels.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript”>  if  window.showModalDialog  {  window.showModalDialog   "http:  www.samspublishing.com ", "samsWindow", "dialogWidth=640,dialogHeight=480,status=no,   cid:1 center=yes" ; }   <a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product   cid:1 0672328801" target="samsWindow">This   cid:1 book at Amazon   Opening a Modal Window  modal.html   Table 9.2 Window Options Option center  dialogHeight  dialogLeft  dialogTop  dialogWidth  help  status  resizeable  Description Centers the window Height of the window Horizontal position of the window Vertical position of the window Width of the window Toggles the help symbol in the top-right corner Toggles the status bar Whether the window may be resized by the user   Determining Screen Size  169  Figure 9.2 shows the modal window produced by the preceding code.  Figure 9.2 The modal window  Internet Explorer only .  Determining Screen Size  window.alert screen.availWidth + " x " +   screen.availHeight + " pixels" ;  In an ideal world, all web layouts would be flexible and would adapt to the currently available solution. Unfor- tunately, this is not the case, but you may be able to adapt with JavaScript. The screen object  window.screen in recent browsers; just screen in older ones  provides information about the current screen resolution.The properties you   170  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  will be interested in are availableHeight and availableWidth, providing the height and the width available.This can, for instance, be used for determin- ing the current resolution and redirecting to a page suitable for those screen dimensions. The preceding code  file screen.html  determines the current available screen space. Figure 9.3 shows the result using a 1024×768-pixel solution.  Figure 9.3 The screen dimensions may not be  what you expected.  NOTE: Note that in the specific example 30 pixels are missing—they “belong” to the Microsoft Windows bar  similar effects are achieved when this code sample is run on other systems with system bars . If you are interested in the actual width and height, use the width and height properties of the screen object.  Determining the Window Size  with  document.body  {  window.alert clientWidth + " x " +   clientHeight + " pixels" ;  }  Accessing the properties of the current window largely depends on the browser used. As is often the case with   Determining the Window Size  171  JavaScript, the browser world is divided into two groups: Internet Explorer and the rest.With Internet Explorer, the width of a window can be determined via document.body.clientWidth; other browsers use window.innerWidth for the “inner” width  excluding window decoration  and window.outerWidth for the “outer” width  including window decoration . For determining the height, just replace width and Width with height and Height, respectively. The following code outputs the current window’s dimensions:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  if  window.innerWidth  {  window.alert "inner: " + window.innerWidth +   " x " + window.innerHeight +  " pixels\nouter: " + window.outerWidth +  " x " + window.outerHeight + " pixels" ;  } else {  with  document.body  {  window.alert clientWidth + " x " +   clientHeight + " pixels" ;  }  }  }       Determining the Current Window’s Dimensions  dimensions.html   TIP: Note that the page needs a   area and the code must not be executed before the page has been fully loaded for the code to work in Internet Explorer.   172  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  Resizing a Window  window.resizeTo 640, 480 ;  There are several ways to set a window’s size.When opening a window using window.open  , you just have to set the width and height options. For existing win- dows, however, JavaScript offers two methods of the window object:  n resizeTo   sets the width and the height of the window to the provided values, as the preceding code  file resizeto.html in the download archive  shows.  n resizeBy   changes the width and the height of  the window by adding the provided values, as the following listing shows  which cuts both the width and the height in half :  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  var width, height; if  window.innerWidth  {  width = window.outerWidth; height = window.outerHeight;  } else {  width = document.body.clientWidth; height = document.body.clientHeight;  } window.resizeBy   -Math.round width   2 ,  -Math.round height   2  ;  }   Repositioning a Window  173        Bisecting a Window’s Width and Height  resizeby.html   WARNING: Resizing a window is considered more or less unfriendly. One of the principles of the Web is that the size of the client is irrelevant and can be adjusted by the user. So use the technique in this phrase wisely. Also note that you cannot resize the window to a width or height lower than 100 pixels.  Repositioning a Window  window.moveBy -10, 10 ;  When opening a new window, you have to take all browsers into account: For Internet Explorer, set the left and top options; all other browsers work with screenX and screenY.The following window.open   call creates a window in the top-left corner of the screen.  window.open   "anypage.html", "name", "left=0,top=0,screenX=0,screenY=0" ;  However, for existing windows, two methods that are quite similar to the previous phrase come into play: n moveTo   positions the window at the specified  place, as the code at the beginning of this phrase  in file moveto.html  shows.   174  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  n moveBy   moves the window by a certain delta.  The following listing moves the window 10 pixels to the left and 10 pixels down.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.moveBy -10, 10 ;    Moving a Window  moveby.html   WARNING: Moving a window is almost as unfriendly as resizing it, so once again, use this capability wisely. Also note that you cannot move the window completely out of the user’s sight, for obvious security reasons.  Opening a Centered Pop-Up Window  newwin.moveTo   Math.round  screenwidth - windowwidth    2 , Math.round  screenheight - windowheight    2  ;  Combining the phrases to open a window, determin- ing its dimensions, and repositioning it enable you to create a new window that is centered on the page. The idea is to calculate the width and height of the new window  remember that window.open   returns a reference to the new window  and then determine the screen size, and from that to calculate the required position of the window so that it is centered.   Opening a Centered Pop-Up Window  175  However, timing is crucial here. On Internet Explorer you can access the window dimensions only after the   element has been parsed.Therefore, a small trick is used: First, the new window is empty.Then, document.write   creates a   element.Then, the window width and height can be read. Finally, the desired document is loaded in the new window, which is then repositioned to the center of the screen.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var newwin = window.open "", "samsWindow", "" ; newwin.document.write "  " ;  var windowwidth, windowheight; if  window.innerWidth  {  windowwidth = newwin.outerWidth; windowheight = newwin.outerHeight;  } else {  windowwidth = newwin.document.body.clientWidth; windowheight = newwin.document.body.clientHeight;  } var screenwidth = screen.availWidth; var screenheight = screen.availHeight; newwin.moveTo   Math.round  screenwidth - windowwidth    2 , Math.round  screenheight - windowheight    2  ;  newwin.location.href =   "http:  www.samspublishing.com ";        Opening and Centering a Window  center.html    176  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  NOTE: Sometimes, reading the window properties does not work as planned in Internet Explorer and yields false results. In that case, it is better to set the size of the new window in the window.open   call and then use this  known as true  value to center the new window.  Opening a Full-Screen Window  newwin.resizeTo screen.width, screen.height ; newwin.moveTo 0, 0 ;  Internet Explorer 4 supports the window.open   option fullscreen=yes, but a more general approach is of course to read out the screen object for the system’s dimensions and then resize the window appropriately. Do not forget to reposition it in the top-left corner of the screen!  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript"> var newwin = window.open   "http:  www.samspublishing.com ", "samsWindow", "directories=no,menubar=no,toolbar=no,   cid:1 scrollbars=yes" ; newwin.resizeTo screen.width, screen.height ; newwin.moveTo 0, 0 ;    Opening a Full-Screen Window  center.html    Opening a New Window in a Corner of the Screen  177  Opening a New Window in a Corner of the Screen  newwin.moveTo   screenwidth - windowwidth,  screenheight - windowheight ;  Opening a window in the top-left corner of the screen is rather easy: Just provide 0 as the horizontal and ver- tical position:  <script language="JavaScript"   type=”text javascript"> var newwin = window.open   “http:  www.samspublishing.com ", "samsWindow", "width=640,height=480,directories=no,menubar=no,  cid:1 toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes,left=0,top=0,screenX=0,  cid:1 screenY=0" ;    Opening a Window in the Top-Left Corner  open_topleft.html   All other corners on the screen are a bit more difficult since you have to calculate the positions.Thanks to the screen object, this dilemma can be solved with a small amount of code.The following code positions the new window in the bottom-left corner; listings for the other two corners are available in the files open_topright.html and open_bottomleft.html.  <script language="JavaScript”   type=”text javascript"> var newwin = window.open   "http:  www.samspublishing.com ",   178  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  "samsWindow", "width=640,height=480,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes" ; var windowwidth = 640; var windowheight = 480; var screenwidth = screen.availWidth; var screenheight = screen.availHeight; newwin.moveTo   screenwidth - windowwidth,  screenheight - windowheight ;     Opening a Window in the Bottom-Right Corner  open_bottomright.html   Creating a Sitemap  this.opener.name = "mainWindow";  A sitemap is very convenient on any website.With a bit of JavaScript, this feature can get even better. If you open a sitemap in a new window, you of course want all the links in a sitemap to open up in the origi- nal window. Obviously, this can be done by setting the target attribute of all HTML links  or use   . However, one question remains:Which is the window name? One way to answer this question is to use JavaScript in the main window and set the window’s name property:  this.name = "mainWindow";  Another way is to use the sitemap and reference the opening window from there.This is done by the   Closing a Window  179  opener property of the window, which is set to the parent window of the current window  if there is any parent .The following code is the complete sitemap:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  this.opener.name = "mainWindow";   <a href="http:  www.samspublishing.com "  target="mainWindow">Publisher    <a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product   cid:1 0672328801" target="mainWindow">This   cid:1 book at Amazon   The Sitemap  sitemapwindow.html; excerpt   And this listing opens the sitemap:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.open   "sitemapwindow.html", "sitemap", "width=320,height=100,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes" ;    Opening the Sitemap  sitemap.html; excerpt   Closing a Window  if  !newwindow.closed  newwindow.close  ;  Closing a window can be done by calling the win- dow’s close   method. However, by default this is   180  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  possible only for windows that were opened using JavaScript; if you try this on other windows, the user gets a warning message similar to the one shown in Figure 9.4  Mozilla browsers have a similar message, but hide it in the JavaScript console .  Figure 9.4 Close only the windows opened with JavaScript—or cope with this frightening message.  With the sitemap from the previous phrase, a link to close the window comes in handy:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  this.opener.name = "mainWindow";   <a href="http:  www.samspublishing.com "  target="mainWindow">Publisher    <a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product   cid:1 0672328801" target="mainWindow">This book   cid:1 at Amazon    Close window   The Sitemap with the Close Link  sitemapwindow.html   However, you should also close the sitemap from the main window if another page is loaded there. In the current example, loading any other page in the main window redirects the browser off to another web   Checking for the Presence of a Pop-Up Blocker  181  server; therefore, you can close the sitemap immedi- ately. But before doing so, you should check whether the window is already closed, by taking a look at its closed property:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var newwindow = window.open   “sitemapwindow.html", "sitemap", "width=320,height=100,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no,scrollbars=yes" ;   <body onunload="if  !newwindow.closed    cid:1 newwindow.close  ;">   Opening the Sitemap with the Auto-Closing Feature  sitemapwindow.html   Checking for the Presence of a Pop-Up Blocker  var newwindow = window.open   "", "popupcheck", "width=100,height=100,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no" ;  Admittedly, all the previous phrases relied on the fact that the browser can open pop-ups. By default, most modern browsers allow pop-ups that are opened from the local server, but block pop-ups that are opened from the Internet. Also, various toolbars with their own pop-up blocking mechanism make the life of developers who rely on pop-ups harder.   182  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  The bad news first:There is no reliable way to ensure that pop-ups can always be opened. Some blockers support various levels of blocking, some of them allowing certain kinds of pop-ups, some of them dis- abling all pop-ups. Figure 9.5 shows a typical browser configuration screen.  Figure 9.5 A pop-up blocker configuration.  The following code tries to detect whether a pop-up blocker is available: It opens a window and then checks whether it is there. If yes, it will be closed; otherwise, a pop-up blocker is most probably present:   Checking for the Presence of a Pop-Up Blocker  183  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var newwindow = window.open   "", "popupcheck", "width=100,height=100,directories=no,menubar=no,   cid:1 toolbar=no" ; if  newwindow  {  newwindow.close  ;  } else {  }    window.alert "Pop-up blocker detected!" ;  Checking for a Pop-Up Blocker  popupcheck.html   Figure 9.6 shows the result when a pop-up is blocked  also visible from the notification bar on top of the browser’s content area .  Figure 9.6 A pop-up blocker has been detected.  TIP: The default behavior of most pop-up blockers is that those pop-ups are allowed that are triggered by a user action. So do not try to call window.open   when the   184  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  page has loaded, but rather call window.open   when the user clicks on something. But still you have no guarantee that the pop-up will actually appear.  Using JavaScript Frames  Working with frames from JavaScript is quite similar to working with the window object. Although frames miss some features a window object has, such as the open   method or ways to resize or reposition it, the basic properties of a frame are the same:The document prop- erty points to the document object that is loaded in the frame, and there are further properties like location. The frames property of the main window  where the HTML document with the   element resides  is an array with all frames defined in that frameset.You can then access the frames either via their index  zero-based: window.frames[0], window.frames[1], …  or via their name attribute: window.frames["nameOfFrame"]. From every individual frame document  that is, docu- ments that are loaded within a frame, even if they con- tain   elements as well , the frame structure can be accessed: parent references the document of the parent frame structure, whereas top jumps to the main document.   Changing the Contents of Two Frames at Once  185  Changing the Contents of Two Frames at Once  top.frames[frame1].location.href = url1; top.frames[frame2].location.href = url2;  One of the most common questions regarding JavaScript is how to change two frames at once. Although frames are becoming more and more unpopular among professional web developers, this question is still a hot topic. Of course, JavaScript can come to the rescue. A func- tion expects the names or indexes of the two frames, and of course the two URLs to load. Since the indi- vidual frames are changing during the course of the application, this function should be placed in the frameset document:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function changeFrames frame1, url1, frame2, url2  {  top.frames[frame1].location.href = url1; top.frames[frame2].location.href = url2;  }              The Frameset with the JavaScript Function  frameset.html   The left frame in this example is the navigation frame; the right frame is the content frame.When a link in the navigation frame is being clicked, both frames   186  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  change, since every page in the right frame has an associated navigation page  with the current page highlighted  for the left frame.  Frame 1  <a href="javascript:top.changeFrames 'navigation',   cid:1 'frame1b.html', 'content', 'frame2b.html' ;">  cid:1 Frame 2   The Frameset with the Navigation  frame1a.html   A more general approach does not limit the number of frames to two, but just accepts an arbitrary number of frame names and URLs:  function changeFrames   {  for  var i=0;   i < Math.ceil changeFrames.arguments.length 2 ; i++  { top.frames[changeFrames.arguments[2 * i]]   cid:1 .location.href =   changeFrames.arguments[2 * i + 1];  }  }  The Frameset with the More Flexible JavaScript Function  frameset.html; excerpt   The file frameset.html in the download archive con- tains both versions of changeFrames  , with the less flexible one within a JavaScript comment.  TIP: Of course, this example works best if users without JavaScript are not excluded. So one approach would be to load a new page in the content frame, but use JavaScript to change the left frame as well, if the browser supports it:   Using Iframes  187  <a href="frame2b" target="content"  onclick="top.changeFrames ‘navigation’,  ‘frame1b.html’, ‘content’, ‘frame2b.html’ ;  return false;">Frame 2   Using Hidden Frames for Data Storage  One quite convenient usage option for frames is to use hidden frames.This can, for instance, be used to store data across HTTP requests. Since all JavaScript data is lost if the page is unloaded, a hidden frame comes in handy to store data, for instance when creating a client-side shopping cart. So all you have to do is create a frame with the height equal to one pixel or similar.Then, whenever you have to store away data, you just access the frame and save the required data in variables that are all accessible as properties of that frame:  top.frames["hiddenJsFrame"].variable = "value";  In a similar fashion, you can obviously also put com- mon functions within that frame and then call them in a similar fashion:  top.frames["hiddenJsFrame"].functionName  ;  Using Iframes  window.frames["iframe1"].location.href =   document.getElementById "iframe1" .src =   "iframe1b.html";  "iframe1b.html";   188  CHAPTER 9 Windows and Frames  Iframes, or inline frames, are a very convenient way to create a section within a page that can be changed independently of the rest of the page. As the name already suggests, iframes are very similar to frames; however, some subtle changes exist. Here is the HTML markup for such an inline frame:  <iframe src="iframe1a.html" name="iframe1a"   id="iframe1">   Note that both a name and an ID are provided for the iframe, since there are two ways to approach the frame:  n Using the name and the window.frames array n Using the ID and document.getElementById    The former approach requires the location.href prop- erty to change the URL within the iframe; the latter approach returns an object that has an src property for that task:  n window.frames["iframe1"].location.href =  n document.getElementById "iframe1" .src =   "iframe1b.html";  "iframe1b.html";  WARNING: Although iframes offer new capabilities for web applications, they also have their disadvantages. As you will see in Chapter 11, “AJAX  and Related Topics ,” bookmarking and letting the back and forward buttons work as expected require some workaround—and these hacks work only when JavaScript is activated.   10 Web Services  Web Services are an amazing technology—on the  server side. So what does this have to do with client- side JavaScript? Well, there is a way to call server-side scripts from the client side. Actually, there are two ways: one for Mozilla-based browsers, one for Internet Explorer.These two options are covered in this chap- ter; the next chapter then provides you with some interesting alternatives to the methods presented in this chapter.  Understanding Web Services  Some people say Web Services are just old wine in new bottles because the idea behind this is far from new.The basic principle is that two machines talk to each other. For instance, one machine contains some business logic or, more generally, some information, and the other machine requests this information  or wants to use the business logic . This has been done for many years, but only a few years ago the major players sat together and started to work on protocols to put the whole communication   190  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  on top of standards. Some of these standards are now under the aegis of the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C , whereas others are managed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards  OASIS  consortium. A multitude of books are available on Web Services, with quite a lot of pages. However, in accordance with the concept of this phrasebook, this chapter keeps it simple but still gives you all you need to know. A pro- tocol is used to transfer both the request to the Web Service and its response.There are several possibilities, but these three are the most common:  n XML-RPC stands for XML Remote Procedure Call. XML-RPC uses a simple XML dialect to transport function calls, parameters, and return values.  n REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST basically uses HTTP requests  GET most of the time, but other HTTP verbs are also possible  as a Web Services call.The data returned via REST is plain XML.  n SOAP once stood for Simple Object Access  Protocol, but because it is neither simple nor has too much to do with object access, today SOAP just stands for SOAP. It is a rather complex proto- col but it overcomes many of the limitations of XML-RPC  which was, by the way, created by some parties who also worked on SOAP .  There are some fierce debates about which is better, this protocol or the next one.To make a short and ugly story short: All have advantages  and disadvantages .   Understanding Web Services  191  Most of the time, REST or XML-RPC or SOAP calls are transported via HTTP as the carrier protocol. However, other protocols are also possible, including Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  SMTP  or even User Datagram Protocol  UDP . There is one more important aspect regarding using SOAP.When you know exactly how a Web Service is implemented, you also know how to call  access, or consume  it. However, many times this information is not available, so there must be a kind of self-description of the Web Service that contains all relevant informa- tion, such as which methods or functions are exposed, which parameters and data types they expect, and what they return.This can be done using a specifically crafted XML file as well.The standard behind that is Web Services Description Language  WSDL .Today, WSDL is used for all relevant Web Services because it makes using Web Services quite simple. Most server- side technologies offer one  or more  means to just read in the WSDL and then access the Web Service like you would access a locally available class. Using all this XML can become quite complicated. The next chapter covers XML as one of the aspects of the AJAX technology and gives you additional point- ers. However, Mozilla browsers and Microsoft Internet Explorer feature their own way to access Web Services. This removes at least a bit of the complexity, but unfortunately it is not browser-agnostic.   192  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  Creating a Web Service with PHP  $soap = new SoapServer   'RandomNumberService.wsdl', array 'uri' =>   'http:  javascript.phrasebook.org '    ;  So that the Web Service can be used, we first need one.The most popular server-side technology at the moment is PHP  PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor , so this is the obvious choice for implementing a Web Service. For this to work, you need a web server with PHP installed. Many affordable web hosting packages come with PHP nowadays, and PHP can also be installed on most types of web server.You can down- load the PHP distribution and source from its home- page, http:  www.php.net . For this to work, you will need PHP 5 or later, and you have to enable the SOAP library that comes with it. On UNIX Linux, you have to compile PHP with the configuration switch --enable-soap; users of Windows have to add the following line to the php.ini configuration file:  extension=php_soap.dll  Also, you need a WSDL file—that’s a description for the Web Service, including which methods it exposes and which parameters it expects.The file RandomNumberService.wsdl contains all this information. Make sure that you look for the section <soap:address location=”http:  localhost js webservice.php”  > of the WSDL and adapt the URL to your local system.   Creating a Web Service with ASP.NET  193  Then, the following script implements a simple SOAP Web Service with one method  that returns a random number within a given interval :  <?php  $soap = new SoapServer   'RandomNumberService.wsdl', array 'uri' =>   'http:  javascript.phrasebook.org '    ; $soap->setClass 'ServiceClass' ; $soap->handle  ;  class ServiceClass {  function randomNumber $lower, $upper  {  return rand $lower, $upper ;  }  }  ?>  A PHP Web Service  webservice.php   Creating a Web Service with ASP.NET  <%@ WebService language="C"   class="RandomNumberService" %>  One of the web technologies with the highest growth rate nowadays is ASP.NET from Microsoft. One of the nice features of the technology is that creating and using Web Services is a rather easy task.   194  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  To implement a Web Service, a file with the extension .asmx must be created on the web server.Then, the    directive must be on top of the page. All methods that will be exposed as Web Services methods must be prefixed with the [WebMethod] attrib- ute. Here is a complete example:  <%@ WebService language="C"   class="RandomNumberService" %>  using System; using System.Web.Services;  [WebService Namespace=  cid:1 "http:  javascript.phrasebook.org " ] public class RandomNumberService {  [WebMethod] public int randomNumber int lower, int upper  {  Random r = new Random  ; return r.Next lower, upper + 1 ;  }  }  An ASP.NET Web Service  webservice.asmx   When you call this page from an ASP.NET-enabled web server in your web browser, you will get  depend- ing on your configuration  a nice information page that gives you some details about the service. If you append ?WSDL to the URL, you get a WSDL descrip- tion, automatically generated from ASP.NET. Figure 10.1 shows how that looks.   Calling a Web Service from Internet Explorer  195  Figure 10.1 The automatically generated detail  page for the ASP.NET Web Service.  Calling a Web Service from Internet Explorer  WebService.useService "webservice.php?WSDL",  "RandomNumberService" ;  Some years ago, Microsoft provided a helper script to access a Web Service from an HTML page using JavaScript. For this to work, the Web Service must reside on the same server as the JavaScript code. Unfortunately, Microsoft stopped development of this component and hid it deep in the Microsoft Developers Network  MSDN . However, it is still available and it works fine. Go to http:  msdn. microsoft.com archive en-us samples internet  behaviors library webservice default.asp, download the file webservice.htc, and put the file in the directory where your HTML file will reside  the webservice.htc file is not part of the source code   196  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  download for this book .Then, the following markup loads the component:  <div id="WebService"   style="behavior:url webservice.htc ;">  Then, WebService references the component and allows you to load a remote Web Service  useService   method , providing its WSDL description.The compo- nent then enables JavaScript code to call a web method  callService   method, providing a callback function, a method name, and parameters . In the callback function, the result can be analyzed or just printed out, as the following sample code shows:        JavaScript  <script language="Javascript"   type="text javascript">  function callWebService f  {  WebService.useService "webservice.php?WSDL",  "RandomNumberService" ;  WebService.RandomNumberService.callService   callbackFunction, "randomNumber", parseInt f.elements["lower"].value , parseInt f.elements["upper"].value  ;  function callbackFunction result  {  document.getElementById "random" .innerHTML =   result.value;  }  }          Calling a Web Service from Internet Explorer  197  <div id="WebService"   style="behavior:url webservice.htc ;">       A number between  <input type="text" name="lower" size="3"   <input type="text" name="upper" size="3"   value="1"  > and  value="49"  > is     <input type="button" value="Retrieve"   onclick="callWebService this.form ;"  >          Calling Web Services from Internet Explorer  webservice-ie-php.html   Figure 10.2 shows the result:The random number comes from the Web Service on the web server.  NOTE: The preceding listing covers calling the PHP web service; the file webservice-ie-aspnet.html deals with the ASP.NET Web Service. The only change is that the name of the Web Service’s URL has been changed; the rest of the code remains the same.  Figure 10.2 The random number comes from  the Web Service.   198  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  Calling a Web Service from a Mozilla Browser  var soapcall = new SOAPCall  ;  The Mozilla browsers support their own ways of call- ing Web Services.The JavaScript SOAPCall class can take care of creating the SOAP request. After instanti- ating the class, you have to set a couple of properties: the SOAP action  a SOAP header field, often the namespace of the Web Service plus the method name  and the absolute URI  including the name of the server  of the Web Service:  var soapcall = new SOAPCall  ; soapcall.actionURI =   "http:  javascript.phrasebook.org randomNumber";  soapcall.transportURI =   "http:  localhost js webservice.php";  Next, you create an array of all parameters you want to use in the Web Service call, by instantiating the SOAPParameter class:  var parameters = [  new SOAPParameter 1, "lower" , new SOAPParameter 49, "upper"   ];  Then, the encode   method prepares the Web Service call.The following parameters are expected:  n SOAP version  0 stands for SOAP 1.1 and is  recommended   n Name of the Web Service method to call n Namespace of the Web Service   Calling a Web Service from a Mozilla Browser  199  n Additional SOAP headers to send  as an array  n Number of parameters to send n Parameters to send  as an array   The asyncInvoke   method actually calls the Web Service; you can provide a callback function that gets executed when the data comes back from the Web Service.This is an XML document, so you have to use the DOM to access the important information.The following code usually works:  function callbackFunction result  {  var returnData =    cid:1 result.body.firstChild.firstChild.firstChild.data; }  Here is the complete code:        JavaScript  <script language="Javascript"   type="text javascript">  function callWebService f  {  var soapcall = new SOAPCall  ; soapcall.actionURI =    cid:1 "http:  javascript.phrasebook.org randomNumber";  soapcall.transportURI =   "http:  localhost js webservice.php";  var parameters = [  new SOAPParameter parseInt   f.elements["lower"].value , "lower" ,  new SOAPParameter parseInt   f.elements["upper"].value , "upper”   ];   200  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  soapcall.encode   0, “randomNumber”, "http:  javascript.phrasebook.org ", 0, [], parameters.length, parameters   ; soapcall.asyncInvoke callbackFunction ;  function callbackFunction result  {  document.getElementById "random” .innerHTML =  result.body.firstChild.firstChild.firstChild  }   cid:1 .data;  }                    A number between  <input type="text" name="lower" size="3"   <input type="text" name="upper" size="3”   value="1"  > and  value=”49"  > is     <input type="button" value="Retrieve"   onclick="callWebService this.form ;"  >  Calling a Web Service from Mozilla  webservice-mozilla-php.html    Calling an ASP.NET Web Service from a Mozilla Browser  201  NOTE: Again, do note that you may have to change the URL for the Web Service call so that it fits your system.  Calling an ASP.NET Web Service from a Mozilla Browser  var schematype = schemacoll.getType   "integer", "http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"   ;  There is one potential issue with the preceding code: The data types for the parameters sent to the Web Service are not provided. Unfortunately, some Web Service implementations require this information to work. Most notably, some .NET Web Services do not work without this information. It is hard to say who is to blame for that, Microsoft or Mozilla, but at least there is a way to make these two systems cooperate.To do so, you have to change the way the parameters are created. After instantiating the SOAPCall class, you have to load the correct encoding for each parameter. In the example, the data type used is integer, so that’s what we are using.The parameters array is now created in the following fashion:  var l = new SOAPParameter parseInt   f.elements["lower"].value , "lower" ;  var u = new SOAPParameter parseInt   f.elements["upper"].value , “upper” ;  var soapenc = new SOAPEncoding  ;   202  CHAPTER 10 Web Services  assenc = soapenc.getAssociatedEncoding   “http:  schemas.xmlsoap.org soap encoding ”, false   ; var schemacoll = assenc.schemaCollection; var schematype = schemacoll.getType   “integer", "http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"   ; l.schemaType = schematype; u.schemaType = schematype; var parameters = [l, u];  Calling a Web Service with Distinctive Data Types from Mozilla  webservice-mozilla-php.html; excerpt   TIP: First, see whether the Web Service works without this extra encoding. Older Mozilla versions do not support the getAssociatedEncoding   method, whereas some newer versions manage to cooperate with certain .NET Web Services without the extra step of providing the data type.   11 AJAX  and Related Topics   AJAX has generated a huge buzz since the term was  coined in February 2005. And although there is a lot of  justified  criticism, regarding both the term and the technology mix it is promising, the whole hype around AJAX led to the rebirth of JavaScript. Not only are underestimated capabilities of JavaScript carried into the daily work of web developers, but more advanced JavaScript features also are en vogue again.This chapter presents not only the most important facts  and phrases  regarding JavaScript, but also related technolo- gies, especially XML handling with JavaScript.  Understanding AJAX  Back in the 1990s, Microsoft added a new ActiveX object to its Internet Explorer web browser  version 5.0 : XMLHttpRequest.This object was capable of send- ing HTTP requests to a server and evaluating the data returned from that, quite similar to the Web Services   204  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   concept  but using another approach called REST— Representation State Transfer .This came by the request of the Outlook team that worked on the latest version of the web front-end for their software. A few years later, this object was discovered by devel- opers of the Mozilla project, and they decided to cre- ate their own version of XMLHttpRequest—of course, as a native JavaScript object, since ActiveX does not work cross-platform. Also, the Safari developers implemented XMLHttpRequest. Since the browser was based on the KHTML rendering engine of Konqueror, the code  donated by Apple  could also be applied to the KDE browser. Finally, the Opera and iCab browsers also added support for XMLHttpRequest. While more and more web applications were using XMLHttpRequest, Jesse James Garrett wrote an article in February 2005 called “Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications”  available online at http:  www. adaptivepath.com publications essays archives 000385. php . In this article, he coined the term “AJAX,” which stands for “Asynchronous JavaScript + XML.” He argued that his company was using XMLHttpRequest and JavaScript and DOM and XML and XSLT and XHTML and CSS, and it was getting more and more difficult to explain this to clients, especially if they were not technical people.Therefore, the term was invented, although this led to quite some criticism  for instance, no XML is required for AJAX . But still the coining of the term “AJAX” was the tipping point for the technology; from then on, it really took off. From a technical point of view, AJAX is really all about using XMLHttpRequest to send HTTP requests to the web server  which must be in the same domain as   Initializing an AJAX Application  205  the script, for security reasons  and using JavaScript to evaluate and display the data on the client.There is nothing more to it, but still there are even dedicated conferences for AJAX.  Initializing an AJAX Application  XMLHttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ; XMLHttp = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;  The basis of all AJAX applications is the aforemen- tioned XMLHttpRequest object. All AJAX-enabled browsers support it natively, but in Internet Explorer the ActiveX object is required.There is one exception, though: Internet Explorer 7 comes with native XMLHttpRequest support.The best approach to create the object is to use try…catch and to instantiate the native object first  to get Internet Explorer 7 on the right track even though this browser still supports ActiveX , and then the ActiveX version:  if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {     instantiate native object  } else if  window.ActiveXObject  {     instantiate ActiveX object  }  Regarding the ActiveX object, there are several oppor- tunities to instantiate it.The reason: Microsoft ships various versions of their XML library where this object is hidden. A bulletproof solution would be to check for all versions, using a convoluted piece of code. However, the following approach checks only the most important versions and works on Internet   206  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Explorer 5 onward and on all other AJAX-aware browsers:  XMLHttp = new ActiveXObject "Msxml2.XMLHTTP" ;  function getXMLHttp   {  var XMLHttp = null; if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {  XMLHttp = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  } catch  e  { }  } else if  window.ActiveXObject  {  try {  try {  } catch  e  {  try {  XMLHttp = new ActiveXObject   "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;  } catch  e  { }  }  } return XMLHttp;  }  Creating the XMLHttpRequest Object  xmlhttp.js   Sending a GET Request  XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.txt" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  Sending an HTTP request to a server using XMLHttpRequest consists of the following steps: 1. Provide the URL and the HTTP verb to use. 2. Define a callback function when results arrive. 3. Send the request.   Sending a GET Request  207  Step 1 can be taken with the open   method of the XMLHttpRequest object.This does not—unlike what the method name suggests—actually open an HTTP con- nection, but just initializes the object.You provide the HTTP verb to use  usually GET or POST  and the URL. Step 2, the callback function, is provided to the onreadystatechange property of the object.Whenever the readyState property of XMLHttpRequest changes, this callback function is called. Finally, the send   method sends the HTTP request. In the callback function, the readyState value 4 repre- sents the state of the object we want: call completed. In that case, the responseText property contains the data returned from the server. Here is a fully working example, sending a GET request to the server  a file called phrasebook.txt with simple text content  and evaluating the response of that call:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.txt" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  window.alert "Returned data: " +   XMLHttp.responseText ;  }  }    Sending a GET Request  xmlhttpget.html    208  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Understating the States of XMLHttpRequest  All in all, the XMLHttpRequest object supports five states, as shown in Table 11.1. Depending on the implemen- tation, up to all of these states happen during the exe- cution of an AJAX script.That is the reason it is so important to always query the state before trying to access other XMLHttpRequest data.  States of the XMLHttpRequest Object  Table 11.1 State  0  1  2  3  4  Description Uninitialized Loading Loaded Waiting Complete  Sending a POST Request  XMLHttp.setRequestHeader "Content-type",  "application x-www-form-urlencoded" ;  XMLHttp.send "word1=JavaScript&word2=Phrasebook" ;  When a GET request is being sent, all parameters are part of the URL. For POST, however, this data is sent in the body of the HTTP request.To do that with the XMLHttpRequest object, the parameters must be provided in the send   method.There is one caveat, though: If you want to access these parameters on the server side, the correct Content-type HTTP header must be set. This is done by using the setRequestHeader   method in the following fashion:   Sending a POST Request  209  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "POST", "post.php" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.setRequestHeader "Content-type",  "application x-www-form-urlencoded" ;  XMLHttp.send "word1=JavaScript&word2=Phrasebook" ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  window.alert "Returned data: " +   XMLHttp.responseText ;  }  }    Sending a POST Request  xmlhttppost.html   The script posts to the URL post.php, which is a simple PHP script just returning the data:  if  isset $_POST['word1']  &&   isset $_POST['word2']   {  echo $_POST['word1’] . ' ' . $_POST['word2'];  } else {  echo 'No data sent.';  <?php  }  ?>  The Target PHP Script of the POST Request  post.php    210  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Of course, you can provide any other script in any other server-side technology—or you just POST to a plain text file.  Sending a Synchronous Request  XMLHttp.open “GET”, "phrasebook.txt", false ;  By default, HTTP requests via XMLHttpRequest are asynchronous, which explains the need for a callback function. However, when you set the third parameter of the open   method to false, the request is a syn- chronous one, which means that the script execution is stopped until data comes back from the server.The following code makes use of that:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  window.onload = function   {  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.txt", false ; XMLHttp.send null ; document.getElementById "output" .innerHTML =   "Returned data: " + XMLHttp.responseText;  }    Calling the server ...   Sending a Synchronous Request  xmlhttpsync.html    Receiving Multiple Data from the Server  211  Note that the whole code is executed only after the full page has been loaded; otherwise, the access to the output HTML element may fail.  WARNING: Synchronous calls may be convenient, but from a usability and performance point of view, they should be avoided. The script execution stops completely while the call is made, which could turn into a real night- mare with slow connections or servers under a heavy load.  Receiving Multiple Data from the Server  var data = XMLHttp.responseText.split "\n" ;  By default, the responseText property exists only once, so the whole data returned from the server will be put into the string. However, often it is required that more than one piece of data is returned from the XMLHttpRequest call.There are several solutions for this scenario, but probably the easiest one is to return mul- tiple data and separate the individual data using a sepa- ration character that does not occur in the data itself  for instance, a tabulator or a new line or the pipe symbol .Then it is possible to use JavaScript to access this information. For this phrase, the following server-side text file is queried using HTTP.  In a real-world scenario, there would certainly be a dynamic script on the server side, but for demonstration purposes, the static file is just good enough.    212  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   JavaScript Phrasebook Sams Publishing  Multiple Data in One File  phrasebook-multiple.txt   Then, the following code accesses the individual infor- mation in the returned data; Figure 11.1 shows the result.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook-multiple.txt" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  var data = XMLHttp.responseText.split "\n" ; window.alert data[0] + " " + data[1] +   " by " + data[2] ;  }  }    Working with Multiple Data from the Server  xmlhttpmultiple.html    Aborting an HTTP Request  213  Figure 11.1 The server sends multiple data.  Aborting an HTTP Request  XMLHttp.abort  ;  Depending on the browser, only a limited number of HTTP requests can be done at a time. Especially if you have a page with multiple AJAX components  the modern term for this is “mashup” , you may run into trouble.Therefore, aborting an HTTP request may become a necessity. The method used for that is abort  .The following code aborts the request if it has not been fully exe- cuted after five seconds.To demonstrate this behavior, the PHP script delay.php that is called by the code takes 10 seconds to execute. Also note that the readyState property is checked first: if it is 0 or 4, there is nothing to abort.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ;   214  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   XMLHttp.open "GET", "delay.php?" + Math.random   ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ; window.setTimeout "timeout  ;", 5000 ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  window.alert "Returned data: " +   XMLHttp.responseText ;  }  }  function timeout   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState != 4 &&   XMLHttp.readyState != 0  {  XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = function   { }; XMLHttp.abort  ; window.alert "Request aborted" ;  }  }    Aborting an HTTP Request  xmlhttpabort.html   Five seconds after loading this page, the request is aborted.  TIP: Appending the result of Math.random   to the URL to call causes caching for the script delay.php to be disabled, since the URL is a different one every time.   Retrieving HTTP Headers  215  Retrieving HTTP Headers  var headers = XMLHttp.getAllResponseHeaders  ;  The method getAllResponseHeaders    see preceding code  returns all HTTP headers in the HTTP response, whereas the getResponseHeader   method returns just one specific header.The following code shows how to get information about the type of web server used:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.txt" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  var servertype =   XMLHttp.getResponseHeader "Server" ;  window.alert "Web server used: " + servertype ;  }  }    Retrieving an HTTP Response Header  responseheader.html   Note that not all servers send this header; some also put fake data in it to make server profiling harder.   216  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Receiving XML from the Server  var xml = XMLHttp.responseXML;  The responseText property works well for a limited amount of unstructured data. However, a more elegant approach for using complex, structured data within an AJAX application promises to be the responseXML property.When accessing this property, you get the response of the HTTP request as a JavaScript XML DOM object—of course, only if the server returns valid XML; otherwise, you get null. Accessing the details of the XML object is quite simi- lar to accessing DOM elements from JavaScript. For this phrase, the following sample XML file will be used:         JavaScript Phrasebook   Sams Publishing        Sample XML Data  phrasebook.xml   For the web browsers to read in this XML  Internet Explorer especially is very strict in that regard , the correct MIME type must be sent to the client: text xml. If you are using Apache, the following con- figuration in mime.types should do the trick, but is already there by default:  text xml   Receiving XML from the Server  217  On Internet Information Services, you can configure the MIME types in the administration console  Start, Run, inetmgr . Alternatively, let a server-side script serve the file with the correct MIME type; generally this is a must if you are using server-side technology to generate the XML:  <?php  ?>  header 'Content-type: text xml' ; readfile ‘phrasebook.xml’ ;  Setting the Correct Response MIME Type  phrasebook.xml.php   Then, the following code accesses the information in the XML file, using the DOM structure and methods like getElementsByTagName   and getAttribute  . Figure 11.2 shows the result.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.xml" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  var xml = XMLHttp.responseXML; var book = xml.getElementsByTagName "book" [0]; var pubdate = book.getAttribute "pubdate" ; var title, publisher; for  var i=0; i<book.childNodes.length; i++  {   218  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   if  book.childNodes[i].nodeName == "title"  {  title = book.childNodes[i].firstChild  } else if  book.childNodes[i].nodeName ==   publisher = book.childNodes[i].firstChild   cid:1 .nodeValue;   cid:1 "publisher"  {   cid:1 .nodeValue;  }  } window.alert title + " by " + publisher +   "  " + pubdate + " " ;  }  }    Extracting Information from the HTTP Response  xmlhttpxml.html   Figure 11.2 The data from the XML file.  TIP: Another useful property of the XML DOM document is documentElement, which is a shortcut to the root ele- ment of the XML data. So if the root node contains attrib- utes you are interested in  as some Web Services do , documentElement comes in handy.   Receiving XML from the Server  219  Understanding JSON  JSON is, just like AJAX, rather a term than a technol- ogy. However, unlike AJAX, JSON also has its own homepage, http:  www.json.org . JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a longtime neglected and underestimated feature of JavaScript—a quite compact notation for arrays and objects. A lot of books define JavaScript arrays in the following way, for instance:  var ajax = new Array   "Asynchronous", "JavaScript", "+", "XML" ;  However, there is a more compact way, using square brackets:  var ajax = [  "Asynchronous", "JavaScript", "+", "XML"];  The same thing goes for objects  which are more or less elevated arrays in JavaScript , this time using curly braces.The following code defines an object with three properties:  var book = {  "title”: "JavaScript Phrasebook", "publisher": "Sams Publishing", "pubdate": 2006  };  Both “shortcuts” can be combined together to repre- sent complex data as a string. And that is what JSON is all about: Since it can be quite nicely expressed in a string, it is a great data serialization format. It is rather trivial to create a JSON representation of an object on the server side, and it is even simpler to convert this string to a JavaScript object on the client side, as the next phrase shows.   220  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Using JSON for Data  De Serialization  var json = XMLHttp.responseText; var book = eval " " + json + " " ;;  JSON is becoming more and more the de facto stan- dard data exchange format for AJAX applications. Many AJAX frameworks support JSON, many Web Services provide a JSON interface, and PHP 6 will most probably feature JSON support at the core of the language. Using JSON within JavaScript is quite simple, as well. The preceding code evaluates JSON and converts it into a JavaScript object—a simple eval   function call does the trick. The JSON notation from the previous sidebar, “Understanding JSON,” is stored in a file called phrasebook.json; then, the following code reads in this file using XMLHttpRequest and then outputs some data from it:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebook.json" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ;  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  var json = XMLHttp.responseText;   Creating a Waiting Screen  221  var book = eval " " + json + " " ; var pubdate = book.pubdate; var title = book.title; var publisher = book.publisher; window.alert title + " by " + publisher +   "  " + pubdate + " " ;  }  }    Using JSON for Data Deserialization  xmlhttpjson.html   WARNING: Using eval   is general ly a bad idea, since you introduce a serious security vulnerability if the JSON comes from a nontrustworthy source. Due to the same- domain restriction of XMLHttpRequest, the JSON code can usually be trusted, but if you want to feel safer, download the JSON library json.js from http:  www.json.org js. html. Then, the following code replaces the eval   call: var book = json.parseJSON  ;  Creating a Waiting Screen  document.getElementById "loading" .style.visibility  cid:1 = "hidden";  One of the largest obstacles for modern web applica- tions is latency: Something happens, but in the back- ground.You do have to inform the users; otherwise, they will not notice that something is coming up. One way of doing this is by changing the mouse cursor  see Chapter 4,“CSS” ; another way is by using a waiting banner. Many applications let a banner labeled with   222  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   “waiting” or “loading” fade in when an XMLHttpRequest call is executed; one of the first websites to use this was Google Mail. Actually, this phrase requires more DHTML than AJAX.When the  asynchronous!  call is sent to the server, the loading screen is shown and positioned in the upper-right corner  you can, of course, use any arbitrary position of your liking . After data comes back from the server, the banner is made invisible again.The following code implements this in a browser-agnostic fashion:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; window.onload = function   {  XMLHttp.open "GET", "delay.php?" + Math.random   ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction; XMLHttp.send null ; with  document.getElementById "loading"   {  style.visibility = "visible"; if  navigator.appName ==   "Microsoft Internet Explorer"  { style.posLeft =   document.body.clientWidth - 75;  style.posTop = 0;  } else {  style.left =  window.innerWidth - 75  + "px"; style.top = "0px";  }  }  }   Creating a Waiting Screen  223  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  document.getElementById "loading" .style   cid:1 .visibility = "hidden";  window.alert "Returned data: " +   XMLHttp.responseText ;  }  }   <span id="loading" style="position: absolute;   cid:1 visibility: hidden; background-color: red;   cid:1 width: 75px;">Loading ...   Implementing a Waiting Screen  waiting.html   Figure 11.3 shows the browser while waiting for results:The banner appears  and vanishes again after the data from the HTTP request has arrived .  Figure 11.3 The waiting screen.  WARNING: The XMLHttpRequest object will not notice you if anything with your HTTP request goes wrong, which also includes timeouts. So you should use the pattern shown in the phrase “Aborting an HTTP Request” to check the status of the request after a certain period. If the request has not been completed until then, you should restart it—or print out an error message, and let the wait- ing banner disappear.   224  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Solving the Bookmark Problem  var data = unescape location.hash.substring 1  ;  One of the main issues with AJAX applications today is that it is not possible to bookmark a page. Since the contents of a page can change thanks to XMLHttpRequest calls, but the URL stays the same, bookmarking does not work. There is, however, a workaround. Caveat:This workaround is just the shell of the code you have to write; the actual work you have to do  depending on your application  is how to persist data and then apply it back to the page. The trick is to append data that identifies the current state of the page to the URL. Not in the form of a GET parameter  since this would cause a reload of the page , but in the hash:  http:  server file.htmlinfo  The data denoted here with info must identify the current page status.The implementation details largely depend on how AJAX is used on the page. Whenever the current state of the page changes, the page’s hash  location.hash in JavaScript  must be updated.Then, the following code snippet reads in this information after the page is loaded.You have to implement the applyData   function that takes care of transforming the information in location.hash into actual content on the page.  window.onload = function   {  if  location.hash.length >= 2  {  var data = unescape location.hash.substring 1  ;   Solving the Back Button Problem  225  applyData data ;  }  };  This, of course, increases the amount of work to be done, but your users benefit greatly from this conven- ient feature. Unfortunately, this approach does not work  yet  with Safari and Konqueror since they han- dle location.hash in a different way.  WARNING: Do not try to just put JSON into the hash and then call eval  ; otherwise, an attacker could just put malicious JavaScript code in the URL that is then run in the context of your site. This kind of attack is called Cross-Site Scripting  XSS  and is very dangerous. Therefore, always validate data before using it.  Solving the Back Button Problem  window.frames["loader"].window.location.search =   "?" + escape data ;  A problem related to the issue tackled in the previous phrase is the back button  and, of course, the forward button as well .When the page’s URL does not change but its contents do, the back button does not really work as expected. To solve this problem—and again this phrase can show only a generic approach, not a full solution, since there are so many implementation-dependent details—two subproblems have to be worked on:   226  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   n First, you have to make sure that upon loading of a page, the information in location.hash is applied to the page  if you use the previous phrase, this work has already been done .  n Second, you have to make sure that the various  pages with the new hash are in the browser’s his- tory; otherwise, the back and forward buttons will not work.This is done automatically with Mozilla browsers, but not with Internet Explorer.  The solution to the second subproblem is to use a hid- den iframe that will load an invisible page, just to get an entry in the history of the page. Here is the iframe:  <iframe src="loader.html" name="loader"   style="display:none">   Whenever something happens on the page  AJAX- wise , the loader frame must be forced to load again, with data appended to the URL  unlike the previous code, this time there must be a reload : if  window.ActiveXObject  {  window.frames["loader"].window.location.search =   "?" + escape data ;  }  Finally, the loader frame must take care of applying any loaded data to the main document; at least for Internet Explorer this is required, since in this browser the back and forward buttons change the contents of the iframe!  window.onload = function   {  if  location.search.length >= 2  {  var data = unescape   location.search.substring 1  ;  top.applyData data ;  }  };   Solving the Back Button Problem  227  This makes the coder’s life much more complicated, especially if there are many different AJAX effects on the page. But just to repeat one of the final sentences from the previous phrase:Your users benefit greatly from this convenient feature. And again, this work- around does not work with Safari and Konqueror  yet .  Understanding XSLT  In 1999, the W3C published the XSLT 1.0 specifica- tion.The acronym stands for Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations.This is a language based on XML to transform data into another form. Most of the time, the output data is HTML, but other formats are also possible. On the Web, however, usually HTML is the way to go. XSLT works with templates; within these templates you can, among other things, access node values and also attribute values in the XML source file.The fol- lowing code shows a sample XSLT file:    <xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"   xmlns:xsl="http:  www.w3.org 1999 XSL Transform">               by               228  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics          The XSLT File  phrasebooks.xsl   Using XSLT  var process = new XSLTProcessor  ;  Both Internet Explorer and Mozilla browsers do sup- port XSLT from JavaScript. However, the approach is very different. For Microsoft Internet Explorer, once again ActiveX is required  also with Internet Explorer 7 .You first load the XSLT file, then the XML  com- ing from XMLHttpRequest, of course . Finally, the result of the XSL transformation is available as a string and can, for instance, be appended to the page. Mozilla browsers, on the other hand, use a different approach; they rely exclusively on native object.The result, however, is different from the Internet Explorer implementation. At the end, you get a DOM fragment, which you can append to the current page’s DOM. The following code covers both major browser types:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="xmlhttp.js">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var XMLHttp = getXMLHttp  ; window.onload = function   {  XMLHttp.open "GET", "phrasebooks.xml" ; XMLHttp.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction;   Using XSLT  229  XMLHttp.send null ;  }  function handlerFunction   {  if  XMLHttp.readyState == 4  {  var xml = XMLHttp.responseXML; if  window.ActiveXObject  {  var xslt = new ActiveXObject   "MSXML2.FreeThreadedDOMDocument" ;  xslt.async = false; xslt.load "phrasebooks.xsl" ; var template = new ActiveXObject   "MSXML2.XSLTemplate" ;  template.stylesheet = xslt; var process = template.createProcessor  ; process.input = xml; process.transform  ; var para = document.createElement "p" ; para.innerHTML = process.output; document.body.appendChild para ; } else if  window.XSLTProcessor  {  var xslt = document.implementation   cid:1 .createDocument "", "", null ;  xslt.async = false; xslt.load "phrasebooks.xsl" ; var process = new XSLTProcessor  ; process.importStylesheet xslt ; var result = process.transformToFragment   xml, document ;  document.body.appendChild result ;  }  }  }    Using XSLT with JavaScript  xmlhttpxsl.html    230  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   Figure 11.4 shows the output of the transformation: The data in the XML file is presented as a bulleted list.  Figure 11.4 The outcome of the XSL transformation.  As Figure 11.4 also demonstrates, the Opera browser  from version 9 onward  has a compatible XSLT implementation, using the Mozilla approach.  Using an XML Library  var result = xsltProcess xml, xslt ;  As you can see, using XSLT from JavaScript can be quite tricky if it is to work on as many browsers as possible. In this case, using an external framework can really save a lot of time and effort. Google has created such a framework  “AJAXSLT”  which is available free  under a BSD license  at http:  goog-ajaxslt.sourceforge.net .The following phrase uses version 0.4 of the framework, which you can also see from the paths used in the code.The framework itself is also not part of the source code downloads for this book.   Using an XML Library  231  The following phrase does the XSLT transformation, but this time relies on the functionality offered by AJAXSLT.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src=”xmlhttp.js">   <script src="ajaxslt-0.4 misc.js"  type="text javascript">   <script src="ajaxslt-0.4 dom.js"   type="text javascript">   <script src="ajaxslt-0.4 xpath.js"   type="text javascript">  <script src="ajaxslt-0.4 xslt.js"  type="text javascript">   <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  var xml = null; var xslt = null; var XMLHttp1 = getXMLHttp  ; var XMLHttp2 = getXMLHttp  ; window.onload = function   {  XMLHttp1.open "GET", "phrasebooks.xml" ; XMLHttp1.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction1; XMLHttp1.send null ; XMLHttp2.open "GET", "phrasebooks.xsl" ; XMLHttp2.onreadystatechange = handlerFunction2; XMLHttp2.send null ;  }  function handlerFunction1   {  if  XMLHttp1.readyState == 4  {  xml = xmlParse XMLHttp1.responseText ; if  xslt != null  {  transform  ;  }   232  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   }  }  }  }  }  function handlerFunction2   {  if  XMLHttp2.readyState == 4  {  xslt = xmlParse XMLHttp2.responseText ; if  xml != null  {  transform  ;  function transform   {  var result = xsltProcess xml, xslt ; document.getElementById "output" .innerHTML =   result;  }       Using XSLT with JavaScript and AJAXSLT  ajaxslt.html   This not only works fine  as you can see, most of the code is “spent” for loading the XML and XSL files , but also works cross-browser, as Figure 11.5  shot in Konqueror  demonstrates. Another nice feature:You can also use XPath with this library. Both Internet Explorer and Mozilla browsers and Opera work with XPath, but in an even more incompatible way than they do regarding XSLT. Also, the AJAXSLT XPath support can deal with other browsers, as well.   Using the Yahoo! Web Service  233  Figure 11.5 With AJAXLST the transformation  even works in Konqueror.  Using the Yahoo! Web Service  <script language="JavaScript" type="text javascript" src="http:  api.search.yahoo.com WebSearchService   V1 webSearch?appid=XXXXX&query=JavaScript&output= json&callback=showResults”>    More and more Web Services provide a JSON inter- face, and among the first ones to do so were the Yahoo! Web Services. After a  free  registration at http:  api.search.yahoo.com webservices register_ application, you get your personal application ID.This ID is tied to your application and must be used instead of the XXXXX placeholder in this phrase.Then, the pre- ceding   tag not only calls the Web Service and expects JSON back, but also provides the name of a callback function that is called after the data is there. So your application receives JavaScript code from the Yahoo! server and executes it—which means you have to trust Yahoo! in order to use it.Then, the callback function gets a JavaScript object with the Yahoo! search results.   234  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   The following code then creates a bulleted list with the data from the Web Service. More information about the specific format of the data returned from Yahoo! can be found at the online documentation at http:  developer.yahoo.com search web V1  webSearch.html. Figure 11.6 shows the output of this code.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function showResults data  {  var ul = document.getElementById "output" ; for  var i=0; i < data.ResultSet.Result.length;    cid:1 i++  {  var text = document.createTextNode   data.ResultSet.Result[i].Title + " - " +  data.ResultSet.Result[i].Url ;  var li = document.createElement "li" ; li.appendChild text ; ul.appendChild li ;  }  }              <script language="JavaScript" type="text javascript" src="http:  api.search.yahoo.com WebSearchService    cid:1 V1 webSearch?appid=XXXXX&query=JavaScript&  cid:1 output=json&callback=showResults">    Calling the Yahoo! Web Service with JavaScript  yahoowebservice.html    Using the Yahoo! Web Service  235  Figure 11.6 The Yahoo! search results.  Using an AJAX Framework  The more AJAX you are using on your website, the more you should look into available AJAX frameworks that can facilitate working with XMLHttpRequest and other advanced JavaScript features. Which framework to choose depends largely on the server-side technology that is used.There are several AJAX frameworks for both Java  for example, Zimbra, at http:  www.zimbra.com   and ASP.NET 2.0  for example, Atlas, at http:  atlas.asp.net  ; PHP knows too many frameworks to mention  including the PEAR package at http:  pear.php.net package  HTML_AJAX . Quite interesting are also technology-independent AJAX frameworks that rather focus on the JavaScript side of things. Dojo, especially  http:  www.dojo- toolkit.org  , is worth mentioning, since it offers   236  CHAPTER 11 AJAX  and Related Topics   workarounds similar to those mentioned in this chap- ter to make the back and forward buttons work again. One of the oldest frameworks, by the way, is consid- ered to be Tibet  http:  www.technicalpursuit.com  , which started being worked on  at least conceptually  in 1997 and saw its first release in 1999. So choose your framework wisely depending on the server-side technology—are you exclusively using one server technology, or are you more customer driven? Depending on this information, the features of the var- ious frameworks, and especially the development activ- ity  since many projects never really get off the ground or stall after some months , you pick a framework; but quite often the phrases in this chapter will give you all you need to turn your web application into an AJAX application.   12 Embedded Media  HTML and JavaScript are a killer combination, but  sometimes more is required to create a modern web application.Therefore, HTML enables web developers to integrate other content in a site; generally, you need a browser plug-in for that.This chapter shows how to access this content and gives a few pointers for the most widely used content types. Note that most phrases in this chapter do not come with code downloads.  Accessing Embedded Media  document.media  The “official” HTML element to embed media is  . However, to have a cross-browser site, usually an   object is embedded within the   element.To make accessing the embedded object as easy as possible, the   element’s id attribute should match the   object’s name attribute:             238  CHAPTER 12  Embedded Media  Then, you can access the embedded media using the shortcut from the beginning of this phrase. Of course, you could also use document.getElementById   to access the   element; all   elements reside in the document.embeds array. As you can see, the shortcut is much more convenient here.  Checking for Plug-Ins  if  new ActiveXObject   "ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.8"   { }  In Mozilla browsers, the about:plugins special URL provides a list of all available plug-ins, as Figure 12.1 shows; this works in Opera as well.  Figure 12.1 Opera shows a list of all installed plugins.  Depending on the chosen browser, there are two ways to actively check for the presence of a certain plug-in:   Checking for Plug-Ins  239  n On Mozilla browsers and Opera  which uses the same API , navigator.plugins is an array with all plug-ins. Every array element exposes the name, filename, and description of every plug-in. Also, navigator.mimeTypes contains a list of all supported MIME types the plug-in can support.  n On Internet Explorer  Windows only , you can try to instantiate the associated class the plug-in exposes, by using the ActiveXObject constructor.  The following code tries to detect the Flash plug-in. For Internet Explorer, the name of the associated COM object is used; for other browsers, the code is looking for a plug-in called “Shockwave Flash.”  <script language="JavaScript" type="text javascript"> var hasFlash = false; if  window.ActiveXObject  {  try {  if  new ActiveXObject   "ShockwaveFlash.ShockwaveFlash.8"   { hasFlash = true;  }  } catch  e  { }  } else if  navigator.plugins  {  if  navigator.plugins["Shockwave Flash"]  {  hasFlash = true;  }  } window.alert hasFlash ;    Detecting the Flash Plug-In  plugin.html    240  CHAPTER 12  Embedded Media  WARNING: The array navigator.plugins is also available on Internet Explorer, but empty. Therefore, you have to first check for window.ActiveXObject, then for navigator.plugins. It will not work the other way around.  Coping with Recent Internet Explorer Versions A court ruling forced Microsoft to release an update for its browser in March and April 2006 that changed the behavior of embedded media.Without the user “activating” the embedded data by clicking on it, many events are not fired and other restrictions apply. Figure 12.2 shows the information the browser provides in that case.  Figure 12.2 The embedded media   here: a Flash movie  is inactive.  However, on http:  msdn.microsoft.com workshop  author dhtml overview activating_activex.asp,   Accessing Multimedia Content  241  Microsoft explains a workaround.The idea is to use JavaScript to include the   element on the page.Yet due to the technical details of the ruling, the JavaScript code that creates  via the document.write   method  the   element must reside in an exter- nal file. So what you want to do is to first use a   element in the following fashion:  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript" src="externalFile.js">     Then, in the externalFile.js file, you output the markup that loads the embedded media file:  document.write "<object classid=\"...\" ...> " ;  TIP: Of course, the embedded media then works only when JavaScript is activated, so you should also have a solution in an   element. Due to the software patent that caused the court ruling, it is also possible that other browser vendors may have to implement a similar new behavior for embedded media.  Accessing Multimedia Content Accessing multimedia content  audio or video data  in the browser is quite difficult.There are a lot of plug-ins, and every version seems to change something in respect to its predecessor. So for up-to-date or version-specific information regarding accessing the various plug-ins, the vendor’s website is the best choice. However, there’s some good news as well.The major plug-ins for multimedia data, currently Windows   242  CHAPTER 12  Embedded Media  Media Player, Real Player, and Apple QuickTime, are quite similar with regard to method names. So after you’ve accessed the plug-in as described at the begin- ning of this chapter, the methods from Table 12.1 pro- vide you with the essential functionality you need for working with the embedded media.  Table 12.1 Methods for Multimedia Functionality  Windows Media Player Real Player  Action Play Stop Pause Volume  play    stop    pause    volume  DoPlay    DoStop    QuickTime  play    stop    DoPause    pause    GetVolume    SetVolume    GetVolume    SetVolume    Accessing Java Content  document.JavaApplet.setString field.value ;  Java was once thought to be the dominant web for- mat, but nowadays it works more in the background than in the front-end. However, you still see some Java applets embedded in web pages from time to time, although the Java plug-in lacks the large penetration of the Flash plug-in. When a Java applet is embedded in a page, you can call all public methods of this applet.The following, very simple applet exposes its setString   method, which sets a private variable and then repaints the applet:   Accessing Java Content  243  import java.applet.*; import java.awt.*;  public class JavaApplet extends Applet {  private String _s = "Welcome!";  public void paint Graphics g  {  g.setColor Color.black ; g.drawString _s, 20, 20 ;  public void setString String s  {  this._s = s; this.repaint  ;  }  }  }  A Simple Java Applet  JavaApplet.java   After this applet is compiled into a class, the following JavaScript code calls the setString   method whenever the content of the text field changes. Figure 12.3 shows the result.  <script language="JavaScript"   type="text javascript">  function paint field  {  document.JavaApplet.setString field.value ;  }   <applet code="JavaApplet.class" name="JavaApplet"  width="150" height="75">       Accessing Java with JavaScript  java.html    244  CHAPTER 12  Embedded Media  Figure 12.3 The applet changes while  you are typing.  Accessing Flash Content  document.flash.Play  ; document.flash.Rewind  ; document.flash.StopPlay  ;  Flash movies can also be controlled via JavaScript. Among other things, you can start, stop, and pause the movie. For these purposes, the plug-in exposes the Play  , Rewind  , and StopPlay   methods.The follow- ing listing implements a simple control station for the Flash movie:  <object  444553540000"  classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-  codebase="http:  fpdownload.macromedia.com pub    cid:1 shockwave cabs flash swflash.cab  cid:1 version=7,0,0,0"  width="400" height="550" id="flash"> <param name="allowScriptAccess"   value="sameDomain"  >   Accessing Flash Content  245    <embed src="flash.swf" width="400" height="550"   name="flash" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http:  www.macromedia.com go    cid:1 getflashplayer"  >             Play   Stop   Pause   Accessing a Flash Movie from JavaScript  flash.html   NOTE: The allowScriptAccess options set in both the   and the   elements allow JavaScript to actually access the Flash movie.

Developers are hungry for a concise, easy-to-use reference that puts essential code "phrases" at their fingertips. JavaScript, and the related AJAX, is hot and there is little to no information on how to use JavaScript to develop AJAX-based applications. While there are many JavaScript books on the market, most of them are dated and few cover the most recent developments, such as AJAX.JavaScript Phrasebookis the guide to JavaScript and AJAX that you can and will take with you everywhere. Skipping the usual tutorial on JavaScript and introducing AJAX as one of the first published works on the topic, theJavaScript Phrasebookgoes straight to practical JavaScript and AJAX tools, providing immediately applicable solutions for frequent tasks and code so flexible that it is easily adapted to the your individual needs
