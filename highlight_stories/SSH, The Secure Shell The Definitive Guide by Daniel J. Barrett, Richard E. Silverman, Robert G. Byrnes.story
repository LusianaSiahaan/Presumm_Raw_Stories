Here’s a sampling of what’s new in this edition:    Over 100 new features, options, and configuration keywords from the latest ver- sions of OpenSSH and SSH Tectia  formerly known as SSH Secure Shell or SSH2 from ssh.com     Expanded material on the SSH-2 protocol and its internals, including a step-by-  step tour through the transport, authentication, and connection phases    Running OpenSSH on Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OS X   All-new chapters on Windows software such as Tectia, SecureCRT, and PuTTY   Scalable authentication techniques for large installations, including X.509 certifi-  cates    Single sign-on between Linux and Windows via Kerberos GSSAPI   Logging and debugging in greater depth   Tectia’s metaconfiguration, subconfiguration, and plugins, with examples  ...and much more! You might be surprised at how much is changed, but in the past four years, SSH has significantly evolved:  SSH-2 protocol triumphant  Back in 2001, only a handful of SSH products supported the relatively new SSH- 2 protocol, and the primary implementation was commercial. Today, the old SSH-1 protocol is dying out and all modern SSH products, free and commercial, use the more secure and flexible SSH-2 protocol. We now recommend that everyone avoid SSH-1.  The rise of OpenSSH  This little upstart from the OpenBSD world has become the dominant imple- mentation of SSH on the Internet, snatching the crown from the original, SSH Secure Shell  now called SSH Tectia, which we abbreviate as Tectia . Tectia is  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  xi   still more powerful than OpenSSH in important ways; but as OpenSSH is now included as standard with Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and beyond, it dominates in pure numbers.  The death of telnet and the r-tools  The insecure programs telnet, rsh, rcp, and rlogin—long the standards for com- munication between computers—are effectively extinct.* FTP is also on the way out, except when operated behind firewalls or over private lines.  An explosion of Windows products  In 2001, there were a handful of SSH implementations for Windows; now there are dozens of GUI clients and several robust servers, not to mention a full port of the free OpenSSH.  Increased attacks  The Internet has experienced a sharp rise in computer intrusions. Now more than ever, your servers and firewalls should be configured to block all remote accesses except via SSH  or other secure protocols .  Protect Your Network with SSH Let’s start with the basics. SSH, the Secure Shell, is a reliable, reasonably easy to use, inexpensive security product for computer networks and the people who use them. It’s available for most of today’s operating systems.  Privacy is a basic human right, but on today’s computer networks, privacy isn’t guaranteed. Much of the data that travels on the Internet or local networks is transmitted as plain text, and may be captured and viewed by anybody with a lit- tle technical know-how. The email you send, the files you transmit between com- puters, even the passwords you type may be readable by others. Imagine the damage that can be done if an untrusted third party—a competitor, the CIA, your in-laws— intercepted your most sensitive communications in transit.  SSH is a small, unassuming, yet powerful and robust solution to many of these issues. It keeps prying eyes away from the data on your network. It doesn’t solve every privacy and security problem, but it eliminates several of them effectively. Its major features are:    A secure, client server protocol for encrypting and transmitting data over a net-  work    Authentication  recognition  of users by password, host, or public key, plus optional integration with other popular authentication systems, such as PAM, Kerberos, SecurID, and PGP  * Not counting secure versions of these tools, e.g., when enhanced with Kerberos support. [1.6.3]  xii    Preface  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     The ability to add security to insecure network applications such as Telnet,  NNTP, VNC, and many other TCP IP-based programs and protocols    Almost complete transparency to the end user   Implementations for most operating systems  Intended Audience We’ve written this book for system administrators and technically minded users. Some chapters are suitable for a wide audience, while others are thoroughly techni- cal and intended for computer and networking professionals.  End-User Audience Do you have two or more computer accounts on different machines? SSH lets you connect one to another with a high degree of security. You can remotely log into one account from the other, execute remote commands, and copy files between accounts, all with the confidence that nobody can intercept your username, pass- word, or data in transit.  Do you connect from a personal computer to an Internet service provider  ISP ? In particular, do you connect to a Unix shell account at your ISP? If so, SSH can make this connection significantly more secure. An increasing number of ISPs are running SSH servers for their users. In case your ISP doesn’t, we’ll show you how to run a server yourself.  Do you develop software? Are you creating distributed applications that must com- municate over a network securely? Then don’t reinvent the wheel: use SSH to encrypt the connections. It’s a solid technology that may reduce your development time.  Even if you have only a single computer account, as long as it’s connected to a net- work, SSH can still be useful. For example, if you’ve ever wanted to let other people use your account, such as family members or employees, but didn’t want to give them unlimited use, SSH can provide a carefully controlled, limited-access channel into your account.  Prerequisites We assume you are familiar with computers and networking as found in any mod- ern business office or home system with an Internet connection. Ideally, you are familiar with network applications like Telnet and FTP. If you are a Unix user, you should be familiar with standard network applications  e.g., ftp  and the basics of writing shell scripts and Perl scripts.

Preface    xiii   System-Administrator Audience If you’re a Unix or Macintosh OS X system administrator, you probably know about SSH already. It’s less well known in the Windows world, where secure log- ins are usually accomplished with radmin  Remote Administrator  and other remote desktop applications, and network file transfers are done using network shares. In contrast, SSH is more focused on the command line and is therefore more scriptable than the usual Windows techniques. SSH also can increase the security of other TCP IP-based applications on your network by transparently “tunneling” them through SSH-encrypted connections. You will love SSH.  Prerequisites In addition to the end-user prerequisites in the previous section, you should be famil- iar with user accounts and groups, networking concepts such as TCP IP and pack- ets, and basic encryption techniques.  Reading This Book This book is divided roughly into three parts. The first three chapters are a general introduction to SSH, first at a high level for all readers  Chapters 1 and 2 , and then in detail for technical readers  Chapter 3 .  The next nine chapters cover SSH for Unix and similar operating systems  OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, etc. . The first two  Chapters 4 and 5  cover SSH installation and serv- erwide configuration for system administrators. The next four  Chapters 6–9  cover advanced topics for end users, including key management, client configuration, per- account server configuration, and forwarding. We complete the Unix sequence with our recommended setup  Chapter 10 , some detailed case studies  Chapter 11 , and troubleshooting tips  Chapter 12 . The remaining chapters cover SSH products for Windows and the Macintosh, plus brief overviews of implementations for other platforms.  Each section in the book is numbered, and we provide cross-references throughout the text. If further details are found in Section 7.1.2.2, we use the notation [7.1.2.2] to indicate it.  Our Approach This book is organized by concept rather than syntax. We begin with an overview and progressively lead you deeper into the functionality of SSH. So, we might intro- duce a topic in Chapter 1, show its basic use in Chapter 2, and reveal advanced uses in Chapter 7. If you prefer the whole story at once, Appendix E presents all com- mands and configuration options in one location.  xiv    Preface  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   We focus strongly on three levels of server configuration, which we call compile- time, serverwide, and per-account configuration. Compile-time configuration  Chapter 4  means selecting appropriate options when you build the SSH clients and servers. Serverwide configuration  Chapter 5  applies when the SSH server is run and is generally done by system administrators, while per-account configuration  Chapter 8  can be done anytime by end users. It’s vitally important for system administrators to understand the relationships and differences among these three lev- els. Otherwise, SSH may seem like a morass of random behaviors.  Although the bulk of material focuses on Unix implementations of SSH, you don’t have to be a Unix user to understand it. Fans of Windows and the Macintosh may stick to the later chapters devoted to their platforms, but a lot of the meaty details are in the Unix chapters, so we recommend reading them, at least for reference.  Which Chapters Are for You? We propose several “tracks” for readers with different interests and skills:  System administrators  Chapters 3–5 and 10 are the most important for understanding SSH and how to build and configure servers. However, as the administrator of a security prod- uct, you should read the whole book.  Unix users  not system administrators   Chapters 1 and 2 provide an overview, and Chapters 6–9 discuss SSH clients in depth.  Windows end users  Read Chapters 1, 2, 13, 14, and 16–18 for starters, and then others as your inter- ests guide you. Macintosh end users  Read Chapters 1, 2, 13, and 15 for starters, and then others as your interests guide you.  Users of other computer platforms  Read Chapters 1, 2, and 13 for starters, and then others as your interests guide you.  Even if you are experienced with SSH, you’ll likely find value in Chapters 3–12. We cover significant details the Unix manpages leave unclear or unmentioned, including major concepts, compile-time flags, server configuration, and forwarding.

Preface    xv   Supported Platforms This book covers Unix, Windows, and Macintosh implementations of SSH.  When we say “Unix” in this book, we mean the whole family of Unix- like operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, and Solaris.  SSH products are also available for the Amiga, BeOs, Java, OS 2, Palm Pilot, VMS, and Windows CE, and although we don’t cover them, their principles are the same.  This book is current for the following Unix SSH versions:  OpenSSH SSH Tectia  3.9a 4.2  a See Appendix A for a preview of new features in OpenSSH 4.0.  Version information for non-Unix products is found in their respective chapters.  Disclaimers We identify some program features as “undocumented.” This means the feature isn’t mentioned in the official documentation but works in the current release and or is clear from the program source code. Undocumented features might not be officially supported by the software authors and can disappear in later releases.  Conventions Used in This Book The following typographical conventions are used in this book:  Constant width  For configuration files, things that can be found in configuration files  such as keywords and configuration file options , source code, and interactive terminal sessions.  Constant width italic  For replaceable parameters on command lines or within configuration files.  For filenames, URLs, hostnames, command names, command-line options, and new terms where they are defined.  In figures, the object labeled A has been secured using a cryptographic key labeled K. “Secured” means encrypted, signed, or some more complex relation- ship, depending on the context. If A is secured using multiple keys  say, K and L , they are listed in the subscript, separated by commas: A K, L.

Chapter 1  CHAPTER 1 Introduction to SSH  Many people today have multiple computer accounts. If you’re a reasonably savvy user, you might have a personal account with an Internet service provider  ISP , a work account on your employer’s local network, and a few computers at home. You might also have permission to use other accounts owned by family members or friends.  If you have multiple accounts, it’s natural to want to make connections between them. For instance, you might want to copy files between computers over a network, log into one account remotely from another, or transmit commands to a remote com- puter for execution. Various programs exist for these purposes, such as ftp for file transfers, telnet for remote logins, and rsh for remote execution of commands.  Unfortunately, many of these network-related programs have a fundamental prob- lem: they lack security. If you transmit a sensitive file via the Internet, an intruder can potentially intercept and read the data. Even worse, if you log onto another com- puter remotely using a program such as telnet, your username and password can be intercepted as they travel over the network. Yikes!  How can these serious problems be prevented? You can use an encryption program to scramble your data into a secret code nobody else can read. You can install a fire- wall, a device that shields portions of a computer network from intruders, and keep all your communications behind it. Or you can use a wide range of other solutions, alone or combined, with varying complexity and cost.  1.1 What Is SSH? SSH, the Secure Shell, is a popular, powerful, software-based approach to network security.* Whenever data is sent by a computer to the network, SSH automatically encrypts  scrambles  it. Then, when the data reaches its intended recipient, SSH  * “SSH” is pronounced by spelling it aloud: S-S-H.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1   automatically decrypts  unscrambles  it. The result is transparent encryption: users can work normally, unaware that their communications are safely encrypted on the network. In addition, SSH uses modern, secure encryption algorithms and is effec- tive enough to be found within mission-critical applications at major corporations.  SSH has a client server architecture, as shown in Figure 1-1. An SSH server program, typically installed and run by a system administrator, accepts or rejects incoming connections to its host computer. Users then run SSH client programs, typically on other computers, to make requests of the SSH server, such as “Please log me in,” “Please send me a file,” or “Please execute this command.” All communications between clients and servers are securely encrypted and protected from modification.

SSH architecture  2    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Our description is simplified but should give you a general idea of what SSH does. We’ll go into depth later. For now, just remember that SSH clients communicate with SSH servers over encrypted network connections.  SSH software is very common today. It comes with most Linux distributions, Macin- tosh OS X, Sun Solaris, OpenBSD, and virtually all other Unix-inspired operating systems. Microsoft Windows has plenty of SSH clients and servers, both free and commercial. You can even find it for PalmOS, Commodore Amiga, and most other platforms. [13.3]  Many SSH clients are inspired by old Unix programs called the “r-commands:” rsh  remote shell , rlogin  remote login , and rcp  remote copy . In fact, for many pur- poses the SSH clients are drop-in replacements for the r-commands, so if you’re still using them, switch to SSH immediately! The old r-commands are notoriously inse- cure, and the SSH learning curve is small.  1.2 What SSH Is Not Although SSH stands for Secure Shell, it is not a true shell in the sense of the Unix Bourne shell and C shell. It is not a command interpreter, nor does it provide wild- card expansion, command history, and so forth. Rather, SSH creates a channel for running a shell on a remote computer, with end-to-end encryption between the two systems.  SSH is also not a complete security solution—but then, nothing is. It won’t protect computers from active break-in attempts or denial-of-service attacks, and it won’t eliminate other hazards such as viruses, Trojan horses, and coffee spills. It does, however, provide robust and user-friendly encryption and authentication.  The SSH Protocol  1.3 SSH is a protocol, not a product. It is a specification of how to conduct secure com- munication over a network.*  The SSH protocol covers authentication, encryption, and the integrity of data trans- mitted over a network, as shown in Figure 1-2. Let’s define these terms:  Authentication  Reliably determines someone’s identity. If you try to log into an account on a remote computer, SSH asks for digital proof of your identity. If you pass the test, you may log in; otherwise, SSH rejects the connection.  * Although we say “the SSH protocol,” there are actually two incompatible versions of the protocols in com-  mon use: SSH-1  a.k.a. SSH-1.5  and SSH-2. We distinguish these protocols later.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.3 The SSH Protocol    3   Encryption  Integrity  Scrambles data so that it is unintelligible except to the intended recipients. This protects your data as it passes over the network.  Guarantees the data traveling over the network arrives unaltered. If a third party captures and modifies your data in transit, SSH detects this fact.

Authentication, encryption, and integrity  In short, SSH makes network connections between computers, with strong guarantees that the parties on both ends of the connection are genuine. It also ensures that any data passing over these connections arrives unmodified and unread by eavesdroppers.  Protocols, Products, Clients, and Confusion  1.3.1 The first SSH product, created by Tatu Ylönen for Unix, was simply called “SSH.” This caused confusion because SSH was also the name of the protocol. In this book, we use more precise terminology to refer to protocols, products, and programs, sum- marized in the sidebar “Terminology: SSH Protocols and Products.” In short:    Protocols are denoted with dashes: SSH-1, SSH-2.   Products are denoted in mixed case, without dashes: OpenSSH, Tectia, PuTTY,  etc.    Client programs are in lowercase: ssh, scp, putty, etc.  4    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Overview of SSH Features  1.4 So, what can SSH do? Let’s run through some examples that demonstrate the major features of SSH, such as secure remote logins, secure file copying, and secure invoca- tion of remote commands.  Secure Remote Logins  1.4.1 Suppose you have login accounts on several computers on the Internet. Common programs like telnet let you log into one computer from another, say, from your home PC to your web hosting provider, or from one office computer to another. Unfortunately, telnet and similar programs transmit your username and password in  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.4 Overview of SSH Features    5   plain text over the Internet, where a malicious third party can intercept them.* Addi- tionally, your entire telnet session is readable by a network snooper.  Terminology: Networking  Local computer  local host, local machine   A computer on which you are logged in and, typically, running an SSH client.  Remote computer  remote host, remote machine   A second computer you connect to via your local computer. Typically, the remote computer is running an SSH server and is accessed via an SSH client. As a degen- erate case, the local and remote computers can be the same machine.  Local user  Remote user  Server  A user logged into a local computer.  A user logged into a remote computer.  An SSH server program.  Server machine  A computer running an SSH server program. We sometimes simply write “server” for the server machine when the context makes clear  or irrelevant  the distinction between the running SSH server program and its host machine.  Client  An SSH client program.  Client machine  ~ or $HOME  A computer running an SSH client. As with the server terminology, we simply write “client” when the context makes the meaning clear.  A user’s home directory on a Unix machine, particularly when used in a file path such as ~ filename. Most shells recognize ~ as a user’s home directory, with the notable exception of the Bourne shell. $HOME is recognized by all shells.  SSH completely avoids these problems. Rather than running the insecure telnet pro- gram, you run the SSH client program ssh. To log into an account with the user- name smith on the remote computer host.example.com, use this command:  $ ssh -l smith host.example.com  The client authenticates you to the remote computer’s SSH server using an encrypted connection, meaning that your username and password are encrypted before they leave the local machine. The SSH server then logs you in, and your entire login  * This is true of standard Telnet, but some implementations add security features.  6    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   session is encrypted as it travels between client and server. Because the encryption is transparent, you won’t notice any differences between telnet and the telnet-like SSH client.  Secure File Transfer  1.4.2 Suppose you have accounts on two Internet computers, me@firstaccount.com and metoo@secondaccount.com, and you want to transfer a file from the first to the sec- ond account. The file contains trade secrets about your business, however, that must be kept from prying eyes. A traditional file-transfer program, such as ftp, doesn’t pro- vide a secure solution. A third party can intercept and read the packets as they travel over the network. To get around this problem, you can encrypt the file on firstaccount.com with a program such as Pretty Good Privacy  PGP , transfer it via traditional means, and decrypt the file on secondaccount.com, but such a process is tedious and nontransparent to the user.  Using SSH, the file can be transferred securely between machines with a single secure copy command. the command executed on firstaccount.com might be:  the file were named myfile,  If  $ scp myfile metoo@secondaccount.com:  When transmitted by scp, the file is automatically encrypted as it leaves firstaccount. com and decrypted as it arrives on secondaccount.com.  Secure Remote Command Execution  1.4.3 Suppose you are a system administrator who needs to run the same command on many computers. You’d like to view the active processes for each user on four differ- ent computers—grape, lemon, kiwi, and melon—on a local area network using the Unix command  usr bin w. Many SSH clients can run a single remote command if you provide it at the end of the command line. This short shell script does the trick:  ! bin sh for machine in grape lemon kiwi melon do   ssh $machine  usr bin w done  Execute remote command by ssh  Each w command and its results are encrypted as they travel across the network, and strong authentication techniques may be used when connecting to the remote machines.  Keys and Agents  1.4.4 Suppose you have accounts on many computers on a network. For security reasons, you prefer different passwords on all accounts; but remembering so many pass- words is difficult. It’s also a security problem in itself. The more often you type a  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.4 Overview of SSH Features    7   password, the more likely you’ll mistakenly type it in the wrong place.  Have you ever accidentally typed your password instead of your username, visible to the world? Ouch! And on many systems, such mistakes are recorded in a system log file, revealing your password in plain text.  Wouldn’t it be great to identify yourself only once and get secure access to all the accounts without continually typing passwords?  SSH has various authentication mechanisms, and the most secure is based on keys rather than passwords. Keys are discussed in great detail in Chapter 6, but for now we define a key as a small blob of bits that uniquely identifies an SSH user. For secu- rity, a key is kept encrypted; it may be used only after entering a secret passphrase to decrypt it.  Using keys, together with a program called an authentication agent, SSH can authen- ticate you to all your computer accounts securely without requiring you to memo- rize many passwords or enter them repeatedly. It works like this:  1. In advance  and only once , place special, nonsecure files called public key files into your remote computer accounts. These enable your SSH clients  ssh, scp  to access your remote accounts.  2. On your local machine,  invoke the ssh-agent program, which runs in the  background.  3. Choose the key  or keys  you will need during your login session. 4. Load the keys into the agent with the ssh-add program. This requires knowledge  of each key’s secret passphrase.  At this point, you have an ssh-agent program running on your local machine, hold- ing your secret keys in memory. You’re now done. You have passwordless access to all your remote accounts that contain your public key files. Say goodbye to the tedium of retyping passwords! The setup lasts until you log out from the local machine or terminate ssh-agent.  Access Control  1.4.5 Suppose you want to permit another person to use your computer account, but only for certain purposes. For example, while you’re out of town you’d like your secretary to read your email but not to do anything else in your account. With SSH, you can give your secretary access to your account without revealing or changing your pass- word, and with only the ability to run the email program. No system-administrator privileges are required to set up this restricted access.  This topic is the focus of Chapter 8.   Port Forwarding  1.4.6 SSH can increase the security of other TCP IP-based applications such as telnet, ftp, and the X Window System. A technique called port forwarding or tunneling reroutes  8    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   a TCP IP connection to pass through an SSH connection, transparently encrypting it end to end. Port forwarding can also pass such applications through network fire- walls that otherwise prevent their use.  Suppose you are logged into a machine away from work and want to access the inter- nal news server at your office, news.yoyodyne.com. The Yoyodyne network is con- nected to the Internet, but a network firewall blocks incoming connections to most ports, particularly port 119, the news port. The firewall does allow incoming SSH connections, however, since the SSH protocol is secure enough that even Yoyo- dyne’s rabidly paranoid system administrators trust it. SSH can establish a secure tunnel on an arbitrary local TCP port—say, port 3002—to the news port on the remote host. The command might look a bit cryptic at this early stage, but here it is:  $ ssh -L 3002:localhost:119 news.yoyodyne.com  This says “ssh, please establish a secure connection from TCP port 3002 on my local machine to TCP port 119, the news port, on news.yoyodyne.com.” So, in order to read news securely, configure your news-reading program to connect to port 3002 on your local machine. The secure tunnel created by ssh automatically communicates with the news server on news.yoyodyne.com, and the news traffic passing through the tunnel is protected by encryption. [9.1]  History of SSH  1.5 SSH1 and the SSH-1 protocol were developed in 1995 by Tatu Ylönen, a researcher at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland. After his university network was the victim of a password-sniffing attack earlier that year, Ylönen whipped up SSH1 for himself. When beta versions started gaining attention, however, he realized his security product could be put to wider use.  In July 1995, SSH1 was released to the public as free software with source code, per- mitting people to copy and use the program without cost. By the end of the year, an estimated 20,000 users in 50 countries had adopted SSH1, and Ylönen was fending off 150 email messages per day requesting support. In response, Ylönen founded SSH Communications Security Corp.,  SCS, http:  www.ssh.com   in December of 1995 to maintain, commercialize, and continue development of SSH. Today he is a board member and technical advisor to the company.  Also in 1995, Ylönen documented the SSH-1 protocol as an Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  Internet Draft, which essentially described the operation of the SSH1 software after the fact. It was a somewhat ad hoc protocol with a number of problems and limitations discovered as the software grew in popularity. These prob- lems couldn’t be fixed without losing backward compatibility, so in 1996, SCS intro- duced a new, major version of the protocol, SSH 2.0 or SSH-2, that incorporates new algorithms and is incompatible with SSH-1. In response, the IETF formed a working  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.5 History of SSH    9   group called Secure Shell  SECSH  to standardize the protocol and guide its develop- ment in the public interest. The SECSH working group submitted the first Internet Draft for the SSH-2.0 protocol in February 1997.  In 1998, SCS released the software product SSH Secure Shell  SSH2 , based on the superior SSH-2 protocol. However, SSH2 didn’t replace SSH1 in the field: it was missing some features of SSH1 and had a more restrictive license, so many users felt little reason to switch, even though SSH-2 is a better and more secure protocol.  This situation changed with the appearance of OpenSSH  http:  www.openssh.com  , a free implementation of the SSH-2 protocol from the OpenBSD project  http:  www. openbsd.org  . It was based on the last free release of the original SSH, 1.2.12, but developed rapidly into one of the reigning SSH implementations in the world. Though many people have contributed to it, OpenSSH is largely the work of soft- ware developer Markus Friedl. It has been ported successfully to Linux, Solaris, AIX, Mac OS X, and other operating systems, in tight synchronization with the OpenBSD releases.  in some cases beyond what SCS has continued to improve its SSH products, OpenSSH supports. Its product line now carries the name Tectia. And nowadays there are dozens of SSH implementations, both free and commercial, for virtually all platforms. Millions of people use it worldwide to secure their communications.  Related Technologies  1.6 SSH is popular and convenient, but we certainly don’t claim it is the ultimate secu- rity solution for all networks. Authentication, encryption, and network security origi- nated long before SSH and have been incorporated into many other systems. Let’s survey a few representative systems.  rsh Suite  r-Commands   1.6.1 The Unix programs rsh, rlogin, and rcp—collectively known as the r-commands—are the direct ancestors of the SSH clients ssh, slogin, and scp. The user interfaces and visible functionality are nearly identical to their SSH counterparts, except that SSH clients are secure. The r-commands, in contrast, don’t encrypt their connections and have a weak, easily subverted authentication model.  An r-command server relies on two mechanisms for security: a network naming ser- vice and the notion of “privileged” TCP ports. Upon receiving a connection from a client, the server obtains the network address of the originating host and translates it into a hostname. This hostname must be present in a configuration file on the server, typically  etc hosts.equiv, for the server to permit access. The server also checks that the source TCP port number is in the range 1–1023, since these port numbers can be used only by the Unix superuser  or root uid . If the connection passes both checks,  10    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   the server believes it is talking to a trusted program on a trusted host and logs in the client as whatever user it requests!  These two security checks are easily subverted. The translation of a network address to a hostname is done by a naming service such as Sun’s Network Information Ser- vice  NIS  or the Internet Domain Name System  DNS . Most implementations and  or deployments of NIS and DNS services have security holes, presenting opportuni- ties to trick the server into trusting a host it shouldn’t. Then, a remote user can log into someone else’s account on the server simply by having the same username.  Likewise, blind trust in privileged TCP ports represents a serious security risk. A cracker who gains root privilege on a trusted machine can simply run a tailored ver- sion of the rsh client and log in as any user on the server host. Overall, reliance on these port numbers is no longer trustworthy in a world of desktop computers whose users have administrative access as a matter of course, or whose operating systems don’t sup- port multiple users or privileges  such as Windows 9x and Macintosh OS 9 .  If user databases on trusted hosts were always synchronized with the server, instal- lation of privileged programs  setuid root  strictly monitored, root privileges guar- anteed to be held by trusted people, and the physical network protected, the r- commands would be reasonably secure. These assumptions made sense in the early days of networking, when hosts were few, expensive, and overseen by a small and trusted group of administrators, but they have far outlived their usefulness.  Given SSH’s superior security features and that ssh is backward-compatible with rsh  and scp with rcp , we see no compelling reason to run the r-commands anymore. Install SSH and be happy.  1.6.2  Pretty Good Privacy  PGP  and GNU Privacy Guard  GnuPG   PGP is a popular encryption program available for many computing platforms, cre- ated by Phil Zimmerman. It can authenticate users and encrypt data files and email messages. GnuPG is a more powerful successor to PGP with less-restrictive licensing.  SSH incorporates some of the same encryption algorithms as PGP and GnuPG, but applied in a different way. PGP is file-based, typically encrypting one file or email message at a time on a single computer. SSH, in contrast, encrypts an ongoing ses- sion between networked computers. The difference between PGP and SSH is like that between a batch job and an interactive process.  PGP and SSH are related in another way as well: Tectia can optionally use PGP keys for authentication. [5.4.5]  More PGP and GnuPG information is available at http:  www.pgp.com  and http:   www.gnupg.org , respectively.

All rights reserved.  1.6 Related Technologies    11   Kerberos  1.6.3 Kerberos is a secure authentication system for environments where networks may be monitored, and computers aren’t under central control. It was developed as part of Project Athena, a wide-ranging research and development effort at the Massachu- setts Institute of Technology  MIT . Kerberos authenticates users by way of tickets, small sequences of bytes with limited lifetimes, while user passwords remain secure on a central machine.  Kerberos and SSH solve similar problems but are quite different in scope. SSH is lightweight and easily deployed, designed to work on existing systems with minimal changes. To enable secure access from one machine to another, simply install an SSH client on the first and a server on the second, and start the server. Kerberos, in con- trast, requires significant infrastructure to be established before use, such as adminis- trative user accounts, a heavily secured central host, and software for networkwide clock synchronization. In return for this added complexity, Kerberos ensures that users’ passwords travel on the network as little as possible and are stored only on the central host. SSH sends passwords across the network  over encrypted connections, of course  on each login and stores keys on each host from which SSH is used. Ker- beros also serves other purposes beyond the scope of SSH, including a centralized user account database, access control lists, and a hierarchical model of trust.  Another difference between SSH and Kerberos is the approach to securing client applications. SSH can easily secure most TCP IP-based programs via a technique called port-forwarding. Kerberos, on the other hand, contains a set of programming libraries for adding authentication and encryption to other applications. Developers can integrate applications with Kerberos by modifying their source code to make calls to the Kerberos libraries. The MIT Kerberos distribution comes with a set of common services that have been “kerberized,” including secure versions of telnet, ftp, and rsh.  If the features of both Kerberos and SSH sound good, you’re in luck: they’ve been integrated. [11.4] More information on Kerberos can be found at http:  web.mit.edu  kerberos www .  IPSEC and Virtual Private Networks  1.6.4 Internet Protocol Security  IPSEC  is an Internet standard for network security. Developed by an IETF working group, IPSEC comprises authentication and encryp- tion implemented at the IP level. This is a lower level of the network stack than SSH addresses. It is entirely transparent to end users, who don’t need to use a particular program such as SSH to gain security; rather, their existing insecure network traffic is protected automatically by the underlying system. IPSEC can securely connect a sin- gle machine to a remote network through an intervening untrusted network  such as  12    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   the Internet , or it can connect entire networks  this is the idea of the Virtual Private Network, or VPN .  SSH is often quicker and easier to deploy as a solution than IPSEC, since SSH is a simple application program, whereas IPSEC requires additions to the host operating systems on both sides if they don’t already come with it, and possibly to network equipment such as routers, depending on the scenario. SSH also provides user authentication, whereas IPSEC deals only with individual hosts. On the other hand, IPSEC is more basic protection and can do things SSH can’t. For instance, in Chapter 11 we discuss the difficulties of trying to protect the FTP protocol using SSH. If you need to secure an existing insecure protocol such as FTP, which isn’t amenable to treatment with SSH, IPSEC is a way to do it.  IPSEC can provide authentication alone, through a means called the Authentication Header  AH , or both authentication and encryption, using a protocol called Encap- sulated Security Payload  ESP . Detailed information on IPSEC can be found at http:   www.ietf.org html.charters ipsec-charter.html.  Secure Remote Password  SRP   1.6.5 The Secure Remote Password  SRP  protocol, created at Stanford University, is a security protocol very different in scope from SSH. It is specifically an authentication protocol, whereas SSH comprises authentication, encryption, integrity, session man- agement, etc., as an integrated whole. SRP isn’t a complete security solution in itself, but rather, a technology that can be a part of a security system.  The design goal of SRP is to improve on the security properties of password-style authentication, while retaining its considerable practical advantages. Using SSH pub- lic-key authentication is difficult if you’re traveling, especially if you’re not carrying your own computer, but instead are using other people’s machines. You have to carry your private key on a portable storage device and hope that you can get the key into whatever machine you need to use.  Carrying your encrypted private key with you is also a weakness, because if someone steals it, they can subject it to a dictionary attack in which they try to find your pass- phrase and recover the key. Then you’re back to the age-old problem with pass- words: to be useful they must be short and memorable, whereas to be secure, they must be long and random.  SRP provides strong two-party mutual authentication, with the client needing only to remember a short password which need not be so strongly random. With traditional password schemes, the server maintains a sensitive database that must be protected, such as the passwords themselves, or hashed versions of them  as in the Unix  etc  passwd and  etc shadow files . That data must be kept secret, since disclosure allows an attacker to impersonate users or discover their passwords through a dictionary  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  1.6 Related Technologies    13   attack. The design of SRP avoids such a database and allows passwords to be less random  and therefore more memorable and useful , since it prevents dictionary attacks. The server still has sensitive data that should be protected, but the conse- quences of its disclosure are less severe.  SRP is also intentionally designed to avoid using encryption algorithms in its opera- tion. Thus it avoids running afoul of cryptographic export laws, which prohibits cer- tain encryption technologies from being shared with foreign countries.  SRP is an interesting technology we hope gains wider acceptance; it is an excellent candidate for an additional authentication method in SSH. The current SRP imple- mentation includes secure clients and servers for the Telnet and FTP protocols for Unix and Windows. More SRP information can be found at http:  srp.stanford.edu .  Secure Socket Layer  SSL  Protocol  1.6.6 The Secure Socket Layer  SSL  protocol is an authentication and encryption tech- nique providing security services to TCP clients by way of a Berkeley sockets-style API. It was initially developed by Netscape Communications Corporation to secure the HTTP protocol between web clients and servers, and that is still its primary use, though nothing about it is specific to HTTP. It is on the IETF standards track as RFC-2246, under the name “TLS” for Transport Layer Security.  An SSL participant proves its identity by a digital certificate, a set of cryptographic data. A certificate indicates that a trusted third party has verified the binding between an identity and a given cryptographic key. Web browsers automatically check the certificate provided by a web server when they connect by SSL, ensuring that the server is the one the user intended to contact. Thereafter, transmissions between the browser and the web server are encrypted.  SSL is used most often for web applications, but it can also “tunnel” other protocols. It is secure only if a “trusted third party” exists. Organizations known as certificate authorities  CAs  serve this function. If a company wants a certificate from the CA, the company must prove its identity to the CA through other means, such as legal documents. Once the proof is sufficient, the CA issues the certificate.  For more information, visit the OpenSSL project at http:  www.openssl.org .  SSL-Enhanced Telnet and FTP  1.6.7 Numerous TCP-based communication programs have been enhanced with SSL, including telnet  e.g., SSLtelnet, SRA telnet, SSLTel, STel  and ftp  SSLftp , provid- ing some of the functionality of SSH. Though useful, these tools are fairly single- purpose and typically are patched or hacked versions of programs not originally writ- ten for secure communication. The major SSH implementations, on the other hand,  14    Chapter 1:  Introduction to SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   are more like integrated toolsets with diverse uses, written from the ground up for security.  stunnel  1.6.8 stunnel is an SSL tool created by Micha Trojnara of Poland. It adds SSL protection to existing TCP-based services in a Unix environment, such as POP or IMAP servers, without requiring changes to the server source code. It can be invoked from inetd as a wrapper for any number of service daemons or run standalone, accepting network connections itself for a particular service. stunnel performs authentication and autho- rization of incoming connections via SSL; if the connection is allowed, it runs the server and implements an SSL-protected session between the client and server programs.  This is especially useful because certain popular applications have the option of run- ning some client server protocols over SSL. For instance, email clients like Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Mail can connect to POP, IMAP, and SMTP servers using SSL. For more stunnel information, see http:  www.stunnel.org .  Firewalls  1.6.9 A firewall is a hardware device or software program that prevents certain data from entering or exiting a network. For example, a firewall placed between a web site and the Internet might permit only HTTP and HTTPS traffic to reach the site. As another example, a firewall can reject all TCP IP packets unless they originate from a desig- nated set of network addresses.  Firewalls aren’t a replacement for SSH or other authentication and encryption approaches, but they do address similar problems. The techniques may be used together.  Summary  1.7 SSH is a powerful, convenient approach to protecting communications on a com- puter network. Through secure authentication and encryption technologies, SSH supports secure remote logins, secure remote command execution, secure file trans- fers, access control, TCP IP port forwarding, and other important features.

This chapter is designed to get you started with SSH quickly. We cover the basics of SSH’s most immediately useful features:    Logging into a remote computer over a secure connection   Transferring files between computers over a secure connection  We also introduce authentication with cryptographic keys, a more secure alternative to ordinary passwords. Advanced uses of client programs, such as multiple keys, cli- ent configuration files, and TCP port forwarding, are covered in later chapters. Our examples in this chapter work with OpenSSH and Tectia on Linux and other Unix- inspired operating systems.  A Running Example  2.1 Suppose you’re out of town on a business trip and want to access your files, which sit on a Unix machine belonging to your ISP, shell.isp.com. A friend at a nearby uni- versity agrees to let you log into her Linux account on the machine local.university. edu, and then remotely log into yours. For the remote login you could use the telnet program, but as we’ve seen, this connection between the machines is insecure.  No doubt some subversive college student would grab your password and turn your account into a renegade web server for pirated software and death metal MP3s.  For- tunately, both your friend’s machine and your ISP’s have an SSH product installed.  In the example running through the chapter, we represent the shell prompt of the local machine, local.university.edu, as a dollar sign  $  and the prompt on shell.isp.com as shell.isp.com>.  Remote Terminal Sessions with ssh  2.2 Suppose your remote username on shell.isp.com is pat. To connect to your remote account from your friend’s account on local.university.edu, you type:  16  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   $ ssh -l pat shell.isp.com pat's password: ****** Last login: Mon Aug 16 19:32:51 2004 from quondam.nefertiti.org You have new mail. shell.isp.com>  This leads to the situation shown in Figure 2-1. The ssh command runs a client that contacts the SSH server on shell.isp.com over the Internet, asking to be logged into the remote account with username pat.* You can also provide user@host syntax instead of the –l option to accomplish the same thing:  $ ssh pat@shell.isp.com  University Network  SSH Client  local.university.edu  Figure 2-1. Our example scenario  Internet  secure SSH protocol  ISP Network  SSH Server  shell.isp.com  On first contact, SSH establishes a secure channel between the client and the server so that all transmissions between them are encrypted. The client then prompts for your password, which it supplies to the server over the secure channel. The server authenticates you by checking that the password is correct and permits the login. All subsequent client server exchanges are protected by that secure channel, including everything you type into the SSH application and everything it displays to you from shell.isp.com.  It’s important to remember that the secure channel exists only between the SSH cli- ent and server machines. After logging into shell.isp.com via ssh, if you then telnet or ftp to a third machine, insecure.isp.com, the connection between shell.isp.com and insecure.isp.com is not secure. However, you can run another ssh client from shell.isp. com to insecure.isp.com, creating another secure channel, which keeps the chain of connections secure.  We’ve covered only the simplest use of ssh. Chapter 7 goes into far greater depth about its many features and options.  File Transfer with scp  2.2.1 Continuing the story, suppose that while browsing your files, you encounter a PDF file you’d like to print. In order to send the file to a local printer at the university, you  * If the local and remote usernames are identical, you can omit the –l option  –l pat  and just type ssh shell.  isp.com.  2.2 Remote Terminal Sessions with ssh    17  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   must first transfer the file to local.university.edu. Once again, you reject as insecure the traditional file-transfer programs, such as ftp. Instead, you use another SSH cli- ent program, scp, to copy the file across the network via a secure channel.  First, you write the attachment to a file in your home directory on shell.isp.com using your mail client, naming the file printme.pdf. When you’ve finished reading your other email messages, log out of shell.isp.com, ending the SSH session and returning to the shell prompt on local.university.edu. You’re now ready to copy the file securely.  The scp program has syntax much like the traditional Unix cp program for copying files.* It is roughly:  scp name-of-source name-of-destination  In this example, scp copies the file printme.pdf on shell.isp.com over the network to a local file in your friend’s account on local.university.edu, also called printme.pdf:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf printme.pdf  The file is transferred over an SSH-secured connection. The source and destination files may be specified not only by filename, but also by username  “pat” in our exam- ple  and hostname  shell.isp.com , indicating the location of the file on the network. Depending on your needs, various parts of the source or destination name can be omitted, and default values used. For example, omitting the username and the at sign  pat@  makes scp assume that the remote username is the same as the local one.  Like ssh, scp prompts for your remote password and passes it to the SSH server for verification. If successful, scp logs into the pat account on shell.isp.com, copies your remote file printme.pdf to the local file printme.pdf, and logs out of shell.isp.com. The local file printme.pdf may now be sent to a printer.  The destination filename need not be the same as the remote one. For example, if you’re feeling French, you could call the local file imprime-moi.pdf:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf imprime-moi.pdf  The full syntax of scp can represent local and remote files in powerful ways, and the program also has numerous command-line options. [7.5]  Adding Complexity to the Example  2.3 The preceding example session provided a quick introduction to the most often-used client programs—ssh and scp—in a format to follow while sitting at your computer. Now that you have the basics, let’s continue the example but include situations and complications glossed over the first time. These include the “known hosts” security feature and the SSH escape character.  * Actually it’s modeled after the old rcp program for copying files insecurely between machines.  18    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If you’re following at the computer as you read, your SSH clients might behave unexpectedly or differently from ours. As you will see throughout the book, SSH implementations are highly customizable, by both yourself and the system administrator, on either side of the secure connection. Although this chapter describes common behav- iors of SSH programs based on their installation defaults, your system might be set up differently. If commands don’t work as you expect, try adding the –v  “verbose”  command-line option, for example:  $ ssh -v shell.isp.com  This causes the client to print lots of information about its progress, often revealing the source of the discrepancy.  Known Hosts  2.3.1 The first time an SSH client encounters a new remote machine, it may report that it’s never seen the machine before, printing a message like the following:  $ ssh -l pat shell.isp.com The authenticity of host 'shell.isp.com  192.168.0.2 ' can't be established. RSA key fingerprint is 77:a5:69:81:9b:eb:40:76:7b:13:04:a9:6c:f4:9c:5d. Are you sure you want to continue connecting  yes no ?  Assuming you respond yes  the most common response , the client continues:  Warning: Permanently added 'shell.isp.com,192.168.0.2'  RSA  to the list of known hosts.  This message appears only the first time you contact a particular remote host. The message is a security feature related to SSH’s concept of known hosts.*  Suppose an adversary wants to obtain your password. He knows you are using SSH, and so he can’t monitor your connection by eavesdropping on the network. Instead, he subverts the naming service used by your local host so that the name of your intended remote host, shell.isp.com, translates falsely to the IP address of a computer run by him! He then installs an altered SSH server on the phony remote host and waits. When you log in via your trusty SSH client, the altered SSH server records your password for the adversary’s later use  or misuse, more likely . The bogus server can then disconnect with a preplanned error message such as “System down for maintenance—please try again after 4:00 p.m.” Even worse, it can fool you com- pletely by using your password to log into the real shell.isp.com and transparently pass information back and forth between you and the server, monitoring your entire session. This hostile strategy is called a man-in-the-middle attack. [3.9.4] Unless you  * Depending on your client configuration, ssh might print a different message and automatically accept or  reject the connection. [7.4.3.1]  2.3 Adding Complexity to the Example    19  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   think to check the originating IP address of your session on the server, you might never notice the deception.  The SSH known-host mechanism prevents such attacks. When an SSH client and server make a connection, each of them proves its identity to the other. Yes, not only does the server authenticate the client, as we saw earlier when the server checked Pat’s password, but the client also authenticates the server by public-key cryptogra- phy. [3.4.3.6] In short, each SSH server has a secret, unique ID, called a host key, to identify itself to clients. The first time you connect to a remote host, a public coun- terpart of the host key gets copied and stored in your local account  assuming you responded “yes” to the client’s prompt about host keys, earlier . Each time you reconnect to that remote host, the SSH client checks the remote host’s identity using this public key.  Of course, it’s better to have recorded the server’s public host key before connecting to it the first time, since otherwise you are technically open to a man-in-the-middle attack that first time. Administrators can maintain systemwide known-hosts lists for given sets of hosts, but this doesn’t do much good for connecting to random new hosts around the world. Until a reliable, widely deployed method of verifying such keys securely exists  such as secure DNS, or X.509-based public-key infrastructure , this record-on-first-use mechanism is an acceptable compromise.  If authentication of the server fails, various things may happen depending on the rea- son for failure and the SSH configuration. Typically a warning appears on the screen, ranging from a repeat of the known-hosts message:  Host key not found from the list of known hosts. Are you sure you want to continue connecting  yes no ?  to more dire words:  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY! Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now  man-in-the-middle attack ! It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed. The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is 77:a5:69:81:9b:eb:40:76:7b:13:04:a9:6c:f4:9c:5d. Please contact your system administrator. Add correct host key in  home smith .ssh known_hosts to get rid of this message. Offending key in  home smith .ssh known_hosts:36  If you answer yes, ssh allows the connection, but disables various features as a secu- rity precaution and doesn’t update your personal known-hosts database with the new key; you must do that yourself to make this message go away.  As the text of the message says, if you see this warning, you aren’t necessarily being hacked: for example, the remote host key may have legitimately changed for some  20    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

If you need assistance, contact your system administrator or a knowledge- able friend, rather than take a chance and possibly compromise your password. We’ll cover these issues further when we discuss personal known hosts databases and how to alter the behavior of SSH clients with respect to host keys. [7.4.3]  The Escape Character  2.3.2 Let us return to the shell.isp.com example, just after you’d discovered the attachment in your remote email message and saved it to the remote file printme.pdf. In our origi- nal example, you then logged out of shell.isp.com and ran scp to transfer the file. But what if you don’t want to log out? If you’re using a workstation running a window system, you can open a new window and run scp. But if you’re using a lowly text ter- minal, or you’re not familiar with the window system running on your friend’s com- puter, there is an alternative. You can temporarily interrupt the SSH connection, transfer the file  and run any other local commands you desire , and then resume the connection.  ssh supports an escape character, a designated character that gets the attention of the SSH client. Normally, ssh sends every character you type to the server, but the escape character is caught by the client, alerting it that special commands may follow. By default, the escape character is the tilde  ~ , but you can change it. To reduce the chances of sending the escape character unintentionally, that character must be the first character on the command line, i.e., following a newline  Control-J  or return  Control-M  character. If not, the client treats it literally, not as an escape character.  After the escape character gets the client’s attention, the next character entered deter- mines the effect of the escape. For example, the escape character followed by a Control-Z suspends ssh like any other shell job, returning control to the local shell. Such a pair of characters is called an escape sequence. We cover these in detail in a later chapter. [7.4.6.8]  To change the ssh escape character, use the –e command-line option. For example, type the following to make the percent sign  %  the escape character when connect- ing to shell.isp.com as user pat:  $ ssh -e "%" -l pat shell.isp.com  Authentication by Cryptographic Key  2.4 In our running example, the user pat is authenticated by the SSH server via login password. Passwords, however, have serious drawbacks:    In order for a password to be secure, it should be long and random, but such  passwords are hard to memorize.  2.4 Authentication by Cryptographic Key    21  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     A password sent across the network, even protected by an SSH secure channel, can be captured when it arrives on the remote host if that host has been compro- mised.    Most operating systems support only a single password per account. For shared  accounts  e.g., a superuser account , this presents difficulties: — Password changes are inconvenient because the new password must be com-  municated to all people with access to the account.  — Tracking usage of the account becomes difficult because the operating sys-  tem doesn’t distinguish between the different users of the account.  To address these problems, SSH supports public-key authentication: instead of rely- ing on the password scheme of the host operating system, SSH may use crypto- graphic keys. [3.2.2] Keys are more secure than passwords in general and address all the weaknesses mentioned earlier.  A Brief Introduction to Keys  2.4.1 A key is a digital identity. It’s a unique string of binary data that means “This is me, honestly, I swear.” And with a little cryptographic magic, your SSH client can prove to a server that its key is genuine, and you are really you.  An SSH identity uses a pair of keys, one private and one public. The private key is a closely guarded secret only you have. Your SSH clients use it to prove your identity to servers. The public key is, like the name says, public. You place it freely into your accounts on SSH server machines. During authentication, the SSH client and server have a little conversation about your private and public key. If they match  accord- ing to a cryptographic test , your identity is proven, and authentication succeeds.  The following sequence demonstrates the conversation between client and server. [3. 4.2.4]  It occurs behind the scenes, so you don’t need to memorize it or anything; we just thought you might be interested.   1. Your client says, “Hey server, I’d like to connect by SSH to an account on your  system, specifically, the account owned by user smith.”  2. The server says, “Well, maybe. First, I challenge you to prove your identity!”  And the server sends some data, known as a challenge, to the client.  3. Your client says, “I accept your challenge. Here is proof of my identity. I made it myself by mathematically using your challenge and my private key.” This response to the server is called an authenticator.  4. The server says, “Thanks for the authenticator. I will now examine the smith account to see if you may enter.” Specifically, the server checks smith’s public keys to see if the authenticator “matches” any of them.  The “match” is another cryptographic operation.  If so, the server says, “OK, come on in!” Otherwise, the authentication fails.  22    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Before you can use public-key authentication, some setup is required:    You need a private key and a public key, known collectively as a key pair. You  also need a secret passphrase to protect your private key. [2.4.2]    You need to install your public key on an SSH server machine. [2.4.3]  Generating Key Pairs with ssh-keygen  2.4.2 To use cryptographic authentication, you must first generate a key pair for yourself, consisting of a private key  your digital identity that sits on the client machine  and a public key  that sits on the server machine . To do this, use the ssh-keygen program to produce either a DSA or RSA key. The OpenSSH version of ssh-keygen requires you to specify the key type with the –t option  there is no default :  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa Generating public private dsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key   home dbarrett .ssh id_dsa : press ENTER Enter passphrase  empty for no passphrase : ******** Enter same passphrase again: ******** Your identification has been saved in  home pat .ssh id_dsa. Your public key has been saved in  home pat .ssh id_dsa.pub. The key fingerprint is: 14:ba:06:98:a8:98:ad:27:b5:ce:55:85:ec:64:37:19 pat@shell.isp.com  On Tectia systems, ssh-keygen produces a DSA key by default, and also accepts the –t option:  $ ssh-keygen Generating 2048-bit dsa key pair    1 ..oOo.oOo.oO    2 o.oOo.oOo.oO    3 o.oOo.oOo.oO  The program displays a “ripple” pattern to indicate progress; the characters are actually  overwritten on a single line   28 o.oOo.oOo.oO Key generated. 2048-bit dsa, pat@shell.isp.com, Wed Jan 12 2005 20:22:21 -0500 Passphrase : ************** Again      : ************** Private key saved to  home pat .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a Public key saved to  home pat .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a.pub  Normally, ssh-keygen performs all necessary mathematics to generate a key, but on some operating systems you might be asked to assist it. Key generation requires some random numbers, and if your operating system doesn’t supply a random-number generator, you may be asked to type some random text or wiggle your mouse around. ssh-keygen uses the timings of your keystrokes to initialize its internal random-number generator. On a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 system running Linux, a 1024- bit RSA key generates in less than one second; if your hardware is slower or heavily loaded, generation could take minutes. It can also take longer if the process runs out of random bits and ssh-keygen waits to collect more.  2.4 Authentication by Cryptographic Key    23  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ssh-keygen then creates your local SSH directory  ~ .ssh for OpenSSH or ~ .ssh2 for Tectia  if it doesn’t already exist, and stores the private and public components of the generated key in two files there. By default, their names are id_dsa and id_dsa.pub  OpenSSH  or id_dsa_2048_a and id_dsa_2048_a.pub  Tectia . SSH clients consider these to be your default identity for authentication purposes.  Never reveal your private key and passphrase to anyone. They are just as sensitive as your login password. Anyone possessing them can impersonate you!  When created, the identity file is readable only by your account, and its contents are further protected by encrypting them with the passphrase you supplied during gener- ation. We say “passphrase” instead of “password” both to differentiate it from a login password, and to stress that spaces and punctuation are allowed and encour- aged. We recommend a passphrase at least 10–15 characters long and not a gram- matical sentence.  ssh-keygen has numerous options for managing keys: changing the passphrase, choosing a different name for the key file, and so forth. [6.2]  Installing a Public Key on an SSH Server Machine  2.4.3 When passwords are used for authentication, the host operating system maintains the association between the username and the password. For cryptographic keys, you must set up a similar association manually. After creating the key pair on the local host, you must install your public key in your account on the remote host. A remote account may have many public keys installed for accessing it in various ways.  Returning to our running example, you must install a public key into the pat account on shell.isp.com. This is done by editing a file in the SSH configuration directory: ~ .ssh  authorized_keys for OpenSSH or ~ .ssh2 authorization for Tectia.  Instructions for OpenSSH  2.4.3.1 Create or edit the remote file ~ .ssh authorized_keys and append your public key—i.e., the contents of the id_dsa.pub file you generated on the local machine. A typical authorized_keys file contains a list of public-key data, one key per line. The example contains only two public keys, each on its own line of the file, but they are too long to fit on this page. The line breaks inside the long numbers are printing artifacts; if they were actually in the file, it would be incorrectly formatted and wouldn’t work:  ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAACBAMCiL15WEI+0dFJZ9InMSh4PAZ3eFO7YJBFZ6ybl7ld+807z  jnXGghYVuvKbHdNlRYWidhdFWtDW3l5v8Ce7nyYhcQU7x+j4JeUf7qmLmQxlu0v+O5rlg7L5U2RuW94yt1BGj +xk7vzLwOhKHE +YFVz52sFNazoYXqPnm1pRPRAAAAFQDGjroMj+ML= jones@client2.com  24    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

[8.2.1]  Instructions for Tectia  2.4.3.2 For Tectia you need to edit two files, one on the client machine and one on the server machine. On the client machine, create or edit the file ~ .ssh2 identification and insert a line to identify your private-key file:  IdKey id_dsa_2048_a  On the server machine, create or edit the file ~ .ssh2 authorization, which contains information about public keys, one per line. But unlike OpenSSH’s authorized_keys file, which contains copies of the public keys, the authorization file lists only the file- name of the key:  Key id_dsa_2048_a.pub  Finally, copy id_dsa_2048_a.pub from your local machine to the remote Tectia server machine, placing it in ~ .ssh2.  Regardless of which SSH implementation you use, make sure your remote SSH direc- tory and associated files are writable only by your account:*   OpenSSH $ chmod 755 ~ .ssh $ chmod 644 ~ .ssh authorized_keys   Tectia $ chmod 755 ~ .ssh2 $ chmod 644 ~ .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a.pub $ chmod 644 ~ .ssh2 authorization  The SSH server is picky about file and directory permissions and may refuse authentication if the remote account’s SSH configuration files have insecure per- missions. [5.3.2.1]  You are now ready to use your new key to access the pat account:  $ ssh -l pat shell.isp.com Enter passphrase for key ' home you .ssh id_dsa': ************ Last login: Mon Aug 16 19:44:21 2004 from quincunx.nefertiti.org You have new mail. shell.isp.com>  If all goes well, you are logged into the remote account. Figure 2-2 shows the entire process.  * We make files world-readable and directories world-searchable, to avoid NFS problems. [10.7.2] But if  StrictModes is enabled in the server, you’ll need to make these permissions more restrictive. [5.3.2.1]  2.4 Authentication by Cryptographic Key    25  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Installing OpenSSH Keys with ssh-copy-id  OpenSSH includes a program, ssh-copy-id, that installs a public key automatically on a remote server with a single command, placing it into ~ .ssh authorized_keys:  ssh-copy-id -i key_file [user@]server_name  For example, to install the key mykey in the dulaney account on server.example.com:  $ ssh-copy-id -i mykey dulaney@server.example.com  You don’t need to list the .pub extension of the key file; or more specifically, you can provide either the private or public-key file, and the public key is copied to the remote server. In order for the copy to take place, you’ll need an account on the remote machine, of course, and you’ll need to authenticate somehow. If you’ve never set up public-key authentication on server.example.com before, you’ll be prompted for your login pass- word. ssh-copy-id is convenient, but it has some subtle issues:    If you have no authorized_keys file on the remote machine, ssh-copy-id creates  one containing your new key; otherwise, it appends the new key.    If you do already have a remote authorized_keys file, and it does not end with a newline character, ssh-copy-id blindly appends your new key onto the last pub- lic key in the file, with no newline between them. This effectively corrupts the last two keys in authorized_keys. Moral: always make sure authorized_keys ends with a newline.  This is easy to overlook, especially when running OpenSSH on Windows. [14.4]     The syntax of ssh-copy-id is similar to that of scp, the secure copy program, but there’s an important difference: scp follows the hostname of the remote machine with a colon. Don’t use a colon with ssh-copy-id or you’ll get an error message, “Name or service not known,” as the hostname lookup fails.  Before you use ssh-copy-id to simplify or hide the details of public-key authentication, we recommend that you understand how to set it up manually. This point is often true of security-related software: you should know how and why it works.  Note the similarity to the earlier example with password authentication. [2.2] On the surface, the only difference is that you provide the passphrase to your private key, instead of providing your login password. Underneath, however, something quite different is happening. In password authentication, the password is transmitted to the remote host. With cryptographic authentication, the passphrase serves only to decrypt the private key to create an authenticator. [2.4.1]  Public-key authentication is more secure than password authentication because:  26    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Public-key authentication    It requires two secret components—the identity file on disk, and the passphrase in your head—so both must be captured in order for an adversary to access your account. Password authentication requires only one component, the password, which might be easier to steal.    Neither the passphrase nor the key is sent to the remote host, just the authenti- cator discussed earlier. Therefore, no secret information is transmitted off the client machine.    Machine-generated cryptographic keys are infeasible to guess. Human-gener- ated passwords are routinely cracked by a password-guessing technique called a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack may be mounted on the passphrase as well, but this requires stealing the private-key file first.  A host’s security can be greatly increased by disabling password authentication alto- gether and permitting only SSH connections by key.  If You Change Your Key  2.4.4 Suppose you have generated a key pair, id_dsa and id_dsa.pub, and copied id_dsa.pub to a bunch of SSH server machines. All is well. Then one day, you decide to change your identity, so you run ssh-keygen a second time, overwriting id_dsa and id_dsa. pub. Guess what? Your previous public-key file is now invalid, and you must copy the new public key to all those SSH server machines again. This is a maintenance headache, so think carefully before changing  destroying!  a key pair. Some caveats:    You are not limited to one key pair. You can generate as many as you like, stored  in different files, and use them for diverse purposes. [6.4]    If you just want to change your passphrase, you don’t have to generate a new key pair. ssh-keygen has command-line options for replacing the passphrase of an existing key: –p for OpenSSH [6.2.1] and –e for Tectia [6.2.2]. In this case your public key remains valid since the private key hasn’t changed, just the pass- phrase for decrypting it.  2.4 Authentication by Cryptographic Key    27  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The SSH Agent  2.5 Each time you run ssh or scp with public-key authentication, you have to retype your passphrase. The first few times you might not mind, but eventually this retyping gets annoying. Wouldn’t it be nicer to identify yourself just once and have ssh and scp remember your identity until further notice  for example, until you log out , not prompting for your passphrase? In fact, this is just what an SSH agent does for you.  An agent is a program that keeps private keys in memory and provides authentica- tion services to SSH clients. If you preload an agent with private keys at the begin- ning of a login session, your SSH clients won’t prompt for passphrases. Instead, they communicate with the agent as needed. The effects of the agent last until you termi- nate the agent, usually just before logging out. The agent program for both OpenSSH and Tectia is called ssh-agent.  Generally, you run a single ssh-agent in your local login session, before running any SSH clients. You can run the agent by hand, but people usually edit their login files  for example, ~ .login or ~ .xsession  to run the agent automatically. SSH clients com- municate with the agent via a local socket or named pipe whose filename is stored in an environment variable, so all clients  and all other processes  within your login ses- sion have access to the agent. [6.3.4] To try the agent, type:  $ ssh-agent $SHELL  where SHELL is the environment variable containing the name of your login shell. Alternatively, you could supply the name of any other shell, such as sh, bash, csh, tcsh, orksh. The agent runs and then invokes the given shell as a child process. The visual effect is simply that another shell prompt appears, but this shell has access to the agent.  Once the agent is running, it’s time to load private keys into it using the ssh-add pro- gram. By default, ssh-add loads the key from your default identity file:  $ ssh-add Enter passphrase for  home you .ssh id_dsa: ******** Identity added:  home you .ssh id_dsa   home you .ssh id_dsa   Now ssh and scp can connect to remote hosts without prompting for your pass- phrase. Figure 2-3 shows the process.  ssh-add reads the passphrase from your terminal by default or, optionally, from stan- dard input noninteractively. Otherwise, if you are running the X Window System with the DISPLAY environment variable set, and standard input isn’t a terminal, ssh- add reads your passphrase using a graphical X program, ssh-askpass. This behavior is useful when calling ssh-add from X session setup scripts.  To force ssh-add to use X to read the passphrase, type ssh-add <  dev  null at a command line.  28    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

How the SSH agent works  ssh-add has further capabilities and can operate with multiple identity files. [6.3.3] For now, here are a few useful commands. To load a key other than your default identity into the agent, provide the filename as an argument to ssh-add:  $ ssh-add my-other-key-file  You can also list the keys the agent currently holds:  $ ssh-add -l  delete a key from the agent in memory:  $ ssh-add -d name-of-key-file  or delete all keys from the agent in memory:  $ ssh-add -D  When running an SSH agent, don’t leave your terminal unattended while logged in. While your private keys are loaded in an agent, any- one may use your terminal to connect to any remote accounts accessi- ble via those keys, without needing your passphrase! Even worse, a sophisticated intruder can extract your keys from the running agent and steal them. If you use an agent, make sure to lock your terminal if you leave it while logged in. You can also use ssh-add -D to clear your loaded keys and reload them when you return. In addition, ssh-agent can be “locked” by ssh-add, to protect the agent from unauthorized users. [6.3.3]  Agents and Automation  2.5.1 Suppose you have a batch script that runs ssh to launch remote processes. If the script runs ssh many times, it prompts for your passphrase repeatedly, which is inconvenient for automation  not to mention annoying and error-prone . If you run an agent, however, your script can run without a single passphrase prompt. [11.1]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  2.5 The SSH Agent    29   A More Complex Passphrase Problem  2.5.2 In our running example, we copied a file from the remote to the local host:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf imprime-moi.pdf  In fact, scp can copy a file from the remote host shell.isp.com directly to a third host running SSH on which you have an account named, say, “psmith”:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf psmith@other.host.net:imprime-moi.pdf  Rather than copying the file first to the local host and then back out again to the final destination, this command has shell.isp.com send it directly to other.host.net. How- ever, if you try this, you run into the following problem:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf psmith@other.host.net:imprime-moi.pdf Enter passphrase for RSA key 'Your Name  ': ************ You have no controlling tty and no DISPLAY.  Cannot read passphrase. lost connection  What happened? When you run scp on your local machine, it contacts shell.isp.com and internally invokes a second scp command to do the copy. Unfortunately, the sec- ond scp command also needs the passphrase for your private key. Since there is no terminal session to prompt for the passphrase, the second scp fails, causing the origi- nal scp to fail. The SSH agent solves this problem: the second scp command simply queries your local SSH agent, so no passphrase prompting is needed.  The SSH agent also solves another, more subtle, problem in this example. Without the agent, the second scp  on shell.isp.com  needs access to your private-key file, but the file is on your local machine. So, you have to copy your private key file to shell. isp.com. This isn’t ideal; what if shell.isp.com isn’t a secure machine? Also, the solu- tion doesn’t scale: if you have a dozen different accounts, it is a maintenance head- ache to keep your private key file on all of them. Fortunately, the SSH agent comes to the rescue once again. The remote scp process simply contacts your local SSH agent and authenticates, and the secure copy proceeds successfully, through a process called agent forwarding.  Agent Forwarding  2.5.3 In the preceding example, the remote instance of scp has no direct access to your pri- vate key, since the agent is running on the local host, not the remote host. SSH pro- vides agent forwarding [6.3.5] to address this problem.  When agent forwarding is turned on,* the remote SSH server masquerades as a sec- ond ssh-agent, as shown in Figure 2-4. It takes authentication requests from your SSH client processes there, passes them back over the SSH connection to the local  * It is on by default in Tectia, but off in OpenSSH.  30    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   agent for handling, and relays the results back to the remote clients. In short, remote clients transparently get access to the local ssh-agent. Since any programs executed via ssh on the remote side are children of the server, they all have access to the local agent just as if they were running on the local host.  forwarded request  forwarded  result  SSH Client  result  forwarded request  keys  Agent  Machine X  SSH Server Proxy Agent  request  forwarded  result  SSH Client  Machine Y  Figure 2-4. How agent forwarding works  In our double-remote scp example, here is what happens when agent forwarding comes into play  see Figure 2-5 :  1. You run the command on your local machine:  $ scp pat@shell.isp.com:printme.pdf psmith@other.host.net:imprime-moi.pdf  2. This scp process contacts your local agent and authenticates you to shell.isp.com. 3. A second scp command is automatically launched on shell.isp.com to carry out  4. Since agent forwarding is turned on, the SSH server on shell.isp.com poses as an  the copy to other.host.net.  agent.  5. The second scp process tries to authenticate you to other.host.net by contacting  the “agent” that is really the SSH server on shell.isp.com.  6. Behind the scenes, the SSH server on shell.isp.com communicates with your local agent, which constructs an authenticator proving your identity and passes it back to the server.  7. The server verifies your identity to the second scp process, and authentication  succeeds on other.host.net.  8. The file copying occurs.

Third-party scp with agent forwarding  Agent forwarding works over multiple connections in a series, allowing you to ssh from one machine to another, and then to another, with the agent connection fol- lowing along the whole way. These machines may be progressively less secure, but agent forwarding doesn’t send your private key to the remote host: it just relays authentication requests back to the first host for processing. Therefore, you don’t have to copy your private key to other machines.  2.6  Connecting Without a Password or Passphrase  One of the most frequently asked questions about SSH is: “How can I connect to a remote machine without having to type a password or passphrase?” As you’ve seen, an SSH agent can make this possible, but there are other methods as well, each with different trade-offs. Here we list the available methods with pointers to the sections discussing each one.  To use SSH clients for interactive sessions without a password or passphrase, you have several options:  32    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Public-key authentication with an agent [2.5] [6.3]   Hostbased authentication [3.4.3.6]   Kerberos authentication [11.4]  Another way to achieve passwordless logins is to use an unencrypted private key with no passphrase. Although this technique can be appro- priate for automation purposes, never do this for interactive use. Instead, use the SSH agent, which provides the same benefits with much greater security. Don’t use unencrypted keys for interactive SSH!  On the other hand, noninteractive, unattended programs such as cron jobs or batch scripts may also benefit from not having a password or passphrase. In this case, the different techniques raise some complex issues, and we discuss their relative merits and security issues later. [11.1]  2.7 Miscellaneous Clients Several other clients are included in addition to ssh and scp:    sftp,  an ftp-like client   slogin, a link to ssh, analogous to the rlogin program  sftp  2.7.1 The scp command is convenient and useful, but many users are already familiar with FTP  File Transfer Protocol , a more widely used technique for transferring files on the Internet.* sftp is a separate file-transfer tool layered on top of SSH. The OpenSSH sftp can run over either SSH-1 or SSH-2, whereas the Tectia version runs over SSH-2 only due to implementation details.  sftp has several advantages:    It is secure, using an SSH-protected channel for data transfer.   Multiple commands for file copying and manipulation can be invoked within a  single sftp session, whereas scp opens a new session each time it is invoked.    It can be scripted using the familiar ftp command language.   In other software applications that run an FTP client in the background, you can try substituting sftp, thus securing the file transfers of that application. You might need to run an agent, however, since programs that normally invoke ftp might not recognize the sftp passphrase prompt, or they might expect you to have suppressed FTP’s password prompt  using a .netrc file, for example .  * Due to the nature of the FTP protocol, FTP clients are difficult to secure using SSH port forwarding. It is  possible, however. [11.2]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  2.7 Miscellaneous Clients    33   Anyone familiar with FTP will feel right at home with sftp, but sftp has some addi- tional features of note:    Command-line editing using GNU Emacs-like keystrokes  Control-B for back-  ward character, Control-E for end of line, and so forth .*    Wildcards for matching filenames. OpenSSH uses the same “globbing” syntax that is supported by most common shells, while Tectia uses an extended regular expression syntax described in Appendix B.    Several useful command-line options:  –b filename  OpenSSH  –B filename  Tectia   Read commands from the given file instead of the terminal.  –S path  –v  Locate the ssh program using the given path.  Print verbose messages as the program runs.  –V  OpenSSH   Print the program version number and exit.  In addition, many of the command-line options for ssh can also be used for sftp.  The OpenSSH version of sftp supports only the binary transfer mode of standard FTP, in which files are transferred without modification. Tectia’s sftp also supports ASCII transfer mode, which translates end-of-line characters between systems that might use different conventions, e.g., carriage return plus newline for Windows, newline  only  for Unix, or carriage return  only  for Macintosh.  slogin  2.7.2 slogin is an alternative name for ssh, just as rlogin is a synonym for rsh. On Linux sys- tems, slogin is simply a symbolic link to ssh. Note that the slogin link is found in OpenSSH but not Tectia. We recommend using just ssh for consistency: it’s found in all these implementations and is shorter to type.  Summary  2.8 From the user’s point of view, SSH consists of several client programs and some con- figuration files. The most commonly used clients are ssh for remote login, and scp and sftp for file transfer. Authentication to the remote host can be accomplished  * OpenSSH 4.0 and higher.  34    Chapter 2: Basic Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Passwords are more immediately and easily used, but public-key authentication is more flexible and secure. The ssh-keygen, ssh-agent, and ssh-add programs generate and manage SSH keys.

In this chapter, we move firmly onto technical ground and explain the inner work- ings of SSH. Let’s roll up our sleeves and dive into the bits and bytes.  This chapter is written for system administrators, network administrators, and secu- rity professionals. Our goal is to teach you enough about SSH to make an intelligent, technically sound decision about using it. Mostly, we deal with SSH-2 as the current and recommended SSH protocol; our treatment of the old and deprecated SSH-1 is limited to a summary of its differences and limitations. When we refer to “the SSH protocol,” we mean SSH-2. Of course, the ultimate references on SSH are the protocol standards and the source code of an implementation. We don’t completely analyze the protocols or recapitu- late every step taken by the software. Rather, we summarize them to provide a solid, technical overview of their operation. If you need more specifics, you should refer to the standards documents. The SSH Version 2 protocol is in draft status on the IETF standards track; it is available at:  http:  www.ietf.org   The older SSH-1 protocol is called Version 1.5 and is documented in a file named RFC included in the source package of the now-obsolete SSH1.  Overview of Features  3.1 The major features and guarantees of the SSH protocol are:    Privacy of your data, via strong encryption   Integrity of communications, guaranteeing they haven’t been altered   Authentication, i.e., proof of identity of senders and receivers   Authorization, i.e., access control to accounts   Forwarding or tunneling to encrypt other TCP IP-based sessions  36  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Privacy  Encryption   3.1.1 Privacy means protecting data from disclosure. Typical computer networks don’t guarantee privacy; anyone with access to the network hardware, or to hosts con- nected to the network, may be able to read  or sniff   all data passing over the net- work. Although modern switched networks have reduced this problem in local area networks, it is still a serious issue; passwords are easily stolen by such sniffing attacks.  SSH provides privacy by encrypting data that passes over the network. This end-to- end encryption is based on random keys that are securely negotiated for that session and then destroyed when the session is over. SSH supports a variety of encryption algorithms for session data, including such standard ciphers as AES, ARCFOUR, Blowfish, Twofish, IDEA, DES, and triple-DES  3DES .  Integrity  3.1.2 Integrity means assuring that data transmitted from one end of a network connec- tion arrives unaltered on the other end. The underlying transport of SSH, TCP IP, does have integrity checking to detect alteration due to network problems  electrical noise, lost packets due to excessive traffic, etc. . Nevertheless, these methods are ineffective against deliberate tampering and can be fooled by a clever attacker. Even though SSH encrypts the data stream so that an attacker can’t easily change selected parts to achieve a specific result, TCP IP’s integrity checking alone can’t prevent, say, an attacker’s deliberate injection of garbage into your session.  A more complex example is a replay attack. Imagine that Attila the Attacker is moni- toring your SSH session and also simultaneously watching over your shoulder  either physically, or by monitoring your keystrokes at your terminal . In the course of your work, Attila sees you type the command rm -rf * within a small directory. He can’t read the encrypted SSH session data, of course, but he could correlate a burst of activity on that connection with your typing the command, and capture the packets containing the encrypted version of your command. Later, when you’re working in your home directory, Attila inserts the captured bits into your SSH session, and your terminal mysteriously erases all your files!  Attila’s replay attack succeeds because the packets he inserted are valid; he could not have produced them himself  due to the encryption , but he can copy and replay them later. TCP IP’s integrity check is performed only on a per-packet basis, so it can’t detect Attila’s attack. Clearly, the integrity check must apply to the data stream as a whole, ensuring that the bits arrive as they were sent: in order and with no duplication.  The SSH protocol uses cryptographic integrity checking, which verifies both that transmitted data hasn’t been altered and that it truly comes from the other end of the connection. It uses keyed hash algorithms based on MD5 and SHA-1 for this pur- pose: well-known, widely trusted algorithms.

Suppose I claim to be Richard Silverman, and you want to authenticate that claim. If not much is at stake, you might just take my word for it. If you’re a little concerned, you might ask for my driver’s license or other photo ID. If you’re a bank officer deciding whether to open a safe-deposit box for me, you might also require that I possess a physical key, and so on. It all depends on how sure you want to be. The arsenal of high-tech authentica- tion techniques is growing constantly and includes DNA-testing microchips, retina and hand scanners, and voice-print analyzers.  Every SSH connection involves two authentications: the client verifies the identity of the SSH server  server authentication , and the server verifies the identity of the user requesting access  user authentication . Server authentication ensures that the SSH server is genuine, not an impostor, guarding against an attacker’s redirecting your network connection to a different machine. Server authentication also protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, wherein the attacker sits invisibly between you and the server, pretending to be the client on one side and the server on the other, fooling both sides and reading all your traffic in the process!  User authentication is traditionally done with passwords, which unfortunately are a weak authentication scheme. To prove your identity you have to reveal the pass- word, exposing it to possible theft. Additionally, in order to remember a password, people are likely to keep it short and meaningful, which makes the password easier for third parties to guess. For longer passwords, some people choose words or sen- tences in their native languages, and these passwords are likely to be crackable. From the standpoint of information theory, grammatical sentences contain little real infor- mation  technically known as entropy : generally less than two bits per character in English text, far less than the 8–16 bits per character found in computer encodings.  SSH supports authentication by password, encrypting the password as it travels over the network. This is a vast improvement over other common remote-access proto- cols  Telnet, FTP  which generally send your password in the clear  i.e., unen- crypted  over the network, where anyone with sufficient network access can steal it! Nevertheless, it’s still only simple password authentication, so SSH provides other stronger and more manageable mechanisms: per-user public-key signatures, and an improved rlogin-style authentication with host identity verified by public key. In addition, various SSH implementations support some other systems, including Ker- beros, RSA Security’s SecurID tokens, S Key one-time passwords, and the Pluggable Authentication Modules  PAM  system. An SSH client and server negotiate to deter- mine which authentication mechanism to use, based on their configurations, and a server can even require multiple forms of authentication.  38    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Authorization  3.1.4 Authorization means deciding what someone may or may not do. It occurs after authentication, since you can’t grant someone privileges until you know who she is. SSH servers have various ways of restricting clients’ actions. Access to interactive login sessions, TCP port and X Window forwarding, key agent forwarding, etc., can all be controlled, though not all these features are available in all SSH implementa- tions, and they aren’t always as general or flexible as you might want. Authorization may be controlled at a serverwide level  e.g., the  etc ssh sshd_config file for OpenSSH , or per account, depending on the authentication method used  e.g., each user’s files ~ .ssh authorized_keys, ~ .ssh2 authorization, ~ .shosts, ~ .k5login, etc. .  Forwarding   Tunneling   3.1.5 Forwarding or tunneling means encapsulating another TCP-based service, such as Telnet or IMAP, within an SSH session. This brings the security benefits of SSH  pri- vacy, integrity, authentication, authorization  to other TCP-based services. For example, an ordinary Telnet connection transmits your username, password, and the rest of your login session in the clear. By forwarding telnet through SSH, all of this data is automatically encrypted and integrity-checked, and you may authenticate using SSH credentials.  SSH supports three types of forwarding:  TCP port forwarding  Secures any TCP-based service [9.2]  X forwarding  Agent forwarding  Secures the X11 protocol  i.e., X Windows  [9.4]  Permits SSH clients to use SSH private keys held on remote machines [6.3.5]  From these basic facilities, some SSH products build more complex services, such as SOCKS proxies and special-purpose forwarders that can handle difficult protocols like FTP.  A Cryptography Primer  3.2 We’ve covered the basic properties of SSH. Now we focus on cryptography, intro- ducing important terms and ideas regarding the technology in general. There are many good references on cryptographic theory and practice, and we make no attempt here to be comprehensive.  For more detailed information, check out Bruce Schneier’s excellent book, Applied Cryptography, published by John Wiley & Sons.  We introduce encryption and decryption, plaintext and ciphertext, keys, secret-key and public-key cryptography, and hash functions, both in general and as they apply to SSH.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.2 A Cryptography Primer    39   Encryption is the process of scrambling data so that it can’t be read by unauthorized parties. An encryption algorithm  or cipher  is a particular method of performing the scrambling; examples of currently popular encryption algorithms are RSA, AES, DSA, and Blowfish. The original, readable data is called the plaintext, or data “in the clear,” while the encrypted version is called the corresponding ciphertext.  The goal of an encryption algorithm is to convert plaintext to ciphertext. To do this, you pass two inputs to the encryption algorithm: the plaintext itself, and a key, a string that is typically a secret known only to you. From these inputs, the algorithm produces the ciphertext. An encryption algorithm is considered secure if it is infeasi- ble for anyone to read  or decrypt  the encrypted ciphertext without the key. An attempt to decrypt data without its key is called cryptanalysis.  How Secure Is Secure?  3.2.1 It’s important to understand the word “infeasible” in the previous paragraph. Today’s most popular and secure ciphers are vulnerable to brute-force attacks: if you try every possible key, you eventually succeed in decryption. However, when the number of possible keys is large, a brute-force search requires a great deal of time and computing power. Based on the state of the art in computer hardware and algo- rithms, it is possible to pick sufficiently large key sizes to render brute-force key- search unreasonable for your adversary. What counts as infeasible, though, depend- ing on how valuable the data is, how long it must stay secure, and how motivated and well-funded your adversary is. Keeping something secret from your rival startup for a few days is one thing; keeping it secret from a major world government for 10 years is quite another.  Of course, for all this to make sense, you must be convinced that brute force is the only way to attack your cipher. Encryption algorithms have structure and are suscep- tible to mathematical analysis. Over the years, many ciphers previously thought secure have fallen to advances in cryptanalysis. It isn’t currently possible to prove a practical cipher secure. Rather, a cipher acquires respectability through intensive study by mathematicians and cryptographers. If a new cipher exhibits good design principles, and well-known researchers study it for some time and fail to find a prac- tical, faster method of breaking it than brute force, then people will consider it secure.*  * In his pioneering works on information theory and encryption, the mathematician Claude Shannon defined a model for cipher security and showed there is a cipher that is perfectly secure under that model: the so- called one-time pad. It is perfectly secure: the encrypted data gives an attacker no information whatsoever about the possible plaintext. The ciphertext literally can decrypt to any plaintext at all with equal likelihood. The problem with the one-time pad is that it is cumbersome and fragile. It requires that keys be as large as the messages they protect, be generated perfectly randomly, and never be reused. If any of these require- ments are violated, the one-time pad becomes extremely insecure. The ciphers in common use today aren’t perfectly secure in Shannon’s sense, but for the best of them, brute-force attacks are infeasible.  40    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Public- and Secret-Key Cryptography  3.2.2 Encryption algorithms as described so far are called symmetric or secret-key ciphers; the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting. Examples are Blowfish, AES, 3DES, and RC4. Such a cipher immediately introduces the key-distribution prob- lem: how do you get the key to your intended recipient? If you can meet in person every once in a while and exchange a list of keys, that’s all well and good, but for dynamic communication over computer networks, this doesn’t work.  Public-key, or asymmetric, cryptography replaces the single key with a pair of related keys: public and private. They are related in a mathematically clever way: data encrypted with one key may be decrypted only with the other member of the pair, and it is infeasible to derive the private key from the public one. You keep your pri- vate key, well, private, and give the public key to anyone who wants it, without wor- rying about disclosure. Ideally, you publish it in a directory next to your name, like a telephone book. When someone wants to send you a secret message, they encrypt it with your public key. Other people may have your public key, but that won’t allow them to decrypt the message; only you can do that with the corresponding private key. Public-key cryptography goes a long way toward solving the key-distribution problem.*  Public-key methods are also the basis for digital signatures: extra infor- mation attached to a digital document to provide evidence that a par- ticular person has seen and agreed to it, much as a pen-and-ink signature does with a paper document. Any asymmetric cipher  RSA, ElGamal, Elliptic Curve, etc.  may be used for digital signatures, though the reverse isn’t true. For instance, the DSA algorithm is a sig- nature-only public-key scheme and is not intended to be used for encryption.  That’s the idea, anyway, although it’s easy to use a gen- eral DSA implementation for both RSA and ElGamal encryption. That was not the intent, however.   Secret- and public-key encryption algorithms differ in another way: performance. All common public-key algorithms are enormously slower than secret-key ciphers—by orders of magnitude. It is simply infeasible to encrypt large quantities of data using a public-key cipher. For this reason, modern data encryption uses both methods together. Suppose you want to send some data securely to your friend Bob Bitflip- per. Here’s what a modern encryption program does:  1. Generate a random key, called the bulk key, for a fast, secret-key algorithm like  3DES  a.k.a. the bulk cipher .  2. Encrypt the plaintext with the bulk key.  * There is still the issue of reliably determining whose public key is whose; but that gets into public-key infra-  structure, or PKI systems, and is a broader topic.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.2 A Cryptography Primer    41   3. Secure the bulk key by encrypting it with Bob Bitflipper’s public key, so only Bob can decrypt it. Since secret keys are small  a few hundred bits long at most , the speed of the public-key algorithm isn’t an issue.  To reverse the operation, Bob’s decryption program first decrypts the bulk key, and then uses it to decrypt the ciphertext. This method yields the advantages of both kinds of encryption technology, and in fact, SSH uses this technique. User data crossing an SSH connection is encrypted using a fast secret-key cipher, the key for which is shared between the client and server using public-key methods.  Hash Functions  3.2.3 In cryptography  and elsewhere in computing and network technology , it is often useful to know if some collection of data has changed. Of course, one can just send along  or keep around  the original data for comparison, but that can be prohibi- tively expensive both in time and storage. The common tool addressing this need is called a hash function. Hash functions are used by SSH-1 for integrity checking  and have various other uses in cryptography we won’t discuss here .  A hash function is simply a mapping from a larger set of data values to a smaller set. For instance, a hash function H might take an input bit string of any length up to 50,000 bits, and uniformly produce a 128-bit output. The idea is that when sending a message m to Alice, I also send along the hash value H m . Alice computes H m  independently and compares it to the H m  value I sent; if they differ, she concludes that the message was modified in transit.  This simple technique can’t be completely effective. Since the range of the hash func- tion is strictly smaller than its domain, many different messages have the same hash value. To be useful, H must have the property that the kinds of alterations expected to happen to the messages in transit, must be overwhelmingly likely to cause a change in the message hash. Put another way: given a message m and a typical changed message m', it must be extremely unlikely that H m  = H m' .  Thus, a hash function must be tailored to its intended use. One common use is in networking: datagrams transmitted over a network frequently include a message hash that detects transmission errors due to hardware failure or software bugs. Another use is in cryptography, to implement digital signatures. Signing a large amount of data is prohibitively expensive, since it involves slow public-key opera- tions as well as shipping along a complete encrypted copy of the data. What is actu- ally done is to first hash the document, producing a small hash value, and then sign that, sending the signed hash along instead. A verifier independently computes the hash, then decrypts the signature using the appropriate public key, and compares them. If they are the same, he concludes  with high probability  that the signature is valid, and that the data hasn’t changed since the private-key holder signed it.  42    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   These two uses, however, have different requirements, and a hash function suitable for detecting transmission errors due to line noise might be ineffective at detecting deliberate alterations introduced by a human attacker! A cryptographic hash func- tion must make it computationally infeasible to find two different messages having the same hash or to find a message having a particular fixed hash. Such a function is said to be collision-resistant  or collision-proof, though that’s a bit misleading , and pre-image-resistant. The Cyclic Redundancy Check  CRC  hash commonly used to detect accidental data changes  e.g., in Ethernet frame transmissions  is an example of a noncollision-resistant hash. It is easy to find CRC-32 hash collisions, and a well- known attack on SSH-1 is based on this fact. [3.5] Examples of cryptographically strong hash functions are MD5 and SHA-1.  The Architecture of an SSH System  3.3 SSH has about a dozen distinct, interacting components that produce the features we’ve covered. [3.1] Figure 3-1 illustrates the major components and their relation- ships to one another.

SSH architecture  By “component” we don’t necessarily mean “program”: SSH also has keys, sessions, and other fun things. In this section we provide a brief overview of all the compo- nents, so you can begin to get the big picture of SSH: Server  A program that allows incoming SSH connections to a machine, handling authentication, authorization, and so forth. In most Unix SSH implementations, the server is sshd.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.3 The Architecture of an SSH System   43   Client  Session  Key  A program that connects to SSH servers and makes requests, such as “log me in” or “copy this file.” In OpenSSH and Tectia, the major clients are ssh, scp, and sftp.  An ongoing connection between a client and a server. It begins after the client successfully authenticates to a server and ends when the connection terminates. Sessions may be interactive or batch.  A relatively small amount of data, generally from tens of to 1,000 or 2,000 bits, used as a parameter to cryptographic algorithms such as encryption or message authentication. The key binds the algorithm operation in some way to the key holder: in encryption, it ensures that only someone else holding that key  or a related one  can decrypt the message; in authentication, it allows you to verify later that the key holder actually signed the message. There are two kinds of keys: symmetric or secret key, and asymmetric or public key. [3.2.2] An asym- metric key has two parts: the public and private components. SSH has several types of keys, as summarized in Table 3-1.  Table 3-1. Keys, keys, keys  Name User key Host key Session key  Lifetime Persistent Persistent One session  Created by User Administrator Client  and server   Type Public Public Secret  Purpose Identify a user to the server Identify a server machine Protect communications  User key  Host key  Session key  A persistent, asymmetric key used by clients as proof of a user’s identity.  A single user may have many keys identities.   A persistent, asymmetric key used by a server as proof of its identity, as well as by a client when proving its host’s identity as part of hostbased authenti- cation. [3.4.3.6] If a machine runs a single SSH server, the host key also uniquely identifies the machine.  If a machine is running multiple SSH serv- ers, each may have a different host key, or they may share.   A randomly generated, symmetric key for encrypting the communication between an SSH client and server. It is shared by the two parties in a secure manner during the SSH connection setup so that an eavesdropper can’t dis- cover it. Both sides then have the session key, which they use to encrypt their communications. When the SSH session ends, the key is destroyed.  44    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   An SSH connection has several session keys: each direction  server to client, and client to server  has keys for encryption and others for integrity checking. In our discussions we treat all the session keys as a unit and speak of “the session key” for convenience; they are all derived from a single master secret, anyway. If the context requires it, we identify the individual key we mean.  Key generator  Known-hosts database  A program that creates persistent keys  user keys and host keys  for SSH. OpenSSH and Tectia have the program ssh-keygen.  A collection of host keys. Clients and servers refer to this database to authenti- cate one another.  A program that caches user keys in memory, so users needn’t keep retyping their passphrases. The agent responds to requests for key-related operations, such as signing an authenticator, but it doesn’t disclose the keys themselves. It is a con- venience feature. OpenSSH and Tectia have the agent ssh-agent, and the pro- gram ssh-add loads and unloads the key cache.  Agent  Signer  A program that signs hostbased authentication packets. We explain this in our discussion of hostbased authentication. [3.4.3.6]  Random seed  Configuration file  A pool of random data used by SSH components to initialize software pseudo- random number generators.  A collection of settings to tailor the behavior of an SSH client or server.  Not all these components are required in an implementation of SSH. Certainly serv- ers, clients, and keys are mandatory, but many implementations don’t have an agent, and some don’t even include a key generator.  Inside SSH-2  3.4 The SSH protocol has two major, incompatible versions, called Version 1* and Ver- sion 2. [1.5] We refer to these as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The SSH-1 protocol is now a relic; it is less flexible than SSH-2, has unfixable security weaknesses, and has been depre- cated for years. Its implementations see no real development aside from bug fixes, and the default protocol for most SSH software has been SSH-2 for some time now. In this chapter, as we describe “the SSH protocol,” we are talking about SSH-2. We limit our  * SSH Version 1 went through several revisions, the most popular known as Versions 1.3 and 1.5.

The SSH protocol is actually divided into four major pieces, formally described as four separate protocols in different IETF documents, and in principle independent of one another. In practice, they are layered together to provide the set of services most users associate with SSH as a whole. These are:    SSH Transport Layer Protocol  SSH-TRANS    SSH Authentication Protocol  SSH-AUTH    SSH Connection Protocol  SSH-CONN    SSH File Transfer Protocol  SSH-SFTP   There are other documents that describe other aspects of, or extensions to, the pro- tocols, but the preceding ones represent the core of SSH. As of this writing, these documents are still “Internet-Drafts,” but after much effort by the IETF SECSH working group, they have been submitted to the IESG for consideration as proposed standards and may soon be published as Internet RFCs.  Figure 3-2 outlines the division of labor between these protocols, and how they relate to each other, application programs, and the network. Elements in italics are proto- col extensions defined in separate Internet-Draft documents, which have attained fairly widespread use.  application software  e.g., ssh, sshd, scp, sftp, sftp-server   SSH Authentication Protocol [SSH-AUTH]  SSH Connection Protocol [SSH-CONN]  SSH File Transfer Protocol [SSH-SFTP]  remote filesystem access file transfer  channel multiplexing pseudo-terminals flow control signal propagation remote program execution authentication agent forwarding TCP port and X forwarding terminal handling subsystems  client authentication     publickey     hostbased     password     gssapi     gssapi-with-mic     external-keyx     keyboard-interactive  algorithm negotiation session key exchange session ID server authentication privacy integrity data compression  SSH Transport Protocol [SSH-TRANS]  TCP  or other transparent, reliable, duplex byte-oriented connection   Figure 3-2. SSH-2 protocol family  46    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   SSH is designed to be modular and extensible. All of the core protocols define abstract services they provide and requirements they must meet, but allow multiple mechanisms for doing so, as well as a way of easily adding new mechanisms. All the critical parameters of an SSH connection are negotiable, including the methods and algorithms used in:    Session key exchange   Server authentication   Data privacy and integrity   User authentication   Data compression  Client and server negotiate the use of a common set of methods, allowing broad interoperability among different implementations. In most categories, the protocol defines at least one required method, to further promote interoperability. Note that this only means a conforming implementation is required to support the method in its code; any particular method may in fact be turned off by the administrator in a particular environment. So, the fact that public-key authentication is required by SSH-AUTH doesn’t mean it’s always available to clients from any particular running SSH server; it merely means it must be available and could be turned on, if need be.  Protocol Summary  3.4.1 SSH-TRANS is the fundamental building block, providing the initial connection, record protocol, server authentication, and basic encryption and integrity services. After establishing an SSH-TRANS connection, the client has a single, secure, full- duplex byte stream to an authenticated peer.  Next, the client can use SSH-AUTH over the SSH-TRANS connection to authenti- cate itself to the server. SSH-AUTH defines a framework within which multiple authentication mechanisms may be used, fixing such things as the format and order of authentication requests, conditions for success or failure, and how a client learns the available methods. There may be any number of actual methods implemented, and the protocol allows arbitrary exchanges as part of any particular mechanism so that protocol extensions are easily defined to incorporate any desired authentication method in the future. SSH-AUTH requires only one method: public key with the DSS algorithm. It further defines two more methods: password and hostbased. A number of other methods have been defined in various Internet-Drafts, and some of them have gained wide acceptance.  After authentication, SSH clients invoke the SSH-CONN protocol, which provides a variety of richer services over the single pipe provided by SSH-TRANS. This includes everything needed to support multiple interactive and noninteractive sessions: multi- plexing several streams  or channels  over the underlying connection; managing X,  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Finally, an application may use SSH-SFTP over an SSH-CONN channel to provide file-transfer and remote filesystem manipulation functions.  It’s important to understand that the arrangement, layering, and sequencing of these protocols is a matter of convention or need, not design; although they are typically used in a particular order, other arrangements are possible. For instance, note that SSH-CONN is not layered on top of SSH-AUTH; they are both at the same level above SSH-TRANS. Typically, an SSH server requires authentication via SSH-AUTH before allowing the client to invoke SSH-CONN—and also typically, clients want to use SSH-CONN in order to obtain the usual SSH services  remote terminal, agent forwarding, etc. . However, this need not be the case. A specialized SSH server for a particular, limited purpose might not require authentication, and hence could allow a client to invoke an application service  SSH-CONN, or perhaps some other locally defined service  immediately after establishing an SSH-TRANS connection. An anon- ymous SFTP server might be implemented this way, for example. However, such nonstandard protocol arrangements are probably seen only in a closed environment with custom client server software. Since most SFTP clients in the world expect to do SSH-AUTH, they probably won’t interoperate with such a server. An anonymous SFTP server for general use would use SSH-AUTH in the usual fashion and simply report immediate success for any attempted client authentication.  That said, these protocols were conceived as a group and rely on each other in prac- tice. For instance, SSH-SFTP on its own provides no security whatsoever; it is merely a language for conducting remote-filing operations. It’s assumed to be run over a secure transport if security is needed, such as an SSH session. However, using the sftp -S option of OpenSSH and Tectia, for example, you could connect the sftp client to an sftp-server running on another host using some other method: over a serial line, or some other secure network protocol...or rsh if you want to be perverse. Similarly, SSH-AUTH mechanisms rely on a secure underlying transport to varying degrees. The most obvious is the “password” mechanism, which simply sends the password in plaintext over the transport as part of an authentication request. Obviously, that mechanism would be disastrous over an insecure transport.  Another important point is that the SSH protocol deals only with communication “on-the-wire”—that is, its formats and conventions apply only to data being exchanged dynamically between the SSH client and server. It says nothing at all, for instance, about:  48    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Formats for storing keys on disk   User authorization  e.g., ~ .ssh authorized_keys    Key agents or agent forwarding  ...and many other things that people typically think of as part of SSH. These facets are implementation-dependent: they are not specified by the standard, and hence may be done differently depending on what software you’re using. And in fact they do differ: OpenSSH and Tectia use different file formats for keys. Even if you convert one to the other, you’ll find that OpenSSH keys belong in ~ .ssh authorized_keys, whereas each Tectia key goes in its own file, listed by reference in yet another file, ~ .ssh2  authorization. And although both products sport a private-key agent—with the same name even, ssh-agent—they are incompatible.  Now that we have an overview of the major components of SSH, let’s dive in and examine each of these protocols in detail. To give structure and concreteness to an otherwise abstract description of the protocols, we frame our discussion by follow- ing a particular SSH connection from beginning to end. We follow the thread of debugging messages produced by ssh -vv, explaining the significance of the various messages and turning aside now and then to describe the protocol phases occurring at that point.  Since this –vv level of verbosity produces quite a few messages not relevant to our protocol discussion, we omit some for the sake of clarity.  3.4.2  SSH Transport Layer Protocol  SSH-TRANS   Connection  3.4.2.1 We begin by running an SSH client in verbose mode, requesting a connection to host.foo.net:  $ ssh -vv host.foo.net OpenSSH_3.6.1p1+CAN-2003-0693, SSH protocols 1.5 2.0, OpenSSL 0x0090702f debug1: Reading configuration data  Users res .ssh config debug1: Applying options for com debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Reading configuration data  etc ssh ssh_config debug1: Connecting to host.foo.net [10.1.1.1] port 22. debug1: Connection established.  The client is a version of OpenSSH running on a Macintosh. It reads its configura- tion files, then makes a TCP connection to the remote side, which succeeds.

All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    49   Protocol version selection  3.4.2.2 As soon as the server accepts the connection, the SSH protocol begins. The server announces its protocol version using a text string:  debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version 4.1.0.34 SSH Secure Shell  You can see this string yourself by simply connecting to the server socket, e.g., with telnet:  $ telnet host.foo.net 22 Trying 10.1.1.1... Connected to host.foo.net Escape character is '^]'. SSH-2.0-4.1.0.34 SSH Secure Shell ^] telnet> quit Connection closed.  The format of the announcement is:  SSH- -   In this case, the server implements the SSH-2 protocol, and the software version is 4.1.0.34 of SSH Secure Shell from SSH Communications Security. Although the comment field can contain anything at all, SSH servers commonly put their product name and version there. This is useful, as clients often recognize specific servers in order to work around known bugs or incompatibilities. Some people don’t like this practice on security grounds, and try to remove or change the comment. Be aware that if you do, you may cause more trouble than it’s worth, since previously work- ing SSH sessions may suddenly start failing if they had relied on such workarounds.  The protocol version number “1.99” has special significance: it means the server sup- ports both SSH-1 and SSH-2, and the client may choose either one.  Next, OpenSSH parses the comment:  debug1: no match: 4.1.0.34 SSH Secure Shell debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.6.1p1+CAN-2003-0693  but does not find a match in its list of known problems to work around. It elects to proceed with SSH-2  the only choice in this case , and sends its own version string to the server, in the same format. If the client and server agree that their versions are compatible, the connection process continues; otherwise, either party may decide to terminate the connection.  At this point, if the connection proceeds, both sides switch to a nontextual, record- oriented protocol for further communication, which is the basis of SSH transport. This is often referred to as the SSH binary packet protocol, and is defined in SSH- TRANS.  50    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Parameter negotiation  3.4.2.3 Having established a connection and agreed on a protocol version, the first real func- tion of SSH-TRANS is to arrange for the basic security properties of SSH:    Privacy  encryption    Integrity  nonmodifiability and origin assurance    Server authentication  man-in-the-middle and spoofing resistance    Compression  not a security property per se, but included in this negotiation   But first, the two sides must agree on session parameters, including the methods to achieve these properties. The whole process happens in the protocol phase called the key exchange, even though the first part also negotiates some parameters unrelated to the key exchange per se.  debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received  The client sends its KEXINIT  “key exchange initialization”  message, and receives one from the server. Here are the choices it gives to the server:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: gss-group1-sha1-toWM5Slw5Ew8Mqkay+al2g==,                  gss-group1-sha1-A vxljAEU54gt9a48EiANQ==,                  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,                  diffie-hellman-group1-sha1  These are the key exchange algorithms the client supports, which are:  diffie-hellman-group1-sha1  This algorithm is defined and required by SSH-TRANS; this specifies the well- known Diffie-Hellman procedure for key agreement, together with specific parameters  Oakley Group 2 [RFC-2409] and the SHA-1 hash algorithm .  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1  Similar, but allows the client to choose from a list of group parameters, address- ing concerns about possible attacks based on a fixed group; defined in the IETF draft document “secsh-dh-group-exchange.”* gss-group1-sha1-toWM5Slw5Ew8Mqkay+al2g== gss-group1-sha1-A vxljAEU54gt9a48EiANQ==  These odd-looking names are partially encoded in Base64—they represent two variants of a Kerberos-authenticated Diffie-Hellman exchange as defined in IETF draft “secsh-gsskeyex.” These are useful where a Kerberos infrastructure is avail- able, providing automatic and flexible server authentication without maintain- ing separate SSH host keys and known-hosts files. The Kerberos authentication  * A group is a mathematical abstraction relevant to the Diffie-Hellman procedure; see a reference on group the-  ory, number theory, or abstract algebra if you’re curious.

Say that five times fast.  In terms of abstract requirements, an SSH key exchange algorithm has two outputs:    A shared secret, K   An “exchange hash,” H  K is the master secret for the session: SSH-TRANS defines a method for deriving from secret K the various keys and other cryptographic parameters needed for specific encryption and integrity algorithms used in the SSH connection. The exchange hash H does not have to be secret, although it should not be divulged unnecessarily. It should be unique to each session, and computed in such a way that neither side can force a particular value of hash H. We’ll see the significance of that later.  The key exchange should also perform server authentication, in order to guard against spoofing and man-in-the-middle  MITM  attacks. There is an inherent asym- metry in the SSH client server relationship: the server accepts connections from as- yet unknown parties, whereas a client always has a particular server as the target of its connection. The server may demand secret information as part of user authentica- tion  e.g., password . The client is the first party to rely on the identity of the other side, and hence server authentication comes first. Without server authentication, an attacker might redirect the client’s TCP connection to a host of his choice  perhaps by subverting the DNS or network routing  and trick the user into logging into the wrong host; this is called spoofing. Or, he might interpose himself between the client and the  legitimate  server, executing the SSH protocol as server on one side and cli- ent on the other, passing messages back and forth and reading all the traffic! This is a man-in-the-middle attack.  The key exchange phase of SSH-TRANS may be repeated later in a connection, in order to replace an aging master secret or re-authenticate the server. In fact, the draft recommends that a connection be re-keyed after each gigabyte of transmitted data or after each hour of connection time, whichever comes sooner. However, the hash out- put H of the very first key exchange is used as the “session identifier” for this SSH connection; we’ll see its use later.  Next, the client offers a choice of SSH host key types it can accept:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss,null  In this case, it offers RSA, DSA, and “null,” for no key at all. It includes “null” because of its support of Kerberos for host authentication; if a Kerberos key exchange is used, no SSH-specific host key is needed for server authentication.  After that, the client lists the bulk data encryption ciphers it supports:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,arcfour,                  aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc,rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se  52    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The selected cipher is used for privacy of data flowing over the connection. Bulk data is never enciphered directly with public-key methods such as RSA or DSA because they are far too slow. Instead, we use a symmetric cipher such as those listed, pro- tecting the session key for that cipher with public-key methods if appropriate. The names here indicate particular algorithms and associated cryptographic parameters; for instance, aes128-cbc refers to the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm, with a 128-bit key in cipher-block-chaining mode.  Note the use of a private algorithm name as well: rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se. This email-address-like syntax is defined in the SSH Architecture draft  “secsh- architecture” , and allows any individuals or organizations to define and use their own algorithms or other SSH protocol identifiers without going through the IETF to have them approved. Identifiers that don’t contain an @ sign are global and must be centrally registered.  The draft also defines the “none” cipher, meaning no encryption is to be applied. While there are legitimate reasons for wanting such a connection  including debug- ging! , some SSH implementations do not support it, at least in their default configu- ration. Often, recompiling the software from source with different flags, or hacking the code itself, is needed to turn on support for “none” encryption.* The reason is that it’s deemed just too dangerous. If a user can easily turn off encryption, so can an attacker who gains access to a user’s account, even briefly. Imagine surreptitiously adding this to an OpenSSH user’s client configuration file, ~ .ssh config:   OpenSSH Host *  Ciphers none  or simply replacing the ssh program on a compromised machine with one that uses the “none” cipher, and issues no warnings about it. Bingo! All the user’s SSH ses- sions become transparent, until he notices the change  if ever . If the client doesn’t support “none,” then this simple config file hack won’t work; if the server doesn’t, then the client-side Trojan horse won’t work, either.  Next, the client presents its list of available integrity algorithms:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-ripemd160,                  hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96  The integrity algorithm is applied to each message sent by the SSH record protocol, together with a sequence number and session key, to produce a message authentica- tion code  MAC  appended to each message. The receiver can use the MAC and its own copy of the session key to verify that the message has not been altered in transit,  * OpenSSH has no support for the “none” cipher; it can’t even be enabled at compile time. In contrast, Tectia fully supports the “none” cipher, but it is not enabled by default; it needs to be explicitly included using the Ciphers keyword. [5.3.5]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    53   is not a replay, and came from the other holder of the session key; these are the mes- sage integrity properties.  SSH-TRANS defines several MAC algorithms, and requires support for one: “hmac- sha1,” a 160-bit hash using the standard keyed HMAC construction with SHA-1  see RFC-2104, “HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication” .  Finally, the client indicates which data-compression techniques it supports:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: none,zlib  The draft does not require any compression to be available  i.e., “none” is the required type . It does define “zlib”: LZ77 compression as described in RFC-1950 and in RFC-1951. Although it does not appear here, SSH speakers also at this point also can negotiate a language tag for the session  as described in RFC-3066 , e.g., to allow a server to provide error messages in a language appropriate to the user.  Having sent its negotiation message, the client also receives one from the server, list- ing the various parameters it supports in the same categories:  debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: ssh-dss,x509v3-sign-rsa debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,twofish128-cbc,cast128-cbc,                  twofish-cbc, blowfish-cbc,aes192-cbc,aes256-cbc,                  twofish192-cbc,twofish256-cbc,arcfour debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: hmac-sha1,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5,hmac-md5-96 debug2: kex_parse_kexinit: none,zlib  Note that this server supports a much smaller set of key exchange algorithms: only the required one, in fact. It has two host key types to offer: plain DSS, and RSA with X.509 public-key certificate attached. It does not support a null host key since its sin- gle key exchange algorithm requires one.  Next, each side chooses a cipher integrity compression combination from the other side’s set of supported algorithms:  debug1: kex: server->client aes128-cbc hmac-md5 none debug1: kex: client->server aes128-cbc hmac-md5 none  In this case, the choices in both directions are the same; however, they need not be. The choice of these mechanisms is entirely independent, and they are independently keyed, as well. Data flowing in one direction might be encrypted with AES and com- pressed, while the return stream could be encrypted with 3DES without compression.  Key exchange and server authentication  3.4.2.4 At this point, we are ready to engage in the actual key exchange:  debug2: dh_gen_key: priv key bits set: 131 256 debug2: bits set: 510 1024 debug1: sending SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT  54    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The client chooses an exchange algorithm from the server’s advertised set; in this case, the server offers only one, and we go with it. We generate an ephemeral key as part of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, and send the initial message of the diffie- hellman-group1-sha1 exchange, simultaneously letting the server know which method we’re using, and actually starting it.  Next the client expects, and the server sends, its reply to our KEXDH_INIT message:  debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY debug1: Host 'host.foo.net' is known and matches the DSA host key. debug1: Found key in  Users res .ssh known_hosts:169 debug2: bits set: 526 1024 debug1: ssh_dss_verify: signature correct  Contained in the reply is the server’s SSH public host key, of a type we said we’d accept in the earlier parameter negotiation  DSA , along with a signature proving it holds the corresponding private key. The signature is verified, of course, but that by itself is meaningless; for all we know, the server just generated this key. The crucial step here is to check that the public key identifies the server we wanted to contact. In this case, the client finds a record associating the name foo.host.net with the key sup- plied by the server, at line 169 in the user’s OpenSSH known_hosts file.  Note that the approach used to verify the host key is entirely unspecified by the SSH protocol; it’s completely implementation-dependent. Most SSH products provide some version of the known-hosts file method used here: simple, but limiting and cumbersome for large numbers of hosts, users, or different SSH implementations. A client could do anything that makes sense to verify the host key, perhaps taking advantage of some existing secure infrastructure, for example; look it up in a trusted LDAP directory.  Of course, the problem of verifying the owner of a public key is hardly a new one; that’s what Public Key Infrastructure  PKI  systems are for, such as the X.509 stan- dard for public-key certificates. SSH-2 supports PKI, defining a number of key types which include attached certificates:  ssh-rsa ssh-dss x509v3-sign-rsa x509v3-sign-dss spki-sign-rsa spki-sign-dss pgp-sign-rsa pgp-sign-dss  Plain RSA key Plain DSS key X.509 certificates  RSA key  X.509 certificates  DSS key  SPKI certificates  RSA key  SPKI certificates  DSS key  OpenPGP certificates  RSA key  OpenPGP certificates  DSS key   Many SSH products handle only plain DSS RSA keys, but some  such as Tectia  offer PKI support as well. Recall that earlier, the server offered a key type of x509v3-sign- rsa along with plain DSS. Our OpenSSH client does not support certificates, and so selected the DSS key. However, with PKI support, the client could verify the host key  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    55   by its accompanying certificate. New hosts could be added and existing keys changed, without having to push out new known-hosts files to all clients every time—often a practical impossibility anyway, when you consider laptops, many dif- ferent SSH clients with different ways of storing host keys, etc. Instead, clients only need a single key; that of the authority issuing your host key certificates. We’ll cover PKI in more detail in a case study. [11.5]  Server authentication and antispooﬁng: some gory details  3.4.2.5 As noted earlier, we’re avoiding diving too deeply into protocol details, instead attempting a technical overview that covers the issues SSH administrators most need to understand to deploy effective systems. However, it’s worth going a little deeper here regarding the actual mechanism of server authentication, since our description begs the question. Simply saying that the server “provides a signature” to prove its identity doesn’t cut it. Here’s a naive protocol:  1. Client sends a challenge. 2. Server returns challenge signed with its host key. 3. Client verifies the signature and the server key binding and takes this as proof of  the server’s identity.  We’re being at least moderately clever here; by using a random challenge, we assure that the response can’t be replayed by an attacker, i.e., is not a reply from an earlier session. Not bad, but no cigar: this simple procedure does not prevent MITM attacks! An MITM attacker can simply pass along the challenge to the server, get the signature, and pass it back to the client. All this protocol really proves to the client is that the entity at the other end of its connection can talk to the real server, when what the client wants to verify is that entity actually is the real server. So, here’s how it’s done: instead of a random challenge, the server signs the SSH session identifier, which we described earlier. Recall that the identifier is unique to each session, and that neither side can force a particular value for it. In order to do MITM, our attacker has to execute the SSH protocol independently on two sides: once with the client, and again with the server. The identifiers for those two connections are guaranteed to be different, no matter what the attacker does. He needs to produce the client-side identifier signed by the server in order to fool the client, but all he can get is the server-side identifier; he can’t force the server to sign the wrong identifier.  Cryptographers are devious people. We like them.  3.4.2.6 Wonder security powers, activate! Back to our debug trace example: we’ve sent and received a single key-exchange mes- sage on each side now, and this key-exchange method in fact only requires the two messages. Other exchange mechanisms could take any number and form of messages, but ours is now complete. Based on the contents of these messages, both  56    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   sides compute the needed shared master secret K and exchange hash H, in such a way that an observer can’t feasibly discover them  we leave the mathematical details to your perusal of the actual draft document, if you’re that curious . Having authenti- cated the exchange using the server’s host key, we are convinced that we have shared keys with the server we really wanted to talk to, and now everything is in place to turn on security in the form of encryption and integrity checking.  Using a procedure defined in the draft, the client derives appropriate encryption and integrity keys from the master secret; the server does the same to produce matching keys:  debug2: kex_derive_keys debug2: set_newkeys: mode 1 debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug2: set_newkeys: mode 0 debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received  Both sides then send the NEWKEYS message, each which marks taking the new keys into effect in its own direction; all messages after NEWKEYS are protected using the new set of keys just negotiated. With a functioning SSH-TRANS session at hand, the client now requests the first service it wants access over the connection: user authentication.  debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent debug2: service_accept: ssh-userauth debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received  SSH Authentication Protocol  SSH-AUTH   3.4.3 Compared to SSH-TRANS, SSH-AUTH is a relatively simple affair, defined in a mere 12 pages as opposed to the 28 of the SSH-TRANS document  and that’s not count- ing various extensions! . As with SSH-TRANS and key-exchange methods, the authentication protocol defines a framework within which arbitrary authentication exchanges may take place. It then defines a small number of actual authentication mechanisms, and allows for easy extension to define others. The three defined meth- ods are password, public-key, and host-based authentication, of which only public- key is required.  The authentication request  3.4.3.1 The authentication process is driven by the client, framed by client requests and server responses. A request contains the following parts:  Username U  The authorization identity the client is claiming. For most SSH systems, this means a user account in the usual sense: for instance, in Unix, granting the right to create processes with a particular uid. However, it might have some other meaning in other contexts; its interpretation is not defined by the protocol.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    57   Service name S  The facility to which the client is requesting access, and hence implicitly the pro- tocol to be started over the SSH-TRANS connection after authentication suc- ceeds. There might be several authenticated services available, but typically there is only one: “ssh-connection,” requesting access to the various services provided via the SSH-CONN protocol: interactive login, remote command execution, file transfer, port forwarding, and all the other things users actually want to do with SSH.  Method name M, and method-specific data D  The particular authentication method being used in this request—say, “pass- word” or “publickey”—and the method-specific data convey whatever is needed to start this particular authentication exchange, e.g., an actual password to be verified by the server. As with key-exchange names in SSH-TRANS, names with “@domain” syntax may be used by anyone to implement local methods, while names without @-signs must be globally registered SSH authentication methods.  Once a particular authentication method starts, it may include any number of other message types specific to its needs. Or in the simplest case, the data carried by the initial request is enough, and the server can respond right away. In any case, after the request and some number of subsequent method-specific messages back and forth, the server issues an authentication response.  Note that, strictly speaking, calling this an “authentication request” is not quite accurate; this request actually mixes authentication and authorization. It requests verifying an authentication identity via some method, and simultaneously asks the server to check that identity’s right to access a particular account: an authorization decision. If the attempt fails, the client doesn’t know whether this was because authentication failed  e.g., it supplied the wrong password , or authentication suc- ceeded but authorization failed  e.g., the password was right but the account was disabled . A human-readable error message might make that clear, but the situations are indistinguishable as far as the protocol is concerned  in general, but individual methods may provide more information, as we will see later with the public-key method .  The authentication response  3.4.3.2 An SSH-AUTH authentication response comes in two flavors: SUCCESS and FAIL- URE  an early version of the protocol had chocolate, too, which was unfortunately abandoned . A SUCCESS message carries no other data; it simply means that authentication was successful, and the requested service has been started; further SSH-TRANS messages sent by the client should be defined within that service’s pro- tocol, and the SSH-AUTH run is over.  58    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   A FAILURE message has more structure:    A list of authentication methods that can continue   A “Partial success” flag  The name “failure” is actually a bit misleading here. If the partial success flag is false, then this message does mean the preceding authentication method has failed for some reason  e.g., a supplied password was incorrect, a mismatched public key pro- duced an incorrect signature, the requested account is locked out, etc. . If the flag is true, however, the message means that the method succeeded; however, the server requires that additional methods also succeed before granting access. Thus, the pro- tocol allows an SSH server to require multiple authentication methods—although not all for instance, while OpenSSH currently does not.*  implementations provide the feature; Tectia does,  In either case, the message also supplies the list of authentication methods the server is willing to accept next. This allows for much flexibility; if it wants, the server can completely control the authentication process by only allowing one method at any time. But it can also specify multiple methods, allowing the client to choose them in an order which makes sense for the user. For instance, given a choice, a SSH client usually first tries methods that allow automatic authentication, such as Kerberos or public key with an agent, before those that require user intervention, such as enter- ing a password or key passphrase.  3.4.3.3 Getting started: the “none” request One thing is missing from all this: if the client drives the authentication process by making requests, but the list of available authentication methods is contained in server responses, then how does the client pick a first method to try? Of course, it could always just try any method and see what happens; the worst that could hap- pen is that it fails or isn’t available, and the client gets a correct list to pick from. But that’s messy, and there’s a standard way to do it: the “none” method. The protocol reserves the method name “none,” and gives it a special meaning: if authentication is required at all, then this method must always fail. A client typically starts SSH- AUTH by sending a “none” request, expecting failure and getting back the list of available non-“none” methods to try. Of course, if the account in question does not require authentication, the server may respond with SUCCESS, immediately grant- ing access.  Here, the client, having already sent the “none” request to start with, now receives its initial list of methods to try:  debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password  * The OpenSSH team is working on multiple authentication support.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    59   If you’re debugging on the server side, you see something like this  with the OpenSSH server :  debug1: userauth-request for user res service ssh-connection method none debug1: attempt 0 failures 0 Failed none for res from 10.1.1.1 port 50459 ssh2  This message is confusing if you’re debugging some other problem, as it appears to show some mysterious failure.  The client continues, choosing public-key authentication to try first, with a DSS key stored in the SSH agent:  debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering agent key: res-dsa debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply  Public-key authentication  3.4.3.4 A public-key authentication request carries the method name “publickey” and may have different forms depending on a flag setting. One form has this method-specific payload:  The usable public-key algorithms are the same set defined in SSH-TRANS, and the format key data depends on the type; e.g., for “ssh-dss” it contains just the key, whereas for x509v3-sign-rsa it contains an X.509 public-key certificate.  With the flag set to FALSE, this message is merely an authorization test: it asks the server to check whether this key is authorized to access the desired account, without actually performing authentication. If it is, a special response message comes back; this is an example of the possible method-specific SSH-AUTH messages we men- tioned earlier. If the key is not authorized, the response is simply FAILURE.    Flag = FALSE   Algorithm name   Key data  The second form is:    Flag = TRUE   Algorithm name   Key data - signature  This actually requests authentication; the signature is computed over a set of request-specific data which includes the session ID, which binds the request to this SSH session and gives the public-key method its own measure of MITM resistance, similar to that described earlier for key exchange.  60    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The reason for providing both forms of request is that computing and verifying public-key signatures are compute-intensive tasks, which might also require interac- tion with the user  e.g., typing in a key passphrase . Hence, it makes sense to test a key first, to see whether it’s worth going to the trouble of using it.  The way a server actually authorizes a key for access to an account is outside the scope of the protocol, and can be anything at all. The usual way is to list or refer to the key in some file in the account, as with the OpenSSH ~ .ssh authorized_keys file. However, the server might access any type of service to do this; again, checking an entry in an LDAP directory comes to mind. Or again, certificates might be used: just as with host authentication, the key here might include a certificate, and any of the certificate’s data might be used to make the authorization decision.  Coming back to our debug trace, we see that the server accepts the offered key:  debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-dss blen 435 lastkey 0x309a40 hint -1 debug2: input_userauth_pk_ok: fp 63:24:90:03:cb:78:85:e6:59:71:49:26:55:81:f5:70 debug1: Authentication succeeded  publickey .  Then it logs the key’s fingerprint and returns the final SUCCESS message, indicating that access is granted and the SSH-AUTH session is finished.  Before moving on to the final protocol phase, let’s examine two other methods defined in SSH-AUTH: password and hostbased authentication.  Password authentication  3.4.3.5 The password method is very simple: its name is “password,” and the data is, sur- prise, the password. The server simply returns success or failure messages as appro- priate. The method it uses to verify the password is implementation-dependent, and varies a great deal: PAM, Unix password files, LDAP, Kerberos, NTLM; all these are available in various products.  The password is passed in plaintext, at least as far as SSH-AUTH is concerned; hence, it is critical that this method be used over an encrypted connection  as is usu- ally the case with SSH . Furthermore, since this method reveals the password to the server, it is crucial that the server not be an impostor. Even if an SSH product may warn of, but allow, a connection to an unauthenticated server in SSH-TRANS, it usu- ally disallows password authentication in SSH-AUTH for this reason. Compare this with the public-key method, which doesn’t reveal the user’s key in the authentica- tion process.  It should be mentioned that “password authentication” is a pretty broad term, and might be construed as encompassing other, better methods. If you think of it as describing any mechanisms that rely on secrets that can be easily memorized and typed by a human, then there are “password” methods with much better security properties than the trivial one described here; the Secure Remote Password protocol  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    61    SRP, http:  srp.stanford.edu   is one. [1.6.5] In this book, however, when we talk about “password” authentication, we mean as defined in SSH-AUTH.  SSH-AUTH also has a set of messages for password changing—for example, allow- ing a user whose password has expired to set a new one before logging in.  3.4.3.6 Hostbased authentication Hostbased authentication is fundamentally different from its public-key and pass- word cousins, in that the server actually delegates responsibility for user authentica- tion to the client host. In short, hostbased authentication establishes trust relationships between machines. Rather than directly verifying the user’s identity, the SSH server verifies the identity of the client host—and then believes the host when it says the user has already authenticated on the client side. Therefore, you needn’t prove your identity to every host that you visit. If you are logged in as user andrew on machine A, and you connect by SSH to account bob on machine B using host- based authentication, the SSH server on machine B doesn’t check your identity directly. Instead, it checks the identity of host A, making sure that A is a trusted host. It further checks that the connection is coming from a trusted program on A, one installed by the system administrator that won’t lie about andrew’s identity. If the connection passes these two tests, the server takes A’s word that you have been authenticated as andrew and proceeds to make an authorization check that andrew@A is allowed to access the account bob@B.  This sort of authentication makes sense only in a tightly administrated environment with less stringent security requirements, or when deployed for very specific and lim- ited purposes, such as batch jobs. It demands that all participating hosts be centrally administered, making sure that usernames are globally selected and coordinated. If not, you could get access to someone else’s account just by adding an account with the same name to your own machine! Also, there’s the problem of transitive compro- mise: once one host is broken, the attacker automatically gets access to all accounts accessible via hostbased authentication from there, without any further work. Nevertheless, hostbased authentication has advantages. For one, it is simple: you don’t have to type passwords or passphrases, or generate, distribute, and maintain keys. It also provides ease of automation. Unattended processes such as cron jobs may have difficulty using SSH if they need a key, passphrase, or password coded into a script, placed in a protected file, or stored in memory. This isn’t only a potential security risk but also a maintenance nightmare. If the authenticator ever changes, you must hunt down and change these hardcoded copies, a situation just begging for things to break mysteriously later on. Hostbased authentication gets around this problem neatly. The “hostbased” request looks like:    Host key algorithm   Client host key  62    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Client hostname   Client-side username, C   Signature  Note that this request has two usernames: the requested server-side account name U present in every SSH-AUTH request, and the client-side username C specific to the hostbased request. The interpretation is that user C on the client is requesting access to account U on the server, and the client’s authentication as C is vouched for by the signa- ture of the client host key. The mapping of which client usernames may access which accounts on the server is up to the implementation. Unix products tend to use seman- tics similar to the historical rhosts syntax, in the files  etc shosts.equiv and ~ .shosts. These can implement global identity mappings, allowing matching usernames auto- matic access, as well as more complicated or limited access patterns.  In order to perform this authentication, the server must verify the client host iden- tity—that is, it must check that the supplied key matches the claimed client host- name  e.g., with a known-hosts file . Having checked that and verified the signature, it then uses that same hostname in the authorization check  e.g., in  etc shosts.equiv , to see if the requested client server name pair is allowed access from this client host. Some implementations also check that the client’s network address actually maps to the given hostname via the local naming service  DNS, NIS, etc. , but this is not really necessary; the meat of the authorization is in the association of the verified hostname supplied in the request, and the authorization rules. In fact, the address check may cause more trouble than it’s worth, in the presence of poorly maintained DNS, network complications such as NAT, firewalls, proxying, etc. Of course, for this whole scenario to make any sense at all, there are yet more admin- istrative burdens to be met. The signature, after all, is supplied by the client; and yet it is interpreted here as a trusted third party—the client host as a separate entity— vouching for the user’s identity. But the user is behind the SSH client; how does this work? The answer is that the client host and SSH software must be arranged so that the user is not fully in control of what’s going on. The private client host key must not be accessible to the user; rather, there must be a trusted service whereby the user can obtain the needed signature for the hostbased authentication request, and such signatures are only issued as appropriate. In a Unix context, usually the private host key file is readable only by the root account, and some part of SSH is installed with special privileges by the sysadmin  “setuid root”; typically this is a separate program called ssh-signer, which serves only this purpose . This trusted program checks the uid of the user running it, and issues signatures only for the corresponding user- name. This effectively translates the local authentication that allowed the person to log in to begin with, into an SSH certificate which can be transmitted and trusted as part of hostbased authentication. This description makes it even more clear how the whole arrangement is predicated on a very centrally controlled and consistently administrated system. One should evaluate very carefully whether hostbased authen- tication is the right choice.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    63   SSH Connection Protocol  SSH-CONN   3.4.4 In its final, successful authentication request, the client specified a service name of “ssh-connection”; this is not visible in the OpenSSH client debug trace but shows up on the server as:  debug1: userauth-request for user res service ssh-connection method publickey  Since it authenticated the client, the server now starts that service, and we move on to the SSH Connection Protocol. This layer actually provides the capabilities that users want to employ directly and that define SSH for most people: remote login and command execution, agent forwarding, file transfer, TCP port forwarding, X for- warding, etc. There is a lot of detail in the connection protocol, but much of it is too low-level for our present discussion; we give a fairly high-level description here, sufficient to inter- pret most debugging messages and to understand how an SSH product provides its services using SSH-CONN. Unlike the earlier protocols, a really detailed understand- ing of SSH-CONN is not usually needed for debugging everyday SSH problems.  Channels  3.4.4.1 The basic service SSH-CONN provides is multiplexing. SSH-CONN takes the single, secure, duplex byte-stream provided by SSH-TRANS, and allows its clients to create dynamically any number of logical SSH-CONN channels over it. Channels are identi- fied by channel numbers, and may be created or destroyed by either side. Channels are individually flow-controlled, and each channel has a channel type which defines its use. Types and other items in SSH-CONN are named in the same extensible man- ner as other SSH namespaces  key exchanges, key algorithm and authenticated method names, etc. . The defined types are: session  The remote execution of a program. Merely opening a session channel does not start a program; that is done using subsequent requests on the channel. An SSH-CONN session may have multiple session channels open at once, simultaneously supporting several terminal, file- transfer, or program executions at once. Various Windows-based SSH products have used this ability for some time now; it has only recently appeared in OpenSSH with the ControlMaster ControlPath feature. [7.4.4.2]  x11  forwarded-tcpip  An X11 client connection. One of these is opened from server to client, for each X11 program using X for- warding as established by an x11-req on a session channel  discussed later .  An inbound connection to a remotely forwarded port. When a connection arrives on a remotely forwarded TCP port, the server opens this channel back to the client to carry the connection.  64    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   direct-tcpip  An outbound TCP connection. This directs the peer to open a TCP connection to a given socket, and attach the channel to that connection. The socket may be specified using a domain name or IP address, allowing a name to be resolved on the remote side in a possibly dif- ferent namespace than the client. These channels are used to implement local TCP forwarding  ssh -L . Preparing for local forwarding is purely a client-side affair: the client simply starts listening on the requested port.* The server first hears of it when a connection actually arrives on the port, whereupon the client opens a direct-tcpip channel with the appropriate target socket. This means that if certain local forwardings are disallowed by the server, this isn’t noticed on connection setup, but only when a connection is actually attempted  Channel semantics are richer than a traditional Unix file handle; the data they carry can be typed, and this facility is used to distinguish between stdout and stderr out- put from a program on a single channel.  Requests  3.4.4.2 In addition to an array of channel operations—open, close, send data, send urgent data, etc.—SSH-CONN defines a set of requests, with global or channel scope. A glo- bal request affects the state of the connection as a whole, whereas a channel request is tied to a particular open channel. The global requests are:  tcpip-forward  Request a remote TCP port forwarding. If the user requests a TCP port be forwarded on the remote side back to the local side  as with “ssh -R” , the SSH client issues this global request. In response, the server starts listening on the indicated port and starts a “forwarded-tcpip” chan- nel back to the client for each connection. This request actually contains the full socket to be bound on the remote: an  address,port  pair and not just a port number. This allows the client to be selec- tive in remote-forwarding remote ports on a multihomed server, or to imple- ment local-only remote forwardings by binding only the loopback address  127. 0.0.1 , on a per-request basis. Not all implementations take advantage of this feature, however; Tectia does, but OpenSSH currently does not.†  cancel-tcpip-forward  Cancel an existing remote forwarding.  * Unlike remote forwarding, no initial setup is required on the remote side. † The OpenSSH team is working on adding this feature.

All rights reserved.  3.4 Inside SSH-2    65   Now let’s summarize the channel requests; except as indicated, most operations refer to the remote side of a session channel:  pty-req  x11-req  env  Allocate a pty, including window size and terminal modes. This creates a pseudo-terminal for the channel, generally required for interactive applications; the pseudo-terminal is a virtual device which makes it appear that the remote program is directly connected to a terminal.  Set up X11 forwarding. Do the preparation necessary for X11 forwarding on the remote; usually involves listening on a socket  TCP or otherwise  for X11 connections, setting the DIS- PLAY variable to point to that socket, and setting up proxy X11 authentication.  Set an environment variable. Although useful, this feature is also a potential security problem. It has not been widely supported by SSH implementations until recently and is generally care- fully controlled. shell, exec, subsystem  Run the default account shell, an arbitrary program, or an abstract service, respectively. These requests start a program running on the remote side, and connect the channel to the program’s standard input output error streams. The “sub- system” request allows a remote program to be named abstractly, rather than being depended on by a particular remote filename. For instance, an SFTP file transfer is usually started by sending a subsystem request with the name “sftp.” The SSH server is configured to execute the correct server program in response to the request; this way, the location of the SFTP server program can change without affecting clients. Or indeed, SFTP could be implemented internal to the SSH server itself, rather than being a separate program, and this, too, would be transparent to clients; this is an option with Tectia.  window-change  Change terminal window size.  Use client-side ^S ^Q flow control.  xon-xoff  signal  exit-status  exit-signal  Send a specified signal to a remote process  as in the Unix kill command .  Return the program’s exit status to the initiator.  Return the signal that terminated the program  e.g., if a remote program dies by signal, as from a segmentation fault or manual kill -9 command .  66    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Theoretically, all these requests are symmetric; that is, the protocol allows the server to open a session channel to the client and request a program to be started on it, for example. However, in most SSH implementations as a remote-login tool, this simply doesn’t make sense, and is an obvious security risk to boot! So, such requests are usually not honored by clients  and the SSH-CONN draft recommends as much .  The ﬁnish line  3.4.4.3 With all this behind us, we can easily make sense of the remainder of the connection setup. The client opens a session channel with id 0:  debug1: channel 0: new [client-session] debug2: channel 0: send open debug1: Entering interactive session.  This session is a terminal login, so next we request a pseudo-terminal on the session channel:  debug1: channel 0: request pty-req  X forwarding is turned on, so the client first gets the local X11 display key by run- ning the xauth program on this side, then requests X forwarding on the remote by sending an x11-req global request:  debug2: x11_get_proto:  usr X11R6 bin xauth list :0 2> dev null debug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing. debug1: channel 0: request x11-req  Agent forwarding is also turned on, so we open a channel for that as well:  debug1: Requesting authentication agent forwarding. debug1: channel 0: request auth-agent-req@openssh.com  But wait... we didn’t mention agent forwarding anywhere in SSH-CONN, nor the channel type that appears here, auth-agent-req@openssh.com. Indeed, that’s because it’s not there; key agents are an implementation detail outside the purview of the protocol. This channel type is an example of the naming extension syntax; it is par- ticular to the OpenSSH implementation. An OpenSSH server accepts such a channel request and sets up an agent-forwarding socket on the remote end  whose details are specific to the OpenSSH program suite . A non-OpenSSH server would refuse the unrecognized request, and agent forwarding would not be available.  Finally, the client issues a “shell” request on the session channel:  debug1: channel 0: request shell  directing the remote account’s default command be started. And at long last...  debug1: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 100000 rmax 1638 Last login: Mon Aug 30 2004 18:04:10 -0400 from foo.host.net $  ...we’re logged in!

SSH-1 has more fixed parameters; in fact, only the bulk cipher is negotiated. The integrity algorithm, host key type, key-exchange methods, etc., are all fixed.  SSH-1 lacks the well-defined naming syntax for SSH-2 entities which allows for smooth, implementation-specific extensions.  Single authentication  RhostsRSA authentication  SSH-1’s user authentication process allows only one method to succeed; the server can’t require multiple methods.  SSH-1’s RhostsRSA authentication, analogous to hostbased, is in principle lim- ited to using a network address as the client host identifier. This limits its useful- ness in the face of network issues such as NAT, proxying, mobile clients, etc.  Less flexible remote forwarding  SSH-1 remote forwarding specifies only a port, not a full socket, so can’t be bound to different addresses on multihomed servers, and the gatewayhosts option must be set globally for all remote forwardings rather than per port.  Weaker integrity checking  SSH-1 uses a weak integrity check, the CRC-32 algorithm. CRC-32 is not crypto- graphically strong, and its weakness is the basis of the Futoransky Kargieman “insertion attack”; see http:  seclists.org lists firewall-wizards 1998 Jun 0095.html.  Server keys  The fixed key exchange of SSH-1 employs an extra asymmetric key called the server key, not to be confused with a host key. [3.6.1] The server key is an ephemeral public private key pair, regenerated once per hour and used to pro- vide forward secrecy for the session key. Forward secrecy means that even if long-term secrets such as user or host private keys are compromised later, these can’t be used to decrypt SSH sessions recorded earlier; the use of an extra key which is never written to disk assures this. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm which is the basis of all the SSH-2 key exchanges provides forward secrecy by itself, and so an extra “server key” is not needed.  68    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Weak key exchange  The SSH-1 key exchange is weak in that the client alone determines the session key, and simply sends it to the server. A Trojaned client can easily use weak keys to compromise all its sessions undetectably.  Implementation Issues  3.6 There are many differences among the current crop of SSH implementations: fea- tures that aren’t dictated by the protocols, but are simply inclusions or omissions by the software authors. Here we discuss a few implementation-dependent features of various products:    Host keys   Authorization in hostbased authentication   SSH-1 backward compatibility   Randomness   Privilege separation  Host Keys  3.6.1 SSH host keys are long-term asymmetric keys that distinguish and identify hosts run- ning SSH, or instances of the SSH server, depending on the SSH implementation. This happens in two places in the SSH protocol:    Server authentication verifying the server host’s identity to connecting clients.  This process occurs for every SSH connection.*    Authentication of a client host to the server; used only during RhostsRSA or  hostbased user authentication.  Unfortunately, the term “host key” is confusing. It implies that only one such key may belong to a given host. This is true for client authentication but not for server authentication, because multiple SSH servers may run on a single machine, each with a different identifying key.† This so-called “host key” actually identifies a running instance of the SSH server program, not a machine.  OpenSSH maintains a single database serving both server authentication and client authentication. It is the union of the system’s known_hosts file   etc ssh ssh_known_ hosts , together with the user’s ~ .ssh known_hosts file on either the source machine  for server authentication  or the target machine  for client authentication . The  * In SSH-1, the host key also encrypts the session key for transmission to the server. However, this use is actu- ally for server authentication, rather than for data protection per se; the server later proves its identity by showing that it correctly decrypted the session key. Protection of the session key is obtained by encrypting it a second time with the ephemeral server key.  † Or sharing the same key, if you wish, assuming the servers are compatible with one another.

All rights reserved.  3.6 Implementation Issues    69   database maps a hostname or address to a set of keys acceptable for authenticating a host with that name or address. One name may be associated with multiple keys  more on this shortly .  Tectia, on the other hand, maintains two separate maps for these purposes:    The hostkeys map for authentication of the server host by the client   The knownhosts map for authentication of the client host by the server  Hooray, more confusing terminology. Here, the term “known hosts” is reused with slightly different formatting  “knownhosts” versus “known_hosts”  for an overlap- ping but not identical purpose.  While OpenSSH keeps host keys in a file with multiple entries, Tectia stores them in a filesystem directory, one key per file, indexed by filename. For instance, a knownhosts directory looks like this:  $ ls -l  etc ssh2 knownhosts  total 2 -r--r--r--   1 root     root       697 Jun  5 22:22 wynken.sleepy.net.ssh-dss.pub -r--r--r--   1 root     root       697 Jul 21  1999 blynken.sleepy.net.ssh-dss.pub  Note that the filename is of the form  . .pub.  The other map, hostkeys, is keyed not just on name address, but also on the server’s TCP listening port; that is to say, it is keyed on TCP sockets. This allows for multiple keys per host in a more specific manner than before. Here, the file- names are of the form key_ _ .pub. The following exam- ple shows the public keys for one SSH server running on blynken, port 22, and two running on wynken, ports 22 and 220. Furthermore, we’ve created a symbolic link to make “nod” another name for the server at wynken:22. End users may add to these maps by placing keys  either manually or automatically by client  into the directories ~ .ssh2 knownhosts and ~ .ssh2 hostkeys.  $ ls -l  etc ssh2 hostkeys  total 5 -rw-r--r--   1 root     root    757 May 31 14:52 key_22_blynken.sleepy.net.pub -rw-r--r--   1 root     root    743 May 31 14:52 key_22_wynken.sleepy.net.pub -rw-r--r--   1 root     root    755 May 31 14:52 key_220_wynken.sleepy.net.pub lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root     28 May 31 14:57 key_22_nod.pub -> key_22_wynken. sleepy.net.pub  Even though it allows for multiple keys per host, Tectia is missing one useful feature of OpenSSH: multiple keys per name. This sounds like the same thing, but there’s a subtle difference: names can refer to more than one host. A common example is a set of load-sharing login servers hidden behind a single hostname. A university might have a set of three machines intended for general login access, each with its own name and address:  login1.foo.edu → 10.0.0.1 login2.foo.edu → 10.0.0.2 login3.foo.edu → 10.0.0.3  70    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In addition, there is a single generic name that carries all three addresses:  login.foo.edu → {10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3}  The university computing center tells people to connect only to login.foo.edu, and the university’s naming service hands out the three addresses in round-robin order  e.g., using round-robin DNS  to share the load among the three machines. SSH has problems with this setup by default. Each time you connect to login.foo.edu, you have a two-thirds chance of reaching a different machine than you reached last time, with a different host key. SSH repeatedly complains that the host key of login.foo. com has changed and issues a warning about a possible attack against your client. This soon gets annoying. With OpenSSH, you can edit the known_hosts file to asso- ciate the generic name with each of the individual host keys, changing this:  login1.foo.edu 1024 35 1519086808544755383... login2.foo.edu 1024 35 1508058310547044394... login3.foo.edu 1024 35 1087309429906462914...  to this:  login1.foo.edu,login.foo.edu 1024 35 1519086808544755383... login2.foo.edu,login.foo.edu 1024 35 1508058310547044394... login3.foo.edu,login.foo.edu 1024 35 1087309429906462914...  With Tectia, however, there’s no general way to do this; since the database is indexed by entries in a directory, with one key per file, it can’t have more than one key per name.  It might seem that you’re losing some security by doing this, but we don’t think so. All that’s really happening is the recognition that a particular name may refer to different hosts at different times, and thus you tell SSH to trust a connection to that name if it’s authenticated by any of a given set of keys. Most of the time, that set happens to have size 1, and you’re telling SSH, “When I connect to this name, I want to make sure I’m connecting to this particular host.” With multiple keys per name, you can also say, “When I connect to this name, I want to make sure that I get one of the following set of hosts.” That’s a perfectly valid and useful thing to do. Another way to solve this problem is for the system administrators of login.foo.com to install the same host key on all three machines. But this defeats the ability of SSH to distinguish between these hosts, even if you want it to. We prefer the former approach.  Authorization in Hostbased Authentication  3.6.2 The most complicated aspect of hostbased authentication is not the method itself, but the implementation details of configuring it, particularly authorization. We’ll discuss:    Hostbased access files   Control file details   Netgroups as wildcards  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.6 Implementation Issues    71   3.6.2.1 Hostbased access ﬁles Two pairs of files on the SSH server machine provide access control for hostbased authentication, in both its weak and strong forms:      etc hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts  weak      etc shosts.equiv and ~ .shosts  strong   The files in  etc have machine-global scope, while those in the target account’s home directory are specific to that account. The hosts.equiv and shosts.equiv files have the same syntax, as do the .rhosts and .shosts files, and by default they are all checked.  If any of the four access files allows access for a particular connection, it’s allowed, even if another of the files forbids it.  The  etc hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts files originated with the insecure r-commands. For backward compatibility, SSH can also use these files for making its hostbased authentication decisions. If you’re using both the r-commands and SSH, however, you might not want the two systems to have the same configuration. Also, because of their poor security, it’s common to disable the r-commands, by turning off the serv- ers in your inetd.conf files and or removing the software. In that case, you may not want to have any traditional control files lying around, as a defensive measure in case an attacker managed to get one of these services turned on again.  To separate itself from the r-commands, SSH reads two additional files,  etc shosts. equiv and ~ .shosts, which have the same syntax and meaning as  etc hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts, but are specific to SSH. If you use only the SSH-specific files, you can have SSH hostbased authentication without leaving any files the r-commands would look at.*  All four files have the same syntax, and SSH interprets them very similarly—but not identically—to the way the r-commands do. Read the following sections carefully to make sure you understand this behavior.  Control ﬁle details  3.6.2.2 Here is the common format of all four hostbased control files. Each entry is a single line, containing either one or two tokens separated by tabs and or spaces. Com- ments begin with , continue to the end of the line, and may be placed anywhere; empty and comment-only lines are allowed.   example control file entry [+-][@]hostspec  [+-][@]userspec   comment  * Unfortunately, you can’t configure the server to look at one set but not the other. If it looks at ~ .shosts, then  it also considers ~ .rhosts, and both global files are always considered.  72    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The two tokens indicate host s  and user s , respectively; the userspec may be omit- ted. If the at sign  @  is present, then the token is interpreted as a netgroup  see the sidebar “Netgroups”  and is looked up using the innetgr    library call, and the resulting list of user or hostnames is substituted. Otherwise, the token is interpreted as a single host or username. Hostnames must be canonical as reported by gethostbyaddr    on the server host; other names won’t work.  If either or both tokens are preceded by a minus sign  – , the whole entry is consid- ered negated. It doesn’t matter which token has the minus sign; the effect is the same. Let’s see some examples before explaining the rules.  The following hostspec allows anyone from fred.flintstone.gov to log in if the remote and local usernames are the same:  The following hostspecs allow anyone from any host in the netgroup “hostbasedus- ers” to log in, if the remote and local usernames are the same, but not from evil. empire.org, even if it is in the hostbasedusers netgroup:    etc shosts.equiv fred.flintstone.gov    etc shosts.equiv -evil.empire.org @hostbasedusers  This next entry  hostspec and userspec  allows mark@way.too.trusted to log into any local account! Even if a user has -way.too.trusted mark in ~ .shosts, it won’t prevent access since the global file is consulted first. You probably never want to do this.    etc shosts.equiv way.too.trusted mark  Don't do this!!  On the other hand, the following entries allow anyone from sister.host.org to con- nect under the same account name, except mark, who can’t access any local account:    etc shosts.equiv sister.host.org -mark sister.host.org   ~wilma .shosts fred.flintstone.gov   ~wilma .shosts fred.flintstone.gov fred  Remember, however, that a target account can override this restriction by placing sister.host.org mark in ~ .shosts. Note also, as shown earlier, that the negated line must come first; in the other order, it’s ineffective.  This next hostspec allows user wilma on fred.flintstone.gov to log into the local wilma account:  This entry allows user fred on fred.flintstone.gov to log into the local wilma account, but no one else—not even wilma@fred.flintstone.gov:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.6 Implementation Issues    73   Netgroups  A netgroup defines a list of  host, user, domain  triples. Netgroups are used to define lists of users, machines, or accounts, usually for access-control purposes; for instance, one can usually use a netgroup to specify what hosts are allowed to mount an NFS file- system  e.g., in the Solaris share command or BSD exportfs . Different flavors of Unix vary in how they implement netgroups, though you must always be the system administrator to define a netgroup. Possible sources for netgroup definitions include:    A plain file, e.g.,  etc netgroup   A database file in various formats, e.g.,  etc netgroup.db   An information service, such as Sun’s YP NIS  On many modern Unix flavors, the source of netgroup information is configurable with the Network Service Switch facility; see the file  etc nsswitch.conf. Be aware that in some versions of SunOS and Solaris, netgroups may be defined only in NIS; it doesn’t complain if you specify “files” as the source in nsswitch.conf, but it doesn’t work either. Recent Linux systems support  etc netgroup, though C libraries before glibc 2.1 support netgroups only over NIS. Some typical netgroup definitions might look like this:   defines a group consisting of two hosts: hostnames "print1" and  "print2", in the  probably NIS  domains one.foo.com and two.foo.com. print-servers         print1,,one.foo.com   print2,,two.foo.com   a list of three login servers login-servers         login1,,foo.com   login2,,foo.com   login1,,foo.com   Use two existing netgroups to define a list of all hosts, throwing in  another.foo.com as well. all-hosts            print-servers login-servers  another,,foo.com   A list of users for some access-control purpose.  Mary is allowed from  anywhere in the foo.com domain, but Peter only from one host.  Alice  is allowed from anywhere at all. allowed-users          ,mary,foo.com   login1,peter,foo.com   ,alice,   When deciding membership in a netgroup, the thing being matched is always con- strued as an appropriate triple. A triple  x, y, z  matches a netgroup N if there exists a triple  a, b, c  inN which matches  x, y, z . In turn, you define that these two triples match if and only if the following conditions are met:  —continued—  74    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   x = a or x is null or a is null  y = b or y is null or b is null  and:  and:  z = c or z is null or c is null  This means that a null field in a triple acts as a wildcard. By “null,” we mean missing; that is, in the triple  , user, domain , the host part is null. This isn’t the same as the empty string:  “”, user, domain . In this triple, the host part isn’t null. It is the empty string, and the triple can match only another whose host part is also the empty string. When SSH matches a username U against a netgroup, it matches the triple  , U , ; similarly, when matching a hostname H, it matches  H , ,  . You might expect it to use  , U, D  and  H, , D  where D is the host’s domain, but it doesn’t.  These entries allow both fred and wilma on fred.flintstone.gov to log into the local wilma account:   ~wilma .shosts fred.flintstone.gov fred fred.flintstone.gov  Now that we’ve covered some examples, let’s discuss the precise rules. Suppose the client username is C, and the target account of the SSH command is T. Then:  1. A hostspec entry with no userspec permits access from all hostspec hosts when  T = C.  2. In a per-account file  ~ .rhosts or ~ .shosts , a hostspec userspec entry permits access to the containing account from hostspec hosts when C is any one of the userspec usernames.  3. In a global file   etc hosts.equiv or  etc shosts.equiv , a hostspec userspec entry per- mits access to any local target account from any hostspec host, when C is any one of the userspec usernames.  4. For negated entries, replace “permits” with “denies” in the preceding rules.  Note Rule 3 carefully. You never, ever want to open your machine to such a secu- rity hole. The only reasonable use for such a rule is if it is negated, thus disallowing access to any local account for a particular remote account. We present some exam- ples shortly. The files are checked in the following order  a missing file is simply skipped, with no effect on the authorization decision :  1.  etc hosts.equiv 2.  etc shosts.equiv  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.6 Implementation Issues    75   3. ~ .shosts 4. ~ .rhosts  -@subset @set  @set -@subset  SSH makes a special exception when the target user is root: it doesn’t check the global files. Access to the root account can be granted only via the root account’s  .rhosts and  .shosts files. If you block the use of those files with the IgnoreRootRhosts server direc- tive, this effectively prevents access to the root account via hostbased authentication.  When checking these files, there are two rules to keep in mind. The first rule is: the first accepting line wins. That is, if you have two netgroups:  set      one,,   two,,   three,,  subset   one,,   two,,   the following  etc shosts.equiv file permits access only from host three:  But this next one allows access from all three:  The second line has no effect, because all its hosts have already been accepted by a previous line.  The second rule is: if any file accepts the connection, it’s allowed. That is, if  etc  shosts.equiv forbids a connection but the target user’s ~ .shosts file accepts it, then it is accepted. Therefore, the sysadmin cannot rely on the global file to block connec- tions. Similarly, if your per-account file forbids a connection, it can be overridden by a global file that accepts it. Keep these facts carefully in mind when using hostbased authentication.*  3.6.2.3 Netgroups as wildcards You may have noticed the rule syntax has no wildcards; this omission is deliberate. The r-commands recognize bare + and – characters as positive and negative wild- cards, respectively, and a number of attacks are based on surreptitiously adding a “+” to someone’s .rhosts file, immediately allowing anyone to rlogin as that user. So, SSH deliberately ignores these wildcards. You’ll see messages to that effect in the server’s debugging output if it encounters such a wildcard:  Remote: Ignoring wild host user names in  etc shosts.equiv  However, there’s still a way to get the effect of a wildcard: using the wildcards avail- able in netgroups. An empty netgroup:  empty   nothing here  * By setting the server’s IgnoreRhosts keyword to yes, you can cause the server to ignore the per-account files  completely and consult the global files exclusively instead. [5.4.4]  76    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   matches nothing at all. However, this netgroup:  matches everything. In fact, a netgroup containing  ,,  anywhere matches every- thing, regardless of what else is in the netgroup. So, this entry:  allows access from any host at all,* as long as the remote and local usernames match. This one:  wild   ,,    ~ .shosts @wild   ~ .shosts way.too.trusted @wild   ~ .shosts @wild @wild  allows any user on way.too.trusted to log into this account, while this entry:  allows any user access from anywhere.  Given this wildcard behavior, it’s important to pay careful attention to netgroup defi- nitions. It’s easier to create a wildcard netgroup than you might think. Including the null triple  ,,  is the obvious approach. However, remember that the order of ele- ments in a netgroup triple is  host,user,domain . Suppose you define a group “oops” like this:  oops         fred,,   wilma,,   barney,,   You intend for this to be a group of usernames, but you’ve placed the usernames in the host slots, and the username fields are left null. If you use this group as the user- spec of a rule, it acts as a wildcard. Thus, this entry:   ~ .shosts home.flintstones.gov @oops  allows anyone on home.flintstones.gov, not just your three friends, to log into your account. Beware!  Summary  3.6.2.4 Hostbased authentication is convenient for users and administrators, because it can set up automatic authentication between hosts based on username correspondence and interhost trust relationships. This removes the burden of typing passwords or dealing with key management. However, it is heavily dependent on the correct administration and security of the hosts involved; compromising one trusted host can give an attacker automatic access to all accounts on other hosts. Also, the rules for the access control files are complicated, fragile, and easy to get wrong in ways  * If strong hostbased authentication is in use, this means any host verified by public key against the server’s  known hosts database.

In an environment more concerned with eavesdropping and disclosure than active attacks, it may be acceptable to deploy hostbased authen- tication for general user authentication. In a more security-conscious scenario, how- ever, it is probably inappropriate, though it may be acceptable for limited use in special-purpose accounts, such as for unattended batch jobs. [11.1.3]  SSH-1 Backward Compatibility  3.6.3 The Tectia server can provide backward compatibility for the SSH-1 protocol, as long as another package supporting SSH-1  such as OpenSSH  is also installed on the same machine. When the Tectia server encounters a client requesting an SSH-1 con- nection, it simply runs the SSH-1 server.* This is rather cumbersome. It’s also waste- ful and slow, since each new sshd1 needs to generate its own server key, which otherwise the single master server regenerates only once an hour. This wastes ran- dom bits, sometimes a precious commodity, and can cause noticeable delays in the startup of SSH-1 connections to a Tectia server. Further, it is an administrative head- ache and a security problem, since one must maintain two separate SSH server con- figurations and try to make sure all desired restrictions are adequately covered in both.  OpenSSH, on the other hand, supports both SSH-1 and SSH-2 in a single set of pro- grams, an approach we prefer.  Randomness  3.6.4 Cryptographic algorithms and protocols require a good source of random bits. Ran- domness is used in various ways:    To generate data-encryption keys   As plaintext padding and initialization vectors in encryption algorithms, to help    For check-bytes or cookies in protocol exchanges, as a measure against packet-  foil cryptanalysis  spoofing attacks  Randomness is harder to achieve than you might think; in fact, even defining ran- domness is difficult  or picking the right definition for a given situation . For exam- ple, “random” numbers that are perfectly good for statistical modeling might be terrible for cryptography. Each of these applications requires certain properties of its random input, such as an even distribution. Cryptography, in particular, demands unpredictability, so an attacker reading our data can’t guess our keys.  * Or it can use an internal SSH-1 compatibility mode.  78    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   True randomness—in the sense of complete unpredictability—can’t be produced by a computer program. Any sequence of bits produced as the output of a program eventually repeats itself. For true randomness, you have to turn to physical pro- cesses, such as fluid turbulence or the quantum dice of radioactive decay. Even there, you must take great care that measurement artifacts don’t introduce unwanted structure.  There are algorithms, however, that produce long sequences of practically unpredict- able output, with good statistical randomness properties. These are good enough for many cryptographic applications, and such algorithms are called pseudo-random number generators, or PRNGs. A PRNG requires a small random input, called the seed, so it doesn’t always produce the same output. From the seed, the PRNG pro- duces a much larger string of acceptably random output; essentially, it is a random- ness “stretcher.” So, a program using a PRNG still needs to find some good random bits, just fewer of them, but they had better be quite unpredictable.  Since various programs require random bits, some operating systems have built-in facilities for providing them. Some Unix variants  including Linux and OpenBSD  have a device driver, accessed through  dev random and  dev urandom, that provides random bits when opened and read as a file. These bits are derived by all sorts of methods, some quite clever. Correctly filtered timing measurements of disk accesses, for example, can represent the fluctuations due to air turbulence around the drive heads. Another technique is to look at the least significant bits of noise coming from an unused microphone port. And of course, they can track fluctuating events such as network packet arrival times, keyboard events, interrupts, etc.  SSH implementations make use of randomness, but the process is largely invisible to the end user. Here’s what happens under the hood. OpenSSH and Tectia, for exam- ple, use a kernel-based randomness source if it is available, along with their own sampling of  one hopes  fluctuating system parameters, gleaned by running such programs as ps or netstat. It uses these sources to seed its PRNG, as well as to “stir in” more randomness every once in a while. Since it can be expensive to gather ran- domness, SSH stores its pool of random bits in a file between invocations of the pro- gram, as shown in the following table:  Server Client  OpenSSH  etc ssh ssh_random_seed ~ .ssh random_seed  Tectia  etc ssh2 random_seed ~ .ssh2 random_seed  These files should be kept protected, since they contain sensitive information that can weaken SSH’s security if disclosed to an attacker, although SSH takes steps to reduce that possibility. The seed information is always mixed with some new ran- dom bits before being used, and only half the pool is ever saved to disk, to reduce its predictive value if stolen.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.6 Implementation Issues    79   In OpenSSH and Tectia, all this happens automatically and invisibly. OpenSSH links against the OpenSSL library and uses its randomness source, a kernel source if avail- able. When building OpenSSH on a platform without  dev random, you have a choice. If you have installed an add-on randomness source, such as the Entropy Gathering Daemon  EGD, http:  www.lothar.com tech crypto  , you can compile OpenSSH to use it with the --with-egd-pool compile-time configuration option. Or you can use the OpenSSH entropy-gathering mechanism. You can tailor which pro- grams are run to gather entropy and “how random” they’re considered to be, by edit- ing the file  etc ssh ssh_prng_cmds. Also, note that the OpenSSH random seed is kept in the ~ .ssh prng_seed file, even the daemon’s, which is just the root user’s seed file. Earlier versions of OpenSSH use this method internally and automatically if there is no  dev random and no pool specified. OpenSSH 3.8 and later have the random gen- erator factored into a separate program, ssh-rand-helper, selected with the --with- rand-helper compile-time configuration option.  Privilege Separation in OpenSSH  3.6.5 A persistent problem in the world of Unix security is the lack of fine-grained permis- sions when it comes to process capabilities. Basically, either you’re God  that is, “root”  or you’re not. The “Church” of Unix is missing the hosts of angels, archan- gels, cherubim, etc., that fill other pantheons and smooth the relationship between mere mortals and the divine, embodied for us in the mystical uid 0. This means that in order to accomplish some common tasks, such as listening on port 22 or creating processes under other uid’s, the SSH server must also take on all the other powers of the root account. This flies in the face of a basic rule of security engineering: the Prin- ciple of Least Privilege, which says that a process should have only the privileges it needs, only when it needs them, and no more. If a serious vulnerability is found in the code of a server running as root, you can kiss your system goodbye, because when an attacker gets in, he has complete control.  In order to address this general problem, OpenSSH has a feature called privilege sep- aration. The developers have factored out those server functions which require root privilege, and placed them in a separate process. The main server does not run as root; it gives up that privilege as soon as possible after startup, leaving a separate privileged “monitor” process with which it can communicate. The monitor opens the server listening socket which the main server inherits, but then closes its copy so that it does not communicate directly with clients  i.e., potential attackers . It com- municates only by a private pipe to the main server and obeys a strict protocol, per- forming only those privileged operations necessary from time to time for the operation of the main server, and nothing else. This design mitigates the problem by restoring the Principle of Least Privilege, at least as much as is possible given the lim- itations of Unix.  80    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Privilege separation is a complicated feature to implement, however, due to many small differences among Unix platforms with regard to the exact behavior of rele- vant system calls such as setuid, seteuid, setgid, etc., as well as difficulties with related software such as PAM. The early implementations of privilege separation in OpenSSH were notorious for causing mysterious errors in the operation of the server. Things have improved a great deal, but if you run into odd problems you can’t explain—especially having to do with a privilege or access violation on the part of the server—you could do worse than to disable privilege separation and see what happens.  For more information on privilege separation, see:    http:  www.citi.umich.edu u provos ssh privsep.html   “Preventing Privilege Escalation,” Niels Provos, Markus Friedl, and Peter Honey- man, 12th USENIX Security Symposium, Washington, D.C., August 2003, http:   www.citi.umich.edu u provos papers privsep.pdf.  SSH and File Transfers  scp and sftp   3.7 The first thing to understand about SSH and file transfers is this: SSH doesn’t really do file transfers. That is, the core SSH protocol as implemented by a program such as ssh  SSH-TRANS, SSH-AUTH, and SSH-CONN  has no file-transfer capability at all. Following good modular design, file transfer is simply one of many services that might be run over an SSH connection channel. In fact, the file-transfer programs bundled with most Unix-based SSH products, scp and sftp, typically don’t even implement SSH in themselves; they simply run ssh in a subprocess to connect to the remote host, start the remote file-transfer agent, and talk to it.  Historically, the first file-transfer mechanism implemented with SSH was the pro- gram scp, included with the original SSH1 product. scp is simply an “ssh-ification” of the venerable Unix rcp program; just as rcp runs the rsh program to contact the remote host, scp runs ssh instead. If existing rsh software had supported a switch to select a different program than the default rsh  like scp -S , scp might never have been written; there would have been no need.  The rcp protocol used by scp is very limited. In a single session it can only transfer a set of whole files in one direction; there’s no directory browsing, partial transfer, resumption of interrupted transfers, multiple transfer directions—in other words, it’s nothing like FTP. When SSH Communications Security  SCS  defined the first ver- sion of the SSH-2 protocol and delivered its implementation, it wanted to include a much better file-transfer utility. To that end, it defined a completely new remote- filing protocol, designed to work easily over a single, reliable, secure, duplex byte- stream connection—that is, over SSH. The utility was called sftp. As with SSH-2, this initially undocumented and proprietary protocol was eventually moved onto the standards track of the IETF SECSH working group, as the “SSH File Transfer Proto- col”  SSH-SFTP . Once that happened it began to appear in other implementations  3.7 SSH and File Transfers  scp and sftp     81  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   as well—for example, the sftp program in OpenSSH—first as a client only for com- patibility with SCS servers, with sftp-server following later.  The name “SFTP” is unfortunate in two respects. First, it suggests that SFTP has something to do with the FTP protocol as defined in RFC-959 et al. It doesn’t: they are completely different. Indeed, that’s largely the point; as with rcp: were FTP ame- nable to use over SSH, SFTP might never have been written. But SSH and FTP are not a good match [11.2], so SFTP was born. It is a common mistake to think you can somehow use an sftp program to connect securely to an FTP server—a reasonable enough supposition, given the name—but you can’t; they’re entirely incompatible.  The name “SFTP” is also misleading in that it suggests security; many assume it stands for “Secure FTP.” This isn’t so. The SFTP protocol has no security features at all; implementations derive their security by speaking the protocol over an SSH connection.  3.7.1 What’s in a Name? So far, this isn’t too bad. There are two file-transfer protocols commonly used over SSH—RCP and SFTP, usually implemented on the client side by the programs scp and sftp. The situation is a bit more complicated, though, because of the way the Tectia software operates. Although Tectia includes a program named scp2, it does not use the RCP protocol; instead, it uses SFTP. The Tectia programs scp2 and sftp2 are simply two different frontends for the SFTP protocol. They merely provide differ- ent user interfaces: scp2 acts like rcp scp, and sftp2 is deliberately similar to an FTP client.  None of this confusing terminology is made any easier by the fact that when installed, Tectia makes symbolic links allowing you to use the plain names scp, ssh, etc., instead of scp2 or ssh2. Even more bizarrely, scp2 has a -1 option that causes it to run a program named scp1 for backward compatibility  of a sort . The upshot is that typing “scp” may get you either of two entirely different protocols, depending on what software is installed, and how it was installed. In our discussion, we ignore this complication; when we refer to scp, we mean an OpenSSH-style scp which uses the RCP protocol.  scp Details  3.7.2 When you run scp to copy a file from client to server, it invokes ssh with various options, like so:   usr bin ssh -x -o ForwardAgent=no -o ClearAllForwardings=yes server-host scp ...  82    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Earlier versions of scp actually searched your PATH for the ssh program rather than specifying it completely. This was a problem if multiple SSH software packages were installed, since it could run mismatched pieces of software together.  This runs another copy of scp on the remote host. That copy is invoked with the undocumented switches –t and –f  for “to” and “from” , putting it into SCP server mode. This next table shows some examples; Figure 3-3 shows the details.  This client scp command: scp foo server:bar scp server:bar foo scp *.txt server:dir  Runs this remote command: scp -t bar scp -f bar scp -d -t dir  Client  Server  % scp file.txt server:renamed.txt  renamed.txt  scp  run "ssh -x -a...server scp -t renamed.txt"  run "scp -t renamed.txt"  file.txt  scp  ssh  scp protocol  sshd  Figure 3-3. scp operation  If you run scp to copy a file between two remote hosts, it simply executes another scp client on the source host to copy the file to the target. For example, this command:  scp source:music.au target:playme  runs this in the background:  ssh -x -o ClearAllForwardings=yes -n source scp music.au target:playme  Note that the options are changed appropriately: agent forwarding is not turned off, as that may be needed by the remote scp client in order to contact the target host.  3.7 SSH and File Transfers  scp and sftp     83  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   scp2 sftp Details  3.7.3 When you run scp2 or sftp under Unix, it also runs an ssh program behind the scenes, as with scp.* The exact details vary depend on which software is in use; remember that sftp comes with both OpenSSH and Tectia. However, they both look like:  ssh [options] server-host -s sftp  Instead of a remote command, this uses an SSH-2 subsystem request to start the sftp server on the remote host. This insulates the client from the details of how SFTP is implemented on the server, rather than embed the sftp-server pathname in the com- mand  which might change , or relaying on the remote PATH setting to find it  which might not work . Unlike scp, here the command line doesn’t specify the files to be transferred; that information is carried inside the SFTP protocol.  Using a subsystem means that the SSH server must be specifically configured to han- dle SFTP. For OpenSSH:   sshd_config subsystem sftp  usr libexec sftp-server  Tectia can either execute an external SFTP server in the same way:   sshd2_config subsystem-sftp  usr libexec sftp-server2  or run the SFTP protocol within the SSH server process itself:   sshd2_config subsystem-sftp internal:  sftp-server  Figure 3-4 shows more details of how sftp operates.  Algorithms Used by SSH  3.8 We now summarize each of the algorithms we have mentioned. Don’t treat these summaries as complete analyses, however. You can’t necessarily extrapolate from characteristics of individual algorithms  positive or negative  to whole systems with- out considering the other parts. Security is complicated that way.  3.8.1  Public-Key Algorithms  Rivest-Shamir-Adleman  RSA   3.8.1.1 The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman  RSA  public-key algorithm is the most widely used asymmetric cipher. It derives its security from the difficulty of factoring large integers  * Tectia for Windows simply integrates SSH into these programs.  84    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Factoring is widely believed to be intractable  i.e., infeasible, admitting no efficient, polynomial-time solution , although this isn’t proven. RSA can be used for both encryption and signatures.  Until September 2000, RSA was claimed to be patented in the U.S. states by Public Key Partners, Inc., a company in which RSA Security, Inc. is a partner.  The algo- rithm is now in the public domain.  While the patent was in force, PKP claimed that it controlled the use of the RSA algorithm in the U.S., and that the use of unautho- rized implementations was illegal. Until the mid-1990s, RSA Security provided a freely available reference implementation, RSAref, with a license allowing educa- tional and broad commercial use  as long as the software itself was not sold for profit . Since RSA is now in the public domain, RSAref has disappeared.  The SSH-1 protocol specified use of RSA explicitly. SSH-2 can use multiple public- key algorithms, but originally defined only DSA. [3.8.1.2] The SECSH working group added the RSA algorithm to SSH-2 shortly after the patent expired.  3.8.1.2 Digital Signature Algorithm  DSA  The Digital Signature Algorithm  DSA  was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency  NSA , and promulgated by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  as part of the Digital Signature Standard  DSS . The DSS was issued as a Federal Information Processing Standard, FIPS-186, in May 1994. It is a public-key algorithm, based on the Schnorr and ElGamal methods, and relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in a finite field. It is designed as a signa- ture-only scheme that can’t be used for encryption, although a fully general imple- mentation may easily perform both RSA and ElGamal encryption.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.8 Algorithms Used by SSH    85   DSA has also been surrounded by a swirl of controversy since its inception. The NIST first claimed that it had designed DSA, then eventually revealed that the NSA had done so. Many question the motives and ethics of the NSA, with ample histori- cal reason to do so.* Researcher Gus Simmons discovered a subliminal channel in DSA that allows an implementor to leak information—for instance, secret key bits— with every signature.† Since the algorithm was to be made available as a closed hard- ware implementation in smart cards as part of the government’s Capstone program, many people considered this property highly suspicious. Finally, the NIST intended DSA to be available royalty-free to all users. To that end it was patented by David Kravitz  patent 5,231,668 , then an employee of the NSA, who assigned the patent to the U.S. government. There have been claims, however, that DSA infringes exist- ing cryptographic patents, including the Schnorr patent. To our knowledge, this issue has yet to be settled in court.  The SSH-2 protocol uses DSA as its required  and currently, only defined  public-key algorithm for host identification.  3.8.1.3 Difﬁe-Hellman key agreement The Diffie-Hellman key agreement algorithm was the first public-key system pub- lished in the open literature, invented by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman, and Ralph Merkle in 1976. It was patented by them in 1977  issued in 1980, patent 4,200,770 ; that patent has now expired, and the algorithm is in the public domain. Like DSA, it is based on the discrete logarithm problem, and it allows two parties to derive a shared secret key securely over an open channel. That is, the par- ties engage in an exchange of messages, at the end of which they share a secret key. It isn’t feasible for an eavesdropper to determine the shared secret merely from observ- ing the exchanged messages.  SSH-2 uses the Diffie-Hellman algorithm as its required  and currently, its only defined  key-exchange method.  3.8.2  Secret-Key Algorithms  International Data Encryption Algorithm  IDEA   3.8.2.1 The International Data Encryption Algorithm  IDEA  was designed in 1990 by Xuejia Lai and James Massey,‡ and went through several revisions, improvements, and renamings before reaching its current form. Although relatively new, it is considered  * See James Bamford’s book, The Puzzle Palace  Penguin , for an investigative history of the NSA. † G. J.

The attitude of Ascom-Tech toward this patent and the use of IDEA in the U.S. has changed over time, especially with regard to its inclusion in PGP. It is free for noncommercial use. Government or commercial use may require a royalty, where “commercial use” includes use of the algorithm internal to a commercial organization, not just directly selling an imple- mentation or offering its use for profit.

The process involved soliciting designs from the worldwide cryptographic community, and pitting them against one another in a design contest of sorts. After a five-year process, the winner was finally selected. The algorithm designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen and originally known as Rijndael became the Advanced Encryption Standard, codified in FIPS-197. AES is a symmetric block cipher with key sizes of either 128, 192, or 256 bits. You can find more information at the following site:  http:  csrc.nist.gov publications fips fips197 fips-197.pdf  3.8.2.3 Data Encryption Standard  DES  The Data Encryption Standard  DES  is the old workhorse of symmetric encryption algorithms, now finally put out to pasture, replaced by AES. Designed by research- ers at IBM in the early 1970s under the name Lucifer, the U.S. government adopted DES as a standard on November 23, 1976  FIPS-46 . It was patented by IBM, but IBM granted free worldwide rights to its use. It has been used extensively in the pub- lic and private sectors ever since. DES has stood up well to cryptanalysis over the years and is increasingly viewed as outdated only because its 56-bit key size is too small relative to modern computing power. A number of well-publicized designs for special-purpose “DES-cracking” machines have been put forward, and their putative prices are falling more and more into the realm of plausibility for governments and large companies. It seems sure that at least the NSA has such devices.  * U.S. patent 5,214,703, 25 May 1993; international patent PCT CH91 00117, 28 November 1991; Euro-  pean patent EP 0 482 154 B1.

It has been proven that the DES function can increase its security by encrypting multiple times with independent keys.* 3DES encrypts the plaintext with three iterations of the DES algorithm, using three separate keys. The effective key length of 3DES is 112 bits, a vast improvement over the 56-bit key of plain DES.  ARCFOUR  RC4   3.8.2.5 Ron Rivest designed the RC4 cipher in 1987 for RSA Data Security, Inc.  RSADSI ; the name is variously claimed to stand for “Rivest Cipher” or “Ron’s Code.” It was an unpatented trade secret of RSADSI, used in quite a number of commercial products by RSADSI licensees. In 1994, though, source code claiming to implement RC4 appeared anonymously on the Internet. Experimentation quickly confirmed that the posted code was indeed compatible with RC4, and the cat was out of the bag. Since it had never been patented, RC4 effectively entered the public domain. This doesn’t mean that RSADSI won’t sue someone who tries to use it in a commercial product, so it is less expensive to settle and license than to fight. We aren’t aware of any test cases of this issue. Since the name “RC4” is trademarked by RSADSI, the name “ARCFOUR” has been coined to refer to the publicly revealed version of the algorithm.  ARCFOUR is very fast but less studied than many other algorithms. It uses a vari- able-size key; SSH-1 employs independent 128-bit keys for each direction of the SSH session. The use of independent keys for each direction is an exception in SSH-1, and crucial: ARCFOUR is essentially a pad using the output of a pseudo-random num- ber generator. As such, it is important never to reuse a key because to do so makes cryptanalysis trivially easy. If this caveat is observed, ARCFOUR is considered secure by many, despite the dearth of public cryptanalytic results.  3.8.2.6 Blowﬁsh Blowfish was designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993, as a step toward replacing the aging DES. It is much faster than DES and IDEA, though not as fast as ARCFOUR, and is unpatented and free for all uses. It is intended specifically for implementation on large, modern, general-purpose microprocessors and for situations with relatively few key changes. It isn’t particularly suited to low-end environments such as smart cards. It employs a variable-size key of 32 to 448 bits; SSH-2 uses 128-bit keys. Blow- fish has received a fair amount of cryptanalytic scrutiny and has proved impervious to attack so far. Information is available from Counterpane, Schneier’s security con- sulting company, at:  http:  www.schneier.com blowfish.html  * Because it doesn’t form a group over its keys. See W. Campbell and M. J.

All rights reserved.   Twoﬁsh  3.8.2.7 Twofish is another design by Bruce Schneier, together with J. Kelsey, D. Whiting, D. Wagner, C. Hall, and N. Ferguson. It was submitted in 1998 to the NIST as a candi- date for the Advanced Encryption Standard, to replace DES as the U.S. govern- ment’s symmetric data encryption standard. It was one of the five finalists in the AES selection process, out of 15 initial submissions, but eventually lost to Rijndael. Like Blowfish, it is unpatented and free for all uses, and Counterpane has provided unco- pyrighted reference implementations, also freely usable.  Twofish admits keys of lengths 128, 192, or 256 bits; SSH-2 specifies 256-bit keys. Twofish is designed to be more flexible than Blowfish, allowing good implementa- tion in a larger variety of computing environments  e.g., slower processors, small memory, in-hardware . It is very fast, its design is conservative, and it is likely to be quite strong. You can read more about Twofish at:  http:  www.schneier.com twofish.html  You can read more about the NIST AES program at:  http:  www.nist.gov aes   CAST  3.8.2.8 CAST was designed in the early 1990s by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares. Tavares is on the faculty of Queen’s University at Kingston in Canada, while Adams is an employee of Entrust Technologies of Texas. CAST is patented, and the rights are held by Entrust, which has made two versions of the algorithm available on a worldwide royalty-free basis for all uses. These versions are CAST-128 and CAST- 256, described in RFC-2144 and RFC-2612, respectively. SSH-2 uses CAST-128, which is named for its 128-bit key length.  3.8.3  Hash Functions  CRC-32  3.8.3.1 The 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check  CRC-32 , defined in ISO 3309,* is a noncryp- tographic hash function for detecting accidental changes to data. The SSH-1 proto- col uses CRC-32  with the polynomial 0xEDB88320  for integrity checking, and this weakness admits the “insertion attack” discussed elsewhere. [3.5] The SSH-2 proto- col employs cryptographically strong hash functions for integrity checking, obviat- ing this attack.  * International Organization for Standardization, ISO Information Processing Systems—Data Communication  High-Level Data Link Control Procedure—Frame Structure, ISO 3309, October 1984, 3rd Edition.

MD5 is unpatented, placed in the public domain by RSADSI, and documented in RFC-1321. It has been a standard hash algorithm for several years, used in many cryptographic products and standards. A successful collision attack against the MD5 compression function by den Boer and Bosselaers in 1993 caused some concern, and though the attack hasn’t resulted in any practical weaknesses, there is an expectation that it will, and people are beginning to avoid MD5 in favor of newer algorithms. RSADSI recommends moving away from MD5 in favor of SHA-1 or RIP- EMD-160 for future applications demanding collision-resistance.*  SHA-1  3.8.3.3 SHA-1  Secure Hash Algorithm  was designed by the NSA and the NIST for use with the U.S. government Digital Signature Standard. Like MD5, it was designed as an improvement on MD4, but takes a different approach. It produces 160-bit hashes. There are no known attacks against SHA-1, and, if secure, it is stronger than MD5 sim- ply for its longer hash value. It has replaced MD5 in some applications; for example, SSH-2 uses SHA-1 as its required MAC hash function, as opposed to MD5 in SSH-1.†  RIPEMD-160  3.8.3.4 Yet another 160-bit MD4 variant, RIPEMD-160, was developed by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart Preneel as part of the European Community RIPE project. RIPE stands for RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation;‡ RACE, in turn, was the program for Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technol- ogies in Europe, an EC-sponsored program which ran from June 1987 to December 1995. RIPE was part of the RACE effort, devoted to studying and developing data integrity techniques. Hence, RIPEMD-160 should be read as “the RIPE Message Digest  160 bits .” In particular, it has nothing to do with RIPEM, an old Privacy- Enhanced Mail  PEM  implementation by Mark Riordan.  RIPEMD-160 isn’t defined in the SSH protocol, but it is used for an implementation- specific MAC algorithm in OpenSSH, under the name hmac-ripemd160@openssh.com. RIPEMD-160 is unpatented and free for all uses.

It is available as a software library called ZLIB at:  http:  www.zlib.net   Threats SSH Can Counter  3.9 Like any security tool, SSH has particular threats against which it is effective and oth- ers that it doesn’t address. We’ll discuss the former first.  Eavesdropping  3.9.1 An eavesdropper is a network snooper who reads network traffic without affecting it in any way. SSH’s encryption prevents eavesdropping. The contents of an SSH ses- sion, even if intercepted, can’t be decrypted by a snooper.  Name Service and IP Spooﬁng  3.9.2 If an attacker subverts your naming service  DNS, NIS, etc. , network-related pro- grams may be coerced to connect to the wrong machine. Similarly, an attacker can impersonate a host by stealing use of its IP address es . In either case, you’re in trou- ble: your client program can connect to a false server that steals your password when you supply it. SSH guards against this attack by cryptographically verifying the server host identity. When setting up a session, the SSH client validates the server’s host key against a local list associating server names and addresses with their keys. If the supplied host key doesn’t match the one on the list, SSH complains. This feature may be disabled in less security-conscious settings if the warning messages get annoying. [7.4.3.1]  The SSH-2 protocol allows for including PKI certificates along with keys. In the future, we hope that implementation of this feature in SSH products along with more common deployment of PKI will ease the burden of key management and reduce the need for this particular security trade-off.  Connection Hijacking  3.9.3 An “active attacker”—one who not only can listen to network traffic, but also can inject his own—can hijack a TCP connection, literally stealing it away from one of its legitimate endpoints. This is obviously disastrous: no matter how good your authen- tication method is, the attacker can simply wait until you’ve logged in, then steal  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.9 Threats SSH Can Counter    91   your connection and insert his own nefarious commands into your session. SSH can’t prevent hijacking, since this is a weakness in TCP, which operates below SSH. However, SSH renders it ineffective  except as a denial-of-service attack . SSH’s integrity checking detects if a session is modified in transit, and shuts down the con- nection immediately without using any of the corrupted data.  Man-in-the-Middle Attacks  3.9.4 A man-in-the-middle attack is a particularly subtle type of active attack and is illus- trated in Figure 3-5. An adversary sits between you and your real peer  i.e., between the SSH client and server , intercepting all traffic and altering or deleting messages at will. Imagine that you try to connect to an SSH server, but Malicious Mary inter- cepts your connection. She behaves just like an SSH server, though, so you don’t notice, and she ends up sharing a session key with you. Simultaneously, she also ini- tiates her own connection to your intended server, obtaining a separate session key with the server. She can log in as you because you used password authentication and thus conveniently handed her your password. You and the server both think you have a connection to each other, when in fact you both have connections to Mary instead. Then she just sits in the middle, passing data back and forth between you and the server  decrypting on one side with one key and re-encrypting with the other for retransmission . Of course, she can read everything that goes by and undetect- ably modify it if she chooses.  true client machine  true server machine  SSH Client  SSH encrypted connections  SSH Server  fake server  fake client  attackers machine  unencrypted data exposed!  Figure 3-5. Man-in-the-middle attack  SSH counters this attack in two ways. The first is server host authentication. Unless Mary has broken into the server host, she is unable to effect her impersonation, because she doesn’t have the server’s private host key. Note that for this protection to work, it is crucial that the client actually check the server-supplied public host key  92    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   against its known hosts list; otherwise, there is no guarantee that the server is genu- ine. If you connect for the first time to a new server and let ssh accept the host key, you are actually open to a man-in-the-middle attack. However, assuming you aren’t spoofed that one time, future connections to this server are safe as long as the server host key isn’t stolen.  The second protection SSH affords is via certain user authentication methods. The password method is obviously vulnerable, but publickey and hostbased authentica- tion resist MITM attacks. Mary can’t discover the session key simply by observing the key exchange; she must perform an active attack in which she carries out sepa- rate exchanges with each side, obtaining separate keys of her own with the client and server. In both SSH-1 and SSH-2, the key exchange is designed so that if she does this, the session identifiers for each side are different. When a client provides a digi- tal signature for either public-key or hostbased authentication, it includes the ses- sion identifier in the data signed. Thus, Mary can’t just pass on the client-supplied authenticator to the server, nor does she have any way of coercing the client into signing the other session ID.*  If you don’t verify the server name key correspondence, Mary can still perform the man-in-the-middle attack, even though she can’t log in as you on the server side. Per- haps she can log into her own account or another she has cracked. With some clever- ness, she might still deceive you long enough to do damage.  3.10 Threats SSH Doesn’t Prevent SSH isn’t a total security solution. We’ll now present some examples of attacks that SSH wasn’t designed to prevent.  3.10.1 Password Cracking SSH dramatically improves password security by encrypting your password as it passes over the network. Nevertheless, a password is still a weak form of authentica- tion, and you must take care with it. You must choose a good password, memorable to you but not obvious to anyone else, and not easily guessable. You must also avoid having your password stolen, since possession alone is sufficient to grant access to your account. So, watch out: the guy at the next terminal might be surreptitiously “shoulder surfing”  watching as you type . That computer kiosk you’re about to use may have been tricked up to log all keystrokes to Cracker Central Command. And the nice-sounding fellow who calls from Corporate IT and asks for your password to “fix your account” might not be who he claims.  * This is not true of the older SSH-1 protocol, however.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.10 Threats SSH Doesn’t Prevent    93   Consider public-key authentication instead, since it is two-factor: a stolen pass- phrase is useless without the private-key file, so an attacker needs to steal both. Of course, the SSH client on the computer you’re borrowing can be rigged to squirrel away your key after you blithely supply your passphrase to decrypt it. If you’re that worried, you shouldn’t use strange computers. In the future, one hopes, crypto- graphic smartcards and readers will be ubiquitous and supported by SSH so that you can carry your keys conveniently and use them in other computers without fear of disclosure.  If you must use password authentication because of its convenience, consider using a one-time password scheme such as S Key to reduce risk. [5.4.5]  IP and TCP Attacks  3.10.2 SSH operates on top of TCP, so it is vulnerable to some attacks against weaknesses in TCP and IP. The privacy, integrity, and authentication guarantees of SSH limit this vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks.  TCP IP is resistant to network problems such as congestion and link failure. If the enemy blows up a router, IP can route around it. It wasn’t designed to resist an adversary injecting bogus packets into the network, however. The origin of TCP or IP control messages isn’t authenticated. As a result, TCP IP has a number of inher- ent exploitable weaknesses, such as:  SYN flood  SYN stands for “synchronize,” and is a TCP packet attribute. In this case, it refers to the initial packet sent to start the setup of a TCP connection. This packet often causes the receiver to expend resources preparing for the coming connection. If an attacker sends large numbers of these packets, the receiving TCP stack may run out of space and be unable to accept legitimate connections.  TCP RST, bogus ICMP  Another TCP packet type is RST, for “reset.” Either side of a TCP connection can send an RST packet at any time, which causes immediate teardown of the connection. RST packets may be injected easily into a network, immediately dis- connecting any target TCP connection. Similarly, there is ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol. ICMP allows IP hosts and routers to communicate information about network conditions and host reachability. But again, there is no authentication, so injecting bogus ICMP packets can have drastic effects. For instance, there are ICMP messages that say a particular host or TCP port is unreachable; forging such packets can cause connections to be torn down. There are also ICMP messages that communicate routing information  redirects and router discovery ; forging such messages can cause sensitive data to be routed through unintended and possibly compro- mised systems.  94    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   TCP desynchronization and hijacking  By clever manipulation of the TCP protocol, an attacker can desynchronize two sides of a TCP connection with respect to data byte sequence numbers. In this state, it is possible to inject packets that are accepted as a legitimate part of the connection, allowing the attacker to insert arbitrary information into the TCP data stream.  SSH provides no protection against attacks that break or prevent setup of TCP con- nections. On the other hand, SSH’s encryption and host authentication are effective against attacks that involve inappropriate routing that would otherwise permit read- ing of sensitive traffic or redirect a connection to a compromised server. Likewise, attacks that hijack or alter TCP data will fail, because SSH detects them, but they also break the SSH connection, because SSH responds to such problems by termination.  Because these threats focus on problems with TCP IP, they can be effectively coun- tered only by lower, network-level techniques, such as hardware link encryption or IPSEC. [1.6.4] IPSEC is the IP Security protocol that is part of the next-generation IP protocol, IPv6, and available as an add-on to the current IP standard, IPv4. It pro- vides encryption, integrity, and data origin-authentication services at the IP packet level.  Trafﬁc Analysis  3.10.3 Even if an attacker can’t read your network traffic, he can glean a great deal of use- ful information by simply watching it—noting the amount of data, the source and destination addresses, and timing. A sudden increase in traffic with another com- pany might tip him off that an impending business deal is in the works. Traffic pat- terns can also indicate backup schedules or times of day most vulnerable to denial- of-service attacks. Prolonged silence on an SSH connection from a sysadmin’s desktop might indicate that she’s stepped out, and that now is a good time to break in, electronically or physically.  SSH doesn’t address traffic-analysis attacks. SSH connections are easily identifiable as they generally go to a well-known port, and the SSH protocol makes no attempt to obfuscate traffic analysis. An SSH implementation could conceivably send random, no-op traffic over a connection when it’s otherwise idle, to frustrate activity correla- tion. OpenSSH, in fact, sends no-op packets in response to keystrokes when a pro- gram turns off tty echo  e.g., the su program prompting for a password . This makes it harder for an attacker to identify the keystrokes of value in a session.  Although the SSH protocol doesn’t specifically deal with traffic analy- sis, some implementations take steps against it. OpenSSH, for exam- ple, hides the fact that terminal echoing has been turned off by sending fake echo packets, making it harder to recognize signatures of non-echoing commands, such as typing the root password after an su prompt.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3.10 Threats SSH Doesn’t Prevent    95   A more serious concern regarding traffic analysis arises from recent work by U.C. Berkeley researchers Dawn Song, David Wagner, and Xuqing Tian. At the 10th Usenix Security Symposium  Washington D.C., August 2001 , they presented a paper titled “Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on SSH”:  http:  www.usenix.org publications library proceedings sec01 song.html  The paper applies traffic-analysis techniques to interactive SSH connections to infer information about the encrypted contents. The authors conclude that the keystroke timing data observable from existing SSH implementations reveals a dangerously sig- nificant amount of information about user terminal sessions—enough to locate typed passwords in the session data stream and reduce the computational work involved in guessing those passwords by a factor of 50. While this work describes a very sophisticated attack which has yet to yield any practical exploits  that we know of! , this area bears watching.  Covert Channels  3.10.4 A covert channel is a means of signaling information in an unanticipated and unno- ticed fashion. Suppose that one day, Sysadmin Sally decides her users are having too much fun, and she turns off email and instant messaging so that they can’t chat. To get around this, you and your friend agree to put messages to each other into world- readable files in your home directories, which you’ll check every once in a while for new messages. This unanticipated communication mechanism is a covert channel.  Covert channels are hard to eliminate. If Sysadmin Sally discovers your file-based technique, she can make all home directories unreadable and unsearchable by any- one but their owners, and prevent the owners from changing this restriction. While she’s at it, she can also make sure you can’t create files anywhere else, like  tmp.  Most of your programs don’t work now, but that doesn’t matter to Sally.  Even so, you and your friend can still list each other’s home directory nodes themselves, which reveals the directory modification date and number of files, so you devise a secret code based on these visible parameters and communicate by modifying them. This is a more complex covert channel, and you can imagine even more outlandish ones in the face of further restrictions from Sally.  SSH doesn’t attempt to eliminate covert channels. Their analysis and control are gen- erally part of highly secure computer systems, such as those designed to handle infor- mation safely at various security classification levels within the same system. Incidentally, the SSH data stream itself can be used perfectly well as a covert chan- nel: the encrypted contents of your SSH session might be a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, while a secret message about an impending corporate merger is represented in Morse code using even odd packet lengths for dashes and dots.  96    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Against stupidity, even the Gods struggle in vain.  —Friedrich von Schiller Security tools don’t secure anything; they only help people to do so. It’s almost a cli- ché, but so important that it bears any amount of repeating. The best cryptography or most secure protocols in the world won’t help if users pick bad passwords, or write their passphrases on Post-it notes stuck to the undersides of their keyboards. They also won’t help sysadmins who neglect other aspects of host security, allowing host-key theft or wiretapping of terminal sessions.  As Bruce Schneier is fond of saying, “Security is a process, not a product.” SSH is a good tool, but it must be part of an overall and ongoing process of security aware- ness. Other aspects of host integrity must still be attended to; security advisories for relevant software and operating systems monitored, appropriate patches or workarounds applied promptly, and people educated and kept aware of their security responsibilities. Don’t just install SSH and think that you’re now secure; you’re not.  3.11 Threats Caused by SSH We can hear the chorus now...“What? I’m using SSH to improve security; what do you mean it causes threats!?” Calm down, we’re just being complete here. There are no new threats that SSH causes per se, but there are existing issues that it perhaps exacerbates.  To employ SSH, your users must be able to make outbound TCP connections: and really, that gives them the power to do just about anything. Think you can restrict which Internet hosts they can contact? Think again: all they need is a proxy on a host they can reach to redirect their traffic. Think they can only use TCP because that’s all the firewall lets through? Not at all: there are freely available tools that can operate a full-blown VPN over a TCP  e.g., OpenVPN . Think you’re safe from inbound attacks because you allow only outbound connections? Don’t be naive: that “out- bound” connection is a two-way street once established and can be connected to anything at all.  The only things that keep people from violating your security policy with this access, aside from respecting the policy itself, are ignorance and inconvenience. Your users might not know how to play any of the preceding tricks, or it might be too much trouble if they do. SSH, however, makes some of these things very easy: tunneling outbound connections to “forbidden” TCP ports, reverse forwarding to tunnel back through your firewall and circumvent it, etc...and everything nicely encrypted so that you can’t see what’s happening!

When there are convenient tools like SSH lying around tempting people to get around annoying limi- tations, you can no longer rely on ignorance and inconvenience to enforce your secu- rity policy. Ultimately, you must gain the trust and cooperation of your users to have an effective security policy.  3.12 Summary The SSH protocol uses openly published, strong cryptographic tools to provide net- work connections with privacy, integrity, and mutual authentication. The original SSH-1 protocol  a.k.a. SSH 1.5  was wildly popular, despite being somewhat ad hoc: essentially a documentation of SSH1’s program behavior. It had a number of short- comings and flaws, of which the weak integrity check and resulting Futoransky Kar- gieman insertion attack is perhaps the most egregious example. The current protocol version, SSH-2, is far superior, but was slow to take off due to the dearth of imple- mentations, licensing restrictions, and the continued availability of the free SSH1 software for many commercial purposes. Thankfully, the tide has now turned, due primarily to the gargantuan and mostly unpaid efforts of the OpenSSH team in bringing forth a free implementation of the SSH-2 protocol.  SSH counters many network-related security threats, but not all. In particular, it is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks based on weaknesses in TCP IP, its underly- ing transport...though now that IPSec is widespread, these weaknesses can be addressed if need be. SSH also doesn’t address attacks such as traffic analysis and covert channels, which may be of concern depending on the environment.  98    Chapter 3:  Inside SSH  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 4x  CHAPTER 4 Installation and Compile-Time Conﬁguration  Now that you know what SSH is and how it works, where do you get it and how do you install it? This chapter surveys several popular and robust implementations of SSH and explains how to obtain, compile, and install them:  OpenSSH  Tectia  A free implementation, originally part of OpenBSD, and available for many other operating systems including Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows.  A suite of commercial products from SSH Communications Security Corp., that run on a variety of platforms including Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, and Win- dows. Formerly known as SSH2 and SSH Secure Shell.  Non-Unix implementations of SSH are covered in Chapters 13–18.  4.1. Overview The first question to consider when installing any implementation of SSH is whether to use a binary or source distribution.  Binary distributions are already configured and compiled, and are therefore easy to use. They are available for popular SSH implementations like OpenSSH and Tectia on a variety of common platforms. The packaging technology and installation instructions vary according to the target system—consult the documentation pro- vided by your vendor for details. For example, on Linux systems, binary distribu- tions are usually shipped as RPM packages, and can be installed using a single command like:  $ rpm -Uhv openssh-3.9p1-1.i386.rpm  Installation on Unix systems typically requires root access, to install files in system directories, and to update the databases that keep track of installed packages.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  99   Binary distributions are often cryptographically signed, to ensure that no one has tampered with the files. Signatures can be provided as separate files, or  depending on the package format  embedded within the binary distribution files, and the tech- nique to verify the signature depends on how the files were signed. For example, on RPM-based Linux systems, first import the vendor’s public key, which is distributed by keyservers or the vendor’s web site:  $ rpm --import http:  www.redhat.com security db42a60e.txt  Then use the public key to check the signature:  $ rpm --checksig -v openssh-3.9p1-1.i386.rpm  Always check the signatures of binary distributions before installing. Imagine the havoc that could be caused if a maliciously hacked ver- sion of SSH was unwittingly used on your system.  Source distributions require more work to install, but allow many more configuration options. They can also be used on platforms for which no binary distributions are available.  To install from sources, perform the following general steps; we’ll cover specific details for OpenSSH and Tectia in subsequent sections.  Install the Prerequisites  4.1.1 Some SSH implementations rely on other software packages; these must be obtained and installed first. The precise requirements sometimes depend on the configuration options chosen: e.g., support for hardware authentication devices  smartcards  might require special libraries.  Obtain the Sources  4.1.2 Source code for open source SSH implementations can be downloaded from each project’s web site, and often a large number of mirror sites. Sources for commercial products are sometimes provided on the distribution media, or are available on ven- dors’ password-protected web sites.  Verify the Signature  4.1.3 Sources should be distributed with a signature file that guarantees the distribution is genuine and has not been modified. [1.6.2] The precise steps used to verify the signa- ture depend on how the source file was signed.  Always check the signature before installing sources. Otherwise, you can be fooled by a hacked version created by an untrusted third party. If you blindly install a  100    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   source without checking the signature, you can seriously compromise your system’s security.  Extract the Source Files  4.1.4 Source distributions are almost invariably packaged in compressed tar format.* File- names ending in .tar.gz  or sometimes .tgz  are compressed using gzip, and can be extracted using a command like:  $ tar xzvf openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz  If your version of tar does not support the z option for running gunzip automati- cally, try:  $ gunzip < openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz  tar xvf -  gzip  and gunzip  can be obtained, if you don’t already have them, from http:   www.gzip.org .  Similarly, filenames ending in .tar.bz2 are compressed using bzip2, and can be extracted using a command like:  $ tar xjvf openssh-3.9p1.tar.bz2  If your version of tar does not support the j option for running bunzip2 automati- cally, try:  $ bunzip2 < openssh-3.9p1.tar.bz2  tar xvf -  bzip2  and bunzip2  can be obtained from http:  sources.redhat.com bzip2.  In all cases, the result is a new subdirectory containing all files in the distribution. The name of the source directory is usually the same as the tar file, e.g., openssh-3. 9p1.  To list the contents of the tar file, without extracting, use the t option instead of x; for example:  $ tar tzvf openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz  Perform Compile-Time Conﬁguration  4.1.5 Most SSH implementations have dozens of configuration options you can set at com- pile time. It’s a good idea to carefully consider each one, instead of blindly accepting the defaults. In fact, the flexibility provided by this compile-time configuration pro- cess is a primary motivation for installing from source distributions.  * Often called a “tarball.”  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.1.  Overview   101   Compile-time configuration is performed by running a script named configure that is usually found in the top-level source directory.* Roughly speaking, the configure script accomplishes two tasks:    It examines the local system, setting various platform-specific and operating- system-specific options. For example, configure notices which header files and libraries are available and whether your C compiler is ANSI or not. It does this by compiling and running a series of carefully constructed, small test programs, examining system files, etc. This happens automatically in most cases, so you can just sit back and watch the script announce what it discovers as it runs.    It includes or excludes certain features found in the SSH source code. For exam-  ple, configure can keep or remove support for Kerberos authentication.  We’ll discuss only the second task, since it’s SSH-specific, and cover only the config- uration options that are directly related to SSH or security. For example, we won’t cover options that relate to the compiler  e.g., whether warnings should be printed or suppressed  or operating system  e.g., whether particular Unix library functions should be used . To see the full set of configure options, use the command:  $ configure --help  Also, read the installation documentation, which is often found in files named README and INSTALL in the source directory.  The behavior of SSH servers can be controlled at three levels. The first is compile- time configuration as discussed in this chapter. In addition, serverwide configuration  Chapter 5  controls global settings for a running SSH server, and per-account config- uration  Chapter 8  controls settings for each user account accepting SSH connec- tions. Figure 4-1 illustrates where compile-time configuration fits into the whole spectrum. We’ll remind you of this picture each time we introduce a new type of configuration.  Compile-time configuration affects both the SSH server and client programs. Chang- ing the configuration requires recompiling and reinstalling, which is neither easy nor convenient, so for most aspects of server and client operation, it’s more appropriate to edit configuration files after installation. Nevertheless, there are some good rea- sons to use compile-time configuration:    Some configuration options can only be set at compile time.   Features that are disabled at compile time can’t be accidentally enabled by erro-  neous configuration files. Inflexibility can be an asset.  * The configure script is generated by a Free Software Foundation package called autoconf. You don’t need to know this to compile SSH, but if you’re interested in learning more about autoconf, visit the GNU web site at http:  www.gnu.org software autoconf .  102    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

SSH compile-time configuration  highlighted parts     Removing code for unused features improves security—you can’t be burned by  security holes in code that you don’t compile!    Similarly, code removal sometimes yields a performance advantage, since less  memory and disk space is used.  The configure script accepts command-line flags, each beginning with a double dash  -- , to control its actions. Flags are of two types:  With without flags  Enable disable flags  Include a package during compilation. These flags begin with --with or --without. For example, support for the X Window System can be included using the flag --with-x and omitted using --without-x.  Set the default behavior of SSH. These flags begin with --enable or --disable. For example, the X forwarding feature in Tectia is enabled by the flag --enable- X11-forwarding or disabled with --disable-X11-forwarding. Some of these defaults can be overridden later by serverwide or per-account configuration.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.1.  Overview   103   Flags beginning with --with or --enable may optionally be followed by an equals sign and a string value, such as:  --with-etcdir= usr local etc --enable-X11-forwarding=no  Various string values are used, but the most common are yes and no. For a given package P, the flags --with-P and --with-P =yes are equivalent. The following table illustrates the relationship:  This next table shows the relationships for a given feature F:  If you write: --with-P=yes --with-P=no  If you write: --enable-F=yes --enable-F=no  It’s equivalent to: --with-P --without-P  It’s equivalent to: --enable-F --disable-F  In the sections that follow, we show many examples of configure with different command-line flags. Most examples demonstrate only one flag at a time, but keep in mind that other flags might be present on the command line. The proper way to run configure is just once, before compilation, with all desired flags on the same com- mand line.  The configure script uses directory information from its own location to embed path- names into the Makefiles, header files, etc., that it creates. Relying on the PATH envi- ronment variable to find the configure script is therefore a bad practice. If you choose to compile within the source directory, specify the current directory explicitly when you run configure:  $ . configure ...options...  Alternately, you can compile in a different directory, which is convenient if the source directory is used for multiple platforms. To do this, create a separate, empty build directory, and run configure there, specifying the source directory for the con- figure pathname:  $ mkdir -p  elsewhere build ssh $ cd  elsewhere build ssh $  somewhere src ssh configure ...  In our examples, we’ll omit the directory components from the configure pathname, but remember that they should be included when you run the script.  104    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Specifying Options for the conﬁgure Script  Be careful when specifying configure options, or you might waste a lot of time. The con- figure script is not very smart, performing little or no sanity checking on its input. For example, if you provide an invalid value, configure can naively run for several minutes, handling 100 other configuration options, before finally reaching the bad value and dying. Now you have to run the script all over again. Unrecognized command-line options are silently ignored, which makes typos espe- cially dangerous. Be sure to check the messages produced by configure as it runs, and especially the configuration summary printed at the end to verify that your options were understood as you intended. Don’t depend on default values, since they might differ among SSH implementations. For maximum security and control, explicitly specify all the options you care about when running configure. The --no-create option causes the configure script to perform all of its checks, but not to create any output files in the build directory. This can be useful if you need to debug an unexpected interpretation of the other options.  Compile Everything  4.1.6 This is simple—just type:  $ make  Compiling can take a while, depending on the speed of your system.  The make command should be run in the same directory where the configure script ran.  If make fails when you attempt to use a separate build directory  i.e., different from the source directory , then you might need to upgrade your version of the make program. A good choice is GNU make, avail- able from http:  www.gnu.org software make .  Install the Programs and Conﬁguration Files  4.1.7 You need root privileges to install files in system directories, which is the usual location:  $ su Password: ********  make install  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.1.  Overview   105   Installing OpenSSH  4.2 OpenSSH is a free implementation of the SSH-1 and SSH-2 protocols, obtained from the OpenSSH web site:  http:  www.openssh.com   OpenSSH is a very complete implementation and includes:    Client programs for remote logins, remote command execution, and secure file  copying across a network, all with many runtime options    A highly configurable SSH server   Command-line interfaces for all programs, facilitating scripting with standard  Unix tools  shells, Perl, etc.     Numerous, selectable encryption algorithms and authentication mechanisms   An SSH agent, which caches keys for ease of use   Support for SOCKS proxies   Support for TCP port forwarding and X11 forwarding   History and logging features to aid in debugging   Example configuration files  etc ssh ssh_config and  etc ssh sshd_config  Since it is developed by the OpenBSD Project, the main version of OpenSSH is spe- cifically for the OpenBSD Unix operating system, and is in fact included in the base OpenBSD installation. As a separate but related effort, another team maintains a “portable” version that compiles on a variety of Unix flavors and tracks the main development effort. The supported platforms include Linux, Solaris AIX, IRIX, HP  UX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and Windows via the Cygwin compatibility library. The por- table version carries a “p” suffix. For example, 3.9p1 is the first release of the porta- ble version of OpenSSH 3.9.  Prerequisites  4.2.1 OpenSSH depends on two other software packages: OpenSSL and zlib. OpenSSL is a cryptographic library available at http:  www.openssl.org ; all the cryptography used in OpenSSH is pulled from OpenSSL. zlib is a library of data-compression routines, available at http:  www.gzip.org zlib . These packages must be on your system before you build OpenSSH.  Downloading and Extracting the Files  4.2.2 Distributions are packaged in gzipped tar format and are extracted with the tar com- mand in the usual way. [4.1.4] The results are stored in a directory with a name like openssh-3.9p1.  106    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Verifying with GnuPG  4.2.2.1 Along with each OpenSSH distribution is a GnuPG  Gnu Privacy Guard  signature. The file openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz, for example, is accompanied by openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz. sig containing the GnuPG signature. To verify the file is genuine, you need GnuPG installed  http:  www.gnupg.org  . Then:  1. If you have not done so previously, obtain the GnuPG public key for the distri-  bution, available from various keyservers on the Internet, such as:  http:  www.keyserver.net http:  pgp.mit.edu  Add the key to your GnuPG key ring by running:  $ gpg --keyserver keyserver --search-keys openssh  and following the instructions.  2. Download both the distribution file  e.g., openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz  and the signa-  ture file  e.g., openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz.sig . 3. Verify the signature with the command:  $ gpg --verify openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz.sig openssh-3.9p1.tar.gz  If no warning messages are produced, the distribution file is genuine.  Always check the GnuPG signatures.  Building and Installing  4.2.3 Building and installing OpenSSH follows the familiar pattern for Unix open source software: configure, make, and make install. [4.1.6] Read the file INSTALL in the top-level source directory for full instructions.  Conﬁguration Options  4.2.4 OpenSSH’s configure script understands a wide range of options to customize its operation. We cover the most significant ones.  4.2.4.1  File locations  --prefix  Determine where to install the software  The make install command installs OpenSSH in the  usr local hierarchy by default, placing ssh into  usr local bin, sshd into  usr local sbin, configuration files into  usr  local etc, and so forth. You can specify a different installation hierarchy, such as  usr, with:  $ configure --prefix= usr  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.2 Installing OpenSSH    107   Other options offer more fine-grained control over installation directories, such as --bindir for the executables normally placed in a bin directory, --sbindir for the sbin files, --sysconfdir for the etc files, --mandir for manpages, and so on: run con- figure --help for the full list.  --with-default-path=PATH --with-superuser-path=PATH  Default server PATH Superuser’s server PATH  You can set the default command search path for OpenSSH when attempting to run a subprogram, and an alternative path for the superuser.  --with-ssl-dir=PATH  Set path to OpenSSL installation  If OpenSSL isn’t installed in the usual place,  usr local ssl, use this option to indicate its location.  --with-xauth=PATH  Set path to xauth program  In OpenSSH, the default location of the xauth program for X authentication is a compile-time parameter.  --with-pid-dir=PATH  Specify location of ssh.pid file  The location of the OpenSSH pid file, where it stores the pid of the currently run- ning daemon, can be changed via the --with-pid-dir option. The default is  var run  sshd.pid.  4.2.4.2  Random number generation  --with-random=FILE --with-rand-helper  Read random bits from given file, normally  dev urandom Use external program to generate randomness  OpenSSH normally relies on the OpenSSL library to provide a stream of random bits for its cryptographic needs. The OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator  PRNG  needs to be “seeded” to start with, and then periodically, with an initial seg- ment of unpredictable bits  as truly random as is available . If the operating system supplies random bits, OpenSSL uses this to seed itself; for example, many Unix vari- ants provide random bits via a device driver accessible through  dev random or  dev  urandom.  If your platform doesn’t provide any randomness source, you need to build OpenSSH with:  configure --with-rand-helper  OpenSSH then runs the external program ssh-rand-helper to seed the PRNG.  --with-prngd-port=PORT --with-prngd-socket=FILE  Read entropy from PRNGD EGD TCP localhost:PORT Read entropy from PRNGD EGD socket FILE  default=  var run egd-pool   108    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If your system is running the Entropy Gathering Daemon  EGD  package  http:   www.lothar.com tech crypto  , you can use it with the --with-prngd-port and --with- prngd-socket options.  The ssh-rand-helper program uses a configurable set of commands that monitor changing aspects of system operation, mixing their output together to produce its random bits. You can control which commands are used and how, with the file  etc  ssh ssh_prng_cmds.  --with-egd-pool=FILE  Read randomness from EGD pool FILE  default none   If you install EGD as described earlier, use the --with-egd-pool option to have OpenSSH use EGD as its randomness source.  4.2.4.3 Networking  --with-ipaddr-display  Use IP address instead of hostname in $DISPLAY  In X forwarding, use DISPLAY values of the form 192.168.10.1:10.0 instead of hostname:10.0. This option works around certain buggy X libraries that do weird things with the hostname version, using some sort of IPC mechanism for talking to the X server rather than TCP.  --with-ipv4-default --with-4in6  Use IPv4 unless “-6” is given Check for and convert IPv4 in IPv6 mapped addresses  OpenSSH supports IPv6, the next-generation TCP IP protocol suite that is still in the development and very early deployment stages on the Internet  the current version of IP is IPv4 . The default configuration of OpenSSH attempts to use IPv6 where possi- ble, and sometimes this results in problems. If you encounter errors mentioning “af=10” or “address family 10,” that’s IPv6, and you should try the –4 runtime option, or compiling --with-ipv4-default.  4.2.4.4  Authentication  --with-pam --without-pam  Enable PAM support Disable PAM support  PAM, the Pluggable Authentication Modules system, is a generic framework for authentication, authorization, and accounting  AAA . The idea is that programs call PAM to perform AAA functions, rather than implementing these functions them- selves. This allows the sysadmin to configure individual programs to use various kinds of authentication, apply account restrictions, do logging, etc., via dynamically loaded libraries. PAM-aware services can be configured to do almost anything in the way of AAA, in a consistent manner and without having to change the services them- selves. See the manpage for pam or visit http:  www.kernel.org pub linux libs pam  for more information on PAM.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.2 Installing OpenSSH    109   In order for OpenSSH to use PAM, the support must be compiled in. PAM is very common these days, so most OpenSSH binary packages include support; if your’s doesn’t, use the --with-pam option. Actually, configure detects PAM if you have it, so the option is often not necessary.  In addition, you must set the UsePAM configuration keyword in the SSH server:   sshd_config UsePAM yes  ssh    This is off by default.  Setting UsePAM causes sshd to do three separate things:    Enable the PAM “device” for keyboard-interactive authentication [5.4.6]   Verify password authentication using PAM   Execute all system PAM modules configured for ssh  usually found in  etc pam.d   Note that the execution action is a very powerful feature; you can customize sshd’s behavior in many ways with PAM modules. Look on your system for the PAM mod- ules available and their documentation, e.g.,  lib security and  usr share doc libpam-doc.  Generally, if a program uses PAM, some host configuration is necessary to describe how PAM should behave for that program. The PAM configuration files are usually in the directory  etc pam.d, or in the single file  etc pam.conf. Most OpenSSH pack- ages automatically add the requisite PAM configuration for sshd; otherwise, you’ll need to do it, usually by copying the appropriate sshd.pam file from the contrib direc- tory to  etc pam.d sshd. Samples for various operating systems are included in the contrib directory of the OpenSSH source. Note that you don’t need to restart sshd if you change its PAM configuration; the configuration files are checked on every use of PAM.  --with-md5-passwords --without-shadow  Enable use of MD5 passwords Disable shadow password support  These options control OpenSSH’s treatment of the Unix account database  a.k.a. passwd map . They are relevant only if OpenSSH isn’t using PAM, since otherwise PAM deals with reading the account information, not the OpenSSH code proper.  Enable --with-md5-passwords if your system uses MD5 instead of the traditional crypt function to hash passwords, and you are not using PAM.  “Shadow passwords” refers to the practice of keeping the hashed password in a restricted file,  etc shadow   etc passwd must be world-readable . Use --without- shadow to suppress reading of the  etc shadow file, should it be necessary.  --with-kerberos5=PATH --with-skey  Enable Kerberos-5 support Enable S Key support  110    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The --with-kerberos5 option installs Kerberos support [11.4], and the --with-skey option enables support for the S Key one-time password system for password authentication. [5.4.5]  4.2.4.5  Access control  --with-tcp-wrappers --without-tcp-wrappers  Include TCP-wrappers support Remove TCP-wrappers support  These options include support for TCP-wrappers, providing the path to the wrapper library, libwrap.a. If the library and header file for TCP-wrappers are not installed in the standard locations, you can provide a pathname as an argument. The pathname can either be a build directory that contains both the library and header file:  $ configure --with-tcp-wrappers= var tmp build tcp-wrappers  or it can be an installation directory with lib and include subdirectories:  $ configure --with-tcp-wrappers= usr local tcp-wrappers  If your Unix installation doesn’t include the TCP-wrappers library, you can retrieve and compile it yourself from ftp:  ftp.porcupine.org pub security index.html. For more information on TCP-wrappers, read the manpages for tcpd and hosts_access.  Installing Tectia  4.3 Tectia is a commercial implementation of the SSH-2 protocol, with some limited support for compatibility with the older  and deprecated  SSH-1 protocol. Binary distributions can be downloaded for evaluation  with a limited license that is valid for 30 days  from the SSH Communications Security web site:  http:  www.ssh.com   Fully licensed Tectia products, with distribution media and documentation, can be purchased from the same web site.  Tectia is designed for deployment across large corporate networks, and offers tre- mendous flexibility, power, and reliability. The products include:    Client programs for remote logins, remote command execution, and secure file  copying across a network, all with many runtime options    A highly configurable SSH server   Command-line interfaces for all programs, facilitating scripting with standard  Unix tools  shells, Perl, etc.     Numerous, selectable encryption algorithms and authentication mechanisms   An SSH agent, which caches keys for ease of use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    111     Support for SOCKS proxies   Support for TCP port forwarding and X11 forwarding   History and logging features to aid in debugging   FIPS 140-2 certification for U.S. government applications  Prerequisites  4.3.1 Tectia is fully self contained, and requires no other packages if installed on one of the supported platforms. Some configuration options require you to install other soft- ware packages, however; these are discussed below.  Obtaining and Extracting the Files  4.3.2 Binary distributions are packaged according to the target platform, and can be installed according to the documentation provided for each system.  Source distributions are packaged in gzipped tar format. For Version 4.1 and earlier, the sources are included with the distribution media for the Tectia Server for Unix product. Starting with Version 4.2, the sources are available only for commercial licenses and only upon request, via a protected area of the SSH Communications Security web site. No sources are provided for the Windows products.  To extract the files, use the tar command in the usual way. [4.1.4] The results are stored in a directory with a name like ssh-4.2.1.1-commercial.  Verifying with md5sum  4.3.3 Binary and source distribution files are protected from tampering by MD5 message digests. Each file is accompanied by a separate file with an extra .md5 suffix contain- ing the digest.  To verify the integrity of the files, use the md5sum command to compute the digest, and compare the result to the contents of the corresponding .md5 file:  $ md5sum ssh-4.1.0.34-commercial.tar.gz 0c7be85eb79e80e893d4c258df8443f0  ssh-4.1.0.34-commercial.tar.gz $ cat ssh-4.1.0.34-commercial.tar.gz.md5 0c7be85eb79e80e893d4c258df8443f0  Here’s a brash one-liner for verification in a single step:  $ md5sum ssh-4.1.0.34-1.i386.rpm  cut -c 1-32  cmp - ssh-4.1.0.34-1.i386.rpm.md5  If the command succeeds silently, the message digests are equal.  Unfortunately, Tectia doesn’t sign installers for binary package formats  like RPM  that support embedded signatures. MD5 message digests are provided for these installers, however.  112    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Building and Installing  4.3.4 To build and install Tectia, use the standard steps that we have described previ- ously: configure, make, and make install. [4.1.6] The following files are installed:    The server program sshd2, and a link to it called sshd.   The secure FTP server program sftp-server2, and a link to it called sftp-server.   The clients ssh2, scp2, and sftp2, and links to them called ssh, scp, and sftp,  respectively.    Support programs ssh-add2, ssh-agent2, ssh-askpass2, ssh-keygen2, ssh-probe2, and ssh-signer2, and links to them called ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-askpass, ssh-key- gen, ssh-probe, and ssh-signer, respectively.    The additional support programs sshd-check-conf and ssh-dummy-shell.   The standard crypto library libsshcrypto-std and the FIPS-compliant library  libsshcrypto-fips if supported for the target system. The library filenames will have a platform-dependent suffix, e.g., libsshcrypto.a or libsshcrypto.so.    The ssh-crypto-library-chooser script used to switch between standard and FIPS  mode. [5.3.5]    The password change plugin ssh-passwd-plugin [5.4.2.3] and  if configured  the  SecurID plugins ssh-securidv4-plugin and ssh-securidv5-plugin. [5.4.5.2]    A newly generated host key pair, created by ssh-keygen2 and placed by default  into  etc ssh2 hostkey  private key  and  etc ssh2 hostkey.pub  public key .    The server configuration file,  etc ssh2 sshd2_config by default [5.2.1], plus sam-  ple subconfiguration files in  etc ssh2 subconfig.    The client configuration file,  etc ssh2 ssh2_config by default. [7.1.2]   The password plugin configuration file,  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config. [5.4.2.3]   Manpages for the various programs.  Conﬁguration Options  4.3.5 Tectia’s configure script understands a wide variety of options to customize its opera- tion. We cover the most significant ones.  4.3.5.1  File locations and permission  --prefix  Determine where to install the software  The make install command installs Tectia in the  usr local directory by default. Pro- grams that are normally run by users  e.g., ssh  are installed in the bin subdirectory, programs run by sysadmins  e.g., sshd  in the sbin subdirectory, manpages in the  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    113   man subdirectory, etc. Use the --prefix option to specify a different parent direc- tory, such as  usr local tectia:  $ configure --prefix= usr local tectia  If your system uses an unusual layout for specific subdirectories, options such as --bindir, --sbindir, and --mandir allow more precise control over the location of individual components. The configure --help command lists all of the options for the subdirectories.  .  --with-foreign-etcdir --with-etcdir  Specify directory for system configuration files Specify directory for Tectia configuration files  By default, Tectia assumes that the standard location for system configuration files is the  etc directory, and installs its own configuration files in a subdirectory,  etc ssh2. To change the system configuration directory  continuing to use an ssh2 subdirec- tory for Tectia’s files by default , use the --with-foreign-etcdir option:  $ configure --with-foreign-etcdir= usr local etc  To independently change Tectia’s configuration directory, use the --with-etcdir option:  $ configure --with-etcdir= usr local etc ssh2  --with-piddir  Specify directory for pid files  The Tectia server stores its process ID  pid  in a file to facilitate sending signals. [5.3.1.3] By default, the pid file is created in the  var run directory. Use the --with- piddir option to change this directory:  $ configure --with-piddir= var local pid  The --with-foreign-etcdir, --with-etcdir, and --with-piddir options are unusual because there are no corresponding “--without” options.  --enable-suid-ssh-signer --disable-suid-ssh-signer  Install ssh-signer setuid root Install ssh-signer unprivileged  Tectia uses a separate ssh-signer program to sign authentication packets for trusted- host authentication. Normally this program is installed with setuid root permissions so it can read the local host key file, which is readable only by the superuser.  You can install the program without setuid root permissions to eliminate possible security holes, but then hostbased authentication fails. [3.4.3.6]  4.3.5.2  Random number generation  --with-ansi-rng --without-ansi-rng  Use ANSI X9.62 random number generator Use SSH random number generator  114    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia uses its own random number generator by default. The --with-ansi-rng option configures Tectia to use the ANSI X9.62 random number generator  a.k.a. the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or ECDSA  instead. This might be required for FIPS-standard compliance in some deployments.  4.3.5.3 Networking  --with-ipv6 --without-ipv6  Include IPv6 support Remove IPv6 support  Tectia supports IPv6, the next generation of IP protocols, in addition to IPv4, the current standard. You can remove IPv6 support if you don’t need it or if you experi- ence problems with it on your operating system.  --enable-tcp-nodelay --disable-tcp-nodelay  Enable Nagle Algorithm Disable Nagle Algorithm  If you plan to operate Tectia over a wide-area network as opposed to a speedy Ether- net connection, you might consider disabling TCP IP’s NODELAY feature, a.k.a. the Nagle Algorithm, for SSH connections. The Nagle Algorithm reduces the number of TCP segments sent with very small amounts of data, such as the small byte sequences of a terminal session. You can disable it at compile time with the --disable-tcp- nodelay flag. Alternatively, you can enable or disable it during serverwide configura- tion using the NoDelay configuration keyword. [5.3.3.9]  --with-libwrap --without-libwrap  Include TCP-wrappers support Remove TCP-wrappers support  TCP-wrappers is a security feature for applying access control to incoming TCP con- nections based on their source address. [9.5] For example, TCP-wrappers can verify the identity of a connecting host by performing DNS lookups, or it can reject connec- tions from given addresses, address ranges, or DNS domains. Although Tectia already includes some of this kind of control with features such as AllowHosts, DenyHosts, etc., TCP-wrappers is more complete. It allows some controls not cur- rently implemented in any SSH version, such as restricting the source of forwarded X connections.  Tectia includes support for TCP-wrappers if the flag --with-libwrap is given at com- pile time. If the TCP-wrappers library and header file were not installed in the stan- dard locations, provide a pathname as an argument. The pathname can refer to the library in a build directory:  $ configure --with-libwrap= var tmp build tcp-wrappers libwrap.a  in which case the tcpd.h header file is assumed to be located in the same directory. Alternately, the pathname can refer to the directory where the library was installed:  $ configure --with-libwrap= usr local lib  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    115   in which case the tcpd.h header file is assumed to be in a directory with its last com- ponent replaced by “include”  for the previous command,  usr local include .  If your Unix installation doesn’t include the TCP-wrappers library, you can retrieve and compile it yourself from:  ftp:  ftp.porcupine.org pub security index.html  For more information on TCP-wrappers, read the manpages for tcpd and hosts_ access.  --with-ssh-connection-limit  Specify maximum number of simultaneous connections  You can instruct Tectia to limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections it supports. By default, it accepts an unlimited number of connections, but if you want to conserve resources on the server machine, you can set a limit. The appropri- ate flag is --with-ssh-connection-limit with a nonnegative integer argument; for example:  $ configure --with-ssh-connection-limit=50  You can override this value at runtime with the serverwide configuration keyword MaxConnections. [5.3.3.7]  4.3.5.4  X Window System  --with-x --without-x  Include X Window System support Remove X Window System support  If you plan to use SSH to communicate between hosts running the X Window Sys- tem, make sure to include support for X at compile time.  By default, it is included.  Conversely, if you never have anything to do with X, you can leave out the support, thereby saving some memory and disk space. Few people have a strong need to elim- inate X support.  --enable-X11-forwarding --disable-X11-forwarding  Enable X forwarding Disable X forwarding  These options enable or disable support for X forwarding, which allows X applica- tions opened on the SSH server machine to appear on the SSH client machine’s dis- play. [9.4] These flags set Tectia’s default behavior only. X forwarding can be further enabled or disabled through serverwide configuration using the ForwardX11 configu- ration keyword. [9.4.3]  --with-x11-security --without-x11-security  Use the X SECURITY extension Don’t use the X SECURITY extension  By default, Tectia uses the X SECURITY extension  if supported by your X installa- tion  to control the level of display access granted to X clients through forwarded  116    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   connections. The --without-x11-security option causes Tectia to treat all X clients as trusted, which grants full access to the display. Trusted X clients can use their dis- play access to capture information from other clients, so you should carefully con- sider the ramifications of disabling the X SECURITY extension.  4.3.5.5  TCP port forwarding  --enable-tcp-port-forwarding --disable-tcp-port-forwarding  Enable port-forwarding support Disable port-forwarding support  Port forwarding enables Tectia to encrypt the data passing through any TCP IP- based program. [9.2] This feature can be disabled at compile time if desired. X Win- dow forwarding isn’t affected by these general port-forwarding flags.  4.3.5.6  Encryption  --with-rsa --without-rsa  Include support for RSA encryption Remove support for RSA encryption  By default, Tectia includes an implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm for public-key authentication. [3.8.1.1] You can remove support for RSA if you’ll never need it. The option was formerly used to avoid infringing a patent that expired in 2000. Now that the algorithm is in the public domain, it is rarely desirable to remove RSA support.  4.3.5.7  Authentication  --with-passwd-plugin --without-passwd-plugin  Include support for password-change plugins Remove support for password-change plugins  Tectia can run a separate password-change plug-in program to manage the process of changing expired passwords during authentication. [5.4.2.3] The configuration option --with-passwd-plugin includes support for this mechanism in the server, and also builds a generic plugin named ssh-passwd-plugin. The option --without-passwd- plugin can be used to remove these features if they are not needed.  --enable-server-kbd-interactive  --disable-server-kbd-interactive  --enable-client-kbd-interactive  --disable-client-kbd-interactive  Include support for keyboard-interactive authentication in the server Remove support for keyboard-interactive authentication from the server Include support for keyboard-interactive authentication in the client Remove support for keyboard-interactive authentication from the client  Keyboard-interactive authentication is an extensible, general-purpose mechanism for implementing a variety of authentication techniques that require interaction with the  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    117   remote user. Support for keyboard-interactive authentication is included by default, but it can be removed from the Tectia server and client using separate configure options.  Note that other authentication techniques such as SecurID and PAM are based on keyboard-interactive authentication, so if you remove support for it, these tech- niques will not work.  --with-serversecurid  Include support for SecurID authentication  SecurID is an authentication mechanism in which users carry electronic cards, approximately the size of a credit card, that display randomly changing integers. During authentication, the user is prompted to type whatever number appears on the card at the time, in addition to a username and password.  To compile Tectia with SecurID support, use the flag --with-serversecurid, provid- ing the path to the directory containing SecurID’s header files and libraries:  $ configure --with-serversecurid= usr local ace  SecurIDv5 is the most recent version at press time.  --enable-serversecurid-submethod --disable-serversecurid-submethod  Include SecurID support in the server Use an external plugin for SecurID support  By default, SecurID support is built into the Tectia server, and is used as a keyboard- interactive submethod. Alternately, SecurID can be supported by an external pro- gram, ssh-securidv5-plugin. [5.4.5.2]  --with-serversecuridv4  Include support for SecurIDv4 plugin authentication  Support for the older SecurIDv4 can be included by specifying the --with- serversecuridv4 option. The SecurIDv4 installation directory must be provided as an argument:  $ configure --with-serversecuridv4= usr local ace4  --enable-legacy-securid  Include support for old SecurID clients  Very old SecurID clients can be supported by a legacy securid-1@ssh.com keyboard- interactive submethod.  --with-daemonpam  --without-daemonpam  --with-clientpam  --without-clientpam  Include support for PAM authentication in the server Remove support for PAM authentication from the server Include support for PAM authentication in the client Remove support for PAM authentication from the client  118    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Normally PAM support is included for both the SSH server and client if it is pro- vided by the target system. This support can be removed using separate options for the server or client, but it is rarely desirable to do so.  --with-daemon-pam-service-name  Specify PAM service name  By default, Tectia uses “sshd2” as the PAM service name: this refers to Tectia in the PAM configuration files. You can change the name by providing it as an argument for the --with-daemon-pam-service-name option:  $ configure --with-daemon-pam-service-name=tectia  --with-pgp --without-pgp  Include support for PGP authentication Remove support for PGP authentication  Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, is a popular encryption and authentication program available for many computing platforms. [1.6.2] Tectia optionally authenticates users based on their PGP keys, so long as those keys comply with the OpenPGP standard  RFC-2440, “OpenPGP Message Format”; some PGP versions, especially older ones, might not be OpenPGP-compliant . PGP support is included by default. [6.5]  --with-kerberos5 --without-kerberos5  Include support for Kerberos-5 authentication Remove support for Kerberos-5 authentication  Kerberos is an authentication mechanism that passes around tickets, small sequences of bytes with limited lifetimes, in place of user passwords. [11.5.2.2] The configura- tion flags --with-kerberos5 and --without-kerberos5 control whether Kerberos sup- port is included or excluded during the build. Tectia’s Kerberos-5 support is experimental, and is not included by default.  If Kerberos was installed in a nonstandard location, the installation directory can be provided as an argument:  $ configure --with-kerberos5= usr local kerberos5  --with-gssapi --without-gssapi  Include support for GSSAPI authentication Remove support for GSSAPI authentication  GSS  Generic Security Services  is an emerging standard that facilitates negotiation of security parameters among a wide variety of platforms. [11.5.2.2] Tectia can be com- piled to use GSSAPI libraries and header files to support this standard. If the GSSAPI installation is in a nonstandard location, specify the directory  with lib and include subdirectories  as an argument for the --with-gssapi option:  $ configure --with-gssapi= usr local gssapi  --enable-gssapi-dynamic --disable-gssapi-dynamic  Enable dynamic loading of GSSAPI libraries Force static linking of GSSAPI libraries  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    119   By default, GSSAPI libraries are linked statically into the SSH server and client. The libraries can optionally be loaded dynamically at runtime: this allows new security mechanisms to be added by replacing the libraries, without recompiling Tectia.  4.3.5.8  SOCKS proxies  --with-socks-server  Specify default SOCKS server  SOCKS is a network protocol for proxies. A proxy is a software component that mas- querades as another component to hide or protect it. For example, suppose a com- pany permits its employees to surf the Web but doesn’t want the hostnames of its internal machines to be exposed outside the company. A proxy server can be inserted between the internal network and the Internet so that all web requests appear to be coming from the proxy. In addition, a proxy can prevent unwanted transmissions from entering the internal network, acting as a firewall.  Tectia supports both Versions 4 and 5 of the SOCKS protocol,* and no external library or special configuration options are needed. The SOCKS feature is controlled by the SocksServer client configuration keyword. [7.4.7] In addition to the usual methods of setting this in a configuration file or on the command line with –o, you can also set it using the SSH_SOCKS_SERVER environment variable.  SocksServer has an empty default value, causing Tectia to assume there’s no SOCKS server. The configuration flag --with-socks-server gives nonempty default value to this parameter, allowing you to set up a Tectia installation that assumes the pres- ence of a SOCKS server. Note that this isn’t the same as using the SocksServer key- word in the global client configuration file, because the keyword overrides the environment variable. If you use the compilation option, users can specify an alter- nate SOCKS server with SSH_SOCKS_SERVER; if you use the global file, they can’t  although they can still override using their own SocksServer directive .  See http:  www.socks.permeo.com  for more information on SOCKS. [7.4.7]  4.3.5.9 Debugging  --enable-debug --disable-debug --enable-debug-heavy --disable-debug-heavy  Enable light debugging Disable light debugging Enable heavy debugging Disable heavy debugging  Tectia programs  both the server and client  produce detailed debugging output on demand. [5.9] If desired, Tectia can be compiled with or without two levels of debugging output. Without the debugging code, the programs might experience a  * Except for SOCKS5 authentication methods.  120    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   slight increase in performance, but with it, the programs are easier to maintain. We recommend including at least some debugging code, because you never know when you’ll need to diagnose a problem.  “Light” and “heavy” debugging are two levels of debugging that you can specify in the source code. Light debugging output is controlled by the configure flags --enable- debug and --disable-debug  the default . Heavy debugging output is controlled by the configure flags --enable-debug-heavy and --disable-debug-heavy  the default . Heavy debugging automatically enables light debugging. We recommend turning on heavy debugging or else the messages will contain too little information to be useful.  --enable-efence  Use the Electric Fence memory allocation debugger  Tectia’s memory allocations can be tracked by Electric Fence, a freely distributable memory allocation debugger created by Bruce Perens. You must have Electric Fence installed on the server machine in order for this to work.  The --enable-efenceflag causes Tectia’s programs to be linked with the Electric Fence library, libefence.a, which provides instrumented versions of malloc  , free   , and other memory-related functions. Electric Fence is available from http:  www.perens. com FreeSoftware .  --with-purify  Use Rational Purify to track memory accesses  Rational Purify is a commercial product that supports tracking of memory accesses at runtime. It is able to detect memory leaks and corruption due to buffer overruns, etc.  The --with-purify flag includes support for Rational Purify. When the Tectia pro- grams run, they produce a report about memory activity that can be analyzed after each program exits.  Rational Purify is available from http:  www.ibm.com software awdtools purify .  4.3.5.10 SSH-1 protocol compatibility  --with-internal-ssh1-compat --without-internal-ssh1-compat  Include SSH-1 protocol support in the client Remove SSH-1 protocol support from the client  The Tectia SSH client can support the older  and deprecated  SSH-1 protocol by run- ning a separate client program named ssh1, which must be installed separately. [5.10] By default, the Tectia SSH client also supports SSH-1 directly using its own imple- mentation. If you don’t use the SSH-1 protocol, use the --without-internal-ssh1- compat option to remove the internal SSH-1 support and save some space in the client.  --with-ssh-agent1-compat --without-ssh-agent1-compat  Include SSH-1 protocol support in the agent Remove SSH-1 protocol support from the agent  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.3 Installing Tectia    121   SSH agents [2.5] that use the protocols SSH-1 and SSH-2 are normally not compati- ble. That is, each version of the agent can’t store keys or forward connections from the other. However, the Tectia agent has an optional feature to serve SSH-1 protocol applications, if it is run with the option -1  that’s a one, not a lowercase L .  SSH-1 protocol support is included in the Tectia agent by default, but you can use the --without-ssh-agent1-compat option to remove it if you never plan to use SSH-1 clients.  RSA support must be included  either by default, or using the --with-rsa configure option  for the agent to support the SSH-1 protocol.  SSH-1 Compatibility Support for Tectia  4.3.6 The Tectia server only supports the SSH-2 protocol, but it can be configured to run a separate SSH-1 server to support clients that are still using the older protocol. [5.10] The Tectia client can similarly run a separate SSH-1 client program, or it can use its own internal SSH-1 implementation.  If separate SSH-1 programs are used, they must be obtained and installed. OpenSSH is a good choice for SSH-1 client support, but for SSH-1 server support, only ver- sions earlier than 3.7 can be used.  An alternative is the latest SSH1 implementation, which is quite old and  even worse  is no longer being actively maintained, but at least is designed to be integrated seam- lessly with Tectia.  To install SSH1, download the tar file and associated signature file from ftp:  ftp.ssh. com pub ssh . At press time, these were ssh-1.2.33.tar.gz and ssh-1.2.33.tar.gz.sig, respectively.  To verify the signature, you also need to download the key, in the file SSH1- DISTRIBUTION-KEY-RSA.asc. Import the key into your key ring:  $ gpg --import SSH1-DISTRIBUTION-KEY-RSA.asc  Then check the integrity of the tar file:  $ gpg --verify ssh-1.2.33.tar.gz.sig  Extract the files from the tar file in the usual way to create a source directory named ssh-1.2.33. [4.1.4]  Run the configure script. We won’t go over its options because they are obsolete for the most part, and because fancy features are presumably not needed  or even desir- able  if SSH1 is only going to be employed as part of a transition strategy until older SSH-1 clients can be upgraded to use SSH-2. You can, however, remove unneeded features to prevent them from being exploited if any security holes are lurking in the code  which becomes increasingly likely as the software continues to age . As usual, see the output from configure --help for details.  122    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You can install SSH1 in the same directory as Tectia using the same configure --prefix option for each. [4.1.5] Finally, compile everything with make, and install  typically as root  with make install. [4.1.6] The following files are installed:    The server program, sshd1, and a link to it called sshd   The clients ssh1 and scp1, and respective links called ssh and scp   The symbolic link slogin1, pointing to ssh1, and likewise a link called slogin  pointing to slogin1    Support programs ssh-add1, ssh-agent1, ssh-askpass1, and ssh-keygen1, and links  to them called ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-askpass, and ssh-keygen, respectively    The support program make-ssh-known-hosts   A newly generated host key pair, created by ssh-keygen1 and placed by default into  etc ssh ssh_host_key  private key  and  etc ssh ssh_host_key.pub  public key     The server configuration file,  etc ssh sshd_config by default [5.2.1]   The client configuration file,  etc ssh ssh_config by default [7.1.2]   Manpages for the various programs  Notice that SSH1 and Tectia create some files with the same names, such as the link sshd. What happens if you install both SSH1 and Tectia on the same machine? Hap- pily, everything works out, even if you install the two products into the same bin and etc directories, provided you install the most recent versions. Each of their Makefiles is constructed to check for the existence of the other version and respond appropriately.*  Specifically, both SSH1 and Tectia create symbolic links called sshd, ssh, scp, ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-askpass, and ssh-keygen. If you install SSH1 and then Tectia, the Tec- tia Makefile renames these files by appending the suffix .old and then creates new symbolic links pointing to its own Tectia programs. For instance, ssh originally points to ssh1; after installing Tectia, ssh points to ssh2, and ssh.old points to ssh1. This is appropriate since Tectia is considered a later version than SSH1.  On the other hand, if you install Tectia and then SSH1, the SSH1 Makefile leaves Tectia’s links untouched. As a result, ssh remains pointing to ssh2, and no link points to ssh1. This is consistent with the practice of installing SSH1 to allow Tectia to pro- vide fallback SSH1 support.  You need to set up the SSH1 configuration files in addition to the Tectia configura- tion files, and then keep them synchronized. [5.10.1]  * Installers for Tectia binary distributions behave the same way when integrating with SSH1 installations.

Replacing r-Commands with SSH  4.5 SSH and the r-commands  rsh, rcp, rlogin  can coexist peacefully on the same machine. Since the r-commands are insecure, however, system administrators should replace them by their SSH counterparts  ssh, scp, slogin . This replacement has two parts:    Installing SSH and removing rsh, rcp, and rlogin; requires some user retraining   Modifying other programs or scripts that invoke the r-commands  The r-commands are so similar to their analogous SSH commands, you might be tempted to rename the SSH commands as the r-commands  e.g., rename ssh as rsh, etc. . After all, common commands like these are practically identical in syntax:  $ rsh -l jones remote.example.com $ ssh -l jones remote.example.com  $ rcp myfile remote.example.com: $ scp myfile remote.example.com:  Why not just rename? Well, the two sets of programs are incompatible in some ways. For example, some old versions of rcp use a different syntax for specifying remote filenames.  In the following sections, we discuss some common Unix programs that invoke the r- commands and how to adapt them to use SSH instead.  Concurrent Versions System  CVS   4.5.1 CVS is a version-control system. It maintains a history of changes to sets of files, and helps coordinate the work of multiple people on the same files. It can use rsh to con- nect to repositories on remote hosts. For example, when you check in a new version of a file:  $ cvs commit myfile  if the repository is located on a remote machine, CVS can invoke rsh to access the remote repository. For a more secure solution, CVS can run ssh instead of rsh. Of  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  4.5 Replacing r-Commands with SSH    125   course, the remote machine must be running an SSH server, and if you use public- key authentication, your remote account must contain your key in the appropriate place.*  To make CVS use ssh, simply set the environment variable CVS_RSH to contain the path to your ssh client:   Bourne shell family  Put in ~ .profile to make permanent. CVS_RSH= usr bin ssh export CVS_RSH   C shell family  Put in ~ .login to make permanent. setenv CVS_RSH  usr bin ssh  This approach has one problem: each time you check in a file, the logger’s name is the remote account owner, which might not be your own. The problem is solved by manually setting the remote LOGNAME variable using the environment option in your remote authorized_keys file. [8.2.5.1]  GNU Emacs  4.5.2 The Emacs variable remote-shell-program contains the path to any desired program for invoking a remote shell. Simply redefine it to be the full path to your ssh execut- able. Also, the rlogin package, rlogin.el, defines a variable rlogin-program you can redefine to use slogin.  Pine  4.5.3 The Pine mail reader uses rsh to invoke mail-server software on remote machines. For example, it might invoke the IMAP daemon, imapd, on a remote mail server. Another program can be substituted for rsh by changing the value of a Pine configu- ration variable, rsh-path. This variable holds the name of the program for opening remote shell connections, normally  usr bin rsh. A new value can be assigned in an individual user’s Pine configuration file, ~ .pinerc, or in the systemwide Pine configu- ration file, typically  usr local lib pine.conf. For example:   Set in a Pine configuration file rsh-path= usr local bin ssh  A second variable, rsh-command, constructs the actual command string to be exe- cuted for the remote mail server. The value is a pattern in the style of the C function printf   . Most likely, you won’t need to change the value because both rsh and ssh fit the default pattern, which is:  "%s %s -l %s exec  etc r%sd"  * CVS also has a remote-access method involving its own server, called pserver. This mechanism can be  secured using SSH port forwarding instead; read Chapter 9 for the general technique.  126    Chapter 4:  Installation and Compile-Time Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The first three “%s” pattern substitutions refer to the rsh-path value, the remote hostname, and the remote username.  The fourth forms the remote mail daemon name, which doesn’t concern us.  So, by default, if your username is alice and the remote mail server is mail.example.com, rsh-command evaluates to:   usr bin rsh mail.example.com -l alice ...  By changing the rsh-path, it becomes instead:   usr local bin ssh mail.example.com -l alice ...  As we said, you probably don’t need to do anything with rsh-command, but just in case, we’ve included it for reference. We present a detailed case study of integrating Pine and SSH later. [11.3]  rsync, rdist  4.5.4 rsync and rdist are software tools for synchronizing sets of files between different directories on the same machine or on two different hosts. Both can call rsh to con- nect to a remote host, and both can easily use SSH instead: simply set the RSYNC_RSH environment variable or use the –e command-line option for rsync, and use the –P option with rdist. rsync with SSH is a particularly simple and effective method to securely maintain remote mirrors of whole directory trees.  Summary  4.6 OpenSSH and Tectia can be tailored in various ways by compile-time configuration with the configure script. We’ve covered the SSH-specific flags, but remember that other operating-system-specific flags might also apply to your installation, so be sure to read the installation notes supplied with the software.  Once installed, SSH software can replace the insecure r-commands on your Unix sys- tem, not only when run directly, but also within other programs that invoke rsh, such as Emacs and Pine.

Which authentication techniques should be permitted? How many bits should the server key contain? Should idle connections be dropped after a time limit or left connected indefinitely? These and other questions must be consid- ered carefully. sshd has reasonable defaults, but don’t accept them blindly. Your server should conform to a carefully planned security policy. Fortunately, sshd is highly configurable, so you can make it do all kinds of interesting tricks.  This chapter covers serverwide configuration, in which a system administrator con- trols the global runtime behavior of the SSH server. This includes a large, rich set of features, such as TCP IP settings, encryption, authentication, access control, and error logging. Some features are controlled by modifying a serverwide configu- ration file, and others by command-line options passed to the server at invocation.  Serverwide configuration is just one of three levels for controlling the behavior of SSH servers. The other two levels are compile-time configuration  Chapter 4 , in which the server is compiled with or without certain functionality; and per-account configuration  Chapter 8 , in which the server’s behavior is modified by end users for their accounts only. We’ll discuss the distinction between the three levels in more detail later. [5.2]  This chapter covers only the OpenSSH and Tectia servers, focusing on the Unix implementations  including Unix variants such as Linux and OpenBSD . We’ve tried to indicate which features are present or absent in each flavor of sshd, but these will certainly change as new versions appear, so read each product’s documentation for the latest information.  * Tectia’s server might also be named sshd2, with sshd being a symbolic link to sshd2. See the upcoming side-  bar “Tectia’s File-Naming Conventions.”  128  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Running the Server  5.1 Ordinarily, an SSH server is invoked when the host computer is booted, and it is left running as a daemon. This works fine for most purposes. Alternatively, you can invoke the server manually. This is helpful when you’re debugging a server, experi- menting with server options, or running a server as a nonsuperuser. Manual invoca- tion requires a bit more work and forethought but might be the only alternative for some situations.  Most commonly, a computer has just one SSH server running on it. It handles multi- ple connections by spawning child processes, one per connection.* You can run mul- tiple servers if you like: for example, two copies of sshd listening on different TCP ports, or even several versions of sshd at once.  Running sshd as the Superuser  5.1.1 The SSH server is invoked by simply typing its name:  $ sshd  The server automatically runs in the background, so no ampersand is required at the end of the line.  To invoke the server when the host computer boots, add appropriate lines to an appropriate startup file on your system, such as  etc rc.local on Linux. For example:   Specify the path to sshd. SSHD= usr local sbin sshd  If sshd exists and is executable, run it and echo success to the system console. if [ -x "$SSHD" ] then   $SSHD && echo 'Starting sshd' fi  Both OpenSSH and Tectia come with a startup or boot script  i.e., a System-V-style init control script  found in the appropriate directory for each Unix variant. For Linux, for example, the scripts are  etc init.d sshd for OpenSSH and  etc init.d sshd2 for Tectia.†  Running sshd as an Ordinary User  5.1.2 Any user can run sshd if several steps are completed beforehand:  1. Get permission from your system administrator. 2. Generate a host key.  * Or sshd can be invoked by inetd, creating one sshd process per connection. [5.3.3.2] † OpenSSH also includes  usr sbin rcsshd, a symbolic link to the startup script in  etc init.d.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.1 Running the Server    129   Tectia’s File-Naming Conventions  At first glance, Tectia’s filenames might seem rather inconsistent, but actually they fol- low conventions designed for flexibility and ease of use:    Most filenames contain a “2” suffix, e.g., sshd2. These filenames distinguish the SSH-2 protocol implementation provided by Tectia from other implementations  e.g., OpenSSH . As a result, you could install SSH-1 protocol programs  not provided by Tectia  with filenames containing a “1” suffix, even in the same directories used by Tectia, without conflicts.    Tectia installs symbolic links so that you can omit the “2” suffix when referring to programs, manpages, etc. For example, there’s a symbolic link sshd pointing to sshd2. You can set up search paths so that Tectia is the preferred implementa- tion, hiding other implementations that might be installed in other directories.    On platforms like Microsoft Windows that don’t support symbolic links, the  program names all have the “2” suffix.  There are a few exceptions:    Configuration files that live  at least by default  in fixed locations use only file- names with the “2” suffix, e.g.,  etc ssh2 or ~ .ssh2, with no corresponding sym- bolic links. This avoids confusing other SSH implementations that refer to similar locations without the “2” suffix  e.g.,  etc ssh or ~ .ssh .    Files unique to Tectia have only filenames that omit the “2” suffix. Strictly speaking, the “2” suffix is unnecessary in this case, but the convention is unfor- tunate, because it sometimes leads to unexpected filename comparisons. For example, the Tectia program for verifying sshd2 configuration files is called sshd- check-conf, even though the default files it checks are named  etc ssh2 sshd2_ config and ~ .ssh2 sshd2_config. [5.2.2]  3. Select a port number. 4. Create a server configuration file  optional but strongly recommended .  Before starting, ask your system administrator if you may run an SSH server. While this isn’t necessary from a technical standpoint, it is a wise idea. An administrator might not appreciate your creating a new avenue for logins behind his back. Like- wise, if the administrator has disabled SSH or certain SSH features, there’s probably a good security reason and you shouldn’t just work around it!  Next, generate your own host key. Any other existing host key is probably readable only by the superuser. Host keys are generated with the program ssh-keygen. [6.2] For now, to create a 1024-bit DSA host key and store it in the file ~ myserver hostkey, type the following for OpenSSH:   OpenSSH: Note the -N value is two single quotes, not a double-quote $ ssh-keygen -N '' -b 1024 -t dsa -f ~ myserver hostkey  130    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This command generates the files hostkey and hostkey.pub in the directory ~ myserver  so make sure the directory exists . Here’s the analogous command for Tectia:   Tectia $ ssh-keygen -P -b 1024 -t dsa ~ myserver hostkey  The –N  OpenSSH  and –P  Tectia  options cause the generated key to be left unen- crypted because sshd expects to read it without a passphrase.  Third, select a port number on which the SSH server listens for connections. The port number is set with the –p command-line option of sshd or the Port keyword in the configuration file, as we discuss later. Your server can’t listen on port 22, the default, because only the superuser may run processes to listen on that port. Your port number must be greater than or equal to 1024, as lower port numbers are reserved by the operating system for use by privileged programs. [3.4.3.6] The port number also must not conflict with those in use by other programs on the server computer; if it does, you get an error message when you try to start the server:  error: bind: Address already in use  If you receive this error, try another integer in the free range  above 1024 . Avoid numbers mentioned in the computer’s services map  usually  etc services or the Net- work Information Service [NIS] “services” map, which you can view with the Unix command ypcat –k services . These numbers have been designated by the system administrator for use with particular programs or protocols, so you might cause trou- ble if you steal one. The command netstat -a lists all ports in use; add the –n option to see numeric values for the ports instead of service names.  Finally, create your own SSH server configuration file. Otherwise, your server will use built-in defaults or a systemwide configuration file  if one exists  and might not operate as you intend.  Assuming you have generated a host key in ~ myserver hostkey, selected the port number 2345, and created a configuration file in ~ myserver config, the server is invoked with the command:  $ sshd -h ~ myserver hostkey -p 2345 -f ~ myserver config A server run by an ordinary user has some disadvantages:    It runs under the uid of the ordinary user, not root, so it can connect only to that  user’s account.    It is invoked manually, rather than automatically when the computer boots. As a result, to run the server, you must connect once without SSH to the computer. And each time the computer is rebooted, the server dies, and you need to redo this step. Conceivably you can set up a cron job to keep it running automatically.   While setting up a server, consider running it in debug mode and reading the diagnostic messages it prints, in case something isn’t working right. By default, your server’s log messages are written to the system log files, which you don’t  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

This is because sshd does its logging via the sys- log service; ordinary users can’t control where the log messages are sent, usually  var adm messages,  var log messages, or someplace else depending on how sys- logd is set up, and you need appropriate permissions to read these files. Running the server in debug mode gets around this annoyance. Messages will appear on your terminal  as well as in the system logs . [5.9] This way, you can more easily see error messages until you get the server working.  Nevertheless, for many users, the advantages of SSH outweigh these inconveniences. Assuming your system administrator approves, you can secure your logins with sshd even if you aren’t a superuser.  Server Conﬁguration: An Overview  5.2 As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the behavior of the server, sshd, may be controlled at three levels:    Compile-time configuration  Chapter 4  is accomplished when sshd is built. For example, a server may be compiled with or without support for rhosts authenti- cation.    Serverwide configuration, the subject of this chapter, is performed by a system administrator and applies to a running instance of the server. For instance, an administrator may deny SSH access by all hosts in a given domain or make the server listen on a particular port. Serverwide configuration may depend on compile-time configuration. For exam- ple, a server’s hostbased authentication options work only if the server is com- piled with hostbased authentication support included. Otherwise, the options have no effect. We identify such dependencies throughout the book. Figure 5-1 highlights the serverwide configuration tasks.    Per-account configuration  Chapter 8  is performed by the end user, specifically, the owner of the account to which an SSH connection has been requested. For example, users may permit or deny access to their own accounts from particular hosts, overriding the serverwide configuration.  Suppose user deborah on the machine client.unc.edu invokes an SSH client. The cli- ent’s behavior is determined by several factors:    The compile-time options selected when the software was built   The machinewide client configuration file on client.unc.edu   User deborah’s own client configuration file   The command-line options used by deborah when invoking the client  An SSH server running on server.unc.edu accepts deborah’s connection to the account charlie. The server’s behavior is determined by the compile-time options used when  132    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

With three levels of server configuration, and multiple entry points for modifying the behavior at each level, things can get complicated. In particular, different options may work together or cancel each other. For example, user charlie can configure his account on server.unc.edu to accept connections from client.unc.edu, while the sys- tem administrator of server.unc.edu can configure the SSH server to reject them.  In this case, Charlie loses.  Administrators must understand not only how to configure the server themselves, but also how their choices interact with compile-time and per- account settings.  Server Conﬁguration Files  5.2.1 Serverwide configuration is accomplished in two ways: through a server configura- tion file, or through command-line options. In a server configuration file, numerous  5.2 Server Configuration: An Overview   133  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   configuration variables, called keywords, may have their values set. For example, to set the TCP port on which the server will listen, a configuration file can contain the line:  Port 1022  Port = 1022  You may also separate the keyword and value by an equals sign  with optional whitespace :  The configuration file is typically  etc ssh sshd_config for OpenSSH or  etc ssh2  sshd2_config for Tectia.* The file contains keywords and their values, as in the Port example, with one pair  keyword and value  per line. Keywords are case-insensitive: Port, port, and PoRt are all treated identically. Comments may appear in the file as well: any line beginning with a hash sign    is a comment:   This is a comment  Comments cannot be appended to keyword lines. For example, the following does not work:  Port 1022     This comment is not allowed here, so don't do this  Empty lines  or lines containing only whitespace  are also ignored as comments.  To use a configuration file other than the default, invoke sshd with the –f command- line option, providing the alternative filename as an argument:  $ sshd -f  usr local ssh my_config  Tectia supports some extensions to configuration files that we cover in a detailed case study: [11.6]  Metaconfiguration information  Structured comments at the top of the server configuration file that define syn- tax rules for the rest of the file. For example, the REGEX-SYNTAX metaconfigura- tion statement selects one of several different regular expression standards: grep style  egrep , filename globbing  zsh_fileglob , and others.  Subconfiguration files  Alternative configuration files specific to particular local accounts or remote hosts. The keywords UserSpecificConfig and HostSpecificConfig define the associations between subconfiguration files and the affected accounts and hosts, respectively. For example, the line:   Tectia UserSpecificConfig smith  usr local ssh smith.config  states that all connection attempts to the smith account must adhere to the con- figuration in file  usr local ssh smith.config.  * On Windows, Tectia’s configuration files are located in the SSH Tectia Server installation folder.  134    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia has unusual rules for quoted strings, namely, that quotes are largely ignored. The following sshd2_config lines are equivalent:  Quoted values   Tectia Port 1022 Port "1022" Port "10"22  Checking Conﬁguration Files  5.2.2 After you’ve changed a server configuration file  or constructed an initial version of the file , how do you know it’s going to work and have the effects you intend? Later, when you upgrade the server to a more recent version, how can you detect incompat- ible changes in the meaning of keywords that you’ve been using?  The most thorough way to verify the server configuration, of course, is to run the server exactly as you plan to deploy it, and test all of the functionality that you expect to use. This kind of testing can be time-consuming, however, and you might not be able to afford interrupting service on a busy production machine.  Alternately, you could use some other test machine, or run the server on a different port [5.3.3.1] while the old configuration is still being used on the original machine. These approaches are almost as good, but they can be complicated if the server con- figuration refers to network characteristics of the machine where it will be deployed, or by firewalls that block access to nonstandard ports.  Both OpenSSH and Tectia have test features to help with these situations, or to just provide a quick check of the server configuration before more rigorous testing.  Checking OpenSSH conﬁguration ﬁles  5.2.2.1 If the OpenSSH server is started with the –t  test  option, it starts up, checks the validity of its host keys and the server configuration file, and then immediately exits without performing any other actions. When no problems are found, the server silently returns a zero exit status to indicate successful operation. Otherwise, error messages are printed to the standard error and the server exits with a nonzero status:   OpenSSH $ sshd -t  etc ssh sshd_config: line 33: Bad configuration option: BlurflPox  etc ssh sshd_config: Bad yes no argument: maybe  The server must be run by a user  typically root  who has read access to the host key files and the server configuration file. Any other server options can be used in con- junction with –t, such as –h options [5.3.1.1] to specify new host key files, the –f option [5.2.1] to specify a new configuration file, or –d options [5.9] for more detailed debugging output  even if no errors are detected .  5.2 Server Configuration: An Overview   135  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Checking Tectia conﬁguration ﬁles  5.2.2.2 Tectia provides a separate program, sshd-check-conf, to check server configuration files.* Supply a hypothetical user and remote host, and sshd-check-conf will describe its access control decisions for them:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf rebecca@client.friendly.org Verifying rebecca@client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3]...   Logins from client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3] allowed.   Hostbased can be used from client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3].   Login by user rebecca allowed.   User rebecca will not be chrooted.   TCP forwarding by user rebecca allowed.  sshd-check-conf is especially helpful for verifying policies described by complicated patterns and subconfiguration files. [11.6.2] It uses the same code as sshd to parse the server configuration files and understands metaconfiguration information. [11.6.1]  If any errors are detected, sshd-check-conf prints messages to the standard error, as sshd would:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf rebecca@client.friendly.org Warning: Unrecognized configuration parameter 'BlurflPox'. Warning: Illegal IdleTimeout value 'never'. Warning: Failed to parse some variables from config file ' etc ssh2 sshd2_config'. FATAL: Failed to read config file " etc ssh2 sshd2_config"  It is not necessary to run sshd-check-config as root, as long as the server configura- tion files can be read. By default,  etc ssh2 sshd2_config is used if the program is run by the superuser, or $HOME .ssh2 sshd2_config otherwise. As for sshd, the –f option specifies a different configuration file:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf -f  tmp sshd2_config_new rebecca@client.friendly.org  The hypothetical SSH sessions are described by one or more [user@]host arguments on the command line. A numerical user ID can be used in place of a username, or the username can be omitted entirely to check only the remote host. In this case, sshd- check-conf substitutes UNKNOWN for the username when it analyzes the access controls:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf client.friendly.org Verifying UNKNOWN@client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3]...   Logins from client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3] allowed.   Hostbased can be used from client.friendly.org[10.1.2.3].   Login by user UNKNOWN denied.  An IP address can be used instead of a hostname: both the hostname and IP address are checked.  * sshd-check-conf doesn’t read or verify host keys.  136    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses, then only the first IP address is used, and a warning is printed by sshd-check-conf.  Here’s a brash one-liner to check the access controls for all local users:   Tectia $ sed -e "s :.* @`hostname` "  etc passwd  xargs sshd-check-conf  You can also run sshd-check-conf interactively: just don’t supply any [user@]host arguments on the command line. The program prompts for [user@]host strings, per- mits Emacs-style editing of the strings as you enter them  using the GNU readline library , and maintains a history of previously entered values.  In addition, sshd-check-conf recognizes a dump command to print keywords and val- ues for the server configuration:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf ... ssh-check-conf> dump  General Port = 22 ProtocolVersionString = 4.1.3.2 SSH Secure Shell MaxConnections = 0 ...  Authentication and authorization AllowedAuthentications = publickey,password IgnoreRhosts = no ...  Forwardings ForwardX11 = yes ForwardAgent = yes ...  Miscellaneous user setup UserConfigDirectory = %D .ssh2 PrintMOTD = yes ... sshd-check-conf> quit $  Tectia’s sshd-check-conf dump command prints most configuration keywords and values, but not all of them.  To exit from interactive mode, use the quit command, or type the end-of-file charac- ter  usually ^D , or just kill the program  typically with ^C . The quit and dump com- mands are case-insensitive.  5.2 Server Configuration: An Overview   137  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Because sshd-check-conf matches patterns for subconfiguration files [11.6.2], it reads the main configuration file only when a [user@]host string has been given. Therefore, the dump command can’t be used before then:  Tectia $ sshd-check-conf sshd-check-conf> dump No config data to dump; input   first.  The sshd-check-conf program accepts the debug options –d and –v [5.9] to print more detailed debugging information as it reads the configuration files and analyzes access control decisions.  Command-Line Options  5.2.3 Additionally, when invoking the server, you may supply command-line options. For example, the port value may be specified on the command line with the –p option:  $ sshd -p 1022  Command-line options override settings in the configuration file. Thus, if the config- uration file says port 1022 but the server is invoked with –p 2468, the port used will be 2468.  Most command-line options duplicate the features found in the configuration file, for convenience, while a few provide unique functionality. For instance, the –f option instructs sshd to use a different configuration file, a feature that’s useless to put in a configuration file.  On the other hand, most keywords don’t have command-line equivalents. However, the –o option lets you specify any keyword and its value on the command line; for example, to set the TCP port number by this method:  The argument for the –o option should be a keyword and value, exactly as specified in the configuration file.* An equals sign  with optional whitespace  can also be used:  You can omit the quotes if you avoid characters special to the shell  including the whitespace around the equals sign :  You can repeat the -o option to set values for multiple keywords on the same com- mand line.  $ sshd -o "Port 1022"  $ sshd -o "Port = 1022"  $ sshd -o Port=1022  * Except for comments, which will not work, e.g., sshd -o " Your message here". But this would be silly.  138    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia servers always use the default egrep syntax for regular expres- sions on the command line. Unlike configuration files, command-line options have no way to change this via metaconfiguration, e.g., for -o options.  Command-line options can be repeated, but the effects of such repetition vary and even differ depending on the server implementation. In almost all cases, only the last repeated option is used, and all earlier instances of the same option are  silently  ignored. For example, an attempt to read two configuration files:  $ sshd -f  usr local ssh main.conf -f  usr local ssh alt.conf Beware! Does not read both files!  will actually read only alt.conf and ignore main.conf.  The “last option wins” rule can be handy for scripting. Suppose you launch the server from a shell script called launch-sshd:   launch-sshd: sshd -f  usr local ssh main.conf "$@"  Since the $@ is replaced by options from the command line, you can substitute a dif- ferent configuration file when using the script:  $ launch-sshd -f  usr local ssh alt.conf  We have seen that the –o option is an exception: it can be repeated to set values for as many keywords as needed. There are only a few other exceptions, all for OpenSSH. The –p option can be repeated to listen on multiple ports: [5.3.3.1]   OpenSSH $ sshd -p 2222 -p 3333  The –h option can be used multiple times to specify different types of host keys in separate files: [5.3.1.1]   OpenSSH $ sshd -h  usr local ssh my_dsa_key -h  usr local ssh my_rsa_key -h  usr local ssh  my_old_ssh1_key  Repeating the –d option increases the level of verbosity for debugging: [5.9]   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -d -d  Tectia is more consistent than OpenSSH: it always uses the last instance of each option on the command line.  Changing the Conﬁguration  5.2.4 sshd reads its configuration file at startup. Therefore, if you modify the file while the server is running, the changes don’t affect the server. You must force the server to  5.2 Server Configuration: An Overview   139  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   reread the file in order to accept the changes. This is done by sending a SIGHUP signal to the server process. The pid of the server is found in a file, usually  var run  sshd.pid for OpenSSH or  var run sshd2_22.pid for Tectia. [5.3.1.3]  Suppose the pid file is  var run sshd.pid, the default for OpenSSH. To send the SIGHUP signal, run the Unix kill command:  $ cat  etc sshd.pid 19384 $ kill -HUP 19384  or more succinctly, with backquotes:  $ kill -HUP `cat  etc sshd.pid`  or on systems with the pidof command, which prints pids of given, named processes:  Linux systems  and others  have boot scripts that can signal the SSH server. For example, instead of explicitly sending SIGHUP to sshd, you can run:  $ kill -HUP `pidof sshd`  $  etc init.d sshd reload  Regardless of how it’s sent, the SIGHUP signal restarts sshd  with a different pid  but doesn’t terminate existing SSH connections, so you can send it safely while clients are connected. The new sshd process reads and conforms to the new configuration.  The SIGHUP technique affects settings defined in the configuration file, not com- mand-line options. To change those, you must kill and restart the server with the new options. For example:  $ kill 19384 $ sshd new_options  Command-line options are often specified in boot scripts that are used to start sshd. For example, some Linux systems read an OPTIONS variable assignment from the file  etc sysconfig sshd  if it exists . You may need to edit such options files if you want to permanently change the command-line options used to start the SSH server at boot time. After doing this, you can use the boot script to restart the server with the new command-line options:  $  etc init.d sshd restart  Boot scripts can perform other useful functions. To determine whether the SSH server is running, use:  $  etc init.d sshd status  To start or stop the server, use:  $  etc init.d sshd start $  etc init.d sshd stop  140    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Some configuration keywords refer to external files. If the contents of those files change, you might wonder if it is necessary to signal the SSH server. In almost all cases, the answer is no: only the filenames are recorded when the configuration file is read, and the external file’s contents are reread each time they are needed. The host key file is an important exception, because it is normally read only when the server starts. [5.3.1.1]  A Tricky Reconﬁguration Example  5.2.5 Because command-line options override their configuration file equivalents, some interesting situations can arise. Suppose the configuration file sets the TCP port number to be 2222:  Port 2222  $ sshd -p 3333  but the server is invoked with the –p command-line option, overriding this value with 3333:  The server uses TCP port 3333. Now, suppose you restart sshd with SIGHUP:  $ kill -HUP `pidof sshd`  forcing sshd to reread the configuration file. What do you think happens to the port number? Does the server use port 2222 after rereading the configuration file, or does the command-line option remain in effect for port 3333? In fact, the command-line option takes precedence again, so port 3333 is reused. sshd saves its argument vec- tor* and reapplies it on restart.  Getting Ready: Initial Setup  5.3 We now embark on a detailed discussion of SSH server configuration, using both keywords and command-line options. Please keep in mind that modern SSH prod- ucts are actively developed and their features may change. Be sure to read their docu- mentation for the latest information.  We begin with initial setup decisions, such as: where should important files be kept? What should their permissions be? What TCP IP settings should be used? Which encryption algorithms should be supported?  * argv, to C programmers.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    141   File Locations  5.3.1 sshd expects certain files to exist, containing the server’s host key, the random seed, and other data. The server looks for these files in default locations, or you may over- ride them with keywords and command-line options as described later.  Although you may place these files anywhere you like, we strongly recommend keep- ing them on a local disk on your server machine, not on a remotely mounted disk  e.g., via NFS . This is for security reasons, as NFS will gleefully transmit your sensitive files unencrypted across the network. This would be especially disastrous for the unen- crypted private host key!  As a running example, we use an invented directory,  usr local ssh, as our preferred  nondefault  location for the SSH server’s files.  5.3.1.1 Host key ﬁles The host key of sshd uniquely identifies a server to SSH clients. The host key is stored in a pair of files, one containing the private key and the other the public key. OpenSSH has distinct host keys in DSA   etc ssh ssh_host_dsa_key  and RSA   etc  ssh ssh_host_rsa_key  formats, as well as a legacy SSH-1 protocol key,  etc ssh ssh_ host_key. These private keys are readable only by privileged programs such as the SSH server and clients. Their locations may be changed with the HostKey keyword:*   OpenSSH HostKey  usr local ssh my_dsa_key HostKey  usr local ssh my_rsa_key HostKey  usr local ssh my_old_ssh1_key  Each private key has a corresponding public key, stored in a second file with the same name but with .pub appended. So, in the above example, the public keys would be  usr local ssh my_dsa_key.pub,  usr local ssh my_rsa_key.pub, and  usr local ssh  my_old_ssh1_key.pub.  For Tectia, the default private key file is  etc ssh2 hostkey if the server is run by the superuser or ~ .ssh2 hostkey if run by any other user. To specify a different private key file, use the HostKeyFile keyword:   Tectia HostKeyFile  usr local ssh key  The server’s public key file, normally  etc ssh2 hostkey.pub for superusers or ~ .ssh2  hostkey.pub for others, may be changed independently with the PublicHostKeyFile keyword:   Tectia PublicHostKeyFile  usr local ssh pubkey  * HostKey has the aliases HostRsaKey and HostDsaKey, but they are deprecated and might be removed in a future  version of OpenSSH.  142    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If you prefer command-line options, sshd supports the –h command-line option to specify the private key file:  $ sshd -h  usr local ssh key  Once again, the public key filename is derived by appending .pub to the private key filename, in this case,  usr local ssh key.pub.  OpenSSH allows each type of host key to be specified with a separate –h option  and detects the type of each key automatically :   OpenSSH $ sshd -h  usr local ssh my_dsa_key -h  usr local ssh my_rsa_key -h  usr local ssh  my_old_ssh1_key  For Tectia, if the –h option is repeated, only the last file is used and all earlier –h options are ignored. This is consistent with its usual behavior with command-line options. [5.2.3]  Random seed ﬁle  5.3.1.2 The SSH server generates pseudo-random numbers for cryptographic operations. [3.6.4] It maintains a pool of random data for this purpose, derived either from the operating system if provided  e.g.,  dev random on Linux  or from various bits of changing machine state  e.g., clock time, statistics on resource use by processes, etc. . This pool is called the random seed.  If running on a system with a random-bit source, such as  dev urandom, OpenSSH doesn’t create a random seed file. Tectia stores a random seed in  etc ssh2 random_ seed, and the location may be overridden with the RandomSeedFile keyword:   Tectia RandomSeedFile  usr local ssh seed2  Process ID ﬁle  5.3.1.3 The OpenSSH server’s pid is stored in  var run sshd.pid, and you can override this location with the PidFile keyword:   OpenSSH PidFile  usr local ssh pid  OpenSSH doesn’t record the process ID when it runs in debug mode. [5.9]  There is no corresponding keyword for Tectia. Its pid file is always named  var run  sshd2_N.pid, or if there is no  var run directory,  etc ssh2 sshd2_N.pid, where N is the TCP port number of the server.* Since the default port is 22, the default pid file is sshd2_22.pid. If multiple sshd2 processes are run simultaneously on different ports of  * More precisely, N is the value for the Port keyword, even if ListenAddress keywords cause the server to use  different ports. [5.3.3.1]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    143   the same machine, their pid files can be distinguished by this naming convention. The directory used to store pid files can be changed by the configure option --with- piddir. [4.3.5.1]  Server conﬁguration ﬁle  5.3.1.4 The server configuration file is normally  etc ssh sshd_config for OpenSSH and  etc  ssh2 sshd2_config for Tectia. An alternative configuration file can be specified with the –f command-line option:  $ sshd -f  usr local ssh config  This is useful when testing a new server configuration: create a new file and instruct sshd to read it. It is also necessary if you are running multiple sshds on the same machine and want them to operate with different configurations.  Only a single configuration file is read. If you provide multiple –f options, the last one is used and all others are ignored.  5.3.1.5 User SSH directory Tectia’s sshd expects a user’s SSH-related files to be in the directory ~ .ssh2 by default, but this can be changed with the UserConfigDirectory keyword.  OpenSSH has no such capability.  The directory name may be literal, as in:   Tectia UserConfigDirectory  usr local ssh my_dir  or it may be specified with printf-like patterns, as in:   Tectia UserConfigDirectory %D .my-ssh  The %D pattern expands to the user’s home directory. So, the preceding example expands to ~ .my-ssh. The following table shows the available patterns:  Pattern %D  %U  %IU  %IG  Meaning User’s home directory User’s login name User’s uid  Unix user ID  User’s gid  Unix group ID   If the % character is followed by any other characters, it is left unchanged.*  For the system administrator, the UserConfigDirectory keyword provides a quick way to override all users’ Tectia preferences. Specifically, you can cause sshd to  * You need not double the percent sign  %%  to get a literal percent character, i.e., as required for the C function  printf.  144    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ignore everybody’s ~ .ssh2 directories, substituting your own instead. For instance, the line:   Tectia UserConfigDirectory  usr sneaky ssh %U  tells sshd to seek the preferences for each user in  usr sneaky ssh   instead of ~ .ssh2. This powerful feature can also be misused if your machine is compro- mised. If an intruder inserted the following line into sshd2_config:   Tectia UserConfigDirectory  tmp hack  and uploaded his own public key file into  tmp hack, he would gain SSH access to every user’s account.  Per-account authorization ﬁles  5.3.1.6 The OpenSSH server expects to find a user’s public-key authorization file in ~ .ssh  authorized_keys. This location can be changed with the AuthorizedKeysFile key- word, followed by the new location:   OpenSSH AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh permitted_keys  Filenames can be absolute or are relative to the user’s home directory. Additionally, the location can contain a few special symbols: %h to mean the user’s home direc- tory, %u for the username, or %% for a percent sign. So, when user smith authenti- cated on a server machine with this line in  etc ssh sshd_config:   OpenSSH AuthorizedKeysFile  usr local access %u  the authorization filename would expand to  usr local access smith.  The Tectia server uses a different key file layout than OpenSSH. [6.1.2] Its authoriza- tion file, normally ~ .ssh2 authorization, contains names of separate public key files, rather than the keys themselves. sshd can be instructed to find the authorization file elsewhere via the keyword AuthorizationFile:   Tectia AuthorizationFile my_public_keys  Filenames can be absolute or are relative to each user’s Tectia configuration  .ssh2  directory. The preceding example specifies the file ~ .ssh2 my_public_keys.  utmp ﬁle structure  5.3.1.7 The utmp file  e.g.,  var run utmp  contains information about users currently logged in, such as their username, tty, and most notably for us, the hostname from which they’ve logged in  for remote logins . OpenSSH’s sshd can limit the length of host- name information written to the utmp file.  It’s inspired by a similar feature in the telnet daemon telnetd.   This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    145    OpenSSH $ sshd -u 25  Limit hostnames to 25 characters or less  If a remote hostname is longer than this limit, the host’s IP address will be written instead. Why is this useful? For two reasons:    Hostnames longer than the default length—which may vary on different sys- tems—will normally be truncated in the utmp file. While you cannot increase the utmp length with the –u option, you can notify sshd of the length limitation so that IP addresses get used in place of long hostnames. This way, you’ll accu- rately record the host’s identity. See  usr include utmp.h to learn the length limit for your system.    If you specify -u0, IP addresses will always be used in place of hostnames. This has the side effect of forcing sshd not to make DNS requests for these hostname lookups.  It will not entirely suppress DNS, however, since it might be needed for authentication.   File Permissions  5.3.2 As security products, OpenSSH and Tectia require certain files and directories on the server machine to be protected from unwanted access. Imagine if your authorized_ keys or .rhosts file were world-writable; anyone on that host could modify them and gain convenient access to your account. sshd has several configuration keywords for reducing this risk.  Acceptable permissions for user ﬁles  5.3.2.1 Users aren’t always careful to protect important files and directories in their accounts, such as their .rhosts file or personal SSH directory. Such lapses can lead to security holes and compromised accounts. To combat this, you can configure sshd to reject connections to any user account that has unacceptable permissions.  The StrictModes keyword, with a value of yes  the default , causes sshd to check the permissions of important files and directories. They must be owned by the account owner or by root, and group and world write permission must be disabled. For OpenSSH, StrictModes checks:    The user’s home directory   The user’s ~ .rhosts and ~ .shosts file   The user’s SSH configuration directory, ~ .ssh   The user’s SSH ~ .ssh authorized_keys file   The user and system “known hosts” files  For Tectia, the list is smaller and is checked only for hostbased authentication: [3.4.3.6]  146    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     The user’s home directory   The user’s ~ .rhosts and ~ .shosts file  If any check fails, the server rejects SSH connection attempts to the account. If StrictModes is given the value no, these checks aren’t performed:  StrictModes no  However, we strongly suggest you leave these checks enabled.  Tectia recognizes an undocumented keyword, StrictModes.UserDirMaskBits, to con- trol the checks more precisely. The value is an octal number representing the file per- mission bits that must be disabled. For example, to require that files grant no group or world access  read, write, or execute :   Tectia StrictModes.UserDirMaskBits 077  The default value is 022, indicating that group and world write permission must be disabled.  Even if StrictModes is enabled, it can be defeated by using POSIX access control lists  ACLs , which are supported in Solaris and some other flavors of Unix, to set file permissions with greater precision. sshd doesn’t check ACLs, so one could argue that StrictModes is an incomplete test.  Boolean Values in Conﬁguration Files  Many keywords, such as StrictModes, require Boolean values. OpenSSH and Tectia have different standards for these values. OpenSSH recognizes either yes or true to enable the behavior described by a keyword, as well as the opposite values no or false to disable. These values cannot be abbrevi- ated, and must be lowercase. Tectia is much more lenient: it recognizes any word starting with the letters y  yes , t  true , or k  kyllä: Finnish for “yes”  in lowercase or uppercase to enable, and anything else to disable. We use yes and no in our examples because they are accepted by both products, and we recommend you do the same.  TCP IP Settings  5.3.3 Since the SSH protocol operates over TCP IP, sshd permits control over various parameters related to TCP IP.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    147   Port number and network interface  5.3.3.1 By default, sshd listens on TCP port 22. The port number may be changed with the Port keyword:  or the –p command-line option:  Port 9876  $ sshd -p 9876   OpenSSH $ sshd -p 22 -p 9876  If you repeat the Port keyword or –p option, OpenSSH listens on all of the specified ports:  Tectia, on the other hand, allows only a single port setting: if multiple Port key- words or –p options are specified, the server uses only the last one and ignores all earlier instances.*  You may also configure sshd to bind its listening port on a particular network inter- face. By default, the port is bound on all active network interfaces on the host. The ListenAddress keyword limits sshd to listen only on specific interfaces; the default value is 0.0.0.0.  For example, suppose a computer has two Ethernet cards and is attached to two dif- ferent networks. One interface has the address 192.168.10.23, and the other, 192. 168.11.17. By default, sshd listens on both interfaces; therefore, you can reach the server by connecting to port 22 at either address. However, this may not always be what you want; perhaps you want to provide SSH service only to hosts on one net- work and not the other:  ListenAddress 192.168.10.23  Of course, this represents a real restriction only if the two networks aren’t otherwise connected together  say, by a router  so that port 22 on 192.168.10.23 is not reach- able from the network 192.168.11.24.  To listen on multiple, specific interfaces, repeat the ListenAddress keyword:  ListenAddress 192.168.10.23 ListenAddress 192.168.11.17  For even more precise control, you can also specify the port for listening on a given interface. The syntax differs for OpenSSH and Tectia:   OpenSSH ListenAddress 192.168.11.17:12345 Port 12345. Notice the colon between the address and the port.   Tectia ListenAddress 192.168.11.17 12345  Port 12345. Notice the space between the address and the port.  * The port setting  either explicit or the default value, 22  is used in the name of the process ID file. [5.3.1.3]  Tectia servers can listen on multiple ports, but this requires use of the ListenAddress keyword.  148    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Numeric Values in Conﬁguration Files  OpenSSH accepts numeric values in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, using standard C language notation. If a value begins with 0x, it is treated as hexadecimal. If it begins with a leading zero, it is considered octal. Any other numeric value is read as decimal. Tectia, in contrast, requires all numbers to be given in decimal, except for StrictModes. UserDirMaskBits, which uses an octal value.  The address 0.0.0.0 means to listen on all interfaces:  ListenAddress 0.0.0.0  optionally qualified by a port number:   OpenSSH ListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9876   Tectia ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 9876   OpenSSH ListenAddress :9876  OpenSSH servers allow the address to be omitted  meaning all interfaces  if the port is specified:  For OpenSSH, a ListenAddress of 0.0.0.0:2222 will listen on port 2222 only on IPv4 interfaces, whereas :2222 means to listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Additionally, you can specify IPv6 addresses with colons, but to avoid ambiguity between the address and the port specification, enclose the IPv6 part in square brackets, e.g., ListenAddress [::1]:2222.  Tectia servers recognize the address any for all interfaces, with or without a port:   Tectia ListenAddress any ListenAddress any 9876  Since Tectia uses only a single Port value, the only way to configure the server to lis- ten on multiple ports is to use multiple ListenAddress keywords.  OpenSSH also permits hostnames in place of numeric addresses:  ListenAddress server.example.com  If the hostname lookup yields multiple addresses, then they are all used.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    149   If a ListenAddress value has no port specified, then the value  or possi- bly multiple values, for OpenSSH  of the Port keyword is used for that address. In such a case, the Port keyword s  must precede that ListenAddress keyword. Additionally, the –p command-line option overrides all Port and ListenAddress keywords in the configuration file. The server listens on all interfaces if any –p options are used. Use one or several –o options with the ListenAddress keyword to indicate specific interfaces on the command line.  Invocation by inetd or xinetd  5.3.3.2 sshd normally runs as a daemon, listening for incoming connection requests, and forking whenever it accepts a connection from a client. This spawns a separate child process  a copy of the parent sshd process  to handle each session. The child process exits when the session ends. Alternatively, the server may be invoked by inetd or xinetd, like many other network daemons. In this case, the general-purpose network daemon listens for and accepts the SSH connections. It then starts a new instance of sshd for each session with the already-connected socket attached to the standard input, output, and error streams of sshd. Each sshd invocation is responsible for a single session. If you prefer this behavior, place an appropriate line in the inetd or xinetd configura- tion file to describe the SSH service, invoking sshd with the –i command-line option. For inetd, add a single line to  etc inetd.conf:  ssh stream  tcp     nowait  root   usr local sbin sshd     sshd -i Or if you’re using xinetd, create a new file  etc xinetd.d ssh containing:  service ssh {         socket_type = stream         protocol    = tcp         wait        = no         user        = root         server      =  usr local sbin sshd         server_args = -i         disable     = no }  You will also need an entry for SSH in the server machine’s TCP IP services data- base, usually  etc services  or sometimes  etc inet services , such as:  ssh    22 tcp     SSH Remote Login Protocol  The –i option causes sshd to:    Ignore all Port and ListenAddress keywords and the –p command-line option,  because inetd or xinetd itself is responsible for listening     OpenSSH only  Ignore all MaxStartups keywords  150    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.      OpenSSH only  Direct debug output to syslog [5.9] instead of the standard error stream, since stderr is attached to the SSH socket by inetd or xinetd, and debug output would confuse the SSH client at the other end of the connection  The inetd xinetd approach has advantages and disadvantages. On the up side, it allows a wrapper program to invoke sshd, should that be needed, and xinetd particu- larly supports many options that can complement the SSH server configuration. Also, inetd and xinetd provide a single, centralized point of control for all types of network connections, which simplifies maintenance. If you want to forbid all types of TCP IP connections, for example, you can simply disable inetd xinetd instead of running around killing other daemons. On systems where SSH connections are rare, using inetd xinetd for the SSH service saves resources  memory and a process slot  otherwise consumed by the SSH server as it listens for incoming connections. Finally, starting a new sshd instance for each connection can make attacks more difficult by introducing additional randomness. On the down side, inetd xinetd-based SSH con- nections may be slower to start up.*  Restarting the SSH server for each connection  5.3.3.3 SSH servers use randomness extensively for cryptographic algorithms and protocols, typically relying on the operating system  or other external state  to provide a source of random bits. [3.6.4] Some operating systems also support Address Space Layout Randomization  ASLR , which protects against certain kinds of attacks that require knowledge of predictable memory locations. ASLR causes random offsets to be used when program segments or shared libraries are loaded, memory regions are dynami- cally allocated, etc. Most of the randomness introduced by ASLR occurs when a program is initially loaded and starts running. Even on systems without ASLR, dynamic memory alloca- tions that primarily occur in the early stages of program execution can be affected by the global state of the system’s virtual memory, which is hard to predict. In contrast, when a long-running program merely forks to create many child processes, all of the children inherit the memory layout  and even contents  from the parent process. Restarting the child processes after each fork mitigates the risks associated with attacks that are based on guessing memory locations. By default, the OpenSSH server restarts itself after it accepts each connection from a client, and forks to create a separate child process to handle the session.† Relative pathnames can’t be used for server restarts, since sshd changes its working directory shortly after it begins running:   OpenSSH $ . sshd sshd re-exec requires execution with an absolute path  * Only if you use the SSH-1 protocol, where sshd generates a new server key each time it’s invoked. But you’re  not using SSH-1, are you?  † This feature is new in OpenSSH 3.9.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    151   We’ll continue to use the relative pathname “sshd” for our examples as an abbreviation, since the full, absolute pathname usually isn’t rele- vant to our discussions about the sshd command line. Nevertheless, an absolute pathname is recommended in practice, and newer versions of OpenSSH now enforce this, as shown in the preceding example.  If the server restart fails for some other reason  e.g., the executable file used origi- nally to start sshd was renamed or removed , then the child process continues to run after forking, but produces a warning  which is usually sent to syslog :  error: rexec of  usr sbin sshd failed: No such file or directory  Before it restarts, the child process adds the undocumented –R option at the end of its command line: this is used by the new process to detect that it has been restarted, and should therefore use the already connected socket that it inherits from its parent for communication with the client.* The parent process  i.e., the one that listens for incoming connections  sends a copy of its configuration and the SSH-1 server key  if one is used  via another socket to the restarted child process, which knows to read the data because of the same –R option. The child process then proceeds to handle the session normally.  If OpenSSH is started by inetd or xinetd, then there is no need to restart the SSH server, because a new instance of sshd is started by inetd xinetd for each connection. [5.3.3.2] In fact, the function of the restarted child process is so similar to the opera- tion of the server with inetd xinetd that the –R option enables the same side effects as the –i option: notably, debug output is forced to syslog instead of the standard error.  The restart mechanism can be disabled by the undocumented, lowercase –r option:   OpenSSH $ sshd -r  This is useful in conjunction with server debugging features, since restarts are an inconvenient complication, and the side effect of sending debug output to syslog after the child process restarts is undesirable. [5.9] The –r option can also be used to avoid the slight performance cost for server restarts, especially on systems without ASLR, where such restarts provide little or no additional randomness. There is no configuration option to disable the server restart feature at build time.  Keepalive messages  5.3.3.4 The keepalive feature  TCPKeepAlive in OpenSSH, KeepAlive in Tectia  is concerned with recognizing when a connection has failed. Suppose a client establishes an SSH connection, and sometime later, the client host crashes abruptly. If the SSH server  * Never use the –R option to start sshd; it’s really part of the protocol for communication between the parent  and the  restarted  child server processes.  152    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   has no reason to send unsolicited messages to the client, it may never notice the half- dead TCP connection to its partner, and the sshd remains around indefinitely, using up system resources such as memory and a process slot  and making the sysadmin’s ps output messy .  The TCPKeepAlive or KeepAlive keyword instructs sshd how to proceed if a connec- tion problem occurs, such as a prolonged network outage or a client machine crash:   OpenSSH TCPKeepAlive yes  Tectia KeepAlive yes  The value yes  the default  tells the server to set the TCP keepalive option on its con- nection to the client. This causes TCP to transmit and expect periodic keepalive mes- sages. If it doesn’t receive responses to these messages for a while, it returns an error to sshd, which then shuts down the connection.  The value no means not to use keepalive messages. Note that SSH clients can also enable keepalive messages from their side of the connections, so it’s important to dis- able those too if you want to avoid keepalive traffic completely. [7.4.5.4]  The TCP keepalive feature is intended to prevent half-dead connections from build- ing up over time. The keepalive message interval and timeout period reflect this: they are quite long, typically on the order of hours. This is to minimize the network load imposed by the keepalive messages and also to prevent connections from being unnecessarily torn down because of transient problems, such as a temporary net- work outage or routing flap. These timers aren’t set in SSH; they are properties of the host’s TCP stack. They shouldn’t be altered lightly, since they affect every TCP con- nection using keepalives on that host.  This feature isn’t intended to prevent lost connections due to firewall, proxying, NAT, or IP masquerading timeouts. For instance, when your SSH connection is going across a firewall but has been idle for a while, the firewall can decide to tear down the connection. Since this is done to conserve shared resources  such as a lim- ited pool of external, routable IP addresses , these timeouts are typically quite short, perhaps a few minutes to an hour or so. The name “keepalive” suggests that it might be the right thing to use, since that’s what you want to do—keep your connection alive. But really, “keepalive” is the wrong name for it; it would be better named “detect dead”  but that sounds like a second-level cleric spell to avoid being eaten by zombies . To deal with this problem, you’d have to shorten the TCP keepalive inter- val dramatically on the SSH host. This is contrary to its purpose and unwise because it affects not only SSH connections, but also every other TCP connection using keep- alives, even those that don’t need it. Doing this on the server side is an especially bad idea as a general principle, since a busy server may be using lots of TCP connections, and enabling keepalives on many of them since it’s supposed to be an inexpensive  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    153   feature. This can impose an unnecessary and damaging additional network load, especially if it becomes a widespread practice.  It’s good to remember that the timeout annoying you so much is there for a reason. You might like to leave an unused SSH connection up for a long time, but if it’s occupying one of a limited number of simultaneous outbound Internet TCP connec- tions for your company, perhaps it’s better if you just suck it up for the common good. Typing ssh again once in a while is really not that hard; use your shell’s alias feature if you find the number of keystrokes onerous. If you genuinely think the timeout is inappropriate or unnecessary, argue the case with the network administra- tor, and try to get it changed.  For the occasions when it’s really necessary, the right way to accomplish this sort of keepalive behavior is with an application-level mechanism implemented in SSH— having it periodically send SSH protocol messages over the connection to make it appear nonidle. This is exactly what OpenSSH does with its ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax keywords. ClientAliveInterval controls how the server sends client-alive messages.* Its argument is a length of time in seconds:   OpenSSH ClientAliveInterval 300  or a time value with optional units:  Send client-alive every 300 seconds, or five minutes   OpenSSH ClientAliveInterval 5m  Send client-alive every five minutes  If your server hasn’t heard from the client within the given amount of time, the server will send a client-alive message to the client. It will continue sending these messages at the given interval  in this case, every five minutes  until it receives a response or gives up. You control how it gives up with the third keyword, ClientAliveCountMax, representing the maximum number of consecutive client-alive messages the server will send:   OpenSSH ClientAliveCountMax 8  Try eight times, then give up. The default is three times.  Once this maximum is reached, the server considers the SSH connection inactive and terminates it. If you don’t want the server to send client-alive messages, set ClientAliveInterval to zero.  If your SSH implementation has no similar feature  Tectia doesn’t , we recommend simply sending characters over your connection once in a while. Run Emacs with a clock in its mode line. Run a program in the background that prints “Boo!” to your terminal if it’s been idle for 20 minutes. You get the idea.  * OpenSSH clients have analogous ServerAliveInterval and ServerAliveCountMax keywords. [7.4.5.4]  154    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Time Values in Conﬁguration Files  Some keywords specify intervals of time. By default, the values are numbers of seconds, but both OpenSSH and Tectia recognize single-character suffixes for units, in either lowercase or uppercase: s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, d for days, and w for weeks. For example, one day could be represented as 1d or 24H or 1440m. OpenSSH adds sequences of time values, so a 90-minute interval can be specified as 1h30m. Tectia allows only a single time-unit suffix. OpenSSH recognizes time values with units for the keywords ClientAliveInterval, LoginGraceTime, and KeyRegenerationTime. Unfortunately, Tectia handles time values rather inconsistently. Units are recognized only for the keywords IdleTimeout, HostkeyEKTimeOut, and ExternalMapperTimeout. Other keywords that specify intervals accept only numbers of seconds, without units: LoginGraceTime, AuthInteractiveFailureTimeout, and RekeyIntervalSeconds  which is especially unusual, since the time unit “seconds” is in the keyword name .  Idle connections  5.3.3.5 Keepalive messages are concerned with recognizing that a connection has failed. A related feature is recognizing when a healthy connection is unused and should be ter- minated. Tectia supports the IdleTimeout keyword for this purpose. If an SSH con- nection is established between a server and a client, but no data passes over the connection for a long time, what should the server do: keep the connection, or termi- nate it?  The IdleTimeout keyword tells the server what to do if a connection is idle, i.e., if the user doesn’t transmit any data in a given period. If IdleTimeout is zero  the default , the server does nothing, leaving idle connections intact:  Otherwise, the server terminates the connection after a specified interval of idleness. The time value can specify units, e.g., three hours:   Tectia IdleTimeout 0   Tectia IdleTimeout 3H  See the sidebar “Time Values in Configuration Files” for more syntax details.  The idle timeout can also be set for a given key in a user’s authorized_keys file using the idle-timeout option. this option overrides the server’s IdleTimeout value but only for that key. This is a rare instance of a per-account option overriding a serverwide option; however, the server will only allow a client to decrease the timeout.  [8.2.7] Notably,  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

The keywords and PasswordGuesses  Tectia  control the server’s response.  LoginGraceTime,   OpenSSH ,  MaxAuthTries  Users are given a limited time to authenticate successfully. The default is 120 sec- onds  2 minutes  for OpenSSH or 600 seconds  10 minutes  for Tectia. This time- out is controlled by the LoginGraceTime keyword, given a value in seconds:  OpenSSH allows time units to be used in the configuration file or on the command line:  LoginGraceTime 60  or the –g command-line option:  $ sshd -g 60   OpenSSH LoginGraceTime 5m   OpenSSH $ sshd -g 5m  LoginGraceTime 0  or by command-line option:  $ sshd -g 0  To disable this feature, provide a LoginGraceTime value of zero:  OpenSSH ignores LoginGraceTime in debug mode. [5.9]  OpenSSH limits the number of times  six by default  that a user can attempt to authenticate in a single SSH connection:   OpenSSH MaxAuthTries 4  Permit four attempts, and log the third and fourth failures if they occur  If authentication fails half the number of times specified  in this example, two times, half of four , then failures are logged by sshd. In other words, sshd gives you the ben- efit of the doubt at first, then considers you suspicious. By default, you have six chances to authenticate in one connection.  If password authentication is used for a connection request, Tectia’s sshd permits a client three tries to authenticate before dropping the connection. This restriction may be modified with the PasswordGuesses keyword for Tectia:   Tectia PasswordGuesses 5  156    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   There are two sorts of requests a client can make in this regard: a query whether a particular public key is authorized to log into the target account, and an actual authentication attempt including a signature by the corresponding private key. As Tectia does not limit the number of public-key authentication requests, there’s no issue with it. The OpenSSH MaxAuthTries setting, however, limits the number of failed authentication requests overall, of any type, and OpenSSH counts a “no” answer to a public-key query as a failure. A common side effect is an unexpected limit to the number of keys you can usefully have in an agent! If you have five keys in your agent, and it happens to be the fifth one that would let you in, you’re out of luck: the server will disconnect you after the client tries the fourth key. And that’s assuming the client didn’t try and fail some other methods first, e.g., GSSAPI or host- based; then even fewer keys could be tried.  See [7.4.2.1] for a workaround.   There are various security arguments to made here, of course. The server can’t distin- guish between a legitimate user trying keys and an attacker knocking on the door, so it measures all attempts against the repeated-authentication limit. In fact, one can argue that the server shouldn’t honor public-key queries because they reveal informa- tion to an attacker: which key to try to steal, or whether an account can be accessed at all. These are all trade-offs of convenience versus security, and different server implementations take different approaches.  You can work around this issue by listing your most relevant keys in your client con- figuration file, ~ .ssh config, with the IdentityFile keyword. [7.4.2] Keys that are in both the agent and the configuration file are tried first by the client. Therefore, you can associate particular keys with a particular host so that they’re tried first for authentication.  Limiting simultaneous connections  5.3.3.7 sshd can handle an arbitrary number of simultaneous connections by default. Both OpenSSH and Tectia provide keywords to limit the maximum number, if you want to conserve resources on your server machine or reduce the risk of denial-of-service attacks. For OpenSSH it is MaxStartups, and for Tectia it is MaxConnections:  To specify an unlimited number of connections, provide a value of zero:   OpenSSH MaxStartups 32   Tectia MaxConnections 32   OpenSSH MaxStartups 0   Tectia MaxConnections 0  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    157   Of course, the number of connections is also limited by available memory or other operating system resources. These keywords have no effect on these other factors.  Sorry, you can’t increase your CPU speed by setting a keyword!   OpenSSH’s MaxStartups keyword has one additional bit of functionality. If you pro- vide a triple of integers separated by colons, of the form A:B:C, this tells the server to refuse connections based on probabilities. Specifically, if the number of connections is A or greater, sshd will begin rejecting connections. When there are A connections, the probability of rejection is B%. When there are C connections, the probability of rejection is 100%  every attempt is rejected . Between A and C connections, the prob- ability increases linearly from B% to 100%. So, for example, if you have:   OpenSSH MaxStartups 10:50:20  then at a load of 10 connections, the probably of rejection is 50%; at 15 connections  halfway between 10 and 20  it’s 75%  halfway between 50% and 100% , and at 20 connections it’s 100%.  Tectia’s behavior is simpler. After the maximum number of connections have been accepted, new connection attempts are rejected, and the server sends a “Too many connections” error message back to the client before it disconnects. Tectia can also limit the number of connections at compile time via the --with-ssh-connection- limit option. [4.3.5.3]  If sshd is launched by xinetd, then you can control server resources much more pre- cisely: the rate of incoming connections, server memory, and more. [5.3.3.2]  Reverse IP mappings  5.3.3.8 The SSH server optionally does a reverse DNS lookup on a client’s IP address. That is, it looks up the name associated with the address, then looks up the addresses for that name and makes sure that the client’s address is among them. If this check fails, the server refuses the connection. This feature uses standard system services like gethostbyname    and gethostbyaddr    to perform these mappings, so the databases that are consulted depend on the host operating system configuration. It might use the DNS, the Network Information Service  NIS or YP , static files on a server machine, or some combination.  To enable this check for OpenSSH, provide the UseDNS keyword with a value of yes or no:*   OpenSSH UseDNS yes  * Tectia has a similar-sounding keyword, RequireReverseMapping, but it applies only to the AllowHosts and  DenyHosts features. [5.5.3]  158    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This feature is a bit of security-oriented consistency checking. SSH uses crypto- graphic signatures to determine a peer’s identity, but the list of peer public keys  the known hosts database  is often indexed by hostname, so SSH must translate the address to a name in order to check the peer’s identity. Reverse mapping tries to ensure that someone isn’t playing games with the naming service in a cracking attempt. There is a trade-off, however, since in today’s Internet, the DNS reverse- address mappings aren’t always kept up to date. The SSH server might reject legiti- mate connection attempts because of poorly maintained reverse-address mappings over which you have no control. In general, we recommend turning off this feature; it isn’t usually worth the hassle, and you avoid long reverse-lookup delays at times when DNS is down.  Controlling the Nagle Algorithm  5.3.3.9 TCP IP has a feature called the Nagle Algorithm, which is designed to reduce the number of TCP segments sent with very small amounts of data  e.g., one byte , usu- ally as part of an interactive terminal session. Over fast links such as Ethernet, the Nagle Algorithm generally isn’t needed. Over a wide-area network, however, it can cause noticeable delays in the responsiveness of X clients and character terminal dis- plays, as multibyte terminal control sequences may be transmitted inconveniently by the algorithm. In such cases, you should turn off the Nagle Algorithm using the NoDelay keyword:   Tectia NoDelay yes  NoDelay disables the Nagle Algorithm by toggling the TCP_NODELAY bit when requesting a TCP connection from the Unix kernel. Legal values are yes  to disable  and no  to enable; the default .  NoDelay can be enabled or disabled by the Tectia client, rather than serverwide, using the client configuration keyword NoDelay. [7.4.5.5] It usually makes more sense to use NoDelay for a single client connection than to control the Nagle Algorithm glo- bally for all connections on the server side.  5.3.3.10 Discovering other servers Tectia can seek out and discover other Tectia servers automatically. The keyword MaxBroadcastsPerSecond, when given an integer value greater than zero, causes a Tec- tia server to respond to UDP broadcasts sent to port 22:   Tectia MaxBroadcastsPerSecond 10  The server responds to only this many queries per second; any excess broadcasts are silently ignored. All UDP broadcasts received on port 22 apply to this limit, includ- ing unrecognized or malformed packets. The rate limiting prevents a denial-of- service attack that floods the server with queries, causing it to spend all its time replying to them.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    159   By default, Tectia servers do not respond to UDP broadcasts. This behavior can be specified explicitly by setting MaxBroadcastsPerSecond to zero:   Tectia MaxBroadcastsPerSecond 0  No mechanism is provided to use a UDP port other than 22, and the UDP port is completely independent of the TCP port s  used for ordinary SSH connections.  A program supplied with Tectia, ssh-probe, sends queries to one or more specified broadcast addresses. It listens for replies, and prints the locations  IP addresses and ports  along with the versions of any Tectia servers that it finds:   Tectia $ ssh-probe 10.1.2.255 10.1.2.3:22:SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2 10.1.2.5:22:SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2 10.1.2.5:2222:SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2 10.1.2.5:3333:SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2 10.1.2.9:22:SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2 ...  Directed broadcasts  i.e., those on different networks  can be used if intervening gateways are willing to forward them. IP addresses of specific hosts  but not host- names  can also be used.  UDP datagrams received on non-broadcast addresses are usually deliv- ered only to a single process, so if several Tectia servers are running on a target host, then only one will respond. Use broadcast addresses to detect multiple servers.  ssh-probe does not use the ProtocolVersionString to determine the version: this string is part of the initial negotiation between SSH servers and clients for TCP con- nections. [5.3.7] Tectia servers always supply their actual version string in response to UDP queries by ssh-probe.  The default output format is intended to be parsed easily by programs. The –r option prints results in a more human-readable format:   Tectia $ ssh-probe -r 10.1.2.255 Server address = "10.1.2.3" Server port = "22" Server version = "SSH Tectia Server 4.1.3.2" ... 12 servers detected.  The –s option causes ssh-probe to operate silently, returning only an exit value of 0 to indicate that at least one server was found, 1 if no replies were received, or -1 if some other error occurred:  160    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    Tectia $ ssh-probe -s 10.1.2.255 $ case $? in >     0  echo "Tectia found.";; >     1  echo "Tectia missing.";; >     *  echo "Something bad happened to ssh-probe!";; > esac Tectia found.  By default, ssh-probe waits one second for replies. The –t option specifies a longer timeout, e.g., for slow or distant servers:   Tectia $ ssh-probe -t 5 10.1.2.255  ssh-probe supports the –d option for debug output. [5.9] The program uses the mod- ule names SshProbe and SshServerProbe.  Port-scanning programs such as nmap provide a more general way to locate SSH servers, including other implementations like OpenSSH, even though port scans typi- cally don’t provide version information as ssh-probe does for Tectia servers. For example, to use nmap to scan a range of network addresses for any kinds of SSH servers listening on  TCP  port 22:  $ nmap -v -p 22 10.1.2.0 24  The ScanSSH program* scans ranges of network addresses, identifying SSH servers  along with open proxies and other interesting servers, such as HTTP and SMTP . It attempts to determine the version for each. For example, to scan the same network address range:  $ scanssh -s ssh 10.1.2.0 24  MaxBroadcastsPerSecond and ssh-probe are a rather ad hoc solution for locating Tec- tia servers, and port scans are questionable, since authorized users typically know the identity of specific servers to which they have been granted access. Probes often don’t work across firewalls, and they might be mistaken for attacks by people and programs that monitor network activity.  Better techniques are available to enumerate servers for administrative tasks, e.g., maintaining a list of servers in a netgroup or other database. Dynamic DNS and SRV records are alternatives, although this nameserver functionality is still not widely used.  Key Regeneration  5.3.4 All SSH servers maintain a persistent host key. It is generated by the system administra- tor when installing SSH and identifies the host for authentication purposes. [5.3.1.1]  * http:  www.monkey.org ~provos scanssh   This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    161   Additionally, SSH-2 clients and servers exchange keys for data encryption and integ- rity. By default, the Tectia client and server perform this key exchange every hour  3600 seconds  but you can set this with the RekeyIntervalSeconds keyword. A value of zero disables rekeying.   Tectia RekeyIntervalSeconds 7200  This keyword only controls the automatic, periodic session rekeying that is initiated by the server. An SSH client can still request session rekeying at any time.  You can make the ssh client force rekeying with the escape sequence ~R  OpenSSH  or ~r  for Tectia . [7.4.6.8]  Encryption Algorithms  5.3.5 The SSH server can use a number of data-encryption algorithms for its secure con- nection; the client chooses a cipher from the list the server allows. The Ciphers key- word describes the subset of allowable ciphers, selected from those the server software supports. Its value is a comma-separated list of algorithm names  strings , case-sensitive,* indicating which algorithms are permissible. For example:  Ciphers 3des-cbc Ciphers 3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,arcfour  The order of the values is not significant, since the client drives the choice of the cipher.  If multiple Ciphers keywords are specified, the values are not accumulated into a sin- gle list. Instead, OpenSSH uses the list for the first Ciphers keyword, and Tectia uses the last.  OpenSSH treats unrecognized cipher names as fatal errors, but Tectia silently ignores them, which makes typos hard to detect. For trouble- shooting, use the sshd -d command-line option [5.9] with the SshConfigParse module and a high debug level:   Tectia sshd -d SshConfigParse=9  Look for “ssh_config_set_param_algs” in the output to see the actual list of cipher names that were used.  The Ciphers keyword is useful for quickly disabling individual encryption algo- rithms—say, if a security hole is discovered in one of them. Just omit that algorithm from the Ciphers list and restart the server.  * Older versions of OpenSSH treat the algorithm names as case-insensitive.  162    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Both OpenSSH and Tectia support the following standard ciphers that are defined by the IETF SECSH draft:  In addition, Tectia implements the following standard ciphers:*  3des-cbc aes128-cbc aes192-cbc aes256-cbc arcfour blowfish-cbc cast128-cbc  none twofish-cbc twofish128-cbc twofish192-cbc twofish256-cbc  acss@openssh.org† aes128-ctr aes192-ctr aes256-ctr rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se  cast128-12-cbc@ssh.com des-cbc@ssh.com rc2-cbc@ssh.com rc2-128-cbc@ssh.com rijndael-cbc@ssh.com  The “none” cipher means that no encryption is used. This is unsuitable for produc- tion use, but it might occasionally be convenient for testing, e.g., if you are watching SSH traffic using a network sniffer for diagnostic purposes. Subconfiguration files can restrict insecure ciphers like “none” to specific hosts or users. [11.6.2]  OpenSSH also implements a number of nonstandard ciphers:  By default, all ciphers supported by the OpenSSH server  both standard and non- standard  are allowed.  Tectia supports a different set of recommended, nonstandard ciphers:  Tectia also recognizes special values for the Cipher keyword indicating sets of algorithms:  * A few standard ciphers aren’t supported by either OpenSSH or Tectia:  idea-cbc, serpent128-cbc,  serpent192-cbc, and serpent256-cbc. These are all considered optional by the IETF SECSH draft.  † Cipher acss@openssh.org is not allowed by default; it must be explicitly enabled.

All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    163   Tectia FIPS Mode  The FIPS 140-2 standard defines strict requirements for performing cryptographic operations, including allowable ciphers. Tectia servers can use a special cryptographic library that is certified to be FIPS 140-2 compliant. In FIPS mode, the server supports only the following ciphers:  3des-cbc aes128-cbc aes192-cbc aes256-cbc des-cbc@ssh.com  To enable FIPS mode, run the ssh-crypto-library-chooser command:  To use the standard cryptographic library that supports all of the ciphers:   Tectia $ ssh-crypto-library-chooser fips   Tectia $ ssh-crypto-library-chooser std  With no command-line argument, the ssh-crypto-library-chooser command just prints the currently used library. The server must be restarted whenever the library is changed.  Any standard algorithm implemented by Tectia, including none  AnyStd  AnyStdCipher  Any  Same as AnyStd, but excluding none  Any standard or recommended, nonstandard algorithm implemented by Tectia, including none  AnyCipher  Same as Any, but excluding none  These special values are case-insensitive, in contrast to the other values for cipher names. We recommend using the capitalization shown earlier, but you may see low- ercase values in older Tectia configuration files or documentation.  An important and unfortunate restriction is that the special values for cipher sets cannot be mixed with other cipher names:   Tectia: This is ILLEGAL Ciphers 3des-cbc,AnyStd  The default for Tectia is AnyStdCipher.  164    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Cipher Naming Conventions  Ciphers use a conventional naming scheme that encodes the algorithm and any vari- able parameters. We illustrate the conventions by dissecting a sample cipher name: cast128-12-cbc@ssh.com. Here is the meaning of each part: cast  The name of the algorithm in lowercase. [3.8]  128  -12  -cbc  Many algorithms can use different key lengths. For these, the number of bits in the key immediately follows the algorithm name. If the algorithm name ends in a digit, then a hyphen is added between the name and the key size  e.g., rc2-128 for the RC2 algorithm using 128-bit keys .  A few algorithms are defined in terms of other parameters. If needed, these are specified next, each with a leading hyphen. For example, the CAST algorithm can use different numbers of rounds of encryption instead of the default 16.  Block cipher algorithms can be run in a variety of modes of operation: ECB  CBC  CFB  OFB  CTR  Electronic code book  Cipher block chaining  Cipher feedback  Output feedback  Counter  3des-ecb@ssh.com 3des-cfb@ssh.com 3des-ofb@ssh.com aes-ecb@ssh.com aes-cbc@ssh.com  The mode is appended to the cipher name, again translated to lowercase, with a hyphen.  @ssh.com:  Finally, the IETF SECSH draft specifies that nonstandard ciphers must have a suf- fix with a leading @ character indicating the domain that defined the cipher.  Tectia’s extensive but poorly documented cryptographic library actually supports a much wider range of ciphers, including:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    165   aes-cfb@ssh.com aes-ofb@ssh.com aes-ctr@ssh.com blowfish-ecb@ssh.com blowfish-cfb@ssh.com blowfish-ofb@ssh.com cast128-ecb@ssh.com cast128-cfb@ssh.com cast128-ofb@ssh.com cast128-12-ecb@ssh.com cast128-12-cfb@ssh.com cast128-12-ofb@ssh.com des-ecb@ssh.com des-cfb@ssh.com des-ofb@ssh.com rc2-ecb@ssh.com rc2-cfb@ssh.com rc2-ofb@ssh.com rc2-128-ecb@ssh.com rc2-128-cfb@ssh.com rc2-128-ofb@ssh.com rijndael-ecb@ssh.com rijndael-cfb@ssh.com rijndael-ofb@ssh.com rijndael-ctr@ssh.com twofish-ecb@ssh.com twofish-cfb@ssh.com twofish-ofb@ssh.com  These are not included in the sets for Any or AnyCipher. In some cases, this is because the ciphers are considered experimental or inferior. For example, DES is usually not recommended because of its short key length, and block ciphers in ECB mode are considered vulnerable to replay attacks. Other modes such as CFB, OFB, and CTR are plausible alternatives to the default CBC, however.  Finally, Tectia recognizes a small number of convenient aliases for sets of ciphers:  Value aes-cbc cast twofish  Meaning aes128-cbc, aes192-cbc aes256-cbc cast128-cbc twofish-cbc, twofish128-cbc, twofish192-cbc, twofish256-cbc  166    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In most cases, the names of block ciphers in CBC mode are also recog- nized by Tectia without “-cbc”, since CBC is considered the default mode. There are exceptions, however, that don’t follow any obvious pattern:    aes-cbc@ssh.com   cast128-cbc   cast128-12-cbc@ssh.com   rc2-cbc@ssh.com   rc2-128-cbc@ssh.com   twofish-cbc  We therefore recommend explicitly specifying -cbc in cipher names. Tectia is rather forgiving  or sloppy, depending on your point of view  about the @ssh.com suffix for cipher names, which is supposed to be used consistently for nonstandard ciphers. Most standard cipher names are also recognized with this suffix. The exceptions are:   aes128-cbc   aes192-cbc   aes256-cbc   twofish128-cbc   twofish192-cbc   twofish256-cbc  Similarly, the suffix can be omitted from most nonstandard cipher names. The lone exception is aes-cbc@ssh.com, because the name without the suffix is used as an alias for all AES ciphers in CBC mode with any key length, as described earlier. Misusing the @ssh.com suffix in this way is inadvisable, because it violates the IETF SECSH draft.  Integrity-Checking  MAC  Algorithms  5.3.6 The MACs keyword selects the allowable integrity-checking algorithms, known as the message authentication code  MAC , used by sshd. [3.4.2.3] Except as described below, the MACs keyword behaves exactly like the Ciphers keyword. [5.3.5] Here are some examples:  MACs hmac-sha1 MACs hmac-sha1,hmac-md5  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    167   Both OpenSSH and Tectia support the following standard MAC algorithms defined by the IETF SECSH draft:  hmac-sha1 hmac-sha1-96 hmac-md5 hmac-md5-96  In addition, Tectia implements the standard “none” MAC, meaning that no integrity checking is performed. This is intended only for testing.  In Tectia’s FIPS mode, only the hmac-sha1 MAC is supported.  implements  OpenSSH also hmac- ripemd160@openssh.com. The name hmac-ripemd160 is also recognized without the @openssh.com suffix, but this is deprecated, since all nonstandard names are supposed to use a domain suffix. Tectia also supports some nonstandard MAC algorithms:  nonstandard MAC algorithm,  a  hmac-ripemd160@ssh.com hmac-ripemd160-96@ssh.com hmac-sha256@ssh.com hmac-sha256-96@ssh.com hmac-tiger128@ssh.com hmac-tiger128-96@ssh.com hmac-tiger160@ssh.com hmac-tiger160-96@ssh.com hmac-tiger192@ssh.com hmac-tiger192-96@ssh.com ssl3-md5@ssh.com ssl3-sha1@ssh.com  Tectia recognizes special values for the Macs keyword to describe sets of algorithms:  AnyStd  AnyStdMac  Any  AnyMac  Any standard algorithm implemented by Tectia, including none  Same as AnyStd, but excluding none  Any standard or nonstandard algorithm implemented by Tectia, including none  Same as Any, but excluding none  168    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Algorithm Naming Conventions  MAC names encode the algorithm and parameters, as for cipher names. To demon- strate, let’s decode a sample name: hmac-ripemd160-96@ssh.com: hmac-  Algorithms are prefixed by the name of the scheme that is used to combine a shared secret key with the contents of each packet. The most common is HMAC, the keyed hashing technique described by RFC-2104. Tectia also supports an early HMAC variant used by SSL Version 3, denoted by the prefix “ssl3-”.  ripemd160  -96  @ssh.com  The name of MAC hash algorithm is next, which often contains digits that indi- cate either a version  e.g., sha1 and md5  or the number of bits produced by the hash. [3.8.3] The names are translated to lowercase, and any hyphens are removed.  Some MAC algorithms have variants that truncate a larger message digest to a smaller number of bits. These are appended to the name, preceded by a hyphen.  A suffix is required by the IETF SECSH draft for nonstandard ciphers, describing the domain that defined the MAC algorithm, preceded by an @ character.  By default, Tectia allows algorithms in the AnyStdMac set.  The Any value includes all supported MAC algorithms, unlike the Ciphers keyword.  OpenSSH allows all its available MACs by default.  Tectia also recognizes standard MAC names with the @ssh.com suf- fix. The suffix cannot be omitted for nonstandard MAC names, how- ever, in contrast to the Ciphers keyword. It’s best to use the suffix consistently according to the IETF SECSH draft, only for nonstandard names.  SSH Protocol Settings  5.3.7 OpenSSH lets you limit its protocol support to SSH-1, SSH-2, or both, using the Protocol keyword. Permissible values are 1  for SSH-1 , 2  for SSH-2 , or both 1 and 2 separated by a comma  the default :   OpenSSH Protocol 2,1  If you specify both protocols, the order doesn’t matter since the client, not the server, drives the authentication process. And as we’ve said before, the SSH-1 protocol is less secure and we recommend avoiding it. [3.5]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.3 Getting Ready: Initial Setup    169   Protocol version string  5.3.7.1 SSH servers and clients exchange protocol version information as part of their initial negotiations, to agree on a protocol. [3.4.4.2] You can see the protocol version string used by the server by connecting to the SSH port:  $ telnet localhost 22 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. SSH-2.0-4.1.3.2 SSH Secure Shell  By default, Tectia servers use a string like “4.1.3.2 SSH Secure Shell” for the com- ment part  after the second hyphen  of the protocol version. This can be changed using the undocumented ProtocolVersionString keyword:   Tectia ProtocolVersionString Generic SSH Implementation  Port-scanning tools that connect to the SSH port and observe the protocol version string will not see the detailed information about the specific installed version of Tec- tia if the string is changed:  $ telnet localhost 22 Trying 127.0.0.1... Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. SSH-2.0-Generic SSH Implementation  ProtocolVersionString changes only the comment part of the version string. The initial parts  e.g., SSH-2.0  always specify the protocol s  that the server is willing to use, according to the SSH protocol standard.  Although an obscured ProtocolVersionString might thwart very simplistic port- scanning tools, in practice it doesn’t help much, since many attacks try to exploit bugs regardless of the version string, and determined attackers can probably figure out the implementation by noticing specific behavioral quirks of the server anyway. If the Tectia server is configured to respond to UDP queries by ssh-probe [5.3.3.10], then it always will respond to such queries with the actual version information, not the changed ProtocolVersionString. Furthermore, changing ProtocolVersionString might prevent workarounds by clients for known server incompatibilities or bugs.  The OpenSSH server always uses a string like “OpenSSH_3.9p1” for its protocol ver- sion string. This cannot be changed except by modifying the source code.  Compression  5.3.8 The data flowing between the SSH client and server may optionally be compressed to save bandwidth. Often this option is set by the client [7.4.14], but OpenSSH gives  170    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   the server the ultimate authority on whether data compression is permitted, using the Compression keyword:   OpenSSH Compression no  The default value is yes.  Authentication: Verifying Identities  5.4 A large part of the SSH server’s job is to grant or deny connection requests from cli- ents. This is done at two levels: authentication and access control  a.k.a. authoriza- tion . We discuss the former here and the latter in the section “Access Control: Letting People In.” [5.5] Authentication, as we’ve seen, means verifying the identity of the user requesting a connection.  Authentication Syntax  5.4.1 sshd supports several different techniques for authentication that may be enabled or disabled. [3.1.3] [3.4.3] For example, if you don’t trust password authentication, you can turn it off serverwide but still permit public-key authentication.  As SSH has evolved, the syntax for configuring authentication has changed several times, and OpenSSH and Tectia use entirely different syntaxes. In OpenSSH, differ- ent authentication techniques are turned on and off with keywords of the form:   Authentication example,  password  For keyword PasswordAuthentication, public-key authentication by PubKeyAuthentication, and so forth, one keyword per technique. Values may be yes or no, as in:  authentication  controlled  the  by  is   OpenSSH PubKeyAuthentication yes  Table 5-1 lists all the authentication techniques supported by OpenSSH, and each is described in detail later.  Table 5-1. OpenSSH authentication keywords  Keyword  ChallengeResponseAuthentication  GSSAPIAuthentication  HostbasedAuthentication  PasswordAuthentication  PubKeyAuthentication  Meaning One-time passwords. Typically used for Kerberos. Host-based authentication. Password authentication. Exactly what this means is determined by the UsePAM and KerberosAuthentication keywords. Public-key authentication.  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    171  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Table 5-1. OpenSSH authentication keywords  continued   Keyword  RhostsRSAAuthentication  RSAAuthentication  Meaning SSH-1 protocol only: avoid. SSH-1 protocol only: avoid.  Tectia has a more extensible syntax. Instead of creating a new keyword for each tech- nique, and RequiredAuthentications. Each is followed by the names of one or more authentica- tion techniques, separated by commas. For example:  AllowedAuthentications  keywords,  only  two  you  use   Tectia AllowedAuthentications password,hostbased,publickey  AllowedAuthentications means that any of the given techniques can be used. In con- trast, RequiredAuthentications means that all of the listed techniques must be used. If both keywords are present, then RequiredAuthentications is used, and AllowedAuthentications is ignored.* Table 5-2 lists the supported values for these keywords. The first four techniques are specified by the IETF SECSH draft, while the ones with the @ssh.com suffix are nonstandard. It doesn’t matter in what order you list the values because the SSH client, not the server, drives the authentication pro- cess. By default, Tectia’s sshd allows only password and public-key authentication.  Table 5-2. Tectia authentication techniques for AllowedAuthentications and RequiredAuthentications  Value  password  publickey  hostbased  keyboard-interactive  gssapi-with-mic  gssapi  kerberos-2@ssh.com  kerberos-tgt-2@ssh.com  pam-1@ssh.com  securid-1@ssh.com  Meaning Password authentication.

GSSAPI authentication  deprecated in favor of gssapi-with-mic . Kerberos. Unsupported. Not available by default: requires recompilation. Kerberos authentication with TGT  passed to server . Unsupported. Not available by default: requires recompilation. Mostly obsolete: replaced by keyboard-interactive. Used only for old clients. Mostly obsolete: replaced by keyboard-interactive. Used only for old clients.  * This behavior, with RequiredAuthentications overriding AllowedAuthentications, began in Version 3.1.0 of Tectia’s sshd. In previous versions, the two keywords were used together, but in practice this forced the two lists of techniques to be identical: a required technique must also be allowed, and an allowed technique that is not required is pointless, since it would be insufficient for authentication.  172    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   We now describe how to enable and disable each type of authentication except the deprecated SSH-1 keywords, which are in Appendix D.  Password Authentication  5.4.2 Password authentication accepts your login password as proof of identity. [3.4.3.5] OpenSSH allows the PasswordAuthentication keyword, given the value yes  the default  or no:  authentication  password  disallows  with  or   OpenSSH PasswordAuthentication yes  Normally, OpenSSH password authentication requires your ordinary login pass- word. However, this may be changed via PAM [5.4.8], Kerberos [5.4.7], or other fea- tures. For Tectia, you can allow or require password authentication by adding the value password to the lists for AllowedAuthentications or RequiredAuthentications, respectively:   Tectia AllowedAuthentications password  Failed password attempts  5.4.2.1 Tectia servers wait two seconds by default after each failed password authentication attempt, to thwart brute-force password-guessing attacks. The AuthInteractive- FailureTimeout keyword controls this delay:   Tectia AuthInteractiveFailureTimeout 5  Empty passwords  5.4.2.2 If an account has an empty password, both the OpenSSH and Tectia servers may refuse access feature is controlled by the keyword PermitEmptyPasswords with a value of yes  the default  or no. If enabled:  to the account. This  PermitEmptyPasswords yes  empty passwords are permissible; otherwise, they are not.  Expired passwords  5.4.2.3 Some operating systems support expiration dates for passwords. For those that do, OpenSSH and Tectia allow expired passwords to be changed during authentication.  If the OpenSSH server detects an expired password, it runs the system passwd com- mand to change it once the user has logged in. It then closes the connection so that the user must log in again:  $ ssh -oPubKeyAuthentication=no -l smith server.example.com smith@server.example.com's password:  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    173  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Last login: Sat Jan 22 17:07:27 2005 from client.example.com WARNING: Your password has expired. You must change your password now and login again! Changing local password for smith. Old password: New password: Retype new password: Connection to server.example.com closed.  For Tectia, by default, after the server verifies the user’s password, if the password is found to be expired, then the system’s password-change program  e.g., passwd  is run as a forced command. [8.2.3] An alternate password-change program  e.g., one that enforces policies for choosing good passwords  can be specified by the PasswdPath keyword:   Tectia PasswdPath  usr local bin goodpasswd  The password-change program runs with the privileges of the user, not those of the server  typically root . Here’s an example of a password change during authentica- tion, from the client’s perspective:  $ ssh server.example.com rebecca's password:   Authentication successful.   Changing password for user rebecca. Changing password for rebecca  current  UNIX password:   New password:   Retype new password:   passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. Connection to server.example.com closed.  We discuss more powerful alternatives to this technique in a later case study. [11.7.1]  Public-Key Authentication  5.4.3 Public-key authentication verifies a user’s identity by cryptographic key. [2.4] In OpenSSH, public-key forbidden with the PubKeyAuthentication keyword which may have the value yes  the default  or no:*  authentication is permitted or    OpenSSH PubKeyAuthentication yes  For Tectia, you allow or require public-key authentication by adding the value publickey to the lists for AllowedAuthentications or RequiredAuthentications, respectively:   Tectia AllowedAuthentications publickey  * For SSH-1 protocol connections in OpenSSH, use the keyword RSAAuthentication instead.  174    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia provides keywords that restrict the minimum and maximum sizes for public keys:   Tectia AuthPublicKey.MinSize 1024 AuthPublicKey.MaxSize 2048  You might want to require a minimum key size for improved security, but reject huge keys because they slow down authentication. A value of zero  the default  dis- ables the key-size checks.  Public-key authentication is marvelously configurable for most SSH implementa- tions. See Chapter 8 for details on tailoring authentication for individual accounts.  Hostbased Authentication  5.4.4 Hostbased authentication verifies an SSH client’s identity by checking the remote hostname and username associated with it. [3.4.3.6] This mimics the behavior of the insecure Berkeley r-commands  rsh, rlogin, rcp  which check the server files  etc  hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts for permission to authenticate. SSH’s hostbased authentica- tion is more secure, however: instead of relying on a potentially compromised net- work naming service  e.g., DNS, NIS  and a privileged TCP source port, the SSH server uses secure, cryptographic tests of host keys to verify the client host’s identity.  OpenSSH has the keyword HostbasedAuthentication  surprise!  to enable or disable this type of authentication:*    OpenSSH HostbasedAuthentication yes  For Tectia, you allow or require hostbased authentication by adding the value hostbased to the lists for AllowedAuthentications or RequiredAuthentications, respectively:   Tectia AllowedAuthentications hostbased  Hostbased authentication is useful but unfortunately also enables connections via the insecure r-commands, since it obeys the same permission files. To eliminate this potential security risk, use the SSH-specific files  etc shosts.equiv and ~ .shosts instead of  etc hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts. In fact, we recommend you delete  etc hosts.equiv and forbid your users to create ~ .rhosts files.  An even better approach is to disable the services for insecure protocols like the r-commands; these services are usually started by inetd or xinetd.   You can also tell the SSH server to ignore all users’ .rhosts and .shosts files with the key- word IgnoreRhosts.  This keyword does not impact the system files  etc shosts.equiv  * OpenSSH has another keyword, RhostsRSAAuthentication, that applies only to SSH-1 protocol connections.  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    175  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   and  etc hosts.equiv, however.  Permissible values are yes  to ignore them  or no  the default :  IgnoreRhosts yes  Ignoring users’ files might be appropriate in an environment of centralized control, where only sysadmins are authorized to decide which hosts are trusted for authentication.  Tectia permits separate control over hostbased authentication for root. The keyword IgnoreRootRhosts permits or prevents use of the superuser’s .rhosts and .shosts files, overriding IgnoreRhosts:  Values of yes  ignore the files  and no  don’t ignore  are permitted. If not specified, the value of IgnoreRootRhosts defaults to that of IgnoreRhosts. For example, you can permit all .rhosts and .shosts files except root’s:   Tectia IgnoreRootRhosts yes   Tectia IgnoreRhosts no IgnoreRootRhosts yes   Tectia IgnoreRhosts yes IgnoreRootRhosts no  or ignore all .rhosts files except root’s:  Again, IgnoreRootRhosts doesn’t stop the server from considering  etc hosts.equiv and  etc shosts.equiv. For stronger security, it’s best to disable hostbased access entirely.  The SSH server needs the public keys of all hosts from which it accepts connections via hostbased authentication. These keys are kept in a single file,  etc ssh ssh_known_ hosts  for OpenSSH , or in separate files in the directory  etc ssh2 knownhosts  for Tectia . A host’s public key is fetched from these locations whenever that host requests a connection. Optionally, the server also searches the file ~ .ssh known_ hosts  for OpenSSH  or separate files in the directory ~ .ssh2 knownhosts in the tar- get user’s account.  This optional feature  which is enabled by default  can be controlled with the key- words IgnoreUserKnownHosts  for OpenSSH :   OpenSSH IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes  or UserKnownHosts  for Tectia :   Tectia UserKnownHosts no  Having sshd consult the user’s known hosts database might be unacceptable in a security-conscious environment. Since hostbased authentication relies on the integ- rity and correct administration of the client host, the system administrator usually  176    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   grants hostbased authentication privileges to only a limited set of audited hosts. If the user’s file is respected, however, a user can extend this trust to a possibly inse- cure remote host. An attacker can then:    Compromise the insecure, remote host   Impersonate the user on the remote host   Access the user’s local account via SSH, without needing a key passphrase or the  local account password  Hostbased authentication can be complicated by other aspects of your server machine’s environment, such as DNS, NIS, and the ordering of entries in static host files. It may also open new avenues for attack on a system. [3.4.3.6]  Tectia servers can require that the hostname provided by the client must match the one found in DNS, using the keyword HostbasedAuthForceClientHostnameDNSMatch:   Tectia HostbasedAuthForceClientHostnameDNSMatch yes  By default, no such check is performed, and in practice, this feature provides only a moderate level of protection against spoofing, since the DNS server s  can still be attacked. [3.6.2]  Keyboard-Interactive Authentication  5.4.5 Keyboard-interactive authentication is an extensible, general-purpose mechanism for implementing a variety of authentication techniques that require interaction with the remote user, such as one-time passwords and challenge-response schemes. Clients must implement the keyboard-interactive protocol  described in an IETF SECSH draft, and tunneled securely over the SSH transport layer  but need no other modifi- cations as new authentication techniques are added. An example of a keyboard-interactive authentication technique is one-time pass- words, found in systems like Bellcore’s S Key. “One-time” means that each time you authenticate, you provide a different password, helping to guard against attacks, since a captured password will likely be useless. Here’s how it works:  1. When you connect to a remote service, it provides you with an integer and a  string, called the sequence number and the key, respectively.  2. You enter the sequence number and key into an S Key calculator program on  your local machine.  3. You also enter a secret passphrase into the calculator, known only to yourself. This passphrase isn’t transmitted over the network, only into the calculator on your local machine, so security is maintained.  4. Based on the three inputs you provided, the calculator produces your one-time  password.  5. You enter the password to authenticate to the remote service.  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    177  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Method BSD authentication PAM S Key   OpenSSH UsePAM yes  More information on one-time passwords is available at:  http:  www.ietf.org html.charters otp-charter.html  5.4.5.1 OpenSSH keyboard-interactive authentication In OpenSSH, you enable keyboard-interactive authentication with the keyword ChallengeResponseAuthentication:   sshd_config ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes  OpenSSH supports three challenge response methods, called “devices,” listed in Table 5-3. Since these methods are dependent on external software, you have to con- figure OpenSSH at compile time to support them.  Table 5-3. OpenSSH keyboard-interactive  challenge response  authentication methods  Device name  bsdauth  pam  skey  Compilation option --with-bsd-auth  --with-pam  --with-skey  PAM is widely available and hence often included in compiled OpenSSH packages. Just make sure the server configuration keyword UsePAM is set: [5.4.8]  BSD authentication will likely be available only if running on a BSD platform  e.g., OpenBSD ; see the manpage for login.conf for details on its operation. If you want S Key support, you have two options: obtain a PAM library that supports it, such as libpam_opie or libpam_skey, or build OpenSSH yourself to get direct S Key sup- port. We recommend the PAM library approach.  In conducting keyboard-interactive authentication, the client by default specifies no device, which means the server will try all. There’s an undocumented client-side option, KbdInteractiveDevices, however, whose value is the list of devices to try:   OpenSSH KbdInteractiveDevices pam,skey,bsdauth  Tectia’s keyboard-interactive authentication  5.4.5.2 For Tectia, you can allow or require keyboard-interactive authentication by adding the value keyboard-interactive to the lists for AllowedAuthentications or RequiredAuthentications, respectively:   Tectia AllowedAuthentications keyboard-interactive  178    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia servers support the following keyboard-interactive authentication techniques:  password  pam  securid  plugin  Standard password authentication [5.4.2]  Pluggable Authentication Modules [5.4.8]  SecurID hardware-based authentication  Programmatic authentication [11.7.2]  Keyboard-interactive authentication techniques can be either optional or required  or both , and are specified using the keywords AuthKbdInt.Optional or AuthKbdInt. Required. Multiple authentication techniques are separated by commas:   Tectia AuthKbdInt.Optional pam,securid,password AuthKbdInt.Required plugin,password  The order of the authentication techniques is not significant for either keyword, since the client drives the authentication process.  Beware of typographic errors in the values of AuthKbdInt.Optional and AuthKbdInt.Required: they are not checked when the server reads them from configuration files. Invalid or unrecognized techniques are detected only when keyboard-interactive authentication is attempted, which can be long after the server starts.  Authentication succeeds if all of the required authentication techniques succeed, as well as a number of optional authentication techniques specified by the AuthKbdInt. NumOptional keyword:   Tectia AuthKbdInt.NumOptional 2  The default for AuthKbdInt.NumOptional is zero if there are any required authentica- tion techniques, or one otherwise.  The AuthKbdInt.Retries keyword determines how many attempts are allowed for keyboard-interactive authentication:   Tectia AuthKbdInt.Retries 5  By default, three retries are allowed.  The Tectia server waits after each failed keyword-interactive authentication attempt, as for password authentication; the AuthInteractiveFailureTimeout keyword applies to this delay. [5.4.2.1]  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    179  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The keyboard-interactive password authentication technique is functionally identi- cal to standard password authentication. [5.4.2]  PAM authentication is supported by binary distributions of Tectia on systems that provide PAM  e.g., Linux, Solaris . On other systems, support for PAM requires recompiling the SSH server with the appropriate PAM headers and libraries. [5.4.8]  SecurID from Security Dynamics is a hardware-based authentication technique. Users need a physical card, called a SecurID card, in order to authenticate. The card contains a microchip that displays  on a little LCD  an integer that changes at regu- lar intervals. To authenticate, provide this integer along with your password. Some versions of the SecurID card also have a keypad that supports entering a password, for two-factor authentication. Users must provide the current integer from their card in order to authenticate.  By default, Tectia allows three attempts to enter the SecurID password. This can be changed with the SecurIdGuesses keyword:   Tectia SecurIdGuesses 5  SecurID support is included in binary distributions of Tectia. The securid keyboard- interactive authentication technique mentioned previously refers to code incorpo- rated into the server. Alternately, separate plugins called ssh-securidv5-plugin and ssh-securidv4-plugin are provided for different RSA ACE versions on some platforms.* In either case, recompiling the server or plugins requires special SecurID headers and libraries. SecurID must also be configured by setting the environment variable VAR_ ACE to the pathname of the ACE data directory before the server is started: consult the SecurID documentation for details.  New authentication techniques can be added using keyboard-interactive plugins. If plugin is specified as either an optional or required keyboard-interactive authentica- tion technique, then the AuthKbdInt.Plugin keyword must be used to identify a pro- gram that controls the interactive authentication steps:†   Tectia AuthKbdInt.Plugin  usr local sbin ssh-keyboard-interactive-plugin  The server communicates with the plugin program using the Tectia plugin protocol, which we’ll describe in a later case study. [11.7.2]  * If SecurID plugins are used, specify plugin instead of securid as the value of AuthKbdInt.Optional or  AuthKbdInt.Required, and set AuthKbdInt.Plugin to the pathname for the appropriate plugin.  † If no plugin program is specified, or the specified program cannot be run, then keyboard-interactive plugin  authentication will always fail.  180    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   PGP Authentication  5.4.6 Tectia can authenticate users via the PGP key. We cover this topic in Chapter 6. [6.5]  Kerberos Authentication  5.4.7 Kerberos, the well-known secure authentication system, can be used by OpenSSH and Tectia. We summarize the Kerberos-related configuration keywords here and defer a more detailed treatment of the topic. [11.4]  Kerberos and OpenSSH  5.4.7.1 Kerberos authentication is supported only if enabled at compile time by the configu- ration option --with-kerberos5. Assuming the SSH server was built in this manner, Kerberos authentication can be used in two ways: directly, and as a verifier for pass- word authentication.  Direct Kerberos authentication is enabled by the GSSAPIAuthentication keyword:   OpenSSH GSSAPIAuthentication yes  This allows normal, ticket-based Kerberos user authentication: it requires that the usual service principal host server@REALM be added to the Kerberos KDC, and that principal’s key added to the server host keytab, usually  etc krb5.keytab. By default, the Kerberos principal foo@REALM will be allowed access to server account “foo”; you can allow others by adding them to ~foo .k5login  along with foo@REALM itself, which would otherwise lose access! . There is also the default:   OpenSSH GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes  which means sshd will delete a user’s forwarded Kerberos credentials on logout; this is usually a good idea and should be left on. [11.5.2]  The second method, password verification, is indirect. It does not require any Ker- beros support on the client at all: it simply means that for regular SSH password authentication, sshd will verify a user’s password against Kerberos. This mode is enabled or disabled by the keyword KerberosAuthentication with the value yes or no:   OpenSSH KerberosAuthentication yes  Instead of checking against the local login password, sshd requests a Kerberos ticket- granting ticket  TGT  for the user and allows login if the ticket matches the pass- word.* It also stores that TGT in the user’s credentials cache, eliminating the need to do a separate kinit. Note that for technical reasons, the server also requires a service  * It also requires a successful granting of a host ticket for the local host as an antispoofing measure.  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    181  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   principal in this case, even though it might not seem necessary: there’s an extra step involved that protects against a KDC spoofing attack.  If Kerberos fails to validate a password, the server optionally validates the same pass- word by ordinary password authentication. This is convenient in an environment where not everyone uses Kerberos. To enable this option, use the keyword KerberosOrLocalPasswd with a value of yes; the default is no:  Finally, since password authentication via Kerberos may also result in stored Ker- beros user credentials, there’s a KerberosTicketCleanup keyword:   OpenSSH KerberosOrLocalPasswd yes   OpenSSH KerberosTicketCleanup yes  Similar to GSSAPICleanupCredentials, this has the server delete such credentials upon logout.  OpenSSH also used to support Kerberos TGT passing via the KerberosTgtPassing keyword, but at press time the support has been removed.  Kerberos and Tectia  5.4.7.2 Kerberos is used with Tectia via GSSAPI authentication. You can allow or require GSSAPI for AllowedAuthentications or RequiredAuthentications, respectively:  authentication by  adding  gssapi  value  lists  the  the  to   Tectia AllowedAuthentications gssapi  GSSAPI authentication was added in Tectia Version 4.2. The older kerberos-2@ssh.com and kerberos-tgt-2@ssh.com authentication methods are still available if they were enabled when Tectia was con- figured, but they are unsupported.  The GSSAPI.AllowedMethods keyword specifies a list of allowed GSSAPI methods. Currently, only kerberos is supported:   Tectia GSSAPI.AllowedMethods kerberos  The kerberos GSSAPI method is allowed by default, so there is currently no reason to use the GSSAPI.AllowedMethods keyword, unless you want to be explicit.  Tectia’s GSSAPI authentication attempts to use the MIC. If the keyword GSSAPI. AllowOldMethodWhichIsInsecure is enabled, then Tectia is willing to fall back to using GSSAPI without MIC:   Tectia GSSAPI.AllowOldMethodWhichIsInsecure yes  182    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The default is yes, since GSSAPI with MIC is not yet widely supported. If the value no is used, then GSSAPI authentication requires MIC: another way to specify this is to use gssapi-with-mic instead of gssapi as the authentication method.  The GSSAPI.Dlls keyword identifies the location of the GSSAPI libraries, as a comma- separated list of full pathnames:   Tectia GSSAPI.Dlls  usr local gssapi lib libgssapi.so  By default, Tectia searches a list of common locations for the libraries, including:     usr lib libgssapi_krb5.so    usr lib libkrb5.so    usr lib libgss.so    usr local gss gl mech_krb5.so    usr local lib libgssapi_krb5.so    usr local lib libkrb5.so    usr kerberos lib libgssapi_krb5.so    usr kerberos lib libkrb5.so    usr lib gss libgssapi_krb5.so  The .so suffix varies for different Unix platforms.  PAM Authentication  5.4.8 The Pluggable Authentication Modules system  PAM  by Sun Microsystems is an infrastructure for supporting multiple authentication methods; it’s found on Solaris and most Linux systems. Ordinarily when a new authentication mechanism comes along, programs need to be rewritten to accommodate it. PAM eliminates this has- sle. Programs are written to support PAM, and new authentication mechanisms may be plugged in at runtime without further source-code modification. More PAM infor- mation is found at:  http:  www.sun.com software solaris pam   OpenSSH includes support for PAM, enabled with the UsePAM keyword, which defaults to no:   OpenSSH UsePAM yes  Tectia supports PAM as a keyboard-interactive authentication technique. [5.4.5]  5.4 Authentication: Verifying Identities    183  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Privilege Separation  5.4.9 OpenSSH supports privilege separation, a security feature that isolates the code that requires root privileges. [3.6.5] You can enable and disable it with the keyword UsePrivilegeSeparation with the value yes  the default  or no.   OpenSSH UsePrivilegeSeparation yes  Selecting a Login Program  5.4.10 Most Unix systems have a program called login for setting up a new user login pro- cess. It can be called by the getty process, for instance, when processing logins on a terminal line, or by a Telnet server. By default, OpenSSH does not use the system’s login program. You can make it do so with the UseLogin keyword:   OpenSSH UseLogin yes  You might need to do this if your system has a login program that performs some specialized processing missing from OpenSSH. However, there are drawbacks to UseLogin yes:    X forwarding is turned off, since sshd loses the chance to specially handle its  xauth cookies for X authentication.    Privilege separation is turned off after user authentication, in order to allow login  to function correctly.  The behavior of a login program versus a login shell is entirely implementation- and operating-system-specific, so we won’t cover the intricacies. If you need to muck about with UseLogin, you first need to understand the features of your operating sys- tem and your login program in detail.  Access Control: Letting People In  5.5 Serverwide access control permits or denies connections from particular hosts or Internet domains, or to specific user accounts on the server machine. It’s applied sep- arately from authentication: for example, even if a user’s identity is legitimate, you might still want to reject connections from her computer. Similarly, if a particular computer or Internet domain has poor security policies, you might want to reject all SSH connection attempts from that domain.  SSH access control is scantily documented and has many subtleties and “gotchas.” The configuration keywords look obvious in meaning, but they aren’t. Our primary goal in this section is to illuminate the murky corners so that you can develop a cor- rect and effective access-control configuration.  184    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Keep in mind that SSH access to an account is permitted only if both the server and the account are configured to allow it. If a server accepts SSH connections to all accounts it serves, individual users may still deny connections to their accounts. [8.2] Likewise, if an account is configured to permit SSH access, the SSH server on its host can nonetheless forbid access. This two-level system applies to all SSH access con- trol, so we won’t state it repeatedly. Figure 5-2 summarizes the two-level access con- trol system.*  connection request  SSH Client  serverwide access control  per-account access control  Access granted  SSH Server  Figure 5-2. Access control levels  Account Access Control  5.5.1 Ordinarily, any account may receive SSH connections as long as it is set up cor- rectly. This access may be overridden by the server keywords AllowUsers and DenyUsers. AllowUsers specifies that only a limited set of local accounts may receive SSH connections. For example, the line:  permits the local smith account, and only the smith account, to receive SSH connec- tions. The configuration file may have multiple AllowUsers lines:  AllowUsers smith  AllowUsers smith AllowUsers jones AllowUsers oreilly  in which case the results are cumulative: the local accounts smith, jones, and oreilly, and only those accounts, may receive SSH connections. The SSH server maintains a list of all AllowUsers values, and when a connection request arrives, it does a string comparison  really a pattern match, as we’ll see in a moment  against the list. If a match occurs, the connection is permitted; otherwise, it’s rejected.  A single AllowUsers keyword in the configuration file cuts off SSH access for all other accounts not mentioned. If the configuration file has no AllowUsers keywords, the server’s AllowUsers list is empty, and connections are permissible to all accounts.  * This concept is true for the configuration keywords discussed in this section but not for hostbased control  files, e.g., ~ .rhosts and  etc hosts.equiv. Each of these may in fact override the other. [3.4.3.6]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.5 Access Control: Letting People In    185   DenyUsers is the opposite of AllowUsers: accounts. For example:  it shuts off SSH access to particular  DenyUsers smith  states that the smith account may not receive SSH connections. DenyUsers keywords may appear multiple times, just like AllowUsers, and the effects are again cumula- tive. As for AllowUsers, the server maintains a list of all DenyUsers values and com- pares incoming connection requests against them.  Tectia recognizes numerical user IDs in place of account names  but OpenSSH does not :   Tectia AllowUsers 123 DenyUsers 456  Both AllowUsers and DenyUsers accept more complicated values than simple account names. An interesting but potentially confusing syntax is to specify both an account name and a hostname  or numeric IP address , separated by an @ symbol:  AllowUsers jones@example.com  Despite its appearance, this string isn’t an email address, and it doesn’t mean “the user jones on the machine example.com.” Rather, it describes a relationship between a local account, jones, and a remote client machine, example.com. The meaning is: “clients on example.com may connect to the server’s jones account.” Although this meaning is surprising, it would be even stranger if jones were a remote account, since the SSH server has no way to verify account names on remote client machines  except when using hostbased authentication .  For OpenSSH, wildcard characters are acceptable in AllowUsers and DenyUsers argu- ments. The ? symbol represents any single character except @, and the * represents any sequence of characters, again not including @. For Tectia, the patterns use the regular-expression syntax that is specified by the REGEX-SYNTAX metaconfiguration parameter; see Appendix B.*  The default egrep regex syntax used by Tectia treats “.” as a wildcard that matches any character, so a hostname pattern like example.com will also match unqualified hostnames like examplexcom. If you are using the egrep regex syntax, be sure to escape literal “.” characters in hostnames, IP addresses, etc., with a backslash character:   Tectia  egrep regex syntax  AllowUsers jones@example\.com  Alternatively, use the zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax, which treats “.” characters literally. See Appendix B for more detailed infor- mation about the different regex syntaxes supported by Tectia.  * Our general discussion of metaconfiguration might also be of help. [11.6.1]  186    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Here are some examples. SSH connections are permitted only to accounts with five- character names ending in “mith”:   OpenSSH, and Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers ?mith   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .mith  SSH connections are permitted only to accounts with names beginning with the let- ter “s”, coming from hosts whose names end in “.edu”:   OpenSSH, and Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers s*@*.edu   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers s.*@.*\.edu  Tectia connections are permitted only to account names of the form “testN” where N is a number, e.g., “test123”.  Tectia connections are permitted only to accounts with numerical user IDs in the range 3000–6999:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers test[[:digit:]]   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers test[[:digit:]]+   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers [3-6][[:digit:]][[:digit:]][[:digit:]]   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers [3-6][[:digit:]]{3}  IP addresses can be used instead of hostnames. For example, to allow access to any user from the network 10.1.1.0 24:*   OpenSSH, and Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers *@10.1.1.*  Tectia  with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .*@10\.1\.1\..*  Tectia also recognizes netmasks preceded by the \m prefix:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers *@\m10.1.1.0 28   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .*@\m10.1.1.0 28  * In this notation, the mask specifies the number of 1 bits in the most-significant portion of the netmask. You might be more familiar with the older, equivalent notation giving the entire netmask, e.g., 10.1.1.0 255.255. 255.0.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Netmasks are always interpreted IP address ranges, without hostname lookups, so \mexample.com 28 does not work.  Netmasks are often more concise than other patterns for expressing IP address ranges, especially those that don’t coincide with an octet boundary. For example, 10.1.1.0 28 is equivalent to the range of addresses 10.1.1.0 through 10.1.1.15, which is expressed as:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers *@10.1.1. [[:digit:]]1[0-5]    Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .*@10\.1\.1\. [[:digit:]]1[0-5]   The specification of address ranges is even more of a struggle using OpenSSH’s lim- ited wildcards, and it is frequently necessary to enumerate individual addresses:   OpenSSH AllowUsers *@10.1.1.? AllowUsers *@10.1.1.10 *@10.1.1.11 *@10.1.1.12 *@10.1.1.13 *@10.1.1.14 *@10.1.1.15  By default, a reverse lookup is first attempted to convert the client’s IP address to a canonical hostname, and if the lookup succeeds, then the hostname is used for pat- tern matches. Next, the IP address is checked using the same patterns.  Access control using IP addresses can avoid some attacks on hostname lookup mecha- nisms, such as compromised nameservers, but we need to be careful. For example, our previous example that intended to limit access to the network 10.1.1.0 24 would actu- ally also allow connections from a machine on some remote network named 10.1.1. evil.org!  Tectia provides several ways to fix this. We can use a more precise pattern that matches only digits, to reject arbitrary domains like evil.org.   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers *@10.1.1.[[:digit:]]   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .*@10\.1\.1\.[[:digit:]]+  An even better approach is to add the \i prefix to force the pattern to be interpreted only as an IP address. This avoids the hostname lookup entirely, and allows us to use simpler patterns safely:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers *@\i10.1.1.*   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers .*@\i10\.1\.1\..*  188    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Even this isn’t foolproof: source IP addresses can be easily spoofed. Address-based access controls are most appropriate for trusted internal networks protected by an external firewall.  Tectia allows some control of the hostname lookups performed for all of the access control patterns. To disable hostname lookups completely, use the Resolve- ClientHostName keyword:   Tectia ResolveClientHostName no  This is appropriate if only IP address matching is desired. It can also be useful if host- name lookups would cause unnecessary delays, e.g., if some nameservers aren’t available.  Conversely, to insist that hostname lookups must succeed, rejecting connections instead of resorting to IP address matching whenever the hostname lookups fail, use the RequireReverseMapping keyword:   Tectia RequireReverseMapping yes  This is appropriate if only hostname address matching is desired. It also provides some limited protection against connections from unrecognized machines.  Of course, hostname lookups should not be disabled by ResolveClientHostName if they are forced by RequireReverseMapping.  Keep in mind that hostname-based access controls are even more inherently weak restrictions than address-based controls, and both should be used only as an adjunct to other strong authentication methods.  Multiple strings may appear on a single AllowUsers line, but the syntax differs for OpenSSH and Tectia. OpenSSH separates strings with whitespace:   OpenSSH AllowUsers smith jones  and Tectia separates them with commas:   Tectia AllowUsers smith,jones AllowUsers rebecca, katie, sarah  Whitespace after commas is undocumented but works  Commas must be escaped with backslashes within regular expres- sions, to prevent misinterpretation as list separators. For example, to allow access by usernames that begin with “elf” and are followed by one to three digits, plus elvis:   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers elf[[:digit:]]{1\,3},elvis  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.5 Access Control: Letting People In    189   AllowUsers and DenyUsers may be combined effectively. Suppose you’re teaching a course and want your students to be the only users with SSH access to your server. It happens that only student usernames begin with “stu”, so you specify:   OpenSSH, and Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers stu*   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers stu.*  Later, one of your students, stu563, drops the course, so you want to disable her SSH access. Simply add the following to the configuration:  DenyUsers stu563  Hmm…this seems strange. The AllowUsers and DenyUsers lines appear to conflict because the first permits stu563 but the second rejects it. The server handles this in the following way: if any line prevents access to an account, the account can’t be accessed. So, in the preceding example, stu563 is denied access by the second line.  Consider another example with this AllowUsers line:   OpenSSH, Tectia AllowUsers smith  followed by a DenyUsers line  appropriate to your SSH implementation :   OpenSSH, Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax DenyUsers s*   Tectia with egrep regex syntax DenyUsers s.*  The pair of lines permits SSH connections to the smith account but denies connec- tions to any account beginning with “s”. What does the server do with this clear con- tradiction? It rejects connections to the smith account, following the same rule: if any restriction prevents access, such as the DenyUsers line shown, access is denied. Access is granted only if there are no restrictions against it.  Finally, here is a useful configuration example:   OpenSSH AllowUsers walrus@* carpenter@* *@*.beach.net   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowUsers walrus@*,carpenter@*,*@*.beach.net   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowUsers walrus@.*,carpenter@.*,.*@.*\.beach\.net  This restricts access for most accounts to connections originating inside the domain beach.net—except for the accounts walrus and carpenter, which may be accessed from anywhere. The hostname qualifiers following walrus and carpenter aren’t strictly necessary but help make clear the intent of the line.  190    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Restricting all logins  5.5.1.1 AllowUsers and DenyUsers operate on individual accounts, but you can also deny access to all users in a pinch. If the file  etc nologin exists, sshd allows only root to log in; no other accounts are allowed access. Thus, touch  etc nologin is a quick way to restrict access to the system administrator only, without having to reconfigure or shut down SSH.  Tectia also checks  etc nologin_ , where   should match the out- put from the hostname command. This is useful if the  etc directory is shared among several machines in a cluster.  Group Access Control  5.5.2 sshd may permit or deny SSH access to all accounts in a Unix group on the server machine. The keywords AllowGroups and DenyGroups serve this purpose:  AllowGroups faculty DenyGroups students  These keywords operate much like AllowUsers and DenyUsers. OpenSSH accepts the wildcards * and ? within group names, and separates multiple groups with whitespace. Tectia accepts patterns according to the regular-expression syntax deter- mined by the metaconfiguration information [11.6.1], and separates groups with commas:   OpenSSH AllowGroups good* better DenyGroups bad* worse   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowGroups good*,better DenyGroups bad*, worse   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowGroups good.*,better DenyGroups bad.*, worse  Tectia recognizes numerical group IDs as well  but OpenSSH does not :   Tectia AllowGroups 513 DenyGroups 781  By default, access is allowed to all groups. If any AllowGroups keyword appears, access is permitted only to the groups specified  and may be further restricted with DenyGroups .  These directives apply to both the primary group  typically listed in  etc passwd or the corresponding NIS map  and all supplementary groups  in  etc group or an NIS map . If a user is a member of any group that matches a pattern listed by AllowGroups or DenyGroups, then access is restricted accordingly.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.5 Access Control: Letting People In    191   Group access control is often more convenient than restricting specific users, since group memberships can be changed without updating the configuration of the SSH server.  AllowGroups and DenyGroups do not accept hostname qualifiers, however, in contrast to AllowUsers and DenyUsers. This is a surprising and unfortunate inconsistency: if hostname  or IP address  restrictions are useful for controlling access by specific users, then those same restrictions could be even more useful for controling access for entire groups.  As was the case for AllowUsers and DenyUsers, conflicts are resolved in the most restrictive way. If any AllowGroups or DenyGroups line prevents access to a given group, access is denied to that group even if another line appears to permit it.  Hostname Access Control  5.5.3 We’ve described previously how to use hostname qualifiers with AllowUsers and DenyUsers. [5.5.1] For the common case when you don’t need to restrict username, Tectia provides the keywords AllowHosts and DenyHosts to restrict access by host- name  or IP address  more concisely, without wildcards to match usernames:*   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowHosts good.example.com,\i10.1.2.3 DenyHosts bad.example.com, \m10.1.1.0 24   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowHosts good\.example\.com,\i10\.1\.2\.3 DenyHosts bad\.example\.com, \m10.1.1.0 24  As with AllowUsers and DenyUsers:    Patterns are interpreted according to the regular-expression syntax determined  by the metaconfiguration information  Appendix B .    Values may contain multiple strings separated by commas, plus optional  whitespace.  cumulative.    Keywords may appear multiple times in the configuration file, and the results are    Hostnames or IP addresses may be used, with optional \i or \m prefixes.   By default, access is allowed to all hosts, and if any AllowHosts keyword appears, access is permitted only to the hosts specified  and may be further restricted with DenyHosts .  * Finer-grained control is provided by the from option in authorized_keys. [8.2.4] Each public key may be  tagged with a list of acceptable hosts that may connect via that key.  192    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You can also make AllowHosts and DenyHosts do reverse DNS lookups  or not  with the RequireReverseMapping keyword, providing a value of yes or no:   Tectia RequireReverseMapping yes  shosts Access Control  5.5.4 AllowHosts and DenyHosts offer total hostname-based access control, regardless of the type of authentication requested. A similar but less restrictive access control is spe- cific to hostbased authentication. The Tectia server can deny access to hosts that are named in .rhosts, .shosts,  etc hosts.equiv, and  etc shosts.equiv files. This is accom- plished with the keywords AllowSHosts and DenySHosts:*  For example, the line:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax DenySHosts *.badguy.com   Tectia with egrep regex syntax DenySHosts .*\.badguy\.com  forbids access by connections from hosts in the badguy.com domain, but only when hostbased authentication is being attempted. Likewise, AllowSHosts permits access only to given hosts when hostbased authentication is used. Values follow the same syntax as for AllowHosts and DenyHosts. As a result, system administrators can over- ride values in users’ .rhosts and .shosts files  which is good, because this can’t be done via the  etc hosts.equiv or  etc shosts.equiv files .  AllowSHosts and DenySHosts have caveats similar to those of AllowHosts and DenyHosts:    Patterns are interpreted according to the regular-expression syntax determined  by the metaconfiguration information  Appendix B .    Values may contain multiple patterns separated by commas, plus optional  whitespace.  cumulative.    Keywords may appear multiple times in the configuration file, and the results are    Hostnames or IP addresses may be used, with optional \i or \m prefixes.   By default, access is allowed to all hosts, and if any AllowSHosts keyword appears, access is permitted only to the hosts specified  and may be further restricted with DenySHosts .  * Even though the keywords have “SHosts” in their names, they apply also to .rhosts and  etc hosts.equiv files.

All rights reserved.  5.5 Access Control: Letting People In    193   Root Access Control  5.5.5 sshd has a separate access-control mechanism for the superuser. The keyword PermitRootLogin allows or denies access to the root account by SSH:  PermitRootLogin no  Permissible values for this keyword are yes  the default  to allow access to the root account by SSH; no to deny all such access; and without-password  OpenSSH  or nopwd  Tectia  to allow access except by password authentication.  In addition, OpenSSH recognizes the value forced-commands-only to allow access only for forced commands specified in authorized_keys [8.2.3]; Tectia always allows such access for all values of PermitRootLogin. OpenSSH’s level of control is useful, for example, if root’s authorized_keys file contains a line beginning with:  command=" bin dump" ....  Then the root account may be accessed by SSH to run the dump command. This capability lets remote clients run superuser processes, such as backups or filesystem checks, but not unrestricted login sessions.  The server checks PermitRootLogin after authentication is complete. In other words, if PermitRootLogin is no, a client is offered the opportunity to authenticate  e.g., is prompted for a password or passphrase  but is shut down afterward regardless. We’ve previously seen a similar keyword, IgnoreRootRhosts, that controls access to the root account by hostbased authentication. [5.4.4] It prevents entries in ~root .rhosts and ~root .shosts from being used to authenticate root. Because sshd checks PermitRootLogin after authentication is complete, it overrides any value of IgnoreRootRhosts. Table 5-4 illustrates the interaction of these two keywords.  Table 5-4. Can root log in?  PermitRootLogin yes  PermitRootLogin no  PermitRootLogin without-password  OpenSSH ; PermitRootLogin nopwd  Tectia   IgnoreRootRhosts yes Yes, except by hostbased No Yes, except by hostbased or password  IgnoreRootRhosts no Yes No Yes, except by password  External Access Control  5.5.6 Tectia allows access control  authorization  decisions to be made by an external pro- gram, which is identified by the ExternalAuthorizationProgram keyword:*   Tectia ExternalAuthorizationProgram  usr local sbin ssh-external-authorization-program  * If the specified program cannot be run, then access is denied.  194    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The program can be used to implement arbitrary access control logic, extending the mechanisms that are supported directly by the Tectia server.* The server communi- cates with the program using the Tectia plugin protocol, and we’ll go into more detail in a later case study. [11.7.3]  The external authorization program can only veto access controls applied by other keywords in the server’s configuration. This follows the same policy that we have seen earlier: conflicts are always resolved using the most restrictive interpretation.  Restricting Directory Access with chroot  5.5.7 The Unix system call chroot causes a process  and any subprocesses  to treat a given directory as the root directory. After chroot, absolute filenames beginning with “ ” actually refer to subdirectories of the given directory. Access is effectively restricted to the given directory, because it is impossible to name files outside. This is useful for restricting a user or process to a subset of a filesystem for security reasons.  Tectia provides two keywords for imposing this restriction on incoming SSH clients. ChRootUsers specifies that SSH clients, when accessing a given account, are restricted to the account’s home directory and its subdirectories:   Tectia ChRootUsers guest  Values for ChRootUsers use the same syntax as for AllowUsers: [5.5.1]   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax ChRootUsers guest*,backup,300[[:digit:]],visitor@*.friendly.org   Tectia with egrep regex syntax ChRootUsers guest.*,backup,300[[:digit:]],visitor@.*\.friendly\.org  The other keyword, ChRootGroups, works similarly but applies to all accounts that belong to a group that matches any of the specified patterns:   Tectia ChRootGroups guest[a-z],ops,999[[:digit:]]  Values for ChRootGroups use the same syntax as for AllowGroups. [5.5.2]  ChRootUsers and ChRootGroups can be specified multiple times in configuration files; the values are accumulated into a single list for each keyword. Each account that matches a pattern from either ChRootUsers or ChRootGroups is individually restricted when accessed via Tectia.  * The external authorization program is similar in function to a keyboard-interactive plugin that is used for authentication, except that access control does not need interaction with the remote user, because the user has already authenticated successfully before the program is run.

All rights reserved.  5.5 Access Control: Letting People In    195   Files Used by the Tectia Server After chroot  After chroot, the Tectia server needs only minimal access to files. All its configuration files  and subconfiguration files, if any  have already been read, and all authentication and authorization steps completed, before chroot is done. The server therefore needn’t access devices, shared libraries, system configuration files, etc., used during these ear- lier operations. The only files accessed after chroot are related to starting a user session:    Setting up the environment: [5.6.2]   etc environment $HOME .ssh2 environment    The user rc file s  [5.6.3], plus any programs and files used by the scripts:  $HOME .ssh2 rc  etc ssh2 sshrc  if $HOME .ssh2 rc doesn’t exist     X authentication, if no user rc files are found [9.4.5.2], plus any shared libraries,  files, etc., used by xauth:   usr X11R6 bin xauth  or a similar location, possibly determined by XauthPath     Suppressing login messages: [5.6.1]  $HOME .hushlogin    Message of the day: [5.6.1]   etc motd    Checking for mail: [5.6.1]   var spool mail $USER  or a similar location   In most cases, accounts using chroot are heavily restricted and wouldn’t use these fea- tures anyway, so this is rarely a problem. Sometimes the Tectia server uses the original pathname from the passwd database for $HOME after chroot, even though it really should use “ ” instead. This can be fixed by a symbolic link in the user’s home directory  after any necessary parent directories are created :  $ mkdir -p "$HOME$HOME" $ rmdir    "$HOME$HOME" $ ln -s    "$HOME$HOME"  If, for example, $HOME is  home elvis according to the passwd database, then this sets up a symbolic link:   home elvis home elvis ->    After chroot " home elvis" , the symbolic link will cause the original  home elvis path- name to be equivalent to the new root directory, as it should be. Crude but effective!  To make chroot functionality work, all system files used by any programs run via the Tectia server must be copied into the home directory for each restricted account.  196    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Such files can include special device files like  dev null or  dev zero, shared libraries from  lib or  usr lib, configuration files like  etc termcap, etc.  The permissions for the copied system files  and the directories in which they live  need to be carefully controlled. Typically they should not be writable by the owner of the restricted account.  Discovering all of the system files needed for all of the programs used by an account can be challenging, and may require considerable experimentation and debugging: tools that monitor filesystem usage  like lsof, strace, and ldd  can help.* Dependen- cies on shared libraries can be eliminated by statically linking the programs.  Maintenance costs for restricted accounts are minimized if the accounts are further restricted to run only a very limited set of carefully controlled commands. The login shell is typically set to a special-purpose program, or access is allowed only to a col- lection of forced commands. [8.2.3]  Summary of Authentication and Access Control  5.5.8 SSH provides several ways to permit or restrict connections to particular accounts or from particular hosts.

Here, we discuss:    Printing welcome messages for the user   Setting environment variables   Taking arbitrary actions with initialization scripts  5.6.1 Welcome Messages for the User sshd can display custom messages for the user before and after authentication. Before authentication, the SSH server can optionally display the contents of any file you select with the Banner keyword  OpenSSH  or BannerMessageFile keyword  Tectia :   OpenSSH Banner  usr local etc warning.txt   Tectia BannerMessageFile   usr local etc warning.txt  By default, OpenSSH displays no banner message, whereas Tectia displays the con- tents of  etc ssh2 ssh_banner_message if the file exists.* The banner message is often used for legal statements that forbid unauthorized access. Since the file is sent before authentication, be careful that it doesn’t reveal sensitive information.  After authentication, both OpenSSH’s and Tectia’s sshd optionally prints the stan- dard Unix “message of the day” file   etc motd . This output may be turned on and off with the PrintMotd keyword with the value yes  the default  or no:  PrintMotd no  Since most Unix shells print  etc motd on login, this SSH feature is often redundant and turned off.  * SSH clients are not required  by the SSH-2 protocol  to display the message.  198    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   For Tectia, a message about email  e.g., “You have mail”  is printed on login if the CheckMail keyword has the value of yes  the default , or the message is skipped if the value is no:   Tectia CheckMail yes   OpenSSH PrintLastLog yes  In OpenSSH, the last login time is also printed if the PrintLastLog keyword has the value of yes  the default , or the message is skipped if the value is no:  Tectia has no separate keyword to control printing the last login time—it’s always printed, if available.  The SSH server also obeys the Unix hushlogin convention, which allows each user to control whether these welcome messages are printed. If the file ~ .hushlogin exists, then the message of the day, the mail notification message  for Tectia , and the last login time are all omitted.  Setting Environment Variables  5.6.2 As we’ll see later, SSH clients have several ways to set environment variables in the server before the login shell is invoked,* such as the environment file [7.1.3], the SendEnv  OpenSSH  or SetRemoteEnv  Tectia  configuration keywords [7.4.4.3], and the environment option in the authorized_keys  OpenSSH  or authorization  Tectia  file [8.2.5]. However, these changes happen only with the server’s permission; other- wise, SSH clients could circumvent server security policies.  The OpenSSH server grants or denies permission for clients to modify the environ- ment in this manner, using the PermitUserEnvironment and AcceptEnv keywords. PermitUserEnvironment controls whether the server pays attention to the user’s ~ .ssh  environment file and authorized_keys files, with a value of yes or no  the default :   OpenSSH PermitUserEnvironment yes  AcceptEnv controls how the server accepts or rejects environment variables that are sent from the SSH client according to the SendEnv  OpenSSH  or SetRemoteEnv  Tec- tia  keywords. Normally the SSH server pays no attention to such environment vari- ables, but you can use the AcceptEnv keyword to allow specific variables to be copied, with their values, into SSH sessions on the server machine.  The AcceptEnv keyword lists the environment variables that are accepted, either sepa- rated by whitespace or specified by multiple keywords. Wildcard characters * and ? will match classes of environment variables.  * And also before the user rc script, ~ .ssh rc  OpenSSH  or ~ .ssh2 rc  Tectia . [5.6.3]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.6 User Logins and Accounts    199    OpenSSH AcceptEnv LANG LC_* AcceptEnv PATH TERM TZ  Likewise, the Tectia SSH server permits or denies permission for clients to modify the environment prior to login. Its SettableEnvironmentVars keyword lists environ- ment variables that can be set by any of the methods, separated by commas  and optional whitespace , or specified by multiple keywords. The environment variables are matched against patterns. [11.6.1]   Tectia SettableEnvironmentVars LANG,LC_ ALLCOLLATECTYPEMONETARYNUMERICTIME  SettableEnvironmentVars PATH, TERM, TZ  The SettableEnvironmentVars keyword applies only to user-configurable environ- ment variables. Files like  etc environment controlled by the server administrator are not affected.  In all these cases, users are still free to set any environment variables after their login shells are invoked. The restrictions apply only to the mechanisms for initializing the environment of the login shell.  Initialization Scripts  5.6.3 When a user logs in, her Unix shell runs one or more initialization scripts, such as  etc  profile. In addition, sshd runs the script  etc ssh sshrc  OpenSSH  or  etc ssh2 sshrc  Tectia  for each SSH-based login. This feature lets the system administrator run spe- cial commands for SSH logins that don’t occur for ordinary logins. For example, you can do some additional logging of SSH connections, print welcome messages for SSH users only, etc. The  etc ssh sshrc or  etc ssh2 sshrc script is always processed by the Bourne shell   bin  sh , rather than the user’s shell, so it can run reliably for all accounts regardless of their various shells. It is run for logins  e.g., ssh my-host  and remote commands  ssh my- host  bin who , just before the user’s shell or command is invoked but after environ- ment variables are initialized. The script runs in a separate shell, which exits after the script finishes, so it cannot initialize environment variables for the session. The script runs under the target account’s uid, so it can’t take privileged actions. If the script exits due to an error  say, a syntax error , the SSH session continues normally. Note that this file is run as input to the Bourne shell: sshd runs  bin sh  etc ssh sshrc, not  bin sh –c  etc ssh sshrc. This means that it can’t be an arbitrary program; it must be a file containing Bourne-shell commands  and it doesn’t need the execute mode bit set .  etc ssh sshrc or  etc ssh2 sshrc operates machinewide: it is run for every incoming SSH connection. For more fine-grained control, users may create the script ~ .ssh  rc  OpenSSH  or ~ .ssh2 rc  Tectia  to be run instead of the machinewide script  etc ssh sshrc or  etc ssh2 sshrc, respectively. [8.4] The machinewide script isn’t executed if the user-specific script exists in the target account, but a user script can run the machinewide script directly. OpenSSH always runs ~ .ssh rc using the  200    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Bourne shell  like  etc ssh sshrc , but Tectia runs ~ .ssh2 rc using each user’s shell  in contrast to  etc ssh2 sshrc . OpenSSH ignores user scripts if a subsystem is used, but Tectia does not. [5.8] Note that SSH rc files interact with X authentication. [9.4.5.2]  Forwarding  5.7 Forwarding  or tunneling  is the use of SSH to protect another network service. We discuss it in detail in Chapter 9, but here we describe the available serverwide config- uration options.  Port Forwarding  5.7.1 SSH’s forwarding  or tunneling  features protect other TCP IP-based applications by encrypting their connections. We cover forwarding in great detail in Chapter 9, but we introduce here the serverwide configuration keywords for controlling it.  TCP port forwarding can be enabled or disabled by the keyword AllowTcpForwarding, with the value yes  the default  or no:  AllowTcpForwarding no  Tectia can specify this more selectively for particular users or Unix groups, with the keywords DenyTcp- ForwardingForUsers, and DenyTcpForwardingForGroups:  AllowTcpForwardingForGroups,  AllowTcpForwardingForUsers,   Tectia AllowTcpForwardingForUsers smith AllowTcpForwardingForGroups students DenyTcpForwardingForUsers evildoer DenyTcpForwardingForGroups badguys  The values for these keywords use the same syntax as for AllowUsers, AllowGroups, DenyUsers, and DenyGroups, respectively: [5.5.1] [5.5.2]   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax AllowTcpForwardingForUsers good*@*.friendly.org,*@\i10.1.2.*,12[[:digit:]] DenyTcpForwardingForGroups bad*,33[[:digit:]]   Tectia with egrep regex syntax AllowTcpForwardingForUsers good.*@.*\.friendly\.org,.*@\i10\.1\.2\.*,12[[:digit:]] DenyTcpForwardingForGroups bad.*,33[[:digit:]]  Tectia’s ForwardACL keyword provides the most precise access control for specific for- wardings.* Its use is complicated but it provides great flexibility. It uses multiple val- ues  separated by whitespace , with the general format:   Tectia ForwardACL access direction client forward [originator]  * ACL stands for “access control list.”  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Either local or remote, specifying the kind of forwarding being controlled.*  A pattern describing the SSH client, with the same syntax as the UserSpecificConfig keyword, with the components user[%group][@chost]: [11.6.2] user  Matches the username requested by the client   Optional  Matches any of the groups that claim the user as a member   Optional  Matches the machine from which the SSH connection origi- nates, i.e., where the SSH client program runs  For local forwardings, a pattern that matches the forwarding target, where the application server runs, as shown in Figure 5-3, which illustrates the result of running the command:†  chost$ ssh -L[faddr:]fport:thost:tport shost  The local forward value has the form thost[%tport], where the thost compo- nent uses the same syntax as the AllowHost keyword, and matches either the hostname provided by the SSH client, or the address resulting from the host- name lookup that is performed by the SSH server for the forwarding. The optional tport is a pattern matching the numeric value of the port on which the application server is listening, and to which the SSH server connects for the for- warding. If the port is not specified, then the access control applies to all ports. For remote forwardings, the forward value matches the address and  optionally  the port on which the SSH server listens for forwarded connections, as shown in Figure 5-4, which illustrates the result of running the command:  chost$ ssh -R[faddr:]fport:thost:tport shost  The remote forward value uses the same syntax as for local forwardings, with the components faddr[%fport].  * These keywords are case-insensitive, but the documentation mentions only lowercase, so we recommend it. † Only Tectia SSH clients allow the listening address faddr to be specified with the forwarding command-line  options –L and –R.  202    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Remote forwarding with the Tectia ForwardACL keyword  For local forwarding, the SSH server must rely on the SSH client to provide the source address, and a malicious client might forge the address, so it really can’t be trusted as a basis for granting access. In addition, the source address reported by the SSH client might belong to private address space that is not meaningful to the SSH server, e.g., if network address translation  NAT  is used. The ForwardACL keyword is one of the most complex keywords available for con- figuring Tectia, because so many parameters are needed to describe forwarded connections fully. The reward for conquering this complexity is precision. For  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Note that no restrictions are imposed on the listening port for local forwardings  2001 in this case ; the SSH server has no reason to care about that, and no way to verify it anyway.  To allow guest users  i.e., those whose usernames start with “guest”  initiating SSH connections from a range of addresses described by the netmask 10.1.2.0 24 to use remote forwarding, but only listening on the localhost interface and accepting for- warded connections on a range of ports 7000-7009:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax ForwardACL allow remote guest*@\m10.1.2.0 24 localhost:700[[:digit:]]   Tectia with egrep regex syntax ForwardACL allow remote guest.*@\m10.1.2.0 24 localhost:700[[:digit:]]  The user guest33 could then run his SSH client on a host with address 10.1.2.3 as:   Tectia $ ssh -Rlocalhost:7005:server.elsewhere.net:8080 ssh.example.com  Note that there are no restrictions on the target for the forwarding  port 8080 on server.elsewhere.net ; the SSH server again neither knows nor cares about the for- warded connection on the SSH client side.  To relax this access control, allowing the SSH server to accept connections on any listening address, but only from application clients originating forwarded connec- tions from hosts in the outbound.example.com domain, replace the localhost compo- nent in the previous forward pattern with a “match anything” wildcard, and add a fifth originator pattern:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax ForwardACL allow remote guest*@\m10.1.2.0 24 *:700[[:digit:]] *.outbound.example.com   Tectia with egrep regex syntax ForwardACL allow remote guest.*@\m10.1.2.0 24 .*:700[[:digit:]] .*\.outbound\. example\.com  ForwardACL restrictions for local and remote forwardings are completely indepen- dent. If any ForwardACL keywords allow specific, limited access for either kind of for- warding, then all other access for that kind of forwarding will be denied.  204    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia uses the most restrictive interpretation for forwarding access control: if multi- ple ForwardACL keywords match a requested forwarding, and any of them deny access, then the forwarding is rejected. This can be useful for creating exceptions. For example, to allow local forwarding to any port on any target host in the example. com domain, but not to any port on the database server db.example.com, or to http servers  port 80  on any example.com hosts:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax ForwardACL allow local  *  *.example.com ForwardACL deny  local  * db.example.com ForwardACL deny  local  *  *.example.com%80   Tectia with egrep regex syntax ForwardACL allow local .* .*\.example\.com ForwardACL deny  local .* db\.example\.com ForwardACL deny  local .* .*\.example\.com%80  access  Furthermore, ForwardACL keywords cannot override restrictions imposed by the other forwarding AllowTcp- ForwardingForGroups, DenyTcpForwardingForUsers, DenyTcpForwardingForGroups, or AllowTcpForwarding : if any of these applicable keywords deny access for a requested forwarding, then the forwarding is forbidden.   AllowTcpForwardingForUsers,  control keywords  X Forwarding  5.7.2 Forwarding for X, the popular Window System, can be separately enabled or dis- abled with the keyword X11Forwarding:*  X11Forwarding no  OpenSSH automatically disables X11Forwarding if UseLogin is enabled. [5.4.10]  Administrators may wish to disable forwarding for users who are not trusted to have forwarding securely configured on the client side. For example, it is usually desirable to avoid SSH clients that indiscriminately accept connections from anywhere, and then forward them across SSH tunnels to trusted servers. Similarly, misconfigured X servers  which run on the SSH client side  can expose X client programs running on the SSH server side to attack, if the X server access is overly permissive.  Disabling forwarding isn’t effective for users who are granted shell access to run arbi- trary commands, because such users can use their own programs to set up equiva- lent forwarding functionality. For better control, set up special-purpose accounts that use carefully written, restricted programs instead of standard shells, and con- sider using subsystems. [5.8]  * Tectia supports the keywords ForwardX11 and AllowX11Forwarding as synonyms for X11Forwarding.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.7 Forwarding    205   Agent Forwarding  5.7.3 Agent forwarding permits a series of SSH connections  from one machine to another to another, ...  to operate seamlessly using a single agent. [6.3.5] Agent forwarding may be the keyword AllowAgentForwarding with a value of yes  the default  or no:*  enabled or disabled in the Tectia  server using   Tectia AllowAgentForwarding no  It may also be enabled or disabled by OpenSSH and Tectia clients. [6.3.5.3]  Agent forwarding is convenient, but in a security-sensitive environment, it might be appropriate to disable this feature. Because forwarded agent connections are imple- mented as Unix domain sockets, an attacker can conceivably gain access to them. These sockets are just nodes in the filesystem, protected only by file permissions that can be compromised.  For example, suppose you maintain a network of exposed, untrusted machines that you access from a more secure network using SSH. You might consider disabling agent forwarding on the untrusted machines. Otherwise, an attacker can compro- mise an untrusted machine; take control of a forwarded agent from a legitimate, incoming SSH connection; and use the agent’s loaded keys to gain access to the secure network via SSH.  The attacker can’t retrieve the keys themselves in this way, however.   Subsystems  5.8 Subsystems are a layer of abstraction for defining and running remote commands via SSH.† Normally remote commands are specified ad hoc on the client command line. For example, the following command runs a script to perform tape backups:  $ ssh server.example.com  usr local sbin tape-backups  Subsystems are a set of remote commands predefined on the server machine, with simple names so that they can be executed conveniently.  The syntax to define subsystems in the server configuration file is slightly different for OpenSSH and Tectia. A subsystem for the preceding backup command is:   OpenSSH Subsystem backups    usr local sbin tape-backups   Tectia Subsystem-backups    usr local sbin tape-backups  * The keyword ForwardAgent is also supported as a synonym for backward compatibility. † Subsystems are supported only by the SSH-2 protocol.  206    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Note that OpenSSH uses the keyword Subsystem with a separate value for the sub- system name, whereas Tectia uses a keyword of the form Subsystem-name. This Tec- tia syntax is quite odd and unlike anything else in its configuration language; we don’t know how it ended up that way.  To run this tape backup script on the server machine, use the ssh -s option:  $ ssh server.example.com -s backups  This command behaves identically to the previous one in which the script was speci- fied explicitly.  Subsystems are mainly a convenience feature to predefine commands for SSH clients to invoke easily. The additional level of abstraction is useful for system administra- tors, who can hide  and therefore easily change  details for the subsystem com- mands. For example, the backups subsystem could be changed to use a completely different script, without any changes in the ssh client command that operators run to perform tape backups.  System administrators can also define and advertise more generally useful sub- systems. Suppose your users run the Pine email reader to connect to your IMAP server to secure the connection. [11.3] Instead of telling everyone to use the command:  $ ssh server.example.com  usr sbin imapd  and revealing the path to the IMAP daemon, imapd, you can define an imap sub- system to hide the path in case it changes in the future:   OpenSSH Subsystem imap   usr sbin imapd   Tectia Subsystem-imap   usr sbin imapd Now users can run the command:  $ ssh server.example.com -s imap  to establish secure IMAP connections via the subsystem.  Subsystems are especially useful for tunneling other protocols. If clients refer only to a subsystem, the corresponding server implementation can be changed without mod- ifying  and redeploying  the clients, which might be numerous and widely scattered.  The best example is the sftp subsystem, which provides secure file transfers. [2.7.1] The sftp client runs ssh -s sftp to launch an sftp-server program and set up a secure tunnel for communication between the client and server.* The default server configu- ration file for both OpenSSH and Tectia contains a definition of the sftp subsystem, with the correct, absolute pathname for sftp-server. Tectia also provides an internal  * Tectia’s scp client also uses the sftp subsystem.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.8 Subsystems    207   implementation of the sftp subsystem that is built into the SSH server itself. This can be selected by using a special syntax for the command:   Tectia Subsystem-sftp  internal:  sftp-server  The internal sftp subsystem is much more convenient than the default  external  sftp-server command for accounts that are subject to chroot restrictions. [5.5.7]  Subsystem commands are executed by each user’s shell, and they can be affected by environment variables set by the user  if permitted by the server [5.6.2] , shell start- up scripts, etc. OpenSSH avoids running the ~ .ssh rc script for subsystems, but Tec- tia always runs ~ .ssh2 rc. If a subsystem server command uses a special token to mark the start of its output, clients can ignore unexpected output from user scripts. Of course, the token must be defined as part of the protocol that’s understood and used by the client and server.  OpenSSH requires that subsystem commands use absolute filenames, since no PATH search is performed. If a relative filename is used, e.g.:   OpenSSH: this does not work Subsystem backups   tape-backups  then no error occurs when the server configuration file is read, but on subsequent attempts to use the subsystem, clients fail silently, and the server emits syslog warnings:  Dec 20 14:14:47 server.example.com sshd[1554]: error: subsystem: cannot stat tape- backups: No such file or directory  Furthermore, OpenSSH doesn’t permit command-line arguments for subsystem commands:   OpenSSH: this does not work Subsystem backups    usr local sbin tape-backups --full --filesystem= home  This restriction is enforced when the server configuration file is read:   etc ssh sshd_config line 99: garbage at end of line; "--full".  Tectia is more permissive. The server searches for simple commands  i.e., relative filenames and no command-line arguments  in the libexec and bin subdirectories of the Tectia install directory, and then searches each directory in the PATH. Absolute filenames are still recommended, however, since the PATH can be redefined or modi- fied by each user, and  if not set explicitly  defaults to the value inherited when the server was started.  Tectia also allows extra arguments or even shell metacharacters in subsystem commands:   Tectia Subsystem-backups    usr local sbin tape-backups --full 2>&1  tee  var log backups  208    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This is usually a bad idea, because various shells for individual users differ in their interpretation of metacharacters  e.g., the 2>&1 notation in the previous example is understood only by Bourne-style shells . The SSH server configuration file is the wrong place for this complexity: a better approach is to wrap the details in a sepa- rate script, and use the name of that script as the subsystem command.  Subsystem keywords can be repeated to define multiple, independent subsystems. OpenSSH can define a maximum of 256 subsystems; there is no limit for Tectia. OpenSSH refuses to allow subsystem names to be reused:   etc ssh sshd_config line 98: Subsystem 'backups' already defined.  Tectia uses later subsystem definitions with the same name to override the com- mands from earlier definitions. This can be useful in conjunction with subconfigura- tion files. [11.6.2]  OpenSSH subsystem names are case-sensitive. In contrast, Tectia maps subsystem names to lowercase when the configuration file is read, but then uses case-sensitive comparisons to look up the subsystems specified by clients. This unfortunate and confusing behavior effectively restricts Tectia subsystem names to be all lowercase.*  The IETF SECSH draft only defines the “sftp” subsystem name and mandates that other, nonstandard names use an @ suffix to identify the domain that defined the subsystem:   OpenSSH Subsystem smail@example.com      usr local sbin secure-mail-server   Tectia Subsystem-smail@example.com      usr local sbin secure-mail-server  This convention should be followed to avoid name clashes for software that is widely used, but the domain suffix is commonly omitted for subsystems that are used only within a single organization, and the convention is not enforced.  Logging and Debugging  5.9 As an SSH server runs, it optionally produces log messages to describe what it’s doing. Log messages aid the system administrator in tracking the server’s behavior and detecting and diagnosing problems. For example, if a server is mysteriously rejecting connections, one of the first places to look is the server’s log output.  * We suspect this is a consequence of Tectia’s peculiar syntax for the Subsystem keyword in server configura- tion files. Keywords are case-insensitive, and it’s therefore consistent to ignore the case of the subsystem name when the name is appended to the keyword.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.9 Logging and Debugging    209   By default, the SSH server writes log messages to syslog, the standard Unix logging service  see the sidebar, “The Syslog Logging Service” . For example, an SSH server typically announces its startup with log messages like:*  Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 22. Generating 768 bit RSA key. RSA key generation complete.  and a connection from a client is recorded with log messages like:  session opened for user rebecca by  uid=9005  Accepted publickey for rebecca from 10.1.2.3 port 1265 ssh2 session closed for user rebecca  The SyslogFacility keyword specifies how the SSH server tags log messages:  SyslogFacility LOCAL3  The value is one of the  case-insensitive  syslog facility codes, and the default is AUTH.  The Syslog Logging Service  Syslog is the standard Unix logging service. Programs send their log messages to the syslog daemon, syslogd, which forwards them to other destinations such as files, the system console, or even other machines. Destinations are specified in the syslog con- figuration file,  etc syslog.conf. Messages received by syslogd are processed according to their facility, which indicates their origin. Standard syslog facilities include AUTH  security and authorization , AUTHPRIV  similar, but for sensitive information , DAEMON  system daemons , LOCAL0 through LOCAL7  reserved for local use , and USER  user processes . Log messages are also assigned a priority level, which indicates their importance. The standard syslog priorities are, in order from most to least important, EMERG, ALERT, CRIT, ERR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, and DEBUG. See the manpages for syslog, syslogd, and syslog.conf for more information about this logging service.  Tectia confusingly interprets AUTH to actually mean AUTHPRIV  this also applies to the default behavior , and does not recognize AUTHPRIV as a syslog facility code. On systems that do not support a separate AUTHPRIV facility, Tectia resorts to AUTH. Otherwise, Tectia provides no way to specify the AUTH facility explicitly.  * The system logger adds other information to each log message, such as a timestamp, the name of the  machine, and the process ID of the SSH server, so lines in the log files will actually look like:  Aug 30 17:41:47 graceland sshd[731]: Illegal user elvis from 10.11.12.13  210    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   For Tectia, a separate syslog facility code is used for the sftp subsystem. [5.8] This is specified by the SftpSysLogFacility keyword:   Tectia SftpSysLogFacility LOCAL7  By default, no logging is performed for sftp.  If the sftp subsystem is implemented by an external program, then the Tectia server passes the sftp syslog facility code via the environment variable SSH2_SFTP_LOG_FACILITY. Otherwise, if the internal sftp sub- system that is built into the server is used, then the value for the SftpSysLogFacility keyword is consulted directly.  SSH servers use a range of syslog priority levels, depending on the types of log mes- sages that are sent. These priority levels aren’t directly controllable, but the syslog configuration determines where and how they are recorded  or discarded . The amount of detail provided by log messages can be specified in a variety of ways, however. OpenSSH uses the keyword LogLevel to control the verbosity level:  The permitted values  in order of increasing verbosity  are QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, and DEBUG1 through DEBUG3.*  The QUIET level sends nothing whatsoever to the system log  although some mes- sages resulting from OpenSSH activity may still be recorded by other programs and libraries, such as PAM . Tectia uses a separate keyword, QuietMode, to suppress all log messages  except fatal errors , with the values yes or no  the default :   OpenSSH LogLevel VERBOSE   Tectia QuietMode yes  $ sshd -q  The –q command-line option also selects quiet operation:  OpenSSH Logging and Debugging  5.9.1 For OpenSSH, the LogLevel values DEBUG1 through DEBUG3 produce voluminous infor- mation useful only for diagnostic purposes.† These levels are sufficiently verbose to reveal sensitive personal information that should not normally be recorded, so avoid them for routine operation. Debugging output is usually requested on the command line:   OpenSSH $ sshd -o "LogLevel DEBUG2"  * These names are not syslog priority levels, although some of the names are similar. † DEBUG is a synonym for DEBUG1.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.9 Logging and Debugging    211   More concisely, the –d command-line option can be specified one to three times, to set the LogLevel to DEBUG1 through DEBUG3, respectively:   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -d  DEBUG2 level  The –t  test  option causes the OpenSSH server to start up, check the validity of its host keys and the server configuration file, and exit. [5.2.2] Combine it with –d to see more details about successful operation:   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -t debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_3.9p1 debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA debug1: private host key: 0 type 1 RSA debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA debug1: private host key: 1 type 2 DSA  For OpenSSH, the –d command-line option also causes the server to run in “debug mode,” which alters its behavior to support debugging. The LogLevel keyword does not enable debug mode—it only sets the verbosity level.  In debug mode, the OpenSSH server runs in the foreground, without forking, instead of running detached as a daemon. Normally, the server forks again after it accepts each connection from a client, and continues further work for the session in a sepa- rate child process, while the parent process resumes listening for more connection requests. In debug mode, however, the OpenSSH server handles only a single con- nection, again without forking, and then exits. This is usually convenient for debug- ging, when forking and multiple processes are unwelcome complications; it’s often easier to determine what’s happening if all actions are performed by a single process.  OpenSSH doesn’t bother to record its process ID in the PidFile [5.3.1.3] when it runs in debug mode, since no forking occurs, and it’s easy to determine the process ID if the server needs to be signaled.  OpenSSH can also be prevented from running as a daemon by using the –D command-line option:   OpenSSH $ sshd -D  The –D option does not change the LogLevel or enable any of the other side effects of debug mode. The OpenSSH server still forks to handle multiple client connections, even when –D is specified.  The –D option is handy in special circumstances when some other process needs to monitor the OpenSSH server, and would incorrectly conclude that sshd had exited if it forked and ran in the background. For example, the Cygwin program cygrunsrv uses sshd -D to launch OpenSSH as a Windows service. [14.1]  212    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In debug mode, the OpenSSH server prints log messages to the standard error, instead of sending them to syslog. For example, we can use the –p option to test the server without disturbing normal operation on the standard port: [5.3.3.1]   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -p 2222 debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_3.5p1 debug1: private host key: 0 type 0 RSA1 debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA debug1: private host key: 1 type 1 RSA debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA debug1: private host key: 2 type 2 DSA debug1: rexec_argv[0]=' usr sbin sshd' debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-d' debug1: rexec_argv[2]='-p' debug1: rexec_argv[3]='2222' debug1: Bind to port 2222 on 0.0.0.0.

The server waits for an incoming connection request, and then ... debug1: Server will not fork when running in debugging mode. debug1: rexec start in 4 out 4 newsock 4 pipe -1 sock 7 ... Further debug output is sent to syslog: see below ...  Log messages that would have been sent to syslog are printed directly. Extra debug messages are printed with the debug1 prefix  or debug2 or debug3 if more verbose debugging log levels are used . Lots of sample output from sshd -d can be found in Chapter 3.  The –e option causes the OpenSSH server to independently redirect syslog output to the standard error, without all of the other side effects of debug mode. For example:   OpenSSH $ sshd -D -e -p 2222 Server listening on 0.0.0.0 port 2222. Accepted publickey for rebecca from 10.1.2.3 port 32788 ssh2 ...  When debugging OpenSSH, it’s usually a good idea to disable server restarts with the undocumented –r option, again to confine all activity to a single process for sim- plicity, and to prevent debug output from being diverted from stderr to syslog after the restart. [5.3.3.3] In the previous example for sshd -d, debug output lines that mention rexec refer to server restarts, and debug output sent to stderr abruptly ends after the rexec start line. If we repeat the example with the –r option, we see much more debugging information sent to stderr, without any of the rexec clutter:   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -r -p 2222 debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_3.9p1 debug1: private host key: 0 type 0 RSA1 debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA debug1: private host key: 1 type 1 RSA  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Alternately, if the restart mechanism itself is being debugged, the –e option can be used to prevent the diversion of debug output from syslog to stderr after the server restarts:   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -e -p 2222 debug1: sshd version OpenSSH_3.9p1 debug1: private host key: 0 type 0 RSA1 debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA debug1: private host key: 1 type 1 RSA debug1: read PEM private key done: type DSA debug1: private host key: 2 type 2 DSA debug1: rexec_argv[0]=' usr sbin sshd' debug1: rexec_argv[1]='-d' debug1: rexec_argv[2]='-e' debug1: rexec_argv[3]='-p' debug1: rexec_argv[4]='2222' debug1: Bind to port 2222 on 0.0.0.0.

When the OpenSSH server is running in debug mode, extra information is also sent to  and displayed by  the client, such as environment variables, initialization scripts, xauth actions, etc., which aid in debugging connection problems.  For example, a connection to the server on the alternate port shown earlier produces diagnostic output like this:  $ ssh -p 2222 server.example.com Environment:  USER=elvis  LOGNAME=elvis  HOME= u elvis  PATH= usr local bin: bin: usr bin  MAIL= var mail elvis  SHELL= bin tcsh  SSH_CLIENT=10.1.2.3 1059 2222  SSH_CONNECTION=10.1.2.3 1059 10.4.5.6 2222  SSH_TTY= dev pts 2  TERM=xterm  DISPLAY=localhost:10.0  SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-XXg0cfvG agent.1989 Running  bin tcsh -c ' bin sh .ssh rc'   ... or ...

Tectia Logging and Debugging  5.9.2 Debug mode for Tectia is also controlled by the –d command-line option,* but the option requires an argument indicating the debug level.  We strongly recommend compiling Tectia with heavy debugging turned on, using the --enable-debug-heavy configure option. [4.3.5.9] The resulting log messages are far more detailed than those printed by default.  Debug levels may be indicated in a variety of ways. The simplest is a nonnegative integer:   Tectia $ sshd -d 2  * The –d option has no corresponding keyword.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.9 Logging and Debugging    215   Specifying a debug level means that messages for all lower levels will be printed as well. Higher numbers indicate increased verbosity. The approximate meanings of the integer debug levels are:  Level 0–2 3  4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11–15  Approximate meaning Software malfunctions Non-fatal, high-level errors caused by data received from the network Successful, high-level operations Start of high-level operations Uncommon situations that might indicate bugs Successful, mid-level operations Data block dumps Protocol packet dumps Successful, low-level operations Miscellaneous, extremely low-level operations  The –v command line option is equivalent to –d 2:   Tectia $ sshd -v   Tectia VerboseMode yes  Alternatively, the VerboseMode keyword  or the abbreviated synonym Verbose  is equivalent to the –v option:  Since debug logging isn’t recommended for normal operation, the VerboseMode key- word is useful primarily in alternate configuration files that are specified with the –f command-line option [5.2.1], or in subconfiguration files. [11.6.2]  The integer debug levels affect all aspects of Tectia’s operation. Debug levels can also be set differently for each module in the Tectia source distribution. This permits much finer-grained control over logging.  To use module-based debugging effectively, you should have some understanding of C programming, and consult the source code  especially the header file lib sshutil  sshcore sshdebug.h . Each source file is considered to be a “module” for debugging purposes, as determined by the definition of SSH_DEBUG_MODULE within the file. For example, the file apps ssh authspasswd.c has the module name Ssh2AuthPasswdServer because it contains the line:  define SSH_DEBUG_MODULE "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer"  216    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The complete set of module names for Tectia at press time is found in Appendix C. To extract the current set of module names from the source code, search for SSH_ DEBUG_MODULE definitions in all source files from within the Tectia distribution:  $ find . -type f -print  xargs grep "define.*SSH_DEBUG_MODULE"  Module names are case-sensitive. Once you have identified the name of your desired module, run the server in debug mode, providing the module’s name and debug level. For example, to cause the Ssh2AuthPasswdServer module to log at debug level 2:  If the debug level is omitted  i.e., only the module name is specified , then the debug level is taken to be zero, so either of the following forms can be used:  The special module name global refers to all modules, and is equivalent to specify- ing an integer debug level. For example, the following two commands function iden- tically:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2"   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer" $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=0"   Tectia $ sshd -d "global=2" $ sshd -d 2  The default global debug level is zero.  Multiple modules may be specified, separated by commas, each set to individual debug levels:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2,SshAdd=3,SshSftpServer=5"  Add whitespace to improve readability:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer = 2, SshAdd = 3, SshSftpServer = 5"  If the –d option is repeated, the debug levels are concatenated. This is an alternative to comma-separated lists:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2" -d "SshAdd=3" -d "SshSftpServer=5"  More generally, module names are patterns that can contain the wildcards * and ? to match multiple modules:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2Auth*=3"  These two wildcards have the same meaning as for zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax, but debug module patterns are not full regu- lar expressions: no other wildcards or regex syntax is recognized.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.9 Logging and Debugging    217   Remember to enclose wildcards for the patterns in quotes to prevent their expansion by the Unix shell.  Wildcards cannot match the special global module name, so the following does not work:   Tectia: does not work $ sshd -d "glo*=2"  Setting the global debug level  using either a simple integer or the special global module name  causes all earlier module debug level assignments to be ignored, so global assignments should always be specified first:   Tectia $ sshd -d 1 -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2,SshAdd=3,SshSftpServer=5" $ sshd -d "global=1, Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2,SshAdd=3,SshSftpServer=5"  The global debug level is used as the default for all modules; otherwise, the debug level for a specific module is determined by the last match in the list. This rule, when combined with wildcards, can be used to conveniently set debug levels for entire cat- egories of modules, by overriding earlier, more general assignments with a sequence of increasingly specific patterns. For example:   Tectia $ sshd -d "global = 1, Ssh2* = 2, Ssh2Auth* = 3, Ssh2AuthPasswd* = 4"  The “match anything” pattern * functions similarly to the global debug level:   Tectia $ sshd -d "* = 1, Ssh2* = 2, Ssh2Auth* = 3, Ssh2AuthPasswd* = 4"  Debug output lines always start with the word “debug,” followed by the process ID in square brackets. Messages for specific modules mention the module name, and provide the name of the source file  with a line number  in which the code is found, plus the name of the function in which they occur. For example:   Tectia $ sshd -d "Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2" ... debug[2665]: Ssh2AuthPasswdServer auths-passwd.c:136 ssh_server_auth_passwd: password auth. debug[2665]: Ssh2AuthPasswdServer auths-passwd.c:138 ssh_server_auth_passwd: op = 0 user = elvis ... debug[2665]: Ssh2AuthPasswdServer auths-passwd.c:250 ssh_server_auth_passwd: ssh_ server_auth_passwd: accepted by local passwd ...  Some debug output isn’t associated with any module, and is printed for all debug levels. In addition, some modules produce output even for debug level 0:   Tectia $ sshd -d 0 debug[3320]: Host key pair is not specified, trying to use default 'hostkey'. debug[3320]: Becoming server.  218    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

You may find that turning on debugging for specific modules doesn’t produce any extra debugging output.  The sshd-check-conf program [5.2.2] also accepts the debug options –d and –v. Use the module names SshdCheckConf, SshConfigParse, or SshConfig to see more details about parsing of configuration files:   Tectia $ sshd-check-conf -d "SshConfigParse=9" debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:224 ssh_parse_config_ext: Got metaconfig line ` REGEX-SYNTAX egrep'. debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:246 ssh_parse_config_ext: Metaconfig specifies regex style 'EGREP'. debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:252 ssh_parse_config_ext: Metaconfig parsing stopped at line 3. debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:464 ssh_config_parse_line: n_var = `Port', n_ val = `22' debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:464 ssh_config_parse_line: n_var = `SettableEnvironmentVars', n_val = `LANG,LC_  ALLCOLLATECTYPEMONETARYNUMERICTIME ,PATH,TERM,TZ' debug: SshConfigParse sshconfig_parse.c:464 ssh_config_parse_line: n_var = `subsystem-sftp', n_val = `sftp-server' ...  As for OpenSSH, the –d command-line option causes the Tectia server to run in the foreground, processing a single connection, and then exiting.  Although the VerboseMode keyword is equivalent to the –v option, which in turn means the same as –d 2, the keyword cannot prevent forking if it is used in a subconfiguration file [11.6.2], because forking will have already occurred when the subconfiguration file is read. Therefore, VerboseMode in a subconfiguration file only determines the debug level. In the main configuration file, the keyword controls fork- ing too.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  5.9 Logging and Debugging    219   To continue listening for more connections, use the –D option instead of –d:   Tectia $ sshd -D "Ssh*TCP*=8"  When the Tectia server is started with the –D option, it runs in the foreground, but subsequently forks to spawn a separate child process to handle the session for each client connection. In all other respects, the –D and –d options function identically.  Tectia doesn’t provide any means to run the server in the foreground without enabling debug mode. However, debug output can be minimized by using the –D option with a debug level of zero, and the relatively small amount of unneeded debug information can be discarded:   Tectia $ sshd -D 0 2>  dev null  If you need this quieter mode of operation frequently, consider rebuilding the server without debugging support. [4.3.5.9]  When specifying debug options  –d, –D, or –v  on the sshd command line, list them first so that debugging output starts as early as possible. This is especially important if you are investigating the parsing of com- mand-line options or configuration files.  Tectia always sends debug output to the standard error, distinct from the messages sent to syslog. In debug mode, messages continue to be sent to syslog as they are for normal operation, but these messages are also copied to the standard error, and intermingled with the debug output. The copied syslog messages are annotated with the name of the Tectia server program  usually “sshd2”  instead of “debug,” and they are unaffected by the debug level:   Tectia $ sshd -d 0 sshd2[3320]: Listener created on  *** SSH_IPADDR_ANY ***:22. sshd2[3320]: Daemon is running. sshd2[3320]: connection from "10.1.2.3"  listen iface: *** SSH_IPADDR_ANY ***:22  ... sshd2[3320]: Destroying session channel 0 sshd2[3320]: Local disconnected: Connection closed. sshd2[3320]: connection lost: 'Connection closed.' sshd2[3320]: Logout for user elvis.  If syslog output is not desired when debugging Tectia, it can be directed to some sys- log facility that is discarded by syslogd:   Tectia $ sshd -d 0 -o "SysLogFacility LOCAL3"  The Tectia server catches the signal SIGUSR1 after it accepts a connection from a client, and finishes authentication and authorization. When SIGUSR1 is received, the server prints detailed information about the connection to its standard error stream. This is  220    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   useful only when the server is running in the foreground  i.e., with the –d or –D options , since output to stderr is discarded when sshd is running in the background, as a daemon.  If the –d option is used, no forking occurs, and SIGUSR1 can be sent to the single server process anytime after the single session starts. For the –D option, however, a separate child process is used for each connection, and SIGUSR1 must be sent to chil- dren, not the original parent process that continues to listen for connections:*   Tectia $ sshd -D 0 -p 2222 ... debug[1234]: Becoming server. debug[1234]: Creating listener s  sshd2[1234]: Listener created on  *** SSH_IPADDR_ANY ***:2222. debug[1234]: Listeners created debug[1234]: no udp listener created. sshd2[1234]: Daemon is running. ... sshd2[5678]: Public key authentication for user elvis accepted. sshd2[5678]: User elvis  uid 501 , coming from client.friendly.org, authenticated. sshd2[5678]: Received a channel open request, type session, channel id 0 sshd2[5678]: Received a session channel extension request of type x11-req for channel number 0 sshd2[5678]: Received a session channel extension request of type exec for channel number 0 ...  Here the parent process that is listening for connections is 1234, while the child that accepted the connection is 5678.

The content and format are similar to information sent by the OpenSSH server, except for Tec- tia’s annotations identifying debug and  copied  syslog messages, with the process ID of the server after it forks to launch the user’s shell:   Tectia $ ssh -p 2222 server.example.com debug[2045]:  etc nologin_server.example.com does not exist. sshd2[2045]: Now running on elvis's privileges. debug[2045]: Environment: debug[2045]:   HOME= u elvis debug[2045]:   USER=elvis debug[2045]:   LOGNAME=elvis debug[2045]:   PATH= usr local bin: bin: usr bin: usr X11R6 bin debug[2045]:   MAIL= var spool mail elvis debug[2045]:   SHELL= bin tcsh debug[2045]:   SSH2_CLIENT=10.1.2.3 32781 10.1.2.3 2222 debug[2045]:   DISPLAY=server.example.com:10.0  222    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

It is necessary for sshd to avoid sending any extra debugging output to the standard error, since it would be relayed by inetd or xinetd to the SSH client along with the normal SSH protocol conversation, messing it up and causing the connection to fail.  OpenSSH forces all debug output to be sent to syslog if the –i option is used, which neatly solves the problem. For Tectia, however, the easiest approach is to redirect the debug output from the standard error to a file. Because many versions of inetd or xinetd do not support shell metacharacters in their configuration files, it’s best to use a short shell script to invoke sshd with the redirected output:  ! bin sh  redirect Tectia sshd standard error to a file exec  usr local sbin sshd -d 2 -i 2>  tmp sshd2.debug  Simply specify this shell script in place of sshd in the inetd or xinetd configuration files.  Alternately, you can send debug output to syslog using the logger program:  ! bin sh  send Tectia sshd debug output to syslog exec  usr local sbin sshd -d 2 -i 2>&1  grep "^debug"  logger -p local3.debug  grep selects only the debug output, discarding the duplicate syslog messages that are also sent to the standard error in debug mode.  5.10 Compatibility Between SSH-1  and SSH-2 Servers  OpenSSH supports both the SSH-1 and SSH-2 protocols within a single daemon accepting both types of connections. The Protocol keyword can be used to limit the support to either protocol exclusively. [5.3.7]  For Tectia, however, the story is more complicated. The Tectia server itself only sup- ports the SSH-2 protocol, but it can accept connections from clients that request the  5.10 Compatibility Between SSH-1 and SSH-2 Servers    223  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   older SSH-1 protocol. This backward compatibility is achieved by having the Tectia server run some other server program for the SSH-1 protocol instead, whenever an SSH-1 connection is requested. This feature is enabled and disabled with the Tectia Ssh1Compatibility keyword, given a value of yes or no  the default :   Tectia Ssh1Compatibility yes  When Ssh1Compatibility is enabled, and an SSH-1 client connects to the Tectia server, the two programs exchange strings indicating their versions. [3.6.3] sshd  also known as sshd2, see the sidebar “Tectia’s File-Naming Conventions” [5.1]  then locates the sshd1 executable by examining the value of the Sshd1Path key- word:   Tectia Sshd1Path  usr local sbin sshd1  and invokes sshd1. The Tectia server adds the –i option [5.3.3.2] to the sshd1 com- mand line to indicate that the client connection has already been accepted by Tectia, and sshd1 should expect the socket to be attached to its standard input, output, and error streams. In addition, the Tectia server passes the client’s version string using the  mostly undocumented  –V command-line option:   Tectia, invoked automatically by sshd  usr local sbin sshd1 -i -V "client version string"    Although sshd2 can accept and reroute SSH-1 client connections, the reverse isn’t true: sshd1 can’t accept SSH-2 connections.  The –V command-line option is supported by sshd1 implementations for internal use only by sshd2. It is necessary because when sshd1 starts this way, the client has already sent its initial version announcement, which sshd1 needs to get somehow. We can’t think of any practical reason to use this option manually, but we mention it here for completeness.  The OpenSSH server also implements the –V option, so you could use OpenSSH to handle SSH-1 protocol connections that are delegated from Tectia in its backward- compatibility mode. Be sure to set OpenSSH’s Protocol keyword value to 1 to force protocol SSH-1.  Unfortunately, Tectia’s SSH-1 compatibility mode is scarcely sup- ported by other SSH implementations. Only OpenSSH versions earlier than 3.7 understand the –V option. An alternative is to use the latest implementation of SSH1—the original SSH product—which is still available from ftp:  ftp.ssh.com pub ssh , but it is ancient and no longer actively maintained.  224    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Most other command-line options are passed on from sshd2 to sshd1 without modifi- cation. Specifically, the Tectia server leaves the following options untouched: –b, –g, –h, –k, –p, –q, and –i. The –d option [5.9] is passed to sshd1, but the debug level argument is removed, since it is Tectia-specific. Similarly, the argument for the –f option is unsuitable for sshd1, since it specifies an alternate configuration file, and the syntax for sshd2 and sshd1 configuration files isn’t compatible. Therefore, if an sshd2 -f option is specified, then Tectia uses the Sshd1ConfigFile keyword to modify the argument for the –f option that is used for the sshd1 invocation:   Tectia Sshd1ConfigFile  usr local etc sshd1_config  The Sshd1ConfigFile is only used if sshd2 was invoked with an explicit –f command- line option. Otherwise, no –f option is passed on the sshd1, and sshd1 uses its own default configuration file, just like sshd2.  All other sshd2 options are removed from the command line that is passed to sshd1.  Other command-line options besides –f can cause compatibility prob- lems when they are passed on from sshd2 to sshd1. Some sshd2 options are not supported by all sshd1 implementations, and  even worse  some options with the same names have different interpreta- tions. Be sure to carefully compare the sshd2 and sshd1 documenta- tion for any options that are used. It is usually best to use keywords in different configuration files for sshd2 and sshd1 instead of command- line options in SSH-1 compatibility mode.  If SSH-1 compatibility mode is used, only the Tectia server should be started at boot time. sshd1 is then launched by sshd2 only when needed for SSH-1 connections.  5.10.1  Security Issues with Tectia’s   SSH-1 Compatibility Mode  There’s one vital thing to keep in mind if you’re using the SSH-1 compatibility fea- ture in Tectia: you must maintain two separate SSH server configurations. When sshd2 starts sshd1, it is an entirely new process, with its own SSH-1 server configura- tion file. No restrictions set in your sshd2 server configuration apply to it. Even restrictions that could apply, such as AllowHosts, don’t, because sshd2 invokes sshd1 before performing such checks.  This means you must keep the two configurations synchronized with respect to your security intent. Otherwise, an attacker can circumvent your carefully crafted sshd2 configuration simply by connecting with an SSH-1 client.  A good strategy for automating the synchronization of sshd2 and sshd1 configura- tions is to derive the configuration files from a common template file, using a general-purpose macro preprocessor like m4. The following list describes the basic idea.  5.10 Compatibility Between SSH-1 and SSH-2 Servers    225  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   1. Invent symbols like TECTIA and OPENSSH to label the implementations for the  sshd2 and sshd1 configurations.  2. Construct the template file using m4 preprocessor conditionals like ifdef to han-  dle incompatibilities between sshd2 and sshd1, such as syntax differences:  ifdef TECTIA, 'DenyGroups bad.*, worse'  ifdef OPENSSH,'DenyGroups bad* worse'   The template file helps to maintain the configurations because similar con- structs are kept together, and duplicate information is minimized. Any common keywords and values can be specified in the template file without conditionals.  3. Generate the sshd2 and sshd1 configurations from the template by defining the appropriate implementation symbols on the command line using the m4 preprocessor:  m4 -DTECTIA sshd_config_template > sshd2_config m4 -DOPENSSH sshd_config_template > sshd1_config  4. For even more automation, set up a Makefile containing targets for the sshd2 and  sshd1 configuration files, with m4 preprocessor commands for each:  all: sshd2_config sshd1_config sshd2_config: sshd_config_template  m4 -DTECTIA $  $@  sshd1_config: sshd_config_template  m4 -DOPENSSH $  $@  5. To ensure that the real sshd2 and sshd1 configuration files are up to date when- ever the template file changes, regenerating the configuration files if necessary, simply use the command make. This can be done at boot time before the Tectia server is started, or subsequently when the configuration file is reread using SIGHUP. [5.2.4]  5.11 Summary As you can see, SSH servers have a tremendous number of configuration options, and in some cases, multiple ways to achieve the same results. All this power comes at a price, however. When setting up a secure system, it is vital to consider each option carefully and select appropriate values. Don’t skimp on understanding: the security of your systems may depend on it. Chapter 10 lists configurations for OpenSSH and Tectia. the keywords and options in this chapter appear in Appendix E.  In addition, all  Remember that serverwide configuration is only one avenue for affecting server behavior. We discuss compile-time configuration in Chapter 4 and per-account con- figuration in Chapter 8.  226    Chapter 5: Serverwide Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

We’ve encountered several programs related to keys:  ssh-keygen  ssh-agent  Creates key pairs  Holds private keys in memory, saving you from typing your passphrase repeat- edly ssh-add  Loads private keys into the agent  However, we haven’t gone into much depth, covering only the most basic opera- tions with keys. Now it’s time to examine these concepts and programs in detail.  We begin with an overview of SSH identities and the keys that represent them. After that, we thoroughly cover SSH agents and their many features. Finally, we extol the virtues of having multiple SSH identities. If you’ve been getting by with a single key and only light agent use, we have a lot of cool stuff in store for you. Figure 6-1 sum- marizes the role of key management in the overall configuration process.  This chapter is the first in a sequence on advanced SSH for end users, as opposed to system administrators. Once you’ve covered key management in this chapter, we’ll take you through client configuration, server configuration, and forwarding in Chap- ters 7–9.  6.1 What Is an Identity? An SSH identity is a sequence of bits that says, “I am really me.” It is a mathematical construct that permits an SSH client to prove itself to an SSH server, so the SSH server says, “Ah, I see, it’s really you. You are hereby authenticated. Come in.”  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

SSH user key and agent configuration  highlighted parts   An identity consists of two parts, called the private key and the public key. Together, they are known as a key pair.  The private key represents your identity for outgoing SSH connections. When you run an SSH client in your account, such as ssh or scp, and it requests a connection with an SSH server, the client uses this private key to prove your identity to the server.  Private keys must be kept secret. An intruder with your private key can access your account as easily as you can.  The public key represents your identity for incoming connections to your account. When an SSH client requests access to your account, using a private key as proof of identity, the SSH server examines the corresponding public key. If the keys “match”  according to a cryptographic test , authentication succeeds and the connection pro- ceeds. Public keys don’t need to be secret; they can’t be used to break into an account.  228    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   A key pair is typically stored in a pair of files with related names. In SSH, the public- key filename is the same as the private one, but with the suffix .pub added. For exam- ple, if the file mykey holds a private key, its corresponding public key is found in mykey.pub.  You may have as many SSH identities as you like. Most SSH implementations let you specify a default identity clients use unless told otherwise. To use an alternative iden- tity, you must change a setting by command-line argument, configuration file, or some other configuration tool.  The structure of identity files differs for OpenSSH and Tectia, so we explain them separately. Their locations in the filesystem are shown in Figures 6-2  private keys  and 6-3  public keys .  $HOME  .ssh  .ssh2  identity  id_dsa  identification  private key  private key  SSH-1  SSH-2  OpenSSH  IDkey one  IDkey two  ...

By default, the private key is stored in the file id_dsa, and the public key in id_dsa.pub.* This key pair, which is kept in your ~ .ssh directory, is your default identity that clients use unless told otherwise. The private key looks something like this:  -----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY----- Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED DEK-Info: DES-EDE3-CBC,89C3AE51BC5876FD  Or “BEGIN RSA” for RSA keys  MXZJgnkYE+1+eff3yt9j aCCABz75egbGJfAbWrseiu0k3Dim9Teu2Ob1Xjdv4U9 II1hVYOkgQYuhdJbzrLMpJ0W1+N5ujI8akJ6j0ESeGTwJbhGyst71Y3A2+w4m1iv  * If your default key is an RSA key, the filenames are id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.

Before it can be used for authentication, this public key must be copied into an authorization file on an SSH server machine, ~ .ssh authorized_keys. Thereafter, when an SSH client requests a connection to your server account using a private key as proof of identity, the OpenSSH server consults your authorized_keys file to find the matching public key.  Tectia Identities  6.1.2 A Tectia key pair is also stored in two files with related names  i.e., the private-key filename plus .pub yields the public-key filename . Tectia key files are often named based on the key’s cryptographic properties. For example, a 2048-bit, DSA- encrypted key is generated by default in the Tectia files id_dsa_2048_a and id_dsa_ 2048_a.pub. These files are in a format known as “SECSH public-key file format” and sometimes “SSH2 format.” The encrypted private key looks like this:  ---- BEGIN SSH2 ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY ---- Subject: smith Comment: "2048-bit dsa, smith@example.com, Sat Feb 12 2005 15:17:53 -0200"  230    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Converting SSH-1 Keys to SSH-2 with ssh-keyconverter  OpenSSH includes the program ssh-keyconverter, which converts old SSH-1 RSA keys into a format suitable for SSH-2 authentication. If you used SSH-1 in the early days but are just getting around to upgrading, ssh-keyconverter might save you the time of gen- erating and installing new keys. There are two uses: Converting key files  Run ssh-keyconverter with the –k option to convert a single SSH-1 RSA key file to SSH-2 format. If your private key file is mykey, run:  $ ssh-keyconverter -k -o newfile mykey Creates newfile and newfile.pub  Converting your entire authorized_keys file  Run ssh-keyconverter with the –a option to convert all SSH-1 RSA keys in your authorized_keys file to SSH-2 format:  $ cd ~ .ssh $ ssh-keyconverter -a -o newfile authorized_keys ...Check that file newfile looks correct, and then... $ mv newfile authorized_keys $ chmod 600 authorized_keys  Existing SSH-2 format keys are ignored. See the manpage for ssh-keyconverter for more details.

When a Tectia client tries to authenticate, it may use all keys in the collection. If the first key fails to authenticate, the Tectia client automatically tries the second, and so forth, until it succeeds or fails completely.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.1 What Is an Identity?    231   To create an identity in Tectia, private keys must be listed in a file called an identifi- cation file. Your default identity file is ~ .ssh2 identification.* Inside the file, private keys are listed one per line. For public-key authentication, a line begins with the key- word IdKey, followed by the name of the private-key file:   Tectia identification file  The following names are relative to ~ .ssh2 IdKey id_dsa_2048_a IdKey my-other-tectia-key  This key uses an absolute path IdKey  usr local etc third-key  The identification file may also contain PGP-related keywords: [6.5]  Like OpenSSH, Tectia has an authorization file for incoming connections, but with a difference. Instead of containing copies of the public keys, the Tectia authorization file merely lists the public-key filenames using the Key keyword:   Tectia identification file PgpSecretKeyFile my-file.pgp IdPgpKeyName my-key-name   Tectia authorization file Key id_dsa_2048_a.pub Key something-else.pub  Notice you have only one copy of each public key. This is slightly easier to maintain than OpenSSH’s system, which has separate copies in the .pub file and authorized_ keys file. [8.2.1]  Tectia’s identification file can group multiple keys as a single identity. You can approximate this behavior in OpenSSH with the IdentityFile keyword. [7.4.2] To set up a default “identity” with multiple keys, add the following section to the end of your ~ .ssh config file:  Host *  IdentityFile key1  IdentityFile key2  IdentityFile key3  Now this multiple-key “identity” is available for all SSH connections. Similarly, you can place multiple IdentityFile values in any other sec- tion of the configuration file to associate a multikey identity with a particular host or set of hosts.  * This default may be changed with the IdentityFile keyword. [7.4.2]  232    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Creating an Identity  6.2 Most SSH implementations include a program for creating key pairs. We cover ssh- keygen from OpenSSH and Tectia.  Generating Keys for OpenSSH  6.2.1 OpenSSH uses the program ssh-keygen to create key pairs. [2.4.2] Let’s go into more detail about this program for creating new keys or modifying existing keys.  Creating OpenSSH keys  6.2.1.1 When creating a new key, you must indicate the key type  DSA or RSA  using the –t flag:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa  You may also specify these options for creating keys:    The number of bits in the key, using –b; the default is 1024 bits:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 2048    The name of the private-key file to be generated, using –f. The name is relative to your current directory. Recall that the public-key file is named after the private one with .pub appended.  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -f mykey  Creates mykey and mykey.pub  If you omit the –f option, you are prompted for the information:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa ... Enter file in which to save the key   home barrett .ssh id_dsa : mykey  The default filename for DSA keys is ~ .ssh id_dsa, and for RSA keys it’s ~ .ssh  id_rsa.    The passphrase to decode the key, using –N:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -N secretword  If you omit this option, you’ll be prompted for the information:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa ... Enter passphrase: [nothing is echoed] Enter the same passphrase again: [nothing is echoed]    A textual comment associated with the key, using –C. If you omit this option, the comment is username@host, where username is your username and host is the local hostname:  $ ssh-keygen ... -C "my favorite key"  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.2 Creating an Identity    233   Before using any option that places your passphrase on the shell com- mand line, such as the –N or –P options of ssh-keygen, carefully con- sider the security implications. Because the passphrase appears on your screen, it may be visible to onlookers, and while running, it may be visible to other users viewing the machine’s process list via the ps command. In addition, if your shell creates history files of the com- mands you type, the passphrase is inserted into a history file where it can be read by a third party. Also, if you think you have a good reason just to type Return and give your key no passphrase, think again. That is essentially equivalent to putting your password in a file in your home directory named MY- PASSWORD.PLEASE-STEAL-ME. If you don’t want to have to type a passphrase, the right thing to do is to use ssh-agent, hostbased authen- tication, or Kerberos. There are very limited circumstances having to do with unattended usage  e.g., cron jobs  where a plaintext, pass- phrase-less client key might be acceptable. [11.1]  If you use both –f  specify output file  and –N  specify passphrase , ssh-keygen issues no prompts. Therefore, you can automate key generation using these options  and perhaps redirecting output to  dev null :  $ ssh-keygen -f mykey -N secretword  You might use this technique to automate generation of a large number of keys for some purpose. Use it carefully, though, and always on a secure machine. The pass- word on the command line is probably visible to other users on the same machine via ps or similar programs; and if you’re scripting with this technique, obviously the passphrases shouldn’t be kept in files for long.  6.2.1.2 Working with OpenSSH keys In addition to creating keys, ssh-keygen can manipulate existing keys in the follow- ing ways:    Changing the passphrase of an existing key, using –p. You can specify the file-  name with –f and the old and new passphrases with –P and –N, respectively:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -p -f mykey -P secretword -N newword Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.  But if you omit them, you are prompted:  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa -p Enter file in which the key is   home barrett .ssh id_rsa : mykey Enter old passphrase: [nothing is echoed] Key has comment 'my favorite key' Enter new passphrase  empty for no passphrase : [nothing is echoed] Enter the same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.  Note that this changes the passphrase but doesn’t change the key, it just re- encrypts the key with the new passphrase. So, the corresponding public-key file on remote machines doesn’t change or need to be replaced.  234    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Printing the fingerprint of a given key file, with –l. See the sidebar “Key Finger- prints” for more information. The fingerprint can be calculated from the public key:  $ ssh-keygen -l -f stevekey.pub 1024 5c:f6:e2:15:39:14:1a:8b:4c:93:44:57:6b:c6:f4:17 steve@snailbook.com $ ssh-keygen -B -f stevekey.pub 1024 xitot-larit-gumet-fyfim-sozev-vyned-cigeb-sariv-tekuk-badus-bexax Steve@snailbook.com    Printing a DNS resource record with –r, and using DNS resource record format with –g. These options produce key fingerprints in a format suitable for a BIND nameserver, for the purposes of verifying SSH host keys via the DNS. [7.4.3.2]    Converting between SECSH  Tectia  and OpenSSH key-storage formats, with –e,  –i, and –y.  Option -e -i -y  Extract convert from... OpenSSH private-key file  “export”  SECSH public-key file  “import”  OpenSSH private-key file  To... SECSH public key  Tectia format  OpenSSH public key OpenSSH public key  An OpenSSH “private” key file actually contains both the public and private keys of a pair, so the –e and –y options simply extract the public key and print it out in the desired format. Use –e to convert an OpenSSH public key for your ~ .ssh2  authorization file on a Tectia server host, and –i to do the opposite. The –y option is useful if you accidentally delete your OpenSSH public-key file and need to restore it. Tectia keys are in a format called SECSH Public Key File Format or SSH2 format, also used by other SSH implementations whose keys you may import and export. A function that’s missing is converting the private keys as well. This is useful if you have an OpenSSH server host on which you also want to run Tectia, and you want the two SSH servers to share a host key.  When you make changes to a key, such as its passphrase or comment, the changes are applied to the key file only. If you have keys loaded in an SSH agent, the copies in the agent don’t get changed. For instance, if you list the keys in the agent with ssh-add -l  lowercase L  after changing the comment, you still see the old comment in the agent. To make the changes take effect in the agent, unload and reload the affected keys.  Generating Keys for Tectia  6.2.2 Tectia also uses a program named ssh-keygen to create key pairs and manipulate existing keys.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.2 Creating an Identity    235   Key Fingerprints  Fingerprints are a common cryptographic feature for checking that two keys in differ- ent places are the same, when comparing them literally—bit by bit—is infeasible. OpenSSH and Tectia can compute fingerprints. Suppose Steve wants SSH access to Judy’s account. He sends his public key to Judy by email, and she installs it in her SSH authorization file. While this key exchange seems straightforward, it is insecure: a hostile third party could intercept Steve’s key and sub- stitute his own, gaining access to Judy’s account. To prevent this risk, Judy needs some way to verify that the key she receives is Steve’s. She can call Steve on the telephone and check, but reading a 500-byte encrypted public key over the phone is annoying and error-prone. This is why fingerprints exist. A fingerprint is a short value computed from a key. It’s analogous to a checksum, ver- ifying that a string of data is unaltered—in our case, a key. To check the validity of a key using fingerprints, Steve and Judy could do the following:  1. Judy receives a public key that is supposed to be Steve’s, storing it in the file  stevekey.pub.  2. Separately, Judy and Steve view the fingerprint of the key:   OpenSSH $ ssh-keygen -l -f stevekey.pub 1024 5c:f6:e2:15:39:14:1a:8b:4c:93:44:57:6b:c6:f4:17 Steve@snailbook.com $ ssh-keygen -B -f stevekey.pub 1024 xitot-larit-gumet-fyfim-sozev-vyned-cigeb-sariv-tekuk-badus-bexax Steve@snailbook.com   Tectia $ ssh-keygen -F stevekey.pub Fingerprint for key: xitot-larit-gumet-fyfim-sozev-vyned-cigeb-sariv-tekuk-badus-bexax  3. Judy calls Steve on the telephone and asks him to read the fingerprint over the phone. Judy verifies that it matches the fingerprint of the key she received. Fin- gerprints are not unique, but for any two keys, the probability that their finger- prints are identical is extremely small. Therefore, fingerprints are a quick and convenient method for checking that a key is unaltered.  As you can see, OpenSSH and Tectia use different output formats for fingerprints. OpenSSH supports both a numeric format which is more traditional and should be familiar to users of PGP, and a textual format called “Bubble Babble” which is claimed to be easier to read and remember. Tectia supports only Bubble Babble fingerprints. Fingerprints also surface when you connect to an SSH server whose host key has changed. In this case, OpenSSH prints a warning message and the fingerprint of the new key, which may be conveniently compared with the fingerprint of the real host key, should you have it.  236    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Creating Tectia keys  6.2.2.1 When creating a new key, you may choose the name of the private-key file to be gen- erated, by specifying the name at the end of the command line:  $ ssh-keygen mykey  creates mykey and mykey.pub  The name is relative to your current directory, and as usual, the public key file is named after the private one with .pub appended. The key is saved in the directory ~ .ssh2 in a file whose name indicates the key type and number of bits. An exam- ple is id_dsa_2048_a, which was generated by the DSA algorithm with 2048 bits.  You also may indicate the following with command-line options:    The number of bits in the key, using –b; the default is 2048 bits:    The key type, such as DSA or RSA, using –t:  $ ssh-keygen -b 4096  $ ssh-keygen -t dsa    A textual comment associated with the key, using –c:  $ ssh-keygen -c "my favorite Tectia key"  If you omit this option, the generated comment describes how and by whom the key was generated. For example:  "2048-bit dsa, barrett@server.example.com, Tue Feb 22 2000 02:03:36"    The passphrase to decode the key, using –p. If you omit this option, you are  prompted after generation.  $ ssh-keygen -p secretword  You can also designate an empty password using –P. This shouldn’t be done in general but is appropriate in some special cases: [11.1.2.2]    Whether or not to overwrite the key file, if it already exists, with --overwrite  $ ssh-keygen -P  and the value yes  the default  or no:  $ ssh-keygen --overwrite no mykeyfile  6.2.2.2 Working with Tectia keys In addition to creating keys, ssh-keygen can operate on keys in the following ways:    By changing the passphrase and comment of an existing key, using –e. This option causes ssh-keygen to become interactive, prompting for the new informa- tion. This interactive mode is primitive and annoying, requiring nearly 10 user responses to change the passphrase and comment, but it does the job:  $ ssh-keygen -e mykey Passphrase needed for key "my favorite Tectia key" Passphrase : [nothing is echoed] Do you want to edit key "my favorite Tectia key"  yes or no ? yes Your key comment is "my favorite Tectia key".  Do you want to edit it  yes or no ? yes  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.2 Creating an Identity    237   New key comment: this is tedious Do you want to edit passphrase  yes or no ? yes New passphrase : [nothing is echoed] Again          : [nothing is echoed] Do you want to continue editing key "this is tedious"  yes or no ? god no  yes or no ? no Do you want to save key "this is tedious" to file mykey  yes or no ? yes  Changes are applied to the key files but not propagated to any copies currently loaded in an agent.  So, if you run ssh-add -l to list the keys in your agent, for example, you still see the old comment.

Finally, ssh-keygen has one guru-level advanced option, –r, for affecting the random numbers used for key generation. It causes ssh-keygen to modify ~ .ssh2 random_seed using data you enter on standard input. [3.6.4] The Tectia manpages call this “stir- ring data into the random pool.” Note that the program doesn’t prompt you to enter data, it just sits there looking like it’s hung. When this occurs, type as much data as you like and press the EOF character  Control-D in most shells :  $ ssh-keygen -r I am stirring the random pool. blah blah blah ^D Stirred in 46 bytes.

If you forget a passphrase, you are out of luck: the corresponding SSH private key becomes unusable because you can’t decrypt it. The same encryption that makes SSH so secure also makes passphrases impossible to recover. You have to abandon your SSH key, generate a new one, and choose a new passphrase for it. You must also install the new public key on every machine that holds the original one.  Smartcard Support in OpenSSH  OpenSSH includes experimental support for hardware devices  smartcards  that can hold private user keys. This includes: ssh-keygen  The –D  download  and –U  upload  options  ssh-add  ssh  The –s  add key  and –e  remove key  options  The –I option and the SmartCardDevice configuration keyword, to choose a smart- card device  At press time, smartcard support in OpenSSH is still experimental, so we don’t cover it. We mention it only for completeness.  6.2.4  Generating New Groups for Difﬁe-Hellman    Key   Exchange  As we saw in Chapter 3, the SSH Transport Protocol uses the Diffie-Hellman key- agreement algorithm to generate cryptographic session keys for the SSH connection. [3.8.1.3] One parameter to this algorithm is a mathematical structure from algebra known as a “group”; specifically, a finite integer group with respect to multiplica- tion modulo a prime. In the initial SSH protocol, a single fixed group was used for the key exchange. Due to concern over possible future attacks against this fixed parameter, an extension was created to allow the group to be negotiated, and this extension is now widely implemented.  The OpenSSH server selects the groups to be offered the client from the file  etc  moduli. OpenSSH comes with a moduli file defining a set of suitable groups, and for most people this is sufficient; there is no pressing need to regenerate them. On par- ticularly slow systems, you might edit this file to select groups with a smaller prime modulus, to speed up the key exchange.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.2 Creating an Identity    241   If you like, you can generate your own set of key-exchange groups using ssh-keygen -G. This usage is quite technical and infrequently used, so we won’t delve further into it here; refer to the ssh-keygen manpage, in the section “MODULI GENERATION,” for details. You can also see an example in OpenBSD’s usr src etc Makefile for OpenSSH, e.g.:  http:  www.openbsd.org cgi-bin cvsweb src etc Makefile? rev=1.215&content-type=text x-cvsweb-markup  SSH Agents  6.3 An SSH agent is a program that caches private keys and responds to authentication- related queries from SSH clients. [2.5] They are terrific labor-saving devices, han- dling all key-related operations and eliminating the need to retype your passphrase.  The programs related to agents are ssh-agent and ssh-add. ssh-agent runs an agent, and ssh-add inserts and removes keys from the agent’s key cache. A typical use might look like this:   Start the agent $ ssh-agent $SHELL  Load your default identity $ ssh-add Need passphrase for  home barrett .ssh identity  barrett@example.com . Enter passphrase: ********  By typing your passphrase a single time, you decrypt the private key which is then stored in memory by the agent. From now on, until you terminate the agent or log out, SSH clients automatically contact the agent for all key-related operations. You needn’t type your passphrase again.  We now briefly discuss how agents work. After that we get practical and illustrate different ways to start an agent, various configuration options, and several tech- niques for automatically loading your keys into the agent. Finally, we cover agent security and agent forwarding.  Agents Do Not Expose Keys  6.3.1 Agents perform two tasks:    Store your private keys in memory   Answer questions  from SSH clients  about those keys  Agents don’t, however, send your private keys anywhere. This is important to under- stand. Once loaded, private keys remain within an agent, unseen by SSH clients. To access a key, a client says, “Hey agent! I need your help. Please perform a key-related operation for me.” The agent obeys and sends the results to the client, as in Figure 6-4.  242    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   SSH Client run by Bob  request for a key related computation  result  1  2  Agent for user bob  bobs private keys, unencrypted  Figure 6-4. How an SSH agent works with its clients  For example, if ssh needs to sign an authenticator, it sends the agent a signing request containing the authenticator data and an indication of which key to use. The agent performs the cryptographic operation itself and returns the signature.  In this manner, SSH clients use the agent without seeing its private keys. This tech- nique is more secure than handing out keys to clients. The fewer places that private keys get stored or sent, the harder it is to steal them.*  Starting an Agent  6.3.2 There are two ways to invoke an agent in your login account:    The single-shell method that uses your current login shell   The subshell method that forks a subshell to facilitate the inheritance of some  environment variables  Don’t invoke an agent with the “obvious” but wrong command:  $ ssh-agent  Although the agent runs without complaint, SSH clients can’t contact it, and the termination command  ssh-agent -k  doesn’t kill it, because some environment variables aren’t properly set.  Single-shell method  6.3.2.1 The single-shell method runs an agent in your current login shell. This is most conve- nient if you’re running a login shell on a single terminal, as opposed to a Unix Win- dow system such as X. Type:  $ eval `ssh-agent`  * This design also fits well with token-based key storage, in which your keys are kept on a smart card carried with you. Like agents, smart cards respond to key-related requests but don’t give out keys, so integration with SSH would be straightforward. Though adoption of tokens has been slow, we believe it will be com- monplace in the future.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    243   and an ssh-agent process is forked in the background. The process detaches itself from your terminal, returning a prompt to you, so you needn’t run it in the back- ground manually  i.e., with an ampersand on the end . Note that the quotes around ssh-agent are backquotes, not apostrophes.  What purpose does eval serve? Well, when ssh-agent runs, it not only forks itself in the background, but it also outputs some shell commands to set several environ- ment variables necessary for using the agent. The variables are SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID for OpenSSH, or SSH2_AUTH_SOCK and SSH2_AGENT_PID for Tectia. The eval command causes the current shell to interpret the commands output by ssh- agent, setting the environment variables. If you omit the eval, the following com- mands are printed on standard output as ssh-agent is invoked. For example:   OpenSSH $ ssh-agent SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh-22841-agent; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=22842; export SSH_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 22842;   Tectia SSH2_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh2-22842-agent; export SSH2_AUTH_SOCK; SSH2_AGENT_PID=22842; export SSH2_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 22842;  Now you’ve got an agent running, but inaccessible to the shell. You can either kill it using the pid printed in the previous output:  $ kill 22842  or point your shell manually to the agent by setting the environment variables exactly as given:*   OpenSSH $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh-22841-agent; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK $ SSH_AGENT_PID=22842; export SSH_AGENT_PID   Tectia $ SSH2_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh2-22842-agent; export SSH2_AUTH_SOCK $ SSH2_AGENT_PID=22842; export SSH2_AGENT_PID  Nevertheless, it’s easier to use eval, so everything is set up for you.†  To terminate the agent, kill its pid:  $ kill 22842  and unset the environment variables:   OpenSSH $ unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK  * This is Bourne shell syntax. If your shell is csh or tcsh, use the appropriate syntax. [6.3.2.3] † Why can’t ssh-agent set its environment variables without all this trickery? Because under Unix, a program  can’t set environment variables in its parent shell.  244    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   $ unset SSH_AGENT_PID   Tectia $ unset SSH2_AUTH_SOCK $ unset SSH2_AGENT_PID   OpenSSH $ eval `ssh-agent -k`  Or for OpenSSH, use the more convenient –k command-line option:  This prints termination commands on standard output so that eval can invoke them. If you forget eval, the agent is still killed, but your environment variables don’t get unset automatically:   OpenSSH $ ssh-agent -k unset SSH_AUTH_SOCK; unset SSH_AGENT_PID echo Agent pid 22848 killed  but the agent gets killed.    This won't get unset,   and neither will this,  Running an agent in a single shell, as opposed to the method we cover next  spawn- ing a subshell , has one problem. When your login session ends, the ssh-agent pro- cess doesn’t die. After several logins, you see many agents running, serving no purpose:*  $ ps uax  grep ssh-agent barrett   7833  0.4  0.4  828  608 pts 1    S 21:06:10  0:00 grep agent barrett   4189  0.0  0.6 1460  844 ?        S   Feb 21  0:06 ssh-agent barrett   6134  0.0  0.6 1448  828 ?        S 23:11:41  0:00 ssh-agent barrett   6167  0.0  0.6 1448  828 ?        S 23:24:19  0:00 ssh-agent barrett   7719  0.0  0.6 1456  840 ?        S 20:42:25  0:02 ssh-agent  You can get around this problem by running ssh-agent -k automatically when you log out. In Bourne-style shells  sh, ksh, bash , this may be done with a trap of Unix sig- nal 0 at the top of ~ .profile:   ~ .profile trap '   test -n "$SSH_AGENT_PID"  && eval `ssh-agent -k` ;   test -n "$SSH2_AGENT_PID" && kill $SSH2_AGENT_PID ' 0  For C shells and for tcsh, terminate the agent in your ~ .logout file:   ~ .logout if   "$SSH_AGENT_PID" != ""   then   eval `ssh-agent -k` endif if   "$SSH2_AGENT_PID" != ""   then   kill $SSH2_AGENT_PID endif  * Actually, you can reconnect to an agent launched in a previous login, by modifying your SSH_AUTH_SOCK vari-  able to point to the old socket.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    245   Once this trap is set, your ssh-agent process is killed automatically when you log out, printing a message like:  Agent pid 8090 killed  Subshell method  6.3.2.2 The second way to invoke an agent spawns a subshell. You provide an argument to ssh-agent, which is a path to a shell or shell script. Examples are:  $ ssh-agent  bin sh $ ssh-agent  bin csh $ ssh-agent $SHELL $ ssh-agent my-shell-script  Run a shell script instead of a shell  This time, instead of forking a background process, ssh-agent runs in the fore- ground, spawning a subshell and setting the aforementioned environment variables automatically. The rest of your login session runs within this subshell, and when you terminate it, ssh-agent terminates as well. This method, as you will see later, is most convenient if you run a Window System such as X and invoke the agent in your ini- tialization file  e.g., ~ .xsession .* However, the method is also perfectly reasonable for single-terminal logins.  When using the subshell method, invoke it at an appropriate time. We recommend the last line of your login initialization file  e.g., ~ .profile or ~ .login  or the first typed command after you log in. Otherwise, if you first run some background pro- cesses in your shell and then invoke the agent, those initial background processes become inaccessible until you terminate the agent’s subshell. For example, if you run the vi editor, suspend it, and then run the agent, you lose access to the editor session until you terminate the agent:  $ vi myfile ^Z $ jobs [1] + Stopped  SIGTSTP  vi $ ssh-agent $SHELL $ jobs $ exit $ jobs [1] + Stopped  SIGTSTP  vi   Run your editor.  Suspend it.  View your background processes.   Run a subshell.  No jobs here! They're in the parent shell.  Terminate the agent’s subshell.  Now we can see our processes again.  The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are shown in Table 6-2.  * In fact, many Linux distributions set this up for you, automatically launching ssh-agent when you log in via KDE or GNOME. Red Hat Linux and SUSE Linux are two examples. After logging in, run a ps command and grep for “agent” to see this in action.  246    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Agent’s environment variables are propagated automatically; terminates on logout. Conve- niently set up by many Linux distributions.  Cons Must be terminated manually. Your login shell becomes dependent on the agent’s health; if the agent dies, your login shell may die.  Format of environment variable commands  6.3.2.3 As we’ve said, ssh-agent prints a sequence of shell commands to set several environ- ment variables. The syntax of these commands differs depending on which shell is being used. You can force the commands to use Bourne-style or C-shell-style syntax with the –s and –c options, respectively:   Bourne-shell style commands $ ssh-agent -s SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh-3654-agent; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=3655; export SSH_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 3655;   C-shell style commands $ ssh-agent -c setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK  tmp ssh-barrett ssh-3654-agent; setenv SSH_AGENT_PID 3655; echo Agent pid 3655;  Normally ssh-agent detects your login shell and prints the appropriate lines, so you don’t need –c or –s. One situation where you need these options is if you invoke ssh- agent within a shell script, but the script’s shell is not the same type as your login shell. For example, if your login shell is  bin csh, and you invoke this script:  ! bin sh `ssh-agent`  ! bin sh `ssh-agent -s`  ssh-agent outputs C-shell-style commands, which fails. So, you should use:  This is particularly important if you run an agent under X, and your ~ .xsession file  or other startup file  is executed by a shell different from your login shell.  Loading Keys with ssh-add  6.3.3 The program ssh-add is your personal communication channel to an ssh-agent pro- cess. When you first invoke an SSH agent, it contains no keys. ssh-add, as you might guess from its name, can add private keys to an SSH agent. But the name is mislead- ing because ssh-add also controls the agent in other ways, such as listing keys, delet- ing keys, and locking the agent from accepting further keys.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    247   If you invoke ssh-add with no arguments, your default SSH keys are loaded into the agent, once you have typed their passphrases.* For example:   Output shown for OpenSSH $ ssh-add Enter passphrase for  home smith .ssh id_dsa: ******** Identity added:  home smith .ssh id_dsa  Normally, ssh-add reads the passphrase from the user’s terminal. If the standard input isn’t a terminal, however, and the DISPLAY environment variable is set, ssh-add instead invokes an X Window graphical program called ssh-askpass or x11-ssh-askpass that pops up a window to read your passphrase. This is especially convenient in xdm startup scripts.†  If you don’t like ssh-askpass, set your environment variable SSH_ ASKPASS to the full path to an alternative program  say,  usr local bin  my-ask-pass . Then this other program, rahter than ssh-askpass, runs automatically to gather your passphrase.  OpenSSH only.   ssh-add supports the following command-line options for listing and deleting keys, and for reading the passphrase:    List all identities loaded in the agent. OpenSSH lists the key fingerprints with –l   see the earlier sidebar “Key Fingerprints” for more detail :   OpenSSH $ ssh-add -l 1024 e9:39:50:f0:b4:65:ba:b9:d7:d3:69:10:d0:23:a7:88 a  DSA  1024 7c:91:07:29:46:a8:61:b4:7c:95:69:fc:47:1e:3c:ff b  RSA  To print the public keys held in the OpenSSH agent, use –L:   OpenSSH $ ssh-add -L ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAACBAK5ArDaZyPXa5Iz... and so forth ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAtIgHblLp1i... and so forth Tectia lists brief information about the loaded keys with –l:   Tectia $ ssh-add -l Listing identities. The authorization agent has two keys: id_dsa_2048_a: my main key id_dsa_2048_b: another key    Delete an identity from the agent, with –d:  $ ssh-add -d ~ .ssh second_id Identity removed:  home smith .ssh second_id  second_id.pub   * OpenSSH’s ssh-add tries to reuse a passphrase to load subsequent keys. † X has its own security problems, of course. If someone can connect to your X server, they can monitor all your keystrokes, including your passphrase. Whether this is an issue in using ssh-askpass depends on your system and security needs.  248    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If you don’t specify a key file, ssh-add deletes your default identity from the agent:  $ ssh-add -d Identity removed:  home smith .ssh id_dsa   home smith .ssh id_dsa.pub     Delete all identities from the agent, with –D; this unloads every currently loaded  key but leaves the agent running:   OpenSSH $ ssh-add -D All identities removed.   Tectia $ ssh-add -D Deleting all identities.    Set a timeout for a key, with –t. Normally when you add a key, it remains loaded in the agent indefinitely, until the agent terminates or you unload the key manu- ally. The –t option assigns a lifetime to a key, measured in seconds  OpenSSH  or minutes  Tectia . After this time has passed, the agent automatically unloads the key:  $ ssh-add -t 30 mykey  OpenSSH has a richer syntax for specifying times that may also be used here; see the sidebar “Time Values in Configuration Files” in Chapter 5:   OpenSSH $ ssh-add -t 3W mykey  Set a key lifetime of three weeks  You can also specify the maximum lifetime for all keys in the agent:   OpenSSH $ eval 'ssh-agent -t 3W'  All keys in the agent have a lifetime of three weeks or less    Lock and unlock the agent with a password, using –x and –X  OpenSSH  or –L and –U  Tectia . A locked agent refuses all ssh-add operations except an unlock request. If you try to modify the state of the agent  adding or deleting keys, etc. , the operation is rejected, and if you try to list the agent’s keys, you are told the agent has no keys. To lock:   OpenSSH $ ssh-add -x Enter lock password: **** Again: **** Agent locked   Tectia $ ssh-add -L Enter lock password: **** Again: **** and to unlock:   OpenSSH ssh-add -X  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    249   Enter lock password: **** Agent unlocked   Tectia $ ssh-add -U Enter lock password: ****  Locking is a convenient way to protect the agent if you step away from your computer but leave yourself logged in. You can instead unload all your keys with ssh-add -D, but then you have to reload them again when you return. If you have only one key there’s no difference, but if you use several it’s a pain. Unfortu- nately, both OpenSSH and Tectia’s locking mechanism aren’t tremendously secure. ssh-agent simply stores the lock password in memory, refusing to honor any more requests until it receives an unlock message containing the same pass- word. The locked agent is still vulnerable to attack: if an intruder gains access to your account  or the root account , he can dump the agent’s process address space and extract your keys. The lock feature certainly deters casual misuse, but the potential for an attack is real. If you’re seriously concerned about key disclo- sure, think twice before relying on locking. We prefer to see this feature imple- mented by encrypting all the agent’s loaded keys with the lock password. This gives the same user convenience and provides better protection.  OpenSSH’s ssh-add program can also be forced to confirm identities via ssh-askpass before using them, with –c. [6.3.3]  Tectia’s ssh-add program has additional options:  features controlled by command-line    Place limits on agent forwarding with –f and –F.  Agent forwarding, which we’ll cover soon, transmits agent requests between hosts.  The –f option lets you limit, for a given key, the distance that requests for this key may traverse. If a request is made from too far away, measured in hops from machine to machine, the request fails. A hop count of zero disables forwarding for this key alone.   Tectia $ ssh-add -f 0 mykey $ ssh-add -f 3 mykey  Load a key that may be used only locally Load a key and accept requests from up to three hops  away  The –F option lets you limit the set of hosts that may make requests relating to this key. It takes as an argument a set of hostnames, domains, and IP addresses that may make or forward requests. The argument is a comma-separated list of wildcard patterns, as for the serverwide configuration keywords AllowHosts and DenyHosts. [5.5.3]   Tectia $ ssh-add -F '*.example.com' mykey Permit forwarding only in the example.com domain $ ssh-add -F 'server.example.com,*.harvard.edu' mykey Permit forwarding from server       example.com and the harvard.edu domain $ ssh-add -F 'server.example.com,*.harvard.edu' -f 2 mykey Same as the preceding      command, but limit forwarding to two hops  250    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

So, if you had a program passphraser that produces the pass- phrase, you could feed the passphrase to ssh-add:   Tectia $ passphraser  ssh-add    Read keys from a URL rather than a file, with –u:   Tectia $ ssh-add -u http:  server.example.com mykey    Prohibit keys from being used for SSH-1 protocol connections, with -1:   Tectia $ ssh-add -1 my-ssh2-only-key    Perform PGP key operations. Tectia’s ssh-add2 manpage documents the options –R, –N, –P, and –I for OpenPGP keyring operations, but they aren’t officially supported.

Automatic agent loading  single-shell method   6.3.3.1 It’s a pain to invoke ssh-agent and or ssh-add manually each time you log in. With some clever lines in your login initialization file, you can automatically invoke an agent and load your default identity. We’ll demonstrate this with both methods of agent invocation, single-shell and subshell.  With the single-shell method, here are the major steps:  1. Make sure you’re not already running an agent, by testing the environment vari-  able SSH_AUTH_SOCK or SSH2_AUTH_SOCK.  2. Run ssh-agent using eval. 3. If your shell is attached to a tty, load your default identity with ssh-add.  For the Bourne shell and its derivatives  ksh, bash , the following lines can be placed into ~ .profile:   Make sure ssh-agent dies on logout trap '   test -n "$SSH_AGENT_PID"  && eval `ssh-agent -k` ;   test -n "$SSH2_AGENT_PID" && kill $SSH2_AGENT_PID ' 0   If no agent is running and we have a terminal, run ssh-agent and ssh-add.   For Tectia, change this to use SSH2_AUTH_SOCK.  if [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" = "" ] then  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    251   For the C shell and tcsh, the following lines can be placed into ~ .login:    eval `ssh-agent`    usr bin tty >  dev null && ssh-add fi   Use SSH2_AUTH_SOCK instead for Tectia if   ! $?SSH_AUTH_SOCK    then   eval `ssh-agent`    usr bin tty >  dev null && ssh-add endif  and termination code in ~ .logout:   ~ .logout if   "$SSH_AGENT_PID" != ""   eval `ssh-agent -k` if   "$SSH2_AGENT_PID" != ""   kill $SSH2_AGENT_PID  Another single-shell technique to make your clients aware of the agent is to use OpenSSH’s ssh-agent -a option.  This does not work with Tectia’s agent.  With this approach, you choose your own socket in advance—say, ~ .ssh mysocket—and make decisions based on its existence. For example, in your ~ .profile you could have:  ! bin bash SOCKETFILE=~ .ssh mysocket if [ ! -S "$SOCKETFILE" ] then   eval `ssh-agent -a $SOCKETFILE` fi  Since you know the socket path, you can direct SSH clients to it by set- ting SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~ .ssh mysocket as needed. When you termi- nate the OpenSSH agent with ssh-agent -k, the socket file is deleted automatically.  Automatic agent loading  subshell method   6.3.3.2 The second way to load an agent on login uses the subshell method to invoke the agent, and is described in the following list. This time, you add lines to both your login initialization file  ~ .profile or ~ .login , an optional second file of your choice, and your shell initialization file  ~ .cshrc, ~ .bashrc, etc. . This method doesn’t work for the Bourne shell, which has no shell initialization file.  1. In your login initialization file, make sure you’re not already running an agent,  by testing the environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK or SSH2_AUTH_SOCK.  2. As the last line of your login initialization file, exec ssh-agent, which spawns a subshell. Optionally run a second initialization file to configure aspects of the subshell.  3. In your shell initialization file, check whether the shell is attached to a tty and the  agent has no identities loaded yet. If so, load your default identity with ssh-add.  252    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Now let’s see how to do this with Bourne-shell and C-shell families. For derivatives of the Bourne shell  ksh, bash , put the following line at the end of ~ .profile:  test -n "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" && exec ssh-agent $SHELL  This runs the agent, spawning a subshell. If you want to tailor the environment of the subshell, create a script  say, ~ .profile2  to do so, and use this instead:  test -n "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" && exec ssh-agent $SHELL $HOME .profile2  Next, in your shell initialization file  $ENV for ksh, or ~ .bashrc for bash , place the following lines to load your default identity only if it’s not loaded already:   Make sure we are attached to a tty if  usr bin tty >  dev null then    Check the output of "ssh-add -l" for identities.   ssh-add -l  grep 'no identities' >  dev null   if [ $? -eq 0 ]   then      Load your default identity.     ssh-add   fi fi  Automatic agent loading  X Window System   6.3.3.3 If you’re using X and want to run an agent and load your default identity automati- cally, it’s simple. Just use the single-shell method. For example, in your X startup file, usually ~ .xsession, you can use these two lines:  eval `ssh-agent` ssh-add  However, first check if your window environment  e.g., GNOME or KDE  is already running an SSH agent for you, in which case you needn’t do it yourself. This setup is commonly found in Linux distributions.  Agents and Security  6.3.4 As we mentioned earlier, agents don’t expose private keys to SSH clients. Instead, they answer requests from clients using the keys. This approach is more secure than passing keys around, but it still has security concerns. It is important to understand these concerns before completely trusting the agent model:    Agents rely on external access control mechanisms.   Agents can be cracked.  Access control  6.3.4.1 When your agent is loaded with private keys, a potential security issue arises. How does your agent distinguish between legitimate requests from your SSH clients and  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    253   illegitimate requests from unauthorized sources? Since the agent speaks only to other processes on the same host, it uses the host’s existing security mechanisms. These vary from one operating system to another, but the four main mechanisms are:    File permissions   Client identification   Protected memory   Prompt-on-use  File permissions. Under Unix, the agent communicates with users via a named pipe  Unix-domain socket  in the filesystem, so the first line of defense is the file permis- sions on the socket. OpenSSH and Tectia keep agent sockets in a protected direc- tory. OpenSSH’s socket is named  tmp ssh-STRING agent.N, where STRING is random text based on the agent’s process ID, and N is a number:   OpenSSH $ ls -la  tmp ssh-alHMKX4537 drwx------   2 smith    smith       4096 Feb  4 13:40 . drwxrwxrwt   7 root     root        4096 Feb  4 13:40 .. srwxr-xr-x   1 smith    smith       0 Feb  4 13:40 agent.4537  while Tectia’s is named  tmp ssh-USERNAME ssh2-N-agent, where USERNAME is your user- name and N is again a number:   Tectia $ ls -la  tmp ssh-smith  drwx------   2 smith   smith       4096 Feb  4 13:40 . drwxrwxrwt   7 root    root        4096 Feb  4 13:40 .. srw-------   1 smith   smith       0 Feb  4 13:40 ssh2-4537-agent  The number N is usually one less than the process ID  pid  of the agent itself. This is because ssh-agent first creates the socket using its pid, then later starts another pro- cess that actually persists as the agent. In these examples, user smith has a socket for an agent which probably has PID 4536. The containing directory itself has mode 0700.  This organization of a user’s sockets into a single directory is not only for neatness but also for security and portability, because different operating systems treat socket permissions in different ways. For example, Solaris appears to ignore them com- pletely; even a socket with permission 000  no access for anyone  accepts all connec- tions. Linux respects socket permissions, but a write-only socket permits both reading and writing. To deal with such diverse implementations, SSH keeps your sockets in a directory owned by you, with directory permissions that forbid anyone else to access the sockets inside.  Using a subdirectory of  tmp, rather than  tmp itself, also prevents a class of attacks called temp races. A temp-race attack takes advantage of race conditions inherent in the common setting of the “sticky” mode bit on the Unix  tmp directory, allowing  254    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   anyone to create a file there, but only allowing deletion of files owned by the same uid as the deleting process.  If you want to move the socket out of the default  tmp directory, use the –a option: [6.3.3.1]   OpenSSH ssh-agent -a  private ssh mysocket SSH_AUTH_SOCK= private ssh mysocket; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; echo Agent pid 28320;  Client identification. Some flavors of Unix allow one process to find out who’s on the other end of a named pipe: the peer’s process ID, user ID, etc. If this feature is avail- able, an agent can verify that the client’s user ID matches its own.  Protected memory. The ssh-agent process won’t reveal keys via the agent protocol, but those keys are in its memory. A privileged user might be able to attach to the agent process and read the keys from its memory space, bypassing the usual Unix process separation. Some Unixes allow a process to limit or prevent this kind of external interference, so some agents make use of this feature.  Prompt-on-use. Some agents can query the user for permission each time a request comes in over the agent socket  e.g., OpenSSH ssh-add -c . If you use this feature and a window pops up unexpectedly asking about your agent, something’s wrong!  Cracking an agent  6.3.4.2 If the machine running your agent is compromised, an attacker can easily gain access to the IPC channel and thus to your agent. This permits the interloper to make requests of the agent, at least for a time. Once you log out or unload your keys from the agent, the security hole is closed. Therefore, you should run agents only on trusted machines, perhaps unloading your keys  ssh-agent -D  if you’re away from the computer for an extended time, such as overnight.  Since agents don’t give out keys, your keys seem safe from theft if the machine is compromised. Alas, that’s not the case. An enterprising cracker, once logged into the machine, has other means for getting your keys, such as:    Stealing your private-key file and attempting to guess your passphrase   Tracing processes that you’re running, and catching your passphrase while you  type it    Trojan horse attacks: installing modified versions of system programs, such as the login program, shells, or the SSH implementation itself, that steal your pass- phrase    Obtaining a copy of the memory space of your running agent and picking the  keys out of it directly  this is a bit harder than the others   This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    255   The bottom line is this: run agents only on trusted machines. SSH does not excuse you from securing other aspects of your system.  Agent Forwarding  6.3.5 So far, our SSH clients have conversed with an SSH agent on the same machine. Using a feature called agent forwarding, clients can also communicate with agents on remote machines. This is both a convenience feature—permitting your clients on multiple machines to work with a single agent—and a means for avoiding some firewall-related problems.  A ﬁrewall example  6.3.5.1 Suppose you want to connect from your home computer, H, to a computer at work, W. Like many corporate computers, W is behind a network firewall and not directly accessible from the Internet, so you can’t create an SSH connection from H to W. Hmm...what can you do? You call technical support and for once, they have good news. They say that your company maintains a gateway or “bastion” host, B, that is accessible from the Internet and runs an SSH server. This means you should be able to reach W by opening an SSH connection from H to B, and then from B to W, since the firewall permits SSH traffic. Tech support gives you an account on the bastion host B, and the problem seems to be solved...or is it?  For security reasons, the company permits access to its computers only by public-key authentication. So, using your private key on home machine H, you successfully con- nect to bastion host B. And now you run into a roadblock: also for security reasons, the company prohibits users from storing SSH keys on the exposed bastion host B, since they can be stolen if B is hacked. That’s bad news, since the SSH client on B needs a key to connect to your work account on W. Your key is at home on H.  Figure 6-5 illustrates the problem.  What now? Use SSH agent forwarding.  H  B  Internet  sshd  no SSH keys permitted  W  sshd  Corporate Network  Figure 6-5. Bastion host scenario  256    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   SSH agent forwarding allows a program running on a remote host, such as B, to access your ssh-agent on H transparently, as if the agent were running on B. Thus, a remote SSH client running on B can now sign and decrypt data using your key on H, as shown in Figure 6-6. As a result, you can invoke an SSH session from B to your work machine W, solving the problem.  B  ssh  Internet  sshd  proxy agent  Corporate Network  W  ssh  SSH  sshd  H  ssh  ssh-agent user keys  Figure 6-6. Solution with SSH agent forwarding  6.3.5.2 How agent forwarding works Agent forwarding, like all SSH forwarding  Chapter 9 , works “behind the scenes.” In this case, the key-related requests of an SSH client are forwarded across a sepa- rate, previously established SSH session to an agent holding the needed keys, shown in Figure 6-7. Let’s examine in detail the steps that occur.  1. Suppose you’re logged onto machine X, and you invoke ssh to establish a remote  terminal session on machine Y.   On machine X: $ ssh Y  2. Assuming that agent forwarding is turned on, the client says to the SSH server, “I would like to request agent forwarding, please,” when establishing the connec- tion.  3. sshd on machine Y checks its configuration to see if it permits agent forwarding.  Let’s assume that it’s enabled.  4. sshd on machine Y sets up an interprocess communication  IPC  channel local to Y by creating some Unix domain sockets and setting some environment vari- ables. [6.3.2.1] The resulting IPC mechanism is just like the one ssh-agent sets up. As a result, sshd is now prepared to pose as an SSH agent.  5. Your SSH session is now established between X and Y.

Next, from machine Y, you run another ssh command to establish an SSH ses-  Figure 6-7. Agent forwarding  sion with a third machine, Z:   On machine Y: $ ssh Z  7. This new ssh client now needs a key to make the connection to Z. It believes there’s an agent running on machine Y, because sshd on Y is posing as one. So, the client makes an authentication request over the agent IPC channel.  8. sshd intercepts the request, masquerading as an agent, and says, “Hello, I’m the agent. What would you like to do?” The process is transparent: the client believes it’s talking to an agent.  9. sshd then forwards the agent-related request back to the original machine, X, over the secure connection between X and Y. The agent on machine X receives the request and accesses your local key, and its response is forwarded back to sshd on machine Y.  10. sshd on Y passes the response on to the client, and the connection to machine Z  Thanks to agent forwarding, you have transparent access from machine Y to any SSH keys back on machine X. Thus, any SSH clients on Y can access any hosts permitted by your keys on X. To test this, run this command on machine Y to list your keys:  proceeds.   On machine Y: $ ssh-add -l  You see all keys that are loaded in your agent on machine X.  258    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   It’s worth noting that the agent-forwarding relationship is transitive: if you repeat this process, making a chain of SSH connections from machine to machine, then cli- ents on the final host still have access to your keys on the first host  X .  This assumes agent forwarding is permitted by sshd on each intermediate host.   Enabling agent forwarding  6.3.5.3 Before an SSH client can take advantage of agent forwarding, the feature must be turned on. SSH implementations vary in their default settings of this feature, and of course the system administrator can change it. If necessary, you can turn it on manu- ally with the configuration keyword ForwardAgent in the client configuration file ~ .ssh  config, giving a value of yes  the default  or no:*  ForwardAgent yes  Likewise, you can use command-line options. In addition to the –o command-line option, which accepts any configuration keyword and its value:  $ ssh -o "ForwardAgent yes" ...  ssh accepts command-line options to turn on agent forwarding, even though it’s on by default:   OpenSSH $ ssh -A ...   Tectia $ ssh +a ...  $ ssh -a ...  The option –a turns off agent forwarding:  Agent CPU Usage  6.3.6 Before we leave our discussion of agents, we’ll make one final note about perfor- mance. Agents carry out all cryptographic work that is otherwise done by SSH clients. This means an agent can accumulate substantial CPU time. In one case we saw, some friends of ours were using SSH for a great deal of automation, running hundreds of short-lived sessions in a row. Our friends were quite puzzled to find that the single ssh- agent used by all these processes was eating the lion’s share of CPU on that machine!  Debugging the Agent  6.3.7 OpenSSH’s ssh-agent has a primitive debugging mode that’s enabled with the –d option:   OpenSSH ssh-agent -d  * Tectia supports the keyword AllowAgentForwarding as a synonym for ForwardAgent.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.3 SSH Agents    259   SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-nQxHO27500 agent.27500; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; echo Agent pid 27500;  In debug mode, the agent runs in the foreground instead of putting itself into the background  forking . To communicate with the agent and watch it print debug messages, open a second shell  e.g., in a separate X terminal window  and run the variable-setting command that ssh-agent printed on invocation:  $ SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-nQxHO27500 agent.27500; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;  Then try some ssh-add commands and see what the agent does. For example, if you run this in your second shell:  $ ssh-add -l The agent has no identities.  then the agent in the original shell prints:  debug1: type 1 debug1: type 11  The type output indicates the type of message that ssh-agent has received. Types 1 and 11 are requests for identities  SSH-1 and SSH-2, respectively , which makes per- fect sense because that’s what ssh-add -l does. A few other message codes are 17 to load an identity, 18 to delete one, and 19 to delete all identities. You can learn more message types by reading the C header file authfd.h in the OpenSSH source code.  6.4 Multiple Identities Until now, we’ve assumed you have a single SSH identity that uniquely identifies you to an SSH server. You do have a default identity—our earlier ssh-add examples oper- ated on it—but you may create as many other identities as you like.  Why use several identities? After all, with a single SSH identity, you can connect to remote machines with a single passphrase. That’s very simple and convenient. In fact, most people can survive perfectly well with just one identity. Multiple identities have important uses, however:  Additional security  Secure batch processes  If you use different SSH keys for different remote accounts, and one of your keys is cracked, only some of your remote accounts are vulnerable.  Using an SSH key with an empty passphrase, you can create secure, automated processes between interacting computers, such as unattended backups. [11.1.2.2] However, you definitely don’t want your regular logins to use an unencrypted pri- vate key, so you should create a second key for this purpose.  Different account settings  You can configure your remote account to respond differently based on which key is used for connecting. For example, you can make your Unix login session run different startup files depending on which key is used.  260    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Triggering remote programs  Your remote account can be set up to run specific programs when an alternative key is used, via forced commands. [8.2.3]  In order to use multiple identities, you need to know how to switch between them. There are two ways: manually, and automatically with an agent.  Switching Identities Manually  6.4.1 ssh and scp let you switch your identity with the –i command-line option and the IdentityFile configuration keyword. For either of these techniques, you provide the name of your desired private-key file  OpenSSH  or identification file  Tectia . [7.4.2] Table 6-3 displays a summary of the syntax.  Table 6-3. Specifying an alternate identity  Version OpenSSH Tectia  ssh ssh -i key_file ... ssh -i id_file ...  scp scp -i key_file ... scp -i id_file ...  IdentityFile keyword IdentityFile key_file IdentityFile id_file  Switching Identities with an Agent  6.4.2 If you use an SSH agent, identity switching is handled automatically. Simply load all the desired identities into the agent using ssh-add. Thereafter, when you attempt a connection, your SSH client requests and receives a list of all your identities from the agent. The client then tries each identity in turn until one authenticates successfully, or they all fail. Even if you have 10 different identities for 10 different SSH servers, a single agent  containing these keys  provides appropriate key information to your SSH clients for seamless authentication with all 10 servers.  All of this happens transparently with no effort on your part. Well, almost no effort. If you have several identities loaded in the agent, and more than one can apply in a given situation, the agent might pick the wrong one. For example, suppose you have two OpenSSH identities stored in the files id-normal and id-backups. You use id- normal for terminal sessions, and id-backups for invoking a remote backup program on the same server machine  e.g., using a forced command [8.2.3] . Each day when you log in, you load both keys into an agent, using a clever script that locates and loads all key files in a given directory:  ! bin csh cd ~ .ssh my-keys foreach keyfile  *    ssh-add $keyfile end   An example directory  What happens when you invoke an SSH client?  $ ssh server.example.com  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.4 Multiple Identities    261   In this case, the remote backup program gets run, authenticating with the key in file id-backups. You see, the wildcard in your script returns a list of key files in alphabeti- cal order, so id-backups is added before id-normal, as if you’d typed:  $ ssh-add id-backups $ ssh-add id-normal  Therefore, your SSH clients always use the key id-backups when connecting to server.example.com because the agent provides it first in response to a client request. This might not be what you intended. In this case you could specify the right key on the command line using the –i option:  $ ssh -i id-normal server.example.com  or use the IdentityFile configuration keyword in ~ .ssh config. [7.4.2]  Tailoring Sessions Based on Identity  6.4.3 Multiple identities can be extremely useful. In particular, you can configure your remote accounts to respond differently to different identities. This is a three-step process:  1. Generate a new SSH identity, as we have discussed in this chapter. 2. Set up a detailed client configuration that does what you want, using your new  identity. This is the subject of Chapter 7.  3. Set up your account on the SSH server machine to respond to your new identity  in a desired manner. This is covered in detail in Chapter 8.  We strongly encourage you to experiment with this technique. You can do some really powerful and interesting things with SSH this way. If you’re just running sim- ple terminal sessions with SSH, you are missing half the fun.  PGP Authentication in Tectia  6.5 Pretty Good Privacy  PGP  is another security product employing public-key authen- tication. [1.6.2] PGP keys and SSH keys are implemented differently and aren’t inter- changeable, however, Tectia can perform authentication by PGP key, following the OpenPGP standard.* Yes, you can use your favorite PGP key to prove your identity to a Tectia server  as long as the key file is OpenPGP-compatible; some PGP keys, espe- cially those produced by older software versions, aren’t . At press time, this feature is only sketchily documented. Here’s how to make it work.  * According to SSH Communications Security, PGP authentication in Tectia is not officially supported, nor is  any other feature that is enabled by recompiling the source code.  262    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   First, you need Tectia installed on both the client and server machines. Also, both implementations must be compiled with PGP support included, using the compile- time flag --with-pgp. [4.3.5.7]  On the client machine, you need to make your PGP secret key ring and the desired secret key for authentication available to Tectia clients. Here’s how:  1. Copy your PGP secret key ring to your account’s Tectia directory, ~ .ssh2. Sup-  pose it is called secring.pgp.  2. In an identification file, either ~ .ssh2 identification or another of your choice,  indicate the secret key ring with the keyword PgpSecretKeyFile:  3. Identify the PGP key you wish to use for authentication. This may be done with   Tectia PgpSecretKeyFile secring.pgp  any of three keywords:    To identify the key by name, use IdPgpKeyName:   Tectia IdPgpKeyName mykey    To identify the key by its PGP fingerprint, use IdPgpKeyFingerprint:   Tectia IdPgpKeyFingerprint 48 B5 EA 28 80 5E 29 4D 03 33 7D 17 5E 2E CD 20    To identify the key by its key ID, use IdPgpKeyId:   Tectia IdPgpKeyId 0xD914738D  For IdPgpKeyId, the leading 0x is necessary, indicating that the value is in hexadeci- mal. You can give the value in decimal instead, without the leading 0x, but since PGP displays the value in hex already, it’s unlikely you’d want to do this.  On the server machine, you need to make your PGP public-key ring and the desired public key for authentication available to the Tectia server:  1. Copy your public-key ring from the client machine to the server machine.  Note that this is a key ring, not a lone public key.  Place the ring into your ~ .ssh2 directory on the server. Suppose it is called pubring.pgp.  2. In your authorization file, ~ .ssh2 authorization, identify the public-key ring with  the keyword PgpPublicKeyFile:   Tectia PgpPublicKeyFile pubring.pgp  3. Identify the public key by name, fingerprint, or key ID, as in the client’s identifi- cation file. The PgpKeyName, PgpKeyFingerprint, and PgpKeyId, respectively.  The keywords for the identifica- tion file begin with “Id”.   relevant keywords  slightly different:  are   Tectia: use any ONE of these PgpKeyName mykey  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  6.5 PGP Authentication in Tectia    263   PgpKeyFingerprint 48 B5 EA 28 80 5E 29 4D 03 33 7D 17 5E 2E CD 20 PgpKeyId 0xD914738D  You are done! From the client, initiate a Tectia SSH session. Suppose you create an alternative identification file to use PGP authentication, called ~ .ssh2 idpgp, contain- ing your PgpSecretKeyFile and other lines. Use the –i flag to indicate this file, and initiate a connection:   Tectia $ ssh -i idpgp server.example.com  If everything is set up properly, you are prompted for your PGP passphrase:  Passphrase for pgp key "mykey":  Enter your PGP passphrase, and authentication should succeed.  Tectia External Keys  6.6 Tectia clients can use external key providers that distribute keys, somewhat like authentication agents. These are typically part of a more general solution for PKI  Public Key Infrastructure . The ssh -E command-line option identifies the name of the provider, and Tectia currently supports two of them:  entrust  pkcs11  Entrust products, such as the Entrust Authority Security Manager; see http:   www.entrust.com authority.  PKCS11-compliant dynamic libraries.  An initialization string must be sent to the external key provider using the –I option. The format of this string depends on the provider. It typically includes authentica- tion information and identifies the desired key. Sometimes you also need a DLL sup- plied by the provider. Consult the documentation for specific providers, and the ssh- externalkeys manpage, for details about the initialization string.   Tectia $ ENTRUST_INIT="dll libentrust.so " $ ENTRUST_INIT="$ENTRUST_INIT password blartz " $ ENTRUST_INIT="$ENTRUST_INIT ini-file $HOME solo.ini " $ ENTRUST_INIT="$ENTRUST_INIT profile-file $HOME solo_user.epf " $ ENTRUST_INIT="$ENTRUST_INIT login-options entrust "" $ ssh -E entrust -I "$ENTRUST_INIT"  The external key provider and initialization string can also be specified in the client configuration file, using the keywords EkProvider and EkInitString, respectively:   Tectia EkProvider      pkcs11 EkInitString    "lib=libpcks11.so password=blurfl key=laptop"  264    Chapter 6: Key Management and Agents  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The keywords are usually more convenient than the command-line options, espe- cially for long initialization strings, but beware of storing sensitive authentication information in configuration files. Be sure to quote the initialization string if it con- tains characters with special meaning to the shell  e.g., wildcards  or to the configu- ration file itself.  Summary  6.7 In this chapter, we’ve seen how to create and use SSH identities, represented by key pairs, either individually  OpenSSH  or in collections  Tectia . Keys are created by ssh-keygen and are accessed by clients as needed. Tectia provides an additional layer of configuration, the identification file, which lets you use a set of identities as a sin- gle identity. You may have as many identities as you like. Be sure to read our case study on PKI and scalable authentication for another detailed look at identities. [11.5]  SSH agents are useful timesavers to avoid retyping passphrases. Their operation has numerous subtleties, but once you get the hang of it, running an agent should become second nature.

Chapter 2 introduced remote logins and file copying but covered only the tip of the iceberg. You can also connect with multi- ple SSH identities, use a variety of authentication and encryption techniques, exer- cise control over TCP IP settings, and generally tailor the feel and operation of SSH clients to your liking. You can even save common collections of SSH settings in con- figuration files for ease of use.  We’ll be focusing on outgoing SSH use, running SSH clients to connect to remote hosts, using the components highlighted in Figure 7-1. A related topic, not covered in this chapter, is how to control incoming SSH connections to your account. That sort of access control is a function of the SSH server, not the clients, and is covered in Chapter 8.  How to Conﬁgure Clients  7.1 The clients ssh and scp are quite configurable, with many settings that can be changed to suit your whim. If you want to modify the behavior of these clients, three general techniques are at your disposal:  Command-line options  Configuration keywords  For changing the behavior of ssh or scp for a single invocation  For changes that remain in force until you change them again; these are stored in a client configuration file  Environment variables  For a few miscellaneous features  We now present a general overview of these three methods.  266  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Configuration types  Configuration types  SSH Client  SSH Server  Command-line  options  Environment  variables  User’s client  configuration file  Global client  configuration file  Compile-time  flags  Key-related  files  Known hosts databases  Command-line  options  Custom session  startup  Server-side  configuration file  Server-side  authorization files  Compile-time  flags  Target account’s authorization files  TCP-wrappers  files  Kerberos  configuration files  PAM files  Figure 7-1. Client configuration  highlighted parts   Command-Line Options  7.1.1 Command-line options let you change a client’s behavior just once, at invocation. For example, if you’re using ssh over a slow modem connection, you can tell it to compress the data with the –C command-line option:  $ ssh -C server.example.com  ssh, scp, and most of their support programs, when invoked with the --help option, will print a helpful summary describing all their command-line options.* For example:  $ ssh --help $ scp --help $ ssh-keygen -help  * Tectia recognizes –h as an abbreviation of --help.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.1 How to Configure Clients    267   Client Conﬁguration Files  7.1.2 If you don’t want to retype command-line options continually, configuration files let you change a client’s behavior now and in the future, until you change the configura- tion file again. For example, you can enable compression for all clients you invoke by inserting this line into a client configuration file:  In a client configuration file, client settings are changed by specifying keywords and values. In the example, the keyword is Compression and the value is yes. You may also separate the keyword and value with an equals sign, with optional whitespace:  Compression yes  Compression = yes  You may configure clients to behave differently for each remote host you visit. This can be done on the fly with command-line options, but for anything reasonably com- plex, you’ll end up typing long, inconvenient command lines like:  $ ssh -a -p 220 -c blowfish -l sally -i myself server.example.com  Alternatively, you can set these options within a configuration file. The following entry duplicates the function of the preceding command-line options, collecting them under the name “myserver”:   OpenSSH  Tectia's syntax differs slightly as we'll see later  Host myserver  ForwardAgent no  Port 220  Cipher blowfish  User sally  IdentityFile myself  HostName server.example.com  Now, to run a client with these options enabled, simply type:  $ ssh myserver  Configuration files take some time to set up, but in the long run they are significant timesavers. We now discuss the general structure of these files  host specifications followed by keyword value pairs , then dive into specific keywords.  Keywords versus command-line options  7.1.2.1 Configuration files and command-line options have two important relationships:    Every configuration keyword can appear on the command line with the –o  option.    Alternative configuration files are referenced with the –F option.  For any configuration line of the form:  Keyword Value  268    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

For example, the configuration file lines:  User sally Port 220  can be specified on the command line as:  $ ssh -o "User sally" -o "Port 220" server.example.com  As in the configuration file, an equals sign  with optional whitespace  is permitted between the keyword and the value:  $ ssh -o User=sally -o Port=220 server.example.com  If you use an equals sign, and the value for the keyword contains special characters that would be misinterpreted by the shell, surround the value with quotes.  The –o option may appear multiple times on the same command line, for both ssh and scp:    OpenSSH $ scp -o "User sally" -o "Port 220" myfile server.example.com:  The other relationship between command-line options and configuration keywords is found in the –F option, which instructs a client to use a different configuration file instead of the default. For example:  $ ssh -F  usr local ssh other_config  OpenSSH and Tectia treat the –F option differently. OpenSSH will ignore the default configuration file   etc ssh ssh_config  and use only the one you provide. Tectia, on the other hand, will still process its default configuration file   etc ssh2 ssh2_config , and then your pro- vided file can override those settings.  7.1.2.2 Global and local ﬁles Client configuration files come in two flavors. A single, global client configuration file, usually created by a system administrator, governs client behavior for an entire com- puter. The file is traditionally  etc ssh ssh_config  OpenSSH  or  etc ssh2 ssh2_config  Tectia .  Don’t confuse these with the server configuration files in the same directo- ries.  Each user may also create a local client configuration file within his or her account, usually ~ .ssh config  OpenSSH  or ~ .ssh2 ssh2_config  Tectia . This file con- trols the behavior of clients run in the user’s login session.*  * The system administrator may change the locations of client configuration files via the compile-time flag --with-etcdir [4.3.5.1] or the serverwide keyword UserConfigDirectory. [5.3.1.5] If the files aren’t in their default locations on your computer, contact your system administrator.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.1 How to Configure Clients    269   Values in a user’s local file take precedence over those in the global file. For instance, if the global file turns on data compression, and your local file turns it off, the local file wins for clients run in your account. We cover precedence in more detail later. [7.2]  Conﬁguration-ﬁle sections  7.1.2.3 Client configuration files are divided into sections. Each section contains settings for one remote host or for a set of related remote hosts, such as all hosts in a given domain.  The beginning of a section is marked differently in different SSH implementations. For OpenSSH, the keyword Host begins a new section, followed by a string called a host specification. The string may be a hostname:  Host server.example.com  an IP address:  Host 123.61.4.10  a nickname for a host: [7.1.2.5]  Host my-nickname  or a wildcard pattern representing a set of hosts, where ? matches any single charac- ter and * any sequence of characters  just like filename wildcards in your favorite Unix shell :  Host *.example.com Host 128.220.19.*  Some further examples of wildcards:  Host *.edu Host a* Host *1* Host *  Any hostname in the edu domain Any hostname whose name begins with “a” Any hostname  or IP address!  with 1 in it Any hostname or IP address  Tectia, in contrast, does not use a Host keyword. A new section is marked by a host specification string followed by a colon. This string may likewise be a computer name:  server.example.com:  an IP address:  123.61.4.10:  a nickname:  my-nickname:  or a wildcard pattern:  *.example.com: 128.220.19.*:  270    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You then follow the host-specification line with one or more settings, i.e., configura- tion keywords and values, as in the example we saw earlier. The following table con- trasts OpenSSH and Tectia configuration files:  OpenSSH Host myserver  User sally  IdentityFile myself  ForwardAgent no  Port 220  Cipher blowfish  Tectia myserver:  User sally  IdentityFile myself  ForwardAgent no  Port 220  Ciphers blowfish  The settings apply only to the hosts named in the host specification. The section ends at the next host specification or the end of the file, whichever comes first.  7.1.2.4 Multiple matches Because wildcards are permitted in host specifications, a single hostname might match two or more sections in the configuration file. For example, if one section begins:*  Host *.edu  and another begins:  Host *.harvard.edu  and you connect to server.harvard.edu, which section applies? Believe it or not, they both do. Every matching section applies, and if a keyword is set more than once with different values, only one value applies. For OpenSSH, the earliest value takes prece- dence, whereas for Tectia the latest value wins.  Suppose your client configuration file contains two sections to control data compres- sion, password authentication, and the ssh escape character:  Host *.edu  Compression yes  PasswordAuthentication yes  Host *.harvard.edu  Compression no  EscapeChar %  and you connect to server.harvard.edu:  $ ssh server.harvard.edu  Notice that the string server.harvard.edu matches both Host patterns, *.edu and *. harvard.edu. As we’ve said, the keywords in both sections apply to your connection.  * We use only the OpenSSH file syntax here to keep things tidy, but the explanation is true of Tectia as well.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.1 How to Configure Clients    271   Therefore, the preceding ssh command sets values for the keywords Compression, PasswordAuthentication, and EscapeChar.  But notice, in the example, that the two sections set different values for Compression. What happens? The rule is that the first value prevails—in this case, yes. So, in the previous example, the values used for server.harvard.edu are:  Compression yes PasswordAuthentication yes EscapeChar %  The first of the Compression lines Unique to first section Unique to second section  and as shown in Figure 7-2. Compression no is ignored because it is the second Compression line encountered. Likewise, if 10 different Host lines match server.harvard. edu, all 10 of those sections apply, and if a particular keyword is set multiple times, only the first value is used.  Client configuration file  Host *.edu  Compression yes  PasswordAuthentication yes  Host *.com  StrictHostKeyChecking yes  Host *.harvard.edu  Compression no  EscapeChar %  server.harvard.edu configuration  Compression yes PasswordAuthentication yes EscapeChar %  Figure 7-2. OpenSSH client configuration file with multiple matches  Tectia not shown   While this feature might seem confusing, it has useful properties. Suppose you want some settings applied to all remote hosts. Simply create a section beginning with:  Host *  and place the common settings within it. This section should be either the first or the last in the file. If first, its settings take precedence over any others. This can be used to guard against your own errors. For example, if you want to make sure you never, ever, accidentally use the old SSH-1 protocol, at the beginning of your configuration file put:   First section of file Host *  Protocol 2  Alternatively, if you place Host * as the last section in the configuration file, its set- tings are used only if no other section overrides them. This is useful for changing SSH’s default behavior, while still permitting overrides. For example, by default, data  272    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   compression is disabled. You can make it enabled by default by ending your configu- ration file with:   Last section of file Host *  Compression yes  Voilá, you have changed the default behavior of ssh and scp for your account! Any other section, earlier in the configuration file, can override this default simply by set- ting Compression to no.  The precedence rule is different for keywords that can apply multiple times in a section. For example, you can legitimately have more than one IdentityFile keyword in a section of ~ .ssh config  OpenSSH , meaning to try all the listed keys in turn. [7.4.2] Likewise, if more than one section applies to a host, and they each contain IdentityFile lines, then the union of all the named keys will be tried for authentica- tion. In other words, IdentityFile values accumulate rather than over- ride each other.  7.1.2.5 Making nicknames for hosts Suppose your client configuration file contains a section for the remote host myserver.example.com:  Host myserver.example.com  ...  One day, while logged onto ourclient.example.com, you decide to establish an SSH connection to myserver.example.com. Since both computers are in the same domain, example.com, you can omit the domain name on the command line and simply type:  $ ssh myserver  This does establish the SSH connection, but you run into an unexpected nuance of configuration files. ssh compares the command-line string “myserver” to the Host string “myserver.example.com”, determines that they don’t match, and doesn’t apply the section of the configuration file. Yes, the software requires an exact textual match between the hostnames on the command line and in the configuration file.  You can get around this limitation by declaring myserver to be a nickname for myserver.example.com. In OpenSSH, this is done with the Host and HostName key- words. Simply use Host with the nickname and HostName with the fully qualified host- name:   OpenSSH Host myserver  HostName myserver.example.com  ...  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.1 How to Configure Clients    273   ssh will now recognize that this section applies to your command ssh myserver. You may define any nickname you like for a given computer, even if it isn’t related to the original hostname:   OpenSSH Host simple  HostName myserver.example.com  ...  Then you can use the nickname on the command line:  $ ssh simple  For Tectia, the syntax is different but the effect is the same. Use the nickname in the host specification, and provide the full name to the Host keyword:   Tectia simple:  Host myserver.example.com  ...  Then type:  $ ssh simple  Host server.example.com  ...  Nicknames are convenient for testing new client settings. Suppose you have an OpenSSH configuration for server.example.com:  and you want to experiment with different settings. You could just modify the set- tings in place, but if they don’t work, you’d have to waste time changing them back. The following steps demonstrate a more convenient way:  1. Within the configuration file, make a copy of the section you want to change:  2. In the copy, change “Host” to “HostName”:   Original Host server.example.com  ...  Copy for testing Host server.example.com  ...   Original Host server.example.com  ...  Copy for testing HostName server.example.com  ...  ple, “Host my-test”:   Original Host server.example.com  274    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  3. Add a new Host line at the beginning of the copy, using a phony name; for exam-   4. Setup is done. In the copy  my-test , make all the changes you want and con- nect using ssh my-test. You can conveniently compare the old and new behavior by running ssh server.example.com versus ssh my-test. If you decide against the changes, simply delete the my-test section. If you like the changes, copy them to the original section  or delete the original and keep the copy .  ...  Copy for testing Host my-test  HostName server.example.com  ...  You can do the same with Tectia:   Original server.example.com:  ...  Copy for testing my-test:  Host server.example.com  ...  Comments, indenting, and style  7.1.2.6 You probably noticed in the previous examples that we use the  symbol to repre- sent comments:   This is a comment  In fact, any line beginning with  in the configuration file is treated as a comment and ignored. Likewise, blank lines  empty or containing only whitespace  are also ignored.  You might also have noticed that the lines following a host specification are indented:   OpenSSH Host server.example.com  Keyword1 value1  Keyword2 value2   Tectia server.example.com:  Keyword1 value1  Keyword2 value2  Indenting is considered good style because it visually indicates the beginning of a new section. It isn’t required, but we recommend it.  Environment Variables  7.1.3 SSH clients set a number of environment variables, and a few miscellaneous features are controlled by variables you can set. We’ll point out these variables as we  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.1 How to Configure Clients    275   encounter them from time to time. Environment variables may be set in your current shell by the standard methods:   C shell family  csh, tcsh  $ setenv MY_VARIABLE 1   Bourne shell family  sh, ksh, bash  $ MY_VARIABLE=1 $ export MY_VARIABLE  Alternatively, environment variables and values may be specified in a file. System administrators can set environment variables for all users in  etc environment, and users can set them in ~ .ssh environment  OpenSSH  and ~ .ssh2 environment  Tec- tia . These files contain lines of the format:  NAME=VALUE  where NAME is the name of an environment variable, and VALUE is its value. The value is taken literally, read from the equals sign to the end of the line. Don’t enclose the value in quotes, even if it contains whitespace, unless you want the quotes to be part of the value.  Precedence  7.2 Perhaps you are wondering: what happens if some configuration settings conflict? For instance, if you use the Compression keyword to turn compression off, and also the –C command-line option to turn it on, who wins? In other words, who has precedence?  For OpenSSH and Tectia clients, the order of precedence is, from strongest to weakest:  1. Command-line options 2. The user’s local client configuration file 3. The global client configuration file*  Command-line options have the highest precedence, overriding any client configura- tion files. The user’s local file has next highest precedence, and the global file has lowest precedence. So, in our compression example, –C takes precedence over the Compression keyword, and compression is enabled. If a setting isn’t changed by any keyword or command-line option, the client’s default setting is used.  Remember that we’re speaking only of outgoing connections initiated by clients. Incoming connections, controlled by the SSH server, have other precedence rules. For servers, the user’s local configuration file definitely does not override the global  * We don’t mention environment variables in this list because they don’t compete for precedence. Environ- ment variables control different features that don’t overlap with command-line options and configuration files.  276    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   file; otherwise, users could override global server settings, creating security holes and wreaking other havoc. [8.1.1]  Introduction to Verbose Mode  7.3 Now that we’ve covered the generalities of command-line options and configuration files, we’re about to launch into an extended discussion of configuration. Before we begin, let’s practice some defense. As you try these options, occasionally you might see behavior that’s not what you expected. Whenever this occurs, your first instinct should be: turn on verbose mode with the –v command-line option to track down the problem:  $ ssh -v server.example.com  In verbose mode, the client prints messages as it proceeds, providing clues to the problem. New SSH users  and quite a few experienced ones  frequently forget or neglect to use verbose mode when problems arise. Don’t hesitate! Many questions we’ve seen in the Usenet SSH newsgroup, comp.security.ssh [12.3], could have been answered immediately by running ssh –v and examining the output.  Suppose you just installed your public key on server.example.com and are trying to authenticate with it. Strangely, you are prompted for your login password instead of your public-key passphrase:  $ ssh server.example.com barrett@server.example.com's password:  Don’t just sit there scratching your head in wonder. Let verbose mode come to the rescue:  $ ssh -v server.example.com OpenSSH_3.8p1, SSH protocols 1.5 2.0, OpenSSL 0.9.7d 17 Mar 2004 debug1: Reading configuration data  etc ssh ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to server.example.com [192.168.0.10] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1:  Remote: Bad file modes for  users barrett .ssh debug1: Server refused our key. debug1: Doing password authentication. barrett@server.example.com's password:  Uh oh!  These messages  which are abbreviated for this example  confirm that the SSH con- nection is succeeding, but public-key authentication is failing. The reason is “bad file modes”: the remote SSH directory,  home barrett .ssh, has incorrect permissions. A quick trip to the server and a well-placed chmod command later, the problem is solved:   On the server $ chmod 700 ~ .ssh  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.3 Introduction to Verbose Mode    277   Repeating the –v option causes OpenSSH clients to produce even more detailed information:   OpenSSH $ ssh -v -v -v server.example.com  whereas for Tectia, use its –d option, as we saw in detail for sshd: [5.9]   Tectia $ ssh -d3 server.example.com  And of course, verbose mode also works for scp:  $ scp -v myfile server.example.com: Executing: program  usr bin ssh host server.example.com, user  unspecified , command scp -v -t . OpenSSH_3.9p1, SSH protocols 1.5 2.0, OpenSSL 0.9.7e 24 Oct 2004 ...  except that Tectia’s scp uses –D instead of –d:*   Tectia $ scp -D3 myfile server.example.com:  scp also supports the –q option for no output at all:   Tectia $ scp -q myfile server.example.com: Be completely quiet  Verbose mode is your friend. Use it liberally. Now we’re ready to learn those dozens of options.  Client Conﬁguration in Depth  7.4 ssh and scp take their cues from command-line options, configuration-file keywords, and environment variables. OpenSSH and Tectia clients behave differently and obey different settings, but as usual, we cover them simultaneously. When a setting is sup- ported by only some of these products, we’ll say so.  Both OpenSSH and Tectia ssh will print a usage message briefly describing all its options:  $ ssh --help  You can get the same effect if you omit all arguments  OpenSSH  or use –h  Tectia . Tectia will also print its version number on request, with the –V option:   Tectia $ ssh -V ssh: SSH Tectia Server 4.2.1 on i686-pc-linux-gnu Build: 1 Released 2004-11-30  YYYY-MM-DD . Crypto library version: SSH Cryptographic Library, version 1.2.4  * Tectia’s –v option is equivalent to –D2, and can also be written as --verbose.  278    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   FIPS certification mode: DISABLED Product: SSH Tectia Server  T  License type: commercial  Remote Account Name  7.4.1 ssh and scp assume that your local and remote usernames are the same. If your local username is henry and you run:  $ ssh server.example.com  ssh assumes your remote username is also henry and requests a connection to that account on server.example.com. If your remote account name differs from the local one, you must tell the SSH client your remote account name. For henry to connect to a remote account called sally, he can use the –l command-line option:  $ ssh -l sally server.example.com  If copying files with scp, the syntax is different for specifying the remote account name, looking more like an email address. [7.5.1] To copy the file myfile to the remote account sally on server.example.com:  $ scp myfile sally@server.example.com:  If you frequently connect to a remote machine using a different username, instead of monkeying with command-line options specify the remote username in your client configuration file. The User keyword serves this purpose, and both ssh and scp pay attention to it. Here’s how to declare that your remote username is sally on a given remote host:  OpenSSH Host server.example.com  User sally  Tectia server.example.com:  User sally  Now, when connecting to server.example.com, you don’t have to specify that your remote username is sally:   The remote username sally will be used automatically $ ssh server.example.com  Tricks with remote account names  7.4.1.1 With User and nicknames, you can significantly shorten the command lines you type for ssh and scp. Continuing the preceding example with sally, if you have the config- uration shown:  OpenSSH Host simple  HostName server.example.com  User sally  Tectia simple:  Host server.example.com  User sally  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    279   then these long commands:  $ ssh server.example.com -l sally $ scp myfile sally@server.example.com:  may be reduced to:  $ ssh simple $ scp myfile simple:  Here’s how to specify separately several different account names on different hosts, each in its own section of the configuration file:  OpenSSH Host server.example.com  User sally  ... Host another.example.com  User sharon  ...  Tectia server.example.com:  User sally  ... another.example.com:  User sharon  ...  This technique is convenient if you have only one account on each remote machine. But suppose you have two accounts on server.example.com, called sally and sally2. Is there some way to specify both in the configuration file? The following attempt doesn’t work  we show OpenSSH syntax only :   THIS WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY!!! Host server.example.com  User sally  User sally2  Compression yes  because only the first value  sally  prevails. To get around this limitation, you can use nicknames to create two sections for the same machine in your configuration file, each with a different User:   OpenSSH  Section 1: Convenient access to the sally account Host sally-account  HostName server.example.com  User sally  Compression yes   Section 2: Convenient access to the sally2 account Host sally2-account  HostName server.example.com  User sally2  Compression yes  Now you can access the two accounts easily by nickname:  $ ssh sally-account $ ssh sally2-account  This works, but it isn’t ideal. You’ve duplicated your settings  HostName and Compression  in each section. Duplication makes a configuration file harder to  280    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   maintain, since any future changes need to be applied twice.  In general, duplication isn’t good software engineering.  Are you doomed to duplicate? No, there’s a better solution. Immediately after the two sections, create a third section with a Host wild- card that matches both sally-account and sally2-account. Suppose you use sally*- account and move all duplicated settings into this new section:   OpenSSH Host sally*-account  HostName server.example.com  Compression yes  The end result is:  OpenSSH Host sally-account  User sally Host sally2-account  User sally2 Host sally*-account  HostName server.example.com  Compression yes  Tectia sally-account:  User sally sally2-account:  User sally2 sally*-account:  Host server.example.com  Compression yes  Since sally*-account matches both previous sections, its full name and compression settings apply to both sally-account and sally2-account. Any settings that differ between sally-account and sally2-account  in this case, User  are kept in their respective sections. You’ve now achieved the same effect as in the previous example—two accounts with different settings on the same remote machine—but with no duplication of settings.  User Identity  7.4.2 SSH identifies you by an identity represented by a key pair  OpenSSH  or a collec- tion of key pairs  Tectia . [6.1] Normally, SSH clients use your default key file  OpenSSH  or default identification file  Tectia  to establish an authenticated con- nection. However, if you’ve created other keys, you may instruct SSH clients to use them to establish your identity. A command-line option  –i  and configuration key- word  IdentityFile  are available for this purpose.  In OpenSSH, for example, if you have a private-key file called my-key, you can make clients use it with the commands:  $ ssh -i my-key server.example.com $ scp -i my-key myfile server.example.com:  or with the configuration keyword:  IdentityFile my-key  The file location is assumed to be relative to the current directory, i.e., in these cases the file is . my-key.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    281   Tectia also has –i and IdentityFile, but their meanings are slightly different from those of OpenSSH. Instead of a key file, you supply the name of an identification file:   Tectia $ ssh -i my-id-file server.example.com   Tectia configuration file IdentityFile my-id-file  If Tectia complains about your identity file:  warning:  home smith .ssh2 id_dsa_2048_a: 4: parsing line failed.  you probably handed ssh a key file  id_dsa_2048_a  instead of an iden- tity file like ~ .ssh2 identification.  Multiple identities can be quite useful. [6.4] For example, you can set up your remote account to run specific programs when a second key is used. The ordinary command:  $ ssh server.example.com  initiates a regular login session, but:  $ ssh -i other_identity server.example.com  can run a complex batch process on server.example.com. Using configuration key- words, you can accomplish the same effect by specifying an alternative identity, as shown in this table:  Tectia SomeComplexAction:  Host server.example.com  IdentityFile other_identity  ...  OpenSSH Host SomeComplexAction  HostName server.example.com  IdentityFile other_identity  ...  You can then invoke:  $ ssh SomeComplexAction  or:   OpenSSH Host server.example.com  IdentityFile id1  OpenSSH can specify multiple identities in a single command:*   OpenSSH $ ssh -i id1 -i id2 -i id3 server.example.com  * Tectia accomplishes the same thing with identification files, which may contain multiple keys.  282    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    IdentityFile id2  IdentityFile id3  Multiple identities are tried in order until one successfully authenticates. However, OpenSSH limits you to 100 identities per command.*  If you plan to use multiple identities frequently, remember that an SSH agent can eliminate hassle. Simply load each identity’s key into the agent using ssh-add, and you won’t have to remember multiple passphrases while you work.  7.4.2.1 Using identities IdentityFile specifies an identity you’d like to use for authentication, but it does not restrict authentication to that identity. Suppose your client configuration file says:   OpenSSH Host server.example.com  IdentityFile wendy  IdentityFile abby  and you run:   OpenSSH $ ssh server.example.com   OpenSSH Host server.example.com  IdentityFile wendy  IdentityFile abby  IdentitiesOnly yes  ssh will dutifully try to authenticate using identities wendy and abby; but if it fails, ssh will try other identities held in your SSH agent, in case one of them might suc- ceed. You can change this behavior with the IdentitiesOnly keyword:  Restrict authentication only to listed identity files  Now if ssh fails to authenticate by identities wendy and abby, it will stop trying  and move on to other non-public-key techniques, if configured to do so .  This feature is particularly useful with a server that limits the number of public-key authentication attempts, such as OpenSSH. If you have many keys in your agent, only a few can be tried before the server disconnects you for “too many failures.” The configuration shown avoids this problem by indicating exactly which keys to use for a given host. Even though the IdentityFile keyword refers to files, the OpenSSH client will try those keys from the agent if they’ve been loaded. You are prompted for a passphrase only if the needed key isn’t in the agent and is encrypted on disk.  * Per the constant SSH_MAX_IDENTITY_FILES in the source code.

All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    283   Host Keys and Known-Hosts Databases  7.4.3 Every SSH server has a host key [3.3] that uniquely identifies the server to clients. This key helps prevent spoofing attacks. When an SSH client requests a connection and receives the server’s host key, the client checks it against a local database of known host keys. If the keys match, the connection proceeds. If they don’t, the cli- ent behaves according to several options you can control.  In OpenSSH, the host key database is maintained partly in a serverwide location   etc  ssh ssh_known_hosts  and partly in the user’s SSH directory  ~ .ssh known_hosts . In Tectia, there are two databases of host keys for authenticating server hosts  the “host- keys” map in  etc ssh2 hostkeys  and client hosts  the “knownhosts” map ; in this sec- tion we are concerned only with the former. Similar to its OpenSSH counterpart, the Tectia hostkeys map is maintained in a serverwide directory   etc ssh2 hostkeys   and a per-account directory  ~ .ssh2 hostkeys  . In this section, we refer to the OpenSSH and Tectia map simply as the host key database.  Strict host-key checking  7.4.3.1 Suppose you request an SSH connection with server.example.com, which sends its host key in response. Your client looks up server.example.com in its host key data- base. Ideally, a match is found and the connection proceeds. But what if this doesn’t happen? Two scenarios may arise:  SCENARIO 1: Mismatched key  A host key is found for server.example.com in the database, but it doesn’t match the incoming key. This can indicate a security hazard, or it can mean that server. example.com has changed its host key, which can happen legitimately. [3.9.4]  SCENARIO 2: No key  No host key for server.example.com exists in the database. In this case, the SSH client is encountering server.example.com for the first time.  In each scenario, should the client proceed or fail? Should it store the new host key in the database, or not? These decisions the keyword StrictHostKeyChecking, which may have three values:  controlled by  are  yes  no  Be strict. If a key is unknown or has changed, the connection fails. This is the most secure value, but it can be inconvenient or annoying if you connect to new hosts regularly or if your remote host keys change frequently.  Not strict. If a key is unknown, automatically add it to the user’s database and proceed. If a key has changed, leave the known hosts entry intact, print a warn- ing, and permit the connection to proceed. This is the least secure value.  284    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ask  Prompt the user. If a key is unknown, ask whether it should be added to the user’s database and whether to connect. If a key has changed, ask whether to connect. This is the default and a sensible value for knowledgeable users.  Less- experienced users might misunderstand what they’re being asked and make the wrong decision.   Here’s an example:  StrictHostKeyChecking yes  Table 7-1 summarizes SSH’s StrictHostKeyChecking’s behavior.  Table 7-1. StrictHostKeyChecking behavior  Key found? Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No  Match? Yes No No No – – –  Strict? – Yes No Ask Yes No Ask  Action Connect Warn and fail Warn and connect Warn and ask whether to connect Warn and fail Add key and connect Ask whether to add key and to connect  OpenSSH has an additional keyword, CheckHostIP, to make a client verify the IP address of an SSH server in the database. Its values may be yes  the default, to verify the address  or no. The value yes provides security against name service spoofing attacks: [3.9.2]   OpenSSH CheckHostIP no  Verifying host keys by DNS  7.4.3.2 The known-hosts mechanism for verifying hostkeys is fine when dealing with a handful of hosts, but quickly becomes unwieldy for larger numbers. Later we dis- cuss overarching authentication systems such as PKI or Kerberos to address this problem. [11.5] Another method is to use the DNS: if we could attach hostkeys to domain names, then SSH could verify the server by looking up its keys in the DNS. The method is documented in draft-ietf-secsh-dns. It uses DNS resource records with the following format:  IN SSHFP        where the key types can be 1  for RSA  or 2  DSS , and the fingerprint type can be 1  for SHA-1 .  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    285   ssh-keygen can generate these DNS records in a form ready to be included in a zone file for the BIND nameserver:   OpenSSH $ ssh-keygen -r host.domain.net -f  etc ssh ssh_host_dsa_key.pub host.domain.net IN SSHFP 2 1 7ae79057cbff7de6d61b30fba02d936d6a0f5b5f  $ ssh-keygen -r host.domain.net -f  etc ssh ssh_host_dsa_key.pub -g host.domain.net IN TYPE44 \ 22 02 01 7ae79057cbff7de6d61b30fba02d936d6a0f5b5f  The –g form is for nameservers that don’t understand the SSHFP RR type.  To have OpenSSH use these DNS records, set the VerifyHostDNS keyword to yes, no, or ask:   ~ ssh config VerifyHostKeyDNS=yes  It’s vitally important to remember that the DNS itself is usually not secure! There is a standard for DNS security  DNSSEC, RFC-2535 , but it is not much used yet. With- out DNSSEC, DNS queries and replies can be easily intercepted and forged by attackers, so this level of hostkey verification may not be acceptable.  If VerifyHostKeyDNS is ask, and StrictHostKeyChecking is yes or ask, OpenSSH will indicate whether it found a matching hostkey in the DNS, but still obey the usual semantics of StrictHostKeyChecking in deciding whether to approve the server. VerifyHostKeyDNS yes is the same, except that matching fingerprints obtained via secure DNS are considered just as trustworthy as those stored in the known-hosts list. If StrictHostKeyChecking is no, then VerifyHostKeyDNS makes no difference.  7.4.3.3 Host key aliasing OpenSSH uses a simple method to find the host key for server authentication: it sim- ply looks up in the known-hosts list exactly what you type on the command line for the remote server name. Sometimes, the situation is more complicated; you know which host you’re actually contacting, but OpenSSH doesn’t. For instance, you might be using SSH-over-SSH to contact a remote host through a second SSH port forwarding, like so:  $ ssh -L 2001:david:22 goliath $ ssh -p 2001 localhost  The second command will connect to the SSH server david through another one, goliath. However, the second ssh may complain about a host-key mismatch. It has no way of knowing about the port-forwarding indirection; it thinks you are connecting to an SSH server which is actually running on the local host, compares goliath’s host- key to that of the local host, and finds they do not match. In this situation, you can tell OpenSSH which key to use with HostKeyAlias:   OpenSSH $ ssh -p 2001 -o HostKeyAlias=david localhost  286    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Ignoring host keys for localhost  7.4.3.4 In many computing environments, users’ home directories are shared across many machines. As a result, users’ ~ .ssh configuration files are shared in this manner. This is useful but has one little glitch: the idiom ssh localhost.  The problem is that “localhost” means something different on every host! The first time you run this command, ssh will add a key for “localhost” to your known-hosts file—but the next time you do it on a different machine, SSH will complain about a host-key mismatch! You could get around this by adding multiple “localhost” lines to the known-hosts list, expanding the set of keys acceptable for that destination. However, since there’s little security to be gained in verifying the identity of the host you’re already logged into, OpenSSH has a special option, NoHostAuthentication- ForLocalhost, to disable server authentication for the connections to the loopback address:   ~ .ssh config NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes  7.4.3.5 Moving the known hosts ﬁles OpenSSH permits the locations of the host key database, both the serverwide and per-account parts, to be changed using configuration keywords. GlobalKnown- HostsFile defines an alternative location for the serverwide file. It doesn’t actually move the file—only the system administrator can do that—but it does force your cli- ents to use another file in its place. This keyword is useful if the default file is out- dated and you want your clients to ignore the serverwide file, particularly if you’re tired of seeing warning messages from your clients about changed keys:   OpenSSH GlobalKnownHostsFile  users smith .ssh my_global_hosts_file  Similarly, you can change the location of your per-user part of the database with the keyword UserKnownHostsFile:   OpenSSH UserKnownHostsFile  users smith .ssh my_local_hosts_file  SSH Protocol Settings  7.4.4 OpenSSH lets the client control a number of features relating to the SSH protocol itself.  Choosing a protocol version  7.4.4.1 OpenSSH supports protocols SSH-1 and SSH-2. By default, the client and server will try to negotiate an SSH-2 connection first, then fall back to an SSH-1 connection if unsuccessful. You can control which protocols are tried by the client, and in what order, with the Protocol keyword, just as for the server: [5.3.7]   OpenSSH Protocol 2,1  Comma-separated list of protocol versions  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    287   You should always use SSH-2 for maximum security, if your software supports it, so it’s a good idea to instruct your clients to avoid SSH-1 servers. You can do this for all hosts by placing a Protocol line at the bottom of your ~ .ssh config file:   OpenSSH Host *  Protocol 2  or by the command-line arguments –1 and –2, for protocols SSH-1 and SSH-2, respectively:   OpenSSH $ ssh -2 server.example.com    Require an SSH-2 connection  Tectia supports the –1 option, with required qualifiers t and i to control how the SSH-1 support is accomplished:   Tectia $ ssh-1t server.example.com     “traditional”: invoke an external ssh1 program $ ssh-1i server.example.com     “internal”: do SSH-1 protocol internally  Connection sharing  7.4.4.2 A single SSH connection can have multiple channels simultaneously supporting a variety of services: interactive terminals, remote program execution, file transfer, agent forwarding, etc. [3.4.4.1] Setting up an SSH connection is a computationally expensive process, and can take a few seconds. That’s no big deal if you do it once in a while, but if you have a procedure that makes many connections, the delay can get pretty annoying or problematic. The Unix “style” promotes this problem: for instance, you can use CVS over SSH by setting the environment variable CVS_RSH=ssh. If you’re running a lot of CVS commands, however, each will now take an extra five seconds or so, and computer users are notoriously impatient. Given that SSH can use channels, wouldn’t it be better to set up one SSH connection to a given host, and then somehow issue our various commands over that one session?  Well, yes it would, and OpenSSH has this feature in its ControlMaster and ControlPath keywords, and the –M and –S options of ssh. This command:   OpenSSH $ ssh -S  tmp ssh-snowcrash -Mfn snowcrash.neal.org  opens an SSH connection to the server snowcrash.neal.org, placing it in the back- ground. It also tells this SSH process to act as a “master” process, allowing other ssh invocations  its “slaves”  to open channels to this server through it. Master and slave communicate via the Unix socket  tmp ssh-snowcrash. So this:   OpenSSH $ ssh -S  tmp ssh-snowcrash snowcrash.neal.org  will open a remote terminal on snowcrash, and will do it quickly because no new SSH connection is set up; it goes through the existing connection. You can make this more convenient with custom configuration:  288    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    ~ .ssh config host snowcrash-master   hostname snowcrash.neal.org   ControlPath  tmp ssh-snowcrash   ControlMaster  host snowcrash-slave   hostname snowcrash.neal.org   ControlPath  tmp ssh-snowcrash  And thus you can efficiently run:   OpenSSH $ ssh -fn snowcrash-master $ ssh snowcrash-slave   OpenSSH SendEnv COLOR   OpenSSH SendEnv LANG LC_* SendEnv PATH TERM TZ   Tectia SetRemoteEnv COLOR=blue  Setting environment variables in the server  7.4.4.3 SSH clients can set environment variables in their remote SSH sessions. This mecha- nism is supported only by the SSH-2 protocol, and works only if it is permitted by the server, according to the keywords AcceptEnv  OpenSSH  or Settable- EnvironmentVars  Tectia . [5.6.2]  OpenSSH clients use the SendEnv keyword to specify the names of environment vari- ables that are sent to the server:  Multiple variables can be listed, separated by whitespace, or specified by multiple keywords. Wildcard characters * and ? send all variables in the client’s environment whose name matches the pattern:  The value for each variable is copied from the environment of the OpenSSH client.  Tectia clients use the SetRemoteEnv keyword to specify both the name and the value, separated by an equals sign  with no whitespace :  Use multiple keywords to send several variables to the server. Each variable must be named explicitly: no wildcards or patterns are used. The value can be omitted  to indicate an empty string , but the equals sign is required. Whitespace is permitted within the value, and is copied verbatim:   Tectia SetRemoteEnv GRANDDAUGHTERS=katie rebecca sarah  Note that the Tectia client’s environment is not consulted at all, and the variables that are sent to the server need not even be present in the environment of the client.

All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    289   TCP IP Settings  7.4.5 SSH uses TCP IP as its transport mechanism. Most times you don’t need to change the default TCP settings, but in some situations it’s necessary:    Connecting to SSH servers on other TCP ports   Connecting via a particular network interface   Using privileged versus nonprivileged ports   Keeping an idle connection open by sending keepalive messages   Enabling the Nagle Algorithm  TCP_NODELAY    Requiring IP addresses to be Version 4 or 6  Selecting a remote port  7.4.5.1 Most SSH servers listen on TCP port 22, so clients connect to this port by default. Nevertheless, sometimes you need to connect to an SSH server on a different port number. For example, if you are a system administrator testing a new SSH server, you might run it on a different port to avoid interference with an existing server. Then your clients need to connect to this alternate port. This can be done with the client’s Port keyword, followed by a port number:  Port 2035  or the –p command-line option, followed by the port number:  $ ssh -p 2035 server.example.com  You can also specify an alternative port for scp, but the command-line option is –P instead of –p:*  $ scp -P 2035 myfile server.example.com:  Tectia also accepts a port number as part of the user and host specification, pre- ceded by a hash sign. For example, the commands:   Tectia $ ssh server.example.com2035 $ ssh smith@server.example.com2035 $ scp smith@server.example.com2035:myfile localfile  each connect to remote port 2035.  We don’t see much use for this syntax, but it’s available.   After connecting to the server, ssh sets an environment variable in the remote shell to hold the port information. For OpenSSH, the variable is called SSH_CLIENT, and for Tectia it is SSH2_CLIENT. The variable contains a string with three values, sepa- rated by a space character: the client’s IP address, the client’s TCP port, and the  * scp already has a lowercase –p option that means “preserve file permissions.” [7.5.4]  290    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   server’s TCP port. For example, if your client originates from port 1016 on IP address 24.128.23.102, connecting to the server’s port 22, the value is:   OpenSSH $ echo $SSH_CLIENT ::ffff:24.128.23.102 1016 22   Tectia $ echo $SSH2_CLIENT 24.128.23.102 1016 22  OpenSSH also sets an environment variable, SSH_CONNECTION, with slightly extended port information, appending the server’s IP address and port:   OpenSSH $ echo $SSH_CONNECTION ::ffff:24.128.23.102 10969 ::ffff:128.220.67.30 22  These variables are useful for scripting. In your shell’s startup file  e.g., ~ .profile, ~ .login , you can test for the variable and, if it exists, take actions. For example:  ! bin sh  Test for an SSH_CLIENT value of nonzero length if [ -n "$SSH_CLIENT" ] then  We logged in via SSH.   echo 'Welcome, OpenSSH user!'    Extract the IP address from SSH_CLIENT   IP=`echo $SSH_CLIENT  awk '{print $1}'`    Translate it to a hostname.   HOSTNAME=`host $IP  grep Name:  awk '{print $2}'`   echo "I see you are connecting from $HOSTNAME." else    We logged in not by SSH, but by some other means.   echo 'Welcome, O clueless one. Feeling insecure today?' fi  Connecting via a given network interface  7.4.5.2 If your client machine has more than one network interface or IP address, OpenSSH clients can connect through a particular one with the BindAddress keyword:   OpenSSH BindAddress 192.168.10.235  or the –b command-line option:   OpenSSH $ ssh -b 192.168.10.235 server.example.com  Forcing a nonprivileged local port  7.4.5.3 SSH connections get locally bound to a privileged TCP port, one whose port num- ber is below 1024. If you ever need to override this feature—say, if your connection  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    291   must pass through a firewall that doesn’t permit privileged source ports—use the configuration keyword UsePrivilegedPort. Its values are yes  use a privileged port  and no  use a nonprivileged port, the default :   OpenSSH UsePrivilegedPort no  Hostbased authentication requires a privileged port.  Keepalive messages  7.4.5.4 The TCPKeepAlive  OpenSSH  and KeepAlive  Tectia  keywords instruct the client how to proceed if a TCP connection problem occurs, such as a prolonged network outage or a server machine crash:   OpenSSH TCPKeepAlive yes   Tectia KeepAlive yes  The value yes  the default  tells the client to transmit and expect periodic keepalive messages. If the client detects a lack of responses to these messages, it shuts down the connection. The value no means not to use keepalive messages.  Keepalive messages represent a trade-off. If they are enabled, a faulty connection is shut down even if the problem is transient. However, the TCP keepalive timeout on which this feature is based is typically several hours, so this shouldn’t be a big prob- lem. If keepalive messages are disabled, an unused faulty connection can persist indefinitely.  TCP keepalive messages are generally more useful in the SSH server, since a user sit- ting on the client side will certainly notice if the connection becomes unresponsive. However, SSH can connect two programs together, with the one running the SSH cli- ent waiting for input from the other side. In such a situation, it may be necessary to detect dead connections eventually.  TCPKeepAlive and KeepAlive aren’t intended to deal with the problem of SSH ses- sions being torn down because of firewall, proxying, NAT, or IP masquerading time- outs. [5.3.3.4] In these cases, if you don’t send any data for some period of time, the firewall  or whatever  closes the TCP connection. Additionally, TCP keepalive mes- sages are not secure, as they don’t use any real authentication technique.  OpenSSH provides a robust and secure solution to keep the connection up, called client-alive and server-alive messages. OpenSSH clients can send client-alive mes- sages to the server, indicating the client is up. The client also detects server-alive messages sent by the OpenSSH server. [5.3.3.4]  If certain criteria are met, the client or server will tear down the connection. You can control this at three levels. First, the client’s initial connection to the server can obey  292    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   a timeout. If the server hasn’t responded at all within a certain number of seconds, the client will give up. This is controlled by the ConnectTimeout keyword:   OpenSSH ConnectTimeout 60  If no connection with the server within one minute, give up  Next, the ServerAliveInterval keyword controls how the client sends server-alive messages. Its argument is a length of time in seconds:   OpenSSH ServerAliveInterval 300  Send server-alive every 300 seconds, or five minutes  If your client hasn’t heard from the server within the given amount of time, the cli- ent will send a server-alive message to the server. It will continue sending these mes- sages at the given interval  in this case, every five minutes  until it receives a response or third keyword, ServerAliveCountMax, representing the maximum number of consecutive server-alive messages the client will send:  gives up. You control how it  gives up with the   OpenSSH ServerAliveCountMax 8  Try eight times, then give up. The default is three times.  Once this maximum is reached, the client says, “Oh well, I guess the server has gone out for a walk,” and terminates the SSH connection. If you don’t want the client to send server-alive messages, set ServerAliveInterval to zero.  Controlling TCP_NODELAY  7.4.5.5 TCP IP has a feature called the Nagle Algorithm, an optimization for reducing the number of TCP segments sent with very small amounts of data. [5.3.3.9] Tectia cli- ents may also enable or disable the Nagle Algorithm using the NoDelay keyword:   Tectia NoDelay yes  Legal values are yes  to disable the algorithm  and no  to enable it; the default .  Requiring IPv4 and IPv6  7.4.5.6 OpenSSH can force its clients to use Internet Protocol Version 4  IPv4  or 6  IPv6  addresses. IPv4 is the current version of IP used on the Internet; IPv6 is the future version, permitting far more addresses than IPv4 can support. For more information on these address formats, visit:  http:  www.ipv6.org   To force IPv4 addressing, use the –4 flag:   OpenSSH $ ssh -4 server.example.com  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    293   or likewise for IPv6, use –6:   OpenSSH $ ssh -6 server.example.com  You can also control these settings with the AddressFamily keyword, with the values inet  IPv4 only , inet6  IPv6 only , or any:   OpenSSH AddressFamily inet6  Use IPv6 only  Making Connections  7.4.6 Under the best conditions, an SSH client attempts a secure connection, succeeds, obtains your authentication credentials, and executes whatever command you’ve requested, be it a shell or otherwise. Various steps in this process are configurable, including:    The number of times the client attempts the connection   The look and behavior of the password prompt  for password authentication    Suppressing all prompting   Running remote commands interactively with a tty   Running remote commands in the background   Whether or not to fall back to an insecure connection, if a secure one can’t be  only   established    The escape character for interrupting and resuming an SSH session  7.4.6.1 Number of connection attempts If you run an OpenSSH client and it can’t establish a secure connection, it will retry. By default, tries once. You can change this behavior with the keyword ConnectionAttempts:  it   OpenSSH ConnectionAttempts 10  In this example, ssh tries 10 times before admitting defeat. Most people don’t have much use for this keyword, but it might be helpful if your network is unreliable. Just for fun, you can force ssh to give up immediately by setting ConnectionAttempts equal to zero:   OpenSSH $ ssh -o ConnectionAttempts=0 server.example.com ssh: connect to host server.example.com port 22: Success $  ssh has exited: no connection was made  294    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Password prompting in OpenSSH  7.4.6.2 If you’re using password authentication in OpenSSH, you may control the number of times you are prompted for your password if mistyped. By default, you’re prompted three times, and if you mistype the password repeatedly, the client exits. You can change this number with the keyword NumberOfPasswordPrompts:*    OpenSSH NumberOfPasswordPrompts 2  Now your SSH client provides only two chances to type your password correctly.  Password prompting in Tectia  7.4.6.3 Tectia adds flexibility to password prompting. Instead of preset prompt strings, you can design your own with the PasswordPrompt keyword:   Tectia PasswordPrompt Enter your password right now, infidel:  You can insert the remote username or hostname with the symbols %U  remote user- name  or %H  remote hostname . For a typical username@hostname prompt you could use:   Tectia PasswordPrompt "%U@%H's password:"  Or you can be fancier:   Tectia PasswordPrompt "Welcome %U! Please enter your %H password:"  7.4.6.4 Batch mode: suppressing prompts In some cases, you don’t want to be prompted for your password or passphrase. If ssh is invoked by an unattended shell script, for example, nobody will be at the key- board to type a password. This is why SSH batch mode exists. In batch mode, all prompting for authentication credentials is suppressed. The keyword BatchMode can have a value of yes  disable prompting  or no  the default, with prompting enabled :  BatchMode yes  Batch mode may be enabled for scp also with the –B option, for OpenSSH:   OpenSSH $ scp -B myfile server.example.com:  Batch mode doesn’t replace authentication. If a password or passphrase is required, you can’t magically log in without it by suppressing the prompt. If you try, your client exits with an error message such as “permission denied.” In order for batch mode to  * Although this is a client setting, the SSH server ultimately controls how many authentication attempts to  accept.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

[11.1]  Pseudo-terminal allocation  TTY PTY PTTY   7.4.6.5 A Unix tty  pronounced as it’s spelled, T-T-Y  is a software abstraction representing a computer terminal, originally an abbreviation for “teletype.” As part of an interac- tive session with a Unix machine, a tty is allocated to process keyboard input, limit screen output to a given number of rows and columns, and handle other terminal- related activities. Since most terminal-like connections don’t involve an actual hard- ware terminal, but rather a window, a software construct called a pseudo-tty  or pty, pronounced P-T-Y  handles this sort of connection.  When a client requests an SSH connection, the server doesn’t necessarily allocate a pty for the client. It does so, of course, if the client requests an interactive terminal session, e.g., just ssh host. But if you ask ssh to run a simple command on a remote server, such as ls:  $ ssh remote.server.com  bin ls  no interactive terminal session is needed, just a quick dump of the output of ls. In fact, by default sshd doesn’t allocate a pty for such a command. On the other hand, if you try running an interactive command like the text editor Emacs in this manner, you get an error message:  because Emacs is a screen-based program intended for a terminal. In such cases, you can request that SSH allocate a pty using the –t option:  Tectia also has the keyword ForcePTTYAllocation, which does the same thing as –t.*  $ ssh remote.server.com emacs -nw emacs: standard input is not a tty  $ ssh -t server.example.com emacs   Tectia ForcePTTYAllocation yes  Also, OpenSSH can request not to use a pty with the –T option, though most of the time this isn’t needed:   OpenSSH $ ssh -T server.example.com who barrett      :0           Aug 25 21:51   console  byrnes       pts 1        Aug 25 15:19   yoyodyne.org  silverman    pts 2        Aug 22 09:42   client.example.com   If SSH allocates a pty, it also automatically defines an environment variable in the remote shell. The variable is SSH_TTY  for OpenSSH  or SSH2_TTY  for Tectia  and con- tains the name of the character device file connected to the “slave” side of the pty,  * The no-pty option in the authorization file can override this request for a tty. [8.2.8]  296    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   the side that emulates a real tty. We can see this in action with a few simple com- mands. Try printing the value of SSH_TTY on a remote machine. If no tty is allocated, the result is blank:  $ ssh server.example.com 'echo $SSH_TTY$SSH_TTY2' [no output]  If you force allocation, the result is the name of the tty:  $ ssh -t server.example.com 'echo $SSH_TTY$SSH_TTY2'  dev pts 1  Thanks to this variable, you can run shell scripts on the remote machine that use this information. For example, here’s a script that runs your default editor only if a termi- nal is available:  ! bin sh if [ -n $SSH_TTY -o -n $SSH2_TTY ]; then    echo 'Success!'    exec $EDITOR else    echo "Sorry, interactive commands require a tty" fi  $ ssh server.example.com myscript Sorry, interactive commands require a tty $ ssh -t server.example.com myscript Success! ...Emacs runs...  Place this script in your remote account, calling it myscript  or whatever , and run:  7.4.6.6 Backgrounding a remote command If you try running an SSH remote command in the background, you might be sur- prised by the result. After the remote command runs to completion, the client auto- matically suspends before the output is printed:  $ ssh server.example.com ls & [1]  11910 $ ... time passes ... [1] + Stopped  SIGTTIN         ssh server.example.com ls &  This happens because ssh is attempting to read from standard input while in the background, which causes the shell to suspend ssh. To see the resulting output, you must bring ssh into the foreground:  $ fg README myfile myfile2  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    297   ssh provides the –n command-line option to get around this problem. It redirects standard input to come from  dev null, which prevents ssh from blocking for input. Now when the remote command finishes, the output is printed immediately:  $ ssh -n server.example.com ls & [1]  11912 $ ... time passes ... README myfile myfile2   Tectia DontReadStdin yes  Tectia has a keyword, DontReadStdin, that does the same thing as –n, accepting the values yes or no  the default is no :  7.4.6.7 Backgrounding a remote command, take two The preceding section assumed you didn’t need to type a password or passphrase, e.g., that you’re running an SSH agent. What happens if you use –n or Tectia’s DontReadStdin but the SSH client needs to read a password or passphrase from you?  $ ssh -n server.example.com ls & $ Enter passphrase for RSA key 'smith@client':  STOP! Don’t type your passphrase! Because the command is run in the background with –n, the prompt is also printed in the back- ground. If you respond, your password will be visible! This is because you will be typing to the shell, not the ssh prompt.  You need a solution that not only disables input and sends the process into the back- ground, but also permits ssh to prompt you. This is the purpose of the –f command- line option, which instructs ssh to do the following, in order:  1. Perform authentication, including any prompting 2. Cause the process to read from  dev null, exactly like –n 3. Put the process into the background: no “&” is needed  Here’s an example:  $ ssh -f server.example.com ls Enter passphrase for RSA key 'smith@client': ******** $ ... time passes... README myfile myfile2  298    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia has a keyword, GoBackground, that does the same thing, accepting the values yes or no  the default :   Tectia GoBackground yes  GoBackground and –f also set up any port forwardings you may have specified on the command line. [9.2.6] The setup occurs after authentication but before back- grounding.  Escaping  7.4.6.8 Recall that the ssh client has an escape sequence feature. [2.3.2] By typing a particu- lar character, normally a tilde  ~ , immediately after a newline or carriage return, you can send special commands to ssh: terminate the connection, suspend the con- nection, and so forth. Table 7-2 summarizes the supported escape sequences. It’s fol- lowed by a list that describes each sequence’s meaning.  If the next character following the escape character isn’t in Table 7-2, then OpenSSH sends the entire  unrecognized  escape sequence to the server verbatim, whereas Tectia discards the escape sequence and sends nothing.

All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    299     “Suspend the connection” puts ssh into the background, suspended, returning control of the terminal to the local shell. To return to ssh, use the appropriate job control command of your shell, typically fg. While suspended, ssh doesn’t run, and if left suspended long enough, the connection may terminate since the client isn’t responding to the server. Also, any forwarded connections are simi- larly blocked while ssh is suspended. [9.2.9]    “Terminate the connection” ends the SSH session immediately. This is most use- ful if you have lost control of the session: for instance, if a shell command on the remote host has hung and become unkillable, or if you tried exiting while a tun- nel  forwarding  is still active. Any X or TCP port forwardings are terminated immediately as well. [9.2.9]    “List all forwarded connections” prints a list of each X forwarding or TCP port forwarding connection currently established. This lists only active instances of forwarding; if forwarding services are available but not currently in use, nothing is listed here.    “Send ssh into the background,” like the “suspend connection” command, reconnects your terminal to the shell that started ssh, but it doesn’t suspend the ssh process. Instead, ssh continues to run. This isn’t ordinarily useful, since the backgrounded ssh process immediately encounters an error.* This escape sequence becomes useful if your ssh session has active, forwarded connections when you log out. Normally in this situation, the client prints a message about waiting for forwarded connections to terminate. The client typically waits  silently  in the foreground for the forwarded connections to close before it exits: you can detect this by using the “list all forwarded connections” escape. While the client is in this state, the “send ssh into the background” escape sequence returns you to the local shell prompt.    “Request rekeying immediately” causes the SSH client and server to generate and use some new internal keys for encryption and integrity. Normally, the client and server agree to rekey automatically at regular intervals. [5.3.4]    “Send the escape character” tells the client to send a real tilde  or whatever the escape character is  to the SSH server as plaintext, not to interpret it as an escape.    “Disable the escape character” prevents further escape sequences from having  any effect, and is therefore irrevocable.    “Open a command line to add or remove a port forwarding” prompts for –L or –R options to create a new local or remote port forwarding, respectively. [9.2] An existing remote forwarding can be canceled using -KR, followed by the target port number.† To obtain a help message, type –h or ?.  * The error occurs as ssh attempts to read input from the now disconnected pseudo-terminal. † Local forwardings cannot be canceled.  300    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     “Switch to line mode” causes characters to be collected by the client and then sent together to the server after a newline has been entered. This allows line-edit- ing features that are available on the client machine to be used, even in situa- tions when similar features are not available on the server machine. Line mode is temporary: after a single line has been sent, the client resumes its normal opera- tion of sending each character to the server as soon as it has been entered.  The rest of the escape sequences are self-explanatory.  Sometimes the default escape character can cause a problem. Suppose you connect by ssh from host A to host B, then from host B to host C, and finally from host C to host D, making a chain of ssh connections  we represent the machines’ shell prompts as A$, B$, C$, and D$ :  While logged onto host D, you press the Return key, then ~ ^Z  tilde followed by Control-Z  to suspend the connection temporarily. Well, you’ve got three ssh con- nections active, so which one gets suspended? The first one does, and this escape sequence brings you back to the host A prompt. Well, what if you want to escape back to host B or C ? There are two methods, one with forethought and one on the spur of the moment.  If you prepare in advance, you may change the escape character for each connection with the configuration keyword EscapeChar, followed by a character:  EscapeChar %  or the –e command-line option, followed again by the desired character  quoted if necessary to protect it from expansion by the shell :  $ ssh -e '%' server.example.com  OpenSSH supports the value none to mean no escape character:  So, going back to our example of hosts A through D, you want a different escape character for each segment of this chain of connections. For example:  A$ ssh B ...   B$ ssh C   ...     C$ ssh D     ...       D$   OpenSSH EscapeChar none  A$ ssh B ...   B$ ssh -e '$' C   ...     C$ ssh -e '%' D     ...       D$  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    301   Now, while logged onto host D, a tilde still brings you back to host A, but a dollar sign brings you back to host B and a percent sign back to host C. The same effect can be achieved with the EscapeChar keyword, but the following table shows that more forethought is required to set up configuration files on three hosts.  OpenSSH  Host A configuration file Host B  EscapeChar ~   Host B configuration file Host C  EscapeChar ^   Host C configuration file Host D  EscapeChar %  Tectia  Host A configuration file B:  EscapeChar ~   Host B configuration file C:  EscapeChar ^   Host C configuration file D:  EscapeChar %  Even if you don’t normally make chains of SSH connections, you might still want to change the escape character. For example, your work might require you to type a lot of tildes for other reasons, and you might accidentally type an escape sequence such as ~.  tilde period  and disconnect your session. Oops!  There’s a second method that requires no forethought: type the escape character multiple times. Typing it twice sends the character literally across the SSH connec- tion. [7.4.6.8] Therefore, you can suspend the second SSH connection by typing two escapes, the third by typing three escapes, and so on. Remember, you must precede your escape characters by pressing the Return key. While logged onto host D, you could escape back to host B, for example, by hitting the Return key, then typing two tildes, and Control-Z.  Proxies and SOCKS  7.4.7 SOCKS is an application-layer network proxying system supported by various SSH implementations. Proxying in general provides a way to connect two networks at the application level, without allowing direct network-level connectivity between them. Figure 7-3 shows a typical SOCKS installation.  The figure shows a private network and the Internet. The gateway machine is con- nected to both, but doesn’t function as a router; there’s no direct IP connectivity between the two networks. If a program running on H wants to make a TCP connec- tion to a server on S, it instead connects to the SOCKS server running on G. Using the SOCKS protocol, H requests a connection to S. The SOCKS server makes a con- nection from G to S on behalf of H and then steps out of the way, passing data back and forth between H and S.  302    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Host H  Private network  SOCKS gateway  G  Internet  Host S  Figure 7-3. A typical SOCKS installation  A general drawback of application-level proxying is lack of transparency: only those programs written with support for the particular proxying scheme have network access. SOCKS, however, isn’t specific to any higher-level protocol such as HTTP or SMTP. It provides general services: makes a TCP connection, pings a host, performs a traceroute, etc. Many of its services match the existing programming boundary between applications and network-services libraries. As a result, on modern com- puter systems employing dynamically linked libraries, it is often possible to extend SOCKS to non-SOCKS-aware applications, such as SSH, by replacing the right libraries with SOCKS-aware ones.  SOCKS comes in two versions, SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. There are two major added features in SOCKS5: authentication and naming support. SOCKS5 supports user authentication so that a proxy can apply access control and user logging to its ser- vice. “Naming support” refers to the fact that in SOCKS4, a proxy client expresses the socket it wants to reach as an  IP address, port  pair. In real-world situations, however, the client will often know only the name, not the address, of the host it wants to reach. Furthermore, it may not be able to resolve that name directly, since being behind a proxy, it is likely to be in a different naming context than the server  e.g., a corporate network with split DNS . With SOCKS5, the client can instead pass a  name,port  pair to the proxy server, leaving the proxy to perform the name lookup where it is mostly likely to succeed.  There are two ways in which SSH clients use SOCKS:    As a normal SOCKS client, as described earlier.   As a SOCKS server,  in conjunction with port forwarding. This allows for dynamic forwarding, by which other SOCKS clients may reach any TCP socket on the other side of an SSH connection, through a single forwarded port.  OpenSSH supports only the second method, while Tectia supports both.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    303   SOCKS in OpenSSH: using DynamicForward  7.4.7.1 Dynamic forwarding in OpenSSH is done using the –D switch or DynamicForward configuration statement:  $ ssh -D1080 server  or:   ~ .ssh config: host server   DynamicForward 1080  As with static  –L  port forwarding, this command causes the SSH client to listen for TCP connections on the given port  here 1080, the standard SOCKS port . Note, however, that there’s no argument specifying a target socket for the forwarding! That’s because this sort of forwarding is completely flexible: each connection to port 1080 can go to a different remote socket, given at connection time via the SOCKS protocol. Set any network client with SOCKS support to use this SSH-forwarded port as its “SOCKS server,” and it will have complete TCP access to the network on the other side of the SSH connection.  Just as with static forwarding, a dynamically forwarded port by default listens only on the loopback address. Use the –g switch to have it listen on all host addresses. This option affects all locally forwarded ports established with this instance of ssh.  Unfortunately, OpenSSH does not have SOCKS client support built in. However, there are a number of packages around for conveniently “socksifying” existing pro- grams on the fly; two such packages are tsocks and runsocks. They both play with the system dynamic linker to replace basic network library calls with SOCKS-aware wrappers, and they are both effective on OpenSSH.  If this sort of linking trick doesn’t work, then you can use a separate program instead. You’ll need a simple utility which makes the connection through your SOCKS proxy, e.g., a socksified version of netcat  nc :  http:  www.securityfocus.com tools 137 http:  netcat.sourceforge.net   Then simply:   OpenSSH  ssh -o ProxyCommand="nc %h %p" ...  SOCKS in Tectia  7.4.7.2 Tectia supports both SOCKS client and server  dynamic-forwarding  features, and both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5. However, it does not support user authentication in the SOCKS5 client.  Tectia SOCKS client. The Tectia SOCKS client feature is controlled with a single param- eter, set with the SocksServer configuration keyword or the SSH_SOCKS_SERVER  304    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   environment variable. The configuration option overrides the environment variable if both are present.  The SocksServer keyword is a string with the following format:  socks:  [user]@gateway[:port] [net1 mask1,net2 mask2,...]  Here, gateway is the machine running the SOCKS server, user is the username you supply for identification to SOCKS, and port is the TCP port for the SOCKS server  by default, 1080 . The net mask entries indicate netblocks that are to be considered local; that is, ssh uses SOCKS only for connections lying outside the given network ranges. The mask is given as the length of the network prefix, not an explicit mask, e.g., 192.168.10.0 24 rather than 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0.  The parts of the string enclosed in square brackets are optional. So, an SSH_SOCKS_ SERVER value can be as simple as this:  socks:  laces.shoes.net  With this value, ssh uses SOCKS for all connections. It connects to a SOCKS server running on laces.shoes.net, port 1080, and it doesn’t supply a username. You’ll prob- ably never want to use an SSH_SOCKS_SERVER setting as simple as this one, which uses the SOCKS server for all ssh connections, even those connecting back to the same machine or to a machine on the same network. A better setup is to use SOCKS only for hosts on the other side of the gateway from you. Here’s a more complete example:  socks:  dan@laces.shoes.net:4321 127.0.0.0 8,192.168.10.0 24  With this value, ssh connects directly to itself via its loopback address  127.0.0.1 , or to hosts on the class C network, 192.168.10.0. It uses SOCKS for all other connections, supplying the username “dan” and looking for the SOCKS server on port 4321.  Tectia SOCKS server  dynamic port forwarding . Tectia also has dynamic port forwarding via SOCKS, as described earlier for the OpenSSH –D option. [7.4.7.1] It works anal- ogously, using this syntax:   Tectia $ ssh -L socks 1080 server  You could then even use a separate ssh command as a SOCKS client of this one, to reach a second SSH server on the far side of the first one:   Tectia $ ssh -o 'SocksServer socks:  localhost ' ...  Forwarding  7.4.8 Port forwarding and X forwarding are covered in Chapter 9 and agent forwarding in Chapter 6. We mention them here only for completeness, since forwarding can be controlled in the client configuration file and on the command line.

All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    305   Encryption Algorithms  7.4.9 When establishing a connection, an SSH client and server have a little conversation about encryption. The server says, “Hello client, here are the encryption algorithms I support.” In return, the client says, “Hi there server, I’d like to choose this particular algorithm, please.” Normally, they reach agreement, and the connection proceeds. If they can’t agree on an encryption algorithm, the connection fails.  Most users let the client and server work things out themselves. But if you like, you may instruct the client to request particular encryption algorithms in its conversa- tion with the server. This is done with the Ciphers keyword followed by a comma- separated list of encryption algorithms of choice:  Ciphers blowfish,3des  or the –c command-line option, either followed by a comma-separated list  OpenSSH  or specified multiple times  Tectia :   OpenSSH $ ssh -c blowfish,3des server.example.com   Tectia $ ssh -c blowfish -c 3des server.example.com  indicating that any of these algorithms is acceptable.  All ciphers acceptable by a server may be specified for the client. [5.3.5] Check the latest SSH documentation for a current list of supported ciphers.  Integrity-Checking  MAC  Algorithms  7.4.10 The –m command-line option lets you select the integrity-checking algorithm, known as the message authentication code  MAC , used by the SSH-2 protocol: [3.8.3]  $ ssh -m hmac-sha1 server.example.com  You can specify multiple algorithms on the command line, either as a comma- separated list  OpenSSH  or with multiple –m options  Tectia :   OpenSSH $ ssh -m hmac-sha1,hmac-md5 server.example.com   Tectia $ ssh -m hmac-sha1 -m hmac-md5 server.example.com  and the SSH server selects one to use. OpenSSH supports the MACs keyword to do the same thing:   OpenSSH MACs hmac-sha1,hmac-md5  306    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   7.4.11 Host Key Types OpenSSH lets you choose host key types you will accept. Provide a comma-separated list of types, from highest to lowest precedence, to the HostKeyAlgorithms keyword. See the ssh_config manpage for the current selection of algorithms.   OpenSSH HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-dss,ssh-rsa  Suppose you are about to SSH to a new server for the first time. Being security con- scious, you have obtained the server’s RSA hostkey through reliable means and placed it in ~ .ssh known-hosts. But when you connect, you find that OpenSSH uses the server’s DSA key instead, and complains about an unknown hostkey. OpenSSH is not smart enough to prefer a key type it has over one it doesn’t—but you can work around this by setting HostKeyAlgorithms to ssh-rsa.  Session Rekeying  7.4.12 The RekeyIntervalSeconds keyword specifies how often  in seconds  the Tectia client performs key exchange with the server to replace the session data-encryption and integrity keys. The default is 3600 seconds  one hour , and a zero value disables rekeying:   Tectia RekeyIntervalSeconds 7200  7.4.13 Authentication In a typical SSH setup, clients try to authenticate by the strongest methods first. If a particular method fails or isn’t set up, the next one is tried, and so on. This default behavior should work fine for most needs.  Nevertheless, your clients may request specific types of authentication if they need to do so. For example, you might want to use public-key authentication only, and if it fails, no other methods should be tried.  7.4.13.1 Requesting an authentication technique OpenSSH clients can request specific authentication methods by keyword. The syn- tax is the same as the server’s in  etc ssh sshd_config, and you can specify all the same authentication methods. PasswordAuthentication, PubKeyAuthentication, and KerberosAuthentication, followed by yes or no:  Examples  [5.4.1]  are   OpenSSH PasswordAuthentication no PubKeyAuthentication yes  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    307   Additionally, you can specify the order in which the client should try these authenti- cation methods, with the PreferredAuthentications keyword:   OpenSSH PreferredAuthentications publickey,hostbased,password  The ssh_config 5  manpage lists the currently supported methods.  For Tectia, the AllowedAuthentications keyword selects one or more authentication techniques. Again, the keyword has the same use here as for the Tectia server: [5.4.1]   Tectia AllowedAuthentications publickey, password  7.4.13.2 The server is the boss When a client specifies an authentication technique, this is just a request, not a requirement. For example, the configuration:  PasswordAuthentication yes  informs the SSH server that you, the client, agree to participate in password authenti- cation. It doesn’t guarantee that you will authenticate by password, just that you are willing to do it if the server agrees. The server makes the decision and might still authenticate you by another method.  For a client to require an authentication technique, it must tell the server that one, and only one, technique is acceptable. To do this, the client must deselect every other authentication technique. For example, to try only password authentication with the server, use OpenSSH’s PreferredAuthentications keyword:  or Tectia’s AllowedAuthentications keyword, which has the same syntax as the server keyword of the same name: [5.4.1]   OpenSSH PreferredAuthentications password   Tectia AllowedAuthentications password  If the server doesn’t support password authentication, however, this connection attempt will fail.  7.4.13.3 Detecting successful authentication Tectia provides two keywords for reporting whether authentication is successful: AuthenticationSuccessMsg and AuthenticationNotify. Each of these causes Tectia cli- ents to print a message after attempting authentication.  AuthenticationSuccessMsg controls the appearance of the message “Authentication successful” after authentication, which is printed on standard error. Values may be yes  the default, to display the message  or no:   Tectia $ ssh server.example.com  308    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Authentication successful. Last login: Sat Jun 24 2000 14:53:28 -0400 ... $ ssh -p221 -o 'AuthenticationSuccessMsg no' server.example.com Last login: Sat Jun 24 2000 14:53:28 -0400 ...  AuthenticationNotify, an undocumented keyword, causes Tectia’s ssh to print a dif- ferent message, this time on standard output. If the authentication is successful, the message is “AUTHENTICATED YES”; otherwise, it’s “AUTHENTICATED NO”. Values may be yes  print the message  or no  the default :  $ ssh -q -o 'AuthenticationNotify yes' server.example.com AUTHENTICATED YES Last login: Thu Jun 24 2004 14:53:35 -0400 ...  The behavior of these two keywords differs in the following ways:    AuthenticationSuccessMsg writes to stderr; AuthenticationNotify writes to std-  out.    The –q command-line option [7.4.17] silences AuthenticationSuccessMsg but not AuthenticationNotify. This makes AuthenticationNotify better for scripting  for example, to find out if an authentication can succeed or not . Notice that exit is used as a remote command so that the shell terminates immediately:  ! bin csh  Tectia  Get the AUTHENTICATION line set line = `ssh -q -o 'AuthenticationNotify yes' server.example.com exit`  Capture the second word set result = `echo $line  awk '{print $2}'` if   $result == "YES"   then   ...  In fact, AuthenticationNotify is used precisely in this manner by Tectia’s scp and sftp, when these programs run ssh in the background to connect to the remote host for file transfers. They wait for the appearance of the “AUTHENTICATED YES” message to know that the connection was successful, and they can now start speaking to the sftp-server.  AuthenticationSuccessMsg provides an additional safety feature: a guarantee that authentication has occurred. Suppose you invoke Tectia’s ssh and are prompted for your passphrase:   Tectia $ ssh server.example.com Passphrase for key "mykey": ********  You then see, to your surprise, a second passphrase prompt:  Passphrase for key "mykey":  You might conclude that you mistyped your passphrase the first time, and so you type it again. But what if the second prompt came not from your ssh client, but from  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    309   the server, which has been cracked by an evil intruder? Your passphrase has just been stolen! To counteract this potential threat, ssh prints “Authentication successful” after authentication, so the previous session actually looks like this:   Tectia $ ssh server.example.com Passphrase for key "mykey": ******** Authentication successful. Passphrase for key "mykey":  Suspicious!  The second passphrase prompt is now revealed as a fraud.  7.4.13.4 Using ssh-keysign for hostbased authentication Earlier we described how hostbased authentication requires a privileged program that provides SSH credentials to user processes. [3.4.3.6] In OpenSSH, this program is ssh-keysign. It must be installed setuid root  or any account that can read the cli- ent hostkey .  To allow a client system to perform hostbased authentication, the system administra- tor must set the EnableSSHKeysign keyword in  etc ssh ssh_config:   ssh_config EnableSSHKeysign yes  Most options in ssh_config are for the ssh program itself, but this one option is read by ssh-keysign. Hostbased authentication relies critically on the integrity of the client host and on other administrative requirements, such as correspondence of account names across hosts. It is crucial that it not be used unless these requirements are met; this option is to make sure that it is not enabled unless the system administrator con- sciously chooses to do so.  7.4.14 Data Compression SSH connections may be compressed. That is, data sent over an SSH connection may be compressed automatically before it is encrypted and sent, and automatically uncompressed after it is received and decrypted. If you’re running SSH software on fast, modern processors, compression is generally a win. However, it also depends on your network speed, and whether the data you’re transferring is already compressed or not  say, a large compressed tar file .  To enable compression for a single session, use command-line options. Unfortu- nately, the implementations have incompatible syntax. For OpenSSH, compression is disabled by default, and the –C command-line option turns it on:   OpenSSH: turn compression ON $ ssh -C server.example.com $ scp -C myfile server.example.com:  310    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   For Tectia, however, –C means the opposite, turning compression off:   Tectia: turn compression OFF $ ssh -C server.example.com  and +C turns it on:   Tectia: turn compression ON $ ssh +C server.example.com   There is no compression option for Tectia’s scp.  To enable or disable compression for all sessions, use the Compression keyword, given a value of yes or no  the default :  Compression yes  7.4.15 Program Locations The auxiliary Tectia program ssh-signer is normally located in Tectia’s installation directory, along with the other Tectia binaries. [3.4.3.6] You can change this loca- tion with the undocumented keyword SshSignerPath:   Tectia SshSignerPath  usr alternative bin ssh-signer2  If you use this keyword, be sure to set it to the fully qualified path of the program. If you use a relative path, hostbased authentication works only for users who have ssh- signer2 in their search path, and cron jobs fail without ssh-signer2 in their path.  Subsystems  7.4.16 Subsystems are predefined commands supported by an SSH server. [5.8] Each installed server can implement different subsystems, so check with the system administrator of the server machine for a list.*  The –s option of ssh invokes a subsystem on a remote machine. For example, if the SSH server running on server.example.com has a “backups” subsystem defined, you run it as:  $ ssh server.example.com -s backups  OpenSSH uses the remote command as the subsystem name: this must be specified last on the ssh command line. In contrast, Tectia obtains the subsystem name from the command-line argument that immediately follows the –s option. Therefore, our previous example works in both cases, so we highly recommend this syntax. Other orderings of the command line are possible for specific implementations:   OpenSSH $ ssh -s server.example.com backups   Tectia $ ssh -s backups server.example.com  * Or examine the remote machine’s server configuration file yourself for lines beginning with subsystem.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.4 Client Configuration in Depth    311   Command-line arguments cannot be used with subsystems: neither OpenSSH nor Tectia provides any mechanism for passing them from client to server. If any extra arguments are given on the ssh command line, OpenSSH  mis interprets them as part of the subsystem name:   OpenSSH $ ssh server.example.com -s backups  home Request for subsystem 'backups  home' failed on channel 0  whereas Tectia simply forbids extra command-line arguments if –s is used:   Tectia $ ssh server.example.com -s backups  home ssh: FATAL: No command allowed with subsystem.  Logging and Debugging  7.4.17 Earlier in the chapter, we introduced the –v command-line option which causes SSH clients to print verbose debugging messages. [7.3] Verbose mode works for ssh and scp, e.g.:  $ ssh -v server.example.com  OpenSSH also has the LogLevel keyword, which takes the following levels as an argu- ment: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, and DEBUG3  in order of increasing verbosity . The value DEBUG is equivalent to DEBUG1, and:   OpenSSH $ ssh -o LogLevel=DEBUG  is equivalent to ssh –v.   Tectia VerboseMode yes  Verbose mode can also be turned on for Tectia with the  surprise!  VerboseMode keyword:  If you ever encounter problems or strange behavior from SSH, your first instinct should be to turn on verbose mode.  Tectia’s ssh has multiple levels of debug messages; verbose mode corresponds to level 2. You can specify greater or less debugging with the –d command-line option, followed by an integer from 0 to 99:   Tectia $ ssh -d0 $ ssh -d1 $ ssh -d2 $ ssh -d3 $ ssh -d  No debugging messages Just a little debugging Same as –v A little more detailed And so on...  312    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Tectia’s –d option may also use the same module-based syntax as serverdebugging: [5.9]  for   Tectia $ ssh -d Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2 server.example.com  Tectia’s scp also supports this level of debugging, but the option is –D instead of –d since scp –d is already used to mean something else:    Tectia $ scp -D Ssh2AuthPasswdServer=2 myfile server.example.com  To disable all debug messages, use –q:  $ ssh -q server.example.com  or specify it with the LogLevel  OpenSSH  or QuietMode  Tectia  keyword:   OpenSSH LogLevel QUIET   Tectia QuietMode yes  $ ssh -V  Finally, to print the program version number, use –V:  7.4.18 Random Seeds Tectia lets you change the location of your random seed file, which is ~ .ssh2  random_seed by default: [5.3.1.2]   Tectia RandomSeedFile  u smith .ssh2 new_seed  Secure Copy with scp  7.5 The secure copy program, scp, obeys keywords in your client configuration file just as ssh does. In addition, scp provides other features and options that we’ll cover in this section. Remember that scp supports several options for logging and debugging, so you can watch what’s going on when it runs. [7.3]  Full Syntax of scp  7.5.1 So far, we’ve described the syntax of scp only in general: [2.2.1]  scp name-of-source name-of-destination  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.5 Secure Copy with scp    313   Each of the two names, or path specifications, on the command line represents files or directories in the following manner  it is fairly consistent with the behavior of Unix cp or rcp :    If name-of-source is a file, name-of-destination may be a file  existing or not  or a directory  which must exist . In other words, a single file may be copied to another file or into a directory.    If name-of-source is two or more files, one or more directories, or a combina- tion, name-of-destination must be an existing directory into which the copy takes place.* In other words, multiple files and directories may be copied only into a directory.  Both name-of-source and name-of-destination may have the following form from left to right:    The username of the account containing the file or directory, followed by @. This part is optional, and if omitted, the value is the username of the user invok- ing scp.    The hostname of the host containing the file or directory, followed by a colon. This part is optional, if the path is present, and the username isn’t; if omitted, the value is localhost. Tectia permits an optional TCP port number for the SSH connection to be inserted between the hostname and the colon, preceded by a hash sign.    The directory path to the file or directory.  Optional if the hostname is present.  Relative pathnames are assumed relative to the default directory, which is the current directory  for local paths  or the user’s home directory  for remote paths . If omitted entirely, the path is assumed to be the default directory.  Although each field is optional, you can’t omit them all at the same time, yielding the empty string. Either the hostname     or the directory path     must be present. Some examples:  MyFile  MyDirectory  .  period   The file . MyFile on localhost  The directory . MyDirectory on localhost  The current directory on localhost  server.example.com:  The directory ~username on server.example.com  * We say “must,” but technically you could specify a file as a destination in some cases. However, this behavior is probably not what you want. As your multiple files get copied into a single destination file, each is over- written by the next!  314    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   server.example.com  A local file named “server.example.com”  Oops: did you forget the trailing colon? This is a common mistake.   server.example.com:MyFile  The file MyFile in the remote user’s home directory on server.example.com  bob@server.example.com:  The directory ~bob on server.example.com  bob@server.example.com  bob@server.example.com:MyFile  The file ~bob MyFile on server.example.com  server.example.com:dir MyFile  A local file named “bob@server.example.com”  oops; forgot the trailing colon again   The file dir MyFile in the remote user’s home directory on server.example.com  server.example.com: dir MyFile  The file  dir MyFile on server.example.com  note the absolute path   bob@server.example.com:dir MyFile  The file ~bob dir MyFile on server.example.com  bob@server.example.com: dir MyFile  The file  dir MyFile on server.example.com  although you authenticate as bob, the path is absolute   server.example.com2000:  The remote user’s home directory on server.example.com, via TCP port 2000  Tectia only   Here are a few complete examples:  A local copy just like cp $ scp myfile myfile2 Copy . myfile to ~bob on host1 $ scp myfile bob@host1: Copy ~bob myfile on host1 to . myfile $ scp bob@host1:myfile . Copy file1 from host1 to file2 on host2 $ scp host1:file1 host2:file2 $ scp bob@host1:file1 jen@host2:file2  Same as above, but copying from bob's                                                                               to jen's account  Table 7-3 summarizes the syntax of an scp path.

Default for local host 22 Current  invoking  directory  Default for remote host 22 Username’s remote home directory  Handling of Wildcards  7.5.2 scp for OpenSSH has no special support for wildcards in filenames. It simply lets the shell expand them:  $ scp *.txt server.example.com:  Watch out for wildcards in remote file specifications, as they are evaluated on the local machine, not the remote. For example, this attempt is likely to fail:  $ scp server.example.com:*.txt .  Bad idea!  The Unix shell attempts to expand the wildcard before scp is invoked, but the cur- rent directory contains no filename matching “server.example.com:*.txt”. The C shell and its derivatives will report “no match” and will not execute scp. Bourne-style shells, noticing no match in the current directory, will pass the unexpanded wild- card to scp, and the copy may succeed as planned, but this coincidental behavior shouldn’t be relied on. Always escape your wildcards so that they are explicitly ignored by the shell and are passed to scp:  $ scp server.example.com:\*.txt .  Tectia’s scp does its own regular expression matching after shell-wildcard expansion is complete. The sshregex manpage for Tectia  see Appendix B  describes the sup- ported operators. Even so, escape your wildcard characters if you want your local shell to leave them alone.  Recursive Copy of Directories  7.5.3 Sometimes you want to copy not just a single file, but a directory hierarchy. In this case, use the –r option, which stands for recursive. For example, to securely copy the directory  usr local bin and all its files and subdirectories to another machine:  $ scp -r  usr local bin server.example.com:  If you forget the –r option when copying directories, scp complains:  $ scp  usr local bin server.example.com:  usr local bin: not a regular file  Although scp can copy directories, it isn’t necessarily the best method. If your direc- tory contains hard links or soft links, they won’t be duplicated. Links are copied as plain files  the link targets . Other types of special files, such as named pipes, also  316    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   aren’t copied correctly.* A better solution is to use tar, which handles special files correctly, and send it to the remote machine to be untarred, via SSH:  $ tar cf -  usr local bin  ssh server.example.com tar xf -  or rsync, tunneled through SSH:  $ rsync -e ssh  usr local bin server.example.com:  Preserving Permissions  7.5.4 When scp copies files, the destination files are created with certain file attributes. By default, the file permissions adhere to a umask on the destination host, and the mod- ification and last access times will be the time of the copy. Alternatively, you can tell scp to duplicate the permissions and timestamps of the original files. The –p option accomplishes this:  $ scp -p myfile server.example.com:  For example, if you transfer your entire home directory to a remote machine, you probably want to keep the file attributes the same as the original:  $ scp -rp $HOME server.example.com:myhome   Again, scp does not duplicate special files and links, so consider tar or rsync -a instead:  $ rsync -a -e ssh  usr local bin server.example.com:  Automatic Removal of Original File  7.5.5 After copying a file, Tectia’s scp can optionally remove the original if desired. The –u command-line option specifies this:   Tectia $ scp myfile server.example.com: $ ls myfile myfile $ scp -u myfile server.example.com: $ ls myfile myfile: No such file or directory   Tectia $ alias smv='scp -u'  If you’ve ever wanted a “secure move” command in addition to secure copy, you can define one in terms of scp –u:  * These limitations also are true when copying single files, but at least you see the erroneous result quickly.  With directories, you can copy a hierarchy incorrectly and not notice.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.5 Secure Copy with scp    317   Safety Features  7.5.6 Tectia’s scp has several features to protect you from running dangerous commands.  7.5.6.1 Directory conﬁrmation Suppose you want to copy a local file, myfile, to a remote directory. You type:  $ scp myfile server.example.com:mydir $ rm myfile  Then you connect to server.example.com and find, to your horror, that mydir was a file, not a directory, and you just overwrote it! Tectia’s –d option prevents this trag- edy. If the destination isn’t a directory, scp complains and exits without copying the file:   Tectia $ scp -d myfile server.example.com:mydir scp: warning: Destination  example.com:mydir  is not a directory.  This option is necessary only if you are copying a single file. If you are copying multi- ple files or a directory, all the scp implementations check by default that the remote destination is a directory.*  7.5.6.2 No-execute mode Another safety feature of Tectia’s scp is the –n option, which instructs the program to describe its actions but not perform any copying. This is useful for verifying the behavior of scp before executing a potentially risky command.   Tectia $ scp -n myfile server.example.com: Not transferring myfile -> server.example.com:. myfile   1k   7.5.6.3 Overwriting existing ﬁles Tectia’s scp will refuse to overwrite existing files if you desire. The –I or --interactive option will prompt you before overwriting a destination file:   Tectia $ scp -I myfile server.example.com: Overwrite destination file '. myfile' with ' home smith myfile'  yes yes to all no no to all abort  [y Y n N a]:n  As an alternative, if you know in advance whether you’ll want to overwrite existing files, use the --overwrite option  the default is no :   Tectia $ scp --overwrite yes myfile server.example.com:    Always overwrite  * There’s one degenerate case. If your copy occurs on a single machine, e.g., scp *.c mydir, the scp client doesn’t  necessarily check that mydir is a directory.  318    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Batch Mode  7.5.7 If you’re using scp in scripts with passwordless authentication [11.1], you might want to suppress all prompting of the user. That’s what the –B option is for, which enables batch mode. When present, this option suppresses all interaction with the user. [7.4.6.4]  $ scp -B myfile server.example.com:  User Identity  7.5.8 OpenSSH provides the –i option for scp, as it does for ssh, to specify a particular identity file for authentication. [7.4.2]   OpenSSH $ scp -i my_favorite_key myfile server.example.com:  Tectia has no option like this, but you can get around this limitation with –o: [7.1.2.1]   Tectia $ scp -o "IdentityFile my_identity_file" myfile server.example.com:  SSH Protocol Settings  7.5.9 You can downgrade scp to use the SSH-1 protocol with the -1 option, if you are feel- ing insecure:  $ scp -1 myfile server.example.com:  or redundantly specify the SSH-2 protocol, which is the default anyway:   OpenSSH $ scp -2 myfile server.example.com:  TCP IP Settings  7.5.10 You can specify the remote TCP port contacted by scp with the –P option  OpenSSH :  or by appending a hash mark and port number to the file specification  Tectia :   OpenSSH $ scp -P 23456 myfile server.example.com:   Tectia $ scp myfile server.example.com23456:  Both OpenSSH and Tectia can require the use of IP Version 4 or 6, as ssh does, with the -4 and -6 options. [7.4.5.6]  Encryption Algorithms  7.5.11 You can set the encryption cipher for scp with the –c option, exactly as for ssh. [7.4.9]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.5 Secure Copy with scp    319   Controlling Bandwidth  7.5.12 The –l  lowercase L  option of OpenSSH’s scp command will limit the bandwidth of the connection, in case you want to avoid saturating a slower network.   OpenSSH $ scp -l 1000 myfile server.example.com:    Limit bandwidth to 1000 kilobits per second  Tectia’s scp command can limit the maximum number of concurrent requests it will issue, with the –N option:   Tectia $ scp -r -N 5 mydirectory server.example.com: Limit to five concurrent requests in this recursive        directory transfer  Finally, Tectia’s –b option controls the buffer size for the file transfer; the default is 32K:   Tectia $ scp -b 65536 myfile server.example.com: Set buffer size to 64K  7.5.13 Data Compression OpenSSH’s scp command can compress the data before sending it, with the –C option, to speed up transfers: [7.4.14]   OpenSSH $ scp -C myfile server.example.com:  Tectia does not provide a similar option, but you can get around this and enable compression with –o: [7.1.2.1]  $ scp -o "Compression yes" myfile server.example.com:  File Conversion  7.5.14 Tectia’s scp has several options for changing the files in transit. It can change the des- tination filenames to all lowercase, with the --force-lower-case option:   Tectia $ scp --force-lower-case MyFile server.example.com:  The destination file on server.example.com will be named myfile rather than MyFile.  Another Tectia transformation involves the treatment of lines in a text file. scp nor- mally transfers files literally, as binary data. You can choose to treat the files spe- cially as text files—that is, lines of ASCII characters terminated by carriage returns and or linefeeds—with the –a option. Unix, DOS, and Macintosh operating systems use different standards for terminating lines of text, and scp can convert between these standards.   Tectia $ scp -a my_text_file server.example.com:  320    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The above command assumes that the SSH client and server can accurately commu- nicate and agree upon the text file standards. If not, you can use a more advanced syntax for –a that specifies the line terminators as unix, dos, or mac. This is done by placing src:  for the source machine  and dst:  for the destination machine  after the –a option. Some examples:   Tectia $ scp -asrc:unix -adst:dos myfile server.example.com:  Convert from Unix to DOS Windows        format $ scp -asrc:dos -adst:mac myfile server.example.com:   Convert from DOS Windows to        Macintosh format $ scp -asrc:mac -adst:unix myfile server.example.com:  Convert from Macintosh to Unix        format  7.5.15 Optimizations Tectia’s scp does a few optimizations to avoid transferring unnecessary files and data. Before coping a file, scp compares the file sizes. If they are different, the copy com- mences, but if they are the same, scp computes an MD5 checksum of the source and destination file. If the checksums are equal, the files are assumed to be identical and no copy takes place, and you’ll see a message like this:  myfile: complete md5 match -> transfer skipped  If you always want your files copied, even if they are identical  i.e., have equal check- sums , you can disable the MD5 test with the --checksum option, providing the value no:   Tectia $ scp --checksum no myfile server.example.com:   Don’t compute checksums for files  Tectia’s scp performs similar checking on individual data blocks to determine whether to transfer them or not. You can control this with the –W or --whole-file options, providing the value yes or no:   Tectia $ scp --whole-file yes myfile server.example.com:    Always transfer whole files  Statistics Display  7.5.16 As scp copies files, it prints information about its progress, including statistics about the file transfer. You can control this information with various options.  OpenSSH simply lets you suppress the statistics with its –q option:  Tectia can likewise suppress statistics with the –Q option  Tectia .   OpenSSH $ scp -q myfile server.example.com:   Tectia $ scp -Q myfile server.example.com:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  7.5 Secure Copy with scp    321   but permits more control with the --statistics option:   Tectia $ scp --statistics no myfile server.example.com:    Same as -Q option  $ scp --statistics simple myfile server.example.com:    Minimal statistics  home smith myfile     4B     4B s  TOC: 00:00:01  $ scp --statistics yes myfile server.example.com:     Full statistics myfile                                         4B     4B s  TOC: 00:00:01  100%  Locating the ssh Executable  7.5.17 To copy files securely, scp invokes ssh internally. Therefore, scp needs to know where the ssh executable resides on disk. Normally, the path to ssh is made known to scp at compile time  by the compile-time flag --prefix , but you can specify the path man- ually if you like. [4.3.5.1] For instance, you can test a new version of ssh with an old version of scp. The command-line option –S specifies the path:  $ scp -S  usr alternative bin ssh myfile server.example.com:  7.5.18 Getting Help Both OpenSSH and Tectia scp will print a usage message briefly describing all its options:  You can get the same effect if you omit all arguments  OpenSSH  or use –h  Tectia . Tectia will also print its version number on request:  $ scp --help   Tectia $ scp --version $ scp -V  For Internal Use Only  7.5.19 scp for OpenSSH has two undocumented options, –t and –f, for internal use. Most likely you will never need to use them explicitly. They inform scp of the direction of the copy: from the local to the remote machine, or from remote to local. The –t option means copying to a remote machine and –f means copying from a remote machine.  Whenever you invoke scp, it invisibly runs a second scp process on the remote host that includes either –t or –f on its command line. You can see this if you run scp in verbose mode. If copying from the local to the remote machine, you see:  $ scp -v myfile server.example.com: Executing: host server.example.com, ..., command scp -v -t . ...  322    Chapter 7: Advanced Client Use  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   On the other hand, if you copy from the remote to the local machine, you see:  $ scp -v server.example.com:myfile . Executing: host server.example.com, ..., command scp -v -f . ...  Again, it’s likely you’ll never use these options, but they’re useful to know when reading scp’s output in verbose mode.  Further Conﬁguration  7.5.20 You can set any client configuration keywords for scp using the –o option, exactly as for ssh. Additionally, OpenSSH lets you specify an alternative configuration file with –F. [7.1.2.1]  Secure, Interactive Copy with sftp  7.6 The sftp client is an alternative to scp, though under the hood it does mostly the same thing: it copies files between SSH client and server machines securely. The main difference is that sftp is interactive, with an interface much like the old FTP programs. [2.7.1]  Interactive Commands  7.6.1 To get started, run sftp with a remote hostname:  $ ftp server.example.com or username and hostname:  $ sftp smith@server.example.com  You’ll get a prompt:  sftp>  and now may type commands to transfer files between your local and remote machine. For example:  sftp> cd remote_directory sftp> ls sftp> get remotefile sftp> get remotefile newname sftp> put localfile sftp> put localfile othername Same as above, but the remote file will be renamed as ”othername” sftp> quit  Change to a particular remote directory List the names of available files Download the file “remotefile” Same as above, but the local file will be renamed as “newname” Upload the file “localfile”  Quit sftp  The basic use of sftp will feel familiar to anyone who’s used an FTP program. Use the cd command to move around the remote filesystem  or lcd for the local filesystem , ls to list the available remote files, and the get and put commands to download and  7.6 Secure, Interactive Copy with sftp    323  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Command-Line Options  7.6.2 Virtually all command-line options available to scp will work for sftp. [7.5]  Summary  7.7 SSH clients are highly configurable through environment variables, command-line options, and keywords in configuration files. Remember that command-line options have the highest precedence, followed by your local client configuration file, and finally the global client configuration file.  Client configuration files consist of sections that apply to individual hosts or groups of hosts. When you run an SSH client, remember that multiple sections can apply to it, according to the precedence rules we covered. If the same keyword is set multiple times, the earliest  OpenSSH  or latest  Tectia  value is the winner.  When experimenting with client configuration, remember verbose mode. If you experience unusual SSH behavior, your first instinct should be to add the –v option and run the client again, watching the debug output for clues.

All rights reserved.  7.7 Summary    325   CHAPTER 8 Chapter 8 Per-Account Server Conﬁguration  We’ve seen two techniques for controlling the SSH server’s behavior globally: compile-time configuration  Chapter 4  and serverwide configuration  Chapter 5 . These techniques affect all incoming SSH connections to a given server machine. Now it’s time to introduce a third, finer-grained method of server control: per- account configuration.  As the name implies, per-account configuration controls the SSH server differently for each user account on the server machine. For example, a user account sandy can accept incoming SSH connections from any machine on the Internet, while rick per- mits connections only from the domain verysafe.com, and fraidycat refuses key- based connections. Each user configures his own account, using the facilities highlighted in Figure 8-1, without needing special privileges or assistance from the system administrator.  We have already seen a simple type of per-account configuration. A user may place a public key into her authorization file, instructing the SSH server to permit logins to her account by public-key authentication. But per-account configuration can go fur- ther, becoming a powerful tool for access control and playing some fun tricks with your account. Accepting or rejecting connections by particular keys or hosts is just the beginning. For instance, you can make an incoming SSH connection run a pro- gram of your choice, instead of the client’s choice. This is called a forced command, and we’ll cover quite a few interesting applications.  Per-account configuration may control only incoming SSH connections to your account. If you’re interested in configuring outgoing SSH connections by running SSH clients, refer to Chapter 7.  Limits of This Technique  8.1 Per-account configuration can do many interesting things, but it has some restric- tions that we will discuss:  326  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Configuration types  Configuration types  SSH Client  SSH Server  Command-line  options  Environment  variables  User’s client  configuration file  Global client  configuration file  Compile-time  flags  Key-related  files  Known hosts databases  Command-line  options  Custom session  startup  Server-side  configuration file  Server-side  authorization files  Compile-time  flags  Target account’s authorization files  TCP-wrappers  files  Kerberos  configuration files  PAM files  Figure 8-1. Per-account configuration  highlighted parts     It can’t defeat security measures put in place by compile-time or serverwide con-  figuration.  Thank goodness.     It is most flexible and secure if you use public-key authentication. Hostbased  and password authentication provide a much narrower range of options.  Overriding Serverwide Settings  8.1.1 SSH settings in a user’s account may only restrict the authentication of incoming connections. They can’t enable any SSH features that have been turned off more glo- bally, and they can’t permit a forbidden user or host to authenticate. For example, if your SSH server rejects all connections from the domain evil.org, you can’t override this restriction within your account by per-account configuration.*  * There is one exception to this rule: hostbased authentication. A user’s ~ .shosts file may override a restriction  placed by the system administrator in  etc shosts.equiv. [8.3]  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.1 Limits of This Technique    327   This limitation makes sense. No end-user tool should be able to violate a server secu- rity policy. However, end users should be  and are  allowed to restrict incoming con- nections to their accounts.  A few features of the server may be overridden by per-account configuration. The most notable one is the server’s idle timeout, which may be extended beyond the serverwide setting. But such features can’t coerce the server to accept a connection it has been globally configured to reject.  If you are an end user, and per-account configuration doesn’t provide enough flexi- bility, you can run your own instance of the SSH server, which you may configure to your heart’s content. [5.1.2] Be cautious, though, since this is seldom the right thing to do. The restrictions you’re trying to circumvent are part of the security policy defined for the machine by its administrators, and you shouldn’t run a program that flouts this policy just because you can. If the machine in question is under your administrative control, simply configure the main SSH server as you wish. If not, then installing and running your own sshd might violate your usage agreement and  or certainly annoy your sysadmin. And that’s never a wise thing to do.  Authentication Issues  8.1.2 To make the best use of per-account configuration, use public-key authentication. Password authentication is too limited, since the only way to control access is with the password itself. Hostbased authentication permits a small amount of flexibility, but not nearly as much as public-key authentication.  If you’re still stuck in the password-authentication dark ages, let this be another rea- son to switch to public keys. Even though passwords and public-key passphrases might seem similar  you type a secret word, and voilà, you’re logged in , public keys are far more flexible for permitting or denying access to your account. Read on and learn how.  Public-Key-Based Conﬁguration  8.2 To set up public-key authentication in your account on an SSH server machine, you create an authorization file,  OpenSSH  or authorization  Tectia , and list the keys that provide access to your account. [2.4] Well, we’ve been keeping a secret. Your authorization file can contain not only keys, but also other keywords or options to control the SSH server in powerful ways. We will discuss:  typically called authorized_keys    The full format of an authorization file   Forced commands for limiting the set of programs that the client may invoke on  the server    Restricting incoming connections from particular hosts  328    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Setting environment variables for remote programs   Setting an idle timeout so that clients will be forcibly disconnected if they aren’t  sending data    Disabling or placing limits on certain features of the incoming SSH connection,  such as port forwarding and tty allocation  As we demonstrate how to modify your authorization file, remember that the file is consulted by the SSH server only at authentication time. Therefore, if you change your authorization file, only new connections will use the new information. Any existing connections are already authenticated and won’t be affected by the change.  Also remember that an incoming connection request won’t reach your authorization file if the SSH server rejects it for other reasons, namely, failing to satisfy the server- wide configuration. If a change to your authorization file doesn’t seem to be having an effect, make sure it doesn’t conflict with a  more powerful  serverwide configura- tion setting.  OpenSSH Authorization Files  8.2.1 Your OpenSSH authorization file, ~ .ssh authorized_keys, is a secure doorway into your account via SSH. Each line of the file contains a public key and means the fol- lowing: “I give permission for SSH clients to access my account, in a particular way, using this key as authentication.” Notice the words “in a particular way.” Until now, public keys have provided unlimited access to an account. Now we’ll see the rest of the story.  Each line may contain, in order:  1. A set of authorization options for the key  optional  2. A string indicating the key type: ssh-dss for a DSA key, or ssh-rsa for an RSA  key  required   3. The public key, represented as a long string  required  4. A descriptive comment  optional ; this can be any text, such as “Bob’s public  key” or “My home PC using SecureCRT 3.1”  Here’s an example:  from="192.168.10.1" ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MA... My OpenSSH key  It contains authorization options  from="192.168.10.1" , the key type  ssh-dss , the public key itself  abbreviated here with an ellipsis , and the final comment  “My OpenSSH key” .  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    329   Public keys are generated by ssh-keygen in .pub files, you may recall, and you typi- cally insert them into authorized_keys by copying. [2.4.3] Options, however, are usu- ally typed into authorized_keys with a text editor.*  An option may take two forms. It may be a keyword, such as:   OpenSSH: Turn off port forwarding no-port-forwarding  or it may be a keyword followed by an equals sign and a value, such as:   OpenSSH: Allow connections only from myhost from=myhost  Multiple options may be given together, separated by commas, with no whitespace between the options:   OpenSSH no-port-forwarding,from=myhost  If you mistakenly include whitespace:   THIS IS ILLEGAL: whitespace between the options no-port-forwarding, from=myhost  your connection by this key won’t work properly. If you connect with debugging turned on  ssh -v , you will see a “bad options” message from the SSH server.  Many SSH users aren’t aware of options or neglect to use them. This is a pity because options provide extra security and convenience. The more you know about the cli- ents that access your account, the more options you can use to control that access.  Tectia Authorization Files  8.2.2 A Tectia authorization file, typically found in ~ .ssh2 authorization,† has a different format than OpenSSH’s. Instead of public keys, it contains keywords and values, much like other SSH configuration files we’ve seen. Each line of the file contains one keyword followed by its value. The most commonly used keywords are Key and Options.  Public keys are indicated using the Key keyword. Key is followed by whitespace, and then the name of a file containing a public key. Relative filenames refer to files in ~ .ssh2. For example:   Tectia Key myself.pub  * When editing authorized_keys, be sure to use a text editor capable of handling long lines. The public key may be several hundred characters long. Some text editors can’t display long lines, won’t edit them properly, automatically insert line breaks, or wreak other sorts of havoc upon your nice public keys.  Aaargh. Don’t get us started talking about brain-damaged text editors.  Use a modern editor, and turn off automatic line breaking. We use GNU Emacs.  † The name can be changed with the keyword AuthorizationFile in the serverwide configuration file. [5.3.1.6]  330    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   that an SSH-2 public key is contained in ~ .ssh2 myself.pub. Your means authorization file must contain at least one Key line for public-key authentication to occur.  Each Key line may optionally be followed immediately by an Options keyword and its value, which is a comma-separated list of options:   Tectia Key myself.pub Options no-port-forwarding, no-x11-forwarding, command="mycommand"  One common option is command, which specifies a forced command, i.e., a command to be executed whenever the key immediately above is used for access. We discuss forced commands later in great detail. [8.2.3] For now, all you need to know is this: a forced command begins with the keyword Options followed by command and its quoted value, a shell command line. For example:   Tectia Key somekey.pub Options command=" bin echo All logins are disabled"  Remember that an Options line by itself is an error. The following examples are illegal:   Tectia  THIS IS ILLEGAL: no Key line Options command=" bin echo This line is bad."  THIS IS ILLEGAL: no Key line precedes the second Options Key somekey.pub Options command=" bin echo All logins are disabled" Options command=" bin echo This line is bad."  Tectia PGP key authentication  8.2.2.1 Tectia supports authentication by PGP key. [6.5] Your authorization file may also include PgpPublicKeyFile, PgpKeyName, PgpKeyFingerprint, and PgpKeyId lines. An Options line may follow PgpKeyName, PgpKeyFingerprint, or PgpKeyId, just as it may follow Key.   Tectia PgpKeyName my-key Options command=" bin echo PGP authentication was detected"  Forced Commands  8.2.3 Ordinarily, an SSH connection invokes a remote command chosen by the client:   Invoke a remote login shell $ ssh server.example.com  Invoke a remote directory listing $ ssh server.example.com  bin ls  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    331   A forced command transfers this control from the client to the server. Instead of the client deciding which command will run, the owner of the server account decides. In Figure 8-2, the client has requested the command  bin ls, but the server-side forced command runs  bin who instead.  Client machine  SSH Client  run  bin ls via key X  output of  bin who instead  Server machine  SSH Server  . . . . forced command for key X =  bin who . .  authorization file  Figure 8-2. Forced command substituting  bin who for  bin ls  Forced commands can be quite useful. Suppose you want to give your assistant access to your account, but only to read your email. You can associate a forced com- mand with your assistant’s SSH key to run only your email program and nothing else.  In OpenSSH, a forced command may be specified in authorized_keys with the com- mand option preceding the desired key. For example, to run the email program pine whenever your assistant connects:   OpenSSH command=" usr bin pine" ...secretary's public key...  In Tectia, a forced command appears on the line immediately following the desired Key, using the command option. The previous example would be represented like so:   Tectia Key secretary.pub Options command " usr bin pine"  You may associate, at most, one forced command with a given key. To associate multiple commands with a key, put them into a script on the remote machine and run the script as the forced command.  We will demonstrate this. [8.2.3.3]   332    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Security issues  8.2.3.1 Before we begin in-depth examples of forced commands, let’s discuss security. At first glance, a forced command seems at least as secure as a “normal” SSH connec- tion that invokes a shell. This is because a shell can invoke any program, while a forced command can invoke only one program, the forced command itself. If a forced command is  usr bin pine, only  usr bin pine can be invoked.  Nevertheless, there’s a caveat. A forced command, carelessly used, may lull you into a sense of false security, believing that you have limited the client’s capabilities when you haven’t. This occurs if the forced command unintentionally permits a shell escape, i.e., a way to invoke a shell from within the forced command. Using a shell escape, a client can invoke any program available to a shell. Many Unix programs have shell escapes, such as text editors  vi, Emacs , pagers  more, less , programs that invoke pagers  man , news readers  rn , mail readers  such as Pine in the previous example! , and debuggers  gdb . Interactive programs are the most common culprits, but even noninteractive commands may run shell commands  find, xargs, etc. .  When you define a forced command, you probably don’t want its key used for arbi- trary shell commands. Therefore, we propose the following safety rules for deciding whether a program is appropriate as a forced command:    Avoid programs that have shell escapes. Read their documentation carefully. If    Avoid compilers, interpreters, or other programs that let the user generate and  you still aren’t sure, get help.  run arbitrary executable code.    Treat very carefully any program that creates or deletes files on disk in user- specified locations. This includes not only applications  word processors, graph- ics programs, etc. , but also command-line utilities that move or copy files  cp, mv, rm, scp, ftp, etc. .    Avoid programs with their setuid or setgid bits set, particularly setuid root.   If using a script as a forced command, follow traditional rules of safe script writ- ing. Within the script, limit the search path to relevant directories  omitting “.” , invoke all programs by absolute path, don’t blindly execute user-supplied strings as commands, and don’t make the script setuid anything.* And again, don’t invoke any program that has a shell escape.    Consider using a restricted shell to limit what the incoming client can do. For example, the restricted shell  usr lib rsh  not to be confused with the r-command also called “rsh”  can limit the remote directories the client can enter.    Associate the forced command with a separate, dedicated SSH key, not the one used for your logins, so that you can conveniently disable the key without affect- ing your login capability.  * Modern Unix implementations often ignore the setuid bit on scripts for security reasons.

All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    333     Disable unnecessary SSH features using other options we cover later. Under OpenSSH, you may disable port forwarding with no-port-forwarding, X for- warding with no-x11-forwarding, agent forwarding with no-agent-forwarding, and tty allocation using no-pty.  Any program may be used as a forced command, but some may be risky choices. In the examples that follow, we cover several of these issues as they’re encountered.  Rejecting connections with a custom message  8.2.3.2 Suppose you’ve permitted a friend to access your account by SSH, but now you’ve decided to disable the access. You can simply remove his key from your authoriza- tion file, but here’s something fancier. You can define a forced command to print a custom message for your friend, indicating that his access has been disabled. For example:   OpenSSH command=" bin echo Sorry, buddy, but you've been terminated!" ...key...   Tectia Key friend.pub Options command=" bin echo Sorry, buddy, but you've been terminated!"  Any incoming SSH connection that successfully authenticates with this key causes the following message to be displayed on standard output:  Sorry, buddy, but you've been terminated!  and then the connection closes. If you’d like to print a longer message, which might be awkward to include in your authorization file, you can store it in a separate file  say, ~ go.away  and display it using an appropriate program  e.g., cat :   OpenSSH command=" bin cat $HOME go.away" ...key...   Tectia Key friend.pub Options command=" bin cat $HOME go.away"  Since the message is long, you might be tempted to display it one screenful at a time with a pager program such as more or less. Don’t do it!   OpenSSH: Don't do this! command=" usr bin less $HOME go.away" ...key...  This forced command opens an unwanted hole into your account: the less program, like most Unix pager programs, has a shell escape. Instead of restricting access to your account, this forced command permits unlimited access.*  * The less program has a secure mode that disables shell escapes. See the manpage for less about the environ-  ment variable LESSSECURE.  334    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   8.2.3.3 Displaying a command menu Suppose you want to provide limited access to your account, permitting the incom- ing SSH client to invoke only a few, specific programs. Forced commands can accomplish this. For instance, you can write a shell script that permits a known set of programs to be executed and then run the script as a forced command. A sample script, shown in Example 8-1, permits only three programs to be chosen from a menu.  Example 8-1. Menu script  ! bin sh  bin echo "Welcome! Your choices are:  1       See today's date 2       See who's logged in 3       See current processes q       Quit"   bin echo "Your choice: \c" read ans while [ "$ans" != "q" ] do   case "$ans" in     1           bin date         ;;     2           bin who         ;;     3           usr ucb w         ;;     q           bin echo "Goodbye"         exit 0         ;;     *           bin echo "Invalid choice '$ans': please try again"         ;;   esac    bin echo "Your choice: \c"   read ans done exit 0  When someone accesses your account by public key and invokes the forced com- mand, the script displays:  Welcome! Your choices are:  1       See today's date  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    335    2       See who's logged in  3       See current processes  q       Quit  Your choice:  The user may then type 1, 2, 3, or q to run the associated program. Any other input is ignored, so no other programs can be executed.  Such scripts must be written carefully to avoid security holes. In particular, none of the permitted programs should provide a means to escape to a shell, or else the user may execute any command in your account.  Examining the client’s original command  8.2.3.4 As we’ve seen, a forced command gets substituted for any other command the SSH client might send. If an SSH client attempts to invoke the program ps:  but a forced command is set up to execute “ bin who” instead:  $ ssh server.example.com ps   OpenSSH command=" bin who" ...key...   Tectia key mykey.pub Options command=" bin who"  then ps is ignored and  bin who runs instead. Nevertheless, the SSH server does read the original command string sent by the client and stores it in an environment vari- able. For OpenSSH, the environment variable is SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND, and for Tec- tia, it’s SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND. So, in our example, the value of SSH_ORIGINAL_ COMMAND would be ps.  A quick way to see these variables in action is to print their values with forced com- mands. For OpenSSH, create a forced command like the following:   OpenSSH command=" bin echo You tried to invoke $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ...key...  Then connect with an SSH client, supplying a remote command  which won’t be executed , such as:  $ ssh server.example.com cat  etc passwd  Instead of executing cat, the OpenSSH server simply prints:  You tried to invoke cat  etc passwd  and exits. Similarly, for Tectia, you can set up a forced command like this:   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options command=" bin echo You tried to invoke $SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND"  336    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Then, a client command like:  $ ssh server.example.com cat  etc passwd  produces:  You tried to invoke cat  etc passwd  Restricting a client’s original command  8.2.3.5 Let’s try a slightly more complex example using the environment variable SSH_ ORIGINAL_COMMAND. We create a forced command that examines the environment vari- able and turns a requested command into another of our choice. For example, sup- pose you want to permit a friend to invoke remote commands in your account, except for the rm  remove file  command. In other words, a command like:  $ ssh server.example.com rm myfile  is rejected. Here’s a script that checks for the presence of rm in the command string and, if present, rejects the command:  ! bin sh  OpenSSH.  For Tectia, use $SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND.  case "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" in   *rm*      echo "Sorry, rejected"     ;;   *      $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND     ;; esac   OpenSSH command="$HOME rm-checker" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options command="$HOME rm-checker"  Save this script in ~ rm-checker, and define a forced command to use it:  Our script is just an example: it isn’t secure. It can be easily bypassed by a clever command sequence to remove a file:  $ ssh server.example.com ' bin ln -s  bin r? . killer && . killer myfile'  which creates a link to  bin rm with a different name  killer  and then performs the removal. Nevertheless, the concept is still valid: you can examine SSH_ORIGINAL_ COMMAND to select another command to execute instead.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    337   Logging a client’s original command  8.2.3.6 Another cool use of the “original command” environment variables is to keep a log of commands that are run using a given key. For example:   OpenSSH command="log-and-run" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options command="log-and-run"  where log-and-run is the following script. It appends a line to a log file, containing a timestamp and the command attempted:  ! bin sh  OpenSSH.  For Tectia, use $SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND. if [ -n "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ] then   echo "` bin date`: $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" >> $HOME ssh-command-log   exec $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND fi  Forced commands and secure copy  scp   8.2.3.7 We’ve seen what happens when ssh encounters a key with a forced command. But what does scp do in this situation? Does the forced command run, or does the copy operation take place?  In this case, the forced command executes, and the original operation  file copy  is ignored. Depending on your needs, this behavior might be good or bad. In general, we do not recommend using scp with any key that has a forced command. Instead, use two keys, one for ordinary logins and file copying and the other for the forced command.  Now that we’ve thoroughly examined forced commands, let’s move on to other fea- tures of per-account configuration.  Restricting Access by Host or Domain  8.2.4 Public-key authentication requires two pieces of information: the corresponding pri- vate key and its passphrase  if any . Without either piece, authentication can’t suc- ceed. Per-account configuration lets you add a third requirement for additional security: a restriction on the client’s hostname or IP address.  8.2.4.1 OpenSSH host access control In OpenSSH, host access control is accomplished in the authorized_keys file with the from option. For example:   OpenSSH from="client.example.com" ...key...  338    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   enforces that any SSH connection must come from client.example.com, or else it is rejected. Therefore, if your private-key file is somehow stolen, and your passphrase cracked, an attacker might still be stymied if he can’t connect from the authorized client machine.  If the concept of “from” sounds familiar, you’ve got a good memory: it’s the same access control provided by the AllowUsers keyword for serverwide configuration. [5.5.1] The authorized_keys option, however, is set by you within your account and applies to a single key, while AllowUsers is specified by the system administra- tor and applies to all connections to an account. Here’s an example to demon- strate the difference. Suppose you want to permit connections from remote.org to enter the benjamin account. As system administrator, you can configure this within  etc ssh sshd_config:  Using per-account configuration, the user benjamin can configure the identical set- ting within his authorized_keys file, for a particular key only:   OpenSSH AllowUsers benjamin@remote.org   OpenSSH  File ~benjamin .ssh authorized_keys from="remote.org" ...key...   OpenSSH DenyUsers benjamin@remote.org  Of course, the serverwide setting takes precedence. If the system administrator had denied this access using the DenyUsers keyword:  then user benjamin can’t override this restriction using the from option in authorized_keys.  Just like AllowUsers, the from option can use the wildcard characters *, matching any string, and ?, matching any one character:  from="*.someplace.org" from="som?pla?e.org"  Matches any host in the someplace.org domain Matches somXplaYe.org but not foo.someXplaYe.org or foo.somplace.org  It may also match the client IP address, with or without wildcards:  from="192.220.18.5" from="192.2??.18.*"  There can also be multiple patterns, this time separated by commas  AllowUsers employs spaces . No whitespace is allowed. You may also negate a pattern by prefix- ing it with an exclamation point  ! . The exact matching rules are: every pattern in the list is compared to either the client’s canonical hostname or its IP address. If the pattern contains only numerals, dots, and wildcards, it is matched against the  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    339   address, otherwise, it is matched against the hostname.* The connection is accepted if and only if the client matches at least one positive pattern and no negated pat- terns. So for example, the following rule denies connections from saruman.ring.org, allows connections from other hosts in the domain ring.org, and denies everything else:  from="!saruman.ring.org,*.ring.org"  while this one again denies saruman.ring.org but allows all other clients:  from="!saruman.ring.org,*"  Remember that access control by hostname may be problematic, due to issues with name resolution and security. [3.4.3.6] Fortunately, the from option is just an auxil- iary feature of OpenSSH public-key authentication, which provides stronger security than would an entirely hostname-based solution.  Tectia host access control  8.2.4.2 Host access control in Tectia is accomplished in the authorization file with the allow- from and deny-from options. For example, to permit connections to your account from the example.com domain:   ~ .ssh2 authorization Key mykey.pub Options allow-from="example.com" or to deny them from very.evil.org:   ~ .ssh2 authorization Key otherkey.pub Options deny-from="very.evil.org"  These options follow the same rules as the AllowHosts and DenyHosts server configu- ration keywords, respectively. [5.5.3] However, allow-from and deny-from control access per key, rather than serverwide.  Setting Environment Variables  8.2.5 The environment option instructs the SSH server to set an environment variable when a client connects via the given key. For example, the OpenSSH authorized_keys line:   OpenSSH environment="EDITOR=emacs" ...key...  or Tectia authorization file option:   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options environment="editor=emacs"  * OpenSSH unfortunately doesn’t let you specify arbitrary IP networks using an address and mask, nor by “address   number of bits.” libwrap does [9.5], but its restrictions apply to all connections, not on a per-key basis.  340    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   sets the environment variable EDITOR to the value emacs, thereby setting the client’s default editor for the login session. The syntax following environment= is a quoted string containing a variable, an equals sign, and a value. All characters between the quotes are significant, i.e., the value may contain whitespace:   OpenSSH environment="MYVARIABLE=this value has whitespace in it" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options environment="MYVARIABLE=this value has whitespace in it"  or even a double quote, if you escape it with a forward slash:   OpenSSH environment="MYVARIABLE=I have a quote\" in my middle" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options environment="MYVARIABLE=I have a quote\" in my middle" Also, a single key may have multiple environment variables set:   OpenSSH environment="EDITOR=emacs",environment="MYVARIABLE=26" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub environment="EDITOR=emacs",environment="MYVARIABLE=26"  Why set an environment variable for a key? This feature lets you tailor your account to respond differently based on which key is used. For example, suppose you create two keys, each of which sets a different value for an environment variable—say, SPECIAL:   OpenSSH environment="SPECIAL=1" ...key... environment="SPECIAL=2" ...key...   Tectia Key key1.pub Options environment="SPECIAL=1" Key key2.pub Options environment="SPECIAL=2"   In your .login file switch  $SPECIAL    case 1:     echo 'Hello Bob!'     set prompt = 'bob> '     breaksw   case 2:  Now, in your account’s shell configuration file, you can examine $SPECIAL and trig- ger actions specific to each key:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    341       echo 'Hello Jane!'     set prompt = jane> '     source ~ .janerc     breaksw endsw  Here, we print a custom welcome message for each key user, set an appropriate shell prompt, and in Jane’s case, invoke a custom initialization script, ~ .janerc. Thus, the environment option provides a convenient communication channel between a partic- ular key and the remote shell.  Example: CVS and $LOGNAME  8.2.5.1 As a more advanced example of the environment option, suppose a team of open source software developers around the Internet is developing a computer program. The team decides to practice good software engineering and store its code with CVS, the Concurrent Versions System, a popular version control tool. Lacking the funds to set up a server machine, the team places the CVS repository into the computer account of one of the team members, Benjamin, since he has lots of available disk space. Benjamin’s account is on the SSH server machine cvs.repo.com.  The other developers do not have accounts on cvs.repo.com, so Benjamin places their public keys into his authorized_keys file so that they can do check-ins. Now there’s a problem. When a developer changes a file and checks the new version into the repos- itory, a log entry is made by CVS, identifying the author of the change. But everyone is connecting through the benjamin account, so CVS always identifies the author as “benjamin,” no matter who checked in the changes. This is bad from a software engineering standpoint: the author of each change should be clearly identified.*  You can eliminate this problem by modifying Benjamin’s file, preceding each devel- oper’s key with an environment option. CVS examines the LOGNAME environment vari- able to get the author’s name, so you set LOGNAME differently for each developer’s key:   OpenSSH environment="LOGNAME=dan" ...key... environment="LOGNAME=richard" ...key... ...   Tectia Key dan.pub Options environment="LOGNAME=dan" Key richard.pub Options environment="LOGNAME=richard" ...  * In an industrial setting, each developer would have an account on the CVS repository machine, so the prob-  lem wouldn’t exist.  342    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Problem solved!*  Setting Idle Timeout  8.2.6 Tectia’s idle-timeout option tells the SSH server to disconnect a session that has been idle for a certain time limit. This is just like Tectia’s IdleTimeout keyword for serverwide configuration but is set by you within your account, instead of by the sys- tem administrator. [5.3.3.5] Suppose you let your friend Jamie access your account by SSH. Jamie works in an untrusted environment, however, and you are worried that he might walk away from his computer while connected to your account, and someone else might come by and use his session. One way to reduce the risk is to set an idle timeout on Jamie’s key, automatically disconnecting the SSH session after a given period of idle time. If the client stops sending output for a while, Jamie has probably walked away, and the session is terminated. Timeouts are set with the idle-timeout option. For example, to set the idle timeout to 60 seconds:  idle-timeout uses the same notation for time as the IdleTimeout server keyword. [5.3.3.5] It also overrides any serverwide value set with the IdleTimeout keyword. For example, if the serverwide idle timeout is five minutes:  but your authorization file sets it to 10 minutes for your account:   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options idle-timeout=60s   Tectia IdleTimeout 5m   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options idle-timeout=10m  then any connection using this key has an idle timeout of 10 minutes, regardless of the serverwide setting.  This feature has more uses than disconnecting absent typists. Suppose you’re using an SSH key for an automated process, such as backups. An idle timeout value kills the process automatically if it hangs due to an error.  * Incidentally, the authors used this technique while collaborating on this book.

[9.2] To prevent this, use the no-port-forwarding option for that key:   OpenSSH no-port-forwarding ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options no-port-forwarding   OpenSSH no-x11-forwarding ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options no-x11-forwarding   OpenSSH no-agent-forwarding ...key...   Tectia Options no-agent-forwarding  Rather than disable forwarding, OpenSSH can place limits on it with the permitopen option for a key. For example, to restrict port forwarding to local port 12345 con- necting to remote host server.example.com:   OpenSSH permitopen="server.example.com:12345" ...key...  permitopen may have multiple values separated by commas. The syntax is hostname: port for IPv4 addresses and hostname port for IPv6 addresses.  X forwarding [9.4] can be prohibited per key with the no-x11-forwarding option:  Agent forwarding can also be disabled per key, if you don’t want remote users to travel through your account and onto other computers using the given key. [6.3.5] This is done with the no-agent-forwarding option:  These aren’t strong restrictions. As long as you allow shell access, just about anything can be done over the connection. The user need employ only a pair of custom programs that talk to each other across the connection and directly implement port forwarding, agent for- warding, or anything else you thought you were preventing. To be more than just a reminder or mild deterrent, these options must be used together with carefully restricted access on the server side, such as forced commands or a restricted shell on the target account.  344    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Disabling TTY Allocation  8.2.8 Normally, when you log in via SSH, the server allocates a pseudo-terminal  hence- forth, tty  for the login session: [7.4.6.5]   A tty is allocated for this client $ ssh server.example.com  The server even sets an environment variable, SSH_TTY for OpenSSH or SSH2_TTY for Tectia, with the name of the tty allocated. For example:   After logging in via OpenSSH $ echo $SSH_TTY  dev pts 1  Use $SSH2_TTY for Tectia  When you run a noninteractive command, however, the SSH server doesn’t allocate a tty to set the environment variable, e.g.:   OpenSSH: No tty is allocated $ ssh server.example.com  bin ls  Suppose you want to give someone SSH access for invoking noninteractive com- mands, but not for running an interactive login session. You’ve seen how forced commands can limit access to a particular program, but as an added safety precau- tion, you can also disable tty allocation with the no-pty option:   OpenSSH no-pty ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options no-pty  Noninteractive commands will now work normally, but requests for interactive ses- sions are refused by the SSH server. If you try to establish an interactive session, your client may appear to hang.* Run it in verbose mode to see the reason:   OpenSSH output debug1: Remote: Pty allocation disabled.  Just for fun, let’s observe the effect of no-pty on the environment variable with a sim- ple experiment. Set up a public key and precede it with the following forced command:   OpenSSH command="echo SSH_TTY is [$SSH_TTY]" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options command="echo SSH2_TTY is [$SSH2_TTY]"  * If the connection hangs and your client appears to be frozen, type the ssh escape character followed by a  period  usually ~. unless you’ve overridden it  to close the connection.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  8.2 Public-Key-Based Configuration    345   Now try connecting noninteractively and interactively, and watch the output. The interactive command assigns a value to the environment variable, but the noninterac- tive one doesn’t:  $ ssh server.example.com SSH_TTY is [ dev pts 2]  For Tectia it would be SSH2_TTY  $ ssh server.example.com anything SSH_TTY is []  For Tectia it would be SSH2_TTY  Next, add the no-pty option:   OpenSSH no-pty,command="echo SSH_TTY is [$SSH_TTY]" ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub no-pty,command="echo SSH_TTY is [$SSH_TTY]"  and try connecting interactively. The connection  properly  fails and the environ- ment variable has no value:  $ ssh server.example.com SSH_TTY is [] Connection to server.example.com closed.  For Tectia it would be SSH2_TTY  Even if a client requests a tty specifically  with ssh -t , the no-pty option forbids its allocation. For instance, if you try running the Emacs editor over the SSH connection:  $ ssh -t server.example.com emacs  Emacs will fail to run or appear to hang.  Hostbased Access Control  8.3 A limited type of per-account configuration is possible in OpenSSH if you use host- based authentication rather than public-key authentication. Specifically, you can per- mit SSH access to your account based on the client’s remote username and hostname via the system files  etc shosts.equiv and  etc hosts.equiv, and personal files ~ .rhosts and ~ .shosts. A line like:  +client.example.com jones  permits hostbased SSH access by the user jones@client.example.com. Since we’ve already covered the details of these four files, we won’t repeat the information in this chapter. [3.6.2]  Per-account configuration with hostbased authentication is similar to using host access control in your OpenSSH authorized_keys or Tectia authorization file. [8.2.4] Both methods may restrict SSH connections from particular hosts. The differences are shown in this table:  346    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Feature Authenticate by hostname Authenticate by IP address Authenticate by remote username Wildcards in hostnames and IP Passphrase required for logins Use other public-key features Security  Hostbased access Yes Yes Yes No No No Less  Public-key host access Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes More  To use hostbased authentication for access control, all of the following conditions must be true:    Hostbased authentication is enabled in the server, both at compile time and in  the serverwide configuration file.    Your desired client hosts aren’t specifically excluded by serverwide configura-  tion, e.g., by AllowHosts and DenyHosts.    For OpenSSH, the server configuration keyword EnableSSHKeysign must be set to  yes.*  Despite its capabilities, hostbased authentication is more complex than one might expect. For example, file denies access to sandy@trusted.example.com:  if your carefully crafted .shosts  but your .rhosts file inadvertently permits access:   ~ .shosts -trusted.example.com sandy   ~ .rhosts +trusted.example.com  then sandy will have SSH access to your account. Worse, even if you don’t have a ~ .rhosts file, the system files  etc hosts.equiv and  etc shosts.equiv can still punch a hostbased security hole into your account against your wishes. Unfortunately, using per-account configuration, there’s no way to prevent this problem. Only compile-time or serverwide configuration can disable hostbased authentication.  Because of these issues and other serious, inherent weaknesses, we recommend against using the weak form of hostbased authentication, Rhosts authentication, as a form of per-account configuration.  By default it is disabled, and we approve.  If you require the features of hostbased authentication, we recommend the stronger form, called RhostsRSAAuthentication  OpenSSH  or hostbased  Tectia , which adds cryp- tographic verification of host keys.  * In olden days, the ssh executable needed to be setuid root.

All rights reserved.  8.3 Hostbased Access Control    347   The User rc File  8.4 The shell script  etc ssh sshrc is invoked by the SSH server for each incoming SSH connection. [5.6.3] You may define a similar script in your account, ~ .ssh rc  OpenSSH  or ~ .ssh2 rc  Tectia , to be invoked for every SSH connection to your account. If this file exists,  etc ssh sshrc isn’t run.  The SSH rc file is much like a shell startup file  e.g., ~ .profile or ~ .cshrc , but it exe- cutes only when your account is accessed by SSH. It is run for both interactive logins and remote commands. Place any commands in this script that you would like exe- cuted when your account is accessed by SSH, rather than an ordinary login. For example, you can run and load your ssh-agent in this file:   ~ .ssh rc, assuming your login shell is the C shell if   ! $?SSH_AUTH_SOCK    then   eval `ssh-agent`    usr bin tty  grep 'not a tty' >  dev null   if   ! $status   then     ssh-add   endif endif  Like  etc ssh sshrc, your personal rc file is executed just before the shell or remote command requested by the incoming connection. OpenSSH always uses the Bourne shell   bin sh  for ~ .ssh rc, as it does for  etc ssh sshrc. In contrast, Tectia uses your login shell for ~ .ssh2 rc, unlike  etc ssh2 sshrc.  Summary  8.5 Per-account configuration lets you instruct the SSH server to treat your account differ- ently. Using public-key authentication, you can permit or restrict connections based on a client’s key, hostname, or IP address. With forced commands, you can limit the set of programs that a client may run in your account. You can also disable unwanted features of SSH, such as port forwarding, agent forwarding, and tty allocation.  Using hostbased authentication, you can permit or restrict particular hosts or remote users from accessing your account. This uses the file ~ .shosts or  less opti- mally  ~ .rhosts. However, the mechanism is less secure and less flexible than public-key authentication.  348    Chapter 8: Per-Account Server Configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

A terminal session secured by SSH behaves like an ordinary, insecure one  e.g., created by telnet or rsh  once it has been established. Behind the scenes, however, SSH keeps the session secure with strong authentication, encryption, and integrity checking.  In some situations, however, transparency is hard to achieve. A network firewall might be in the way, interfering with certain network traffic you need. Corporate security policies might prohibit you from storing SSH keys on certain machines. Or you might need to use insecure network applications in a secure environment.  In this chapter, we’ll discuss an important feature of SSH, called forwarding or tun- neling, that addresses several concerns about transparency:  Securing other TCP IP applications  SSH can transparently encrypt another application’s data stream. This is called port forwarding.  Securing X Window applications  Using SSH, you can invoke X programs on a remote machine and have them appear, securely, on your local display.  This feature of X is insecure ordinarily.  This is called X forwarding, a special case of port forwarding for which SSH has extra support.  SSH forwarding isn’t completely transparent, since it occurs at the application level, not the network level. Applications must be configured to participate in forwarding, and a few protocols are problematic to forward  FTP data channels are a notable example . But in most common situations, once a secure tunnel is set up, the partici- pating applications appear to the user to operate normally. For complete application- level transparency, you need a network-level technique, such as IPSEC [1.6.4] or a proprietary Virtual Private Network  VPN  technology available from various ven- dors, in host software or dedicated routers. While VPNs provide a more complete solution, they require significantly more work and expense to set up compared to SSH forwarding.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  349   So, when we say “transparent” in this chapter, we mean “transparent to the applica- tion, once a little configuration has been done.”  In this chapter, we discuss SSH forwarding techniques to allow other- wise prohibited traffic across firewalls. This can be a perfectly legiti- mate and adequately safe practice if done properly: the firewall prevents unauthorized traffic, while SSH forwarding allows autho- rized users to bypass the restriction. However, don’t forget you are bypassing a security restriction that is in place for a reason. Be sure to follow the guidelines we give for safe SSH forwarding. Also, take care that you are not violating a company policy by using forwarding. Just because you can do something doesn’t automatically mean that it’s a good idea. If in doubt, consult with your system administrators.  9.1 What Is Forwarding? Forwarding is a type of interaction with another network application, as shown in Figure 9-1. SSH intercepts a service request from some other program on one side of an SSH connection, sends it across the encrypted connection, and delivers it to the intended recipient on the other side. This process is mostly transparent to both sides of the connection: each believes it is talking directly to its partner and has no knowl- edge that forwarding is taking place. Even more powerfully, SSH forwarding can achieve certain types of communication that are impossible without it.  Host A  Host B  application  client  direct connection  application  server  forwarded connection  SSH  SSH  Figure 9-1. SSH forwarding  Forwarding isn’t a new concept. The basic operation of a terminal connection over a network  say, using telnet  is also a kind of forwarding. In a telnet connection, you sit on one end, your remote shell is on the other, and both sides operate as if directly connected by a serial cable. Nevertheless, sitting in the middle is a cooperating telnet client and server, forwarding bytes back and forth. SSH forwarding is much the same, except SSH plays fancy tricks with the data to add security.  We have also seen another type of SSH forwarding, agent forwarding. [6.3.5] This let us create SSH connections from one computer, through a second computer, and  350    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   onto a third using public-key authentication, but without installing our private key on the second machine. To accomplish this, an SSH server pretended to be an SSH agent, while transparently forwarding data to and from a remote agent. This para- digm holds true for TCP port forwarding and X forwarding, as the SSH server trans- parently masquerades as another network application.  Port Forwarding  9.2 SSH uses TCP IP as its transport mechanism, usually TCP port 22 on the server machine, as it encrypts and decrypts the traffic passing over the connection. We now discuss a cool feature that encrypts and decrypts TCP IP traffic belonging to other applications, on other TCP ports, using SSH. This process, called port forwarding, is largely transparent and quite powerful. Telnet, SMTP, NNTP, IMAP, and other inse- cure protocols running over TCP can be made secure by forwarding the connections through SSH. Port forwarding is sometimes called tunneling because the SSH connec- tion provides a secure “tunnel” through which another TCP IP connection may pass.  Suppose you have a home machine H that runs an IMAP-capable email reader, and you want to connect to an IMAP server on machine S to read and send mail. Nor- mally, this connection is insecure, with your mail account password transmitted as plaintext between your mail program and the server. With SSH port forwarding, you can transparently reroute the IMAP connection  found on server S’s TCP port 143  to pass through SSH, securely encrypting the data over the connection.* The IMAP server machine must be running an SSH server for port forwarding to provide real protection.  In short, with minimal configuration changes to your programs, SSH port forward- ing protects arbitrary TCP IP connections by redirecting them through an SSH ses- sion. Port forwarding can even pass a connection safely through a firewall if you configure things properly. Once you start securing your communications with port forwarding, you’ll wonder how you ever got along without it. Here are examples of what you can do:    Access various kinds of TCP servers  e.g., SMTP, IMAP, POP, LDAP, etc.  across  a firewall that prevents direct access.    Provide protection for your sessions with these same TCP servers, preventing disclosure or alteration of passwords and other content that would otherwise be sent in the clear as part of the session.  * Our port forwarding example protects your IMAP connection but doesn’t truly protect your email messages. Before reaching your IMAP server, the messages pass through other mail servers and may be intercepted in transit. For end-to-end email security, you and your correspondent should use tools such as PGP or S MIME to sign and or encrypt the messages themselves.

All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    351     Tunnel the control connection of an FTP session, to encrypt your username, password, and commands.  It isn’t usually possible to protect the data channels that carry the file contents, though. [11.2]     Use your ISP’s SMTP servers for sending mail, even if you’re connected outside the ISP’s network and the ISP forbids mail relaying from your current location. [11.3.2]  SSH port forwarding is a general proxying mechanism for TCP only.  See the sidebar “TCP Connections” for an overview of TCP concepts.  Forwarding can’t work with protocols not built on TCP, such as the UDP-based DNS, DHCP, NFS, and NetBIOS,* or with non-IP-based protocols, such as AppleTalk or Novell’s SPX IPX.  Local Forwarding  9.2.1 In our earlier example, we had an IMAP server running on machine S, and an email reader on home machine H, and we wanted to secure the IMAP connection using SSH. Let’s delve into that example in more detail.  IMAP uses TCP port 143; this means that an IMAP server listens for connections on port 143 on the server machine. To tunnel the IMAP connection through SSH, we need to pick a local port on home machine H  between 1024 and 65535  and for- ward it to the remote socket  S,143 . Suppose you randomly pick local port 2001. The following command then creates the tunnel:†  $ ssh -L2001:localhost:143 S  The –L option specifies local forwarding, in which the TCP client is on the local machine with the SSH client. The option is followed by three values separated by colons: a local port to listen on  2001 , the remote machine name or IP address  S , and the remote, target port number  143 .  The previous command logs you into S, just like ssh S does. However, this SSH ses- sion has also forwarded TCP port 2001 on H to port 143 on S; the forwarding remains in effect until you log out of the session. To make use of the tunnel, the final step is to tell your email reader to use the forwarded port. Normally, your email pro- gram connects to port 143 on the server machine—that is, the socket  S,143 . Instead, it’s configured to connect to port 2001 on home machine H itself, i.e., socket  localhost,2001 . So the path of the connection follows the list shown next.  * We’re being a little imprecise here. DHCP is entirely based on UDP, so SSH port forwarding can’t do any- thing with it. The others, however, either use both TCP and UDP for different purposes or can sometimes be configured to run over TCP, though they generally use UDP. Nevertheless, in most common situations, SSH can’t forward them.  † You can also use ssh -L2001:S:143 S, substituting “S” for localhost, but we discuss later why localhost is the  better alternative when possible.  352    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   TCP Connections  To understand port forwarding, it’s important to know some details about TCP, the Transmission Control Protocol. TCP is a fundamental building block of the Internet. Built on top of IP, it is the transport mechanism for many application-level Internet protocols such as FTP, Telnet, HTTP, SMTP, POP, IMAP, and SSH itself. TCP comes with strong guarantees. A TCP connection is a virtual, full-duplex circuit between two communicating parties, acting like a two-way pipe. Either side may write any number of bytes at any time to the pipe, and the bytes are guaranteed to arrive unaltered and in order at the other side.a If an application doesn’t need these strong guarantees, or doesn’t want the overhead associated with them, another protocol called UDP  User Datagram Protocol  often suffices. It is packet-oriented, rather than connection-based, and has no guarantees of delivery or packet ordering. Some proto- cols that exclusively or commonly run over UDP are NFS, DNS, DHCP, NetBIOS, TFTP, Kerberos, SYSLOG, and NTP. When a program establishes a TCP connection to a service, the program needs two pieces of information: the IP address of the destination machine, and a way to identify the desired service. TCP  and UDP  use a positive integer, called a port number, to iden- tify a service. For example, SSH uses port 22, telnet uses port 23, and IMAP uses port 143. Port numbers allow multiple services at the same IP address. If you combine an IP address and a port number, the pair is called a socket. For exam- ple, if you run telnet to connect to port 23 on the machine at IP address 128.220.91.4, the socket is denoted “ 128.220.91.4,23 .” Simply put, when you make a TCP connec- tion, its destination is a socket. The source  client program  also has a socket on its end of the connection, and the connection as a whole is completely defined by the pair of source and destination sockets. In order for a connection attempt to a socket to succeed, something must be “listening” on that socket. That is, a program running on the destination machine has asked TCP to accept connection requests on that port, and to pass the connections on to the pro- gram. If you’ve ever attempted a TCP connection and received the response “connec- tion refused,” it means that the remote machine is up and running, but nothing is listening on the target socket. How does a client program know the target port number of a listening server? Port numbers for many protocols are standardized, being assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  IANA .b For instance, the TCP port number assigned to the NNTP  Usenet news  protocol is 119. Therefore, news servers listen on port 119, and newsreaders  clients  connect to them via port 119. More specifically, if a newsreader is configured to talk to a news server at IP address 10.1.2.3, it requests a TCP connec- tion to the socket  10.1.2.3,119 .  —continued—  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    353   Port numbers are not always hardcoded into programs. Many operating systems let applications refer to protocols by name, instead of number, by defining a table of TCP names and port numbers. Programs can then look up port numbers by the protocol name. Under Unix, the table is often contained in the file  etc services or the NIS ser- vices map, and queries are performed using the library routines getservbyname, getservbyport, and related procedures. Other environments allow servers to register their listening ports dynamically via a naming service, such as the AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol or DNS’s WKS and SRV records. So far, we’ve discussed the port number used by a TCP server when a TCP client pro- gram wants to connect. We call this the target port number. The client also uses a port number, called the source port number, so the server can transmit to the client. If you combine the client’s IP address and its source port number, you get the client’s socket. Unlike target port numbers, source port numbers are not standard. In most cases, in fact, neither the client nor the server cares which source port number is used by the client. Often a client lets TCP select an unused port number for the source.c If you examine the existing TCP connections on a machine with a command like netstat -a or lsof -i tcp, you’ll see connections to the well-known port numbers for common services  e.g., 23 for telnet, 22 for SSH , with large, apparently random source port numbers on the other end. Those source ports were chosen from the range of unassigned ports by TCP on the machines initiating those connections. Once established, a TCP connection is completely determined by the combination of its source and target sockets. Therefore, multiple TCP clients may connect to the same target socket. If the connections originate from different hosts, then the IP address por- tions of their source sockets differ, distinguishing the connections. If they come from two different programs running on the same host, then TCP on that host ensures they have different source port numbers.  a. The mechanisms used to implement these guarantees, though, are designed to counter transmission problems in the network, such as routing around failed links, or retransmitting data corrupted by noise or lost due to temporary network congestion. They are not very effective against deliberate attempts to steal a connection or alter data in transit part. SSH provides this protection that TCP alone lacks.  b. IANA’s complete list of port numbers is found at http:  www.isi.edu in-notes iana assignments port-  numbers .  c. The Berkeley r-commands, however, do care about source ports.  1. The email reader on home machine H sends data to local port 2001. 2. The local SSH client on H reads port 2001, encrypts the data, and sends it  through the SSH connection to the SSH server on S.  354    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3. The SSH server on S decrypts the data and sends it to the IMAP server listening  4. Data is sent back from the IMAP server to home machine H by the same process  on port 143 on S.  in reverse.  Port forwarding can be specified only when you create an SSH connection. You can’t add a forwarding to an existing SSH connection with any SSH implementation we know of, though there’s nothing intrinsic to the SSH protocol that would prevent it, and it would sometimes be a useful feature. Instead of using the –L option to estab- lish a local forwarding, you can use the LocalForward keyword in your client configu- ration file:  Note the small syntactic differences. In OpenSSH, there are two arguments: the local port number, and the remote socket expressed as host:port. In Tectia, the expression is just as on the command line, except that it must be enclosed in double quotes. If you forget the quotes, ssh doesn’t complain, but it doesn’t forward the port, either.  Our example with home machine H and IMAP server S can be set up like this:    OpenSSH LocalForward 2001 localhost:143  Tectia LocalForward "2001:localhost:143"    OpenSSH Host local-forwarding-example  HostName S  LocalForward 2001 localhost:143   Run on home machine H $ ssh local-forwarding-example  Local forwarding and GatewayPorts  9.2.1.1 In OpenSSH, by default, only the host running the SSH client can connect to locally forwarded ports. This is because ssh listens only on the machine’s loopback inter- face for connections to the forwarded port; that is, it binds the socket  local- host,2001 , a.k.a.  127.0.0.1,2001 , and not  H,2001 . So, in the preceding example, only machine H can use the forwarding; attempts by other machines to connect to  H,2001  get the message “connection refused.” However, ssh for OpenSSH has a command-line option, –g, that disables this restriction, permitting any host to con- nect to locally forwarded ports:   OpenSSH $ ssh -g -L : :  hostname  The client configuration keyword GatewayPorts also controls this feature; the default value is no, whereas yes does the same thing as –g:    OpenSSH GatewayPorts yes  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    355   Tectia provides the +g option as the opposite of –g.  GatewayPorts and –g are disabled by default. They are a security risk. [9.2.4.3]  Remote forwarding  9.2.1.2 A remotely forwarded port is just like a local one, but the directions are reversed. This time the TCP client is remote, its server is local, and a forwarded connection is initiated from the remote machine.  Continuing with our example, suppose instead that you are logged into server machine S to begin with, where the IMAP server is running. You can now create a secure tunnel for remote clients to reach the IMAP server on port 143. Once again, you select a random port number to forward  say, 2001 again  and create the tunnel:  $ ssh -R2001:localhost:143 H  The –R option specifies remote forwarding. It is followed by three values, separated by colons as before but interpreted slightly differently. The remote port to be for- warded  2001  is now first, followed by the machine name or IP address  localhost  and port number  143 . SSH can now forward connections from  localhost,143  to  H,2001 .  Once this command has run, a secure tunnel has been constructed from the port 2001 on the remote machine H, to port 143 on the server machine S. Now any pro- gram on H can use the secure tunnel by connecting to  localhost,2001 . As before, the command also runs an SSH terminal session on remote machine H, just as ssh H does.  As with local forwarding, you may establish a remote forwarding using a keyword in your client configuration file. The RemoteForward keyword is analogous to LocalForward, with the same syntactic differences between OpenSSH and Tectia:  For example, here’s the preceding forwarding defined in a Tectia-format configura- tion file:   OpenSSH RemoteForward 2001 S:143   Tectia RemoteForward "2001:S:143"   Tectia remote-forwarding-example:  Host H  RemoteForward "2001:S:143"  $ ssh remote-forwarding-example  356    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   You might think that the GatewayPorts feature discussed in the last section applies equally well to remote port forwardings. This would make sense as a feature, but as it happens, it isn’t done. There would have to be a way for the client to communicate this parameter to the server for a given forwarding, and that feature hasn’t been included in the SSH protocol. In Tectia, remotely forwarded ports always listen on all network interfaces and accept connections from anywhere. The OpenSSH server does accept the GatewayPorts configuration option, and it applies globally to all remote forwardings established by that server. This allows the server administrator to control whether users can bind to nonlocal sockets.  Trouble with Multiple Connections  9.2.2 If you use LocalForward or RemoteForward in your configuration file, you might run into a subtle problem. Suppose you have set up a section in your configuration file to forward local port 2001 to an IMAP server:   OpenSSH  syntax used for illustration Host server.example.com  LocalForward 2001 server.example.com:143  This configuration works fine if you connect once:  $ ssh server.example.com  But if you try to open a second ssh connection to server.example.com at the same time—perhaps to run a different program in another window of your workstation— the attempt fails:  $ ssh server.example.com Local: bind: Address already in use  Why does this happen? Because your configuration file section tries to forward port 2001 again but finds that port is already in use  “bound” for listening  by the first instance of ssh. You need some way to make the connection but omit the port for- warding.  OpenSSH provides a solution, the client configuration keyword ClearAllForwardings. From the name, you might think it terminates existing forwardings, but it doesn’t. Rather, it nullifies any forwardings specified in the current ssh command. In the previ- ous example, you can connect without forwardings to server.example.com with:   OpenSSH $ ssh -o ClearAllForwardings=yes server.example.com  tunnel, set up by the first  The original invocation, continues to exist, but ClearAllForwardings prevents the second invocation from attempting to re-create the tunnel. To illustrate the point further, here’s a rather silly command:   OpenSSH $ ssh -L2001:localhost:143 -o ClearAllForwardings=yes mymachine  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    357   The –L option specifies a forwarding, but ClearAllForwardings cancels it. This silly command is identical in function to:  $ ssh mymachine  ClearAllForwardings may also be placed in your client configuration file, of course. It seems more useful on the command line, however, where it can be used on the fly without editing a file.  Comparing Local and Remote Port Forwarding  9.2.3 The differences between local and remote forwarding can be subtle. It can get a bit confusing to know which kind of forwarding to use in a given situation. The quick rule is look for the TCP client application.  If the TCP client application  whose connections you want to for- ward  is running locally on the SSH client machine, use local forward- ing. Otherwise, the client application is on the remote SSH server machine, and you use remote forwarding.  The rest of this section is devoted to dissecting the forwarding process in detail and understanding where this rule comes from.  Common elements  9.2.3.1 Local and remote forwarding can be confusing because of overloaded terminology. In a given port-forwarding situation, there are two clients and two servers lying around. We have the SSH client and server programs  e.g., ssh and sshd , plus the TCP application’s client and server programs whose connection you want to protect by port forwarding.  An SSH session has a direction of establishment. That is, you run an SSH client on one machine, and it initiates a session with an SSH server on another. Likewise, a forwarded connection has a direction of establishment: you run an application client on one machine, and it initiates a session with a service on another. These two direc- tions may or may not match. This is the difference between local and remote for- warding. Let’s introduce some terminology and provide some diagrams to make sense of this.  To begin with, we have an application client and server running on two hosts, A and B  Figure 9-2 .  The application server is listening on a well-known port W for incoming client con- nections. Without SSH, you can tell the application client that its server is on host B, port W. The client makes a direct connection to the server, and all application proto- col data goes in the clear over the network  Figure 9-3 .  358    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Application client and server  Host A  Host B  server B:W  application  client  W  application  server  TCP  TCP  Figure 9-3. Direct client server connection  no forwarding   To protect the application protocol data by forwarding, you establish an SSH ses- sion between these two hosts. When setting up the SSH session, you select an unused port number P on the application client side  host A , and request SSH port forwarding from the socket  A,P  to the socket  B,W . Once the session is estab- lished, the SSH process on A is listening for incoming TCP connection requests on port P. Tell the application client that its server is on  A,P  instead of  B,W , and the stage is now set for port forwarding  Figure 9-4 .  There are now two cooperating SSH processes with an established, encrypted SSH session between them; you don’t distinguish between the SSH client and server. Inside that session, SSH creates multiple channels, or logical streams for carrying data. It uses channels to carry and distinguish the input, output, and error streams for an interactive login or remote command run via SSH, and similarly creates a new channel for each use of a port forwarding, to carry the forwarded data inside the pro- tected SSH session.

A forwarded port  Figure 9-5 shows that now, when the application client tries to connect to its server, it connects instead to the listening SSH process  1 . The SSH listener notices this and accepts the connection. It then notifies its partner SSH process that a new instance of this port forwarding is starting up, and they cooperate to establish a new channel for carrying the data for this forwarding instance  2 . Finally, the partner SSH process initiates a TCP connection to the target of the port forwarding: the application server listening on  B,W   3 . Once this connection succeeds, the port-forwarding instance is in place. The SSH processes cooperate to pass back and forth any data transmitted by the application client and server, over the channel inside the SSH session. This allows them to communicate and secures the application’s activities on the network.

A forwarded connection  Local versus remote forwarding: the distinction  9.2.3.2 With this general framework in place, you can distinguish between local and remote forwarding. First we introduce some terms. In the generic port-forwarding descrip- tion in the last section, you saw that one SSH process listens for connections, while the other is ready to initiate connections in response to connections accepted on the  360    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   other side, to complete the forwarded path. We call the first side the listening side of the SSH session with respect to this forwarding, and the other, the connecting side. For example, in Figure 9-4, host A is the listening side, while host B is the connect- ing side. Note that these terms aren’t mutually exclusive. Since a single SSH session may have multiple forwardings in place, the same side of a session may be the listen- ing side for some forwardings, and simultaneously the connecting side for others. But with respect to any particular forwarding, it’s one or the other.  Now, recall that in the last section we didn’t label the SSH processes according to which was the SSH client and which was the SSH server, but simply referred to two cooperating SSH processes. We do so now and can state succinctly the local versus remote distinction:    In a local forwarding  Figure 9-6 , the application client and hence the listening side are located with the SSH client. The application server and connecting side are located with the SSH server.    In a remote forwarding  Figure 9-7 , the situation is reversed: the application cli- ent and listening side are located with the SSH server, while the application server and connecting side are located with the SSH client.  Host A  Host B  application  client  SSH Client  application  server  SSH Server  SSH  TCP  TCP  Figure 9-6. Local forwarding  So, as we said at the beginning of this section: use a local forwarding when the appli- cation client is on the local side of the SSH connection, and a remote forwarding when it’s on the remote side.  Forwarding Off-Host  9.2.4 In all our discussions of port forwarding so far, the application client and server have been located on the machines on the ends of the SSH session. This is reflected in our always using “localhost” in naming the target socket of a forwarding:  $ ssh -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    361   Host A  Host B  application  server  SSH Client  application  client  SSH Server  SSH  TCP  TCP  Figure 9-7. Remote forwarding  Since the application server is located on the same machine as the connecting side of the SSH port forwarding, the target host can be “localhost.” But the connections between the application client and the SSH listening side, and between the applica- tion server and the SSH connecting side, are themselves TCP connections. For conve- nience, TCP implementations allow programs to make connections between two sockets on the same host. The connection data is simply transferred from one pro- cess to another without actually being transmitted on any real network interface. However, in principle, either the application client or server—or both—could be on different machines, potentially involving as many as four hosts in a single forward- ing  Figure 9-8 .  Host C  Host S  server A:P  application  client  application  server  W  TCP  TCP  P  SSHClient  Host A  Host B  SSH  SSH Server  “ssh -L P:S:W B”  Figure 9-8. Off-host port forwarding  Although this situation is possible, you generally don’t want to do it for security rea- sons—namely, privacy and access control.  362    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Privacy  9.2.4.1 As shown in Figure 9-8, the complete path followed by forwarded data includes three TCP connections. But only the second connection, between the two SSH pro- cesses, is protected as a channel inside the SSH session. The other two connections are just simple TCP connections. Normally, each of these is on a single host, and is therefore protected from network snooping or interference, so the entire forwarding path is secure. But if either of these two connections is between different hosts, its data is vulnerable in transit.  Access control and the loopback address  9.2.4.2 The other security problem of off-host forwarding concerns the listening side. In short, the listening side of a forwarding has no access control, so intruders may gain access to it. To explain this problem, we must first discuss the loopback address of a host.  In addition to physical network interfaces, a host running IP also has a virtual inter- face called the loopback interface. This is a software construct, not corresponding to any network hardware. Nonetheless, the loopback appears and responds like a real interface. Under Unix, it is often named lo0 and is listed by ifconfig:  $ ifconfig -a ... lo0: flags=849  mtu 8232         inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000  The loopback interface leads back to the host itself. A datagram “transmitted” on the loopback interface immediately appears as an incoming packet on the loopback interface and is picked up and processed by IP as being destined for the local host.  The loopback interface is always assigned the same IP address—127.0.0.1, the loop- back address*—and the local naming service provides the name “localhost” for that address. This mechanism gives a reliable way for processes to communicate with one another on the local host via IP, regardless of what IP addresses the host may have on real connected networks, or indeed if the host has no real network connections at all. You can always refer to your local host using the well-known loopback address.  By design, a loopback address is local to its host. One machine can’t contact the loopback address of another. Since the loopback address 127.0.0.1 is standard on all IP hosts, any connection to 127.0.0.1 leads a machine to talk to itself.  Plus, the loopback network isn’t routed on the Internet.   * Actually, the entire network 127.0.0.0 8—comprising 24 million addresses—is reserved for addresses that refer to the local host. Only the address 127.0.0.1 is commonly used, although we have seen devices use a handful of others for special purposes, such as “reject” interfaces on a terminal server or router.

All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    363   Listening on  “binding”  an interface  9.2.4.3 When a host listens on a TCP port, it establishes a potential endpoint for a TCP con- nection. But the endpoints of a TCP connection are sockets, and a socket is an  address,port  pair, not a  host,port  pair. Listening must take place on a particular socket and thus be associated with a particular address, hence a particular interface on the host. This is called binding the interface.* Unless otherwise specified, when asked to listen on a particular port, TCP binds all the host’s interfaces and accepts connections on any of them. This is generally the right behavior for a server. It doesn’t care how many network interfaces the local host has: it just accepts any con- nection made to its listening port, regardless of which host address was requested.  Consider, however, what this means in the case of SSH port forwarding. There is no authentication or access control at all applied to the listening side of a forwarding; it simply accepts any connection and forwards it. If the listening side binds all the host’s interfaces for the forwarded port, this means that anyone with network con- nectivity to the listening host—possibly the whole Internet—can use your forward- ing. This is obviously not a good situation. To address it, SSH by default binds only the loopback address for the listening side of a forwarding. This means that only other programs on the same host may connect to the forwarded socket. This makes it reasonably safe to use port forwarding on a PC or other single-user machine, but is still a security problem on multiuser hosts. On most Unix machines, for example, a knowledgeable user can connect to any listening sockets and see what’s on them. Keep this in mind when using port forwarding on a Unix machine!  If you want to allow off-host connections to your forwarded ports, you can use the –g switch or GatewayPorts option to have the listening side bind all interfaces, as we did in an earlier example: [9.2.4]  $ ssh -g -L P:S:W B  But be aware of the security implications! You may want to exercise more control over the use of forwarded ports in this situation by using TCP-wrappers, which we discuss later in this chapter.  Bypassing a Firewall  9.2.5 Let’s tackle a more complicated example of port forwarding. Figure 9-9 returns us to the same company situation as in Figure 6-5, when we discussed agent forwarding. [6.3.5] Your home machine H talks to work machine W via a bastion host, B, and you want to access your work email from home. Machine W runs an IMAP server, and your home machine H has an IMAP-capable email reader, but you can’t hook them up. Your home IMAP client expects to make a TCP connection directly to the IMAP server on W, but unfortunately that connection is blocked by the firewall. Since host B is  * Named after the Berkeley sockets library routine bind, commonly used to establish the association.  364    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   inside the firewall, and it’s running an SSH server, there should be some way to put all the pieces together and make the IMAP connection from H to W.  H  mail reader  2001 SSH Client  Internet  SSH  B  Corporate Network W  IMAP  mail server  143  SSH Server  Figure 9-9. Port forwarding through a firewall  Port forwarding can solve this problem. As before, the IMAP server is on port 143, and we select a random local port number, 2001. This time, however, we use a slightly different command to set up forwarding:   Executed on home machine H $ ssh -L2001:W:143 B  This establishes an interactive SSH session from home machine H to bastion host B and also creates an SSH tunnel from local host H to the email server machine W. Spe- cifically, in response to a connection on port 2001, the local SSH client directs the SSH server running on B to open a connection to port 143 on W, that is, socket W:143. The SSH server can do this because B is inside the firewall. If you configure your email reader to connect to local port 2001, as before, the communication path is now as follows:  1. The email reader on home machine H sends data to local port 2001. 2. The local SSH client reads port 2001, encrypts the data, and sends it into the  3. The tunnel passes through the firewall, because it is an SSH connection  port 22   tunnel.  that the firewall accepts.  4. The SSH server on bastion host B decrypts the data and sends it to port 143 on work machine W. This transmission isn’t encrypted, but it’s protected behind the firewall, so encryption isn’t necessary.  Assuming you’re not worried about snooping on your internal network.   5. Data is sent back from the IMAP server to home machine H by the same process  in reverse.  You have now bypassed the firewall by tunneling the IMAP traffic through SSH.

All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    365   Port Forwarding Without a Remote Login  9.2.6 It may happen that you’d like to forward a port via SSH but don’t want an SSH login session to the remote host. For example, if you’re using the IMAP forwarding exam- ple we’ve been harping on, you may want only to read email, not open an unneces- sary terminal connection at the same time. With Tectia, this is simple: just provide the –f option to ssh in your port-forwarding command:   Tectia $ ssh -f -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  or use the GoBackground keyword for the same effect:   Tectia GoBackground yes  As a result, ssh puts itself into the background and handles connections to the for- warded port 2001, and that is all. It doesn’t create an interactive terminal session with standard input, output, and error channels. The –S option also avoids starting a terminal session, but unlike –f, it doesn’t put the session in the background  in other words, the –f option implies –S :   Tectia $ ssh -S -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  The –f option is also supported by OpenSSH, but by default it still requires a com- mand to execute. This usage is intended more for executing remote commands that don’t require terminal interaction, such as graphical programs using X. Specifically, it causes the backgrounded ssh to connect the local end of the terminal session to  dev  null  that is, –f implies the –n option .  For example, if X forwarding is turned on  which we’ll discuss later , the following command puts itself into the background, popping up a graphical clock on your local display, with the clock program running on the remote host zwei.uhr.org:    OpenSSH $ ssh -f zwei.uhr.org xclock  This is similar to the background command:    OpenSSH $ ssh -n zwei.uhr.org xclock &  but –f is better because it performs any needed user interaction—like prompting for a password—before forking into the background. If you want to background an OpenSSH session without a remote command, as with Tectia earlier, then add the –N switch as well:  $ ssh -f -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  Technically, this means the client will not create a “shell channel” in the SSH proto- col. Tectia doesn’t require the extra option, it just does the right thing whether you give a remote command or not; with OpenSSH, you must use the –N option if you don’t provide a command. If you forget the option, you’ll see:  366    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     OpenSSH $ ssh -f -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com Cannot fork into background without a command to execute.  The old SSH-1 protocol always requires the remote command, so as a workaround, provide one that does nothing for a long time, such as sleep:    An SSH-1 client $ ssh -f -L2001:localhost:143 server.example.com sleep 1000000  9.2.6.1 One-shot forwarding When invoked with –f or GoBackground, ssh persists until you explicitly kill it with the Unix kill command.  You can find its pid with the ps command.  Alternatively, you can request one-shot forwarding, which causes the client to exit when forwarding is over with. Specifically, the client waits indefinitely for the first forwarded connec- tion. After that, when the number of forwarded connections drops to zero, the client exits.  One-shot forwarding is accomplished easily in Tectia with the -fo command-line option, a variation on –f  the “o” stands for “one shot” .   Tectia $ ssh -fo -L2001:localhost:143 server  One-shot forwarding isn’t directly supported by OpenSSH, but you can get the same effect with the following method:  1. Set up the forwarding with ssh -f, and for the required remote command, use  sleep with a short duration:  $ ssh -f -L2001:localhost:143 server sleep 10  2. Before the sleep interval expires, use the forwarded connection:  $ ssh -p2001 localhost  Once the sleep command finishes, the first ssh tries to exit—but it notices a for- warded connection is in use and refuses to exit, printing a warning you can ignore:  Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate... The following connections are open:   port 2001, connection from localhost port 143  ssh waits until that connection ends, and then terminates, providing the behavior of one-shot forwarding.  The Listening Port Number  9.2.7 Earlier, we suggested selecting any unused port for the listening side of a forwarding. Port numbers are encoded in a 16-bit field and can have any value from 1 to 65535  port 0 is reserved . On multiuser operating systems such as Unix, ports 1 through 1023 are called privileged and are reserved for processes run by the superuser  user  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    367   ID zero . If a nonprivileged process tries to bind a privileged port for listening, it fails with an error message such as “insufficient permission.”*  When setting up the listening side of a tunnel, you generally must select a port num- ber between 1024 and 65535, inclusive. This is because an SSH program running under your user ID, not the superuser’s, is responsible for listening on that port. If SSH reports that your chosen port is already in use, just choose another; it shouldn’t be hard to find a free one.  For the target side of the tunnel, you can specify any port number, privileged or not. You are attempting to connect to the port, not listen on it. In fact, most of the time the target side is a privileged port, since the most common TCP services have ports in the privileged range.  If you are the superuser on a machine with SSH clients, you can perform local for- warding with a privileged port. Likewise, you can forward a remote privileged port if your remote account has superuser privileges.  Some TCP applications hardcode the server port numbers and don’t permit them to be changed. These applications aren’t usable with port forwarding if the operating system has a privileged port restriction. For example, suppose you have an FTP cli- ent that’s hardwired to connect to the server on the standard FTP control port, 21. To set up port forwarding, you have to forward the local port 21 to the remote port 21. But since port 21 is privileged, you can’t use it as a listening port number unless you are the superuser. Fortunately, most Unix TCP-based programs let you set the destination port number for connections.  Choosing the Target Forwarding Address  9.2.8 Suppose you want to forward a connection from your local machine to remote.host. net. Both of the following commands work:  $ ssh -L2001:localhost:143 remote.host.net $ ssh -L2001:remote.host.net:143 remote.host.net  The forwarded connection is made from the remote machine to either the loopback address or remote.host.net, and in either case, the connection stays on the remote machine and doesn’t go over the network. However, the two connections are percep- tibly different to the server receiving the forwarded connection. This is because the source sockets of the connections are different. The connection to localhost appears to come from source address 127.0.0.1, whereas the connection to remote.host.net is from the address associated with that name.  Most of the time this difference doesn’t matter, but sometimes you must take it into account. The application server  e.g., the IMAP daemon  might be doing access control based on the source address and may not be configured to accept the loop-  * Microsoft Windows has no privileged port restriction, so any user can listen on any free port.  368    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   back address. Or it might be running on a multihomed host, and have bound only a subset of the addresses the host has, possibly not including the loopback address. Each of these situations is usually an oversight, but you might not be able to do any- thing about it. If you’re getting “connection refused” from the connecting side of the forwarding, but you’ve verified that the server appears to be running and responding to normal clients, this might be the problem. If the server machine is running Unix, the command netstat -a -n should list all the network connections and listeners on that machine. Look for listeners on the relevant port, and the addresses on which they are listening. Sometimes, the problem can be more acute if the server uses the source IP address itself as part of whatever protocol it’s speaking. This problem crops up when trying to forward FTP over SSH. [11.2]  In general, we recommend using localhost as the forwarding target whenever possi- ble. This way, you are less likely to set up an insecure off-host forwarding by accident.  Termination  9.2.9 What happens to forwardings when an SSH connection terminates? The ports sim- ply cease being forwarded; that is, SSH is no longer listening on them, and connec- tion attempts to those ports will fail with the error “connection refused.”  What happens if you try to terminate an SSH session while it still has active for- warded connections? SSH notices and waits for them to disconnect before stopping the session. The details of this behavior differ among implementations.  In Tectia, if you log out of a session that has an active forwarded connection, the ses- sion stays open but sends itself into the background:  remote$ logout warning: ssh[7021]: number of forwarded channels still open, forked to background to wait for completion. local$  The ssh process now waits in the background until the forwarded connections termi- nate, and then it exits. In contrast, with OpenSSH, if you disconnect a session with active forwardings, you get a warning, but the session stays in the foreground:  remote$ logout Waiting for forwarded connections to terminate... The following connections are open:   port 2002, connection from localhost port 1465  To send it into the background and return to your local shell prompt, type the escape sequence Return-tilde-ampersand: [7.4.6.8]    ~& [backgrounded]   local$  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    369   and as with Tectia, the connection exits only after its forwarded connections termi- nate. Be careful not to use the SSH ^Z escape for this purpose. That sends ssh into the background, but in a suspended state, unable to accept TCP connections to its for- warded ports. If you do this accidentally, use your shell’s job control commands  e.g., fg and bg  to resume the process.  The TIME_WAIT problem  9.2.9.1 Sometimes a forwarded port mysteriously hangs around after the forwarding SSH session has gone away. You try a command you’ve used successfully several times in a row and suddenly get an error message:  $ ssh -L2001:localhost:21 server.example.com Local: bind: Address already in use   This happens commonly if you’re experimenting with port forwarding, trying to get something to work.  You know that you have no active SSH command listening on port 2001, so what’s going on? If you use the netstat command to look for other lis- teners on that port, you may see a connection hanging around in the TIME_WAIT state:  $ netstat -an  grep 2001 tcp    0   0   127.0.0.1:2001   127.0.0.1:1472    TIME_WAIT  The TIME_WAIT state is an artifact of the TCP protocol. In certain situations, the teardown of a TCP connection can leave one of its socket endpoints unusable for a short period of time, usually only a few minutes. As a result, you can’t reuse the port for TCP forwarding  or anything else  until the teardown completes. If you’re impa- tient, choose another port for the time being  say, 2002 instead of 2001  and get on with your work, or wait a short time for the port to become usable again.  Conﬁguring Port Forwarding in the Server  9.2.10 We’ve seen several keywords and command-line options for configuring SSH clients for port forwarding, such as –L and –R. In addition, the SSH server can be config- ured for port forwarding. We’ll cover compile-time, serverwide, and per-account configuration.  9.2.10.1 Compile-time conﬁguration You can enable or disable port forwarding at compile time in Tectia with configure. [4.3.5.5] The Tectia flag --disable-tcp-port-forwarding disables port forwarding for both clients and servers.  9.2.10.2 Serverwide conﬁguration Port forwarding can be globally enabled or disabled in sshd. This is done with the serverwide configuration keyword AllowTcpForwarding in  etc sshd_config. The  370    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   keyword may have the value yes  the default, enabling forwarding  or no  disabling forwarding :  AllowTcpForwarding no  In addition, Tectia has the following options:   Tectia AllowTcpForwardingForUsers AllowTcpForwardingForGroups  The syntax of these is the same as for the AllowUsers and AllowGroups options. [5.5.1] They specify a list of users or groups that are allowed to use port forwarding; the server refuses to honor port-forwarding requests for anyone else. Note that these refer to the target account of the SSH session, not the client username  which is often not known .  9.2.10.3 Per-account conﬁguration In your account, you can disable port forwarding for any client that connects via a particular key. [8.2.7] For OpenSSH, locate the public key in your authorized_keys file and precede it with the option no-port-forwarding:  or for Tectia, follow the Key line with an Options line:   OpenSSH no-port-forwarding ...key...   Tectia Key mykey.pub Options no-port-forwarding  Any SSH client that authenticates using this key can’t perform port forwarding with your SSH server. Nevertheless, the earlier remarks we made about serverwide port- forwarding configuration apply here: the restriction isn’t really meaningful unless you further restrict what this key is allowed to do.  9.2.11 Protocol-Speciﬁc Forwarding: FTP SSH port forwarding works best with protocols that make simple use of TCP: those which operate over a single TCP connection and are not sensitive to its network- related details such as IP addresses or ports—in other words, they could operate just as well over a serial line or other similar path. Many common protocols fall in this category, but not all. The exceptions tend to be older protocols designed before the rise of firewalls and NAT on the Internet, which degrade true peer-to-peer connectiv- ity and make some techniques problematic. As we have already mentioned, a prime example is FTP, which exhibits several forwarding problems all at once:    It uses multiple TCP connections.   They may go in different directions.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.2 Port Forwarding    371     The destination ports may be dynamically determined.   It carries TCP port numbers and IP addresses inside the protocol.  This is all pretty disastrous from a forwarding perspective in the presence of NAT, and we’ll share those gory details later. [11.2.6] Some SSH implementations, though, have an FTP-specific forwarding feature designed to work around these problems. This protocol-specific forwarding involves the SSH client watching the tunneled FTP protocol as it operates, creating dynamic forwardings to accommodate it, and possi- bly altering some FTP messages as they pass through in order to accommodate this hacking. Tectia has an FTP forwarding mode, while OpenSSH doesn’t. The Tectia usage is:   Tectia $ ssh -L ftp 2001:localhost:21 S  This logs into server S, forwarding local port 2001 with the FTP workaround magic, to the FTP server running on S  the normal FTP control port is 21 . To use the for- warding, point your FTP client at localhost:2001. FTP programs vary in syntax for this; some examples are:  $ ftp localhost 2001 $ ftp -P 2001 localhost  As long as the FTP and SSH clients are together on one host, the servers are together on another, and “localhost” is used as shown in the commands, both active and pas- sive FTP now work. This is normally the way you want it, since if the clients or serv- ers are split up, then FTP data transfers  which include directory listings  pass in the clear over a portion of the path, unprotected by SSH. However, in some circum- stances you might be forced to split one side up. As a result of the way Tectia FTP forwarding works, the rule is:  In active mode, the servers must be together; in passive mode, the cli- ents must be together.  Observe that if you split up both sides so that four separate hosts  technically, addresses  are in the picture, then neither mode works, and FTP won’t work at all beyond the initial connection and login.  This rule applies because when Tectia forwards ports to accommodate FTP data con- nections, the ports listen on the loopback address only, forcing both participants on one side or the other to be on the same host. Which side depends on which mode: in active mode the FTP server makes the data connections, so the SSH forwardings are remote, forcing the servers to be together. In passive mode, the FTP client makes the connections, so the SSH forwardings are local, forcing the clients to be together.  372    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

The SSH port forwarding we’ve described so far doesn’t meet this need very well, but there is another flavor called dynamic port forwarding which does. We’ll call the previous technique “static for- warding” in contrast.  Suppose you’re at home, using your home machine H, and need to access a web server W1 at work, but your employer’s internal network is behind a firewall. You might attempt to do this through a bastion server at work  say, B  which you can log into via SSH; and then from B, you can reach whatever internal web servers you want. So you create a tunnel using the following port-forwarding command on home machine H:  $  ssh -L 8080:W1:80 B  This runs into problems  and point your web browser on H at http:  localhost:8080 . This is a reasonable try, based on forwarding as we’ve seen it so far, but there are lots of problems:  Problem 1: virtual hosts  Web servers can make decisions based on the hostname portion of the URL you request. For example, if the names foo and bar are aliases for the same host, then the URLs http:  foo  and http:  bar  may return different pages. A practical exam- ple is an ISP’s web server, which could host content for dozens or hundreds of customers’ web sites under different hostnames, all of which point to that same machine. This web server configuration is often called virtual hosts. In our home work example, we’re trying to access web server W1 as “local- host,” but it might not be configured to serve any content under this name; and even if it does, it might not be the content you want. To address this problem, you’d have to get the browser to recognize other names as aliases for localhost, e.g., by hacking  etc hosts on a Unix box—not exactly a smooth solution.  Problem 2: absolute links  Suppose problem 1 is a non-issue, and you see the web page you want. How- ever, if that web page has any absolute links that directly reference the host- name W1, they might not work. For example, the absolute URL http:  W1 some_ great_content.html fails when your browser tries to follow it, because your browser knows the site only as localhost.  Problem 3: links to other secured servers  Even if problems 1 and 2 don’t bite you, your luck runs out when you hit a link to another internal web server, W2, or even a page on the same server but on a different port  e.g., http:  W1:81 java-is-great.jsp .  Clearly, static port forwarding is woefully inadequate for this scenario. You could get around individual problems by editing your host file or stopping now and then to  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.3 Dynamic Port Forwarding    373   forward another port, but who wants the annoyance? And such a burdensome solu- tion isn’t exactly convenient to explain to your Aunt Mae. Or your boss.  We can address problems 1 and 2 by making a realization: that we want to redirect the web browser over SSH without fussing with the URL. Most browsers have just such a feature: a proxy. We can set the browser’s HTTP proxy to our SSH-forwarded port localhost:8080; this means it always connects to our forwarded port in response to any HTTP URL we provide. The browser assumes this port leads to a proxy server that knows how to get the content for the various web servers we seek, so the browser doesn’t have to contact those servers directly.  Proxying gets us part of the way there, but doesn’t solve problem 3: what happens if we hit a link to a hostname besides W1? The browser sends it to W1 anyway via its proxy setting, but W1 won’t know how to handle it, so we’ll get a web server error along the lines of “unrecognized URL.” We can’t feasibly deal with this manually; not only would we have to forward another port, but also we’d have to reset the browser to proxy through the new port, at which point it could reach the new URLs but not the old ones on W1! That’s just a mess...what we really need is a way for the browser to communicate dynamically with SSH itself, telling it to forward to the cor- rect web server for each URL the browser handles. And indeed, there is a feature to do exactly this, called dynamic forwarding or SOCKS forwarding.  SOCKS is a small protocol, defined in RFC-1928. A SOCKS client connects via TCP, and indicates via the protocol the remote socket it wants to reach; the SOCKS server makes the connection, then gets out of the way, transparently passing data back and forth. Thereafter, it is just as if the client had connected directly to the remote socket. The OpenSSH and Tectia syntax for this kind of forwarding would be:   OpenSSH $ ssh -D 1080 B   Tectia $ ssh -L socks 1080 B  We’ve switched to port 1080 since that’s the usual SOCKS port; 8080 or any other port would do, as usual. Note that there’s no destination socket in either command, just the local port to be forwarded; that’s because the destination is determined dynamically, and can be different for each connection. We can use this solution only if the browser has an option to use a SOCKS proxy  as most do .  This solves the whole problem neatly! The process goes like so:  1. The user types URL scheme:  foo:1234  into the browser. The port 1234 might be  implicit, as in 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS.  2. The browser connects to the SSH SOCKS proxy on localhost:1080, and asks for  a connection to foo:1234 using the SOCKS protocol.  374    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3. In response, the SSH client associates the browser’s connection with a new direct-tcpip channel in the existing SSH session [3.4.4.1], connected to foo:1234 via another TCP connection established by the SSH server.  4. The SSH client and server “get out of the way,” and the browser is connected to the desired web server. Note that there is nothing here specific to HTTP; the browser can next build an SSL session if the scheme is HTTPS, or use any proto- col at all over the proxied connection.  Each time a new connection arrives on port 1080, it can be forwarded to a different socket. This might seem odd if you have static forwarding firmly in mind, but it’s just an extension of what you already know. With static forwarding, the SSH client still creates a new channel for each connection; it just sends them all to the same place. With dynamic forwarding, SOCKS allows each connection to indicate its own destination, and SSH obliges.  No special support is required for dynamic forwarding on the SSH server, since it in fact uses the same mechanism as static forwarding. Only the client needs to support dynamic forwarding.  So, this would be a perfect lightweight solution: complete remote web browsing with just SSH. Ah, if only we lived in such a simple world....  SOCKS v4, SOCKS v5, and Names  9.3.1 There are actually two commonly used versions of the SOCKS protocol: Version 4 and Version 5. Both OpenSSH and Tectia clients can do SOCKS proxying, and recent versions implement SOCKS5 as well as SOCKS4. SOCKS5 added many fea- tures over SOCKS4—authentication, UDP support, bidirect forwarding, and more— but the germane feature here is that SOCKS4 only understands IP addresses in desti- nation sockets, whereas SOCKS5 accepts domain names as well. This is crucial for both practical and privacy reasons. Often, the naming context on either side of the SSH connection is different: in our current example, your company’s network proba- bly has a private namespace for hosts  e.g., an internal-only DNS which isn’t avail- able to the outside world . With SOCKS4, your browser must look up the name in the URL locally, then ask the SOCKS proxy to connect to the resulting address. That won’t work for us; we want to give the proxy the  name,port  to reach, and have it resolve the name on the far side of the connection, in the correct context.  The privacy aspect is, if you’re proxying your browsing traffic to shield your local web traffic from prying eyes, you don’t want to reveal the names of all the web serv- ers you’re hitting to anyone who can watch the DNS traffic from your browsing host.  OK, so SOCKS4 is out; that’s no problem, as many browsers support SOCKS5. But there’s a further complication; the ugly face of reality nosing into our elegant solu- tion. Disappointingly, most of the major browsers, even when they support SOCKS5, don’t actually use it properly: they look up names locally, even though  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.3 Dynamic Port Forwarding    375   they could be passed through the proxy. We’ve tried dozens of OS browser combi- nations, including Firefox, Safari, Netscape, Mozilla, Internet Explorer  IE , and Opera, and the only one we’ve found so far which does the right thing is... drum roll please...  IE 5.2 on Macintosh OS X. We guess that the main motivation for adding SOCKS5 support was authentication, and so it was added without changing the address-lookup logic—but this is an oversight that makes any use of SOCKS5 proxy- ing much less useful than it could be. So: write your browser developers and ask for better SOCKS5 support! A switch for choosing either local or remote name resolu- tion would be ideal.  Given the realities of browser SOCKS support, the best solution for now is usually using a static SSH port forwarding to a separate HTTP proxy server, such as Squid or Privoxy. These proxies can also provide lots of other useful features, such as pop-up blocking and cookie management—but one doesn’t always have such a proxy avail- able or the ability to set one up, so the SSH-only approach with dynamic forwarding is preferable if you can use it.  Other Uses of Dynamic Forwarding  9.3.2 The remote web-browsing problem provided a perfect setting in which to introduce dynamic forwarding, but there are certainly other uses. Any program which can use a SOCKS proxy is a candidate, and there are lots of them if you look. For instance: SSH itself! With dynamic forwarding, SSH acts as a SOCKS server, but as a com- pletely separate feature, some SSH products can also be SOCKS clients. The usual use for this is for external connectivity where the local network isn’t directly con- nected to the Internet, but provides only proxied Net access via SOCKS. However, it has a neat use in combination with dynamic forwarding:   Tectia  In one window: $ ssh -L socks 1080 B  In another window: $ export SSH_SOCKS_SERVER=socks:  localhost:1080  $ ssh -o'usesocks5 yes' HOST1  where you’re on the outside but HOST1 is on your company’s internal network. The second ssh command uses the SSH SOCKS proxy established by the first to connect through the bastion host B to HOST1, resolving the name HOST1 on the inside. This is obviously more convenient than forwarding a separate port to host:22 for each internal host you might want to reach. It also has many advantages over the idiom ssh B -t ssh HOST1, including:    It’s faster, since multiple subsequent SSH commands to internal hosts use the same SSH SOCKS connection, rather than waiting for two connections every time.  376    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     It doesn’t require an SSH client or other state  keys, known-hosts files, etc.  on bastion host B. Indeed, this technique could work were a shell login not allowed on B, only SSH connections for forwarding purposes.    There is an SSH connection directly between home machine H and HOST1, which simplifies things immensely if you want to do X forwarding or port for- warding between them.  X Forwarding  9.4 Now that you’ve seen general TCP port forwarding, we move to a new topic: for- warding of X protocol connections. X is a popular window system for Unix worksta- tions, and one of its best features is its transparency. Using X, you can run remote X applications that open their windows on your local display  and vice versa, running local applications on remote displays . Unfortunately, the inter-machine communi- cation is insecure and wide open to snoopers. But there’s good news: SSH X forward- ing makes the communication secure by tunneling the X protocol.  X forwarding also addresses some firewall-related difficulties. Suppose you’re a sys- tem administrator with a set of exposed production machines on the other side of a firewall from you. You log into one of these machines using SSH, and want to run a graphical performance-monitoring tool, such as Solaris’s perfmon, that uses the X Window System. You can’t, though, because to do that, the external machine needs to make a TCP connection back to the internal machine you started on, and the fire- wall blocks it  as it should, since X is quite insecure . X forwarding solves this prob- lem, permitting X protocol connections to pass through the firewall, securely tunneled via SSH.  Our discussion begins with a brief overview, then explains the details of X forward- ing. In addition to explaining how to use X forwarding, we also expose the internals of X authentication and how it interacts with SSH, as well as other technical topics.  The X Window System  9.4.1 The X Window System, or X, is the most widely used graphical display system for Unix machines. Like SSH, X has clients and servers. X clients are windowing applica- tion programs, such as terminal emulators, paint programs, graphical clocks, and so forth. An X server is the underlying display engine that processes requests from X cli- ents, communicating via a network protocol called the X protocol. A machine typi- cally runs a single X server but possibly many X clients.  Most important to our discussion, X supports sophisticated window management over a network. X clients can open windows not only on their local machine, but also on other computers on the network, whether they are down the hall or across the globe. To accomplish this, an X client makes a network connection to a remote X  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.4 X Forwarding    377   VNC Forwarding: An Alternative to X Forwarding  X forwarding is problematic from a security point of view, for the same reason as X itself. As you will see, the design of X means that remote programs must make separate network connections back to the user; this requires yet another layer of authentication and authorization, complicating the situation and opening an avenue of attack. SSH X forwarding tries to secure this as much as possible, but it may still be unacceptable in some environments. An alternative technique is to use Virtual Network Computing  VNC  over SSH. VNC is free software developed by AT&T Laboratories in the UK, which provides remote GUI access for Unix and Windows platforms. With VNC, you can open a window on your Unix machine running X, and have the desktop of a remote Windows machine appear there, so you can operate the Windows box remotely. Conversely, you can run the VNC client on a Windows machine and connect to a remote X display running on a Unix host. Since VNC involves only a single outbound connection, it is easy and safer to tunnel through SSH than X. You can find out more about VNC  and download the software  at http:  www.realvnc.com .  server and carries on a conversation, using the X protocol to draw on the remote screen, receive remote keyboard events, learn the remote mouse location, and so on. This obviously requires some type of security, which we discuss soon.  A central concept of X is the display, an abstraction for the screen managed by an X server. When an X client is invoked, it needs to know which display to use. Displays are named by strings of the form HOST:n.v, where:    HOST is the name of the machine running the X server controlling the display.   n is the display number, an integer, usually 0. X allows for multiple displays con-  trolled by a single server; additional displays are numbered 1, 2, and so on.    v is the visual number, another integer. A visual is a virtual display. X supports multiple virtual displays on a single, physical display. If there’s only one virtual display  which is the most common scenario , you omit the “.v”, and the default is visual 0.  For example, on the machine server.example.com, display 0, visual 1 is represented by the display string “server.example.com:0.1”.  Under Unix, most X client programs let you specify the display string in two ways: the –d or -display command-line option, or the environment variable DISPLAY. For example, to run the X client program xterm on the only X display of the workstation anacreon, use the command-line option:  $ xterm -d anacreon:0 &  378    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   or the environment variable:  $ setenv DISPLAY anacreon:0 $ xterm &  X is a large, deep software product whose documentation fills a dozen O’Reilly books. We’ve barely scratched the surface with our explanation, but you’ve now seen enough to understand X forwarding.  How X Forwarding Works  9.4.2 Although X clients can communicate with remote X servers, this communication isn’t secure. All interactions between the X client and server, such as keystrokes and displayed text, can be easily monitored by network snooping because the connec- tion isn’t encrypted. In addition, most X environments use primitive authentication methods for connecting to a remote display. A knowledgeable attacker can get a con- nection to your display, monitor your keystrokes, and control other programs you’re running.  Once again, SSH comes to the rescue. An X protocol connection can be routed through an SSH connection to provide security and stronger authentication. This fea- ture is called X forwarding.  X forwarding works in the following way, as illustrated in Figure 9-10. An SSH client requests X forwarding when it connects to an SSH server  assuming X forwarding is enabled in the client . If the server allows X forwarding for this connection, your login proceeds normally, but the server takes some special steps behind the scenes. In addition to handling your terminal session, it sets itself up as a proxy X server run- ning on the remote machine and sets the DISPLAY environment variable in your remote shell to point to the proxy X display:  syrinx$ ssh sys1 Last login: Sat Nov 13 01:10:37 1999 from blackberry Sun Microsystems Inc.   SunOS 5.6       Generic August 1997 You have new mail. sys1$ echo $DISPLAY sys1:10.0 sys1$ xeyes The “xeyes” X client appears on the screen  The DISPLAY value appears to refer to X display 10 on sys1, but there’s no such dis- play.  In fact, there might be no true displays on sys1 at all!  Instead, the DISPLAY value points to the X proxy established by the SSH server, i.e., the SSH server is mas- querading as an X server. If you now run an X client program, it connects to the proxy. The proxy behaves just like a “real” X server, and in turn instructs the SSH client to behave as a proxy X client, connecting to the X server on your local machine. The SSH client and server then cooperate to pass X protocol information back and forth over the SSH pipe between the two X sessions, and the X client  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

A  display hardware  X server  port 6000   DISPLAY A:0   B  X client  port 6010   DISPLAY B:10   SSH Client  SSH  SSH Server  Figure 9-10. X forwarding  X forwarding can even solve the firewall problem mentioned earlier, as long as the firewall permits SSH connections to pass through. If a firewall sits between your local and remote machines, and you run an X client on the remote machine, X forwarding tunnels the X connection through the firewall’s SSH port to the local machine. Therefore, the X client’s windows can open on your local display. If X forwarding were not present, the firewall would block the connection. Some aspects of X forwarding probably sound familiar from our earlier explanation of port forwarding. In fact, X forwarding is just a special case of port forwarding for which SSH has special support.  Enabling X Forwarding  9.4.3 X forwarding is on by default. If you need to enable or disable X forwarding for your clients, here’s how to do it. Unlike general port forwarding, which requires you to fiddle with TCP port numbers, X forwarding has only an on off switch. In your SSH client configuration file, use the keyword ForwardX11 with a value of yes  the default, to enable  or no  to disable :  On the command line, you may also use –x to disable X forwarding:  OpenSSH and Tectia enable X forwarding with the following options:  ForwardX11 yes  $ ssh -x server.example.com   OpenSSH $ ssh -X server.example.com   Tectia $ ssh +x server.example.com  380    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Conﬁguring X Forwarding  9.4.4 The behavior of X forwarding can be modified through compile-time configuration, serverwide configuration, and per-account configuration.  Compile-time conﬁguration  9.4.4.1 Tectia can be compiled with or without X support. The compile-time flags --with-x and --without-x make this determination:  $ configure ... --without-x ...  You can also enable or disable all X forwarding by default with --enable-X11- forwarding or --disable-X11-forwarding:   Tectia $ configure ... --enable-X11-forwarding ...  Remember, enable disable flags simply set the default behavior. You can override these defaults with serverwide and per-account configuration.  Serverwide conﬁguration  9.4.4.2 The serverwide configuration keyword X11Forwarding* enables or disables X forward- ing in the SSH server. By default, it is enabled.  The X11DisplayOffset keyword lets you reserve some X11 display numbers so that sshd can’t use them. This keyword specifies the lowest display number SSH may use, preventing sshd from clashing with real X servers on the lower-numbered displays. For example, if you normally run actual X servers on displays 0 and 1, set:  X11Forwarding no    OpenSSH X11DisplayOffset 2  The XAuthLocation keyword specifies the path to the xauth program, which manipu- lates authorization records for X. We describe this keyword later, after we discuss xauth. [9.4.6.4]   OpenSSH XAuthLocation  usr local bin xauth  Per-account conﬁguration  9.4.4.3 In your authorization file for public keys, you may disallow X forwarding for incom- ing SSH connections that use a particular key for authentication.

Now we’re going to dive into technical detail on the inner workings of X authentication, why it’s insecure, and how SSH X forwarding builds on it to create a secure solution.  In most cases, X forwarding simply works, and you don’t have to think about it. The following material is to aid your understanding and satisfy any intense cravings for tech talk  both yours and ours .  9.4.5.1 How X authentication works When an X client requests a connection to an X server, the server authenticates the client. That is, the X server determines the client’s identity to decide whether to allow a connection to the server’s display. The current release of the X Window Sys- tem  X11R6  provides two categories of authentication: host-based and key-based:  Host-based X authentication  The simpler method. Using the program xhost, you indicate a list of hosts that may connect to your X display. Notice that connections are authenticated only by hostname, not by username. That is, any user on a listed host may connect to your display.  Key-based X authentication  Uses the xauth program to maintain a list of X authentication keys, or display keys, for X clients. Keys are kept in a file, usually ~ .Xauthority, along with other data associated with the various displays the client wants to access. When an X client connects to a server requiring authentication, the client supplies the appropriate credentials for that display from the xauth data. If authentication is successful, the X client can then connect to the display managed by the X server.  Display keys are obtained from the X server in various ways depending on the envi- ronment. For example, if you start the server directly on the console of a machine using xinit or startx, these programs invoke an X server and insert a copy of the server’s key directly into your xauth data. Alternatively, if you connect to a remote machine that runs the X Display Manager  XDM , the key is sent to your remote account when establishing your XDM session.  xauth and the SSH rc ﬁles  9.4.5.2 SSH has startup files that can be set to execute on the server side when a client logs in. These are the systemwide  etc sshrc and the per-account ~ .ssh rc files. These can be shell scripts or any kind of executable program.  382    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   An important thing to note is that sshd runs xauth only to add the proxy display key if it doesn’t run an rc program. If it does run an rc program, it feeds the key type and data to the program on a single line to its standard input, and it is up to the rc pro- gram to store the display key. This feature provides a way to customize handling the display key, in case just running xauth isn’t the right thing to do in your situation.  Trusted X forwarding  9.4.5.3 The X Windows protocol was not designed with much security in mind. Usually, once an application has access to an X display, it pretty much has the run of it. A malicious X client can easily read all keyboard input, see all screen contents, add or modify keystrokes, and so on. This is why X forwarding is risky and should gener- ally be turned on only when you need it, and only for hosts you trust.  There is a security extension to the X Windows protocol that allows at least some further granularity, partitioning X clients into “trusted” and “untrusted” groups. Pro- grams like the X Window Manager must be trusted, since they have to manipulate the windows of other applications and perform other global operations on the dis- play. Other programs may be left untrusted, though, with more limited access to the display and less opportunity for mischief.  Both OpenSSH and Tectia support this trust distinction in X forwarding. OpenSSH has the ForwardX11Trusted client option and Tectia has TrustX11Applications. Set to yes or no, these keywords control whether remote X clients accessing the local dis- play via SSH X forwarding will be considered trusted or untrusted by the X server.   OpenSSH ForwardX11Trusted yes   Tectia TrustX11Applications yes  The default setting is no, meaning “untrusted.” You can override this setting per con- nection with ssh -Y  OpenSSH  or ssh +X  Tectia :   OpenSSH $ ssh -Y ...   Tectia $ ssh +X ...  Equivalent to ssh -X -o ForwardX11Trusted=yes  Equivalent to ssh +x -o TrustX11Applications=yes  Technically, for trusted forwarding, the client uses the existing xauth key to access the display: that is, it inherits whatever trust is already in effect. For untrusted for- warding it generates a new, specifically untrusted key using the command xauth gen- erated ... untrusted, and uses the new key with forwarded X connections. In either case, the local key never goes to the remote host; that is always a throwaway key used only for authenticating the connection within SSH.

Behind the scenes, however, the mechanism is insecure. Here are the major problems:  xhost is insecure  Once you give permission for a remote host to connect to your display, any user on that host can connect. As with the r-commands, this authentication method depends on the network address of the connecting host, which can be easy for an attacker to usurp.  Key transfer may be manual and insecure  Some remote-login protocols, such as telnet, don’t assist with X authentication. If your display keys aren’t available on a remote machine, you have to transfer them yourself, either manually or by automating the transfer, perhaps in your login script. This isn’t only a nuisance but also insecure, since you’re sending the key in plaintext over the network.  The most common key-based method, MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, is insecure  Although it uses a random string of bits, or cookie, as the xauth display key, this key is transmitted in plaintext at the beginning of every connection, where it can be intercepted and read.  The remote host might not support your chosen X authentication method  X11R6 supports other, more secure authentication methods. SUN-DES-1 employs Sun’s secure RPC system, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 uses DES, and MIT-KERBEROS-5 involves Kerberos user-to-user authentication.* Unfortu- nately, these methods are often not available in particular instances of the X soft- ware. Sometimes they aren’t compiled into X installations due to cryptographic export restrictions; other times, the X version is too old to support the more secure methods.  If the remote host is insecure, your display key can be compromised  In the best scenario, where the X server supports strong authentication and your key can be copied securely to the remote machine, you still have to store your sensitive display key there. If that machine is untrustworthy, your key can be at risk.  SSH doesn’t have this problem, since only your public key is stored on the SSH server machine.   SSH and authentication spooﬁng  9.4.5.5 Through X forwarding, SSH provides transparent, secure authentication and key transfer for X sessions. This is done by a technique called authentication spoofing, as  * See the X11R6 Xsecurity 1  manpage for details on these methods. Also, remember that this is authentication only, not encryption. The contents of your X connection remain unencrypted and open to snooping or mod- ification on the network.  384    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   depicted in Figure 9-11. Authentication spoofing involves a fake display key, which we call the proxy key, that authenticates to the SSH X proxy server on the remote side. When relaying X traffic containing a key, SSH cleverly substitutes the real dis- play key. Here’s how it works.  X Server  real display key  initial X connection  packet  X Client  X  X  X  1  OK 11  ~ .Xauthority  2  10  SSH Client  X  9  swap keys  6  SSH Server  7 SSH  5  xlib  $XAUTHORITY  OK  8  4  xauth add...  proxy display key  3  Figure 9-11. Authentication of forwarded X connections  The players begin in the following positions. You are logged into a local machine with a local display. The local machine runs an X server and SSH clients. On the other side of the network connection, an SSH server is running on a remote machine, where you invoke X clients. The goal is for the remote X clients to appear on your local display by way of SSH.  First, you run a local SSH client, asking it to set up X forwarding. The SSH client requests X forwarding from the remote SSH server, and it also reads your local dis- play key from your .Xauthority file.  Next, the SSH client generates a proxy key. This is a string of random data of the same length as your local display key. The SSH client then sends the proxy key and its key type  e.g., MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  to the remote machine, and the SSH server runs the xauth program on your behalf to associate the proxy key with your local display. The stage is now set for X forwarding.  When you start a remote X client, your local SSH client connects to your local X dis- play. It then watches for the first X protocol message sent over the forwarded con- nection and treats it specially. Specifically, the SSH client parses the message, finds the X authentication key inside it, and compares it to the proxy key. If the keys don’t  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.4 X Forwarding    385   match, the SSH client rejects and closes the connection. Otherwise, if the keys match, the SSH client substitutes the real display key in place of the proxy key and relays the modified message to your local X server. The X server, blissfully unaware that a key switch has taken place, reads the display key and proceeds normally with X authentication. The forwarded X connection is now established.  X forwarding with authentication spoofing solves all but one of the X authentication problems we raised earlier:  xhost  X forwarding doesn’t use xhost.  By the way, make sure to disable all xhost per- missions when using X forwarding, or you’ll undermine the X security provided by SSH.  Key transfer  SSH transfers the X display key automatically and runs xauth on your behalf to install it on the remote side. The transfer is secure since the key travels over the encrypted SSH connection.  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 insecurity  The key transmitted at the beginning of every X session is now encrypted, along with the rest of the X traffic, inside the SSH session. This greatly increases the operational security of this common X authentication scheme.  Untrustworthy remote hosts  With authentication spoofing, only the proxy key, not the true display key, is sent to the remote host. The proxy key is good only for connecting to your dis- play through SSH, not for connecting to your display directly. As soon as your SSH session ends, the proxy key becomes useless. Since SSH sessions come and go, but some people leave their X sessions up  with the same key  for days, X for- warding can be a great improvement.  Improving authentication spooﬁng  9.4.5.6 The remaining problem with X forwarding is the possibility of unsupported X authentication mechanisms. The local side can use a more sophisticated authentica- tion method that a remote host might not support.  In theory, SSH X forwarding can solve this problem by always installing a proxy key of type MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1, no matter what local authentication method is actually in use. After the SSH client has checked the X client’s key against the proxy key for a match, its client could then generate and substitute whatever local authenti- cator is required using the true authentication type and key.  Unfortunately, SSH implementations don’t go this far. The server compares keys liter- ally as bit strings, and the SSH client substitutes keys verbatim, regardless of the key types. As a result, if you use a stronger X authentication method such as XDM- AUTHORIZATION-1, sshd blindly compares an encrypted authenticator with the  386    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   proxy key, rightly determines that they don’t match, and invalidly rejects the connec- tion. The failure is silent and mysterious; we wish the software would detect the pres- ence of an unsupported mode and issue a warning when setting up the connection.  If SSH knew the details of all X authentication modes, it could check the proxy authenticators on one side and generate correct ones for the X server on the other. However, this can be a significant development effort, though perhaps one could link SSH against the X11 libraries to obtain the necessary algorithms. SSH would also have to deal with differing key data lengths, constructing a new X message to hold the proxy key instead of copying it to an existing message.  It would also be useful if X forwarding could be used without authentication spoof- ing. Then you could arrange your own security for the connection by, say, using xhost to allow any connection from your local machine  and hence the SSH X proxy , while still applying key-based authentication to X connections originating from else- where. You can accomplish this with general port forwarding, as discussed in the next section, but direct support is more convenient.  9.4.5.7 Nonstandard X clients X clients generally do X xauth-style authentication by virtue of having been linked against Xlib, the common X programming library. Occasionally, though, you run across particular X client programs that don’t use Xlib and simply ignore authentica- tion issues. Since you can’t turn off SSH X authentication spoofing, you can’t use such programs across SSH X forwarding; you get this message:  X11 connection requests different authentication protocol: 'MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1' vs. ''   You can, however, use a general port forwarding instead. For example:  foo% ssh -R6010:localhost:6000 bar bar% setenv DISPLAY bar:10  Note that this bypasses the discipline imposed by X forwarding, of requiring xauth authentication on forwarded X connections. If your real X server is using xhost for access control, this port forwarding allows anyone on host foo to connect to your X server. Use this sort of thing with caution.  Further Issues  9.4.6 As we’ve said, X forwarding usually works fine without any special effort on your part. In some special situations, however, you might need to take some extra steps.  X server conﬁguration  9.4.6.1 In order for X forwarding to work, your X server must accept the proxy X connec- tions from your SSH client. This is sometimes not set up to begin with, because nor- mal use doesn’t require it. For example, if you’re using an X server on a PC to access  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  9.4 X Forwarding    387   a remote Unix machine via XDM, you might never run local X clients at all, and they may not be allowed by default. You can use xhost +localhost to allow all connections from your PC, while still applying key-based authentication to connections from other sources. This allows SSH-forwarded  and authenticated  connections to be accepted.  Setting your DISPLAY environment variable  9.4.6.2 SSH sets the DISPLAY variable automatically only if X forwarding is in effect. If you don’t use X forwarding but want to use X on a remote machine you logged into via SSH, remember that you have to set the DISPLAY variable yourself. You should really do this only when both machines are on the same, trusted network, as the X proto- col by itself is quite insecure.  Be careful not to set DISPLAY unintentionally! It is common for people to set the DISPLAY variable in a login command file or by other means. If you’re not careful, this can make your X connections insecure without your noticing! If you use SSH to tun- nel through a firewall that blocks normal X connections, then of course you’ll notice because your X clients won’t work. But if normal X connections are possible but undesirable, and X forwarding isn’t in effect, your X programs will work but  silently  not be secured! This is a good reason to block X traffic at the firewall if it presents a security risk or to configure your X server to accept connections only from the local host  the source of the SSH-forwarded X connections . If that’s not feasi- ble, you may want to put something like this in your login script:  ! bin csh if  $?DISPLAY  then    set display_host   = `expr "$DISPLAY" : '\ .*\ :'`    set display_number = `expr "$DISPLAY" : '.*:\ [^.]*\ '`    set my_host = `hostname`    set result  = `expr ' ' "$display_host" = "$my_host" ' ' '&' ' ' \                  "$display_number" '>' "0" ' '`    if  $result == 0  then       echo "WARNING: X display $DISPLAY does not appear to be protected by SSH!"       echo "unsetting DISPLAY variable just to be safe"       unsetenv DISPLAY    endif endif  Shared accounts  9.4.6.3 If you share a single account among multiple people, you may have some trouble with X forwarding. For example, it is common for a group of sysadmins to share use of the root account. For each person to retain their own environment when using the root account, they may set their USER, LOGNAME, and HOME environment variables explicitly to reflect their personal accounts rather than the root account. If you use SSH to log into the root account with X forwarding turned on, though, it adds the proxy xauth key to root’s .Xauthority file before the shell reads your login script and  388    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   resets these environment variables. The result is that once you’re logged in and try to use X, it fails: the X client looks in your .Xauthority file  because of the setting of your HOME variable , but the key isn’t there.  You can deal with this problem by setting the XAUTHORITY variable to point to root’s .Xauthority file, or by using code like the following in your login script to copy the needed key into your personal one:  if   $uid == 0  &&  $?SSH_CLIENT  &&  $?DISPLAY   then  If I do ssh -l root with X forwarding, the X proxy server's xauth key  gets added to root's xauth db, not mine.  See if there's an entry for my  display in root's xauth db...   set key = `bash -c "xauth -i -f  .Xauthority list $DISPLAY 2>  dev null"`  ... and if so, copy it into mine.   if  $? == 0  then     xauth -bi add $key     chown res ~res .Xauthority >&  dev null   endif endif  Location of the xauth program  9.4.6.4 Remember that sshd runs the xauth program on your behalf, to add the proxy key to your .Xauthority file on the remote side. The location of the xauth program is discov- ered when you configure the SSH package and compile into the sshd executable. If xauth is subsequently moved, X forwarding won’t work  ssh -v reveals this explic- itly . For OpenSSH, the system administrator on the server side can use the server- wide configuration keyword XAuthLocation to set the path to the xauth program without having to recompile sshd1:   OpenSSH XAuthLocation  usr local bin xauth  XAuthLocation can also appear in the OpenSSH client configuration file; the client uses xauth to get the local X display key.  X forwarding and the GatewayPorts feature  9.4.6.5 The GatewayPorts  –g  feature discussed earlier applies only to general port forward- ing, not to X forwarding. The X proxies in OpenSSH and Tectia always listen on all network interfaces and accept connections from anywhere, though those connec- tions are then subject to X authentication as described earlier. To restrict X client source addresses, use TCP-wrappers, which we discuss in the next section.  9.5  Forwarding Security: TCP-Wrappers and libwrap  At several points in this chapter, we have talked about security issues and limitations of forwarding. So far, we’ve seen very little control over who can connect to a  9.5 Forwarding Security: TCP-Wrappers and libwrap    389  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   forwarded port. The OpenSSH default is to allow connections only from the local host, which is reasonably secure for a single-user machine. But if you need to allow connections from elsewhere, you have a problem, since it’s all or nothing: to allow connections from elsewhere  using –g or GatewayPorts yes , you must allow them from anywhere. And with Tectia it’s worse: forwarded ports always accept connec- tions from anywhere. X forwarding is in a slightly better position, since the X proto- col has its own authentication, but you might still prefer to restrict access, preventing intruders from exploiting an unknown security flaw or performing a denial-of-service attack. SSH on the Unix platform provides an optional feature for access control based on the client address, called “TCP-wrappers.”  The term “TCP-wrappers” refers to software written by Wietse Venema. If it isn’t already installed in your Unix distribution, you can get it at:  ftp:  ftp.porcupine.org pub security index.html  TCP-wrappers are a global access control mechanism that integrates with other TCP-based servers, such as sshd or telnetd. Access control is based on the source address of incoming TCP connections. That is, a TCP-wrapper permits or denies connections based on their origin, as specified in the configuration files  etc hosts. allow and  etc hosts.deny. Figure 9-12 shows where TCP-wrappers fit into the scheme of SSH configuration.  There are two ways to use TCP-wrappers. The most common method, wrapping, is applied to TCP servers that are normally invoked by inetd. You “wrap” the server by editing  etc inetd.conf and modifying the server’s configuration line. Instead of invok- ing the server directly, you invoke the TCP-wrapper daemon, tcpd, which in turn invokes the original server. Then, you edit the TCP-wrapper configuration files to specify your desired access control. tcpd makes authorization decisions based on the their contents.  The inetd technique applies access control without having to modify the TCP server program. This is nice. However, sshd is usually not invoked by inetd [5.3.3.2], so the second method, source code modification, must be applied. To participate in TCP- wrapper control, the SSH server must be compiled with the flag --with-tcp-wrappers [4.2.4.5] or --with-libwrap [4.3.5.3] to enable internal support for TCP-wrappers. sshd then invokes TCP-wrapper library functions to do explicit access-control checks according to the rules in  etc hosts.allow and  etc hosts.deny. So, in a sense, the term “wrapper” is misleading since sshd is modified, not wrapped, to support TCP- wrappers. Figure 9-13 illustrates the process.  TCP-Wrappers Conﬁguration  9.5.1 The access control language for TCP-wrappers has quite a few options and may vary depending on whose package you use and what version it is. We won’t cover the lan- guage completely in this book.

TCP-wrappers and SSH configuration  highlighted parts   understanding: the manpages on tcpd, hosts_access, and hosts_options. We just indi- cate some simple, common configurations.  The TCP-wrapper configuration is kept in the files  etc hosts.allow and  etc hosts. deny. These files contain patterns of the form:  service_1 [service_2 service_3 ...] : client_1 [client_2 client_3 ...]  Each pattern matches some  server,client  pairs, and hence may match a particular client server TCP connection. Specifically, a connection between client C and server S matches this rule if some service servicei matches S, and some clientj matches C.  We explain the format and matching rules for these subpatterns shortly.  The hosts. allow file is searched first, followed by hosts.deny. If a matching pattern is found in hosts.allow, the connection is allowed. If none is found there, but one matches in hosts.deny, the connection is dropped. Finally, if no patterns match in either file, the connection is allowed. Nonexistence of either file is treated as if the file existed and contained no matching patterns. Note that the default, then, is to allow everything.  9.5 Forwarding Security: TCP-Wrappers and libwrap    391  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

TCP-wrapper  libwrap  operation  There is also an extended syntax, documented on the hosts_options manpage. It may or may not be available, depending on how your TCP-wrapper library was built. It has many more options, but in particular, it allows tagging an individual rule as denying or rejecting a matching connection, for example:  sshd : bad.host.com : DENY  Using this syntax, you can put all your rules into the hosts.allow file, rather than hav- ing to use both files. To reject anything not explicitly allowed, just put ALL : ALL : DENY at the end of the file.  In a pattern, each service is a name indicating a server to which this pattern applies. SSH recognizes the following service names:  The main SSH server. This can be sshd, sshd1, sshd2, or whatever name you invoke the daemon under  its argv[0] value, in C-programmer-speak .  sshd  sshdfwd-x11  sshdfwd-N  The X forwarding port.  Forwarded TCP port N  e.g., forwarded port 2001 is service sshdfwd-2001 .  The X and port -orwarding control features are available only in Tec- tia; OpenSSH uses libwrap only to control access to the main server.  392    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Each client is a pattern that matches a connecting client. It can be:    An IP address in dotted-quad notation  e.g., 192.168.10.1 .   A hostname  DNS, or whatever naming services the host is using .   An IP network as network-number mask  e.g., 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0; note  that the “ n-mask-bits” syntax, 192.168.10.0 24, isn’t recognized .    “ALL”, matching any client source address.  Example 9-1 shows a sample  etc hosts.allow configuration. This setup allows con- nections to any service from the local host’s loopback address, and from all addresses 192.168.10.x. This host is running publicly available servers for POP and IMAP, so we allow connections to these from anywhere, but SSH clients are restricted to sources in another particular range of networks.  Example 9-1. Sample  etc hosts.allow file     etc hosts.allow   network access control for programs invoked by tcpd  see inetd.conf  or  using libwrap.

Note that this host doesn’t have to be on any of the networks listed so far but can be anywhere at all. The rules so far say what is allowed, but don’t by them- selves forbid any connections. So, for example, the forwarding established by the  9.5 Forwarding Security: TCP-Wrappers and libwrap    393  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   command ssh -L1234:localhost:21 remote is accessible only to the local host, since Tectia defaults to binding only the loopback address in any case. But ssh -g -L1234: localhost:21 remote is accessible to blynken.sleepy.net as well. The important differ- ence is that with this use of TCP-wrappers, sshd rejects connections to the for- warded port, 1234, from any other address.  The sshdfwd-x11 line restricts X-forwarding connections to the local host. This means that if ssh connects to this host with X forwarding, only local X clients can use the forwarded X connection. X authentication does this already, but this configura- tion provides an extra bit of protection.  The final line denies any connection that doesn’t match the earlier lines, making this a default-to-closed configuration. If you wanted instead to deny some particular con- nections but allow all others, you would use something like this:  ALL : evil.mordor.net : DENY telnetd : completely.horked.edu : DENY ALL : ALL : ALLOW  The final line is technically not required, but it’s a good idea to make your inten- tions explicit. If you don’t have the host_options syntax available, you instead have an empty hosts.allow file, and the following lines in hosts.deny:  ALL : evil.mordor.net telnetd : completely.horked.edu  Notes About TCP-Wrappers  9.5.2 Here are a few things to remember when using TCP-wrappers:    You can’t distinguish between ports forwarded by SSH-1 and SSH-2: the “sshd- fwd” rules refer to both simultaneously. You can work around this limitation by linking each against a different libwrap.a, compiled with different filenames for the allow and deny files, or by patching the ssh and sshd executables directly, but then you have to keep track of these changes and extra files.    The big drawback to TCP-wrappers is that it affects all users simultaneously. An individual user can’t specify custom access rules for himself; there’s just the sin- gle set of global configuration files for the machine. This limits its usefulness on multiuser machines.    If you compile SSH with the --with-libwrap option, it is automatically and always turned on; there’s no configuration or command-line option to disable the TCP-wrappers check. Remember that SSH does this check not only for for- warded ports and X connections, but also for connections to the main SSH server! As soon as you install a version of sshd with TCP-wrappers, you must ensure that the TCP-wrappers configuration allows connections to the server— for instance, with the rule sshd : ALL in  etc hosts.allow.  394    Chapter 9: Port Forwarding and X Forwarding  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Using hostnames instead of addresses in the TCP-wrappers rule set involves the usual security trade-off. Names are more convenient, and their use avoids break- age in the future if a host address changes. On the other hand, an attacker can potentially subvert the naming service and circumvent the access control. If the host machine is configured to use only its  etc hosts file for name lookup, this may be acceptable even in a highly secure environment.    The TCP-wrappers package includes a program called tcpdchk. This program examines the wrapper control files and reports inconsistencies that might signal problems. Many sites run this periodically as a safety check. Unfortunately, tcpd- chk is written only with explicit wrapping via inetd.conf in mind. It doesn’t have any way of knowing about programs that refer to the control files via the lib- wrap routines, as does sshd. When tcpdchk reads control files with SSH rules, it finds uses of the service names “sshd1,” “sshdfwd-n,” etc., but no correspond- ing wrapped services in inetd.conf, and it generates a warning. Unfortunately, we know of no workaround.  Summary  9.6 In this chapter, we discussed SSH port forwarding and X forwarding. Port forward- ing is a general TCP proxying feature that tunnels TCP connections through an SSH session. This is useful for securing otherwise insecure protocols running on top of TCP or for tunneling TCP connections through firewalls that would otherwise for- bid access. X forwarding is a special case of port forwarding for X Window System connections, for which SSH has extra support. This makes it easy to secure X con- nections with SSH, which is good because X, while popular and useful, is notori- ously insecure. Access control on forwarded ports is normally coarse, but you can achieve finer control with the TCP-wrappers feature.

With so many choices, you might be wondering which options you should use. How can system administrators secure their systems most effectively with SSH?  When set up properly, SSH works well and invisibly, but sometimes a good setup takes a few tries. In addition, there are some ways to configure the software that are simply wrong. If you’re not careful, you can introduce security holes into your system.  In this chapter we present a recommended set of options for compilation, server con- figuration, key management, and client configuration. We assume:    You’re running SSH on a Unix machine.   You want a secure system, sometimes at the expense of flexibility. For instance, rather than tell you to maintain your .rhosts files carefully, we recommend dis- abling Rhosts authentication altogether.  Of course, no single configuration covers all the possibilities; that is, after all, the point of configuration. This is just a sample setup, more on the secure side, to give you a starting point and cover some of the issues involved.  10.1 The Basics Before you start configuring, make sure you’re running an up-to-date SSH version. Some older versions have known security holes that are easily exploited. Always run the latest stable version, and apply updates or patches in a timely manner.  The same goes for your other security software.   Always keep important SSH-related files and directories protected. The server’s host key should be readable only by root. Each user’s home directory, SSH configuration directory, and .rhosts and .shosts files should be owned by the user and protected against all others.  396  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Also, remember that SSH doesn’t and can’t protect against all threats. It can secure your network connections but does nothing against other types of attacks, such as dictionary attacks against your password database. SSH should be an important part, but not the only part, of a robust security policy. [3.10]  10.2 Compile-Time Conﬁguration In Chapter 4, we covered many compile-time flags for building SSH distributions. Several flags should be carefully set to make your server machine maximally secure:  --sysconfdir=...  OpenSSH, Tectia   Make sure your etc directory is on a local disk, not an NFS-mounted partition. If the SSH server reads a file via NFS, the contents are transmitted in the clear across the network, violating security. This is especially true of the host key, which is stored unencrypted in this directory.  --bindir=...  OpenSSH, Tectia  --sbindir=...  OpenSSH, Tectia   Likewise, make sure your SSH executables are installed on a local disk, as they can be spoofed if loaded over NFS.*  --disable-suid-ssh-signer  Tectia   Our recommended serverwide configuration disables hostbased authentication, so there’s no need for setuid permissions for ssh-signer.  --with-tcp-wrappers  OpenSSH  --with-libwrap  Tectia   libwrap affords more precise control over which client machines are allowed to connect to your server. It also makes port and X forwarding more flexible, since otherwise local forwardings are available either only to the local host or from anywhere at all. With GatewayPorts  or ssh -g  and libwrap, you can limit for- warding access to specific hosts. [9.2.1.1]  10.3 Serverwide Conﬁguration Chapter 5 provided a detailed discussion of sshd and how to configure its runtime behavior. Now let’s determine which configuration options are most important for security.  * Or use --prefix to root all SSH system directories together.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  10.3 Serverwide Configuration    397   10.3.1 Disable Other Means of Access SSH can provide a secure front door into your system, but don’t forget to close the back doors. If your system allows access via the infamous r-commands, disable them. This means:    Remove the file  etc hosts.equiv, or make it a read-only empty file.   Disable rshd, rlogind, and rexecd by removing or commenting out their lines in the inetd or xinetd configuration file. For example, in  etc inetd.conf you might do:   turned off -- don't use! shell   stream  tcp   nowait  root   usr sbin in.rshd     in.rshd  Make sure you restart inetd or xinetd after doing this so that the change takes effect.    Educate users not to create .rhosts files.  You might also consider disabling telnetd and other insecure avenues for logging in, permitting logins only via SSH.  sshd_conﬁg for OpenSSH  10.3.2 We’ll now discuss our recommended sshd_config settings for OpenSSH. We have omitted some keywords that aren’t particularly security-related, such as PrintMotd, which simply prints a message after login. For any remaining keywords, use your judgment based on your system and needs.  10.3.2.1 Choice of protocol We recommend disabling the SSH-1 protocol altogether:   OpenSSH Protocol 2  10.3.2.2 Important ﬁles Important files containing your host key, PID, and so on, may be located anywhere on the machine’s local disk. For security’s sake, don’t put them on an NFS-mounted partition. If you do, each time the files are accessed by the SSH server, their contents are transmitted in the clear over the network.   OpenSSH HostKey  etc ssh ssh_host_key PidFile  var run sshd.pid  10.3.2.3 File and directory permissions The StrictModes value requires users to protect their SSH-related files and directo- ries, or else they can’t authenticate.  398    Chapter 10: A Recommended Setup  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    OpenSSH StrictModes yes   OpenSSH Port 22 ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 TcpKeepAlive yes   OpenSSH UseDNS no  10.3.2.4 TCP IP settings The Port and ListenAddress values we recommend are standard. Also, we enable keepalive messages so that connections to clients that have crashed or otherwise become unreachable will terminate rather than hang around and require manual reaping by the sysadmin.  We also disable reverse DNS lookups on incoming connections:  You might think security is increased by reverse DNS lookups, but in fact, DNS isn’t secure enough to guarantee accurate lookups. Also, due to other issues in your Unix and network environment, reverse DNS mappings might not even work prop- erly. [5.3.3.8] Finally, SSH connections can be tremendously slowed down or fail altogether if the client’s DNS is hosed  e.g., lots of nameservers, all unresponsive, so sshd times out . The IP addresses of connecting hosts end up in your logs anyway, so you can look them up later.  10.3.2.5 Login time For logins we allow 30 seconds for a successful authentication, which should be long enough for users and automated processes:   OpenSSH LoginGraceTime 30  10.3.2.6 Authentication We enable only public-key authentication. Password authentication is disabled because passwords can be stolen and used more easily than public keys. This is a fairly harsh restriction, so you might want to leave it enabled depending on your needs. Without password authentication, you have a “chicken and egg” problem: how do users upload their public keys securely the first time? As system administra- tor, you have to institute a process for this transfer: for example, users can generate keys on a client machine and then request that you install them on the server machine. Rhosts authentication is disabled because it can be spoofed. RhostsRSA authentication is disabled too, because overall it is a medium-security method and this configuration is on the side of higher security.   OpenSSH PubkeyAuthentication yes  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  10.3 Serverwide Configuration    399       Already disabled, but we’re being paranoid  PasswordAuthentication no PermitEmptyPasswords no RSAAuthentication no RhostsRSAAuthentication no HostbasedAuthentication no Optional KerberosAuthentication no ChallengeResponseAuthentication no       Optional Optional GSSAPIAuthentication no  We optionally disable Kerberos, keyboard-interactive, and GSSAPI authentication, even though they are quite secure, under the “keep it simple” principle: disable what you aren’t using. Most SSH users aren’t set up to use these techniques. Reenable them if your server needs to support them.  Although we’ve disabled hostbased authentication already, we still forbid sshd to use .rhosts files at all  just in case you reenable hostbased authentication :   OpenSSH IgnoreRhosts yes IgnoreRootRhosts yes  10.3.2.7 Access control If you want to restrict access to particular local accounts or Unix groups, add AllowUsers and AllowGroups lines  or DenyUsers and DenyGroups . We recommend cre- ating a group for all your system’s SSH users, called “ssh”, and configuring the server with:  AllowGroups ssh  Now you’ve made SSH access a specific privilege to be granted or revoked, and you can easily do it for a user without changing the sshd configuration:   usermod -G ssh,... joe  Add user joe to the SSH group  As a bonus, you’ve disallowed SSH access by system accounts like bin, sys, and daemon that should never use SSH anyway.  We also permit the superuser to connect via SSH but not by password authentica- tion. This is redundant but consistent with turning off PasswordAuthentication.   OpenSSH PermitRootLogin without-password  10.3.2.8 Forwarding We permit TCP port forwarding and X forwarding so that users can secure their other TCP connections:   OpenSSH AllowTcpForwarding yes X11Forwarding yes  400    Chapter 10: A Recommended Setup  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

OpenSSH Subsystem    sftp     usr lib ssh sftp-server  sshd2_conﬁg for Tectia  10.3.3 We now move to our recommended sshd2_config settings for Tectia. Again, we’ve omitted some keywords that are not security-related.  10.3.3.1 Choice of protocol We recommend disabling the SSH-1 protocol altogether:   Tectia Ssh1Compatibility no Sshd1Path  dev null  Not strictly necessary, just our paranoia  10.3.3.2 Important ﬁles As we have mentioned for OpenSSH [10.3.2.2], make sure all SSH-related files are on local disks, not remotely mounted partitions:  For the following settings, consider the pros and cons of storing user files on NFS- mounted filesystems: [10.7]   Tectia HostKeyFile  etc ssh2 hostkey PublicHostKeyFile  etc ssh2 hostkey.pub RandomSeedFile  etc ssh2 random_seed   Tectia UserConfigDirectory directory IdentityFile filename AuthorizationFile filename  10.3.3.3 File and directory permissions The StrictModes value requires users to protect their SSH-related files and directo- ries, or else they can’t authenticate:  10.3.3.4 TCP IP settings We recommend the same configuration as for OpenSSH, for the same reasons: [10.3.2.4]   Tectia StrictModes yes   Tectia Port 22  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  10.3 Serverwide Configuration    401   ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 KeepAlive yes RequireReverseMapping no  10.3.3.5 Login time For logins we allow 30 seconds for a successful authentication, which should be long enough for users and automated processes:   Tectia LoginGraceTime 30  10.3.3.6 Authentication These settings mirror those for OpenSSH:   Tectia AllowedAuthentications publickey RequiredAuthentications publickey Overrides AllowedAuthentications; we’re being paranoid PermitEmptyPasswords no  Already disabled, but we’re being paranoid  Although we’ve disabled hostbased authentication already, we still forbid sshd to use .rhosts files at all  just in case you reenable hostbased authentication . We also disable UserKnownHosts to prevent users from extending trust to unknown hosts for the purpose of hostbased authentication. The superuser can still specify trusted hosts in  etc ssh2 knownhosts.   Tectia IgnoreRhosts yes IgnoreRootRhosts yes UserKnownHosts no  10.3.3.7 Access control We permit SSH connections only from within the local domain*:   Tectia AllowHosts fred@* *.your.domain.com  Just an example  except for the account fred in this example, which may receive connections from anywhere.  If you want to restrict access to particular local accounts or Unix groups, add AllowUsers and AllowGroups lines  or DenyUsers and DenyGroups . Also create an “ssh” group as we described earlier. [10.3.2.7]  We permit the superuser to connect via SSH but not by password authentication. This is redundant but consistent with turning off PasswordAuthentication.   Tectia PermitRootLogin nopwd  * The reliability of this restriction depends on the integrity of DNS. Unfortunately, due to the implementation  of AllowHosts, restriction by IP address is no more secure. [5.5.1]  402    Chapter 10: A Recommended Setup  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   10.3.3.8 Forwarding We permit TCP port forwarding and X forwarding so that users can secure their other TCP connections:   Tectia AllowTcpForwarding yes X11Forwarding yes   Tectia Ciphers anycipher Ciphers anystdcipher  10.3.3.9 Encryption Use either of the following settings as fits your needs. The notable feature is that they both exclude the “none” cipher which may be a security risk.  10.3.3.10SFTP Confirm that the SFTP subsystem is defined so that incoming sftp connections will work.  It is enabled in the default  etc ssh2 sshd2_config for Tectia.    Tectia subsystem-sftp   sftp-server  10.4 Per-Account Conﬁguration Users should be instructed not to create .rhosts files. If hostbased authentication is enabled in the local SSH server, advise users to create .shosts files instead of .rhosts files.  For OpenSSH, each key in ~ .ssh authorized_keys should be restricted by appropri- ate options. First, use the from option to restrict access to particular keys by particu- lar hosts when appropriate. For example, suppose your authorized_keys file contains a public key for your home PC, myhome.isp.net. No other machine will ever authen- ticate using this key, so make the relationship explicit:  from="myhome.isp.net" ...key...  Also set idle timeouts for appropriate keys:  from="myhome.isp.net",idle-timeout=5m ...key...  Finally, for each key, consider whether port forwarding, agent forwarding, and tty allocation are ever necessary for incoming connections. If not, disable these fea- tures with no-port-forwarding, no-agent-forwarding, and no-pty, respectively:  from="myhome.isp.net",idle-timeout=5m,no-agent-forwarding ...key...

All rights reserved.  10.4 Per-Account Configuration    403   10.5 Key Management We recommend creating user keys at least 1024 bits long. Protect your key with a good passphrase. Make it lengthy and use a mixture of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and symbolic characters. Don’t use words found in a dictionary.  Empty passphrases should be avoided unless you absolutely need to use one—for example, in an automated batch script. [11.1.2.2]  10.6 Client Conﬁguration Most SSH security pertains to the server, but SSH clients have security-related set- tings too. Here are a few tips:    Whenever you leave a computer while SSH clients are running, lock the com- puter’s display with a password-protected screen locker. This is particularly important if you’re running an agent that permits an intruder to access your remote accounts without a passphrase.    In your client configuration file, turn on some safety features as mandatory  values:   OpenSSH  Put at the top of your configuration file Host *   GatewayPorts no   StrictHostKeyChecking ask  ForwardX11Trusted no   Tectia  Put at the bottom of your configuration file *:  GatewayPorts no  StrictHostKeyChecking ask  TrustX11Applications no  The GatewayPorts value forbids remote clients from connecting to locally for- warded ports. Finally, rather than blindly connect, the StrictHostKeyChecking value warns you of any changed host keys and asks what you want to do. For X11 forwarding we elect to generate a new, untrusted xauth key rather than inherit the trust already in effect. [9.4.5.3]  10.7 Remote Home Directories  NFS, AFS  We’ve mentioned NFS several times as a potential security risk for SSH installations. Now we delve into more detail on this topic.  In today’s world of ubiquitous networking, it is common for your home directory to be shared among many machines via a network file-sharing protocol, such as SMB  404    Chapter 10: A Recommended Setup  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   for Windows machines or NFS and AFS for Unix. This is convenient, but it does raise some issues with SSH, both technical and security-related.  SSH examines files in the target account’s home directory in order to make critical decisions about authentication and authorization. For every form of authentica- tion except password, the various control files in your home directory  authorized_ keys, .shosts, .k5login, etc.  enable SSH access to your account. Two things are therefore important:    Your home directory needs to be safe from tampering.   SSH must have access to your home directory.  10.7.1 NFS Security Risks The security of shared home directories is often not very high. Although the NFS protocol has versions and implementations that afford greater security, it is woefully insecure in most installations. Often, it employs no reliable form of authentication whatsoever, but rather, uses the same scheme as rsh: the source IP address and DNS identify clients, and a privileged source port is proof of trustworthiness. It then sim- ply believes the uid number encoded in NFS requests and grants access as that user. Breaking into a home directory can be as simple as:  1. Discover the uid, and create an account with that uid on a laptop running Unix. 2. Connect that machine to the network, borrowing the IP address of a trusted  3. Issue a mount command, su to the account with the uid, and start rifling through  host.  the files.  At this point, an intruder can easily add another public key to authorized_keys, and the account is wide open. The moral is that when designing a system, keep in mind that the security of SSH is no stronger than that of the home directories involved. You need at least to be aware of the trade-off between security and convenience involved here. If you are using an insecure NFS and want to avoid this weakness, you can:    Use Tectia, which has the UserConfigDirectory option to place the per-user SSH configuration files, normally in ~ .ssh2, elsewhere—say, in  var ssh  . You can still set the permissions so their owners can control them, but they won’t be shared via NFS and thus not vulnerable. You can do the same with OpenSSH, but as it lacks such a configuration option, you need to edit the source code.    Turn off hostbased authentication, since the ~ .shosts control file is vulnerable, and you can’t change its location. Or, if you want to use hostbased authentica- tion, set the IgnoreRhosts option. This causes sshd to ignore ~ .shosts, relying instead solely on the systemwide  etc shosts.equiv file.  10.7 Remote Home Directories  NFS, AFS     405  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     If you are truly paranoid, disable swapping on your Unix machine. Otherwise, sensitive information such as server, host, and user keys, or passwords, may be written to disk as part of the normal operation of the Unix virtual memory sys- tem  should the running sshd be swapped out to disk . Someone with root access  and a lot of knowledge and luck  could read the swap partition and tease this information out of the mess there—though it’s a difficult feat. Another option is to use an operating system that encrypts swap pages on disk, such as OpenBSD.  10.7.2 NFS Access Problems Another problem that can arise with SSH and NFS is one of access rights. With the public-key or hostbased methods, if the per-user control files are in the usual place, sshd must read the target account’s home directory in order to perform authentica- tion. When that directory is on the same machine as sshd, this isn’t a problem. sshd runs as root, and therefore has access to all files. However, if the directory is mounted from elsewhere via NFS, sshd might not have access to the directory. NFS is commonly configured so that the special access privileges accorded the root account don’t extend to remote filesystems.  Now, this isn’t a truly serious restriction. Since one of the root privileges is the abil- ity to create a process with any uid, root can simply “become” the right user, and access the remote directory. Current versions of Tectia and OpenSSH handle this correctly, but you might run into older versions that do not. You can work around the problem, but to do so you must make your authorized_keys file world-readable; the only way to let root read it remotely is to let everyone read it. This isn’t too objec- tionable. The authorized_keys file contains no secrets; though you might prefer not to reveal which keys allow access to your account, thus advertising which keys to steal. However, to grant this access, you must make your home directory and ~ .ssh world-searchable  that is, permissions at least 711 . This doesn’t allow other users to steal the contents, but it does allow them to guess at filenames and have those guesses verified. It also means that you must be careful about permissions on your files, since the top-level permissions on your directory don’t prevent access by others.  All this may be entirely unacceptable or no problem at all; it depends on your atti- tude toward your files and the other users on the machines where your home direc- tory is accessible.  10.7.3 AFS Access Problems The Andrew File System, or AFS, is a file-sharing protocol similar in purpose to NFS, but considerably more sophisticated. It uses Kerberos-4 for user authentication and is generally more secure than NFS. The access problem discussed previously comes up for AFS, but it’s more work to solve, and this time, OpenSSH is the winner.  406    Chapter 10: A Recommended Setup  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   AFS uses its own authentication system; access to remote files is controlled by pos- session of an appropriate AFS token. There are no uid-switching games root can play; sshd must have the right AFS token in order to access your home directory. If you were logged into that machine, of course, you could use the usual AFS klog com- mand to authenticate to AFS. However, sshd needs it before you’ve logged in, so there’s a bit of a quandary.  There is one solution available, though, involving Kerberos. If Kerberos is available, AFS will usually be configured so that AFS tokens can be obtained via Kerberos, bringing AFS into the Kerberos single-signon universe. If you have protocol-2 Ker- beros support enabled with ticket forwarding [11.5.2.2], then OpenSSH can use your forwarded credentials to automatically obtain the needed AFS token:   ~ .ssh config GSSAPIAuthentication       yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials  yes KerberosGetAFSToken        yes  Note that the older OpenSSH Kerberos-4 mechanism for this, controlled by the keyword AFSTokenPassing, is no longer available. The current support is only for Kerberos-5 and GSSAPI.  10.8 Summary OpenSSH and Tectia are complex and have many options. It is vitally important to understand all options when installing and running SSH servers and clients, so their behavior will conform to your local security policy.  We have presented our recommended options for a high security setting. Your needs may vary. For instance, you might want the flexibility of other authentication meth- ods that we have forbidden in our configuration.

Some interesting features of SSH don’t come to the surface unless examined closely, so we hope you get a lot out of these case studies. Roll up your sleeves, dive in, and have fun.  11.1 Unattended SSH: Batch or cron Jobs SSH isn’t only a great interactive tool, but also a resource for automation. Batch scripts, cron jobs, and other automated tasks can benefit from the security provided by SSH, but only if implemented properly. The major challenge is authentication: how can a client prove its identity when no human is available to type a password or passphrase?  We’ll just write “password” from now on to mean both.  You must carefully select an authentication method, and then equally carefully make it work. Once this infrastructure is established, you must invoke ssh properly to avoid prompting the user. In this case study, we discuss the pros and cons of different authentication methods for operating an SSH client unattended.  Note that any kind of unattended authentication presents a security problem and requires compromise, and SSH is no exception. Without a human present when needed to provide credentials  type a password, provide a thumbprint, etc. , those credentials must be stored persistently somewhere on the host system. Therefore, an attacker who compromises the system badly enough can use those credentials to impersonate the program and gain whatever access it has. Selecting a technique is a matter of understanding the pros and cons of the available methods, and picking your preferred poison.  11.1.1 Password Authentication Rule number 1: forget password authentication if you care about the security of your batch jobs. As we mentioned, authentication for any unattended process will require  408  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   some kind of persistent secret lying around, so it might seem that a password in a protected file will do as well as anything else, and password authentication is simple. In a strict sense that’s correct, but it’s a bad idea both practically and securitywise. Embedding a password in a command line is unwise: it may be exposed to other users by simple commands such as ps, end up in shell history files  e.g. ~ .bash_ history  or system logs, etc. In fact, most SSH clients deliberately require terminal input  a “tty”  for a password, precisely to discourage this. You can use a tool like Expect to get around this limitation, but that will be awkward. Another practical limitation is that more methods tend to be available on the server side to restrict log- ins with public-key authentication, e.g., the “command” parameters in ~ .ssh  authorized_keys  OpenSSH  and ~ .ssh2 authorization  Tectia . This is just an imple- mentation detail, but it’s very relevant since you definitely want to restrict unat- tended logins to do just what they’re intended to do. More generally, compared to other available methods, SSH password authentication is just inherently weak: passwords tend to be short and often guessable, and the cli- ent must reveal the password to the server as part of the authentication process; so if the server has been compromised, it will get your password. Public-key authentica- tion, however, does not reveal the private key in the process. In the real world, though, you might be stuck using password authentication any- way. Perhaps you have to automate a transaction with a server not under your con- trol; it only supports passwords, and you can’t get that changed. If you must, we suggest co-opting the “askpass” facility if it’s available. [6.3.3] The ssh-askpass pro- gram normally displays a window prompting for the password, but it can use instead a program that provides the password from wherever you’re storing it. It does so via a pipe, which is much better than letting it appear on a command line.  11.1.2 Public-Key Authentication In public-key authentication, a private key is the client’s credentials. Therefore, the batch job needs access to the key, which must be stored where the job can access it. You have three choices of location for the key, which we discuss separately:    Store the encrypted key and its passphrase in the filesystem.   Store a plaintext  unencrypted  private key in the filesystem, so it doesn’t require  a passphrase.    Store the key in an agent, which keeps secrets out of the filesystem but requires a  human to decrypt the key at system boot time.  11.1.2.1 Storing the passphrase in the ﬁlesystem In this technique, you store an encrypted key and its passphrase in the filesystem so that a script can access them. We don’t recommend this method, since you can store an unencrypted key in the filesystem with the same level of security  and consider- ably less complication . In either case, you rely solely on the filesystem’s protections to keep the key secure. This observation is the rationale for the next technique.  11.1 Unattended SSH: Batch or cron Jobs    409  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.1.2.2 Using a plaintext key A plaintext or unencrypted key requires no passphrase. To create one, run ssh-key- gen and simply press the Return key when prompted for a passphrase  or similarly, remove the passphrase from an existing key using ssh-keygen –p . You can then sup- ply the key filename on the ssh command line using the –i option, or in the client configuration file with the IdentityFile keyword. [7.4.2]  Usually plaintext keys are undesirable, equivalent to leaving your password in a file in your account. They are never a good idea for interactive logins, since the SSH agent provides the same benefits in a much more secure fashion. But a plaintext key is a viable option for automation, since the unattended aspect forces us to rely on some kind of persistent state in the machine. The filesystem is one possibility.  Plaintext keys are frightening, though. To steal the key, an attacker needs to override filesystem protections only once, and this doesn’t necessarily require any fancy hack- ing: stealing a single backup tape will do. You can arrange to keep them off backups, but that’s an additional complication. If you need your batch jobs to continue work- ing after an unattended system restart, plaintext keys are pretty much your best option. If the situation allows for some leeway in this regard, however, consider using ssh-agent instead.  11.1.2.3 Using an agent ssh-agent provides another, somewhat less vulnerable method of key storage for batch jobs. A human invokes an agent and loads the needed keys from passphrase- protected key files, just once. Thereafter, unattended jobs use this long-running agent for authentication.  In this case, the keys are still in plaintext but within the memory space of the run- ning agent rather than in a file on disk. As a matter of practical cracking, it is more difficult to extract a data structure from the address space of a running process than to gain illicit access to a file. Also, this solution avoids the problem of an intruder walking off with a backup tape containing the plaintext key.  Security can still be compromised by other methods, though. The agent provides access to its services via a Unix-domain socket, which appears as a node in the file- system. Anyone who can read and write that socket might be able to instruct the agent to sign authentication requests and thus gain use of the keys. Some agent implementations attempt further checks, such as ensuring the communicating pro- cess runs under the same uid, but not all flavors of Unix support this. [6.3.4.1] In any event, this compromise isn’t quite so devastating since the attacker can’t obtain the actual keys through the agent socket. She merely gains use of the keys for as long as the agent is running and as long as she can maintain her compromise of the host.  The agent method does have a down side: the system can’t continue unattended after a reboot. When the host comes up again automatically, the batch jobs won’t have their keys until someone shows up to restart the agent and provide the passphrases  410    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   to load the keys. This is just a cost of the improved security, and you have a pager, right?  Another bit of complication with the agent method is that you must arrange for the batch jobs to find the agent. SSH clients locate an agent via an environment vari- able pointing to the agent socket, such as SSH_AUTH_SOCK for the OpenSSH agent. [6.3.2.1] When you start the agent for batch jobs, you need to record its output where the jobs can find it. For instance, if the job is a shell script, you can store the environment values in a file:  then instrument any scripts to set the same values for the environment variables:  $ ssh-agent  head -2 > ~ agent-info $ cat ~ agent-info setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK  tmp ssh-res ssh-12327-agent; setenv SSH_AGENT_PID 12328;  You can add keys to the agent  assuming C-shell syntax here :  $ source ~ agent-info $ ssh-add batch-key Need passphrase for batch-key  batch job SSH key . Enter passphrase: **************  ! bin csh  Source the agent-info file to get access to our ssh-agent. set agent = ~ agent-info if  -r $agent  then   source $agent else   echo "Can't find or read agent file; exiting."   exit 1 endif  Now use SSH for something... ssh -q -o 'BatchMode yes' user@remote-server my-job-command  You also need to ensure that the batch jobs  and nobody else!  can read and write the socket. If there’s only one uid using the agent, the simplest thing to do is start the agent under that uid  e.g., as root, do su   ssh-agent ... . If multiple uids are using the agent, you must adjust the permissions on the socket and its containing directory so that these uids can all access it, perhaps using group permissions.  Some operating systems behave oddly with respect to permissions on Unix-domain sockets. Some versions of Solaris, for example, com- pletely ignore the modes on a socket, allowing any process at all full access to it. To protect a socket in such situations, set the containing directory to forbid access. For example, if the containing directory is mode 700, only the directory owner may access the socket.  This assumes there’s no other shortcut to the socket located elsewhere, such as a hard link.   11.1 Unattended SSH: Batch or cron Jobs    411  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Using an agent for automation is more complicated and restrictive than using a plaintext key; however, it is more resistant to attack and doesn’t leave the key on disk and tape where it can be stolen. Considering that the agent is still vulnerable to being misused via the filesystem, and that it is intended to run indefinitely, the advantages of this method are debatable. Still, we recommend the agent method as the most secure and flexible strategy for automated SSH usage in a security- conscious environment.  11.1.3 Hostbased Authentication If security concerns are relatively light, consider hostbased authentication for batch jobs. In this case, the “credentials” are the operating system’s notion of a process’s uid: the identity under which a process is running, which determines what rights it has over protected objects. An attacker need only manage to get control of a process running under your uid, to impersonate you to a remote SSH server. If he breaks root on the client, this is particularly simple, since root may create processes under any uid. The real crux, though, is the client host key: if the attacker gets that, he can sign bogus authentication requests presenting himself as any user at all, and sshd will believe them.  Hostbased authentication is in many ways the least secure SSH authentication method. [3.4.3.6] It leaves systems vulnerable to transitive compromise: if an attacker gains access to an account on host H, she immediately has access to the same account on all machines that trust H, with no further effort. Also, hostbased configuration is limited, fragile, and easy to get wrong. Public-key authentication affords both greater security and flexibility, particularly since you can restrict the commands that may be invoked and the client hosts that may connect, using its forced commands and other options in the authorization file.  Of course, if your security policy permits and you’re already using hostbased for gen- eral user authentication, then you’re all set for batch jobs too. However if you’re using something stronger for user authentication, and you’re considering the host- based method for batch jobs, then we recommend that you:    Restrict its use to the batch accounts only  via  etc shosts.equiv rules ; continue  to use stronger methods for interactive authentication.    Use only the SSH-specific configuration files  etc shosts.equiv and ~ .shosts, and not the legacy files  etc hosts.equiv and ~ .rhosts. This avoids any accidental changes to the behavior of wildly insecure mechanisms like rcmd and rsh.    Set options such as OpenSSH IgnoreRhosts and IgnoreUserKnownHosts, and Tec- tia AllowSHosts DenySHosts, if possible. Since per-account hostbased configura- tion can override the systemwide files, it’s best to disable them.  412    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.1.4 Kerberos There’s no reason to deploy Kerberos [11.4] solely in order to support batch jobs; it has no special overall advantage in this regard. However, if you’re already using Ker- beros, you might want to keep things simple by using it for batch as well as interac- tive jobs. Unattended Kerberos usage has similar security properties to using a plaintext SSH key as described earlier: the Kerberos principal’s key is stored on disk, can be similarly strong since it does not have to be derived from a user-memorable passphrase, and is not revealed in the authentication process.  To do this, use the kadmin command:  $ kadmin -q "ktadd -k keytab principal"  to store the principal’s key in the file keytab, and protect that file appropriately  e.g., so that only the Unix batch account can read it . The batch job can then call kinit:  $ kinit -k -t keytab  to obtain Kerberos credentials for that principal.  We suggest the following arrangement:    Arrange that the keytab file does not travel insecurely over the network, e.g., on an unsecured NFS filesystem. Perhaps also arrange that it is not dumped to backup tapes.    Create separate principals for batch jobs; do not use existing user principals.   Create a random key for the batch principal using the kadmin option, addprinc  -randkey.    If feasible, periodically change these keys. An advantage of the Kerberos system is that this does not require changing corresponding authorization entries, as changing a simple SSH key would require updating the matching authorized_ keys files. Any running jobs will have to be restarted, though, since their creden- tials will become invalid.    As always, restrict what the batch principal can do on the server side, here using  the Kerberos ~ .k5login or ~ .k5users files.  Kerberos-5 contains support for long-running jobs with “renewable” tickets, but note that this is still intended for jobs started interactively; it just supports those that may run for a long time. It is not intended as a solution for truly unattended jobs.  11.1.5 General Precautions for Batch Jobs Regardless of the method you choose, some extra precautions will help secure your environment.  11.1 Unattended SSH: Batch or cron Jobs    413  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.1.5.1 Least-privilege accounts The account under which the automated job runs should have only those privileges needed to run the job, and no more. Don’t run every batch job as root just because it’s convenient. Arrange your filesystem and other protections so that the job can run as a less-privileged user. Remember that unattended remote jobs increase the risk of account compromise, so take the extra trouble to avoid the root account whenever possible.  11.1.5.2 Separate, locked-down automation accounts Create accounts that are used solely for automation. Try not to run system batch jobs in a user account, since you might not be able to reduce its privileges to the small set necessary to support the job. In many cases, an automation account doesn’t even need to admit interactive logins. If jobs running under its uid are created directly by the batch job manager  e.g., cron , the account doesn’t need a password and should be locked.  11.1.5.3 Restricted-use keys As much as possible, restrict the target account to perform only the work needed for the job. With public-key authentication, automated jobs should use keys that aren’t shared by interactive logins. Imagine that someday you might need to eliminate the key for security reasons, and you don’t want to affect other users or jobs by this change. For maximum control, use a separate key for each automated task. Addi- tionally, place all possible restrictions on the key by setting options in the authoriza- tion file. [8.2] The command option restricts the key to running only the needed remote command, and the from option restricts usage to appropriate client hosts. Consider always adding the following options as well, if they don’t interfere with the job:  no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty  These make it harder to misuse the key should it be stolen.  If you’re using hostbased authentication, these restrictions aren’t available. In this case, it’s best to use a special shell for the account, which limits the commands that may be executed. Since sshd uses the target account’s shell to run any commands on the user’s behalf, this is an effective restriction. One standard tool is the Unix “restricted shell.” Confusingly, the restricted shell is usually named “rsh,” but has nothing to do with the Berkeley r-command for opening a remote shell, rsh.  11.1.5.4 Useful ssh options When running SSH commands in a batch job, it’s a good idea to use these options:  ssh -q -o 'BatchMode yes'  414    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The –q option is for quiet mode, preventing SSH from printing a variety of warnings. This is sometimes necessary if you’re using SSH as a pipe from one program to another. Otherwise, the SSH warnings may be interpreted as remote program out- put and confuse the local program. [7.4.17]  The BatchMode keyword tells SSH not to prompt the user, who in this case doesn’t exist. This makes error reporting more straightforward, eliminating some confusing SSH messages about failing to access a tty. [7.4.6.4]  11.1.6 Recommendations Our recommended method for best security with unattended SSH operation is public- key authentication with keys stored in an agent. If that isn’t feasible, hostbased or plaintext-key authentication may be used instead; your local security concerns and needs will determine which is preferable, using the foregoing discussion as a guideline.  To the extent possible, use separate accounts and keys for each job. By doing so, you limit the damage caused by compromising any one account, or stealing any one key. But of course, there is a complexity trade-off here; if you have 100 batch jobs, sepa- rate accounts or keys for each one may be too much to deal with. In that case, parti- tion the jobs into categories according to the privileges they need, and use a separate account and or key for each category of job.  You can ease the burden of multiple keys by applying a little automation to the busi- ness of loading them. The keys can all be stored under the same passphrase: a script prompts for the passphrase, then runs ssh-add multiple times to add the various keys. Or they have different passphrases, and the human inserts a diskette contain- ing the passphrases when loading them. Perhaps the passphrase list itself is encrypted under a single password provided by the human. For that matter, the keys themselves can be kept on the key diskette and not stored on the filesystem at all: whatever fits your needs and paranoia level.  11.2 FTP and SSH One of the most frequently asked questions about SSH is, “How can I use port for- warding to secure FTP?” If the forwarding in question is the traditional sort of static port forwarding provided by SSH clients such as OpenSSH, then the short answer is that you usually can’t, at least not completely, as we will explain in detail in this sec- tion. Such port forwarding can protect your account password, but usually not the files being transferred. Still, protecting your password is a big win, since the most egregious problem with FTP is that it usually reveals your password to network snoopers.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    415   It’s worth noting that FTP can in fact be used securely on its own. Both FTP and Telnet are famously considered “insecure,” but it’s more accurate to say that they are simply used insecurely most of the time. Both protocols allow the use of strong authentication and encryption methods, such as SSL or Kerberos. However, the vast majority of FTP and Telnet servers in the world do not provide these features, and so we are left trying to secure them as best we can with other tools, such as SSH.  Before trying to figure out how to forward FTP over SSH, you should first ask your- self whether you really need to use FTP at all. If possible, it’s far less trouble to sim- ply use a file-transfer method that works easily over SSH, such as scp, sftp, rsync, etc.  and remember that SFTP and FTP have nothing to do with one another, save the acronym . If you’re going to secure FTP end-to-end with SSH, then the FTP server must already be running an SSH server—which means it shouldn’t be hard to make the requisite files available via SSH as well. But the real world is messy, and you might be stuck with FTP.  FTP-Speciﬁc Tools for SSH  11.2.1 As we will describe, the FTP protocol is not amenable to standard SSH port forward- ing. There are SSH clients, however, with features tailored specifically for dealing with FTP. We describe two of them here.  11.2.1.1 VanDyke’s SecureFX VanDyke Software  http:  www.vandyke.com   has a useful Windows product, specif- ically designed to forward FTP over SSH, data connections and all: SecureFX. It is a specialized combination of SSH-2 and FTP clients. SecureFX acts as a GUI FTP cli- ent, first creating an SSH connection, then logging into the remote FTP server via an SSH channel. Whenever it needs an FTP data connection, it dynamically creates the needed tcpip-direct channels  for passive mode  or remote forwardings  active mode ; to the remote FTP server, SecureFX looks like an FTP client connecting from the same host. SecureFX works very smoothly and we recommend the product.  SecureFX is a great solution if you can choose your client. However, perhaps you need to secure FTP traffic in an existing system, where you can’t replace the client side. In this case, Tectia has a feature that will help.  11.2.1.2 Tectia client The Tectia software has a special FTP-aware port-forwarding mode. In the GUI Win- dows client, when configuring tunneling in the Add New Outgoing Tunnel dialog box, set Type = FTP. In the command-line version, FTP forwarding works this way:  416    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.    Tectia $ ssh -L ftp 1234:localhost:21 server  This forwards local port 1234 to an FTP server running on the standard FTP port  21 , on the same machine as the SSH server. After connecting with a regular FTP cli- ent to the forwarded port, FTP data-transfer commands such as ls, get, put, etc., should work normally, in either FTP’s “active” or “passive” mode. Tectia intercepts and alters FTP command traffic, particularly the PORT and PASV commands and their responses. It does this to “fool” the FTP client and server into using SSH-forwarded ports it creates for data channels, instead of the direct connections each side intends to make.  Static Port Forwarding and FTP: A Study in Pain  11.2.2 So far, we’ve described a number of alternatives for dealing with SSH and FTP. If you’re particularly unlucky, though, you might be stuck having to secure FTP with SSH, without any of these options—for instance, using OpenSSH, which has no FTP-specific forwarding features. If so, this section is for you. And even if you’re not stuck with this unenviable task, you may find the discussion useful for understand- ing the general problem and limitations. Or simply for the morbid fascination of it all.  Here, we explain in detail what you can and can’t do with FTP and SSH, and why. Some difficulties are due to limitations of FTP, not only when interacting with SSH, but also in the presence of firewalls and network address translation  NAT . We will discuss each of these situations, since firewalls and NAT are common nowadays, and their presence might be the reason you’re trying to forward FTP securely. If you are a system administrator responsible for both SSH and these networking components, we will try to guide you to a general understanding that will help you design and troubleshoot entire systems.  Depending on your network environment, different problems may arise when com- bining SSH with FTP. Since we can’t cover every possible environment, we describe each problem in isolation, illustrating its symptoms and recommending solutions. If you have multiple problems occurring simultaneously, the software behavior you observe might not match the examples we’ve given. We recommend reading the entire case study once  at least cursorily  before experimenting with your system, so you will have an idea of the problems you might encounter. Afterward, go ahead and try the examples at your computer.  The FTP Protocol  11.2.3 To understand the problems between FTP and SSH, you need to understand a bit about the FTP protocol. Most TCP services involve a single connection from client to  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    417   server on a known, server-side port. FTP, however, involves multiple connections in both directions, mostly to unpredictable port numbers:    A single control connection for carrying commands from the client and responses from the server. It connects on TCP port 21 and persists for the entire FTP session.    A number of data connections for transferring files and other data, such as direc- tory listings. For each file transfer, a new data connection is opened and closed, and each one may be on a different port. These data connections may come from the client or the server.  Let’s run a typical FTP client and view the control connection. We’ll use debug mode  ftp –d  to make visible the FTP protocol commands the client sends on the control connection, since they aren’t normally displayed. Debug mode prints these commands preceded by “--->”. For example:  You’ll also see responses from the server, which the client prints by default. These are preceded by a numerical code:  ---> USER res  230 User res logged in.  Here’s a session in which the user res connects to an FTP server, logs in, and attempts to change directory twice, once successfully and once not:  $ ftp -d aaor.lionaka.net Connected to aaor.lionaka.net. 220 aaor.lionaka.net FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. ---> SYST 215 UNIX Type: L8 Version: SUNOS Remote system type is UNIX.

Password: ---> PASS XXXX 230 User res logged in. ftp> cd rep ---> CWD rep 250 CWD command successful. ftp> cd utopia ---> CWD utopia 550 utopia: No such file or directory. ftp> quit ---> QUIT 221 Goodbye.  The control connection can be secured by standard port forwarding because it is on a known port  21 . [9.2] In contrast, the destination port numbers for data connec- tions are generally not known in advance, so setting up SSH forwarding for these  418    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   connections is far more difficult. There’s a second standard port number associated with FTP, the ftp-data port  20 . But this is only the source port for data connections coming from the server; nothing ever listens on it.  Surprisingly, the data connections generally go in the opposite direction from the control one; that is, the server makes a TCP connection back to the client in order to transfer data. The ports on which these connections occur can be negotiated dynami- cally by the FTP client and server, and doing so involves sending explicit IP address information inside the FTP protocol. These features of usual FTP operation can cause difficulties when forwarding SSH connections and in other scenarios involving firewalls or NAT.  An alternative FTP mode, called passive mode, addresses one of these problems: it reverses the sense of the data connections so that they go from the client to the server. Passive mode is a matter of FTP client behavior, and so is determined by a cli- ent setting. The behavior of setting up data connections from the server to the client, which we will call active-mode FTP, is traditionally the default in FTP clients, although that’s changing. With a command-line client, the passive command switches to passive mode. The internal command that the client sends the server to tell it to enter passive mode is PASV. We discuss specific problems, and how passive mode solves them, in upcoming sections. Figure 11-1 summarizes the workings of passive and active FTP.

As usual, the FTP server machine must be running an SSH server, and you must have an account on it that you may access via SSH  see Figure 11-2 .  control  FTP client  2001  SSH Client  data  SSH  passive mode  10,1,2,17,80,27   S  10.1 .2.17  20507  FTP server  21  control  SSH Server  ssh -L2001:S:21 S  Figure 11-2. Forwarding the control connection  Suppose you are logged into the machine client and want to connect securely to an FTP server on the machine server. To forward the FTP control connection, run a port-forwarding command on client:*  client% ssh -L2001:server:21 server  Then, to use the forwarded port:  client% ftp localhost 2001 Connected to localhost 220 server FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. Password: 230 User res logged in. ftp> passive Passive mode on. ftp> ls ...and so on  There are two important things to notice about the commands we just recom- mended. We will discuss each.    The target of the forwarding is server, not localhost.   The client uses passive mode.  * If you’re using the popular ncftp client, run this instead: ncftp ftp:  client:2001.  420    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.2.4.1 Choosing the forwarding target We chose server as the target of our forwarding, not localhost  i.e., we didn’t use –L2001:localhost:21 . This is contrary to our previous advice, which was to use localhost where possible as the forwarding target. [9.2.8] Well, that technique isn’t advisable here. Here’s what can happen if you do:  client% ftp localhost 2001 Connected to client 220 client FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. 331 Password required for res. Password: 230 User res logged in. ftp> ls 200 PORT command successful. 425 Can't build data connection: Cannot assign requested address. ftp>  The problem is a bit obscure but can be revealed by an execution trace of the FTP server as it responds to the ls command. The following output was produced by the Linux strace command:*  so_socket 2, 2, 0, "", 1                        = 5 bind 5, 0x0002D614, 16, 3                       = 0         AF_INET  name = 127.0.0.1  port = 20 connect 5, 0x0002D5F4, 16, 1                    Err126 EADDRNOTAVAIL         AF_INET  name = 192.168.10.1  port = 2845 write 1, " 4 2 5   C a n ' t   b u".., 67       = 67  The FTP server is trying to make a TCP connection to the correct client address but from the wrong socket: the ftp-data port on its loopback address, 127.0.0.1. The loopback interface can talk only to other loopback addresses on the same machine. TCP knows this and responds with the error “address not available”  EADDRNOT- AVAIL . The FTP server is being careful to originate the data connection from the same address to which the client made the control connection. Here, the control connection has been forwarded through SSH; so to the FTP server, it appears to come from the local host. And because we used the loopback address as the forward- ing target, the source address of that leg of the forwarded path  from sshd to ftpd  is also the loopback address. To eliminate the problem, use the server’s nonloopback IP address as the target; this causes the FTP server to originate data connections from that address.  You might try to solve this problem using passive mode, since then the server wouldn’t originate any connections. But if you try:  ftp> passive Passive mode on.  * If you’re on a Solaris 2  SunOS 5  system, the corresponding operating system-supplied program is called truss. There is also an strace program with Solaris, but it is completely unrelated. Solaris 1  SunOS 4 and ear- lier  has a trace command, and BSD has ktrace.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    421   ftp> ls 227 Entering Passive Mode  127,0,0,1,128,133  ftp: connect: Connection refused ftp>  In this case, the failure is a slightly different manifestation of the same problem. This time, the server listens for an incoming data connection from the client, but again, it thinks the client is local, so it listens on its loopback address. It sends this socket  address 127.0.0.1, port 32901  to the client, and the client tries to connect to it. But this causes the client to try to connect to port 32901 on the client host, not the server! Nothing is listening there, of course, so the connection is refused.  11.2.4.2 Using passive mode Note that we had to put the client into passive mode. You will see later that passive mode is beneficial for FTP in general, because it avoids some common firewall and NAT problems. Here, however, it’s used because of a specific FTP SSH problem; if you didn’t, here’s what happens:  $ ftp -d localhost 2001 Connected to localhost. 220 server FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. ---> USER res 331 Password required for res. Password: ---> PASS XXXX 230 User res logged in. ftp> ls ---> PORT 127,0,0,1,11,50 200 PORT command successful. ---> LIST 425 Can't build data connection: Connection refused. ftp>  This is a mirror image of the problem we saw when localhost was the forwarding tar- get, but this time it happens on the client side. The client supplies a socket for the server to connect to, and since it thinks the server is on the local host, that socket is on the loopback address. This causes the server to try connecting to its local host instead of the client machine.  Passive mode can’t always be used: the FTP client or server might not support it, or server-side firewall NAT considerations may prevent it  you’ll see an example of that shortly . If so, you can use the GatewayPorts feature of SSH and solve this problem as we did the previous one: use the host’s real IP address instead of the loopback. To wit:  client% ssh -g -L2001:server:21 server  Then connect to the client machine by name, rather than to localhost:  client% ftp client 2001  422    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   This connects to the SSH proxy on the client’s nonloopback address, causing the FTP client to listen on that address for data connections. The –g option has security implications, however. [9.2.1.1]  Of course, as we mentioned earlier, it’s often the case that active-mode FTP isn’t usable. It’s perfectly possible that your local firewall NAT setup requires passive mode, but you can’t use it. In that case, you’re just out of luck. Put your data on a diskette and contribute to the local bicycle-courier economy.  The various problems we have described, while common, depend on your particular Unix flavor and FTP implementation. For example, some FTP servers fail even before connecting to a loopback socket; they see the client’s PORT command and reject it, printing “illegal PORT command”. If you understand the reasons for the various fail- ure modes, however, you will learn to recognize them in different guises.  11.2.4.3 The “PASV port theft” problem Trying to use FTP with SSH can be sort of like playing a computer dungeon game: you find yourself in a twisty maze of TCP connections, all of which look alike and none of which seem to go where you want. Even if you follow all of our advice so far, and understand and avoid the pitfalls we’ve mentioned, the connection might still fail:  ftp> passive Passive mode on. ftp> ls connecting to 192.168.10.1:6670 Connected to 192.168.10.1 port 6670 425 Possible PASV port theft, cannot open data connection. ! Retrieve of folder listing failed  Assuming you don’t decide to give up entirely and move into a less irritating career, you may want to know, “What now?” The problem here is a security feature of the FTP server, specifically the popular wu-ftpd from Washington University.  See http:   www.wu-ftpd.org . This feature might be implemented in other FTP servers, but we haven’t seen it.  The server accepts an incoming data connection from the client, then notices that its source address isn’t the same as that of the control connection  which was forwarded through SSH and thus comes from the server host . It con- cludes that an attack is in progress! The FTP server believes someone has been moni- toring your FTP control connection, seen the server response to the PASV command containing the listening socket, and jumped in to connect to it before the legitimate client can do so. So, the server drops the connection and reports the suspected “port theft”  see Figure 11-3 .  There’s no way around this problem but to stop the server from performing this check. It’s a problematic feature to begin with, since it prevents not only attacks, but also legitimate FTP operations. For example, passive-mode operation was originally intended to allow an FTP client to effect a file transfer between two remote servers  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

This isn’t a common practice, but it is part of the protocol design, and the “port theft” check of wu-ftpd prevents its use. You can turn it off by recompiling wu-ftpd without FIGHT_PASV_PORT_RACE  use configure --disable-pasvip . You can also leave the check on but allow certain accounts to use alternate IP addresses for data connections, with the pasv-allow and port-allow configuration statements. See the ftpaccess 5  manpage for details. Note that these features are relatively recent additions to wu-ftpd and aren’t in earlier versions.  FTP, Firewalls, and Passive Mode  11.2.5 Recall that in active mode, the FTP data connections go in the opposite direction than you might expect—from the server back to the client. This usual mode of oper- ation  shown in Figure 11-4  often develops problems in the presence of a firewall. Suppose the client is behind a firewall that allows all outbound connections but restricts inbound ones. Then the client can establish a control connection to log in and issue commands, but data-transfer commands such as ls, get, and put will fail, because the firewall blocks the data connections coming back to the client machine. Simple packet-filtering firewalls can’t be configured to allow these connections, because they appear as separate TCP destinations to random ports, with no obvious relation to the established FTP control connection.* The failure might happen  * More sophisticated firewalls can take care of this problem. These products are a cross between an applica- tion-level proxy and a packet filter and are often called “transparent proxies” or “stateful packet filters.” Such a firewall understands the FTP protocol and watches for FTP control connections. When it sees a PORT command issued by an FTP client, it dynamically opens a temporary hole in the firewall, allowing the spec- ified FTP data connection back through. This hole disappears automatically after a short time and can only be between the socket given in the PORT command and the server’s ftp-data socket. These products often also do NAT and can transparently deal with the FTP NAT problems we describe next.  424    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

This depends on whether the firewall explicitly rejects the connection attempt with an ICMP or TCP RST message, or just silently drops the packets. Note that this problem can occur whether or not SSH is forwarding the con- trol connection.

FTP client behind a firewall  Passive mode usually solves this problem, reversing the direction of data connec- tions so they go from the client to the server. Unfortunately, not all FTP client or servers implement passive-mode transfers. Command-line FTP clients generally use the passive command to toggle passive-mode transfers on and off; if it doesn’t recog- nize that command, it probably doesn’t do passive mode. If the client supports pas- sive mode but the server doesn’t, you may see a message like “PASV: command not understood” from the server. PASV is the FTP protocol command that instructs the server to listen for data connections. Finally, even if passive mode solves the firewall problem, it doesn’t help with SSH forwarding, since the ports in question are still dynamically chosen.  Here is an example of the firewall problem, blocking the return data connections:  $ ftp lasciate.ogni.speranza.org Connected to lasciate.ogni.speranza.org 220 ProFTPD 1.2.0pre6 Server  Lasciate FTP Server  [lasciate.ogni.speranza.org] 331 Password required for slade.

However, even when forwarding the FTP control connection through SSH, this problem still applies, since the difficulty is with the data connection, not the control, and those don’t go through SSH. So, this is yet another reason why you will normally want to use pas- sive mode with FTP and SSH.  FTP and Network Address Translation  NAT   11.2.6 Passive-mode transfers can also work around another common problem with FTP: its difficulties with network address translation, or NAT. NAT is the practice of connect- ing two networks by a gateway that rewrites the source and destination addresses of packets as they pass through. One benefit is that you may connect a network to the Internet or change ISPs without having to renumber the network  that is, change all your IP addresses . It also allows sharing a limited number of routable Internet addresses among a larger number of machines on a network using private addresses not routed on the Internet. This flavor of NAT is often called masquerading.  Suppose your FTP client is on a machine with a private address usable only on your local network, and you connect to the Internet through a NAT gateway. The client can establish a control connection to an external FTP server. However, there will be a problem if the client attempts the usual reverse-direction data connections. The cli- ent, ignorant of the NAT gateway, tells the server  via a PORT command  to connect to a socket containing the client’s private address. Since that address isn’t usable on the remote side, the server generally responds “no route to host” and the connection will fail.* Figure 11-5 illustrates this situation. Passive mode gets around this prob- lem as well, since the server never has to connect back to the client and so the cli- ent’s address is irrelevant.  * It could be worse, too. The server could also use private addressing, and if you’re unlucky, the client’s private address might coincidentally match a completely different machine on the server side. It’s unlikely, though, that a server-side machine would happen to listen on the random port picked by your FTP client, so this would probably just generate a “connection refused” error.  426    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Client-side NAT prevents active-mode FTP transfers  So far, we’ve listed three situations requiring passive-mode FTP: control connection forwarding, client inside a firewall, and client behind NAT. Given these potential problems with active-mode FTP, and that there’s no down side to passive mode that we know of, we recommend always using passive-mode FTP if you can.  11.2.6.1 Server-side NAT issues The NAT problem we just discussed was a client-side issue. A more difficult prob- lem can occur if the FTP server is behind a NAT gateway, and you’re forwarding the FTP control connection through SSH.  First, let’s understand the basic problem without SSH in the picture. If the server is behind a NAT gateway, then you have the mirror-image problem to the one dis- cussed earlier. Before, active-mode transfers didn’t work because the client supplied its internal, non-NAT’d address to the server in the PORT command, and this address wasn’t reachable. In the new situation, passive-mode transfers don’t work because the server supplies its internal-only address to the client in the PASV command response, and that address is unreachable to the client  see Figure 11-6 .

Figure 11-6. Server-side NAT prevents passive-mode FTP transfers  The earlier answer was to use passive mode; here the simplest answer is the reverse: use active mode. Unfortunately, this isn’t very helpful. If the server is intended for  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    427   general Net access, it should be made useful to the largest number of people. Since client-side NAT and firewall setups requiring passive-mode FTP are common, it won’t do to use a server-side NAT configuration that requires active mode instead; this makes access impossible. One approach is to use an FTP server with special fea- tures designed to address this very problem. The wu-ftpd server we touched on ear- lier has such a feature. Quoting from the ftpaccess 5  manpage:  passive address          Allows control of the address reported in response to      a PASV command.  When any control connection matching      the   requests a passive data connection  PASV ,      the     address  is  reported.  NOTE: this      does not change the address the daemon actually lis-      tens  on,  only  the  address reported to the client.      This feature allows the daemon to  operate  correctly      behind IP-renumbering firewalls.  For example:  passive address 10.0.1.15   10.0.0.0 8  passive address 192.168.1.5 0.0.0.0 0  Clients  connecting  from  the  class-A network 10 will be told the passive connection  is  listening  on  IP-address 10.0.1.15  while all others will be told the connection is listening on 192.168.1.5  Multiple passive addresses may be specified to handle com- plex, or multi-gatewayed, networks.  This handles the problem quite neatly, unless you happen to be forwarding the FTP control connection through SSH. Site administrators arrange for FTP control connec- tions originating from outside the server’s private network to have external addresses reported in the PASV responses. But the forwarded control connection appears to come from the server host itself, rather than the outside network. Control connec- tions coming from inside the private network should get the internal address, not the external one. The only way this will work is if the FTP server is configured to pro- vide the external address to connections coming from itself as well as from the out- side. This is actually quite workable, as there’s little need in practice to transmit files by FTP from a machine back to itself. You can use this technique to allow control- connection forwarding in the presence of server-side NAT or suggest it to the site administrators if you have this problem.  Another way of addressing the server-side NAT problem is to use an intelligent NAT gateway of the type mentioned earlier. Such a gateway automatically rewrites the FTP control traffic in transit to account for address translation. This is an attractive solution in some respects, because it is automatic and transparent; there is less cus- tom work in setting up the servers behind the gateway, and there are fewer depen- dencies between the server and network configurations. As it happens, though, this solution is actually worse for our purposes than the server-level one. This technique  428    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   relies on the gateway’s ability to recognize and alter the FTP control connection as it passes through. But such manipulation is exactly what SSH is designed to prevent! If the control connection is forwarded through SSH, the gateway doesn’t know there is a control connection, because it’s embedded as a channel inside the SSH session. The control connection isn’t a separate TCP connection of its own; it’s on the SSH port rather than the FTP port. The gateway can’t read it because it’s encrypted, and the gateway can’t modify it even if the gateway can read it, because SSH provides integrity protection. If you’re in this situation—the client must use passive-mode FTP, and the server is behind a NAT gateway doing FTP control traffic rewriting— you must convince the server administrator to use a server-level technique in addi- tion to the gateway, specifically to allow forwarding. Otherwise, it’s not going to happen, and we see trucks filled with tapes in your future, or perhaps HTTP over SSL with PUT commands.  We have now concluded our discussion of forwarding the control connection of FTP, securing your login name, password, and FTP commands. If that’s all you want to do, you are done with this case study. We’re going to continue, however, and delve into the murky depths of data connections. You’ll need a technical back- ground for this material as we cover minute details and little-known modes of FTP.  You might even wonder if we’ve accidentally inserted a portion of an FTP book into the SSH book.  Forward, brave reader!  11.2.7 All About Data Connections Ask most SSH users about forwarding the FTP data connection, and they’ll respond, “Sorry, it’s not possible.” Well, it is possible. The method we’ve discovered is obscure, inconvenient, and not usually worth the effort, but it works. Before we can explain it, we must first discuss the three major ways that FTP accomplishes file transfers between client and server:    The usual method   Passive-mode transfers   Transfers using the default data ports  We’ll just touch briefly on the first two, since we’ve already discussed them; we’ll just amplify with a bit more detail. Then we’ll discuss the third mode, which is the least known and the one you need if you really, really want to forward your FTP data connections.  11.2.7.1 The usual method of ﬁle transfer Most FTP clients attempt data transfers in the following way. After establishing the control connection and authenticating, the user issues a command to transfer a file. Suppose the command is get fichier.txt, which asks to transfer the file fichier.txt from the server to the client. In response to this command, the client selects a free  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    429   local TCP socket, call it C, and starts listening on it. It then issues a PORT command to the FTP server, specifying the socket C. After the server acknowledges this, the cli- ent issues the command RETR fichier.txt, which tells the server to connect to the previously given socket  C  and send the contents of that file over the new data con- nection. The client accepts the connection to C, reads the data, and writes it into a local file also called fichier.txt. When done, the data connection is closed. Here is a transcript of such a session:  $ ftp -d aaor.lionaka.net Connected to aaor.lionaka.net. 220 aaor.lionaka.net FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. ---> USER res 331 Password required for res.

This says the client is listening on IP address 219.243.169.50, port 2530 =  9<<8 +226; the final two integers in the comma-separated list are the 16-bit port number represented as two 8-bit bytes, most significant byte first. The server response beginning with “150” confirms estab- lishment of the data connection to that socket. What isn’t shown is that the source port of that connection is always the standard FTP data port, port 20  remember that FTP servers listen for incoming control connections on port 21 .  There are two important points to note about this process:    The data connection socket is chosen on the fly by the client. This prevents for- warding, since you can’t know the port number ahead of time to forward it with SSH. You can get around this problem by establishing the FTP process “by hand” using telnet. That is, choose a data socket beforehand and forward it with SSH, telnet to the FTP server yourself, and issue all the necessary FTP protocol commands by hand, using your forwarded port in the PORT command. But this can hardly be called convenient.  430    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Remember that the data connection is made in the reverse direction from the control connection; it goes from the server back to the client. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, the usual workaround is to use passive mode.  11.2.7.2 Passive mode in depth Recall that in a passive-mode transfer, the client initiates a connection to the server. Specifically, instead of listening on a local socket and issuing a PORT command to the server, the client issues a PASV command. In response, the server selects a socket on its side to listen on and reveals it to the client in the response to the PASV command. The client then connects to that socket to form the data connection, and issues the file-transfer command over the control connection. With command line–based cli- ents, the usual way to do passive-mode transfers is to use the passive command. Again, an example:  $ ftp -d aaor.lionaka.net Connected to aaor.lionaka.net. 220 aaor.lionaka.net FTP server  SunOS 5.7  ready. ---> USER res 331 Password required for res.

Note that after the user gives the ls command, the client sends PASV instead of PORT. The server responds with the socket on which it will listen. The client issues the LIST command to list the contents of the current remote directory, and connects to the remote data socket; the server accepts and confirms the connection, then transfers the directory listing over the new connection.

All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    431   An interesting historical note, which we alluded to earlier, is that the PASV command wasn’t originally intended for this use; it was designed to let an FTP client direct a file transfer between two remote servers. The client makes control connections to two remote servers, issues a PASV command to one causing it to listen on a socket, issues a PORT command to the other telling it to connect to the other server on that socket, then issues the data-transfer command  STOR, RETR, etc. . These days, most people don’t even know this is possible, and will pull a file from one server to the local machine, and transfer it again to get it to the second remote machine. It’s so uncommon that many FTP clients don’t support this mode, and some servers pre- vent its use for security reasons. [11.2.4.3]  11.2.7.3 FTP with the default data ports The third file-transfer mode occurs if the client issues neither a PORT nor a PASV com- mand. In this case, the server initiates the data connection from the well-known ftp- data port  20  to the source socket of the control connection, on which the client must be listening  these sockets are the “default data ports” for the FTP session . The usual way to use this mode is with the FTP client command sendport, which switches on and off the client’s feature of using a PORT command for each data transfer. For this mode, we want it turned off, and it is generally on by default. So, the sequence of steps is this:  1. The client initiates the control connection from local socket C to server:21. 2. The user gives the sendport command, and then a data-transfer command, such as put or ls. The FTP client begins listening on socket C for an incoming TCP connection.  3. The server determines the socket C at the other end of the control connection. It doesn’t need the client to send this explicitly via the FTP protocol, since it can just ask TCP for it  e.g., with the getpeername    sockets API routine . It then opens a connection from its ftp-data port to C, and sends or receives the requested data over that connection.  Now, this is certainly a simpler way of doing things than using a different socket for each data transfer, and so it begs the question of why PORT commands are the norm. If you try this out, you will discover why. First off, it might fail on the client side with the message “bind: Address already in use”. And even if it does work, it does so only once. A second ls elicits another address-related error, this time from the server:  aaor% ftp syrinx.lionaka.net Connected to syrinx.lionaka.net. 220 syrinx.lionaka.net FTP server  Version wu-2.5.0 1  Tue Sep 21 16:48:12 EDT 331 Password required for res.

In this scenario, every data connection is between the same two sockets, server:ftp-data and C. Since a TCP connection is fully specified by the pair of source and destination sockets, these con- nections are indistinguishable as far as TCP is concerned; they are different incarna- tions of the same connection and can’t exist at the same time. In fact, to guarantee that packets belonging to two different incarnations of a connection aren’t confused, there’s a waiting period after one incarnation is closed, during which a new incarna- tion is forbidden. In the jargon of TCP, on the side that performed an “active close” of the connection, the connection remains in a state called TIME_WAIT. This state lasts for a period that is supposed to be twice the maximum possible lifetime of a packet in the network  or “2MSL,” for two times the Maximum Segment Lifetime . After that, the connection becomes fully closed, and another incarnation can occur. The actual value of this timeout varies from system to system, but is generally in the range of 30 seconds to 4 minutes.*  As it happens, some TCP implementations enforce even stronger restrictions. Often, a port that is part of a socket in the TIME_WAIT state is unavailable for use, even as part of a connection to a different remote socket. We have also run into systems that disallow listening on a socket that is currently an endpoint of some connection, regardless of the connection state. These restrictions aren’t required by the TCP pro- tocol, but they are common. Such systems usually provide a way to avoid the restric- tions, such as the SO_REUSEADDR option of the Berkeley sockets API. An FTP client generally uses this feature, of course, but it doesn’t always work!  This address-reuse problem comes up in two places in a default-port FTP transfer. The first one is when the client must start listening on its default data port, which by definition is currently the local endpoint of its control connection. Some systems simply don’t allow this, even if the program requests address reuse; that’s why the attempt might fail immediately with the message, “address already in use.”  The other place is on a second data transfer. When the first transfer is finished, the server closes the data connection, and that connection on the server side moves into the TIME_WAIT state. If you try another data transfer before the 2MSL period has elapsed, the server tries to set up another incarnation of the same connection, and it  * See TCP IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols, by W. Richard Stevens  Addison Wesley , for more techni-  cal information about the TIME_WAIT state.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    433   will fail saying “cannot assign requested address.” This happens regardless of the address reuse setting, since the rules of the TCP require it. You can transfer a file again within a few minutes, of course, but most computer users aren’t good at wait- ing a few seconds, let alone minutes. It is this problem that prompts the use of a PORT command for every transfer; since one end of the connection is different every time, the TIME_WAIT collisions don’t occur.  Because of these problems, the default-port transfer mode isn’t generally used. It has, however, an important property for us: it is the only mode in which the data connec- tion destination port is fixed and knowable before the data-transfer command is given. With this knowledge, some patience, and a fair amount of luck, it is possible to forward your FTP data connections through SSH.  Forwarding the Data Connection  11.2.8 With all the foregoing discussion in mind, here we simply state the sequence of steps to set up data-connection forwarding. One caveat is that SSH must request address reuse from TCP for forwarded ports. Tectia and OpenSSH do this already, but not all SSH clients may.  Another issue is that the operating system in which the FTP client is running must allow a process to listen on a socket already in use as the endpoint of an existing con- nection. Some don’t. To test this, try an FTP data transfer on the default data ports without SSH, just by using ftp as usual but giving the sendport command before ls, get, or whatever. If you get:   ftp: bind: Address already in use  then your operating system probably won’t cooperate. There may be a way to alter this behavior; check the operating system documentation. Figure 11-7 illustrates the following steps:  1. Start an SSH connection to forward the control channel as shown earlier in this chapter, and connect with the FTP client. Make sure that passive mode is off.

That’s OK, because there won’t be any PORT or PASV commands with addresses that can be wrong.  2. Now, we need to determine the real and proxy default data ports for the FTP cli-  ent. On the client side, you can do this with netstat:  client% netstat -n  grep 2001 tcp        0      0 client:2001 client:3175 ESTABLISHED tcp        0      0 client:3175 client:2001 ESTABLISHED  This shows that the source of the control connection from the FTP client to SSH is port 3175. You can do the same thing on the server side, but this time you need to know what’s connected to the FTP server port  netstat –n  egrep ‘\ ’ , and there may be many things connected to it. If you have a tool like lsof, it’s better to find out the pid of the ftpd or sshd serving your connection and use lsof –p   to find the port number. If not, you can do a netstat before connecting via FTP and then one right afterward, and try to see which is the new connection. Let’s suppose you’re the only one using the FTP server, and you get it this way:  server% netstat  grep ftp tcp        0      0 server:32714 server:ftp   ESTABLISHED tcp        0      0 server:ftp   server:32714 ESTABLISHED  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.2 FTP and SSH    435   So now, we have the FTP client’s default data port  3175 , and the source port of the forwarded control connection to the FTP server  32714 , which we’ll call the proxy default data port; it is what the FTP server thinks is the client’s default data port.  3. Now, forward the proxy default data port to the real one:    OpenSSH client% ssh -f -n -R32714:localhost:3175 server sleep 10000 &   Tectia client% ssh -f -R32714:localhost:3175 server  If, as we mentioned earlier, you don’t replace sshd or run a second one, then you’d use the modified ssh on the server in the other direction, like this:  server% . ssh -f -n -L32714:localhost:3175 client sleep 10000 &  4. Now, try a data-transfer command with ftp. If all goes well, it should work once,  then fail with this message from the FTP server:  425 Can't build data connection: Address already in use.   Some FTP servers return that error immediately; others will retry several times before giving up, so it may take a while for that error to appear.  If you wait for the server’s 2MSL timeout period, you can do another single data transfer. You can use netstat to see the problem and track its progress:  server% netstat  grep 32714 127.0.0.1.32714     127.0.0.1.21         32768      0 32768      0 ESTABLISHED 127.0.0.1.21        127.0.0.1.32714      32768      0 32768      0 ESTABLISHED 127.0.0.1.20        127.0.0.1.32714      32768      0 32768      0 TIME_WAIT  The first two lines show the established control connection on port 21; the third one shows the old data connection to port 20, now in the TIME_WAIT state. When that disappears, you can do another data-transfer command.  And there you have it: you have forwarded an FTP data connection through SSH. You have achieved the Holy Grail of FTP with SSH, though perhaps you agree with us and Sir Gawain that “it’s only a model.” Still, if you’re terribly concerned about your data connections, have no other way to transfer files, can afford to wait a few minutes between file transfers, and are quite lucky, then this will work. It also makes a great parlor trick at geek parties.  11.3 Pine, IMAP, and SSH Pine is a popular, Unix-based email program from the University of Washington  http:  www.washington.edu pine  . In addition to handling mail stored and delivered  436    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   in local files, Pine also supports IMAP* for accessing remote mailboxes and SMTP† for posting mail.  In this case study, we integrate Pine and SSH to solve two common problems:  IMAP authentication  In many cases, IMAP permits a password to be sent in the clear over the net- work. We discuss how to protect your password using SSH, but  surprisingly  not by port forwarding.  Restricted mail relaying  Many ISPs permit their mail and news servers to be accessed only by their cus- tomers. In some circumstances, this restriction may prevent you from legiti- mately relaying mail through your ISP. Once again, SSH comes to the rescue.  We also discuss techniques to avoid Pine connection delays and facilitate access to multiple servers and mailboxes, including the use of a Pine-specific SSH connection script. This discussion will delve into more detail than the previous one on Pine SSH integration. [4.5.3]  Securing IMAP Authentication  11.3.1 Like SSH, IMAP is a client server protocol. Your email program  e.g., Pine  is the cli- ent, and an IMAP server process  e.g., imapd  runs on a remote machine, the IMAP host, to control access to your remote mailbox. Also like SSH, IMAP generally requires you to authenticate before accessing your mailbox, typically by password. Unfortunately, in some cases this password is sent to the IMAP host in the clear over the network; this represents a security risk  see Figure 11-8 .‡  Pine  ... 0 LOGIN slade password ...  exposed!  TCP  IMAP protocol  mail.isp.net  IMAP Server  inbox = {email.isp.net imap user=slade}inbox  Figure 11-8. A normal IMAP connection  There’s no longer any good reason for this. Years ago, security options were rarely available in IMAP software; these days, however, they’re common and should be  * Internet Message Access Protocol, RFC-2060. † Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, RFC-821. ‡ IMAP does support more secure methods of authentication, but they aren’t widely deployed.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.3 Pine, IMAP, and SSH    437   used! There are standard ways to secure IMAP traffic using SSL or Kerberos. With SSL, the entire IMAP session is protected, so even plain password authentication can be used relatively securely. Kerberos can provide secure authentication and single- signon with or without session encryption; for example, the Apple Mail client imple- ments both. Pine uses Kerberos only for authentication, not encryption—but you can combine Kerberos with SSL to get both single-signon and privacy. Note the power of having multiple independent and standards-based options available! Nonetheless, it is still all too common to encounter IMAP servers with no security features; here, we show you how to address this problem with SSH.  If your mail server is sealed—that is, your only access to it is via the IMAP proto- col—then there’s nothing you can do to improve security using SSH. However, if you can also log into the IMAP server host via SSH, you have options. Because IMAP is a TCP IP-based protocol, one approach is to use SSH port forwarding between the machine running Pine and the IMAP host  see Figure 11-9 . [9.2.1]  inbox = {localhost:2001 imap user=slade}inbox  Pine  2001  SSH  IMAP in SSH  0 LOGIN slade password  IMAP Server  143  SSH  Figure 11-9. Forwarding an IMAP connection  However, this technique has two drawbacks:  Security risk  On a multiuser machine, any other user can connect to your forwarded port. [9.2.4.3] If you use forwarding only to protect your password, this isn’t a big deal, since at worst, an interloper could access a separate connection to the IMAP server having nothing to do with your connection. On the other hand, if port forwarding is permitting you to access an IMAP server behind a firewall, an interloper can breach the firewall by hijacking your forwarded port, a more serious security risk.  Inconvenience  In this setup, you must authenticate twice: first to the SSH server on the IMAP host  to connect and to create the tunnel  and then to the IMAP server by pass- word  to access your mailbox . This is redundant and annoying.  438    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Fortunately, we can address both of these drawbacks and run Pine over SSH securely and conveniently.  11.3.1.1 Pine and preauthenticated IMAP There are two broad types of Unix-based IMAP servers, exemplified by the Univer- sity of Washington  UW  imapd and the Carnegie Mellon Cyrus software. Cyrus is a self-contained system: it uses an internal database to hold user mail, and the only access to it is via the IMAP protocol or particular programs for mail delivery or administration. In particular, there is no relationship between Unix accounts on the server host, and IMAP accounts; they are completely separate.  The UW imapd, on the other hand, is a lighter-weight affair: it simply provides an IMAP view of the traditional Unix mail store: files in  var spool mail or elsewhere, owned by the Unix accounts of the mail recipients. Thus, its notion of user account and access control is tied to that of the host. If your mail is stored in a spool file owned by you, and you can log into the host via SSH, then you’ve already proven you have access to that file—why should you have to prove it again to the IMAP server? In fact, with the UW server, you don’t have to. We now discuss how to do this with UW imapd, or another IMAP server with similar behavior.  The IMAP protocol defines two modes in which an IMAP server can start: normal and preauthenticated  see Figure 11-10 . Normally, imapd runs with special privi- leges to access any user’s mailbox  as when started as root by inetd , and hence it requires authentication from the client.  slade’s mailbox  imapd remote command  pre-authenticated as slade  “exec imapd”  Pine  "ssh -q -l slade exec imapd"  ssh  subprocess  IMAP in SSH PREAUTH  SSH Server  Figure 11-10. Pine IMAP over SSH, preauthenticated  Here’s a sample session that invokes an IMAP server, imapd, through inetd so that it runs as root:  server% telnet localhost imap * OK localhost IMAP4rev1 v12.261 server ready  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.3 Pine, IMAP, and SSH    439   0 login res password' 1 select inbox * 3 EXISTS * 0 RECENT * OK [UIDVALIDITY 964209649] UID validity status * OK [UIDNEXT 4] Predicted next UID * FLAGS  \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen  * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS  \* \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen ] Permanent flags 1 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed 2 logout * BYE imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 server terminating connection 2 OK LOGOUT completed  Alternatively, in preauthenticated mode, the IMAP server assumes that authentica- tion has already been done by the program that started the server and that it already has the necessary rights to access the user’s mailbox. If you invoke imapd on the command line under a nonroot uid, imapd skips the authentication phase and sim- ply opens the mailbox file of the current account  which must be accessible via the existing Unix permissions structure . You can then type IMAP commands and access your mailbox without authentication:  server%  usr local sbin imapd * PREAUTH imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 v12.261 server ready 0 select inbox * 3 EXISTS * 0 RECENT * OK [UIDVALIDITY 964209649] UID validity status * OK [UIDNEXT 4] Predicted next UID * FLAGS  \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen  * OK [PERMANENTFLAGS  \* \Answered \Flagged \Deleted \Draft \Seen ] Permanent flags 0 OK [READ-WRITE] SELECT completed 1 logout * BYE imap.example.com IMAP4rev1 server terminating connection 1 OK LOGOUT completed  Notice the PREAUTH response at the beginning of the session, indicating preauthenti- cated mode. It is followed by the command select inbox, which causes the IMAP server implicitly to open the inbox of the current user without demanding authentication. Now, how does all this relate to Pine? Pine has a built-in feature whereby, instead of using a direct IMAP connection, it logs into the IMAP host using ssh and runs a pre- authenticated instance of imapd directly. If this succeeds, Pine then converses with the IMAP server over the SSH connection, and has automatic access to the remote inbox without further authentication.  11.3.1.2 Making Pine use SSH Pine’s SSH feature is controlled by three configuration variables in the ~ .pinerc file: ssh-path, ssh-command, and ssh-open-timeout. ssh-path stores the program name for opening a Unix remote shell connection. The default should point to a usable SSH program, but you may have to set it yourself:  ssh-path= usr bin ssh  440    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ssh-command represents the Unix command line for opening the SSH connection. The value is a printf-style format string with four “%s” conversion specifications that are automatically filled in at runtime. From first to last, these four specifications stand for:  1. The value of ssh-path 2. The remote hostname 3. The remote username 4. The connection method; in this case, “imap”  The default value of ssh-command is:  "%s %s -l %s exec  etc r%sd"  To access the mailbox on imap.example.com for user smith via SSH, Pine would then run the command:   usr bin ssh imap.example.com -l smith exec  etc rimapd  This follows a convention, somewhat antiquated nowadays, of having links named  etc r d that point to servers for various protocols that operate in this preauthenticated fashion. In modern systems such links are usually not available, so you may need to alter the ssh-command to run imapd. You can also use it to add other options, like so:  ssh-command="%s %s -l %s -o BatchMode=yes -axq exec  usr sbin imapd"  With this setting, Pine would end up running this command:   usr bin ssh imap.example.com -l -o BatchMode=yes -axq exec  usr sbin imapd  The –q  Quiet  option is advisable so that ssh doesn’t emit warning messages that may confuse Pine, which would try to interpret them as part of the IMAP protocol. The options -ax turns off agent and X Windows forwarding, which might be on by default but are not necessary for this connection. BatchMode lets ssh know that it can’t prompt the user for a password on the terminal, since Pine is using it.  The third variable, ssh-open-timeout, sets the number of seconds Pine will wait for the SSH connection to succeed; its default value is 15. A value of 0 disables SSH entirely, which may be useful if the feature is on by default and you do not want to use it.  So, finally, the Pine configuration is:  ssh-path= usr bin ssh ssh-command="%s %s -l %s -o BatchMode=yes -axq exec  usr sbin imapd" ssh-open-timeout=15  Generally, you want to use an SSH authentication method that doesn’t require typ- ing a password or passphrase, such as hostbased or public-key with an agent. SSH is run behind the scenes by Pine and doesn’t have access to the terminal to prompt you. If you’re running the X Window System, ssh can instead pop up an X widget—  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.3 Pine, IMAP, and SSH    441   Remote Usernames in Pine  By the way, it’s not mentioned in the Pine manpage or configuration file comments, but if you need to specify a different username for connecting to a remote mailbox, the syntax is:  {hostname user=jane}mailbox  This causes Pine to call the ssh-command with “jane” as the remote username  i.e., the third %s substitution .  ssh-askpass—to get input, but you probably don’t want that either. Pine may make several separate IMAP connections in the course of reading your mail, even if it’s all on the same server, and this will cause repeated queries for your password.  With the given settings in your ~ .pinerc file and the right kind of SSH authentica- tion in place, you’re ready to try Pine over SSH. Just start Pine and open your remote mailbox; if all goes well, it will open without prompting for a password.  11.3.2 Mail Relaying and News Access Pine uses IMAP to read mail but not to send it. For that, it can either call a local pro- gram  such as sendmail   or use an SMTP server. Pine can also be a newsreader and use NNTP  the Network News Transfer Protocol, RFC-977  to contact a news server.  An ISP commonly provides NNTP and SMTP servers for its customers, but obvi- ously does not want to allow arbitrary people to use them. Modern extensions to the NNTP and SMTP protocols include authentication, and ISPs are starting to use and require them. Before such mechanisms were available, however, the usual method of restricting access to these services was via network address: the ISP would allow access from addresses within its own network  and hence hopefully only from its customers . Many ISPs have not yet switched to direct authentication for these ser- vices, and are still using address-based authorization; so, if you’re connected to the Internet from elsewhere and try to use your ISP’s mail server, the attempt might fail. Access to your usual servers might be blocked by a firewall, or the mail server might reject your mail with a message about “no relaying,” and the news server rejects you with a message about “unauthorized use.”  You are authorized to use the services, of course, so what do you do? Use SSH port forwarding! By forwarding your SMTP and NNTP connections over an SSH session to a machine inside the ISP’s network, your connections appear to come from that machine, thus bypassing the address-based restrictions. You can use separate SSH commands to forward each port:  442    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   $ ssh -L2025:localhost:25 smtp-server ... $ ssh -L2119:localhost:119 nntp-server ...  Alternatively, if you have a shell account on one of the ISP’s machines running SSH but can’t log into the mail or news servers directly, do this:  $ ssh -L2025:smtp-server:25 -L2119:nntp-server:119 shell-server ...  or neatly automate it this way:  [~ .ssh config] Host mail-news-forwarding   Hostname shell-server   LocalForward 2025 smtp-server:25   LocalForward 2119 nntp-server:119  $ ssh mail-news-forwarding  This is an off-host forwarding, and thus the last leg of the forwarded path isn’t pro- tected by SSH. [9.2.4] But since the reason for this forwarding isn’t so much protec- tion as it is bypassing the source-address restriction, that’s OK. Your mail messages and news postings are going to be transferred insecurely once you drop them off, anyway.  If you want security for them, you need to sign or encrypt them separately, e.g., with PGP or S MIME.   In any case, now configure Pine to use the forwarded ports by setting the smtp-server and nntp-server configuration options in your ~ .pinerc file:  smtp-server=localhost:2025 nntp-server=localhost:2119  Even if your ISP uses direct authentication, you might choose to use SSH anyway if it does so poorly. For instance, some badly deployed services require password authen- tication but do not provide encryption for the connection! In this case, you would forward over SSH in order to protect your password.  One possible complication: the SSH feature has a global on off switch, applying to every remote mailbox. That is, if ssh-open-timeout is nonzero, Pine tries to use this style of access for every remote mailbox. If you have multiple mailboxes but only some of them are accessible via SSH imapd, this leads to annoyance. Pine falls back to a direct TCP connection if SSH fails to get an IMAP connection, but you have to wait for it to fail. If the server in question is behind a firewall silently blocking the SSH port, this can be a lengthy delay. If you’re in this situation, you can disable SSH access for specific mailboxes using the  norsh switch, like this:  {imap.example.com user=smith norsh}inbox  That’s not a typo: the switch is  norsh rather than  nossh. This is just an historical artifact of the software: originally, Pine supported this style of mailbox access via rsh. In fact, there are still configuration variables—rsh-path, rsh-command, and rsh-open- timeout—that function entirely analogously; so much so, that in the first edition of this book, we described how to use SSH with older versions of Pine by simply setting  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.3 Pine, IMAP, and SSH    443   rsh-command to “ssh”. Anyway,  norsh turns off the use of both the ssh or rsh features of Pine for the mailbox in question.  11.3.3 Using a Connection Script The Pine configuration option ssh-path can point not only to ssh, but also to any other program: most usefully, a script you’ve written providing any needed customi- zations. If your needs are complex, you might have to do this. For example, the ssh- path setting is global to all mailboxes, but perhaps the imapd executable is in differ- ent locations on different servers you want to access. You can solve this problem with a script which takes the four ssh-command arguments from Pine, and does the right thing depending on which server is specified:  ssh-path= home smith bin my-pine-ssh-script ssh-command="%s %s %s %s"  where the script my-pine-ssh-script is:  ! bin sh  ssh=$1 server=$2 user=$3 method=$4  prefix="exec $ssh -qax $user@$server exec"  case $server in     mail.work.com  $prefix  usr sbin imapd ;;      imap.isp.net  $prefix  usr local sbin imapd ;;                 *  exit 0 esac  The default action of exit will cause Pine to skip SSH access quickly for servers other than the two mentioned.  11.4 Connecting Through a Gateway Host All along we’ve assumed that your outgoing connectivity is unlimited: that you can establish any outgoing TCP connection you desire. Even our discussions of firewalls have assumed that they restrict only incoming traffic. In more secure  or simply more regimented  environments, this might not be the case: in fact, you might not have direct IP connectivity at all to the outside world.  In the corporate world, companies commonly require all outgoing connections to pass through a proxy server or gateway host: a machine connected to both the com- pany network and the outside. Although connected to both networks, a gateway host doesn’t act as a router, and the networks remain separated. Rather, it allows limited, application-level access between the two networks.  444    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   In this case study, we discuss issues of SSH in this environment:    Connecting transparently to external hosts using chained SSH commands   Making scp connections to these hosts   Running SSH-within-SSH by port forwarding   Running SSH-within-SSH by ProxyCommand  These gateway techniques apply equally well when the situation is reversed: you’re on an external machine, and need to access various internal hosts through a single SSH gateway.  11.4.1 Making Transparent SSH Connections Suppose your company has a gateway host, G, which is your only gateway to the Internet. You are logged into a client host, C, and want to reach a server host, S, out- side the company network, as shown in Figure 11-11. We assume that all three machines have SSH installed.  private corporate  network  C  G  Internet  S  To make a connection from client C to server S now requires two steps:  Figure 11-11. Proxy gateway  1. Connect from C to gateway G:   Execute on client C $ ssh G  2. Connect from G to server S:   Execute on gateway G $ ssh S  This works, and using agent forwarding and public-key authentication on both hosts, you can avoid a second authentication prompt on gateway G.  Now, an obvious simplification would be this single command:  $ ssh G ssh S  If you do this, though, you’ll have a problem: first, you’ll see this warning:  Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.  11.4 Connecting Through a Gateway Host    445  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   ...and next, your shell on S will behave very strangely! You won’t get a prompt, or any fancy line-editing—but if you persist and enter some commands, they will get executed. The problem is that ssh only creates a pseudo-terminal, needed for interac- tive terminal-based programs, if you explicitly request a remote shell session; to ssh, this means that you do not specify a remote program to run. By default, it assigns no terminal when running remote commands like ssh host uname -a. Most of the time this is a reasonable default, but sometimes you’ll run a remote command that actu- ally needs a terminal—in this case, the shell! You can fix this with the –t switch for force a pseudo-terminal:  $ ssh -t G ssh S  But this introduces yet another messy aspect: to reach hosts through the gateway, you not only have to use double-ssh commands, but furthermore, specify –t in some cases but not others. Not a big burden for occasional use, perhaps, but cumbersome if large numbers of hosts or automation are involved.  Fortunately, SSH configuration is flexible enough to afford a neat solution, which we now present using OpenSSH features and syntax.* We use public-key authentication to take advantage of the options of the authorized_keys file, and ssh-agent with agent forwarding so that authentication passes on transparently to the second SSH connec- tion  see Figure 11-12 .  C  G  ssh  run "ssh S"  sshd  "ssh S"  S  ssh  run a shell  sshd  shell  Figure 11-12. Chained SSH connections through a proxy gateway  Suppose your account on gateway G is gilligan, and on server S it is skipper. First, set up your SSH client configuration file so that the name S is a nickname for accessing your account on gateway G:   ~ .ssh config on client C  * The same method should work with Tectia: just adapt the client configuration to Tectia syntax. [7.1.2.3]  446    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   host S   hostname G   user gilligan  Next, on gateway G, associate a forced command with your chosen key to invoke an SSH connection to server S: [8.2.3]    ~ .ssh authorized_keys on gateway G command="ssh -l skipper S" ...key..  Now, when you invoke the command ssh S on client C, it connects to gateway G, runs the forced command automatically, and establishes a second SSH session to server S. And thanks to agent forwarding, authentication from G to S happens automatically, assuming you’ve loaded the appropriate key. This can be the same key you used to access gilligan@G or a different one.*  This trick not only provides a transparent connection from client C to server S, it also sidesteps the fact that the name S might not have any meaning on client C. Often in this kind of network situation, your internal network naming scheme is cut off from the outside world  e.g., split DNS with internal roots . After all, what’s the point of allowing you to name hosts you can’t reach? Thanks to the Host configuration key- word for SSH clients, you can create a nickname S that instructs SSH to reach that host transparently via G. [7.1.2.5]  You’ll soon notice a problem, though. Interactive logins work fine, but remote com- mands are ignored! And worse, the missing terminal problem rears its head again:  $ ssh S echo Hello Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.  You’re left talking to a mute shell, and no “Hello” appears. The problem now is that we’ve done nothing to pass along any remote command to S; the forced command on G simply ignores it and always tries to start a remote-login SSH connection  hence provoking the missing terminal problem, as before . We can fix this using another OpenSSH feature:†  command="ssh -l skipper S $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" ...key...  If a remote command is used, sshd stores it in the environment variable SSH_ ORIGINAL_COMMAND; we use that here to pass it along to the next ssh command. The variable is not set, however, if there is no remote command. Some shells consider this an error, so you might have to augment this in some way to accommodate the shell’s predilections. For example, some shells have this syntax:  command="ssh -l skipper S ${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND:-}" ...key...  * Note that if you want to use this setup for an interactive connection, you need to use the –t option to ssh, to force it to allocate a tty on G. It doesn’t normally do that, because it doesn’t have any way to know that the remote command—in this case, another instance of ssh—needs one.  † For Tectia use SSH2_ORIGINAL_COMMAND.  11.4 Connecting Through a Gateway Host    447  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   where ${foo:-bar} evaluates to “bar” if the variable foo is not set. And remember, the shell used here is the one belonging to the remote account; to be especially robust, it might be best to use a particular shell explicitly:  command=" bin bash -c 'ssh -l skipper S ${SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND:-}'" ...key...  This technique also neatly solves the “missing terminal” problem at the same time!  11.4.2 Using SCP Through a Gateway Recall that the command:  $ scp ... S:file ...  actually runs ssh in a subprocess to connect to S and invoke a remote scp server. [3.7] Now that we’ve gotten ssh working from client C to server S, you’d expect that scp would work between these machines with no further effort. Well, it almost does, but it wouldn’t be software if there weren’t a small problem to work around, in this case authentication. You can’t provide a password or passphrase to the second ssh pro- gram, since there is no pseudo-terminal on the first ssh session—ssh requires a termi- nal for user input. So, you need a form of authentication that doesn’t require user input: either hostbased, or public-key authentication with agent forwarding. Host- based works as is, so if you plan to use it, you can skip to the next section. Public-key authentication, however, may have a problem: some versions of scp run ssh with the –a switch to disable agent forwarding. [6.3.5.3] You need to reenable agent forwarding for this to work, and this is surprisingly tricky.  Normally, you could turn on agent forwarding in your client configuration file:   ~ .ssh config on client C, but this FAILS ForwardAgent yes  but this doesn’t help because as it happens, the –a on the command line takes prece- dence. Alternatively, you might try the –o option of scp, which can pass along options to ssh, such as –o ForwardAgent yes. But in this case, scp places the –a after any –o options it passes where it takes precedence, so that doesn’t work either.  There is a solution, though. scp has a –S option to indicate a path to the SSH client program it should use, so you create a “wrapper” script that tweaks the SSH com- mand line as needed, and then make scp use it with –S. Place the following script in an executable file on client C—say, ~ bin ssh-wrapper:  ! usr bin perl exec ' usr bin ssh', map {$_ eq '-a' ?     : $_} @ARGV;  This runs the real ssh, removing –a from the command line if it’s there. Now, give your scp a command like this:  scp -S ~ bin ssh-wrapper ... S:file ...  and it should work.  448    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.4.3 Another Approach: SSH-in-SSH  Port Forwarding  Instead of using a forced command, here’s another way to connect by SSH through a gateway: forward a port on client C to the SSH server on S, using an SSH session from C to G, and then run a second SSH session through the first  see Figure 11-13 .  C  ssh -L 2001:S:22 G  SSH  G  SSH Server  S  SSH Server  SSH  2001  SSH  "ssh localhost 2001"  Figure 11-13. Forwarded SSH connection through a proxy gateway  That is:   Execute on client C $ ssh -L2001:S:22 G   Execute on client C in a different shell $ ssh -p 2001 -o HostKeyAlias=S localhost  This connects to server S by carrying the second SSH connection  from C to S  inside a port-forwarding channel of the first  from C to G . Note the use of HostKeyAlias, so ssh will look up S’s host key with the name “S.” Otherwise, it would try to use the key for “localhost,” which would be the wrong key.  You can make this more transparent by creating a nickname S in your client configu- ration file:   ~ .ssh config on client C Host S   Hostname localhost   Port 2001   HostKeyAlias S  Now the earlier commands become:   Execute on client C $ ssh -L2001:S:22 G   Execute on client C in a different shell $ ssh S  11.4 Connecting Through a Gateway Host    449  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Because this technique requires a separate, manual step to establish the port for- warding, it is less transparent than the one in [11.4.1]. However, it has some advan- tages. If you plan to use port or X forwarding between C and S with the first method, it’s a little complicated. scp not only gives the –a switch to ssh to turn off agent for- warding, but also it gives –x and –o “ClearAllForwardings yes”, turning off X and port forwarding. So, you need to modify the earlier wrapper script to remove these unwanted options as well. [11.4.2] Then, for port forwarding you need to set up a chain of forwarded ports that connect to one another. For example, to forward port 2017 on client C to port 143  the IMAP port  on server S:   ~ .ssh config on client C host S   hostname G   user gilligan   ~ .ssh authorized_keys on gateway G command="ssh -L1234:localhost:143 skipper@S" ...key...   Execute on client C $ ssh -L2017:localhost:1234 S  This works, but it’s difficult to understand, error-prone, and fragile: if you trigger the TIME_WAIT problem [9.2.9.1], you have to edit files and redo the tunnel just to pick a new ephemeral port to replace 1234.  Using the SSH-in-SSH technique instead, your port and X-forwarding options oper- ate directly between client C and server S in the usual, straightforward manner. The preceding example becomes:   ~ .ssh config on client C Host S   Hostname localhost   Port 2001   HostKeyAlias S   Execute on client C $ ssh -L2001:S:22 G   Execute on client C in a different shell $ ssh -L2017:localhost:143 S  This final command connects to server S, forwarding local port 2017 to the IMAP port on S.  SSH-in-SSH with a Proxy Command  OpenSSH   11.4.4 Here’s yet another way to implement the tunneled SSH technique:   ~ .ssh config on client C Host S   ProxyCommand "ssh -qax G nc S 22"  450    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   If a ProxyCommand value is set, OpenSSH uses this command to get a communication channel to the remote host, rather than using the network directly. The command, in turn, can do anything at all—it could connect to an SSH server at the other end of a serial line, for example! In this case, we actually use a second ssh command to connect through gateway G to the SSH server TCP port on server S. The trick is that we really want a kind of connection that OpenSSH doesn’t provide. Ideally, we’d like to be able to say something like ssh --tcp S:22 G  note: this syntax does not currently exist , the meaning of which would be: “connect to G via SSH, instruct G to make a TCP connec- tion to host S port 22, and connect the local stdin stdout to that stream.” Making remote TCP connections is already something sshd can do; that’s how local TCP for- warding is done. Unfortunately, no SSH clients we know of provide this useful feature. So, we must have a separate program on G, which just makes a simple TCP connec- tion for us; here, we use netcat  nc .  Expanding on this a bit...instead of a single host on the other side of the gateway, suppose you have many you want to access. If their names follow a pattern, you may be able to express this behavior very succinctly using OpenSSH. Suppose the machines in question are a cluster with hostnames beowulf-1, beowulf-1, etc. Then you can use this:   ~ .ssh config on client C Host beowulf-*   ProxyCommand "ssh -qax G nc %h %p"  This Host directive will match any of the cluster hostnames, and use an ssh subpro- cess to reach the host in question through the gateway: OpenSSH substitutes the %h and %p in the ProxyCommand with the host and port to use.  The ProxyCommand technique is simpler than port forwarding: there’s no extra SSH command to start separately and no ad hoc port numbers to coordinate and possibly have to change. It also gains in security, since port forwarding always has the prob- lem of unauthenticated access to the forwarded connection. And, we need no HostKeyAlias statements. However, we lose the speed advantage gained over chained ssh commands, since once again we end up waiting for two SSH connections every time. A compromise approach would be to use the ProxyCommand method together with an OpenSSH connection server. [7.4.4.2]  Comparing the Techniques  11.4.5 We’ve presented several methods of SSH access through a gateway. There are vari- ous trade-offs, but overall we think tunneling is usually the best way to go. Here’s why.  11.4.5.1 Smoothness The tunneling methods are smoother end-to-end: the interaction between client C and server S is simpler because they talk directly to one another. This is especially  11.4 Connecting Through a Gateway Host    451  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   true if you need to request additional services via SSH, such as any kind of forward- ing. On the other hand, the setup for tunneled connections using port forwarding is more cumbersome with its extra SSH process. ProxyCommand tunneling, though, is both smoother than chaining and at least no slower—and may be sped up if the OpenSSH connection server is available. The speedup is again at the cost of an extra SSH process, but its startup could be automated, and coordinating the control socket is easier than picking ad hoc ports and dealing with possible TIME_WAIT problems. Overall, tunneling via ProxyCommand wins.  11.4.5.2 Security A chained connection has a serious security problem: the gateway G. All data is decrypted on G in between the two SSH sessions; if G is compromised, then all is lost. There is simply no end-to-end security in this scenario, because there is no actual SSH session from client C to server S. In contrast, a compromise of G poses no extra threat to the security of a tunneled SSH connection from C to S. The break-in simply puts the attacker on G in the position of altering or diverting the data path between C and S—but SSH already has mechanisms for countering exactly that threat. In other words, the top SSH connection does not trust the lower one at all. It treats it as it would any other connection method, and thus is no more vulnerable to attacks on it than if a simple TCP connection were in use. Tunneling in either form is the clear winner here.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH One of the main strengths of SSH is easy setup. Install an SSH server on one host and a client on another, and you immediately have secure login via password. Generate a key pair and put the public key on the server, and you immediately have even better authentication, and single-signon. This lightweight approach is one of the main rea- sons for the initial popularity of SSH.  No solution fits all situations, however, and this simplicity becomes a liability as the number of users and hosts grows. In large installations, managing both server and user authentication becomes difficult. Every time you add an SSH server host, or change its name, or add an alias for it, you must update the global known-hosts list. This by itself may be a practically impossible task, because there are no standards for representing these lists. OpenSSH uses one format, Tectia another; some Windows- based clients keep them in a file, some in the registry. Even if you had a means to generate lists for all your SSH clients in their various native formats, many of the actual client machines may be unreachable for updates  remote machines, laptops, etc. .  At all too many companies, the difficulty of managing SSH server keys leads to a very lax approach to server verification. Users frequently see warning messages about  452    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   missing or changed keys, and the IT staff tells them to “just accept the new key.” Very soon, these messages are completely ignored by everyone—or worse, just made to go away entirely! We’ve actually encountered an SSH installation with this config- uration:    etc ssh ssh_config GlobalKnownHostsFile    dev null UserKnownHostsFile      dev null StrictHostKeyChecking  no  Scary, but understandable; SSH had cried wolf one too many times. Unfortunately, effectively skipping server authentication disables a vital part of SSH security: resis- tance to server host spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks! This situation also makes it impractical to replace server keys periodically, as should be done, or to revoke a key in case it is known to be compromised  i.e., tell clients to no longer trust it .  All these remarks apply to the usual modes of SSH public-key user authentication, as well. Authorizing a user for login means modifying an authorization list on every host to which the user requires access, adding his key. Revoking that access means tracking all those files down—including files he may have modified himself, perhaps to allow access to accounts other than his own, that you know nothing about. Changing keys may be essentially impossible; after a while, the user himself may have no idea where that key has gotten to! Eventually, a compromised key is almost sure to work on some machine where it’s lying forgotten in a dusty authorized_keys file  or ~ .ssh2 authorization file, or registry key, or ... .  Now, none of these issues is new or unique to SSH. The problem of large-scale, cen- tralized authentication and authorization  AA  has been studied for a long time, and standard solutions exist. Fortunately, besides simplicity, another strength of SSH is flexibility. The common devices that we’re complaining about are not implied by the SSH protocol; they’re just widespread implementations. The protocol says nothing about how a server key should be verified or a user key authorized for access, and SSH software is free to use more sophisticated methods. Moreover, the protocol is extensible so that new elements such as key types or authentication exchanges can be defined as needed in order to support such methods.  Of course, flexibility doesn’t help much if there are no such “sophisticated meth- ods” actually available. For years, there weren’t—but recently, maturing SSH prod- ucts have incorporated support for scalable AA. We will discuss two here: X.509 public-key infrastructure  PKI  with Tectia, and Kerberos with OpenSSH.  A word before we start: both Kerberos and X.509 PKI are substantial topics on their own, and we can’t do more than scratch the surface of them here. We’ll give just a brief  incomplete!  sketch of each system, present a simple working configuration, and make some comments about other features to look at. Beyond that, you’ll need to read up on these systems yourself in order to delve into their use.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    453   11.5.1  Tectia with X.509 Certiﬁcates  11.5.1.1 What’s a PKI? “X.509 PKI”—a forbidding term; it sounds like part of a warp engine that needs cali- bration, right after you reinitialize the field coils. Let’s break it down: PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure, and refers to a system for dealing in scalable fashion with the trust issues raised by deploying asymmetric  public-key  cryptography, including:    Binding public keys to identities: users, hosts, routers, etc.—these are the princi-    Indicating or controlling the use of keys  encryption, signing, email, web SSL,  pals in the system  etc.     Replacing keys   Renewing or revoking previously made bindings   Securely communicating all these properties  Although the term sounds generic, in practice it has come to refer specifically to hier- archical systems in which so-called Certifying Authorities  CAs  vouch for the iden- tity of principals and certify ownership of cryptographic keys. CAs can themselves be vouched for by higher CAs, arranged in a tree of trust. This reduces the trust prob- lem to distributing the keys of a small number of well-known authorities, avoiding the combinatorial explosion of dealing individually with every pair of principals who might need to communicate securely.  X.509 is the name of a standards document of the International Telecommunica- tions Union  ITU, formerly the CCITT . Its original intent was to describe an authentication system for another ITU standard: X.500 directories  the title is “Rec- ommendation X.509: The Directory Authentication Framework” . However, in the process it specified a format for digital certificates: data structures which embody the key principal binding we mentioned, and that portion of X.509 has become widely used in PKI systems.  X.509-style PKIs also use a great many other standards. To get an idea of the scope of the subject, just take a look at the home page of the IETF PKIX working group, at:  http:  www.ietf.org html.charters pkix-charter.html  It’s a daunting list...but we’ll just sum up the essentials here. The most important components of a certificate are:    Issuer name   Subject name   Public key   Validity dates   Signature  454    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The signature is a cryptographic function of the entire certificate data structure, and is made by the issuer using its private key  which does not appear here . The mean- ing of the certificate is: “the issuer vouches that the subject owns the private counter- part to this public key  but this affidavit is only good between the given validity dates .”  Now in reality, certificates can be much more complex, containing many more attributes. Also, the interpretation may be different: “owns” might mean “is autho- rized to use,” or “has access to sign with but does not actually know,” etc. And there are many unanswered questions here, such as how carefully did the issuer check the subject’s identity? But we’ll leave all that alone and concentrate on the basics.  The issuer and subject name are expressed as Distinguished Names  DNs , as defined by X.509. These are attribute value sets, represented in text like this:   C=US ST=New York O=Mad Writer Enterprises CN=Richard E. Silverman  emailAddress=res@oreilly.com  The attribute abbreviations here are Country, STate, Organization, and Common Name  and there are more .  Now, let’s see how all this helps with SSH host key verification.  11.5.1.2 Using certiﬁcates with Tectia host keys When an SSH client connects to a server, it needs to verify that the server’s host key actually belongs to the host it intended to contact. The usual way is to compare it to a local list of already known keys, but that has many drawbacks, as we pointed out earlier. Instead of managing an unwieldy, changing set of host keys, with PKI each client needs only one public key: that of a CA shared by all hosts in the system. Each time you deploy a new Tectia host, you generate a new hostkey as usual—but you also obtain a certificate, binding the host’s name to its public key. That certificate is signed by the CA, and every client has the CA’s public key. During the key-exchange phase of the SSH protocol, the client receives the certificate along with the server’s hostkey; there are key types x509v3-sign-rsa and x509v3-sign-dss for this purpose instead of the usual ssh-rsa and ssh-dss. Instead of looking up the hostkey in a list, the Tectia client:  1. Compares the subject name in the certificate to the server hostname and verifies  that they match  2. Verifies the server’s signature on the key-exchange transaction, proving it actu-  ally holds the corresponding private key  3. Verifies the issuer signature on the certificate using the CA’s public key, to be  sure it’s genuine  i.e., that the certificate was actually issued by the trusted CA   If the key passes all these tests, then the client considers the key valid, and server authentication succeeds. You’ll notice this doesn’t completely remove the need for key distribution: the clients do still need to get the CA key in a trusted manner. But  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    455   it’s much easier to distribute or update a single key that changes very infrequently, than to manage a constantly changing known-hosts list!  Now we’ll get down to specifics with a simple example.  11.5.1.3 A simple conﬁguration For our example, we’ll start with a new instance of Tectia Server installed on a Linux host; first, we need to generate a hostkey with a certificate. This is not something we can describe very comprehensively, because it relies on outside factors: what actual PKI system is in use. You might be using anything from a home-brew CA using the free OpenSSL software that comes with most Unix variants these days, to a managed PKI service outsourced to a major security vendor, involving multiple layers of hier- archy, cross-certification among organizations, separate Registration Authorities, private-key escrow, etc.  If the PKI in question uses the Certificate Management Protocols  CMP, RFC-2510 , then you can use ssh-cmpclient to communicate with the PKI system: generate keys; request, receive, revoke, or update certificates; etc. You should consult your PKI ven- dor or managing staff as to how to proceed in this case. To keep our example sim- ple, we’ll follow an older but still widely used process: generating a keypair and certificate request using OpenSSL, which we then supply to the CA by some simple method  email and the Web are the usual ways .  11.5.1.4 Getting a certiﬁcate Suppose our company is Vogon Construction, Inc., and the server hostname is jeltz. vcon.com. To generate a key pair and certificate request:  % openssl req -nodes -config -new rsa:1024 -out request.pem \   -outform pem -keyout private.pem -days 1095 \   -subj ' C=US ST=New York L=Manhattan O=Vogon Construction, Inc. CN=jeltz.vcon.com'  This generates a new 1024-bit RSA key pair and produces two files:  private.pem  request.pem  The unencrypted private key  An X.509 certificate request  The request.pem file contains the public key and asks to bind the hostname jeltz. vcon.com to that key for a period of three years  1095 days . The DN contains other information besides the hostname, and typically the CA will require set values for some of that, e.g., that the Organization field match that of the CA.  Next, send the request to the CA, and engage in whatever authentication procedures it requires: call Bob in IT, verify receipt of an email at your given address, swear an oath and sign in blood—whatever it takes. When the CA is satisfied, it will return to  456    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

If it is an ASCII file looking like this:  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIDbzCCAtigAwIBAgIDA9GvMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBQUAME4xCzAJBgNVBAYTAlVT MRAwDgYDVQQKEwdFcXVpZmF4MS0wKwYDVQQLEyRFcXVpZmF4IFNlY3VyZSBDZXJ0 ... VdrJ1Z4HLT7PL+nEuvRJcpyw+A== -----END CERTIFICATE-----  then it is in a format called PEM; if it’s not, then it’s in another format called DER.  The two files, private.pem and certificate.blob, contain the host private key and our desired certificate; you can delete request.pem. Now, we need to convert these to Tectia’s format for host keys, in a two-step process. First:  % openssl pkcs12 -export -out jeltz.p12 -in certificate.blob -inform {pemder} -inkey private.pem  Choose “pem” or “der” depending on the format of the certificate. This stores the combined public key, private key, and certificate in a single file using yet another for- mat, PKCS-12. You will be prompted for a passphrase to protect the file. This is a good format in which to store the keypair and certificate in case you need to rebuild the host and restore the key, so keep that file. Next:  $ ssh-keygen -k jeltz.p12 -p ''  This will, of course, prompt you for the passphrase  twice, in fact , and finally pro- duce the two files we want:  jeltz.p12-1_ssh2.crt  Certificate in DER format  jeltz.p12_ssh2  Unencrypted private key in SECSH format used by Tectia [6.1.2]  Now, to get Tectia sshd to use them.  11.5.1.5 Hostkey veriﬁcation: conﬁguring the server Install the new key and certificate in the Tectia configuration directory:   install -o root -m 444 jeltz.p12-1_ssh2.crt  etc ssh2 jeltz.crt  install -o root -m 444 jeltz.p12_ssh2  etc ssh2 jeltz  and add this to sshd2_config:  HostCertificateFile jeltz.crt HostKeyFile jeltz  PublicHostKeyFile hostkey.pub HostKeyFile hostkey  If you want to continue offering the existing plain ssh-dss host key as well as the new certificate, you may need to add or uncomment the following:  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    457   These are the defaults if no hostkey is specified, but once you add the HostCertificateFile, the defaults will not apply. For our example, though, we sug- gest you turn or leave off all other hostkeys so that successful server authentication by the client depends on this one key working.  Lastly, restart Tectia Server:   service sshd2 restart  and try to connect with ssh:  % ssh jeltz.vcon.com warning: Received host certificate is not valid, error: search-state = { certificate-was-not-found database-method-search-failed } warning: Authentication failed.  Disconnected  local ; key exchange or algorithm negotiation failed  Key exchange failed. .  This error message shows that we succeeded: the client received a certificate along with the host key. A debug trace will show more specifically that the host-key type has changed:  % ssh -d4 jeltz.vcon.com ... debug: Ssh2Client sshclient.c:244 ssh_client_key_check: Got key of type x509v3-sign- rsa debug: Ssh2Client sshclient.c:286 ssh_client_key_check: Checking certificate validity ...  Now, we just need to arrange for the client to be able to verify the certificate.  11.5.1.6 Hostkey veriﬁcation: conﬁguring the Client For this, we need the CA’s public key, itself in the form of a certificate. This should be readily available from your CA; after all, the CA isn’t much use unless everyone has it. Get it in DER format; if they provide it in PEM, convert it thus:  $ openssl x509 -inform pem -outform der -in   -out cacert.der  Now install the CA certificate:   install -o root -m 444 cacert.der  etc ssh2  configure ssh to use it:    etc ssh2 ssh2_config  Note that this path must be absolute, unlike in the server config, since otherwise it is relative  to the user's ~ .ssh2 directory. HostCANoCRLs  etc ssh2 cacert.der  ...and try!   Tectia $ ssh -v jeltz.vcon.com ...  458    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   debug: Ssh2Client sshclient.c:984 keycheck_cert_cb: Host certificate valid and signed by a trusted CA, accepting ...  If all has gone according to plan, this works, using whatever user authentication method you have available; the debug message shown indicates that the certificate validation succeeded.  11.5.1.7 User authentication: conﬁguring the client We have just set up server authentication using a server-supplied certificate. In fact, the converse is possible as well: Tectia Server can authenticate users by certificate as well. As before, we need a new keypair and certificate, this time for a DN matching a user. We follow the same procedure we used earlier [11.5.1.4], but with the follow- ing subject name:   C=US ST=New York L=Manhattan O=Vogon Construction, Inc. CN=Prostetnic V. Jeltz  subjectAltName=email:pvj@vcon.com  It is critical to include a subjectAltName of type email as shown—even if the user has no email address at all, in fact, and you have to make one up. It is a very confusing and thoroughly undocumented fact that Tectia Server requires the presence of this attribute for user certifi- cates, even if it’s not used. Otherwise, Tectia mysteriously rejects the certificate with no reason. It cost us several hours of bewilderment, culminating in an intense threesome with gdb and the Tectia source, to uncover this fact. In a related bit of confusion, there’s a bug in OpenSSL whereby this attribute will not be automatically copied into the certificate request, like everything else next to it. You must edit the OpenSSL configura- tion file  often in  usr share ssl openssl.cnf , and add or uncomment the following:  [ usr_cert ]  Once you have your private key and user certificate, place them in ~ .ssh2, say:  ~ .ssh2 pvj.crt Certificate  ~ .ssh2 pvj  Private key  and configure ssh to use this key:   ~ .ssh2 identification CertKey pvj  We know it won’t work, since we haven’t configured the server yet—but as a test:  % ssh -l pvj jeltz -o AllowedAuthentications=publickey warning: Authentication failed. Disconnected  local ; no more authentication methods available  No further authentication methods available. .  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    459   We set ssh to try only public-key authentication since that’s what we want to test; this way it doesn’t end up asking for a password. The interesting message will be in the server log, typically  var log secure:  sshd2: Authorization check for user pvj's certificate rejected, reason: No certificate authorization configured.  And now finally, we tell the server how to authorize users based on their certificates.  11.5.1.8 User authentication: conﬁguring the server With the old method, there was an implicit correspondence between an account and a public key authorized to log into it: the key sat in a special file in the account’s home directory. With PKI, there is only the certificate, so we need a rule whereby Tectia can determine whether a particular certificate grants access to the requested account. In fact, Tectia allows great flexibility in expressing such rules. First, add this to the server configuration:    etc ssh2 sshd2_config PKI cacert.der PKIDisableCrls yes MapFile cert.users  This tells Tectia Server to trust user certificates signed by our CA, and to use the rules in  etc ssh2 cert.users to authorize access to accounts. The rule language is described in the manpage for ssh_certd_config, section “MAPPING FILES.” We’ll give a few examples here:   allow a certificate issued to Prostetnic V.

So:   service ssh-certd restart  Now, try logging in again:  % ssh -l pvj jeltz -o AllowedAuthentications=publickey  If all has gone well, it will work, with the following telltale message in syslog:  sshd2: Certificate authentication for user pvj accepted.  You can have multiple PKI blocks in the server configuration, directing trust of vari- ous CAs and each with its own account mapping.  We have presented the simplest possible view of PKI; it may be much more compli- cated. You might interact with something called a Registration Authority for obtain- ing your certificate, for example, rather than directly with the CA. Verifying a certificate might involve following a chain of certificates and signatures back to a trusted “root” certificate, rather than just one—or there might be multiple trust paths, if cross-certification is available, etc.  11.5.2 OpenSSH and Tectia with Kerberos Kerberos is an authentication system that addresses the same set of problems as PKI: providing a scalable system for mutual authentication and secure communication. Kerberos simply uses a different basic model and set of technologies. It was origi- nally developed as part of Project Athena, a wide-ranging research and development effort carried out at MIT between 1983 and 1991, funded primarily by IBM and Digi- tal Equipment Corporation. Project Athena contributed many other pieces of tech- nology to the computing world, including the well-known X Window System. There is now an IETF Kerberos working group:  http:  www.ietf.org html.charters krb-wg-charter.html  which coordinates work on and standardization of the current version of the Ker- beros protocol, Kerberos-5.  There are two main distinctions between Kerberos and PKI:    Kerberos is based on symmetric encryption rather than public-key techniques.   Kerberos is an active third-party system.  Both the Kerberos and PKI models have trusted third parties: in PKI it is the CA, and in Kerberos it is a service called the Key Distribution Center  KDC . Both are trusted in the sense that principals depend on them to correctly identify other users, and not to reveal certain cryptographic secrets. However, Kerberos requires the real-time, online participation of the KDC when two principals wish to communicate. This is in contrast to PKI: once two principals have obtained certificates from the CA, they may communicate at any time by speaking only to each other; the CA is not  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    461   involved. It may be necessary to contact the CA for related services, such as check- ing for certificate revocation or obtaining issuance policies—but it is not required for the basic mutual authentication procedure.  This added availability requirement would seem to be a liability over PKI—but as usual, it’s all about trade-offs. In exchange, Kerberos offers a much simpler adminis- tration and user experience, as well as some different security properties. For instance, with Kerberos, users’ long-term secrets are never stored outside the KDC, whereas in PKI each user has the secret component of his keypair, which must be stored and protected.  11.5.2.1 How Kerberos works Since it is based on symmetric cryptography, Kerberos is perforce a shared-secret sys- tem. The basic unit of Kerberos administration is called a realm, which consists of a set of principals and single KDC database they trust. When a principal joins a Ker- beros realm, it shares a secret key with the KDC; the KDC database essentially con- sists of a list of principals and their keys. For user principals, the key is derived from a password. Principals may also correspond to software services, such as an SSH server, IMAP server, etc.; their keys are randomly generated and stored in protected files where the services can access them. A principal name looks like 1 2 3 ...  n@REALM. There can be any  positive  number of initial parts as shown, but in practice there are usually either one or two. A plain-user principal name would be res@REALM. A user principal name for particular uses, such as a privileged administrative instance, might be res admin@REALM. And a principal representing a service—say, an IMAP server on host mail.foo.org—would have the name imap mail.foo.org@REALM.  When principal A wants to communicate with another—say, B—principal A first tells the KDC that it wants to talk to B. Principal A needs to do two things: prove its identity to B, and establish a shared secret with B for secure communication, called a session key. The KDC provides these things in a message called a ticket, which it sends back to A. The ticket is sealed with A’s secret key, known only to the KDC and A—hence A trusts that it is genuine, and it is protected from network snooping. Unsealing the ticket, A finds the needed session key—and yet another ticket! This one, however, is sealed with B’s secret key  known only to the KDC and B . A can’t read this at all, but that doesn’t matter; all A needs to do is send this ticket as-is to B. When B unseals its ticket, it finds A’s name and another copy of the session key. Just as before, since B’s ticket is sealed with B’s key, B trusts that the ticket is genuine. The meaning of each ticket is that the KDC has shared the session key with A and B. The two principals then execute a protocol which proves to each that the other does in fact hold that key—at which point, mutual authentication is accomplished. Fur- ther, the session key can be used for subsequent security functions, such as encrypt- ing a conversation between them.  462    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Now, this explanation is very basic.* It doesn’t exactly describe the Kerberos proto- col, but rather, a simpler one. However, it gives the essential flavor of how the third- party shared-secret model works. The real Kerberos-5 protocol can be viewed as an elaboration on this basic idea, to address various possible attacks and provide more features. We won’t get any more detailed than we already have, except to list a few of the real-life differences:    Our model requires the user to type his password for every Kerberos transac- tion. Real Kerberos instead involves first issuing to a user a special ticket, called a ticket-granting ticket  TGT . Subsequent tickets for other principals involve presenting the TGT back to the KDC, proving that the requestor has been recently authenticated. TGTs  and indeed all tickets  expire after a period of time, typically 10 hours. So, the user need only type his password infrequently, and it need not be locally stored. The TGT must be stored, but it is of limited value  and can’t be used to change the user’s password .    The ticket expiration feature involves timestamps, which in turn require that all principals have synchronized clocks. Some skew is allowed  typically up to five minutes , but Kerberos will not function properly if hosts’ clocks drift too far from one another.  11.5.2.2 Kerberos support in SSH Kerberos support for SSH is not defined directly; rather, there is a draft that extends SSH to use GSSAPI, as documented in “Generic Security Services Application Pro- gramming Interface  RFC-2743 .”  GSS is a sort of security meta-protocol, with a role and implementation structure similar to that of PAM or SASL. GSS allows two communicating peers to negotiate security parameters abstractly, in terms of types of protection and relative strength rather than particular protocols, ciphers, or algorithms. The GSS layers on either side will pick the strongest compatible mechanisms available to each which meet their cli- ents’ needs, without the higher-level software needing to bother with the details. Typical GSS implementations allow adding new mechanisms in the form of system dynamic libraries, which then automatically become available to GSS clients without recompilation.  In particular, there is a GSS mechanism supporting Kerberos-5, documented in “The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism  RFC 1964 .”  Of course, this is a bit convoluted; why not simply support Kerberos directly as its own SSH protocol extension? This was in fact done in SSH-1. The answer is that GSS is becoming a widely used standard. By defining a method for using GSS in SSH, implementers can take advantage of existing GSSAPI software libraries. And in doing  * And in fact, in some ways an outright lie.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    463   so, SSH can automatically use new GSS security mechanisms as they become avail- able, without further standards work. For example, Tectia Windows Server provides both Kerberos and NTLM user authentication via GSSAPI. The relevant SSH proto- col draft is “GSSAPI Authentication and Key Exchange for the Secure Shell Proto- col”  draft-ietf-secsh-gsskeyex .  Just a few years ago, this whole area was a work in progress, with only patches and experimental implementations. Now, however, it has solidified and is present in sev- eral mainstream SSH products and platforms, including OpenSSH, OS X, and Tectia on both Windows and Unix. This matches the widening adoption of Kerberos in general. And amazingly...for the most part, they all interoperate! It is now possible to have strong authentication and single-signon among various OS SSH combinations, using Kerberos. Note that while it has been possible for a while to get something similar using SSH public-key authentication with ssh-agent, Kerberos is a win for two different rea- sons. The issue of central management and scalability for larger organizations, we’ve already discussed. The other important point is that public-key authentication is SSH-specific. You go to all the trouble to teach people about generating keys, using agents, enabling agent forwarding, etc.; and after all that work, you get a solution that works only for SSH. Suppose you log into a domain account on a Windows machine, then SSH to another one. Public-key authentication may let you log in, but you’ll have to type your password again at some point to gain access to resources such as network shares—your Windows domain credentials did not follow you over SSH. With Kerberos, however, the same credentials which allowed login can also be forwarded to the remote host and used there for other purposes. And since Kerberos is a standard, the same can be true connecting from a Windows to a Unix host. This provides a much more pervasive and useful single-signon system.  11.5.2.3 Kerberos interoperability with OpenSSH and Tectia As an example, we will take a lone Debian GNU Linux box, attached to a network of Windows machines in an Active Directory domain named AD.ORG. The Linux box, lonely.ad.org, is running Debian-unstable and has the following packages installed; krb5-user, krb5-doc, and ssh-krb5  which as of this writing is based on OpenSSH 3.8.1 . The Windows machines are running the Tectia Windows Server, Version 4.2 or later. Suppose you have an account, “joe,” in the Windows domain, you’re logged into the Debian machine, and you want to connect to the Windows server, “winnie,” You simply type:  lonely% kinit -f joe@AD.ORG  Amazingly, this prompts for your Windows password, and  assuming you type it in correctly —it works! No errors, no complaints, no “DANGER! WARNING! WIN- DOWS INCOMPATIBILITY DETECTED!” Disbelievingly, you type:  lonely% klist Ticket cache: FILE: tmp krb5cc_11500  464    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

The Windows DNS servers for the domain will publish such records automatically. If you have an alternate or more complicated configuration—say, using non-Windows nameservers—then you may have to add these records yourself  or you could resort to local configuration; see the manpage for krb5.conf .  Trembling with technological anticipation, you forge onward:  lonely% ssh winnie The authenticity of host 'winnie  10.2.17.4 ' can't be established.

Remember that SSH server authentication happens first, before user authentication; this shows that we’re still using the usual SSH key-based server authentication  assuming you don’t already have winnie’s key in your known-hosts list .

For example, going the other way in this scenario  Windows to Linux  would mean joining the Debian box to the Windows Kerberos realm. You could do this using Resource Kit utilities to add its host principal, host lonely.ad.org@AD.ORG, to the domain controller; extract a Unix-compatible keytab file from it; and copy it to  etc krb5.keytab on the Linux machine. Or, you might solve the problem a different way by placing the non- Windows hosts in a separate realm, perhaps with Linux-based KDCs, and establish- ing inter-realm trust between them. These issues are more specific to Kerberos administration than to SSH proper, and are beyond our scope here.  Before leaving this case study, let’s discuss some final details of SSH configuration, server authentication, and network address translation  NAT .  SSH configuration. The Debian ssh-krb5 package is built with Kerberos authentication turned on by default; that’s not normally true. In other situations you would have to set some configuration options:   ~ .ssh config GSSAPIAuthentication       yes GSSAPIDelegateCredentials  yes  You might not want to delegate credentials automatically for all connections, though, just as you might not set X forwarding on by default: it could give access to an attacker if the remote host has been compromised.  466    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Server authentication. The secsh-keyex draft defines Kerberos server authentication as well, in the form of new SSH-TRANS key exchange methods using GSSAPI. This part of the draft is not as widely implemented as user authentication, however; for example, the Debian and OS X versions of OpenSSH support it, whereas the main OpenSSH and Tectia do not. Its use is controlled with the GSSAPIKeyExchange server keyword. To see that the client supports it, look in the –v trace for lines like this:  debug1: Mechanism encoded as toWM5Slw5Ew8Mqkay+al2g== debug1: Mechanism encoded as A vxljAEU54gt9a48EiANQ==  The “mechanisms” here are GSSAPI mechanisms, and these messages occur during the key-exchange phase.  Kerberos server authentication, when available, has several advantages:  It relieves you of managing known-hosts lists  The client doesn’t consult these files at all; instead, it relies on Kerberos to vali- date the server’s identity. In fact, depending on the server implementation, you may be able to dispense with even generating host keys at all; the draft defines a “null” host key type for just this situation, where none is required. Of course, this would keep non-Kerberized clients from connecting at all, so you might want to keep host keys anyway for compatibility’s sake.  It automatically deals with host aliases  With known-host lists, every possible name a host might be called must be listed with that host’s key in the file. Kerberos, though, uses the server’s canonical name from the DNS, obtained by mapping the given name to an address and then mapping that address back to a name. As long as you maintain your hosts’ canonical names properly and use them for corresponding Kerberos service prin- cipals, aliases will be handled automatically. Note that this does entail some security trade-off: an attacker who can subvert the DNS can cause an SSH client to authenticate the server against the wrong name. Of course, the server it contacts must still actually validate against Ker- beros with this name, so it can’t be just any machine—but it might have creden- tials from a host the attacker previously compromised. This level of risk may be acceptable, but should be considered. This isn’t really a Kerberos-specific prob- lem; the same feature could be used with hostkey authentication, with the same usability security trade-off.  It’s much faster  Since Kerberos uses symmetric cryptography, it is noticeably faster than public- key methods. If both server and user authentication happen via Kerberos, new SSH connections can be very fast. In fact, the Kerberos exchange that affects server authentication does client authentication as well, and some implementa- tions support a userauth method named external-keyx that takes advantage of this fact. external-keyx says to the server, “Look back at the key exchange— you’ll find it already authenticated me, so please let me in!”  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.5 Scalable Authentication for SSH    467   There are some limitations, though. One is name uniqueness: hosts must have unique names known beforehand in order to be joined to the Kerberos realm. This shows up most immediately with the “localhost” problem: ssh localhost doesn’t usu- ally work with Kerberos server authentication, even when it works for connecting to the same machine using its hostname. This is because the name “localhost” means a different host on every machine—so there can’t be an entry in the Kerberos database for “localhost,” because it can only have one key. You can make it work by arrang- ing  etc hosts files so that on each host, 127.0.0.1 maps back to that host’s canonical name—but the way that hosts files work, this means the name must also forward- map to the loopback address, not the host’s “real” address. This has some advan- tages, actually, but is likely to break some things also; it may not be worth it.  The problem can also show up with more complicated network situations such as proxies, tunnels, or clusters of machines with dynamically assigned and shared addresses—anything in which the simple server hostname address correspondence Kerberos needs is violated. Furthermore, it won’t work for batch jobs if those don’t also use Kerberos for authentication, which is often not the best choice. The bottom line is that while Kerberos server authentication can be useful, hostkey-based authen- tication usually needs to be available as well for exceptional situations.  Network address translation  NAT . Kerberos originally bound credentials to the address of the machine to which they were issued, to make attacks harder: if someone man- aged to steal a ticket, it would be harder to  mis use it. However, in today’s sad world of ubiquitous NAT, this can cause more trouble than it’s worth. Most recent Kerberos deployments have this address-matching feature turned off, but you may need to do it yourself if not, e.g., with a statement like:    etc krb5.conf [libdefaults] noaddresses = true  This actually controls whether clients include addresses in ticket requests, so when you change it you will need to run kinit again. Situations involving multiple credential- forwarding connections may have addresses creep back in anyway, due to forwarding code which requests them anyway even if the original ticket had none; again, most recent Kerberos code has eliminated this problem, but you may still see it.  11.6 Tectia Extensions to Server  Conﬁguration Files  In Chapter 5, we described the server configuration files in detail, including OpenSSH’s sshd_config and Tectia’s sshd2_config. Tectia provides several levels of configuration not found in OpenSSH, called metaconfiguration and subconfigura- tion, and also some unusual rules for quoted values. We now cover them in detail.  468    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   11.6.1 Metaconﬁguration Tectia recognizes specially structured comments at the beginning of configuration files. These lines determine the syntax rules for the rest of the file, and are therefore called metaconfiguration information.  Configuration files distributed with Tectia all start with lines of the form:   SSH CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT VERSION 1.1  REGEX-SYNTAX egrep  end of metaconfig   leave above lines intact!   The first line specifies the syntax version number, and defines the start of the meta- configuration information. Increasing syntax version numbers allow the syntax rules to be extended, possibly in incompatible ways. As long as older configuration files explicitly specify their syntax versions, they can still be correctly understood by newer versions of the Tectia server.  The default syntax version  used if there is no metaconfiguration information  is 1.0. This refers to the “traditional” syntax rules understood by Tectia versions before Version 3.0.0  when the metaconfiguration information syntax was introduced . The latest syntax version at press time is 1.1.  Syntax rules are further refined by lines that immediately follow the syntax version. These lines contain pairs of metaconfiguration parameter names and values, and look similar to the keyword lines in the rest of the configuration file, with two impor- tant differences:    The pairs occur within comment lines.   The metaconfiguration parameter names must always be uppercase.  Syntax Version 1.1 adds support for the REGEX-SYNTAX parameter, which determines how regular expressions are interpreted. The three standards are:  egrep  the default for syntax version 1.1  zsh_fileglob or traditional  the default for syntax version 1.0  ssh  These values are case-insensitive, unlike the parameter names. Full syntax rules are described in Appendix B.  Metaconfiguration information ends when an unrecognized comment line  or a stan- dard, uncommented keyword line  is encountered. It’s a good idea to mark the end with an ordinary comment line  like “end of metaconfig” as shown earlier  that does not look like a metaconfiguration parameter, to prevent possible misinterpretation of adjacent comment lines and to enhance readability. Use of  instead of  is just a stylistic convention to allow the metaconfiguration information to be more easily dis- tinguished from unrelated comments.  11.6 Tectia Extensions to Server Configuration Files    469  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Pitfalls with Tectia Metaconﬁguration  Since metaconfiguration information in Tectia is represented as structured comments, there is an unfortunate consequence: typos can cause the information to be ignored silently, because unrecognized lines are just ordinary comments. This can cause subtle  and dangerous  misinterpretation of the rest of the configuration file. We therefore recommend using the boilerplate metaconfiguration information in the sample configuration files from Tectia as a template. Edit carefully and sparingly, if you need to make changes  e.g., to use a different regex syntax . Resist the temptation to omit the metaconfiguration information, however, because explicitly specifying the syntax rules will protect you in the future if the default rules change. For troubleshooting, the sshd -d command-line option [5.9] with the SshConfigParse module and a relatively high debug level can be informative:   Tectia sshd -d SshConfigParse=9  More precise rules for recognizing metaconfiguration information are:    Metaconfiguration information must be at the beginning of the configuration file. It can only be preceded by empty lines or whitespace, but not by ordinary comments or uncommented keyword lines.    Metaconfiguration information lines can only be separated by empty lines or whitespace. Don’t try to add ordinary comments  or standard keywords  within the metaconfiguration information.    The syntax version line must match the  egrep  regular expression:  .*VERSION[[:space:]]+[[:digit:]]+\.[[:digit:]]+.*  Note that VERSION must be uppercase, but can be preceded by any other charac- ters, which are ignored. At least one space must separate VERSION from the ver- sion number, which must have two numeric components, separated by a period. Any trailing characters are ignored. Here’s a valid example:  VERSION 1.1 -- Tectia Configuration File for server.example.com    Metaconfiguration parameter lines must match the  egrep  regular expression:  [[:space:]]+[[:upper:][:digit:]-]+\s+.*  Note that at least one space or extra  character must appear between the first  comment character and the parameter name  in contrast to the VERSION line , so a line like REGEX egrep does not work. Parameter names can contain only uppercase letters, digits, or hyphens. At least one space must separate the parameter name from the value. Values can contain whitespace.    Unrecognized parameter names are ignored, but metaconfiguration information  continues as long as the parameter line is well formed.  470    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Subconﬁguration Files  11.6.2 It is sometimes useful to customize the SSH server configuration depending on the type of connection or session. For example, a system administrator might want to impose stronger authentication requirements if a connection originates from a client outside of a firewall, or to record more detailed logging information about the activi- ties of special-purpose guest accounts.  Tectia servers support these kinds of conditional configuration modifications with host- and user-specific configuration files, which are known collectively as subconfig- uration files. The subconfiguration files use the same syntax as the main configura- tion file, except as noted later. Each file starts with its own, independent metaconfiguration information.  The HostSpecificConfig keyword is used to update the configuration based on the client host:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax HostSpecificConfig *.example.com     etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts   Tectia with egrep regex syntax HostSpecificConfig .*\.example\.com  etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts  The first value is a pattern that matches hostnames or addresses, as described for the AllowHosts keyword. [5.5.3] For example, if all of the machines inside a firewall are assigned to a range of addresses, it might be convenient to use a netmask for the pattern:   Tectia HostSpecificConfig \m10.1.1.0 24  etc ssh2 subconfig insiders  The second value is the filename containing the host-specific configuration.  the UserSpecificConfig keyword specifies a pattern describing user Similarly, accounts, and the filename with user-specific configuration settings that apply to those accounts. In the simplest case, the pattern matches usernames or numerical user IDs, as for the AllowUsers keyword: [5.5.1]   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax UserSpecificConfig guest[[:digit:]]  etc ssh2 subconfig guests   Tectia with egrep regex syntax UserSpecificConfig guest[[:digit:]]+   etc ssh2 subconfig guests   Tectia UserSpecificConfig 12[3-6][[:digit:]]  etc ssh2 subconfig guests  More generally, patterns have the form user[%group][@host].

If the pattern has two or more compo- nents  user, group, or host , then all of them must match for the user-specific config- uration to be read.  The Tectia server starts by reading the main configuration file, and sets up the default configuration, which can include references to the subconfiguration files, and an associated pattern for each. When a connection is accepted from a client host, the server forks, and the child process that handles the session inherits its own private copy of the configuration. This private configuration is discarded when the child pro- cess exits at the end of the session, so the private configuration can be modified with- out affecting the default configuration that is used as the starting point for other sessions.*  The metaconfiguration parameters are not considered part of the con- figuration and are not inherited by subconfiguration files. Metaconfig- uration information is independently associated with each file, because it describes the syntax of that file’s contents. Although it’s possible to use different metaconfiguration parameters for subconfigu- ration files, this is confusing, and we strongly recommend starting each subconfiguration file with the same, explicit metaconfiguration information as the main configuration file.  Immediately after the server accepts a new connection, but before any conversation ensues with the client, the server uses the client hostname or address to check the patterns for all HostSpecificConfig keywords, in the order that they were specified in the main configuration file. The server reads each host-specific configuration file for patterns that match, and modifies its private configuration as it does so.  * If debugging options [5.9] prevent forking, then the single server process exits after handling a single session,  so only a single copy of the configuration is needed.  472    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Later, when the username has been specified by the client  and group memberships have been determined by the server for the user , the server checks the patterns for all UserSpecificConfig keywords, again in the order indicated by the main configura- tion file, and reads user-specific configuration files for matching patterns to further customize the configuration.  The order for reading the configuration files is important because it determines how keywords apply to the final configuration that is used for each session. Keywords that are read later either override or append to the values for earlier keywords—this principle applies whether the keywords appear multiple times in a single file, or in separate files.  For example, suppose our main configuration file contains:*   Tectia:  etc ssh2 sshd2_config PasswordGuesses 1  UserSpecificConfig guest[[:digit:]]+      etc ssh2 subconfig guests UserSpecificConfig        .*%[x-z]guests  etc ssh2 subconfig xyz-guests  HostSpecificConfig      .*\.example\.com  etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts HostSpecificConfig .*\.foo\.example\.com  etc ssh2 subconfig foohosts  PasswordGuesses 2  When the server starts, it reads this main configuration file, and sets the value for the PasswordGuesses keyword first to 1, and then to 2. The server also records the file- names and patterns for the subconfiguration files.  Later, the server checks the patterns for the host-specific configuration files, in order. If a connection is accepted from laptop.foo.example.com, then both host patterns match. So, if the files contain:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts PasswordGuesses 3   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig foohosts PasswordGuesses 4  then the value for the PasswordGuesses keyword is overridden to 3, and subsequently to 4.  Finally, the server checks the patterns for the user-specific configuration files, again in order. If the client specifies the username as guest33, and the server determines that this user belongs to the group yguests, then both user patterns match. So, if the files contain:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig guests  * We’ll use egrep regex syntax exclusively in this running example for simplicity, but of course other regex syn-  taxes could be used as well.  11.6 Tectia Extensions to Server Configuration Files    473  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   PasswordGuesses 5   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig xyz-guests PasswordGuesses 6  then the value for the PasswordGuesses keyword is overridden to 5, and eventually to 6, which is the value that is actually used for authentication.  The order for reading keywords is determined primarily by the order for reading files, and secondarily by the order of occurrence of the individual keywords within each file. In our example, even though the last PasswordGuesses keyword in the main con- figuration file appears after the subconfiguration keywords, the settings in the sub- configuration files still override the default configuration. Similarly, even though UserSpecificConfig keywords appear before HostSpecificConfig keywords in the main configuration file, the server always reads host-specific configuration files before user-specific configuration files.  It’s therefore a good idea to order the keywords in the main configuration file to reflect the order imposed by reading subconfiguration files, with default settings first, followed by HostSpecificConfig and UserSpecificConfig keywords at the end. Our example would be more clearly written as:*   Tectia:  etc ssh2 sshd2_config PasswordGuesses 2  HostSpecificConfig      .*\.example\.com  etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts HostSpecificConfig .*\.foo\.example\.com  etc ssh2 subconfig foohosts  UserSpecificConfig guest[[:digit:]]+      etc ssh2 subconfig guests UserSpecificConfig        .*%[x-z]guests  etc ssh2 subconfig xyz-guests  Because host- and user-specific configuration files are read in the order specified in the main configuration file, the patterns should be listed starting with general pat- terns first, followed by increasingly specific patterns.† Patterns can be carefully con- structed and ordered to encode arbitrarily complicated logic for customizing almost any aspect of the configuration based on the client host, users, or groups: a very powerful feature.  Subconfiguration files can be further divided into sections, which are marked by even more specific patterns, each followed by a colon, on separate lines.‡ The keywords in each section are used only if the pattern for the section matches. Sections end when a  * We have removed the first PasswordGuesses keyword, since it is always overridden by the second occurrence  anyway.  † The order for reading files can also be viewed as a consistent progression from general settings in the main  configuration file to increasingly specific settings for hosts and users in the subconfiguration files.  ‡ The Tectia documentation also refers to sections as configuration blocks, or stanzas. Subconfiguration sec- tions have the same structure as those used in client configuration files [7.1.2], except for the interpretation of the patterns.  474    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   new pattern line is encountered, or at the end of the subconfiguration file. The sec- tion patterns in host- and user-specific configuration files are interpreted in the same way as the patterns for the HostSpecificConfig and UserSpecificConfig keywords, in the main configuration file, respectively.  Any line that ends in a colon character  “:”  is considered to be a sec- tion pattern line.  Sections are a useful alternative to separate subconfiguration files. We might choose to combine the host-specific configuration files from our original example as:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig ourhosts PasswordGuesses 3  ... other general keywords for all hosts in example.com  .*\.foo\.example\.com:   PasswordGuesses 4    ... other more specific keywords for foo.example.com  .*\.bar\.example\.com:   PasswordGuesses 8    ... other more specific keywords for bar.example.com  .*\.baz\.example\.com:   PasswordGuesses 9    ... other more specific keywords for baz.example.com  This is especially convenient if there are many general keywords for the primary domain, but only a few, more specific keywords for each subdomain. It’s also handy if there are lots of subdomains, because we can add or remove subdomains without modifying the main configuration file.  Sections cannot be used in the main configuration file. This makes sense: it isn’t at all clear what would be used to match such patterns. The server warns if any section pattern lines are detected in configura- tion files where sections are inappropriate, like the main configuration file.  Sections for user-specific configuration files work similarly. We can override settings for specific users:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig guests PasswordGuesses 5  ... other general keywords for all guest usernames  guest[0-4][[:digit:]]*:   PasswordGuesses 10    ... other more specific keywords for guest usernames with [0-4] digits  guest[5-9][[:digit:]]*:  11.6 Tectia Extensions to Server Configuration Files    475  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     PasswordGuesses 12    ... other more specific keywords for guest usernames with [5-9] digits  or for specific groups:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 subconfig xyz-guests PasswordGuesses 6  ... other general keywords for all [x-z]guests groups  .*%xguests:   PasswordGuesses 15    ... other more specific keywords for the xguests group  .*%yguests:   PasswordGuesses 16    ... other more specific keywords for the yguests group  .*%zguests:   PasswordGuesses 17    ... other more specific keywords for the zguests group  Several other important aspects of server behavior follow directly as consequences of the order and timing for reading the configuration files. The server normally reads its main configuration file only when it starts, and must be signaled to reread the config- uration later, if changes are made. [5.2.4] In contrast, subconfiguration files are reread for each connection, so no signaling is necessary if the files are modified. In fact, a “match anything” pattern can be used to store frequently changed keywords in a subconfiguration file, to avoid the need for frequent signaling:   Tectia with zsh_fileglob or traditional regex syntax HostSpecificConfig  *  etc ssh2 subconfig volatile   Tectia with egrep regex syntax HostSpecificConfig .*  etc ssh2 subconfig volatile  If an error is detected while reading the main configuration file, then the server exits. Errors within host-specific configuration files cause the connection to be terminated. For user-specific configuration files, errors result in denial of access.  Some keywords cannot be specified in subconfiguration files. In some cases, the key- words control server behavior that happens before the subconfiguration files are read. For example, it doesn’t make sense to specify the Port keyword [5.3.3.1] in subconfiguration files, because the port  or ports  must be chosen to listen for incoming connections before any connections can be accepted. Certain other key- words are forbidden in subconfiguration files because they would be too confusing. For example, the HostSpecificConfig and UserSpecificConfig keywords are restricted to main configuration files: imagine trying to understand the pretzel logic resulting from nested subconfiguration files! Tables 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3 list the key- words permitted in each kind of configuration file.  476    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

The following lines are all valid:*   Tectia PermitEmptyPasswords "no" PermitEmptyPasswords "y"es  In most cases, there is no reason to use quotes, but they are handy in a few, rare situ- ations. If a value ends with a colon  :  character, it will be misinterpreted as a sec- tion pattern: [5.2.1]   Tectia: misinterpreted as a section pattern!

Since the quoted line doesn’t end in a colon, it isn’t considered a section  * Single quotes have no special significance. † The server does warn about section patterns in configuration files that should not have them, like the main  configuration file, which makes the error easier to detect.  478    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Equivalently, you can also enclose only part of the value in quotes, as long as the quoted part includes the final colon:   Tectia AuthKbdInt.Plugin   usr local sbin kiplugin --prompt "color:" AuthKbdInt.Plugin   usr local sbin kiplugin --prompt  color":"  To include a literal quote character in a value, precede it with a backslash. For exam- ple, to construct a shell command that uses  shell  quotes to protect a command-line argument with embedded whitespace from being split:   Tectia AuthKbdInt.Plugin  usr local sbin kiplugin --prompt \"Enter your favorite color:\"  When configuration files are read, the whitespace between the keyword and value is discarded, and any trailing whitespace at the end of each line is removed from the value.* Quotes can be used to retain this whitespace as part of the value. As a devi- ous example, you can hide user configurations in a temporary directory named as a single space character:   Tectia UserConfigDirectory  tmp " "  11.7 Tectia Plugins The Tectia server can use external programs, known as plugins, for flexible handling of tasks like changing passwords [5.4.2.3], driving the process for keyboard- interactive authentication [5.4.5.2], or performing arbitrary checks for access con- trol. [5.5.6] We’ll demonstrate how to use plugins with several examples:    Handling expired passwords   Extending keyboard-interactive authentication   Authorization  11.7.1 A Plugin for Changing Expired Passwords Remember our discussion of expired passwords in Chapter 5? [5.4.2.3] We showed how Tectia’s SSH server can detect an expired password at authentication time, and prompt the user to change it:  $ ssh server.example.com rebecca's password:   Authentication successful.   Changing password for user rebecca.  * Keywords that use multiple values separated by whitespace also discard the whitespace between those val-  ues. Otherwise, whitespace that is embedded within a single value is left unchanged.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    479   Changing password for rebecca  current  UNIX password:   New password:   Retype new password:   passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. Connection to server.example.com closed.  The SSH server accomplishes this by calling either the system password-change pro- gram  e.g., passwd  or an alternative program specified by the PasswdPath configura- tion keyword. This technique, which is the default, uses a forced command to change the password. This method is conceptually simple but has several drawbacks:    No explicit indication is given that the password is expired, or that a forced com- mand is being used. Of course, the prompts from the password-change program are a clue, but a user might be  understandably!  suspicious about prompts that demand passwords for no apparent reason. Furthermore, if the user intends to run some other command with similar prompts for unrelated passwords, she might be confused by unexpected interactions with the password-change program.    While it makes sense to ask the user to type his new password twice, to avoid mistakes, it’s annoying and unnecessary to require entering the old password twice. This happens because the first old password is sent to the SSH server while the second is demanded by the password-change program, and the server doesn’t forward the password.    The connection is closed after the forced command finishes, whether the pass- word change was successful or not, and the user must then repeat the authenti- cation with a separate ssh command, which in turn requires entering the new password yet again.    The username isn’t passed from the SSH server to the password-change pro- gram, since most programs only allow non-root users to change their own pass- words, and some allow only root to specify a username on the command line. If several usernames use the same numerical user ID  a bad practice, but it does occur , then only the first user’s password is changed.  Fortunately, the SSH-2 protocol provides a better mechanism for changing pass- words during authentication, and Tectia allows a separate program, known as a pass- word-change plugin, to manage the process. This mode of operation is enabled by the AuthPassword.ChangePlugin keyword:   Tectia AuthPassword.ChangePlugin  usr local libexec ssh-passwd-plugin  Here’s an example of a password change using the plugin:  $ ssh server.example.com rebecca's password:   Your password has expired. New password:    480    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Enter password again:   Authentication successful.    As before, the client collects the user’s password and sends it to the server, which verifies it. When the server discovers that the password is expired, it sends an expira- tion message back to the client, which informs the user about what’s happening. The client then prompts for the new password and sends it to the server, which passes all of the necessary information  the username, plus the old and new passwords  to the plugin program to change the password. If the plugin tells the server that the change was successful, then the server considers authentication complete, and continues. Otherwise  if the change failed , the server tells the client, which can prompt the user to try again, without starting a new session or using a separate ssh command. Much better!  The plugin program runs with the privileges of the user, not those of the server. If the plugin program isn’t found or can’t be run for some other reason, then password changes always fail.  11.7.1.1 The ssh-passwd-plugin program Tectia includes a generic plugin program, ssh-passwd-plugin, in most binary distribu- tions.* ssh-passwd-plugin runs the system’s password-change program within a pseudo-terminal, effectively acting as an intermediary between the SSH server and the program that actually performs the password change, as shown in Figure 11-14.  SSH Client  SSH Server  SSH Password-Change Plugin   ssh-passwd-plugin   Password-Change Program   passwd   Figure 11-14. Tectia password-change plugin  The actions of ssh-passwd-plugin are controlled by the configuration file  etc ssh2  plugin passwd_config, which uses the same syntax as other server configuration files.† [5.2.1] The configuration file is read every time the plugin runs.  * Alternatively, the ssh-passwd-plugin program can be built from the source distribution. † Including metaconfiguration information.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    481   The ssh-passwd-plugin configuration consists of a series of Request and Response  or FinalResponse  keywords, which should occur in pairs:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config with egrep regex syntax Request "\ current\  UNIX password:" Response $old_password$\n  Request "New password:" Response $new_password$\n  Request "Retype new password:" FinalResponse $new_password$\n  This example describes the behavior of the password-change program used for the preceding forced-command example.  Request values are regular expressions that match output from the password-change program.  Quotes are required if the Request pattern ends with a colon  :  char- acter, to prevent misinterpretation as a section pattern line [5.2.1], or if the pattern ends in whitespace, which is normally discarded. It’s a good idea always to quote Request values.  Response values are strings that are sent to the password-change program when the preceding Request value matches. These strings can contain the following special tokens:    $user_name$   $old_password$   $new_password$  which are replaced by the values supplied by the client and forwarded via the server. Use $$ in the string to send a single $ character, or \n to send a newline.*  The last expected response is indicated by the FinalResponse keyword; its value uses the same format as Response.  Response strings can also be one of the following special result values:  $ERROR_DISPLAY  $ERROR_LOG  Send the match for the preceding Request value back to the client via the server and terminate, indicating that the password change failed.  The same, but only send the match to the server for logging, not to the client.  * Newlines are not supplied automatically, so most response strings will need at least one explicit \n, usually  at the end.  482    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   $SUCCESS  Indicate that the password change was completed successfully whenever the pre- ceding Request value matches.  The special result values for the response strings have a $ character at the beginning only, not at the end, unlike the tokens for the username and passwords. The result values are case-insensitive, but it’s best to use uppercase to distinguish them from the tokens, which must be lowercase.  Unrecognized output from the password-change program is ignored, so expected error messages should be matched and sent to the user:  If error messages contain sensitive information, or aren’t interesting for users, then they can be logged instead:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config Request "BAD PASSWORD: it's WAY too short" Response $ERROR_DISPLAY   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config Request "internal error: database corruption" Response $ERROR_LOG  Similarly, if the password-change program prints a success message, ssh-passwd- plugin can use it to determine that the operation went well:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config Request "all authentication tokens updated successfully" Response $SUCCESS  Some password-change programs succeed silently, however. In this case, ssh-passwd- plugin can examine the exit status returned by the password-change program to detect success, using the GetSuccessFromExit keyword:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config GetSuccessFromExit yes  A zero exit status indicates success. The default value for GetSuccessFromExit is no, meaning that the exit status is ignored. Unless you are using a broken program that returns random exit status values, we recommend configuring ssh-passwd-plugin to enable GetSuccessFromExit.  By default, ssh-passwd-plugin waits up to four seconds for output from the password- change program. This can be changed using the DataTimeout keyword:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config DataTimeout 10  The value is a number of seconds; time units are not recognized.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    483   An alternate password-change program can be specified using the PasswdPath keyword:   Tectia:  etc ssh2 plugin passwd_config PasswdPath  usr local bin goodpasswd $user_name$  This differs from the PasswdPath keyword in the server configuration file in that ssh- passwd-plugin expands tokens, as shown for the username.  The server is supposed to supply the value for its PasswdPath keyword to the plugin as a default; the PasswdPath keyword in ssh-passwd- plugin’s own configuration file would then override the server’s value. However, this isn’t actually done  as of Tectia Version 4.1 , so it’s nec- essary for ssh-passwd-plugin to always specify the PasswdPath if the value needs to be changed.  Debugging the interactions between ssh-passwd-plugin and the password-change program can be challenging. Because unrecognized output is simply discarded, the usual symptom of mismatches in the configuration file is the error:  Timeout when waiting for exit status.  ssh-passwd-plugin recognizes the –d or --debug command-line options, but these are not passed automatically from the sshd command line to the ssh-passwd-plugin com- mand line, so it’s necessary to specify the option in the value for the AuthPassword. ChangePlugin keyword. Use the GenPasswdPlugin module and a high debug level to see all of the data exchanged between the programs:   Tectia AuthPassword.ChangePlugin  usr local libexec ssh-passwd-plugin -d GenPasswdPlugin=9 2>>  tmp plugin.dbg  Alternately, ssh-passwd-plugin uses the value of the environment variable SSH_DEBUG_ LEVEL, which can be set before starting the server. If both the environment variable and the command-line option are used, the option wins.  Debug output is written to the standard error stream, but the server runs the plugin using the  Bourne  shell, so we append the output to a file with the 2>> redirection. This is needed when the SSH server runs in the background as a daemon, because stderr is discarded. If the server is also running in debug mode, so stderr is already being sent to some convenient location, then the 2>> redirection can be omitted, and ssh-passwd-plugin will send its debug output to the same place as the server.  11.7.1.2 A Perl package implementing the Tectia plugin protocol All Tectia plugins use a simple, line-oriented protocol designed to facilitate script- ing. Here we discuss some of the common elements of the protocol, and illustrate them by writing a Perl package, Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin, containing handy func- tions that we’ll use in our example plugin scripts. We chose the Net::SSH prefix to correspond with other Perl packages for SSH available on CPAN.  484    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   General Rules for Plugins  When working with plugins, be aware of the following important points: Use absolute pathnames to specify plugins  This is true even though some Tectia sample configuration files suggest using only command names as values for plugin keywords. The server intends to search the libexec and bin subdirectories of the Tectia install directory for plugin programs. However, bugs prevent this feature from working  as of Tectia Version 4.1 , so only the PATH inherited by the SSH server is actually used.  Command-line arguments are supported  Use quotes carefully in the values for plugin keywords if the command-line argu- ments include whitespace or colons. [11.6.3]  Know your stdin, stdout, and stderr  The server runs a plugin program with pipes connected to the plugin’s standard input and output streams for communication with the server. The standard error stream is discarded by both the server and the plugin, and should therefore be avoided.  As we discuss each type of plugin, we’ll provide examples written in Perl, but any language can be used; in fact, the Tectia source distribution includes some sample plugins written as Bourne shell scripts.  The package starts with the usual preliminaries, exported functions, and a version number for the package:  identifying the names of the  package Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin; use strict; BEGIN {     use Exporter;     use vars qw @ISA @EXPORT $VERSION ;     @ISA = qw Exporter ;     @EXPORT = qw          &ssh_plugin_recv         &ssh_plugin_params         &ssh_plugin_send         &ssh_plugin_success         &ssh_plugin_failure      ;     $VERSION = 1.01; }  1;   return true for import  The server sends lists of  key,value  pairs to the plugin, which reads them on its stan- dard input. Each pair is formatted as “key:value” on a separate line, and the end of the list is marked by a line of the form “end_of_words” where “words” describes the kind of information in the list.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    485   Keys and the end marker are case-insensitive. The plugin is supposed to ignore keys that it does not understand, to allow for future extensions to the protocol. If the end marker is not seen, the plugin must fail, as described shortly.  The ssh_plugin_recv function conveniently reads information lists from the server:   Read a list of "key:value\n" pairs from the server.  Usage: &ssh_plugin_recv $words , where "end_of_$words\n"  case-insensitive   marks the end of the list.  Returns  "end_of_$words", key1, value1, key2, value2, ...  on success,  or an empty list on failure. sub ssh_plugin_recv {     my $words = shift;     my @pairs;   accumulated list of  key, value  pairs       read each line from the server     while     {         chomp;   discard newlines          return the end marker and list of pairs if the end marker is seen         return  $_, @pairs  if  ^end_of_$words$ i;   case-insensitive          my  $key, $value  = split ':', $_, 2 ;         $key = lc $key ;     keys are case-insensitive: translate to lowercase          push @pairs, $key, $value ;     }      return undef;    return an empty list if no end marker was seen }  All plugins start by reading a list of parameters from the server, so we provide a shorthand function for that:   Read a list of parameters from the server. sub ssh_plugin_params   { &ssh_plugin_recv "params" ; }  The plugin sends messages back to the server by writing single-word tokens or “key: value” pairs, each on a separate line, to the plugin’s standard output stream:   Send a message to the server.  Usage: &ssh_plugin_send $token  to send "$token\n"      or &ssh_plugin_send $key, $value  to send "$key:$value\n". sub ssh_plugin_send {     local $ = 1;    flush data to pipe after every write, to avoid buffering     print join ':', @_ , "\n"; }  Special messages are used to indicate success or failure of the operation performed by the plugin:   Send success or failure messages to the server. sub ssh_plugin_success  { &ssh_plugin_send "success" ; } sub ssh_plugin_failure  { &ssh_plugin_send "failure" ; }  486    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Nevertheless, it’s good form to return a zero or nonzero exit status value for success or failure, respectively.  11.7.1.3 Creating a customized password-change plugin Now that we’ve created the Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin package, let’s write our own password-change plugin script with it. This might be useful if passwords are stored in some kind of nonstandard external database, and are changed by a mechanism other than a traditional passwd program, so that ssh-passwd-plugin can’t be used.  The plugin starts by reading parameters from the server, which include the user- name as well as old and new passwords supplied by the client:  ! usr bin perl -w use strict; use Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin; my  $end, %params  = &ssh_plugin_params   ;  The keys and values for the parameters are stored in the %params hash for easy retrieval.  The plugin sends error messages back to the server using error_msg and error_log keys, which correspond to the $ERROR_DISPLAY and $ERROR_LOG special response val- ues used by ssh-passwd-plugin:  sub ssh_plugin_error_msg    { &ssh_plugin_send "error_msg", @_ ; } sub ssh_plugin_error_log    { &ssh_plugin_send "error_log", @_ ; }  It’s a good idea for the plugin to check for and log protocol violations:  sub ssh_plugin_die {     &ssh_plugin_error_log @_ ;     &ssh_plugin_failure   ;     exit 2 ; } &ssh_plugin_die "missing end marker for params"     unless defined $end ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing user_name"     unless exists $params{"user_name"} ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing old_password"  unless exists $params{"old_password"} ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing new_password"  unless exists $params{"new_password"} ;  Finally, the plugin changes the password, in our example using a change_password function that updates the database, and indicates the result of the operation to the server, which forwards it back to the client:  my $result = &change_password $params{"user_name"},                               $params{"old_password"},                               $params{"new_password"} ;  if  $result eq "success"  {     &ssh_plugin_success   ;     exit 0 ; } else {  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Example 11-1. Our password-change plugin  ! usr bin perl -w  use strict; use Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin;  my  $end, %params  = &ssh_plugin_params   ;  sub ssh_plugin_error_msg    { &ssh_plugin_send "error_msg", @_ ; } sub ssh_plugin_error_log    { &ssh_plugin_send "error_log", @_ ; }  sub ssh_plugin_die { &ssh_plugin_die "missing end marker for params"     unless defined $end ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing user_name"     unless exists $params{"user_name"} ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing old_password"  unless exists $params{"old_password"} ; &ssh_plugin_die "missing new_password"  unless exists $params{"new_password"} ;  my $result = &change_password $params{"user_name"},                               $params{"old_password"},                               $params{"new_password"} ;  if  $result eq "success"  {     &ssh_plugin_success   ;     exit 0 ; } else {     &ssh_plugin_error_msg $result ;      tell the client why it failed     &ssh_plugin_failure   ;     exit 1 ; }  The server is supposed to pass the value for its PasswdPath keyword to the plugin using the SSH2_PASSWD_PATH environment variable, which could be accessed as:  my $passwd = $ENV{"SSH2_PASSWD_PATH"};  However, the server doesn’t currently do this  as of Tectia Version 4.1 .  11.7.2 A Plugin for Keyboard-Interactive Authentication Keyboard-interactive authentication, including one-time passwords and challenge- response authentication, was covered in Chapter 5. [5.4.5] Here we’ll show how to construct a plugin with our Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin package to hook into  488    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   keyboard-interactive authentication. It will prompt the user for some personal infor- mation, which is recorded  perhaps at account creation time  in a database.*  The plugin starts by reading parameters from the server:  ! usr bin perl -w use strict; use Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin;  sub ssh_plugin_die {     &ssh_plugin_failure   ;     exit 2 ; }  user_name  host_ip  host_name  The local  server  host address.  The local  server  hostname.  remote_user_name  remote_host_ip  The remote  client  host address.  remote_host_name  The remote  client  hostname.  my  $end_params, %params  = &ssh_plugin_params   ; &ssh_plugin_die    unless defined $end_params ;  The plugin checks for protocol violations, such as a missing end marker for the parameters, and indicates failure using the ssh_plugin_die function.  The parameters are stored in the %params hash for easy retrieval. Keys supplied by the server include:  The username requested by the client  to be used on the server .  The remote  client  username. This is sent only if it is known by the server from an earlier hostbased authentication.  The RFC.kbdint_plugin_protocol file in the source distribution only defines the parameter’s user_name, remote_host_ip, and remote_host_ name. The Tectia plugin protocol requires plugins to ignore unrecog- nized parameters.  * See the file RFC.kbdint_plugin_protocol in the Tectia distribution for details, and kbdint_plugin_example.sh  for another example implemented as a shell script.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    489   The keyboard-interactive plugin next sends a list of prompts to be displayed by the client:  &ssh_plugin_send "instruction", "Please provide some personal information." ; &ssh_plugin_send "req",         "Favorite color: " ; &ssh_plugin_send "req",         "Pet's name: " ; &ssh_plugin_send "req_echo",    "Do you like chocolate? " ; &ssh_plugin_send "end_of_requests" ;  The optional “instruction” message is used to display introductory information.  Although the SSH-2 protocol  as described in the IETF SECSH draft  supports newlines in the instruction string, there is no way to send them using the Tectia plugin protocol, which uses newlines as delimit- ers. If multiple instruction strings are sent, only the last one is used by the server.  Responses collected by the client are not echoed for prompts specified by req mes- sages. If the response should be echoed, then the req_echo message can be used instead.  The list of prompts ends with the end_of_requests marker. When the server reads the marker, it sends the list of requests to the client.  After the client collects the replies and sends them back to the server, the server for- wards them to the plugin using the same kind of list:  my  $end_replies, @replies  = &ssh_plugin_recv "replies" ; &ssh_plugin_die    unless defined $end_replies ;  The replies are stored in the @replies list as a series of  key,value  pairs; each reply pair corresponds to a request prompt. We use a list rather than a hash because the server uses a reply message for each response value, but the plugin can step through the list to set up a %replies hash for easy retrieval, checking for and rejecting proto- col violations as it does so:  my %replies; foreach my $reply qw color petname chocolate  {     my  $key, $value  = splice @replies, 0, 2 ;     &ssh_plugin_die    unless defined $key  && $key eq "reply" &&                              defined $value ;     $replies{$reply} = $value; } &ssh_plugin_die    if @replies;   too many replies  Finally, the plugin uses any subset of the parameters and the replies collected from the user for authentication, in our example using a verify_personal_info function, and indicates the result of the operation to the server, which forwards it back to the client:  my $result = &verify_personal_info $params{"user_name"},                                     ... and other params, if relevant ...  490    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Favorite color: green   Pet's name: Elvis   Do you like chocolate? yes   Authentication successful.    Here’s an example of keyboard-interactive authentication in action, shown from the client’s perspective:  Of course, a GUI-based SSH client could display the information in a different format.  The plugin can perform additional rounds of request reply interactions if needed.  For example, if some of the responses were malformed, the plugin can ask again; in this case, an instruction message is often used to provide guidance about allowable values:  unless  $replies{"chocolate"} eq "yes"          $replies{"chocolate"} eq "no"  {     &ssh_plugin_send "instruction", "Please answer \"yes\" or \"no\"." ;     &ssh_plugin_send "req_echo",    "Do you like chocolate? " ;     &ssh_plugin_send "end_of_requests" ; }  Subsequent interactions are sometimes needed to collect follow-up information whose relevance is based on previous responses:  if  $replies{"chocolate"} eq "yes"  {     &ssh_plugin_send "instruction", "Tell us more about how you like chocolate!" ;     &ssh_plugin_send "req",         "Light or dark? " ;     &ssh_plugin_send "req",         "With nuts? " ;     &ssh_plugin_send "end_of_requests" ; }  More realistic examples of additional queries would be prompting to update expired passwords, multistage challenge-response protocols, etc.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    491   Only a single plugin can be specified by the AuthKbdInt.Plugin keyword. If multiple keyboard-interactive authentication techniques must be supported by the plugin, then it should ask the user to pick a technique during an initial round of interac- tions, and pose follow-up queries for specific techniques during subsequent rounds.  To use Tectia’s SecurID plugins along with other techniques that are supported by a custom plugin, the custom plugin can be written to forward information between the server and the SecurID plugins, according to the Tectia plugin protocol. An alternative is to recompile the server with built-in support for SecurID, eliminating the need for separate SecurID plugins.  The plugin should not implement its own retry logic for failed authentications. Instead, it should simply indicate failure and let the server manage retry attempts, according to the value for the AuthKbdInt.Retries keyword.  The plugin program must be written carefully, since it runs with all of the privileges of the SSH server  typically root . For example, it’s important to treat all data sup- plied by the user as potentially hostile: consider buffer overruns, special characters used to construct filenames, etc. Perl’s “taint mode” is useful for detecting possible security problems.  A more subtle danger is information leakage. For example, it might seem reasonable for a plugin to fail immediately after the initial parameters have been received from the server, if  say  the username is found to be invalid. After all, why ask for more information if the authentication will fail anyway? The problem with this approach is that it allows remote attackers to determine which usernames are valid, without authenticating. A system administrator might notice large numbers of failed authen- tications in the system logs [5.9], but by then, the damage has already been done. A better approach is to always collect all information from the user, and make authentication decisions only after this has been done. The design of the prompts can be tricky when later interactions depend on the validity of previous responses. In some cases, it’s necessary to use “fake” information so that all of the interactions will seem plausible when early replies are incorrect. Even timing can be a concern. If authentication is computationally expensive, or requires a measurable amount of time to complete for other reasons, it may be neces- sary for the plugin to sleep for an equivalent interval when those costly authentica- tion steps are skipped, so an attacker can’t tell what’s happening.  11.7.3 A Plugin for External Authorization Next we’ll write a plugin, once again using our Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin package, to perform external access control. Our plugin will allow guest accounts to log in  492    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   from untrusted systems, but only at certain times.* We covered external access con- trol in Chapter 5. [5.5.6]  The plugin starts by reading parameters from the server:  ! usr bin perl -w use strict; use Net::SSH::Tectia::Plugin;  my  $end, %params  = &ssh_plugin_params   ;  unless  defined $end   {     &ssh_plugin_failure   ;     exit 2 ; }  The plugin checks for protocol violations, such as a missing end marker for the parameters, and indicates failure  causing access to be denied  if any are detected.  The parameters are stored in the %params hash for easy retrieval. The server supplies the same keys as for keyboard-interactive plugins. [11.7.2]  The program then uses any of the parameters and other information at its disposal to determine if access should be allowed or denied:  my $restrict =     &account_type $params{"user_name"}  eq "guest" &&     &host_trust_level $params{"remote_host_ip"},                       $params{"remote_host_name"}  eq "outside" &&     &schedule time  eq "prime";  Our example uses an &account_type function to categorize usernames, perhaps based on the username itself  like AllowUsers or DenyUsers [5.5.1]  or by looking up group memberships  like AllowGroups or DenyGroups [5.5.2] . Similarly, an &host_trust_ level function classifies remote hosts, based on the address or hostname  like AllowHosts or DenyHosts [5.5.3] .  External authorization programs are especially useful when access control decisions must be based on complicated logic or information that is not understood directly by the Tectia server. For example, netgroups or other databases could be used by the &account_type or &host_trust_level functions to evaluate users or hosts, respec- tively, and other factors such as the time can be incorporated, in our example by a &schedule function.  Finally, the program indicates success or failure to the server to allow or deny access:  if  ! $restrict  {     &ssh_plugin_success   ;     exit 0 ; } else {  * See the file RFC.authorization_program_protocol.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  11.7 Tectia Plugins    493       &ssh_plugin_failure   ;     &ssh_plugin_send "error_code", "generic_error" ;     &ssh_plugin_send "error_msg",  "Remote guest logins are not allowed during prime time." ;     exit 1 ; }  The program can send an error code and message to the server to describe failures. The protocol defines only two error codes:  password_too_old  The user’s password has expired.  generic_error  Some other error occurred.  If the program informs the server about password expiration, then the server runs the system password-change program  either the default, or the value for the PasswdPath keyword  as a forced command. [8.2.3] It does not, however, run a password-change plugin, because the plugin applies only to the authentication phase, which has already been completed when the external authorization program runs.  In practice, password expiration isn’t very useful for external authori- zation programs, since the programs don’t interact  even indirectly  with clients, and passwords are really associated with separate authen- tication techniques that are performed earlier. Instead of using the password_too_old error code with an external authorization program, use a keyboard-interactive plugin [11.7.2] to flexibly handle password expiration. Because that leaves only the generic_error code, the error_code mes- sage is itself not very useful. Perhaps someday the protocol will be extended to define other, more meaningful error codes, if they are needed to modify server operation.  Unfortunately, the server doesn’t currently  as of Tectia V476 Version 4.1  use the error message string for any purpose whatsoever. It isn’t forwarded to the client, so it can be displayed by the user, and it isn’t even recorded in the system log or mentioned in debug output. [5.9] It’s still a good idea for external authorization programs to send an error message back to the server, however, so that future versions of the server might be able to use it.  The error message is an arbitrary string that explains why access has been denied.  The external authorization program should be written carefully, since it runs with all of the privileges of the SSH server  typically root . Perl’s “taint mode” is useful for detecting possible security problems.  494    Chapter 11: Case Studies  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 12  CHAPTER 12 Troubleshooting and FAQ  OpenSSH and Tectia are complex products. When a problem occurs, your plan of action should be, in order:  1. Run the client and server in debug mode. 2. Consult archives of questions and answers to see if anyone else has encountered  and solved this problem.  3. Seek help.  Many people jump immediately to Step 3, posting questions in public forums and waiting hours or days for a reply, when a simple ssh –v or FAQ can clarify the prob- lem in moments. Be a smart and efficient technologist, and use your available resources before seeking help from the community.  Although the SSH community is eager to help if you’ve done your homework.   12.1 Debug Messages: Your First Line of Defense SSH clients and servers have debugging built in. When invoked with appropriate options, these programs emit messages about their progress and failures. You can use these messages to isolate problems.  Client Debugging  12.1.1 Most clients print debug messages when invoked with the –v  verbose mode  option: [7.4.17]  $ ssh -v server.example.com $ scp -v myfile server.example.com:otherfile  So many problems can be identified in verbose mode. This should be your first instinct whenever you encounter a problem.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  495   Please take a deep breath and repeat after us: “ssh –v is my friend….” “ssh –v is my friend….” “ssh –v is my friend….”  Server Debugging  12.1.2 The OpenSSH and Tectia servers also print debug messages when asked: [5.9]   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -e   Tectia $ sshd -v $ sshd -d debug_spec  In either case, the server enters a special debugging mode. It accepts a single connec- tion, operates normally until the connection terminates, and then exits. It doesn’t go into the background or create a child process to handle the connection, and it prints information on its progress to the screen  that is, to the standard error stream .  Tectia has a more complicated system for debugging: numeric debugging levels, specified with the –d option, where a higher number means more information. [5.9] In fact, –v for verbose mode is actually just a shorthand for –d2. At higher debug lev- els, the output is so huge that only SSH developers will likely find it of use in track- ing down obscure problems. But you may need to crank up the level beyond 2 to see the information you need. For example, to have it report which algorithms are nego- tiated for a connection, use –d3. If you get the error message “TCP IP Failure,” turn- ing up to –d5 shows the more specific OS-level error message returned from the connection attempt.  When debugging a server, remember to avoid port conflicts with any other running SSH server. Either terminate the other server, or use an alternative port number for debugging via the Port keyword or –p option. For example, using OpenSSH syntax, run the server:   OpenSSH $ sshd -d -e -p 54321  Then use the –p option in the client when testing this debugging instance of the server:  $ ssh -p 54321 localhost  This way, you don’t interrupt or affect another sshd in use.  496    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

A: Use ssh –v. Also, the system configuration may be overriding your settings.  12.2 Problems and Solutions In this section, we cover a wide range of difficulties, organized by category. The side- bar “The Top 10 SSH Questions” lists what, in our experience, are the most fre- quently asked of the frequently asked questions. We focus on problems that may occur in many versions of the SSH software on diverse operating systems. We don’t address the sorts of questions shown next that rapidly become obsolete.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    497     Compilation problems specific to one operating system, such as “HyperLinux  beta 0.98 requires the --with-woozle flag”    Problems and bugs that are specific to one version of SSH, particularly older  versions  In all questions, we will assume you have already used debug or verbose mode  e.g., ssh –v  to isolate the problem.  If you haven’t, you should!   12.2.1 General Problems Q: The commands ssh, scp, ssh-agent, ssh-keygen, etc., aren’t doing what I expect.  Even the help messages look weird.  A: Maybe they are Tectia programs when you are expecting OpenSSH, or vice  versa. Try running these commands to find out:  $ ssh -V $ ssh --help  Q: When I try to connect to an SSH server, I get the error “Connection refused.” A: No SSH server is running where you tried to connect. Double-check the host- name and TCP port number: perhaps the server is running on a port different from the default?  Q: When I log in, the message of the day   etc motd  prints twice. A: Both sshd and the login program are printing it. Disable sshd’s printing by set-  ting the serverwide configuration keyword PrintMotd to no.  Q: When I log in, I see two messages about email, such as “No mail” or “You have  mail.”  A: Both sshd and the login program are checking for mail. Prevent sshd from check-  ing by setting the serverwide configuration keyword CheckMail to no.  12.2.2 Authentication Problems  12.2.2.1 General authentication problems Q: The SSH server says “Permission denied” and exits. A: This occurs if all authentication techniques have failed. Run your client in debug mode and read the diagnostic messages, looking for clues. Also read our solu- tions to specific authentication problems in the rest of this section.  Q: How do I authenticate without typing a password or passphrase? A: The four available authentication methods for this are:    Public-key with ssh-agent   Public-key with an unencrypted key on disk  empty passphrase   498    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.     Trusted-host   Kerberos  Automatic authentication has a number of important issues you should care- fully consider before selecting from the preceding list. Read our case study on this topic. [11.1]  Q:  I get prompted for my password or passphrase, but before I have time to respond, the SSH server closes the connection.  A: Your server’s idle timeout value may be too short. If you are a system adminis- trator of a Tectia server machine, set IdleTimeout to a larger value in the server- wide configuration file. [5.3.3.5] If you are an end user of OpenSSH, set an idle- timeout value in authorized_keys. [8.2.7]  12.2.2.2 Password authentication Q: Password authentication isn’t working. A: Use ssh –v. If the connection is being refused altogether, the SSH server is proba- bly not running, or you are connecting to the wrong port. Port 22 is the default, but the remote system administrator might have changed it. If you see “permis- sion denied,” password authentication might be disabled in the server.  Make sure the server permits password authentication in the serverwide configuration file  PasswordAuthentication yes for OpenSSH, Allowed- Authentications password for Tectia . Also check your client configuration file to make sure you don’t have PasswordAuthentication no.  If you are prompted for your password, but it is rejected, you might accidentally be connecting to the wrong account. Does your local username differ from the remote username? Then you must specify the remote username when connecting:  $ ssh -l my_remote_username server.example.com $ scp myfile my_remote_username@server.example.com:  If this still doesn’t work, check your local client configuration file  ~ .ssh config or ~ .ssh2 ssh2_config  to make sure you haven’t accidentally set the wrong value for the User keyword. In particular, if your configuration file contains Host val- ues with wildcards, check that your current command line  the one that isn’t working  isn’t matching the wrong section in the file. [7.1.2.4]  One common problem on the server side involves OpenSSH and Pluggable Authentication Modules configuration. PAM is a general system for performing authentication, authorization, and accounting in an application-independent fashion. If your operating system supports PAM  as Linux and HPUX do, for example , OpenSSH will probably have been automatically compiled to use it. Unless you take the extra step of configuring PAM to support SSH, all password  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    499   authentication will mysteriously fail. This is usually just a matter of copying the appropriate sshd.pam file from the contrib directory in the OpenSSH distribu- tion, naming the copy “sshd,” and placing it in the PAM configuration directory  usually  etc pam.d  . The contrib directory contains several example files for dif- ferent flavors of Unix. For example, on a Red Hat Linux system:   cp contrib redhat sshd.pam  etc pam.d sshd  chown root.root  etc pam.d sshd  chmod 644  etc pam.d sshd  If OpenSSH isn’t using PAM, and password authentication still isn’t working, the compilation options --with-md5-passwords or --without-shadow might be relevant. These make no difference if PAM support is enabled in OpenSSH, because they deal with how OpenSSH reads the Unix passwd map. When using PAM, the OpenSSH code doesn’t read the passwd map directly; the PAM libraries do it instead. Without PAM, though, if your system is using MD5- hashed passwords instead of the more traditional crypt  DES  hash, you must use --with-md5-passwords. You can tell which hash your system is using by inspecting the  etc passwd and  etc shadow files. The hashed password is the second field in each entry; if the password field in  etc passwd is just “x”, then the real entry is in  etc shadow instead. MD5 hashes are much longer and con- tain a wider range of characters:    etc shadow, MD5 hash test:$1$tEMXcnZB$rDEZbQXJzUz4g2J4qYkRh.:...    etc shadow, crypt hash test:JGQfZ8DeroV22:...  Finally, you can try the compilation option --without-shadow if you suspect OpenSSH is trying to use the shadow password file, but your system doesn’t use it.  Q: The server won’t let me use an empty password. A: Empty passwords are insecure and should be avoided. Nevertheless, you can set  PermitEmptyPasswords yes in the serverwide configuration file. [5.4.2.2]  12.2.2.3 Hostbased authentication Q: Hostbased authentication isn’t working. A: Use ssh –v. If everything looks right, check the following. Suppose the client user is orpheus@earth, and the target account is orpheus@hades—that is, on host earth, user orpheus invokes ssh hades.  500    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   For OpenSSH:    PubkeyAuthentication yes belongs in the server and client configurations.   EnableSSHKeysign yes must be in the server configuration.   A copy of earth’s public host key must be in hades: etc ssh ssh_known_hosts   or hades:~orpheus: .ssh known_hosts2 .  is  coming  address  from the    The entry may be in the target account’s known hosts file instead, i.e., in hades:~orpheus .ssh known_hosts. Take care that “earth” is the canonical name of the client host from the server’s point of view. That is, if the SSH connection then gethostbyname 192.168.10.1  on hades must return “earth,” and not a nickname or alias for the host  e.g., if the hostname is river.earth.net, the lookup must not return just “river” . Note that this can involve multiple naming services, since gethostbyname can be configured to consult multi- ple sources to determine a translation  e.g., DNS, NIS,  etc hosts . See  etc  nsswitch.conf. If your systems don’t agree on canonical hostnames, you’ll have no end of trouble with hostbased authentication. You can work around such problems to an extent by manually adding extra host nick- names to the known hosts file, like this:  192.168.10.1,  earth,gaia,terra 1024 37 71641647885140363140390131934...  For Tectia:  client configurations.    AllowedAuthentications must include the value hostbased in the server and    ssh-signer must be setuid root. More precisely, it needs to be able to read the private host key, which in the normal installation means it must be setuid root.    A copy of earth’s public host key in hades: etc ssh2 knownhosts earth.ssh-dss. pub  or hades:~orpheus: .ssh2 knownhosts earth.ssh-dss.pub, if you specified UserKnownHosts yes on the server .    Regarding canonical hostnames, the same comments as for OpenSSH apply.  12.2.2.4 Public-key authentication Q: How do I install my public key file on the remote host the first time? A: Here’s the general method:  a. Generate a key pair. b. Copy the text of the public key into your computer’s clipboard or other cut   paste buffer.  c. Log into the remote host via SSH with password authentication, which  doesn’t require any special files in your remote account.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    501   d. Edit the appropriate authorization and key files on the remote host:    For OpenSSH, append the public key to ~ .ssh authorized_keys. Alterna-  tively, run the program ssh-copy-id. [2.4.3]    For Tectia, paste the public key into a new .pub file in ~ .ssh2  say, to ~ .ssh2   newkey.pub  line  Key  newkey.pub , and append the authorization.  e. Log out from the remote host. f. Log back into the remote host using public-key authentication.  When editing the remote authorization file, make sure your text editor doesn’t insert line breaks into the middle of a public key. OpenSSH public keys are very long and must be kept on a single line.  Q:  I put my SSH public-key file, mykey.pub, into my remote SSH directory, but pub- lic-key authentication doesn’t work.  A: Placing a valid public-key file  e.g., mykey.pub  in your SSH directory isn’t suffi- cient. For OpenSSH you must append the key  i.e., the contents of mykey.pub  to ~ .ssh authorized_keys. For Tectia, you must add a line of text to ~ .ssh2  authorization, Key mykey.pub.  Q: Public-key authentication isn’t working. A:  Invoke the client in debug mode  ssh –v . Make sure:    Your local client is using the expected identity file   The correct public key is on the remote host in the right location   Your remote home directory, SSH directory, and other SSH-related files  have the correct permissions [5.3.2.1]  Q:  I’m being prompted for my login password instead of my public-key passphrase. Or, my connection is rejected with the error message “No further authentication methods available.”  Tectia   A: There are several possible causes for both of these problems:    Public-key authentication must be enabled in both the client and server yes, Tectia AllowedAuthentications   OpenSSH PubkeyAuthentication publickey .    Specify your remote username with –l  lowercase L  if it differs from your local username, or else the SSH server will examine the wrong remote account:  $ ssh -l jones server.example.com    Check the file permissions in your server account. If certain files or directo- ries have the wrong owner or careless access permissions, the SSH server refuses to perform public-key authentication. This is a security feature. Run ssh in verbose mode to reveal the problem:  502    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   $ ssh -v server.example.com ... server.example.com: Remote: Bad file modes for  u smith .ssh  In your server account, make sure that the following files and directories are owned by you and are not world-writable: ~  your home directory , ~ .ssh, ~ .ssh authorized_keys, ~ .ssh2, ~ .rhosts, and ~ .shosts.    For Tectia, if you use the –i option to specify an identification file:  $ ssh -i my-identity server.example.com  check that my-identity is an identification file, not a private-key file.  In con- trast, ssh –i for OpenSSH expects a private-key file.  Remember that Tectia identification files are text files containing the names of private keys.  I’m being prompted for the passphrase of the wrong key.  Q: A: Make sure your desired public key is in your authorization file on the SSH server machine. Also check for typographical errors in any options specified for the key. [8.2] A mistyped option causes the associated key line to be skipped silently. Remember that options are separated by commas, not whitespace.  Q: A:  I ran ssh-agent, but when I run ssh-add to add keys, it cannot find the agent. ssh-add can communicate with ssh-agent only if certain environment variables are set. These variables—SSH_AUTH_SOCK for OpenSSH and SSH2_AUTH_SOCK for Tectia—direct ssh-add to the socket used by ssh-agent. The environment vari- ables are set automatically if you run the agent correctly. [6.3.2] This implies that any shells run before ssh-agent won’t know how to contact it.  In the shell where you’re running the failed ssh-add, check for the presence of the appropriate environment variable:  $ env  grep SSH SSH_AGENT_PID=7206 SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-gckksA7161 agent.7161  If you don’t see it, then either you didn’t run the agent correctly, you ran this shell before you ran ssh-agent, or you’re not properly exporting the SSH_AUTH_ SOCK variable. If you do see the socket variable, then perhaps it has an old value  from a previously run and now-dead agent . Try opening a new shell and run- ning ssh-add.  12.2.2.5 PGP key authentication Q: After the PGP passphrase prompt, I am being prompted for my login password. A:  If you get prompted for your PGP key, and then your password:    Passphrase for pgp key "mykey": ********   smith's password:  first make sure you’re typing your PGP passphrase correctly.  For instance, PGP- encrypt a file with that public key and decrypt it.  If so, then there might be an  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    503   incompatibility between the PGP implementations on your client and server machines. We’ve seen this behavior when the PGP key  generated on the client machine  doesn’t have sufficient bits for the PGP implementation on the server machine. Generate a new key on the server machine.  I get “Invalid pgp key id number ‘0276C297’”.  Q: A: You probably forgot the leading “0x” on the key ID, and SSH is trying to inter-  pret a hexadecimal number as a decimal. Use PgpKeyId 0x0276C297 instead.  12.2.3 Key and Agent Problems  12.2.3.1 ssh-keygen Q:  I generated an OpenSSH key and tried using it with Tectia, but it didn’t work.  Or vice versa.   A: This is normal. OpenSSH and Tectia  SECSH  keys aren’t compatible. How-  ever, you can convert one to the other with ssh-keygen. [6.2.1]  Q: Each time I run ssh-keygen, it overwrites my default identity file. A: Tell ssh-keygen to write its output to a different file. For ssh-keygen in OpenSSH, use the –f option. For Tectia, specify the filename as the last argument on the command line; no option is needed.  Q: Can I change the passphrase for a key without regenerating the key? A: Yes. For ssh-keygen in OpenSSH, use the –N option, and for Tectia use the –p  option.  Q: How do I generate a host key? A: Generate a key with an empty passphrase and install it in the correct location.  The OpenSSH source distribution has a Makefile target to do this:   cd directory_containing_source_code  make host-key  make host-key-force  Will not overwrite existing keys Will overwrite existing keys  or you can do it manually:   ssh-keygen -t rsa1 -f  usr local etc ssh_host_key -N ""  ssh-keygen -t dsa -f  usr local etc ssh_host_dsa_key -N ""  ssh-keygen -t rsa -f  usr local etc ssh_host_rsa_key -N ""  Likewise, the Tectia source distribution has a Makefile target:   cd directory_containing_source_code  make generate-host-key Will not overwrite existing key  or you can do it manually:   ssh-keygen -P -t dsa -c "DSA hostkey"  etc ssh2 hostkey  504    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Q: Generating a key takes a long time. A: Yes it may, depending on the speed of your CPU and the number of bits you  have requested. DSA keys tend to take longer than RSA keys.  Q: How many bits should I make my keys? A: We recommend at least 1024 bits for strong security.  Q: What does oOo.oOo.oOo.oOo mean, as printed by Tectia’s ssh-keygen? A: The manpage calls it a “progress indicator.” We think it’s an ASCII representa- tion of a sine wave. Or the sound of a chattering gorilla. You can hide it with the –q flag.  12.2.3.2 ssh-agent and ssh-add Q: My ssh-agent isn’t terminating after I log out. A:  If you use the single-shell method to start an agent, this is normal. You must ter- minate the agent yourself, either manually  bleah  or by including appropriate lines in your shell configuration files. [6.3.2.1] If you use the subshell method, the agent automatically terminates when you log out  actually, when you exit the subshell . [6.3.2.2]  Q: When I invoke ssh-add and type my passphrase, I get the error message “Could not  open a connection to your authentication agent.”  A: Follow this debugging process:  a. Make sure you are running an ssh-agent process:  $  usr bin ps -ef  grep ssh-agent smith 22719     1  0 23:34:44 ?        0:00 ssh-agent  If not, you need to run an agent before ssh-add will work.  b. Check that the agent’s environment variables are set:  $ env  grep SSH SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-barrett ssh-22719-agent SSH_AGENT_PID=22720  If not, then you probably ran ssh-agent incorrectly, like this:   Wrong! $ ssh-agent    $ eval `ssh-agent`  $ ssh-agent $SHELL  For the single-shell method, you must use eval with backquotes:  Or for the subshell method, you must instruct ssh-agent to invoke a shell:  c. Make sure the agent points to a valid socket:  $ ls -lF $SSH_AUTH_SOCK prwx------   1 smith   0 May 14 23:37  tmp ssh-smith ssh-22719-agent  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    505   If not, your SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable might be pointing to an old socket from a previous invocation of ssh-agent, due to user error. Terminate and restart the agent properly.  12.2.3.3 Per-account authorization ﬁles Q: My per-account server configuration isn’t taking effect. A: Check the following:    You might be confused about which versions of SSH use which files:  OpenSSH  Tectia  ~ .ssh authorized_keys  ~ .ssh2 authorization    Remember that the authorized_keys file contains keys, whereas the Tectia  authorization file contains directives referring to other key files.    You might have a typographical error in one of these files. Check the spell- ing of options, and remember to separate OpenSSH authorized_keys options with commas, not whitespace. For example:   correct no-x11-forwarding,no-pty 1024 35 8697511247987525784866526224505...   INCORRECT  will silently fail  no-x11-forwarding no-pty 1024 35 8697511247987525784866526224505...  ALSO INCORRECT  note the extra space after "no-x11-forwarding,"  no-x11-forwarding, no-pty 1024 35 8697511247987525784866526224505...  12.2.4  Server Problems  12.2.4.1 sshd_conﬁg, sshd2_conﬁg Q: How do I get sshd to recognize a new configuration file? A: You can terminate and restart sshd, but there’s quicker way: send the “hangup”  signal  SIGHUP  to sshd with kill –HUP.  Q:  A:  I changed the sshd config file and sent SIGHUP to the server. But it didn’t seem to make any difference. sshd may have been invoked with a command-line option that overrides that keyword. Command-line options remain in force and take precedence over configuration-file keywords. Try terminating and restarting sshd.  506    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

A: The feature might have been disabled by a system administrator, either when the SSH software was compiled  Chapter 4  or during serverwide configuration  Chapter 5 . Compile-time flags cannot be checked easily, but serverwide config- urations are found in the files  etc ssh sshd_config  OpenSSH  or  etc ssh2 sshd2_ config  Tectia . Ask your system administrator for assistance.  ssh or scp is behaving unexpectedly, using features I didn’t request.  12.2.5.2 Client conﬁguration ﬁle Q: A: The program might be responding to keywords specified in your client configu- ration file. [7.1.2] Remember that multiple sections of the config file apply if multiple Host lines match the remote machine name you specified on the com- mand line.  Q: My OpenSSH ~ .ssh config file doesn’t seem to work right. A: Remember that after the first use of a Host directive in the config file, all state- ments are inside some Host block  because one Host block is terminated only by the start of another . The ssh manpage suggests that you put defaults at the end of the config file, which is correct; when looking up a directive in the config file, ssh uses the first match it finds, so defaults should go after any Host blocks. But don’t let your own indentation or whitespace fool you. The end of your file might look like this:  You intend that the username for logging into server.example.com is “linda”, and the default username for hosts not explicitly listed earlier is “smith”. However, the line User smith is still inside the Host server.example.com block. And since there’s an earlier User statement for server.example.com, User smith never matches anything, and ssh appears to ignore it. The right thing to do is this:   last Host block Host server.example.com  User linda   defaults User smith   last Host block Host server.example.com  User linda   defaults Host *  User smith  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    507   Q: My Tectia ~ .ssh2 ssh2_config file doesn’t seem to work right. A:  See our answer to the previous question for OpenSSH. However, Tectia has the opposite precedence rule: if multiple configurations match your target, then the last, not the first, prevails. Therefore, your defaults go at the beginning of the file.  12.2.5.3 ssh Q:  I want to suspend ssh with the escape sequence but I am running more than two levels of ssh  machine to machine to machine . How do I suspend an intermediate ssh?  A: One method is to start each ssh with a different escape character; otherwise, the  earliest ssh client in the chain interprets the escape character and suspends.  Or you can be clever. Remember that if you type the escape character twice, that’s the meta-escape: it allows you to send the escape character itself, circum- venting its usual special function. So, if you have several chained ssh sessions all using the default escape character ~, you can suspend the nth one by pressing the Return key, then n tildes, then Control-Z.  Q:  I ran an ssh command in the background on the command line, and it suspended itself, not running unless I “fg” it.  A: Use the –n command-line option, which instructs ssh not to read from stdin  actually, it reopens stdin on  dev null instead of your terminal . Otherwise, the shell’s job-control facility suspends the program if it reads from stdin while in the background. Or better: use ssh -f  possibly with –N . [9.2.6]  ssh prints “Compression level must be from 1  fast  to 9  slow, best ” and exits.  Q: A: Your CompressionLevel is set to an illegal value for this host, probably in your  ~ .ssh config file. It must be an integer between 1 and 9, inclusive. [7.4.14]  Q: ssh prints “Cannot fork into background without a command to execute” and exits. A: You used the –f flag of ssh, didn’t you? This tells the client to put itself into the background as soon as authentication completes, and then execute whatever remote command you requested. But, you didn’t provide a remote command. You typed something like:   This is wrong $ ssh -f server.example.com  The –f flag makes sense only when you give ssh a command to run after it goes into the background:  $ ssh -f server.example.com  bin who  508    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Q:  ssh prints “No host key is known for   and you have requested strict checking  or ‘cannot confirm operation when running in batch mode’ ,” and exits.  A: The client can’t find the server’s host key in its known-hosts list, and it is config- ured not to add it automatically  or is running in batch mode, so it can’t prompt you about adding it . You must add it manually to your per-account or system- wide known-hosts files.  ssh prints “Selected cipher type...not supported by server” and exits.  Q: A: You requested that ssh use a particular encryption cipher, but the SSH server doesn’t support it. Normally, the SSH client and server negotiate to determine which cipher to use, so you probably forced a particular cipher by providing the –c flag on the ssh command line or by using the Cipher keyword in the configura- tion file. Either don’t specify a cipher and let the client and server work it out, or select a different cipher.  Q: A:  ssh prints “channel_request_remote_forwarding: too many forwards” and exits. ssh has a static limit of 100 forwardings per session, and you’ve requested more.  12.2.5.4 scp Q:  scp printed an error message: “Write failed flushing stdout buffer. write stdout: Broken pipe.” or “packet too long”.  A: Your shell startup file  e.g., ~ .cshrc, ~ .bashrc , which is run when scp connects, might be writing a message on standard output. These interfere with the com- munication between the two scp programs. If you don’t see any obvious output commands, look for stty or tset commands that might be printing something.  Either remove the offending statement from the startup file, or suppress it for noninteractive sessions:  if  $?prompt  then   echo 'Here is the message that screws up scp.' endif  scp printed an error message, “Not a regular file.”  Q: A: Are you trying to copy a directory? Use the –r option for a recursive copy. Other- wise, you may be trying to copy a special file that it doesn’t make sense to copy, such as a device node, socket, or named pipe. If you do an ls –l of the file in ques- tion and the first character in the file description is something other than “–”  for a regular file  or “d”  for a directory , this is probably what’s happening. You didn’t really want to copy that file, did you?  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    509   Q: Why don’t wildcards or shell variables work on the scp command line? A: Remember that wildcards and variables are expanded by the local shell first, not  on the remote machine. This happens even before scp runs. So if you type:  $ scp server.example.com:a* .  the local shell attempts to find local files matching the pattern server.example. com:a*. This is probably not what you intended. You probably wanted files matching a* on server.example.com to be copied to the local machine.  Some shells, notably the C shell and its derivatives, simply report “No match” and exit. The Bourne shell and its derivatives  sh, ksh, bash , finding no match, will actually pass the string server.example.com:a* to the server as you’d hoped.  Similarly, if you want to copy your remote mail file to the local machine, the command:  $ scp server.example.com:$MAIL .  might not do what you intend. $MAIL is expanded locally before scp executes. Unless  by coincidence  $MAIL is the same on the local and remote machines, the command won’t behave as expected.  Don’t rely on shell quirks and coincidences to get your work done. Instead, escape your wildcards and variables so that the local shell won’t attempt to expand them:  $ scp server.example.com:a\* . $ scp 'server.example.com:$MAIL' .  Q:  I used scp to copy a file from the local machine to a remote machine. It ran with- out errors. But when I logged into the remote machine, the file wasn’t there!  A: By any chance, did you omit a colon? Suppose you want to copy the file myfile  from the local machine to server.example.com. A correct command is:  $ scp myfile server.example.com:  but if you forget the final colon:     This is wrong!   $ scp myfile server.example.com  myfile gets copied locally to a file called “server.example.com”. Check for such a file on the local machine.  510    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Even if you can limit the access to scp, this doesn’t protect your  login permissions?  account. Your friend could run:  $ scp evil_authorized_keys you@your.host:.ssh authorized_keys  Oops, your friend has just replaced your authorized_keys file, giving himself full login permissions. Maybe you can accomplish what you want with a clever forced command, limiting the set of programs your friend may run in your account. [8.2.3.3]  scp –p preserves file timestamps and modes. Can it preserve file ownership?  Q: A: No. Ownership of remote files is determined by SSH authentication. Suppose user smith has accounts on local computer L and remote computer R. If the local smith copies a file by scp to the remote smith account, authenticating by SSH, then the remote file is owned by the remote smith. If you want the file to be owned by a different remote user, scp must authenticate as that different user. scp has no other knowledge of users and uids, and besides, only root can change file ownership  on most modern Unix variants, anyway .  Q: OK, scp -p doesn’t preserve file ownership information. But I am the superuser, and I’m trying to copy a directory hierarchy between machines  scp -r  and the files have a variety of owners. How can I preserve the ownership information in the copies?  A: Don’t use scp for this purpose. There are better ways, with tar:   tar cpf - local_dir   ssh remote_machine "cd remote_dir; tar xpf -"   or rsync:   rsync -ra -e ssh local_dir remote_machine: remote_dir  The rsync method has the advantage of being interruptible and resumable with- out retransferring files.  12.2.5.5 sftp Q: A:  sftp reports “Cipher   is not supported. Connection lost.” Internally, sftp invokes an ssh command to contact sftp-server. [3.7.3] It searches the user’s PATH to locate the ssh executable rather than a hardcoded location. If you have more than one SSH product installed on your system, sftp might invoke the wrong ssh program. This can produce the error message shown.  sftp reports “ssh_packet_wrapper_input: invalid packet received.”  Q: A: Although this error appears mysterious, its cause is mundane. A command in the remote account’s shell startup file is printing something to standard output, even  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  12.2 Problems and Solutions    511   though stdout isn’t a terminal in this case, and sftp is trying to interpret this unexpected output as part of the SFTP packet protocol. It fails and dies.  You see, sshd uses the shell to start the sftp-server subsystem. The user’s shell startup file prints something, which the SFTP client tries to interpret as an SFTP protocol packet. This fails, and the client exits with the error message; the first field in a packet is the length field, which is why it’s always that message.  To fix this problem, be sure your shell startup file doesn’t print anything unless it’s running interactively. tcsh, for example, sets the variable $interactive if stdin is a terminal.  I’m trying to do port forwarding, but ssh complains: “bind: Address already in use.“  12.2.5.6 Port forwarding Q: A: The port you’re trying to forward is already being used by another program on the listening side  the local host if it’s a –L forwarding or the remote host if it’s a –R . Try using the netstat –a command, available on most Unix implementa- tions and some Windows platforms. If you see an entry for your port in the LISTEN state, you know that something else is using that port. Check to see whether you’ve inadvertently left another ssh command running that’s forward- ing the same port. Otherwise, just choose another, unused port to forward.  This problem can occur when there doesn’t appear to be any other program using your port, especially if you’ve been experimenting with the forwarding fea- ture and have repeatedly used the same ssh to forward the same port. If the last one of these died unexpectedly  you interrupted it, or it crashed, or the connec- tion was forcibly closed from the other side, etc. , the local TCP socket may have been left in the TIME_WAIT state  you may see this if you used the netstat program as described earlier . When this happens, you have to wait a few minutes for the socket to time out of this state and become free for use again. Of course, you can just choose another port number if you’re impatient.  Q: How do I secure FTP with port forwarding? A: This is a complex topic. [11.2] FTP has two types of TCP connections: control and data. The control connection carries your login name, password, and FTP commands; it is on TCP port 21 and can be forwarded by the standard method. In two windows, run:  $ ssh -L2001:name.of.server.com:21 name.of.server.com $ ftp localhost 2001  Your FTP client probably needs to run in passive mode  execute the passive command . FTP data connections carry the files being transferred. These con- nections occur on randomly selected TCP ports and can’t be forwarded in  512    Chapter 12: Troubleshooting and FAQ  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Q: X forwarding isn’t working. A: Use ssh –v, and see if the output points out an obvious problem. If not, check  the following:    Make sure you have X working before using SSH. Try running a simple X client such as xlogo or xterm first. Your local DISPLAY variable must be set, or SSH doesn’t attempt X forwarding.    X forwarding must be turned on in the client and server, and not disallowed by the target account  that is, with no-X11-forwarding in the authorized_keys file .    sshd must be able to find the xauth program to run it on the remote side. If it can’t, this should show up when running ssh -v. You can fix this on the server side with the XAuthLocation directive  OpenSSH , or by setting a PATH  that contains xauth  in your remote shell startup file.    Don’t set the DISPLAY variable yourself on the remote side. sshd automati- cally sets this value correctly for the forwarding session. If you have com- mands in your login or shell startup files that unconditionally set DISPLAY, change the code to set it only if X forwarding isn’t in use.    OpenSSH sets the remote XAUTHORITY variable as well, placing the xauth cre- dentials file under  tmp. Make sure you haven’t overridden this setting, which should look like:  $ echo $XAUTHORITY  tmp ssh-maPK4047 cookies  Some flavors of Unix actually have code in the standard shell startup files  e.g.,  etc bashrc,  etc csh.login  that unconditionally sets XAUTHORITY to ~ .Xauthority. If that’s the problem, you must ask the sysadmin to fix it; the startup file should set XAUTHORITY only if the variable is unset.    If you are using an SSH startup file   etc ssh sshrc or ~ .ssh rc , sshd doesn’t run xauth for you on the remote side to add the proxy key; one of these startup files must do it, receiving the proxy key type and data on standard input from sshd.    Try ssh -Y  OpenSSH  or ssh2 +X  Tectia  to make forwarded X clients  “trusted” by the display server.

Chapter 13  CHAPTER 13 Overview of Other Implementations  SSH products are available not only for Unix, but also for Windows, Macintosh, Amiga, OS 2, VMS, BeOS, PalmOS, Windows CE, and Java. Some programs are original, finished products, and others are ports of OpenSSH or of Tectia ancestors, undertaken by volunteers and in various stages of completion.  In the remaining chapters of this book, we cover several robust implementations of SSH for Windows and the Macintosh. But first, in this chapter, we quickly survey SSH products for many platforms.  We have set up a web page pointing to SSH-related products that we know. From this book’s catalog page:  http:  www.oreilly.com catalog sshtdg   follow the link labeled Author’s Online Resources, or visit us directly at:  Also check out this third-party page listing many free SSH implementations:  http:  www.snailbook.com   http:  www.freessh.org   13.1 Common Features Every SSH implementation has a different set of features, but virtually all have one thing in common: a client program for logging into remote systems securely. Some clients are command line–based, and others operate like graphical terminal emula- tors, opening windows with dozens of configurable settings.  The remaining features vary widely across implementations. Secure file copy  scp and sftp , remote batch command execution, SSH servers, SSH agents, and particu- lar authentication and encryption algorithms are found in only some of the prod- ucts. Most include a generator of public and private keys.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Because SSH products need to remain secure, we list only products that are in active development  or at least have been updated in the past year or two  and that support the SSH-2 protocol. This means we’ve intentionally left out dozens of older SSH products with respected histories, like NiftyTelnet SSH for the Mac, Top Gun SSH for Palm, FISH for VMS, and Sergey Okhapkin’s classic Windows port of the original SSH1. Old-timers like these have their place in history, but have been supplanted by more modern implementations.  We’ve organized the products by platform. Some products are free and others are shareware or commercial, usually quite inexpensive. Additionally, many of the com- mercial products have free evaluation versions available, so you can try before you buy.  13.3.1 BeOS At press time, we have found no modern SSH clients for BeOS. There are a bunch of ancient ones  2000–2002  supporting the old SSH-1 protocol: search http:  www. bebits.com  to find them.  Commodore Amiga  13.3.2 At press time, we have found no modern SSH clients for the Amiga. The closest is an Amiga port of OpenSSH  http:  www.chernoff.org amiga , free . However, it’s a port of Version 3.0.2, which is several years out of date.  516    Chapter 13: Overview of Other Implementations  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

All rights reserved.   Chapter 14  CHAPTER 14 OpenSSH for Windows  OpenSSH, though originally written for Unix-like operating systems, runs well under Windows too. If you prefer command-line programs rather than a GUI, OpenSSH is probably your best bet for a free SSH implementation.  In order to run OpenSSH on Windows, you must install the Cygwin library  http:   www.cygwin.com   and associated programs. The installation is pretty simple but large: some users complain about the added “bloat” of Cygwin’s many programs. If this concerns you, check out OpenSSH For Windows  http:  sshwindows.sourceforge. net  , a minimal installation of OpenSSH and Cygwin. Our perspective, however, is that Cygwin comes with so many mind-bogglingly useful tools  ported from Unix  that you might as well do a full install.  In most cases, OpenSSH operates the same way under Windows as it does under Unix. In this chapter we’ll cover only the differences; in Chapter 15 we will cover OpenSSH on the Macintosh similarly.  Like Unix, Cygwin uses the term “directory” to refer to a folder. We will use the Cygwin terminology.  14.1 Installation Cygwin is available from http:  www.cygwin.com . Download the installation pro- gram and run it. Make sure to install the following packages:  openssh  cygrunsrv  The full suite of programs and support files  A program needed to run sshd as a Windows service  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  521   Once Cygwin is installed, complete the setup:  1. Make sure that c:\cygwin\bin is in your search path. 2. Create an environment variable called CYGWIN, and give it the value ntsec tty.  14.2 Using the SSH Clients The client programs ssh, scp, and sftp work just as they do on Unix:   Log into server.example.com as user smith $ ssh -l smith server.example.com   Copy myfile from your local machine to server.example.com $ scp myfile server.example.com:   Run an interactive file-copy session with sftp $ sftp server.example.com  The only bit of trickiness is locating your ~ .ssh directory via Windows. On Unix platforms, your home directory is located in an obvious place, usually  home  yourname. And in fact, if you run a Cygwin shell, you can literally refer to  home  yourname as well. But what if you’re using a standard Windows command shell  e.g., cmd  or browsing files with Windows Explorer: how can you find your ~ .ssh direc- tory? Simply type this command from a Windows command shell:  C:\> cygpath -w ~ C:\cygwin\home\smith  The cygpath command converts Cygwin paths into Windows paths, and the lone tilde  ~  represents your Cygwin home directory. In this example, cygpath reveals your home directory to be C:\cygwin\home\smith. Thus, your SSH-related client files will be stored in the directory C:\cygwin\home\smith\.ssh.  14.3 Setting Up the SSH Server The SSH server, sshd, runs under Cygwin as a standard Windows service, called  not surprisingly  Cygwin SSH Service. Cygwin provides a script, called ssh-host-config, to set this up. Here’s what to do:  The Cygwin SSH Service  a.k.a. sshd  runs only on flavors of Win- dows that support services: NT, 2000, XP, 2003, etc.  1. Make sure you’ve set up the path and environment variables for OpenSSH and  Cygwin. [14.1]  2. From an account with administrative privileges, run:  C:\> ssh-host-config  522    Chapter 14: OpenSSH for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3. Answer yes to all questions. 4. When ssh-host-config completes, your service should be ready to run. Open your Services control panel, look for Cygwin SSHD Service, and start the service. Alternatively, use the command line:  C:\> net start sshd  You might also want to set the service startup to Automatic, so it runs whenever you boot the computer. To stop the service, again use the Services control panel or type:  C:\> net stop sshd  If the service refuses to run, here are some things to try:    Make sure the file  var log sshd.log is writable by the SYSTEM account.   Read  var log sshd.log for error messages.  To test the server, connect to yourself:  C:\> ssh localhost  You should be prompted for your password and be able to log in.  Serverwide configuration files are found in  etc, such as  etc sshd_ config. This is in contrast to Unix-like systems that usually keep these files in  etc ssh.  14.3.1 Opening Remote Windows on the Desktop If you want to run graphical applications via ssh that open windows, such as notepad or regedit:  C:\> ssh my-pc-name notepad  this will not work unless you grant sshd permission to do so. Here’s how to do it on Windows XP and 2000:  1. Open the Services control panel. 2. Stop the Cygwin sshd service. 3. Double-click the Cygwin sshd service to view its properties. 4. Select the Log On tab. 5. Under “Log on as,” select the Local System account and check the box “Allow  service to interact with desktop.”  6. Click OK and restart the Cygwin sshd service.  Before doing this, however, carefully consider the security implications. You’re per- mitting any user with SSH privileges—not just the logged-in user, not just adminis- trators—to open windows on the desktop remotely.

All rights reserved.  14.3 Setting Up the SSH Server    523   14.4 Public-Key Authentication The OpenSSH clients—ssh, scp, and sftp—and the key-related programs—ssh-key- gen, ssh-agent, and ssh-add  covered in Chapter 6 —use public-key authentication just as they do under Unix. You might need to know where your ~ .ssh folder is to refer to keys. [14.2]  When connecting to the Cygwin SSHD Service  sshd  from the outside world, there are a few things to think about:    Make sure your ~ .ssh authorized_keys file contains the appropriate public keys.  [6.1.1]    Check the Cygwin SSHD Service in the Services control panel, and note the NT  user account under which it is running. Then make sure that this account: — Has read access to your ~ .ssh directory and your ~ .ssh authorized_keys file. — Has read access to the host keys in the Cygwin  etc directory. — Has write access to the log file  var log sshd.log. — Is in the local Administrators group, if you plan to invoke operations by SSH that require administrative privileges. Then authenticate using this account.  For more flexible credentials, consider a PKI solution. [11.5] Cygwin includes a Kerberos package.*   — Is listed in the Cygwin  etc passwd file. Use the Cygwin mkpasswd program  to generate this file if you need; for example, in the Cygwin shell:  $ mkpasswd -l >  etc passwd  but make sure you understand what you’re doing so that you don’t wipe out vital accounts! Run man mkpasswd to learn more.  14.4.1 Running an Agent An agent is a program that keeps private keys in memory and provides authentica- tion services to SSH clients. If you preload an agent with private keys at the begin- ning of a login session, your SSH clients won’t prompt for passphrases. Instead, they communicate with the agent as needed. [2.5] The OpenSSH agent program is ssh- agent.  In order for ssh-agent to work, it communicates via environment variables. [6.3.2] If you’re using the Cygwin shell  bash , you can start the agent via the same methods as  * For Kerberos or GSSAPI  time, KerberosAuthentication and GSSAPIAuthentication are disabled in the Cygwin binaries for OpenSSH. You’ll need to download the OpenSSH source code and recompile it with the GNU C compiler, gcc, also included with Cygwin. Once things are set up, they do work as in our case study. [11.5.2]  support., you might need to recompile OpenSSH. At press  524    Chapter 14: OpenSSH for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   on Unix. Unfortunately, these methods don’t work immediately on Windows if you’re using the command shell  cmd.exe or command.exe , so here is a quick recipe:  1. Run the agent:  C:\> ssh-agent SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-agent.1468; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=3212; export SSH_AGENT_PID; echo Agent pid 3212;  2. Notice the output includes some environment variables: SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-agent.1468; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK; SSH_AGENT_PID=3212; export SSH_AGENT_PID;  3. Set the environment variables by hand:  C:\> set SSH_AUTH_SOCK= tmp ssh-agent.1468 C:\> set SSH_AGENT_PID=3212  4. Your agent is ready to load with keys: [2.5]  C:\> ssh-add Enter passphrase for  home you .ssh id_dsa: ******** Identity added:  home you .ssh id_dsa   home you .ssh id_dsa   14.5 Troubleshooting The following lists some ideas for troubleshooting:    If  var log sshd.log says “Privilege separation user sshd does not exist,” then either turn off privilege separation in  etc sshd_config, or create the “sshd” account  e.g., with Cygwin’s useradd command .    Run filemon from the command line, and look for accesses to the ~ .ssh  directory.    In the Local Security Policy administrative tool, turn on auditing for object access: this is found under Local Policies Audit Policy. Set it to audit both suc- cess and failure. Then select the ~ .ssh folder and enable this auditing for all accesses to the folder and its contents  Properties Security Advanced Auditing .  14.6 Summary The full-featured OpenSSH suite runs on Windows for free.

The primary differences and distinguishing features are:    Some extra setup before the OpenSSH server, sshd, can be accessed by the out-  side world    The software, which is a modified version of OpenSSH maintained by Apple   Some important differences in the way sshd is configured by default, such as  invocation and Kerberos support  15.1 Using the SSH Clients The usual OpenSSH clients, ssh, scp, and sftp, work normally without any extra effort on your part:   Log into server.example.com as user smith $ ssh -l smith server.example.com   Copy myfile from your local machine to server.example.com $ scp myfile server.example.com:   Run an interactive file-copy session with sftp $ sftp server.example.com  15.2 Using the OpenSSH Server Before you can use sshd on Mac OS X, you’ll need to enable the server and possibly open up the Mac’s firewall. In addition, you’ll want to know about some configura- tion differences as compared to most other OpenSSH installations.  526  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Enabling the Server  15.2.1 SSH server startup is controlled from the Sharing pane in System Preferences, under Services, as in Figure 15-1. To enable sshd, select Remote Login and click the Start button.  Figure 15-1. Enabling the SSH server in System Preferences  15.2.2 Opening the Firewall By default, the Mac OS X personal firewall will block SSH connections from the out- side world. If you have this firewall enabled, you must manually permit SSH traffic through it. This is done from the Sharing pane in System Preferences, under Fire- wall, as in Figure 15-2.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  15.2 Using the OpenSSH Server    527   Figure 15-2. Opening a firewall hole for SSH in System Preferences  Control by xinetd  15.2.3 In most Unix-like operating systems, the OpenSSH server runs as a daemon, listen- ing for SSH connections. On Mac OS X, however, sshd is controlled by the super- server daemon, xinetd. [5.3.3.2] Whenever an SSH client attempts to contact sshd on TCP port 22, xinetd notices the attempt and invokes a single instance of sshd  specifi- cally, sshd -i  to serve that connection.  The xinetd configuration file for sshd is  etc xinetd.d ssh:    etc xinetd.d ssh: service ssh {         disable = no  528    Chapter 15: OpenSSH for Macintosh  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Server Conﬁguration Details  15.2.4 On Mac OS X, the serverwide configuration files are found in the  etc directory instead of the more common  etc ssh: for example, the serverwide configuration file is  etc sshd_config rather than  etc ssh sshd_config.  The SSH software is a modified version of OpenSSH maintained by Apple; they backport security fixes to it whenever required.  At press time, version “OpenSSH_3.6.1p1+CAN-2004-0175” has a bug whereby dynamic port forwarding  –D  doesn’t work: it listens on the specified port, but actual connection forwarding fails.  15.2.5 Kerberos Support The OS X OpenSSH build has protocol 2 Kerberos support for both user and server authentication, following the major Internet-Drafts on these  draft-ietf-secsh-gsskex and draft-ietf-galb-secsh-gssapi . It implements user authentication via the gssapi and external-keyx methods; it does not yet have the improved gssapi-with-mic method. In case a Kerberos-secured key exchange has been used for server authentication, the external-keyx method allows the userauth protocol to refer back to the previous Ker- beros exchange for user authentication, skipping an unnecessary extra authentica- tion phase.  This Kerberos support is also fully DNS-enabled, meaning it will find Kerberos authentication servers from information in the DNS if it is available. In a network of compatible and correctly configured Kerberos and OpenSSH servers, no extra config- uration is needed for a plain OS X host newly attached to the network to use Ker- beros for secure, single-signon client SSH connections. All that is required is to run:  $ kinit user@REALM Please enter the password for user@REALM: ******** $ ssh user@host  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  15.2 Using the OpenSSH Server    529   Place the following lines into  etc krb5.conf to relieve the user from having to specify the realm—and if the Kerberos principal and OS X account usernames are the same, then a simple kinit will suffice:  [libdefaults] default_realm        = REALM  Instead of the command-line utility kinit, you can use the OS X GUI Kerberos util- ity:  System Library CoreServices Kerberos.app.  530    Chapter 15: OpenSSH for Macintosh  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Chapter 16  CHAPTER 16 Tectia for Windows  Our treatment of Tectia in previous chapters has focused on Unix implementations, but Tectia is fully supported on Microsoft Windows platforms. It’s packaged as a suite of products, including:  Tectia Client  A GUI application that initiates outgoing SSH connections, with a terminal emu- lator, supporting key-management functionality, port forwarding, and file trans- fers using SFTP, plus command-line programs for scripting  Accession Lite  An authentication agent  Tectia Connector  Transparent, dynamic port forwarding for selected applications  Tectia Server  A service to accept incoming SSH connections  At press time, the Tectia products can be installed on the versions of Windows listed in Table 16-1. Consult the latest documentation for a complete list of supported platforms.  Table 16-1.

All rights reserved.  531   16.1 Obtaining and Installing Tectia products are shipped as Windows Installer Packages.* The easiest way to install is to use Windows Explorer to double-click on the included .msi files:    TectiaClient-version.msi   TectiaConnector-version.msi   TectiaServer-version.msi  These files can be found in the install windows folder on your distribution media, or downloaded from the ssh.com web site, depending on how you purchased the prod- ucts. The installers must be run by a user with administrative privileges. Installing the Connector package requires a reboot.  During interactive installation, you’ll see a series of dialogs; use these to specify the install directory if the default location is not appropriate. By default, Tectia products are installed within the Program Files folder in a Tectia subfolder named SSH Communications Security.† Files for each product are collected in separate subfolders under the Tectia subfolder:    SSH Secure Shell   SSH Accession Lite   SSH Tectia Connector   SSH Secure Shell Server    SSH Tectia Client   SSH Tectia Connector   SSH Tectia Server  We’ll refer to these as the “installation folders.” The installers also create entries in the Start Programs menu, under the program groups:  The installer for the Client package optionally creates desktop icons for the GUI cli- ent application:    SSH Tectia Client   SSH Tectia Client – File Transfer  The PATH environment variable is updated to include the installation folder for the Client package, so scripts can easily access command-line programs.  * Accession Lite is included with the Client and Connector packages and is not available as a separate package. † The Program Files folder can be determined by examining the value of the PROGRAMFILES environment vari-  able. It is typically C:\Program Files.  532    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The Server installer generates host key files by running ssh-keygen2 in a command window: this can take several minutes to complete.* The server is added as a service that starts automatically whenever the system boots.  Tectia products can also be installed silently, using the msiexec command-line tool:  C:\> msiexec  q  i Tectia - .msi INSTALLDIR=" "  If the INSTALLDIR argument is omitted, the default locations are used. Silent installa- tion is handy for rolling out products to a large number of systems.  To remove Tectia products, use the Add Remove Programs section of the Control Panel, or the command:  C:\> msiexec  q  x Tectia - .msi  The Tectia Server must be stopped before it is uninstalled.  16.2 Basic Client Use When you run the GUI client application  typically via the desktop icon or the Start menu , it displays a terminal window. To initiate an outgoing connection, do one of the following:    Click on the Connect toolbar icon.   Use the File Connect menu item.   Press the Enter key or space bar within an unconnected terminal window.  This brings up the Connect To Remote Host dialog shown in Figure 16-1. Fill out the values for the server’s hostname, the remote username  on the server , and the port number  if different from the default 22 ; select an authentication method from the drop-down menu; and finally click Connect. If the host key for the server has not been seen before, the client prompts for confirmation before saving it, as in Figure 16-2. Respond to the prompts demanded by subsequent dialogs, which depend on the authentication method chosen.  If authentication succeeds and the server grants access, you can work within the ter- minal window in Figure 16-3.  You can create additional sessions on the same server by using the New Terminal Window toolbar icon or the Window New Terminal menu item. These sessions run in separate terminal windows, and are tunneled through different channels within the existing SSH connection, so no additional authentication is required.  * If you run Server installer in silent mode, the host key is not generated automatically. Use ssh-keygen2 to gen-  erate the host key manually.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Encountering a previously unknown host key  The client disconnects automatically when the last session terminates. If you need to disconnect manually for some reason, use the Disconnect toolbar icon or the File  Disconnect menu item.  16.3 Key Management To manage the key pairs that are used for public-key authentication, use the Keys page  Figure 16-4  of the Settings dialog, which is accessed by either the Settings toolbar icon or the Edit Settings menu item. The Settings dialog is a GUI-based inter- face to the functionality provided by the ssh-keygen2 command-line program.  Click Generate New Keypair to start the Key Generation Wizard, which presents a dialog that prompts for the key type  DSA or RSA  and key length, generates the key  this can run for several minutes, which provides plenty of time to appreciate an ani- mated display of random bits , and finally prompts for a filename to store the key, an optional comment, and the passphrase.  To copy a key pair from files in some other location to the user profile folder, click Import. If an existing key is selected, click Export to copy the key pair from the user  534    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Terminal window  profile folder to some other folder, or Delete to remove the key pair, or Change Pass- phrase to present a dialog that prompts for the old and new passphrases.  Click Upload to conveniently transfer a selected public key to a server using sftp, and automatically add an entry in the authorization file so that the key will be used.* This assumes you have already authenticated using some other mechanism. A dialog allows the destination folder and authorization filename to be changed if the default locations on the server are not appropriate.  To view the contents of the public-key file  using the Notepad editor , double-click on a key in the list, or select a key and click View.  Finally, click Configure to update the identification file that is used by the ssh2 com- mand-line program. All keys in the list are included; the identification file must be edited manually if some keys should be excluded.  * Uploading is also offered as an option by the Key Generation Wizard whenever new key pairs are produced.

Keys page of the Settings dialog  16.4 Accession Lite Accession Lite is started automatically when each user logs in; it acts as an authenti- cation agent.* The GUI application provides the same functionality as the ssh-agent and ssh-add programs that are used on Unix systems.†  The easiest way to access the Accession Lite GUI, shown in Figure 16-5, is to double- click the icon in the tool tray on the taskbar. The Tectia Client and Connector appli- cations also have icons and menus for Accession Lite. Normally, Accession Lite stops  * By default, a splash screen is briefly displayed when the program starts. This can be disabled if you find it  annoying.  † These command-line programs are not provided with the Tectia Client product on Windows. Only Acces-  sion Lite can be used as an authentication agent.  536    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   automatically when the user logs out  or the system is shut down , but if it needs to be stopped manually for some reason, use the File  Quit menu item.  Figure 16-5. Accession Lite  The main Accession Lite window displays information about the loaded keys and a log of its operations in separate panes.  The toolbar icons or equivalent items in the Tools menu can be used to perform actions:    Add a key to the agent: a series of dialogs prompt for the filename and a pass-  phrase.    Delete a selected key from the agent.   Lock or unlock a selected key: dialogs prompt for a passphrase.   Edit attributes for a selected key:  this presents the Key Attributes page  Figure 16-6  of the Settings dialog, which can also be obtained via the Settings toolbar icon or the Edit Settings menu item.  The default attributes apply to all of the keys, unless overridden for specific keys. Keys can be set to expire after a specified time, and can be limited to a maximum number of uses. Forwarding can be restricted to a limited number of hops, or more  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

[6.3.3]  A short alias can be assigned to each key; these are optionally displayed by the GUI instead of the more verbose descriptions according to settings on the Appearance page.  “Enable key compatibility” means that SSH-1 keys can be used by SSH-2 clients, and vice versa. Support for SSH-1 and SSH-2 client connections is controlled indepen- dently by checkboxes on the Compatibility page.  If “Confirm key operations” is checked, then the agent prompts for each use of the key. “Test private key” requires the agent to verify that the certificate corresponds to the key whenever it is used.  The Compatibility page allows a single key to be loaded automatically when Acces- sion Lite starts. To load an entire collection of keys automatically, use the Key Pro- viders page and add the Software provider. This emulates a smart card by monitoring a specified folder, and automatically adding or deleting keys in the agent as they are created or removed from the folder.  The Log page allows the transaction log that is displayed in the log pane of the main window to be saved to a file.  538    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   By default, all configuration settings are saved automatically; this can be disabled by a setting on the Appearance page. The File Save Configuration menu item is used to manually record configuration changes.  16.5 Advanced Client Use Most of the time, the Tectia GUI applications effectively act as configuration editors, allowing users and administrators to change and save the configuration without wor- rying about the location or format of configuration files. In some other circum- stances, however, an understanding of these details is useful, so we’ll provide a brief guided tour through the internal structure of Tectia’s configuration on Windows.  The system client configuration file ssh2_config is stored in the Tectia client installa- tion folder. This file has the same format and function as the  etc ssh2 ssh2_config file on Unix systems.[7.1.2.2]  Most other parts of the configuration are separately maintained for each user, and are stored in the user profile folder* in the application data subfolder.† Tectia config- uration files are collected in a subfolder named SSH. This folder is analogous to the user configuration folder on Unix systems  typically ~ .ssh2, but ultimately deter- mined by the UserConfigDirectory keyword , although the specific files and folder layout are different for Windows, as we’ll see. [5.3.1.5]  If roaming profiles are used, then the user profile folder is replicated on a server, and files are transmitted to client machines via the net- work, where they can be seen by anyone who is able to sniff traffic en route. To prevent this, either disable roaming profiles for Tectia users, or store the Tectia configuration files in a different, local folder. If the SSHCLIENT_USERPROFILE environment variable is set, its value specifies an alternate location to be used for the Tectia configuration files, instead of the user profile folder.  The Tectia user configuration folder contains:  RandomSeed  HostKeys  A pool of random data. [7.4.18]  A subfolder to store public keys for known hosts. [7.4.3]  * The user profile folder can be determined by examining the value of the USERPROFILE environment variable. It is typically C:\Documents and Settings\username.hostname or  on older systems  C:\WINNT\Profiles\ username.  † The full pathname for the application data folder, including the user profile folder components, can be found  in the value of the APPDATA environment variable. The subfolder is typically named Application Data.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.5 Advanced Client Use    539   A subfolder for storing user identities.  UserKeys  identification  *.ssh2  global.dat  A list of keys used by the command-line client, ssh2.exe. This file can be pro- duced automatically by the GUI client. [16.3] If the identification file is missing, then all keys in the UserKeys folder are used.  Profile settings for the GUI client, which are used to store configuration informa- tion based on the connection target  discussed shortly .  Global settings for the GUI client, which apply to all connections  discussed shortly .  SSH Accession\config.cfg  The configuration settings for Accession Lite, stored in XML format.  The All Users profile folder is conceptually merged with each user profile folder.* Host keys and profile settings can be copied from a user profile folder to the All Users profile folder to provide systemwide access.  The All Users profile folder isn’t available on older platforms such as Windows 98 or Me.  To provide a systemwide default configuration for Accession Lite, copy a suitably crafted config.cfg file from a user profile folder to the Accession Lite installation folder.  Accession Lite doesn’t use the All Users profile folder.  The *.ssh2 files for profile settings and the global.dat configuration file are usually updated by the GUI client  discussed shortly . However, they are ordinary text files that use the venerable DOS *.ini format and are easy to edit directly.  Settings are grouped in sections that are identified by names with square brackets, on separate lines. Each setting is a keyword and value, separated by an equals sign, with one pair per line. Values have prefixes to indicate the type of data:  * The All Users profile folder can be determined by examining the value of the ALLUSERSPROFILE environment variable. It is typically C:\Documents and Settings\All Users or  on older systems  C:\WINNT\Profiles\All Users.  540    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   N:  H:  S:  Decimal number  Hexadecimal number  String  [Security] ... FIPS mode=N:0  Boolean values are represented as decimal numbers, with zero and one indicating false and true, respectively. For example:  Direct editing of these files is required to update a few settings that are not displayed by the GUI client: e.g., the FIPS mode setting. It is also occasionally convenient to use a script to generate a large number of profile setting files that differ only by a few settings.  The files default.ssh2 and defaultsftp.ssh2 contain default settings for the GUI client’s terminal and SFTP modes, respectively. If these files are missing, then hardwired default settings are used.  Profile settings files can be used in several ways:    Double-click on *.ssh2 files in Windows Explorer. This works because the  installer arranges to associate the .ssh2 file suffix with the GUI client.    Create desktop shortcuts to the profile settings files, and then double-click on the desktop icons. The Tectia client installer automatically creates desktop shortcuts for the default profiles using the terminal and SFTP modes.    Click on the Profiles toolbar icon, and then select one of the defined profile set-  tings from the drop-down menu.    Use the File Profiles menu item to present the same drop-down menu.  The drop-down profiles menu also contains items that allow new profiles to be added, and existing profiles to be edited. When new connections are initiated using unsaved profile settings, a dialog is briefly displayed that allows the new profile settings to be added. The Settings toolbar icon or the Edit Settings menu item provides access to the Profile Settings page of the Settings dialog for editing the current profile.  Use the File Save Settings menu item to save the current profile settings, as well as the global settings. The File Save Layout menu item performs the same function, but also records the current position of all the GUI client’s windows.  Profile settings include connection parameters  e.g., the remote hostname, user- name, and port number , encryption and MAC algorithms, authentication methods, optional port forwarding  which is discussed in the next section , and sftp file trans- fer modes.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.5 Advanced Client Use    541   Global settings include key pairs  which we’ve discussed previously: see Figure 16-4 , host keys, other sftp options, and SOCKS firewall specifications.  Except for settings that are related to the appearance or behavior of the GUI client itself, all of the profile and global settings correspond to keywords discussed in Chapter 7.  16.6 Port Forwarding Port forwarding allows Tectia to tunnel TCP connections through multiplexed chan- nels within an existing SSH connection. [9.2] To set up forwarding, use the Tunnel- ing page  Figure 16-7  of the Settings dialog which is accessed by either the Settings toolbar icon or the Edit Settings menu item. Local and remote forwarding  specified by the –L and –R options for the ssh2 command-line client  correspond to outgoing and incoming tunnels, respectively, for the GUI client.  Figure 16-7. Tunneling page  542    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Configure forwarding by first selecting the Outgoing or Incoming tab. Click Add to define settings for a new port forwarding, using a separate dialog  Figure 16-8 , or click Edit to redefine settings for a selected existing forwarding, using a similar dia- log. Click Remove to destroy a selected forwarding.  Figure 16-8. Defining settings for a new port forwarding  Settings for each forwarding include:    A descriptive name, for the displayed list   The port on which to listen, either on the client side  for local forwarding or out- going connections  or on the server side  for remote forwarding or incoming connections     The destination host and port, to which connections should be forwarded on the  opposite side    A checkbox to allow only local connections  only for local forwarding or outgo-  ing connections , which is usually left enabled    The type of forwarding: usually TCP to indicate no special processing, or FTP to create temporary forwarding in the reverse direction for FTP data channels in active mode  Forwarding changes are effective only for the next session, except for removals, which happen immediately.  X forwarding is controlled by a checkbox. This is used with a separate X server run- ning on the same system as the Tectia client.  16.7 Connector We have previously seen how static port forwarding can be extended for SOCKS- aware applications to provide dynamic port forwarding. [9.3] SOCKS is fully sup- ported by the Tectia client, but you have to reconfigure each application to use the SOCKS proxy, which can be annoying.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.7 Connector    543   Tectia Connector extends this concept further to achieve complete transparency: applications can use dynamic port forwarding without any reconfiguration whatso- ever, because the applications are entirely unaware that the forwarding is happening.  To accomplish this feat, Connector worms its way into the Windows TCP IP proto- col stack  which includes hostname lookup functionality . This allows it to intercept networking operations by applications and reroute them to its own Connector engine, which then initiates SSH connections to servers on behalf of the applica- tions. The capture and forward mechanism also allows the Connector engine to exer- cise precise control over network connections, and to enforce security policies that require certain kinds of connections to use secure protocols, like SSH.  As of Version 4.2, Connector requires functionality provided only by “Tectia Server  T .” [16.11] “Tectia Server  A ” can’t be used with Connector, and other non-Tectia servers are unsupported.  Connector only affects outgoing TCP connections. Applications can still accept incoming connections directly, and other protocols  like UDP, ICMP, etc.  are com- pletely ignored by Connector. Note, however, that all applications can be affected by Connector’s interception of hostname lookups.  Connector uses only the SSH-2 protocol, never SSH-1. It is fully self-contained, and does not rely on the Tectia client. Instead, Connector implements the SSH-2 proto- col and initiates its own connections.  The Connector engine starts automatically when each user logs in. If it has been stopped for some reason, it can be restarted manually using the SSH Tectia Connec- tor item from the Start Programs SSH Tectia Connector menu, or by running the SSHConnector program in the Connector installation folder.  In normal operation, Connector is unobtrusive, presenting only a small icon in the tool tray on the taskbar to announce its presence. Right-click the icon to produce a menu that displays a list of applications currently using Connector, a checkbox that allows the Connector engine to be enabled or disabled, and an Exit item that shuts down the Connector engine.  The Connector Status dialog can be displayed by double-clicking the tool tray icon or selecting the Status item from the tool tray icon menu. The Tunnels view shows each forwarded port, with the program using the connection, the destination server, and usage statistics  data sent and received . The Logs view displays messages  with timestamps  about authentication, creation of forwarded ports, connections by applications, etc. The Connector engine maintains its own log; it doesn’t send mes- sages to the Windows event log.  Privileged users can use the Administration dialog or edit the configuration file directly to configure the Connector engine. The administrative GUI interface is  544    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   accessed by selecting the SSH Tectia Connector Admin item from the Start  Programs SSH Tectia Connector menu, or a similar item in the Connector tool tray icon menu, or by running the SSHConnectorAdmin program in the Connector instal- lation folder.  16.7.1 General Settings The Connector engine itself is configured by the General Settings view of the Admin- istration dialog  Figure 16-9 , which applies to all outgoing connections.  Figure 16-9. Configuring the Connector engine  Sometimes it is necessary or convenient to bypass Connector and allow applications to initiate their own connections directly: this is known as pass-through mode. An option is provided to allow pass-through if the engine is disabled or shut down. If this pass-through option is disabled, then connections will be blocked, which might be appropriate if security policies mandate that only secure connections are allowed. A comma-separated list of applications can also be exempted from interference by  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.7 Connector    545   Connector. Typically these applications are for network diagnostics  e.g., nslookup or ping  or related to direct use of SSH  e.g., the Tectia client, Accession Lite, etc. .  Applications frequently need to connect to secure servers within internal networks from outside of firewalls. External hostname lookups are commonly prevented, to avoid leaking information about the internal network, and because direct access to the secure servers is blocked by the firewall anyway. In such cases, Connector can be configured to return dynamically assigned pseudo  or fake  IP addresses to applica- tions in response to hostname lookups. When the connection is forwarded across the firewall via SSH, the hostname lookup is done internally. This is similar to the nam- ing support provided by SOCKS5.  A base address must be identified for the pseudo IP addresses. This should be cho- sen carefully to avoid conflicts with real addresses of machines that applications might need to contact. It is natural to use reserved addresses  e.g., the 10.0.0.0 8 net- work  for this purpose, but if applications detect the use of such reserved addresses and misbehave, then it may be necessary to use a suitable range of otherwise unused real addresses.  As we have seen, Connector works by modifying the Windows TCP IP protocol stack. Other, unrelated packages that also modify the protocol stack  such as fire- walls and VPN software  can interfere with the operation of Connector, and require that Connector’s protocol stack modifications be reinstalled, which in turn requires a reboot. An option is provided to automate this; no user confirmation is needed.  Connector’s SSH implementation supports FIPS mode, which can be selected by an option. [5.3.5]  In most cases, Connector operates silently, and behind the scenes. However, SSH servers can be configured to send banner messages to clients, and Connector has an option for displaying them. [5.6.1] In addition, Connector can display a splash screen as a brief security notification when new forwarded connections are created for applications.  The tray icon menu can be configured to control access to functions that affect the engine, to prevent unprivileged users from circumventing security policies. Of course, the Connector configuration file should only be writable by privileged users.  Servers for Outgoing SSH Connections  16.7.2 Settings for each server used for an outgoing SSH connection must be defined by the Servers view of the Administration dialog in Figure 16-10.  A display name is assigned to the collection of settings for the server. Connections to a server can be routed via a previously defined server, to set up chains of port for- wardings, if required for nested firewalls.  546    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Figure 16-10. Defining settings for outgoing SSH connections  The most important characteristics of the SSH connection can be specified for the server. The special token %USERNAME% means that the local Windows username is used for the remote username as well.  By default, Connector initiates SSH connections only when required to forward con- nections from applications, but an option is provided to initiate the connection when the Connector engine starts. Idle SSH connections are terminated by Connector after a specified timeout interval elapses.* Normally, SSH connections are retained  even when idle  if any forwarding channels are still active, but Connector can be config- ured to ignore active channels when it closes idle connections.  The allowed authentication methods are specified as a comma-separated list, chosen from the set: gssapi-with-mic, publickey, keyboard-interactive, and password. Public-key authentication is especially convenient with Accession Lite acting as an authentication agent. [16.4] Accession Lite is included with the Tectia Connector pack-  * The timeout interval is expressed as a number of seconds.

A predefined response can be stored in the Connector configuration for password authentication. This is insecure, since the password saved in the configuration file is not encrypted in any way, and the predefined response is intended only for situations when the applica- tion handles its own authentication using some other secure mechanism.  A proxy server URL can be specified using the same syntax as for the Tectia client’s SocksServer keyword or the SSH_SOCKS_SERVER environment variable. [7.4.7.2] HTTP forwarding is also supported, using a similar syntax. SOCKS4 is used by default, but an option is provided to use SOCKS5 instead.  A filename should be chosen to store the host key for the server. The key can be fetched automatically by the Connector administration program, but the fingerprint should be verified using ssh-keygen -F. [6.2.2] Host keys are commonly stored in the All Users profile folder.  Filter Rules for Dynamic Port Forwarding  16.7.3 The Connector engine consults a list of filter rules to decide how to forward outgo- ing connections by applications. These are configured by the Filters view of the Administration dialog in Figure 16-11.  A display name is assigned to each filter rule. The filter rules are matched according to the DNS hostname or IP address requested by an application, and the first match- ing filter rule is used for the connection. DNS hostnames and IP addresses can be specified either literally or as patterns using the egrep regular expression syntax. DNS hostnames are case-insensitive.  In the usual case when an application connects using a DNS hostname, Connector scans the filter rule list. If a hostname match is found, then the first matching filter rule is used. The IP address returned to the application is taken from the filter rule if one is specified, or is otherwise dynamically assigned from the pool of pseudo IP addresses.* If no matching filter rule is found, then the connection is initiated directly, with no port forwarding.  When an application connects using an IP address, Connector similarly scans the fil- ter rule list, looking for a filter rule with a matching address, and uses the first filter rule that is found. Otherwise, if there is no matching filter rule, then Connector does a reverse hostname lookup using the IP address. If this lookup succeeds, then Con- nector performs a DNS hostname match, as described previously. Otherwise, if the reverse hostname lookup failed, then Connector blocks the connection. Any host- name specified for the filter rule is passed to the other side of the forwarded connec- tion so that the server can perform the hostname lookup for the real IP address on an internal network.  * If pseudo IP addresses are disabled in the General Settings, then the actual IP address of the server is used.  548    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Filter rules for forwarding outgoing connections  Connections are forwarded based on the target port requested by the application, according to a list of connection rules for each filter rule. Each connection rule con- sists of a comma-separated list of ports, or the special value All, plus one of the fol- lowing actions:  DIRECT  BLOCK  server  Initiate a connection directly, without port forwarding.  Block the connection, so the application will see the error “connection refused.”  Initiate an SSH connection, according to the settings for the named server.  The first matching connection rule for the requested port is used. If no connection rule matches, then a direct connection is initiated.  Connections are also forwarded according to the full pathname for the application. The Connector administrative interface allows the specification of only a single application. This restriction was imposed as of Version 4.2, and is actually a  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Earlier versions of SSHConnectorAdmin allowed the speci- fication of an application for each filter rule.*  Conﬁguration File  16.7.4 The Connector engine uses the configuration file sshcorpoeng.cfg in the installation folder. The Connector administration program saves its settings in the configuration file automatically, and is the usual way to change the configuration.  However, the configuration file uses a straightforward format and is easy to edit directly. Settings are grouped in hierarchical sections that are delimited by curly braces. Each setting is a keyword and value, separated by an equals sign, with one pair per line. Values are Boolean  FALSE or TRUE , decimal numbers, or quoted strings, which use C-language conventions for backslash escape sequences. This convention is unfortunate, because all backslashes for Windows filename separators must be doubled.  Some features can only be used by editing the configuration file, and are not avail- able via the GUI-based administrative interface. For example, the filter rules shown in Figure 16-11 correspond to the configure file section:  Filters = {   secure_mail = {     DNSNameRegexp = ".*\\.mail\\.example\\.com$"     Application = "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WhizBangMail\\\\MailClient\\.exe"     RealIP = FALSE     Connections = {       connection1 = {         Via = "mail"         Port = "25,143"       }       connection2 = {         Via = "DIRECT"         Port = "0-65536"       }     }   } }  Regular expressions or literal values can be selected independently for DNS host- names and IP addresses by using any combination of the following keywords:    DNSNameRegexp   DNSName   IPAddressRegexp   IPAddress  * You can specify multiple applications if you use Tectia Manager to configure Connector. The restriction also  does not apply if you edit the configuration file directly.  550    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The RealIP keyword controls assignment of pseudo IP addresses for each rule.  A separate application can be specified for each filter rule. The application path- name is actually a pattern, using the egrep regular expression syntax. The combina- tion of C-language conventions for strings and regular expressions leads to an abundance of backslashes. For the setting:  Application = "C:\\\\Program Files\\\\WhizBangMail\\\\MailClient\\.exe"  the C-language string corresponds  collapsing the doubled backslashes  to the regu- lar expression:  C:\\Program Files\\WhizBangMail\\MailClient\.exe  which matches the pathname:  C:\Program Files\WhizBangMail\MailClient.exe  16.8 File Transfers The Tectia client supports file transfers using sftp. The File Transfer window  Figure 16-12  for the GUI client is obtained by using the New File Transfer Win- dow toolbar icon or the Window New File Transfer menu item, and operates simi- larly to Windows Explorer.  To transfer files, use any of the following methods:    Simply drag and drop files or folders between the Local and Remote views.   Select the files or folders to be transferred in the Local or Remote views, and  then click the download or upload icons in the toolbar.    Right-click on a file or folder in the Local or Remote view to produce a menu, and then use the Upload or Download menu items. If the Upload Dialog or Download Dialog menu items are used instead, then a separate dialog allows selection of files to be transferred.    Select the files or folders to be transferred in the Local or Remote views, and  then use the same menu items in the Operation menu.  Most other file operations can be performed within the Local or Remote views using the Operation menu, or familiar Windows Explorer gestures. These include opening files, running programs, deleting or renaming files and folders, creating new folders, etc. Some restrictions on the operations may be imposed by the remote system.  The sftp file transfer mode can be set to ASCII, Binary, or Auto Select using icons on the toolbar, or the Operation File Transfer Mode menu items.  The transfer view at the bottom of the window shows progress information and sta- tistics for each transfer.

File transfer window  16.9 Command-Line Programs The GUI client can be launched from the command line. This is useful for creating customized shortcuts, or other wrapper scripts  e.g., *.bat files .  The program is named SSHClient, and supports the following options:*  -r  Reset all customizations made to the user interface  toolbars and menus . The client asks for confirmation before doing this.  -u [username]  Specify the remote username.  * Options can also be specified with a forward slash instead of a hyphen: e.g.,  f or -f.  552    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Specify the remote hostname  where the SSH server runs .  -h [hostname]  -p [port]  -f  Specify the port number.  Start using the file-transfer window instead of the terminal window.  A profile settings file  *.ssh2  can also be specified as the last argument on the com- mand line.  The GUI client immediately initiates an outgoing connection if any of the –u, –h, or –p options, or a profile settings file, are specified. If no remote hostname is given  either by the –h option or a profile settings file , then the client prompts for con- nection parameters, with any other supplied values as defaults. Otherwise, the cli- ent starts in an unconnected state and waits for outgoing connections to be initiated manually.  The precedence for settings is  from strongest to weakest :  1. Command-line options 2. A profile settings file specified on the command line 3. Default profile settings files: either default.ssh2 or defaultsftp.ssh2  if the -f option  is used   4. Hardwired default settings, if the default profile settings files do not exist  The Tectia Client package also supplies a set of command-line programs, including ssh2, scp2, sftp2, and ssh-keygen2.* These programs are intended for scripting, and function almost exactly as they do for Unix implementations, except that they are aware of the Windows conventions for configuration file locations. In fact, ssh2 -h is an easy way to list the location of the configuration files for the client  in the user profile folder . The programs understand both Windows and Unix filename conven- tions using backslashes and  forward  slashes, respectively. Wildcards are case-insen- sitive, in accordance with Windows filesystem conventions.  Command-line variants for ssh-agent2 or ssh-add2 are notably absent. This functionality is provided only by Accession Lite. The command- line client program  ssh2  uses Accession Lite to contact an agent for authentication.  * Note that all of the program names end with the “2” suffix. Corresponding program names without “2” are  not provided, as they are  via symbolic links  on Unix systems.

The Troubleshooting dialog  Figure 16-13  displays a collection of useful informa- tion, including:    Local client version   License details   Operating system   Remote server version   Algorithms used   Connection settings   Error messages  Figure 16-13. The Troubleshooting dialog  The Debugging dialog  Figure 16-14  collects diagnostic output messages from the client. A checkbox enables or disables debugging.

A checkbox allows the log file to be automatically cleared when the client starts; it can also be cleared manually at any time using the Clear File button.  Figure 16-14. The Debugging dialog  16.11 Server Two distinct flavors of the Tectia server are available  as of Version 4.2 . The full-fea- tured Tectia Server  T  is intended for application tunneling, and supports extra functionality needed by Tectia Connector, while the slightly encumbered Tectia Server  A  is intended only for remote system administration. All the programs that make up these products are identical; the only difference is the license file that enables or disables the additional features.  * Verbose log levels cause the client to run more slowly.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.11 Server    555   16.11.1 Server Operation The Tectia server is implemented by a program, ssh2master, that runs as a daemon and listens for incoming connections. A separate program, ssh2server, is run to han- dle each connection when it is accepted. The sftp server is implemented by the pro- gram sftp_server2.  If you run a Tectia server on a Windows system configured with a fire- wall, be sure to allow access to the port s  used to accept SSH connec- tions, typically port 22.  Stopping the ssh2master program doesn’t affect existing connections, since ssh2server continues to run. The Tectia server can even be restarted by a session that uses an SSH connection!  Normally, the Tectia server is run as a Windows service that is automatically started whenever the system boots. Several mechanisms can be used to start or stop the ser- vice manually:    Use the Tectia server administration program  discussed shortly .   Select either the Start Server or Stop Server item within the menu Start   Programs SSH Tectia Server Tools.    Access the Control Panel, and use the dialogs for Administrative Tools Services to select the display name SSH Tectia Server, and then click Start, Stop, or Restart the service.    Run the start-ssh.bat or stop-ssh.bat scripts in the installation folder.   Start or stop the service using the command net start SSHSecureShell2Server or  net stop SSHSecureShell2Server, respectively.    Run ssh2master -start or ssh2master -stop.  ssh2master also understands the options –install and –remove to add or delete the Tectia server from the list of Windows services.  In addition, ssh2master accepts a few options that we have discussed previously for sshd2 on Unix platforms:  -p port  -f config-file  -d level  Listen to the specified port. [5.3.3.1]  Use an alternate server configuration file. [5.2.1]  Run in debug mode, and specify the debug level. [5.9.2]  556    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   16.11.2 Server Conﬁguration The server’s configuration files are stored in the installation folder  nothing is stored in the Windows registry :  hostkey  Private host key  must be protected!   hostkey.pub  Public host key server_random_seed  Pool of random data  sshd2_config  Server configuration  sshd2_config has the same format as for Unix systems, and almost all of the key- words have exactly the same meaning for Windows, so we’ll just discuss the differ- ences.  The server administration program, ssh2admin, also known as the Server Configura- tion tool  Figure 16-15 , can display and change some keywords, but many features can be customized only by editing the file.  ssh2admin can be either run directly, or accessed by selecting the SSH Tectia Server Administration item within the menu Start Programs SSH Tectia Server. The Tools  View Configuration item displays the sshd2_config file in the Notepad editor.  Configuration changes take effect for each new session, as they are read by ssh2server. Only a few configuration keywords are used by ssh2master. If any of these are changed, the service should be restarted:    Port   ListenAddress   MaxConnections  FIPSMode    yes  FIPS mode is controlled by the FIPSmode keyword, with a value of yes or no  the default : [5.3.5]  16.11.3 Commands and Interactive Sessions When a command has been specified by an SSH client, it is run directly by the Tectia server. For commands that are built into the Windows command interpreter cmd.exe, specify cmd explicitly for the ssh command:  $ ssh winserver.example.com cmd  c type readme.txt  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.11 Server    557   Figure 16-15. Server configuration with ssh2admin  Otherwise, if no command is given, then the server runs cmd.exe by default for the interactive session. An alternate program can be specified by the TerminalProvider keyword:   Tectia TerminalProvider    "some-other-cmd.exe"  This provides the same functionality as the login shell for Unix systems, except that it applies to all users. User-specific subconfiguration files can specify different pro- grams for individual users. [11.6.2]  Users can run graphical applications from SSH sessions, but the applications have no access to the display, so this has limited usefulness. Full-screen text applications don’t work correctly, because they expect to run in a real console window, and the SSH connection doesn’t provide information about the window dimensions, etc.  By default, the Tectia server creates terminals for interactive sessions in a fully pri- vate window station. This is controlled by the PrivateWindowStation keyword:   Tectia PrivateWindowStation    yes  558    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   The DoubleBackSpace keyword copes with Japanese Windows systems, which require double backspaces to be sent by the server in response to single backspaces from the client, for each two-byte Japanese character. The value is either yes  to enable this behavior  or no  the default :   Tectia DoubleBackSpace     yes  Child processes that are launched from SSH sessions are not automatically termi- nated when the session ends. This could be construed as a bug or a feature, depend- ing on the circumstances: beware.  The user profile folder is used as the home folder for commands and interactive sessions.  16.11.4 Authentication Windows passwords are used for password authentication. The password authenti- cation method is always required for domain user accounts. Public-key authentica- tion works only for local user accounts, not domain user accounts.  The %D pattern for the UserConfigDirectory keyword refers to the user profile folder. [5.3.1.5] The user configuration folder contains the authorization file and public keys.  The default value for UserConfigDirectory is %D .ssh2, which works and is consistent with the Unix location. However, it is strange from a Windows perspective, and different from all of the other Tectia pro- grams, which use the Application Data\SSH subfolder within the user profile folder.  16.11.5 Access Control Accounts that use the SSH server for logins must possess the right to “log on locally.” This is disabled by default on some servers, such as domain controllers. Keywords like PermitRootLogin that refer to the Unix superuser affect any Windows accounts with administrative privileges.  In the server configuration, domain user accounts should be specified as domain  user  with a forward slash . The usual Windows backslash separator cannot be used.  Windows groups are not supported by the server, so keywords and values that refer to groups must not appear in the configuration files.

All rights reserved.  16.11 Server    559   16.11.6 Forwarding The Tectia server supports only TCP port forwarding on Windows, and enforces the restriction that only privileged users can use privileged port numbers  less than 1024 .* X forwarding and agent forwarding are not supported.  16.11.7 SFTP Server To support SFTP, the Tectia server configuration must include the sftp subsystem definition:  Subsystem-sftp      "sftp_server2.exe"  No internal implementation is built into the SSH server, as it is for the Tectia servers on Unix systems.  The SFTP server restricts access to a set of folders. This is controlled by the Sftp- DirList keyword:   Tectia Sftp-DirList    "HOME=%D, SCRATCH=S:\scratch\%U"  The value is a comma-separated list  with optional whitespace , where each element has the format virtual=real. Virtual folder names are arbitrary, and are presented to the SFTP clients. These are mapped to the specified real folders on the server. The folder names can contain the patterns %D and %U, representing the user profile folder and the username, respectively. The default value is HOME=%D.  A set of administrative  or power  users can be defined to use an alternate list of folders:   Tectia Sftp-AdminUsers     "administrator, backup.*, rebecca" Sftp-AdminDirList   "HOME=%D, BACKUP=Z:\backup, C:=C:, D:=D:"  The value for Sftp-AdminUsers is a comma-separated list  with optional whitespace  of username patterns. By default, only the administrator account is included.  The Sftp-AdminDirList value has the same format as for Sftp-DirList. The default is HOME=%D, C:=C:, D:=D:.  SFTP sessions start in a home folder, which is specified by the Sftp-Home keyword:   Tectia Sftp-Home           "S:\sftp\%U"  The SFTP home folder must be accessible, according to Sftp-DirList or Sftp- AdminDirList. The folder can use the same patterns, %D and %U. The default is %D  the user profile folder .  * Windows does not normally distinguish privileged ports from higher-numbered ports.  560    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   16.11.8 Logging and Debugging The server records log messages in the Windows event log, instead of using the stan- dards syslog service found on Unix systems. The event log can be viewed using the Tectia server administration program, or using the Control Panel, by selecting Administrative Tools Event Viewer.  The verbosity of the messages is controlled by the EventLogFilter keyword:   Tectia EventLogFilter      error, warning  Values are a comma-separated list  with optional whitespace  consisting of one or more of the following levels:  error  warning  Serious problems that prevent operations from completing  Problems that allow operations to continue  information  Normal, successful events  Note that the higher levels do not include the lower levels, as they do for syslog on Unix systems. Each Windows event log level must be specified explicitly.  The SFTP server’s SftpLogCategory, that specifies the kinds of messages that are sent to the event log:  controlled by a separate keyword,  log messages are   Tectia SftpLogCategory     31  The numeric value is the sum of any of the following:    16 = user login logout  the default    8 = folder listings   4 = modifications   2 = uploads   1 = downloads  The ssh2admin program provides more convenient checkboxes to specify the value for SftpLogCategory.  The ssh2master -d option works the same way as it does for sshd2 on Unix systems to enable debug mode and specify the debug log level: [5.9.2]   Tectia ssh2master -d4  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  16.11 Server    561   Debug output is written to the console window by default, but this can be redirected to a file:   Tectia ssh2master -d4 2> debug.txt  The scripts debug-ssh.bat and debug-ssh-file.bat run ssh2master with debug level 4, as shown earlier. In addition, the debug-ssh-file.bat script redirects output to the file sshd2_debug_output.txt in the installation folder, and then displays the file in the Notepad editor after the server exits. These scripts can also be run by selecting the items Troubleshoot Server or Troubleshoot Server and Save Debug Output from the menu Start Programs SSH Tectia Server Tools.  562    Chapter 16: Tectia for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Chapter 17  CHAPTER 17 SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  SecureCRT, created by VanDyke Software, is a commercial SSH client for Microsoft Windows 95 through Windows 2003. It is structured as a terminal program; in fact, it started life as the terminal program CRT, another VanDyke product. As a result, SecureCRT’s terminal capabilities are quite configurable. It includes emulation of several terminal types, logins via Telnet as well as SSH, a scripting language, a key- map editor, SOCKS firewall support, chat features, and much more. We will focus only on its SSH capabilities, however.  SecureCRT supports both SSH-1 and SSH-2 in a single program. Other important features include port forwarding, X11 packet forwarding, support for multiple SSH identities, and an agent. Secure file copy is accomplished not only by an scp-type pro- gram, vcp, but also by ZModem, an old protocol for uploading and downloading files.  The remote machine must have ZModem installed.  If ZModem is used while you’re logged in via SSH, these file transfers are secure.  We’ve organized this chapter to mirror the first part of the book covering Unix SSH implementations. When appropriate, we refer you to the earlier material for more detailed information.  Our discussion of SecureCRT is based on a prerelease of Version 5.0, dated Decem- ber 2004.  17.1 Obtaining and Installing SecureCRT may be purchased and downloaded from VanDyke Software:  http:  www.vandyke.com   A free evaluation version is available, expiring 30 days after installation, so you can try before you buy. If you do purchase the program, VanDyke will provide a serial number and license key.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  563   Installation is straightforward and glitch-free. The software is distributed as a sin- gle .exe file; simply run it to install the program. Follow the onscreen instructions, installing the software in any folder you like. We accepted the default choices.  17.2 Basic Client Use Once you’ve installed the program, it’s time to set up a new session, which is Secure- CRT’s word for a collection of settings. Choose “Quick Connect...” from the File menu, and in the window that appears  see Figure 17-1 , enter the following information:  Select ssh2 for the SSH-2 protocol.  Protocol  Hostname  Port  Enter the hostname of the remote SSH server, such as server.example.com.  Leave it at the default port number, 22, unless your server uses a nonstandard port. Username  Enter your username on the remote machine.  Authentication  Select Password, unless you have another method set up already.  Also put a checkmark in the “Save session” checkbox if you plan to return to this SSH server regularly.  Now click the Connect button. You should be prompted for your login password on the remote machine, and then you’ll be logged in via SSH. SecureCRT operates just like a normal terminal program. SSH’s end-to-end encryption is transparent to the user, as it should be.  17.3 Key Management SecureCRT supports public-key authentication using DSA or RSA keys. It can gener- ate keys with a built-in wizard  in SECSH format, compatible with Tectia [6.1.2] , or you can import existing keys. It also distinguishes between two different types of SSH identities: global and session-specific. Finally, SecureCRT includes an SSH agent and supports OpenSSH-style agent forwarding.  564    Chapter 17: SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Figure 17-1. SecureCRT Quick Connect window  17.3.1 Key Generation Wizard SecureCRT’s Key Generation Wizard creates key pairs for public-key authentication. The utility is run in the Tools menu by selecting Create Public Key. Equivalently, from the Global Options window, under SSH2 or SSH1,* click Create Identity File.  Operation is straightforward. All you need to supply are the passphrase, the number of bits in the key, and some random data by moving your mouse around the screen. The RSA Key Generation Wizard then creates a key pair and stores it in two files. As with the Unix SSH implementations, the private key filename is anything you choose  say, mykey , and its corresponding public-key filename is the same with .pub added  e.g., mykey.pub .  Once your key pair is generated, you need to copy the public key to the SSH server machine, storing it in your account’s authorization file. [6.1] SecureCRT can do this automatically, or you can do it manually.  17.3.1.1 Automatic installation of keys SecureCRT can upload your public keys to an SSH server with the click of a button, but there’s a catch: your remote SSH server must support the publickey subsystem, described in technical detail at:  http:  www.vandyke.com technology draft-ietf-secsh-publickey-subsystem.txt  * VanDyke uses the terms “SSH1” and “SSH2” to mean the protocols SSH-1 and SSH-2, respectively.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  17.3 Key Management    565   VanDyke’s own VShell server supports it, and VanDyke makes available a patched OpenSSH server with similar support at:  http:  www.vandyke.com download os pks_ossh.html  Assuming you’re running one of these servers:  1. Open the Session Options window, either for an existing session or to create a  new session.  Figure 17-2 .  2. Under Connection SSH2, fill in your desired hostname and remote username.  Then, for your primary authentication method, choose PublicKey.  3. Click the Properties button to display the Public Key Properties dialog  see  4. Select your desired public key, or generate a new one. 5. Click the Upload button. 6. SecureCRT will upload your public key to the remote SSH server machine. You  will have to authenticate.  Figure 17-2. SecureCRT Public Key Properties dialog  If the server does not support the publickey subsystem, you’ll see an error message like “Unable to open the subsystem for publickey assistant.” Try installing the key manually.  17.3.1.2 Manual installation of keys To install your SecureCRT public key on a remote SSH server:  1. Log into the SSH server machine using SecureCRT and password authentication. 2. View the public-key file and copy the full text of the key to the Windows  clipboard.  566    Chapter 17: SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   3. Install the public key  by pasting from the clipboard as necessary  on the SSH  server machine in your remote account. [2.4.3]  4. Log out. 5. In the Session Options window, select Connection SSH2, and change Authenti-  cation from Password to PublicKey.  6. Log in again. SecureCRT prompts you for your private-key passphrase, and  you’ll be logged in.  17.3.2 Using Multiple Identities SecureCRT supports two types of SSH identities. Your global identity is the default for all SecureCRT sessions, and is found on the Global Options window, under SSH2 or SSH1  “Use identity file” .  You may override the default by using a session-specific identity that may differ  as the name implies  for each session you define:  1. Open the Session Options window. 2. Select Connection SSH2. 3. For your primary authentication type, select PublicKey, then click the Properties  button to its right, to view the Public Key Properties dialog  see Figure 17-2 .  4. Select “Use session public key setting,” then select or generate your key of  choice.  The SSH Agent  17.3.3 SecureCRT comes with an SSH agent for holding your SSH keys in memory, so you don’t have to type your passphrase.  We cover agents in Chapter 6.   SecureCRT’s agent is the simplest to use of any SSH implementation we’ve seen. Simply open the Global Options window, select SSH2, and place a checkmark next to “Add keys to agent.” From that point onward, each time you enter a passphrase for a key, the decrypted key will be stored in the agent, so you won’t have to reenter the passphrase.  To enable SecureCRT’s agent forwarding, which works with OpenSSH and VanDyke’s own VShell servers only, open the Global Options window and select SSH2. Then place a checkmark next to “Enable OpenSSH agent forwarding.” [6.3.5]  You might also notice that SecureCRT offers to remember login passwords when you use password authentication. This is not the same as using an agent: your login pass- word on the remote machine has nothing to do with keys and passphrases on the local machine.

All rights reserved.  17.3 Key Management    567   17.4 Advanced Client Use SecureCRT lets you change settings for its SSH features and its terminal features. We will cover only the SSH-related ones. The others  and more details on the SSH fea- tures  are found in SecureCRT’s online help.  SecureCRT calls a set of configuration parameters a session. It also distinguishes between session options that affect only the current session and global options that affect all sessions.  You can change session options before starting an SSH connection or while you are connected. Some options can’t be changed while connected, naturally, such as the name of the remote SSH server machine.

Name  Protocol  Hostname  Port  Username  17.4.1 Mandatory Fields To establish any SSH connection, fill in the Connection fields in the Session Options window. These include:  A memorable name for your collection of settings. This can be anything, but it defaults to the name of the SSH server.  Either SSH-1 or SSH-2.  Then fill in the following fields under Connection SSH2:  The name of the remote SSH server machine to which you want to connect.  The TCP port for SSH connections. Virtually all SSH clients and servers operate on port 22. Unless you plan to connect to a nonstandard SSH server, you won’t need to change this. [7.4.5.1]  Your username on the remote SSH server machine. If you’re using public-key authentication, this username must belong to an account that contains your public key. Authentication  How you identify yourself to the SSH server. This can be password  i.e., your remote login password , public key, keyboard-interactive authentication  a.k.a. challenge-response or one-time password , or GSSAPI authentication. [5.4]  17.4.2 Data Compression SecureCRT can transparently compress and uncompress the data traveling over an SSH connection. This can speed up your connection. [7.4.14]  In the Session Options window, choose Connection SSH2 Advanced. The “Com- pression” dropdown lets you select the type of compression  zlib is the most stan- dard . You may also set a value for the compression Level. The higher the value, the better the compression, but the greater load on the CPU, potentially slowing your computer.  Firewall Use  17.4.3 SecureCRT supports connections through several types of firewalls, such as the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 firewalls supported by various SSH servers. You can config- ure one or more named firewalls and select one to be the default for all new sessions.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  17.4 Advanced Client Use    569   Every individual session can use any of the named firewalls. You need to know the hostname or IP address of the firewall, and the TCP port on which to connect.  17.5 Forwarding SecureCRT supports the SSH feature called forwarding  Chapter 9 , in which another network connection can be passed through SSH to encrypt it. It is also called tunneling because the SSH connection provides a secure “tunnel” through which another connection may pass. Both TCP port forwarding and X forwarding are sup- ported.  As well as agent forwarding, as we mentioned earlier.   17.5.1 Port Forwarding Port forwarding permits an arbitrary TCP connection to be routed through an SSH connection, transparently encrypting its data. [9.2] This turns an insecure TCP con- nection, such as Telnet, IMAP, or NNTP  Usenet news , into a secure one. Secure- CRT supports local SSH client  SecureCRT  forwards the connection to a remote SSH server.  forwarding, meaning that your  local port  Each SecureCRT session you create may have different port forwardings set up. To set up forwarding to a particular remote host, open the Session Options window and select Connection Port Forwarding.  To create a new forwarding, first click the Add button to display the Local Port For- warding Properties window, as in Figure 17-4. Then enter:  Name  Local  Remote  Any descriptive name for your forwarding, to help you remember what it does.  The port number on your local machine to connect to the secure tunnel. This can be just about any number, but for tradition’s sake, make it 1024 or higher. Choose a local port number that’s not being used by any other SSH client on your PC. If you want to restrict the local IP address that allows connections  i.e., if your PC has multiple network addresses , check the associated checkbox  “Manually select local IP addresses...”  and fill in the address.  The port number of the remote service, such as 119 for NNTP or 143 for IMAP. The remote machine, by default, is the same one used for your SecureCRT ses- sion, but you can change this by checking “Destination host is different from the SSH server” and entering the hostname where the remote service is found. But beware: you can produce a non-secured tunnel with this kind of third-party for- warding if you’re not careful.  570    Chapter 17: SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Application  SecureCRT can run an external program for you to take part in the forwarding. For example, if you’re forwarding to an IMAP mail server, SecureCRT could launch your mail client. If you want this behavior, enter the path to your desired application program.  When you’re done, click OK to save the forwarding, and your desired TCP port will be forwarded for the duration of your connection.  Figure 17-4. Local Port Forwarding properties window  X Forwarding  17.5.2 The X Window System is the most popular windowing software for Unix machines. If you want to run remote X clients that open windows on your PC, you need:    A remote host, running an SSH server, that has X client programs available   An X server running on your PC under Windows, such as Cygwin X or X-  SecurePro  SSH makes your X connection secure by a process called X forwarding. [9.4] Turn- ing on X forwarding is trivial in SecureCRT. Simply put a checkmark in the checkbox  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  17.5 Forwarding    571   “Forward X11 Packets.” It is found in the Session Options window under Connec- tion Port Forwarding X11.  To secure an X connection by forwarding it through SSH, first run SecureCRT and establish a secure terminal connection to the SSH server machine, with X forwarding enabled. Then run your PC’s X server, disabling its login features such as XDM. Now simply invoke X clients on the server machine.  17.6 Command-Line Client Programs Although SecureCRT is a graphical terminal program, it also comes with a few com- mand-line programs very similar to the ssh, scp, and sftp programs supplied with OpenSSH and Tectia. They are called vsh, vcp, and vsftp.  vsh is a remote login and command-execution program similar to ssh. Type vsh by itself for full usage information. Here are some notable examples:   Log into server.example.com as smith C:\> vsh -l smith server.example.com   Invoke the remote command "who" C:\> vsh -l smith server.example.com who  vcp is a file-transfer program similar to scp: we discuss it in the next section. vsftp is an interactive file-transfer program similar to sftp and ftp.  17.7 File Transfer SecureCRT offers three ways to transfer files securely between systems via SSH:    vcp and vsftp   Xmodem or Zmodem   SecureFX  The vcp and vsftp Commands  17.7.1 SecureCRT comes with a command-line program, vcp, for transferring files securely. It has syntax almost identical to scp. For example, to copy the local file myfile to the remote SSH server server.example.com, authenticating as smith, and naming the copy newfile:  C:\> vcp myfile smith@server.example.com:newfile  Many of vcp’s options are the same as scp’s:  -r -i -v  Recursive copy Specify a public-key identity for authentication Verbose flag for debugging  572    Chapter 17: SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   However, other options are different. Type vcp by itself for full usage information.  vsftp is an FTP-like client provided with SecureCRT; it should feel familiar to any- one who has used an FTP client. Run vsftp -h for full usage information.  Zmodem File Transfer  17.7.2 SecureCRT supports file transfer using the old Xmodem and Zmodem protocols, secured via SSH. To use these protocols, your SSH server machine will need Xmo- dem or Zmodem programs installed, such as sz and rz  send and receive Zmodem, respectively  or sx and rx  send and receive Xmodem, respectively , often found on Linux machines. For example, to send a file from the remote server machine to your local client machine via Zmodem:  2. SecureCRT will automatically detect the Zmodem connection and perform the  download, displaying the file-transfer status in a window.  1. On the remote system, run:  $ sz myfile  Similarly, to upload a file:  1. On the remote system, run:  $ rz  2. In SecureCRT, choose Transfer Zmodem Upload List, and select the files you  want to transfer. Then select Transfer Start Zmodem Upload.  SecureFX  17.7.3 If you want a graphical file transfer with a Windows Explorer-like interface, plus integration with SecureCRT, consider VanDyke’s commercial product, SecureFX. Once you’ve authenticated and connected to a remote SSH server, you can drag and drop files between the machines with your mouse.  SecureFX also has an interesting feature called Quick Synchronize, which is roughly similar to hotsynching on a Palm Pilot. Suppose you have a set of files on your local computer and a backup copy on a remote system. The Quick Synchronize feature compares the two sets, displays the differences, and lets you make them identical by copying files securely between the two systems. Even if you’ve edited the files on both systems, Quick Synchronize can bring both sets up to date with the most recent changes.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  17.7 File Transfer    573   17.8 Troubleshooting SecureCRT, like any other SSH client, can run into unexpected difficulties interact- ing with an SSH server. In this section we cover problems specific to SecureCRT. For more general problems, see also Chapter 12.  17.8.1 Authentication Q: When I try to upload my public key, I get the message, “Unable to open publickey  A:  subsystem” and the upload fails. SecureCRT can upload public keys only to SSH servers supporting the public- key subsystem, an open standard created by VanDyke. If you get this message, your remote server doesn’t have this support.  Forwarding  I can’t do port forwarding. I get a message that the port is already in use.  17.8.2 Q: A: Do you have another SecureCRT window open and connected with the same port-forwarding setup? You can’t have two connections forwarding the same local port. As a workaround, create a second session that duplicates the first, but with a different local port number. Now you can use both sessions simulta- neously.  17.9 VShell VanDyke Software also sells an SSH server product, VShell, that runs on Windows and various Unix platforms, including Red Hat Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OS X, and HP-UX. VShell has interesting features to recommend it:  File and notification triggers  Flexible SFTP configuration  VShell can execute arbitrary commands in response to events such as SFTP file transfers or failed authentication attempts.  VShell’s SFTP server has an access control list  ACL  language that can assign access to individual server directories by any combination of account name or group membership. It can conveniently use the Unix chroot mechanism to restrict users to given directories, as well as define virtual directories that hide details of server file organization from clients.  Fine-grained access control  Again using ACLs, the VShell server can restrict access to services by individual accounts. One account might be allowed full access while another may use only SFTP. One group may do local port forwarding and get interactive sessions with  574    Chapter 17: SecureCRT and SecureFX for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   their defined shells, but not remote forwarding or arbitrary remote command execution, except for one user in that group, who still gets full access. Of course, the efficacy of such measures depends on further work: it does little good to restrict remote commands, for example, if any program can be started by the user’s shell. But VShell provides these restrictions at the right place: in terms of the basic SSH channel types used to invoke the services. Other SSH products often do not have this level of control, and require awkward and frag- ile combinations of special shells or specific authentication methods to achieve the same goal.  GSSAPI  Support for emerging GSSAPI Kerberos SSH standards for both client and server authentication.  Very understandable debug messages  Don’t underestimate the value of readable verbose messages! There will always be problems, and logging is your main tool for solving them. Reading the ver- bose output of some SSH products can be an art in itself. VShell’s messages are particularly well done.  17.10 Summary VanDyke’s SSH products are mature, stable, and well rounded, and have good ven- dor support. The GUI clients SecureCRT and SecureFX both work well. The com- mand-line clients are not as flexible as OpenSSH and Tectia’s, but they cover the basics and get the job done. The VShell server supports some interesting features and is well worth checking out.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Enter PuTTY, a tiny, uncomplicated, free SSH client for Microsoft Windows.* There’s no installation procedure, no steep learning curve, and in many cases, no configuration needed.  At press time, PuTTY was still labeled as “beta” software, but don’t be discouraged: it’s a robust and just plain useful SSH client. Thanks to Simon Tatham for creating the PuTTY suite of programs, releasing them as free software, and writing a detailed manual on his web site. Because PuTTY’s manual is very good, we’ll focus on the most common uses. This chapter covers PuTTY Version 0.56.  18.1 Obtaining and Installing Installation of PuTTY is as easy as it gets. Just download the putty.exe executable from:  http:  www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ~sgtatham putty   and run it. This simplicity is especially handy if you’re traveling and need an SSH cli- ent; PuTTY is just a quick download away.  18.2 Basic Client Use To get started, just run  or double-click  putty.exe. The PuTTY Configuration dialog shown in Figure 18-1 will appear:  For a quick start, locate the box labeled “Host Name  or IP address ,” enter the host- name of your remote server machine, and click the Open button. A terminal win- dow then appears and prompts you for your login name and password. Assuming  * It’s also available for Unix, but OpenSSH and Tectia are so widespread that we don’t see much point in using  PuTTY on Unix platforms.  576  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Figure 18-1. PuTTY Configuration dialog  there’s nothing unusual about your SSH server, you’re done: PuTTY establishes a secure login session with the server.  PuTTY supports not only SSH, but also insecure protocols like Telnet and Rlogin. Make sure your connections are using the SSH protocol by selecting SSH on the initial PuTTY Configuration dialog. SSH is the default protocol for the other programs in the suite, such as Plink, PSFTP, and PSCP.  18.2.1 Plink, a Console Client PuTTY comes with a second SSH terminal client, Plink, which is reminiscent of the ssh client of OpenSSH and Tectia. For a quick start, open a command window and type:  C:\> plink smith@server.example.com  This command connects you via SSH to server.example.com, logging in as remote user smith.  Plink is most appropriate for noninteractive use: for example, setting up tunnels for port forwarding, or running inside batch jobs. It can also handle interactive logins,  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  18.2 Basic Client Use    577   but PuTTY is a better choice, particularly for screen-based programs like text edi- tors. The Windows command line is not a particularly good terminal emulator.  The plink client has many command-line options, similar to those of ssh. Run plink by itself to see a list of valid options, as shown in Table 18-1.  Table 18-1. plink command-line options  Option 1 2 C -i keyname -l username -load session -m filename -pw P -P port -s -t -T -v V  Meaning Use SSH-1 protocol. Use SSH-2 protocol. Use compression for the SSH connection. [7.4.14] Use the private key keyname. Specify the remote username  if omitted, it defaults to your local username . Load settings from a saved session. Read remote commands from the file filename. Use password P. Use TCP port port to connect to the remote SSH server. Use an SSH subsystem. [5.8] Allocate a pseudo-terminal  pty . Do not allocate a pseudo-terminal.  pty . Print verbose diagnostics. Display the program version.  18.2.2 Running Remote Commands Instead of an interactive terminal session, PuTTY and Plink can run a single com- mand of your choice, then exit immediately. It’s simplest with Plink: just append the remote command to the Plink command line. For example, to run the ls  list files  command on a remote Linux machine running an SSH server, type:  C:\> plink smith@server.example.com ls  With PuTTY, visit the PuTTY Configuration dialog and look under Connection  SSH. Fill in the blank labeled “Remote command,” then connect. The command will run and PuTTY will terminate afterward.  18.3 File Transfer The PuTTY suite includes two programs for copying your files securely between machines. PSCP is a noninteractive program much like scp, and PSFTP is an interac- tive program inspired by ftp.  578    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   File Transfer with PSCP  18.3.1 PuTTY’s pscp client is for copying files securely between machines, just like scp from OpenSSH and Tectia. Also like scp, pscp is noninteractive.  For an interactive client, see psftp. [18.3.2]   The syntax for PSCP is almost identical to that of scp. [7.5] Remote files are refer- enced by:  [user@]host:path  where user is the remote username, host is the remote hostname, and path is the folder path to the file in question.  File Transfer with PSFTP  18.3.2 PSCP can copy files securely between computers, but the user interface is noninterac- tive. If you prefer a familiar FTP-like interface, try PSFTP, PuTTY’s interactive file- transfer program. To start a file copying session with remote computer server. example.com, run:  C:\> psftp server.example.com login as: smith Using username "smith". smith@server.example.com's password: Remote working directory is  home smith psftp>  The prompt psftp> indicates that PSFTP is ready to accept commands. If you’re familiar with FTP, the PSFTP commands will make you feel right at home. To trans- fer a file from your local machine to the remote server, use:  psftp> put myfile  or to copy a local file, myfile, as remote file remotefile:  psftp> put myfile remotefile  This is equivalent to the PSCP command:  C:\> scp myfile server.example.com:remotefile  In the other direction, to transfer files from the remote server to your local machine, use get:  To traverse the directory  folder  hierarchy of the remote machine, use the cd com- mand as in DOS or Unix:  psftp> get remotefile psftp> get remotefile myfile  psftp> cd my_remote_subfolder psftp> cd ..  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  18.3 File Transfer    579   To change your working directory on the local machine, use lcd:  psftp> lcd my_local_subfolder psftp> lcd ..  For a full list of commands, type help, or for assistance with a particular command, specify the command name as well  e.g., help put . Table 18-2 lists the available com- mands. Unfortunately, PSFTP does not include the useful mput and mget commands for transferring many files at once.  Table 18-2. PSFTP commands  Basic commands: open bye, exit, quit help ! Directory  folder  commands: dir, ls cd lcd pwd lpwd mkdir rmdir File commands: get put reget  reput  mv, ren rm, del chmod  Open an SFTP connection to a remote server. Exit PSFTP. Get a help message. Shell escape: run a command-line program on your local computer.  List a directory. Change directory  remote machine . Change directory  local machine . Print the name of the directory you’re in  remote machine . Print the name of the directory you’re in  local machine . Create a directory. Delete a directory.  Download a file. Upload a file. Restart a download that you tried previously, but failed; will pick up where the previous download left off. Restart an upload that you tried previously, but failed; will pick up where the pre- vious upload left off. Rename a file. Delete a file. Change permissions of a file, like the Unix chmod command.  18.4 Key Management If you’d like to use public-key authentication to connect to remote hosts [2.4], PuTTY includes a key generator program, called PuTTYgen. It has a simple graphi- cal user interface for creating and editing RSA and DSA keys, as shown in Figure 18-2.  580    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Figure 18-2. PuTTYgen, the key generator  To create a new key, simply click the Generate button. You’ll be asked to waggle your mouse around to supply random numbers to the generator, then to supply a passphrase. To edit an existing key, just click the Load button.  You might remember that OpenSSH and Tectia use different file formats for their keys. PuTTYgen uses the SECSH format for public keys [6.1.2], but its own unique format for private keys. The private key is stored in a file with the suffix .ppk and looks like this:  PuTTY-User-Key-File-2: ssh-rsa Encryption: aes256-cbc Comment: Your comment here Public-Lines: 4 AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIBltDpO1wC9qJ98peVr5y9C7N9vdOh+OrCNwbIh lba1oSf94rrDl1TQXKXxgIHSd1ICgh7wkdxFWbyDRXSuWdur6kreTGRaw9XgCzQt LyANMtKAPpDYVE1g8jb6jA1bOMtK8b+pGPmetbvdyBDmFcQ oPwYyrZIjfbd8IdK FxxJvw== Private-Lines: 8 3ryAyuTLEnYuLGsetfNvazRYOhxQmzBWSyMLyT2i+zt7QqArlPglY1Um3NBJlYgS caHDiLyH95tV2onEeBThJzYFAvgrr7UlXVjQTDLr29fe2FTS bNm4OahTaKzTNV4 0EojvG1yafCucaZMVwsndB4djpm4otJja+xDVLN7Wj3ibzUT+SfodSJyazMAjB0y Q3ndbcqcIPPg4OM3sL8c09KTVdcuLkkyKMSV5yEgTAP0RG0M+T8 ChHLFLHswwV+  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

In the file dialog, be sure to set the file type to “All Files  *.* ” so that your non-PuTTY keys show up.     To write an OpenSSH or Tectia private key, use the Conversion menu and select  “Export OpenSSH key” or “Export ssh.com key.”    To write an OpenSSH public key, copy and paste the key shown at the top of the window, under “Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file.” To write a Tectia public key, do nothing: PuTTY’s public keys are already in SECSH format.  Choosing a Key  18.4.1 To select the private key for PuTTY to use, open the PuTTY Configuration dialog and visit Connection SSH Auth. Under “Private key file for authentication,” browse to and select your key of choice.  Make sure the corresponding public key is prop- erly installed on the server. [6.2]   If you’re using Plink, you can choose the key on the command line with the –i option:  C:\> plink -i c:\keys\me.ppk smith@server.example.com  18.4.2 Pageant, an SSH Agent An SSH agent goes hand in hand with public-key authentication. [6.3] PuTTY has an agent, called Pageant, that caches private keys  stores them in memory  and responds to authentication-related queries from PuTTY, PSCP, and other clients in the suite. In short, Pageant is a timesaver, so you don’t have to keep retyping your passphrase.  To run Pageant, just double-click it or invoke it from the command line.  Even bet- ter, add pageant.exe to your system startup so that it’s always available when you boot or log in.  An icon will appear in the Windows System Tray on the taskbar. Right-click the icon and you can load keys into the agent, view your keys, or per- form other operations, as shown in Figure 18-3.  To add a key, you’ll need to know its passphrase.  Once a key is loaded into Pageant, the various PuTTY clients will use the key transparently, and you won’t have to retype its passphrase.  582    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Figure 18-3. Pageant, the PuTTY agent  You can also run Pageant on the command line. Just follow it with one or more keys you’d like to load, e.g.:  C:\> pageant key1 key2 key3 and it will dutifully load them.  Speaking of agents, PuTTY also supports agent forwarding [6.3.5], but only for OpenSSH servers, not Tectia servers. Just make sure the option “Allow agent for- warding” is checked in PuTTY’s configuration window; or if you’re using Plink, add the –A option to enable agent forwarding or –a to disable it.  18.5 Advanced Client Use PuTTY is simple to use in its most basic form. Nevertheless, its clients have many options that are worth trying out. We will cover the ones relating to SSH. Other terminal-related features, like settings for the window, keyboard, and mouse, we encourage you to explore on your own.  Saved Sessions  18.5.1 If you have a habit of connecting to the same remote machines often, set up a Saved Session, which remembers the settings for that connection so that you can reuse them. This is similar to the OpenSSH and Tectia feature of configuration files, but with a GUI. [7.1.2] Simply configure PuTTY the way you like it, then save that con- figuration under a name, such as “My Favorite Settings” or “office.”  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  18.5 Advanced Client Use    583   When you create and name a Saved Session, it becomes available not only to PuTTY, but also to the other programs in PuTTY’s suite, such as PSCP and Plink. Just pro- vide the saved session’s name in place of a hostname. For example, if you created a Saved Session called “office” to stand for employer.example.com, you could run:  C:\> plink office  and it will connect to employer.example.com.  Saved Sessions are stored in the Windows registry under the key \HKEY_CURRENT_ USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions.  18.5.2 Host Keys Like other SSH implementations, PuTTY records the host keys of SSH servers it encounters. They are stored in the Windows registry under the key \HKEY_CURRENT_ USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys.  Choosing a Protocol Version  18.5.3 We always recommend you use the SSH-2 protocol, since it is more secure and robust than the original SSH-1. Nevertheless, PuTTY does support both protocols, and you can choose your preferred protocol on the PuTTY Configuration dialog, under Connection SSH. The choices are:  1 only  1  2  2 only  Require SSH-1, or else fail.  Try SSH-1 first, then SSH-2.  Try SSH-2 first, then SSH-1.  Require SSH-2, or else fail  recommended .  With Plink, you can force the protocol version with the -1  SSH-1 only  and -2  SSH- 2  options:  C:\> plink -2 smith@server.example.com  TCP IP Settings  18.5.4 SSH uses TCP IP as its transport mechanism, and PuTTY gives you control over some TCP-related settings.  584    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   18.5.4.1 Selecting a remote port SSH servers almost always run on TCP port 22, but if you encounter a nonstandard server, you can choose a port in the PuTTY Configuration dialog, under Connec- tion. Locate the Port value and fill it in.  With Plink, just specify the –P option to set the port number:  C:\> plink -P 12345 smith@server.example.com  18.5.4.2 Keepalive messages SSH clients can optionally send TCP keepalive messages to an SSH server to recog- nize when a connection has failed. [7.4.5.4] If the client detects a lack of responses to these messages, it shuts down the connection. You can enable or disable this feature in the PuTTY Configuration dialog, under Connection.  18.5.4.3 The Nagle Algorithm TCP IP has a feature called the Nagle Algorithm, which is designed to reduce the number of TCP segments sent with very small amounts of data  e.g., 1 byte , usually as part of an interactive terminal session. This can affect performance over wide-area networks. [7.4.5.5] PuTTY lets you enable or disable the Nagle Algorithm in the PuTTY Configuration dialog, under Connection.  18.5.5 Pseudo-Terminal Allocation SSH clients allocate a pseudo-terminal on the server machine: a software abstraction representing a computer terminal. [7.4.6.5] PuTTY does this by default, but you can prevent this in the PuTTY Configuration dialog, under Connection SSH.  Because PuTTY is designed as a terminal client, which is interactive, you generally can leave this setting alone. But if you’re using PuTTY noninteractively, say, only to set up port forwarding—you don’t strictly need a pseudo-terminal. If you’re using Plink, you can disable pseudo-terminal allocation with the –T option or leave it enabled with –t.  18.5.6 Proxies and SOCKS PuTTY supports SOCKS, an application-layer network proxying system supported by various SSH implementations. [7.4.7] You can enable it in the PuTTY Configura- tion dialog, under Connection Proxy.  Encryption Algorithms  18.5.7 On the Connection SSH section of the PuTTY Configuration dialog, you can choose the encryption algorithms  ciphers  acceptable to the client. [7.4.9] Any algorithms  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  18.5 Advanced Client Use    585   appearing below the line “—warn below here—” will cause PuTTY to display a warning before they are used.  For most people, the defaults are fine. But if, say, a security hole were found in one of the algorithms  say, Blowfish , you could move it below the line, and PuTTY will warn before using it.  18.5.8 Authentication PuTTY supports the following authentication types: password, public-key, chal- lenge-response  a.k.a. keyboard-interactive , and TIS. [7.4.13] Password authentica- tion works by default. Public-key authentication requires you to set up a key, as we’ve seen. [2.4] Challenge-response authentication is enabled in the PuTTY Config- uration dialog, under Connection SSH Auth. [5.4.5]  TIS authentication is uncommon: it authenticates users via the Gauntlet firewall toolkit from Trusted Information Systems. It works only for the SSH-1 protocol so we recommend against using it. That being said, it is enabled in the PuTTY Configu- ration dialog, under Connection SSH Auth.  Compression  18.5.9 The data flowing between the SSH client and server may optionally be compressed to save bandwidth. [7.4.14] To enable compression, open the PuTTY Configuration dialog and look under Connection SSH. If you’re using Plink, add the –C option to enable compression:  C:\> plink -C smith@server.example.com  18.5.10 Logging and Debugging If you’re having a connection problem with PuTTY, you can capture the session data in a file. Open the PuTTY Configuration dialog and look under Session Logging. Here you select the file to receive the data, and four different settings:  Logging completely turned off As it says, do no logging.  Log printable output only  Log all session output  This simply captures the text of your terminal session, and is not very useful for debugging.  This captures not only the text of your session, but also any nonprinting control characters. This is useful for debugging terminal emulation problems, e.g., if your favorite text editor isn’t behaving when viewed through PuTTY.  586    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Log SSH packet data  This is the big one: the actual SSH data, unencrypted, that passes over the con- nection. It appears in hexadecimal and ASCII, annotated with high-level infor- mation such as “Doing Diffie-Hellman group exchange” and “Access denied.” If you’re debugging an SSH problem, this is the logging you need. However, it’s not very user-friendly: you’ll need substantial knowledge of the SSH protocol to figure out what’s going on.  If you select “Log SSH packet data,” always select “Omit known pass- word fields” as well. Otherwise, sensitive data like passwords will be captured in the log file, which is a security risk if the log file is read or stolen by a hostile third party.  If you’re using Plink, you can display diagnostic information with the –v option:  C:\> plink -v smith@server.example.com Server version: SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1 We claim version: SSH-2.0-PuTTY-Release-0.56 Using SSH protocol version 2 Doing Diffie-Hellman group exchange Doing Diffie-Hellman key exchange Host key fingerprint is: ssh-dss 1024 80:de:c6:fa:f7:82:4f:c7:c4:8c:1f:6f:d4:40:4b:0e Initialised AES-256 client->server encryption Initialised AES-256 server->client encryption ...  18.5.11 Batch Jobs SSH can be used within batch jobs to secure their communications. [11.1] With PuTTY, batch jobs are most easily done with Plink and its -batch option:  C:\> plink -batch smith@server.example.com my-job  The -batch option suppresses all user prompts. But wait: just because you’ve dis- abled prompts doesn’t automatically authenticate you. You’ll also need to set up passwordless authentication. Otherwise, you’ll simply fail to authenticate, prompts or no.  18.6 Forwarding Forwarding or tunneling is the use of SSH to secure another network application, covered fully in Chapter 9. Both PuTTY and Plink can set up secure tunnels for this purpose.  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  18.6 Forwarding    587   Forwarding with PuTTY  18.6.1 Forwarding is set up with the PuTTY Configuration dialog. For local port forward- ing, which is the most common type, select Tunnels. Then fill in these fields:  Source port  Destination  Any unused TCP IP port on your local machine.  The remote SSH server name, followed by a colon, followed by the remote port number.  Local Remote Dynamic  Choose Local.  For example, to connect to a remote VNC server  port 5900  on server.example.com, you’d provide a destination of server.example.com:5900, and any unused source port  say, 12345 . This example demonstrates local forwarding [9.2.1], but PuTTY can also do remote [9.2.1.2] and dynamic [9.3] port forwarding.  To turn on X forwarding [9.4] for secure connections with an X Window server, sim- ply choose Tunnels again and select the checkbox Enable X11 Forwarding.  To turn on agent forwarding [6.3.5] to allow your SSH agent to communicate with clients on other machines, navigate to Connection SSH Auth and select the check- box Allow Agent Forwarding.  Forwarding with Plink  18.6.2 To enable the various kinds of forwarding with the command-line program Plink:  Local port forwarding [9.2.1]  Use the –L option, supplying the source port, remote server name, and remote port. For example, to forward local port 12345 to remote port 5900 on server. example.com, run:  C:\> plink server.example.com -L 12345:server.example.com:5900  Remote port forwarding [9.2.1.2]  Use the –R option, supplying the remote source port, local server name, and local port. For example, to forward remote port 12345 on outerspace.example. com to your local port 5900, run:  C:\> plink outerspace.example.com -R 12345:localhost:5900  Dynamic port forwarding [9.3]  Use the –D option. For example, to perform dynamic port forwarding via proxy on port 12345, run:  C:\> plink -D 12345 server.example.com  588    Chapter 18: PuTTY for Windows  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   X forwarding [9.4]  Use the –X option to enable it, or –x to disable it  Agent forwarding [6.3.5]  Use the –A option to enable it, or –a to disable it.  18.7 Summary PuTTY is a small, useful SSH client for Windows  and available for Linux if you don’t already have another SSH client installed . Its major benefit is its simplicity— just download and start using it—but under the hood it has additional powerful fea- tures for the inquisitive user.

Just before this book was printed, OpenSSH 4.0 was released by those fine folks at openssh.com. While compatible with Version 3.9, it has several important new features that we discuss briefly.  We cover just features, not bug fixes.   Server Features: sshd The OpenSSH server has new features pertaining to logging, listening addresses, and password and account expiration warnings.  Logging of Access Control Violations When authentication attempts are rejected by user-level access control  AllowUsers, DenyUsers  or group-level access control  AllowGroups, DenyGroups , sshd will log an informative message about it.  AddressFamily Keyword The AddressFamily configuration keyword, previously available to clients only, can now be configured for the SSH server as well. If your server supports both IPv4 and IPv6, this lets you control on which sort of addresses sshd will listen.  Password and Account Expiration Warnings If your password or account is going to expire  on operating systems that support expiration , sshd will now warn you in advance when you authenticate—for example.:  Your password will expire in 6 days Your account will expire in 11 days  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  591   Client Features: ssh, scp, and sftp OpenSSH clients have new features pertaining to keyboard-interactive authentica- tion, connection sharing, known-hosts handling, port forwarding, and command- line editing and history.  KbdInteractiveDevices Keyword The KbdInteractiveDevices keyword was undocumented in OpenSSH 3.9, but now it’s officially supported. It determines the devices that the client will try for keyboard-interactive authentication.  KbdInteractiveDevices = pam,skey,bsdauth  More Control for Connection Sharing If you’re using the connection-sharing feature of ssh, you can now control the mas- ter process of that connection with the –O option. To check whether you’re using connection sharing, run the following:  $ ssh -O check server.example.com  To request the master process to exit, run the following:  $ ssh -O exit server.example.com  Hashing of Hostnames In previous versions of OpenSSH, known_host files contain the hostnames and IP addresses of the computer’s you’ve visited via SSH. If you’d like to keep this informa- tion more private, use the new HashKnownHosts configuration keyword in your client configuration file:  HashKnownHosts yes  SSH clients will now hash the hostnames so they look like random strings—for example:  1Un5Q61BdVPCq65Yj3ec HH6r+zI=2pPQE qjP7rrPLblvS1epjYbUOs=  This feature is experimental at the moment, so use it at your own risk.  Port Forwarding When you construct a port forwarding, you can now specify a bind address: the address on which the accepting side of the forwarding will listen. This is useful either for controlling whether a forwarding is available off-host  not listening on only on the loopback , or distinguishing among multiple addresses if the listening host is multi- homed. You give the bind address on the command line, preceding the usual –L or –R  592    Appendix A: OpenSSH 4.0 New Features  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   value. For example, to set up a local forwarding from local port 2001 to remote server port 143  IMAP , listening on 192.168.100.66:  $ ssh -L 192.168.100.66:2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  or for a remote forwarding:  $ ssh -R 192.168.100.66:2001:localhost:143 server.example.com  You can also do this with the LocalForward and RemoteForward configuration key- words, prepending the bind address to the second argument:  LocalForward 2001 192.168.100.66:localhost:143 RemoteForward 2001 192.168.100.66:localhost:143  Note that this forwarding will not be listening on the loopback address. You need to connect to 192.168.100.66:2001, even on the server itself; trying to connect to local- host:2001 will result in “connection refused.” Also note that the bind address refers to the client for local forwarding and to the server for remote forwarding.  For local forwarding, the default binding is determined by the GatewayPorts key- word. For remote forwarding, the server may choose to honor or ignore a client’s binding request using a new GatewayPorts value, clientspecified:  GatewayPorts clientspecified  This means the SSH client can select the binding address for the forwarding. This permits clients to bind addresses for remote forwardings  An empty binding address, or the special value *, indicates that the client or server should listen on all interfaces  including real ones and the loopback interface for localhost .  sftp Command-Line Features The sftp client now supports command-line history and editing using Emacs-like keystrokes. You’ll need the libedit library installed on your computer, available from http:  sourceforge.net projects libedit. This feature is controlled at compile time with the flag --with-libedit.  ssh-keygen If you’re using the experimental hostname hashing feature described earlier, ssh- keygen has some new command-line options to support it.  Hashing Your Known Hosts File ssh-keygen can convert your known_hosts file to use hashes with the –H option:  $ ssh-keygen -H  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  ssh-keygen    593   The ssh-keygen manpage claims that the results of ssh-keygen -H are written to standard output, but this is not true. The command modi- fies your ~ .ssh known_hosts file directly. It also stashes a copy of the old file in ~ .ssh known_hosts.old for safety, but don’t depend on this: running ssh-keygen -H twice obliterates the safe copy.  Managing Hosts Once you’ve hashed your hostnames, it’s hard to edit the known_hosts file because you can’t read which line corresponds to which host. ssh-keygen provides new com- mands for locating and removing hosts from the file. To locate a particular host in the file, use the –F option:  $ ssh-keygen -F server.example.com  Host server.example.com found: line 3 type RSA1 server.example.com 1024 35 1301302858553510086.....  To remove a known host, use the –R option and provide the original hostname:  $ ssh-keygen -R server.example.com  home smith .ssh known_hosts updated. Original contents retained as  home smith .ssh known_hosts.old  594    Appendix A: OpenSSH 4.0 New Features  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc.

Appendix B  APPENDIX B Tectia Manpage for sshregex  This document describes the regular expressions  or globbing patterns  used in file- name globbing with scp2 and sftp2 and in the configuration files ssh2_config and sshd2_config.  Regex syntax used with scp2 and sftp2 is ZSH_FILEGLOB.  Regex Syntax: Egrep Patterns The escape character is a backslash  \ . You can use it to escape metacharacters to use them in their plain character form.  In the following examples, literal E and F denote any expression, whether a pattern or a character:  Start a capturing subexpression. End a capturing subexpression.

Literal carriage return.  Literal tab.  All other escaped characters denote the literal character itself.  Regex Syntax: ZSH_FILEGLOB  or Traditional  Patterns The escape character is a backslash  \ . With this you can escape metacharacters to use them in their plain character form.  In the following examples, literal E and F denote any expression, whether a pattern or a character:  Match any string consisting of zero or more characters. The characters can be any characters apart from slashes    . However, the asterisk does not match a string if the string contains a dot  .  as its first character, or if the string contains a dot immediately after a slash. This means that the asterisk cannot be used to match filenames that have a dot as their first character. If the previous character is a slash    , or if an asterisk  *  is used to denote a match at the beginning of a string, it does match a dot  . . That is, the asterisk  *  functions as normal in Unix shell fileglobs.  Match any single character except for a slash    . However, do not match a dot  .  if located at the beginning of the string, or if the previous character is a slash    . That is, the question mark  ?  functions as normal in Unix shell fileglobs  at least in ZSH, although discarding the dot may not be a standard procedure .  Match any sequence of characters that is either empty, or ends in a slash. How- ever, the substring  . is not allowed. This mimics the **  construct in ZSH.  Please note that ** is equivalent to *.

It is also possible to include the predefined escaped character sets into a newly defined one, so:  [\d\s]  matches digits and whitespace characters.  Regex Syntax: SSH Patterns The escape character is a tilde ~. With this you can escape metacharacters to use them in their plain character form.

All rights reserved.   Appendix DRi  APPENDIX D SSH-1 Features of OpenSSH and Tectia  This appendix describes the SSH-1 protocol features of OpenSSH and Tectia. Since we recommend against using SSH-1, you might never encounter these features, but we mention them for completeness.  OpenSSH Features  Serverwide Conﬁguration KeyRegenerationInterval  or sshd -k   Set the number of seconds between generations of the SSH-1 server key. This temporary key is used only for SSH-1 connections. The default is 3600 seconds  1 hour , and a value of zero disables regeneration.  RhostsRSAAuthentication  Permit or deny authentication by the RSA key together with authentication by rhosts files.  RSAAuthentication  Permit or deny authentication by the RSA key.  ServerKeyBits  or sshd -b   Set the number of bits in the SSH-1 server key: see KeyRegenerationInterval above. The default is 768 bits, and the fewest allowable is 512 bits.  Client Conﬁguration Cipher  Replaced by Ciphers for SSH-2 protocol connections  RhostsRSAAuthentication  Same as for serverwide configuration  RSAAuthentication  Same as for serverwide configuration  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.  609   Files ~ .ssh identity, ~ .ssh identity.pub  These files contain your default private and public keys, respectively, for public- key authentication.   etc ssh ssh_host_key  This system file contains the SSH-1 protocol  RSA  host key.  Tectia Features Tectia provides limited support for SSH-1, mostly by running programs from some older implementation whenever the SSH-1 protocol is required. Some of the Tectia programs do have built-in support for SSH-1, however.  Serverwide Conﬁguration The Tectia server has no built-in support for SSH-1, but it can be configured to run a separate SSH-1 server for SSH-1 clients. See “Compatibility Between SSH-1 and SSH- 2 Servers” in Chapter 5.  The following keywords in the  etc ssh2 sshd2_config file control SSH-1 compatibil- ity mode:  Run the SSH-1 server when SSH-1 clients connect  if yes .  Ssh1Compatibility  Sshd1Path  Sshd1ConfigFile  The pathname for the SSH-1 server.  An alternate configuration file for the SSH-1 server, replacing the one specified for the Tectia server by the –f command-line option.  Client Conﬁguration The ssh -1t option runs an SSH-1 client program, and ssh -1i uses built-in SSH-1 emulation. See “Choosing a protocol version” in Chapter 7.  The following keywords in the  etc ssh2 ssh2_config file control SSH-1 compatibility mode:  Ssh1Compatibility  Ssh1InternalEmulation  Use SSH-1 if the server supports only supports the older protocol  if yes , or oth- erwise fail  if no .  Use the Tectia client’s built-in SSH-1 functionality  if yes , or otherwise run an external SSH-1 program  if no .  610    Appendix D: SSH-1 Features of OpenSSH and Tectia  This is the Title of the Book, eMatter Edition  Copyright   2008 O’Reilly & Associates, Inc. All rights reserved.   Ssh1Path  The pathname for the external SSH-1 program.  Ssh1MaskPasswordLength  Send SSH_MSG_IGNORE packets with SSH-1 sessions to obscure the length of the password  if yes, the default . Otherwise, the unencrypted length fields used by SSH-1 can be easily intercepted.  Ssh1AgentCompatibility  Specifies whether and how to do agent forwarding. The value is one of: none  Don’t forward SSH-1 agent connections  the default .  traditional  ssh2  Forward SSH-1 agent connections with no information about the forward- ing path.  Forward SSH-1 agent connections, and add information about the forward- ing path as for SSH-2. This requires using the Tectia agent in SSH-1 compat- ibility mode.  File Transfers scp can run a program scp1 for file transfers using SSH-1. No mechanism is provided to specify an alternate name for the compatibility mode program  or a complete pathname: the scp1 program is always found by searching the PATH .  If the scp -1 option [7.5.9] is specified as the first option on the command line, then scp1 is run for SSH-1 compatibility, with the rest of the arguments passed verbatim.  scp1 is also run if the –t or –f command-line options are used. These options were used for old implementations of the remote scp server.  Key Management The ssh-keygen -1 option converts a key  in a file specified as an argument for the option  from an older format used by some SSH-1 implementations to the new for- mat used by Tectia.  Authentication Agent The ssh-agent -1 option causes the agent to handle requests from SSH-1 clients.  Keys added with the ssh-add -1 option are an exception: they are not allowed to be used for SSH-1 operations.  The ssh client uses the keyword Ssh1AgentCompatibility to control agent forward- ing, as described previously.

Currently working as a software engineer, Dan has also been a heavy metal singer, Unix system administrator, university lecturer, web designer, and humorist. He is the author of O’Reilly’s Linux Pocket Guide, and is the coauthor of Linux Security Cook- book and the first edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. He also writes monthly columns for Compute! and Keyboard Magazine, as well as articles for the O’Reilly Network.  Richard E. Silverman has a B.A. in computer science and an M.A. in pure mathe- matics. Richard has worked in the fields of networking, formal methods in software development, public-key infrastructure, routing security, and Unix systems adminis- tration. He coauthored the first edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide, and he loves to read, study languages and mathematics, sing, dance, and exercise.  Robert G. Byrnes, Ph.D., has been hacking on Unix systems for 20 years, and has been involved with security issues since the original Internet worm was launched from Cornell University, while he was a graduate student and system administrator. Currently, he’s a software engineer at Curl Corporation. He has worked in the fields of networking, telecommunications, distributed computing, financial technology, and condensed matter physics.  Colophon  Our look is the result of reader comments, our own experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels. Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to technical topics, breathing personality and life into potentially dry subjects.  The animal on the cover of SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide is a land snail  Mollusca gastropoda .  A member of the mollusk family, a snail has a soft, moist body that is protected by a hard shell, into which it can retreat when in danger or when in arid or bright condi- tions. Snails prefer wet weather and, though not nocturnal, will stay out of bright sun. At the front of a snail’s long body are two sets of tentacles: its eyes are at the end of one set, and the other set is used for smelling and navigation.  Land snails are hermaphrodites, each having both female and male sex organs, though a snail must mate with another snail in order for fertilization to occur. A snail lays eggs approximately six times a year, with almost 100 eggs each time. Young snails hatch in a month and become adults in two years. A snail’s life span is approx- imately 5–10 years.  Known as a slow mover, a snail moves by muscles on its underside that contract and expand, propelling the snail along at a slow pace. It leaves a wet trail of mucus,   which protects the snail from anything sharp it may need to crawl over as it searches for food. The snail’s diet of plants, bark, and fruits causes it to be a pest in many parts of the world where it is notorious for destroying crops.  Mary Brady was the production editor for SSH, the Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. Audrey Doyle proofread the book. Marlowe Shaeffer and Mary Anne Weeks Mayo provided quality control. Lydia Onofrei provided production assistance. John Bickelhaupt wrote the index.  Ellie Volckhausen designed the cover of this book, based on a series design by Edie Freedman. The cover image is an original engraving from the book Natural History of Animals by Sanborn Tenney and Abby A. Tenney, published by Scribner, Armstrong & Co. in 1873. Karen Montgomery produced the cover layout with Adobe InDesign CS  using Adobe’s ITC Garamond font.  David Futato designed the interior layout. This book was converted by Keith Fahl- gren to FrameMaker 5.5.6 with a format conversion tool created by Erik Ray, Jason McIntosh, Neil Walls, and Mike Sierra that uses Perl and XML technologies. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont’s TheSans Mono Condensed. The illustrations that appear in the book were produced by Robert Romano, Jessamyn Read, and Lesley Borash using Macromedia FreeHand MX and Adobe Photoshop CS. The tip and warning icons were drawn by Christopher Bing. This colophon was written by Nicole Arigo.

It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is "transparent" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique "tunneling" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.
