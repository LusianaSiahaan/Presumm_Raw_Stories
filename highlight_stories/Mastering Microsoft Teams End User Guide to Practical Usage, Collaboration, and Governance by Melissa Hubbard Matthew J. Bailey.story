The virtual workspace  provided by Microsoft Teams offers a plethora of time-saving and efficiency features  that organizations of all sizes can benefit from. Since Microsoft Teams is such a new  application, the story is still being written on the value realized by implementation and  adoption. In order for organizations to fully appreciate Microsoft Teams, end users must  be fully adept in how to use the features. Moreover, business owners must understand  how to provide training, governance, and drive user adoption of Microsoft Teams. In this  book, all of these scenarios are addressed.  Mastering Microsoft Teams is for anyone that is planning to begin using Microsoft   Teams, as well as anyone that has already been using Microsoft Teams but wants to learn  more. Additionally, business owners, project managers, and IT decision makers will  benefit from Mastering Microsoft Teams, as management, governance, user adoption,  and training are examined at length.  The layout of the book begins by answering what Microsoft Teams is, followed by  chapters on how to work, communicate, and hold meetings in Teams. These chapters  provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform different actions, as well as tips and  tricks to help you get the most out of the application. The next chapters focus on user  adoption and governance. These are very important chapters for IT decision makers and  business owners, but all Microsoft Teams users will benefit from gaining insight on how  to best manage and plan for Microsoft Teams.  Microsoft Teams is continously updated with additional functionality. Depending on   when you are reading this book, we acknowledge that many things may have changed  already. The final chapter discusses known issues with and the limitations of Microsoft  Teams, as well as what is planned for the future.  xv   CHAPTER 1  Introduction to   Microsoft Teams  If you are reading this book, it is highly likely that you have heard some of the excitement  surrounding Microsoft Teams. Understanding the value of the application and knowing  about its components and how they interact with each other is a good way to start  learning about the product. In this chapter, we explain the different methods of accessing  Microsoft Teams and the different features that combine to make it work. If you’re ready  to begin your journey of learning Microsoft Teams, without further ado, let’s begin!  In today’s working world, we all struggle with being on a short schedule, trying to   connect with remote workers, and getting our job tasks completed on time. Often there  are many people required to work on the same information or documents to accomplish  a task. People’s work is spread across multiple locations, making it time- consuming and  confusing to multitask. These business problems can be resolved with Microsoft Teams.  Chat, meetings, video and voice calls, document collaboration, file storage and   sharing, retrieving information, notes, third-party tool integration, and more have been  combined into a hub for teamwork into the Microsoft Teams platform. Microsoft Teams  can be thought of as one “super application” that integrates many different apps into one  program so that you don’t have to open and connect to many apps separately.  Our favorite description of the product is this: “If someone put Skype for Business   Skype, Outlook’s meetings and mailbox, Office 365 Groups, a persistent chat client,  Word Excel PowerPoint, OneDrive for Business, a SharePoint site collection, and  Azure Active Directory  AAD , then mixed them together and cooked them in the oven,  Microsoft Teams would pop out.” You can then “season to taste” by adding countless  different other apps from Office 365 or outside companies to make a recipe of your own.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_1  1   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   Examples of other Microsoft apps you can add to a team are Microsoft Planner   for project management, Visual Studio Team Services for developer teams, a specific  SharePoint site for storage or collaboration, Power BI for data visualization, PowerApps  for semicomplex form creation, Stream for video, or Forms for simple data collection.  Some examples of non-Microsoft apps that you could add include GitHub for  developer’s code, Jira for project management, Adobe Sign for electronic signature  collection, and Hootsuite for social media monitoring.  Although Chapter 5 goes into more about real-world use cases for Microsoft Teams,  Figures 1-1 and 1-2 show how to set up and use a team. First, let’s start with what a new,  blank team looks like.  Figure 1-1.  A brand-new empty team  As you can see in Figure 1-1, there is not too much happening in a new team. Think  of it as an empty “virtual office” waiting to be filled with other co-workers or associates,  discussions, files, projects, and video calls. Microsoft Teams is a part of Microsoft’s  modern workplace, a vision that allows distributed people to work together in a digital,  flexible workspace.  2   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   As an example of what a team can look like in production, Figure 1-2 is a quick   screen shot of a team used for a new product launch. The team has added channels,  tabs, applications such as Adobe Sign and Power BI, files, meetings, chats, and many of  the other things that a team uses while working on a project. But don’t be overwhelmed!  There is a lot to learn as you make your journey through this book. Showing you what is  possible helps you get excited in learning it! Figure 1-2 shows what an active team with  lots of activity looks like.  Figure 1-2.  An example team for a new product launch with lots of activity and  interaction  Microsoft Teams is very fluid and can be used for many different purposes. A team  working on a new product launch, a group of people working to develop and launch a  small software product, or even authors collaborating to write a book are just a few of  examples of why people might use Microsoft Teams.  Having a goal of how you like to work, what you want to work on, and who you want   to work with should be a part of every team’s setup process. We review these topics in  more depth in upcoming chapters.  3   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs    How to Use and Access Teams As you see in Figure 1-3, Teams is accessible via three different methods. Each format that  you access a team in places slightly different parameters around what you can do with it.  As an example, you currently have the option to access a team through the following ways:     Your Internet browser by accessing your Office 365 tenant     The Teams client application installed on a Windows-based   computer  based smartphone     The app installed on either an iOS-based  Apple  or an Android-   Figure 1-3.  Teams is available as an installed client for Windows or Mac  computers, as an app for iPhones, Android phones, or Windows phones, and via  some web browsers.  What you will probably notice first is that based on which type of client you are   accessing, you have different features available to you. In the case of the Internet site or  Windows client vs. the smartphone app, this is pretty much an industry standard. Most  phone apps are not quite able to provide as much functionality as the other ways an  application might be created. For the most part, enough features exist on all platforms to  use the product successfully. Just be aware that the product has variances, and because  it is new to the market, will continue to have many features being added, changed, or  updated on its different clients.  4   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs    Background: The Journey from Skype Teams was built by the Skype for Business product group at Microsoft. Skype for Business  will eventually become Microsoft Teams, however, it is important to note that this is a  longer-term vision and not something that will happen immediately. At the moment, there  is still a Skype for Business 2019 version planned to rollout that will be supported for many  years. At the moment, Microsoft Teams is only available in the cloud; it is not available  to be installed on local servers. Although Teams works with an on-premises installation  of Microsoft Exchange  one of the pieces of Teams , it is important to note that currently  some of the features, such as eDiscovery for Teams, will not work in that scenario.  As a quick point of reference, to utilize all the functionality that Teams has available   and the new features continually being added, you need to be fully in the cloud on  the Office 365 suite and all the related applications  SharePoint, Exchange, Skype for  Business, and OneDrive for Business .  It is also important to note that although Microsoft Teams is built in part from Skype   for Business, not all the features from Skype for Business are available in Teams at the  moment. According to the Microsoft roadmap, however, they are in progress and should  be delivered in the near future  or have already been delivered, depending upon when  you are reading this book .   What Is Included When Creating a Team Microsoft Teams is a combination of different applications rolled into one. However, there  are some key ingredients that allow Teams to function. Each time you create a new team,  the following items are created in the background on Microsoft’s servers outside of Teams:     Office 365 Groups  Modern Groups —unless you choose an existing   group when you add a team     SharePoint site collection  with a document library      Exchange Online group mailbox  When you are using Microsoft Teams, it might not be immediately apparent that you  are using these other pieces of software because they are “masked” behind the Microsoft  Teams interface. One example of this is the Files tab in your team. In Figure 1-4, you can  see that your documents all appear to be in Teams. However, they are really stored in  SharePoint behind the scenes. We have elaborated this in Figure 1-4, which is similar to   5   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   the meetings that are stored in Outlook. As a regular user, this isn’t extremely important  to know; however, if you are the administrator of a Microsoft Teams environment, these  are key notes you want to be aware of because some of the maintenance and repairs that  you perform might be done directly in that software, and not via Microsoft Teams.  Figure 1-4.  An example of how the Microsoft Teams interface surfaces data from  other applications so that it “appears” as though it is all in one place   SharePoint and Teams When creating a team, one of the components it creates is a Modern SharePoint Online  site with a document library. SharePoint Online must be active in your tenant to work  with Microsoft Teams, because SharePoint On-Premises is not supported. The Shared  Documents library is created inside this team for you; however, there are ways to use an  existing document library from another SharePoint site if you currently have all of your  documents somewhere else.  Note  although each channel in Microsoft teams has a corresponding folder in  sharepoint online for the files that you work with, the folder is not created until  there is actually a file uploaded.  6   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   Some of the files that users upload are stored “behind the scenes” in this SharePoint   document library. Figure 1-5 shows a SharePoint document library holding these  documents. We go into where each file is stored later in this book.  Figure 1-5.  A document library created in SharePoint Online from a team   Using the SharePoint Site Collection Outside of Teams Whether or not we should encourage people to use the SharePoint site collection for other  reasons  workflows, lists, etc.  is a good question that depends on your own reasoning. At  the moment, the only portion of the SharePoint site collection that automatically appears  in Microsoft Teams is the Shared Documents folder. You can use other parts of SharePoint,  but you have to add them as a link from a tab or by adding cloud storage.  One potential upside of using the SharePoint site collection outside of the Teams  interface is that SharePoint has much greater granular security, and this is one way to  overcome the current limitation of no channel-based security in Teams. The downside  of this, however, is that you are opening both Microsoft Teams and SharePoint to manage  different artifacts.  7   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   Caution  although you can put other things into a sharepoint site collection to  add to the channel tab for easy access, changing the channels’ folder structure  does not update the channels in teams. It is important that you only create them  from the teams interface.   Groups and Teams Office 365 Groups  or Modern Groups  places users into meaningful groupings that  allow you to set notifications or security across many applications. Technically, an Office  365 group is an object in Azure Active Directory. It can have one or many members and  be used across most Office 365 applications. For example, you may have a marketing  department with salespeople working with them. You might create a group called  Marketing, add all of the employees from that area to this group, and then add the group  to the application s  you are using. This is much easier to manage than repeatedly  adding each user individually to each application for security and notifications.  The reason that Office 365 Groups matter in conjunction with Microsoft Teams is  because an Office 365 group is the parent of a team. Whenever you create a new team,  it creates an Office 365 group  unless you select to create a team from an existing Office  365 group . You also choose whether the team is private or public  the group is of this  same type . But in either case, behind the scenes, there is a group at a higher level that  controls your team’s security and other features. The relationship between Office 365  Groups and Teams becomes far more important later in the book as we dive into Teams  administration. For now, just understand that an Office 365 group is one of the many  pieces working to make your team function properly.   Exchange Outlook and Teams Like other Office 365 applications that Microsoft Teams interacts with, Exchange only  enables all of its benefits when it is fully online in the Office 365 suite. Although you can  use Exchange On-Premises or Exchange dedicated  legacy  with Microsoft Teams, some  functionality works and some does not. As a note, users hosted on Exchange Online or  Exchange Dedicated vNext have access to all the features in Microsoft Teams.  8   Chapter 1    IntroduCtIon to MICrosoft teaMs   The key takeaway is that Microsoft Teams uses Exchange to create a group mailbox   that stores the team’s information, such as meetings  messages are stored in a SharePoint  folder . To see which functionalities are enabled or disabled  this depends on your  version of Exchange , please visit the Microsoft website at https:  docs.microsoft. com en-us microsoftteams exchange-teams-interact.  Note  for the full Microsoft teams experience, every user should be enabled for  exchange online, sharepoint online, and office 365 Groups creation.   OneDrive for Business and Teams OneDrive for Business is used a bit within Microsoft Teams. Mostly, it is where files that  are shared from a team chat are stored  not a channel conversation . Permissions to the  files are restricted automatically so that only the intended user can access them.   Summary This chapter explained Microsoft Teams and the history of the platform, and reviewed its  core functionality. In the next chapter, we take a look at the components and how we get  work done within a team.  9   CHAPTER 2  Working in Teams  Teams and their channels are the heart of user collaboration and productivity. Although  Microsoft Teams can be used just for chatting and holding meetings, the true power  of the application is recognized by adding teams and channels and knowing how to  retrieve information from them. This chapter provides information and instructions on  how to maximize working with Microsoft Teams. We explore creating teams, channels,  and tabs, as well as searching by using the @commands and shortcuts.  What you can and cannot do in Microsoft Teams is based on the permission role you   have. There are currently three roles available in Teams:     Team member     Team owner     Guest  must be enabled by your administrator   By default, anyone within an organization can create a team. When they do, they   become the team owner. In Table 2-1, you see what default actions team members  and team owners have the ability to do when working in Teams. Some of these default  actions can also be modified by the team owner.  Note  Guests are people that are not part of an organization and do not have an  account in the organization’s Active Directory.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J.

Teams are  the container for channels and tabs. The first step to setting up a team is creating the  team itself; then, you can build upon the functionality by adding channels, tabs, and  connectors. Let’s get started!

ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Creating a Team To create a team    1.  Click Add team, located on the bottom left in the Teams app, as   seen in Figure 2-1.    2.  Click the Create team button.    3.  Enter a team name, description, and privacy settings.    4.  Add team members. A person’s name, distribution list, or mail-  enabled security group can be selected.  Figure 2-1.  Creating a team  13   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Be sure to name your team something meaningful. Although it is optional, it is   recommended to enter a description for the team. As more and more teams are added, a  description helps people in the organization determine which public team they should join.  You also need to decide on the privacy for the new team. If you don’t change the   setting, it defaults to private. This means that only team owners can add team members.  There is also the option to make a team public, which means that anyone in the  organization that has a Microsoft Teams license can join.  Note  it is important to make sure that a team with the name that you plan to use  does not already exist. nothing stops you from creating a name that is the same as  another team; however, doing so can create confusion and other issues for your users.  Another option is to create a team from an existing Office 365 group. When creating a  new team, first click the link at the bottom of the window that says Join or create a team.  Next, click the Create a team button. A window will then appear with a link to select titled  Create a team from an existing Office 365 group. You are given a list of groups you are the  owner of to choose from. Once you select the group, you can create the team. Everyone  that is part of the group is added as members of the team.  Note  teams can be reordered in the left navigation by dragging and dropping them  where you want them. the channels that are part of the team are moved with it.   Managing a Team When you create a new team, there are only a limited number of options available to  configure its settings. Much of this is done by using the Manage team option. Within this  area of a team, you have the option to change the overall settings for everyone on the  team. This includes setting the overall permissions for what internal and guest users can  do. You can also determine whether @mentions and fun stuff like emojis or animated  GIFs can be used, and change the team picture  icon .  14   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Let’s review how to add a team picture.    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name, and then select   Manage team.    2.  Select the Settings tab, and then select the team picture. Expand  the section. Click the Change picture link and select the picture.  In the pop-up box, locate the image that you want to use.     3.  Click the Save button.   Editing a Team Situations may arise when there is a need to change the name or description of a team,  such as an organizational change, another team in your organization with the same  name, or team member feedback.  To edit a team name    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name, and then select   Edit team, as seen in Figure 2-2.    2.  Change the team name, description, and privacy settings as desired.    3.  Click the Done button.  Figure 2-2.  Editing a team name, privacy setting, or description  15    WorkinG in tEAMs  ChAptEr 2   Adding Team Members Team owners have the ability to add team members to both private and public teams.  To add team members    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the name, and then select    Add members, as seen in Figure 2-3.    2.  Begin typing the name of the person, distribution list, or    mail-enabled security group that you wish to add to the team.    3.  Click Add.  to the team.  The people that you add will receive a notification email that they have been added   Figure 2-3.  Adding team members   Deleting a Team When a team is deleted, all the channels, chat, files, and the Office 365 group is  deleted. When the team is deleted, it is held in the tenant’s “recycle bin” in Azure  Active Directory  AAD  for 30 days and referred to as being in a “soft-delete” status.  During this time, the team can be restored using PowerShell, which requires the  assistance of an administrator. It can take up to 24 hours for a deleted team to reappear   16   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  after being restored. After 30 days have passed without being restored, however, the  team is permanently deleted in the environment and cannot be recovered by anyone,  including Microsoft. To delete a team    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name, and then select   Delete the team, as seen in Figure 2-4.    2.  Click the box stating that you understand that everything is   deleted.    3.  Click the Delete team button.  in some cases, office 365 Groups are used for purposes outside of Microsoft   Note  teams. there is no way to delete the team and keep the group for other purposes.  Figure 2-4.  Deleting a team  17   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Channels Channels within a team provide a means to separate content and conversations for  different projects, subjects, organizations, or disciplines. One organization we worked  with created a separate team for every IT project. Within those teams, they created  channels for different work functions on the project, such as development, quality  assurance, and project management.  When viewing teams, the channels fall underneath them in the application   navigation. Every person that is part of a team can access every channel, as in the  example shown in Figure 2-5.  it is not possible to make a channel have a different membership than the   Note  team it is part of. Members of a team can view all content within every channel.  Microsoft might add a feature at some point to allow securing channels to certain  users; however, it was not available when writing this book.  Figure 2-5.  A team with channels in the left navigation   Adding a Channel By default, every person that is part of a team can create a channel for that team.  Whenever a team is created, it automatically comes with a General channel. This  channel should be used for team conversations and content related to the overall goals  and objectives. When there is a need to collaborate and discuss something more specific,   18   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  it is recommended to create a new channel. Before creating a channel, it is important  to make sure that there is not already a channel being used for your planned topic. In  Chapter 6, we discuss appropriate reasons to create a channel.  To add a channel    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name, and then select   Add channel, as seen in Figure 2-6.    2.  Provide a name and a description for the channel.  Figure 2-6.  Adding a channel  When prompted to provide a name, be sure to name your channel something  meaningful. Although it is optional, it is recommended to enter a description for  the channel. As a team grows and more channels are added, descriptions help team  members determine where they should have conversations and collaborate. A  meaningful channel name and description can also avoid duplication of channels. If the  name is unrecognizable and there is no description, another team member may create a  channel that contains similar content and conversations.  19    WorkinG in tEAMs ChAptEr 2   Editing a Channel As the content and conversations evolve within a channel, there may be a need to  change the name or description of the channel.  To edit the channel name or description    1.  Click the ellipse  …  next to the channel name, and then click    Edit this channel.    2.  Change the channel name or description.    3.  Click Save.   Deleting a Channel While an organization goes through the process of adopting Microsoft Teams, the need to  delete a channel is bound to come up. Since any member of a team can create a channel  by default, it is likely that someone will accidently create a channel or experiment with  creating one without actually needing the channel. For example, a channel may be  created for a topic that already has an active channel. In this case, the channel with the  least amount of content should be deleted. Another circumstance that leads to deletion  is when the channel limit is reached. There can only be as many as 200 channels for  each team. For most teams, 200 channels should be more than enough, but if the limit is  approaching, it may be necessary to delete channels that are not being used often or at all.  When a channel is deleted, all conversations and tabs are deleted along with the   channel. The channel can be restored, but it cannot be re-created with the same name  as a blank slate. What this means is that you can restore a channel you deleted but you  cannot reuse the name of a channel you deleted again later.  To delete a channel    1.  Click the ellipse  …  next to the channel name, and then click   Delete this channel.    2.  Click the Delete button, as seen in Figure 2-7.  When you delete a channel, you are provided a link to the folder where channel   files are located. Since the files are stored in SharePoint, they are not deleted when the  channel is deleted.  20   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-7.  File link when deleting a channel  To delete channel files    1.  Navigate to the General channel and select the Files tab.    2.  Click Open in SharePoint. This opens the team document library   in your Internet browser showing a view of the channel folder.    3.  Click Documents to the left of the channel name.    4.  Click the check mark to the left of the channel name folder, and   then click Delete.   Restoring a Channel If a deleted channel needs to be restored, this can be done quickly with the restore  channel functionality.  To restore a channel  Manage team.    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name, and then select     2.  Select the Channels tab. If any channels have been deleted, they   show up in the deleted section.    3.  Click Restore.   Channel Email Every channel comes with an email address. When the channel is emailed, it creates a  new conversation thread in Teams. The email address of the person that emailed the  channel is shown at the top of the conversation. The subject of the email appears in  bold letters; this is followed by the email body. There is also a link to the original email,   21   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  which is accessible to anyone in the organization but not external guests. When that  link is clicked, it opens the email in Outlook. If the user is not logged in to Outlook, they  are prompted to do so. All email messages are saved in a subfolder called Emails in the  channel folder.  This channel email functionality is meant to deter important messages from being   lost in endless email threads. Often, people miss information when someone forgets  to Reply All when responding to an email, or forwards it to someone else. The channel  email helps avoid these blunders. Additionally, when new team members come aboard,  it is much easier to get them up to speed when they can read through conversations in a  channel.  To get the channel email address    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the channel name, and then   click Get email address.    2.  Click the Copy button, as seen in Figure 2-8.  Figure 2-8.  Channel email address  The email address is displayed along with links to advanced settings and to remove   the email address. The email address is generated by the system and cannot be changed.  The Copy button can quickly capture the email address to paste into an email.  You can control who can send an email to the channel email address by clicking   the advanced settings link. By default, anyone—even people who are not a member of  the team or the organization—can send an email to a channel email address. You can  choose to have only team members able to email the channel email address, or to have  emails only sent from certain domains. Examples of email domains are @hotmail.com,  @gmail.com, @noteworthytt.com, and @melihubb.com.  If the Remove email address button is clicked, the email address is disabled. If   anyone tries to email the channel once an email address is removed, they will receive a  delivery failure.  22   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Note  if the channel email address is removed, it cannot be recovered. only  remove the email if you are absolutely sure you do not want the channel email  address functionality.   Channel Link In some instances, you may want to refer a channel to someone that hasn’t yet adopted  Microsoft Teams and doesn’t know what a channel is or how to find one. Also, members  of an organization may be part of several teams, and each team may have many  channels. In this case, you can simply provide a team member a link to the channel, and  they can paste it into an Internet browser. They are then prompted to open the channel  in the Teams app, if they have it installed, or they can view the channel within the  browser. If someone who is not a member of the team tries to use the link, they will not  be able to access the channel.  To get the channel link    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the channel name, and then   click Get a link to the channel.    2.  Click the Copy button, as seen in Figure 2-9.  Figure 2-9.  Channel link  23    WorkinG in tEAMs  ChAptEr 2   Favoriting a Channel To keep up with the conversations and content in a channel, team members have the  ability to favorite and follow channels. When a channel is favorited, the member sees the  channel name in the list under the team name. If a channel is not favorited, the member  needs to click more channels underneath the last favorited channel in the list to view  it. When a channel is @mentioned in a conversation, all members that have it favorited  receive a notification. @mentions is discussed in Chapter 3. By default, when a member  is added to a team, the five most active channels are automatically favorited. If there are  fewer than five channels, any new channels are automatically added as favorites when  they are created, until there are five.  To favorite a channel    1.  Click the arrow next to more channels underneath the team   name, as seen in Figure 2-10.    2.  Click the star to the right of the channel name.  Figure 2-10.  Favoriting a channel   Following a Channel When a channel is followed, the member receives a notification whenever a new  conversation message is added. There is also an activity feed in which members can  view all recent conversations in the channels they are following. It is recommended that  a member only follow the channels that have the most importance to them. Depending  on how active a channel is, a lot of notifications may be sent out. If a member follows  too many channels, they may begin to ignore the notifications all together, which render  them useless.  24   To follow a channel    1.  Click the ellipse  …  next to the channel name, and then click   Follow this channel, as seen in Figure 2-11.  ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-11.  Following a channel  Note  the activity feed shows team members all activity of channels they follow  as well as mentions of them or any team or channel they are part of. it shows  them replies to their conversation messages and likes of the message. All saved  conversation messages are also shown. More about mentions and liking messages  can be found in Chapter 3.   Managing Channels There is a way to view and manage all channels for a team in one view. You can see the  channel names and descriptions along with the number of people that follow the channel  as seen in Figure 2-12. You can also see the date that the channel had its last activity. If the  last activity occurred on the current day, you can see how many hours ago the activity was.    1.  Click the ellipse  …  next to the team name, and then click   To manage channels  Manage team.    2.  Click Channels.  25   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-12.  Managing channels   Tabs Tabs make the customizable workspace within Microsoft Teams possible. Tabs are  containers within a team’s channels that hold content connected to a cloud-based  service, such as what’s seen in Figure 2-13. Files, websites, SharePoint lists and libraries,  Planner tasks, Power BI reports, and even third-party cloud-based tools can be viewed  and worked on in tabs. Every channel has its own set of tabs that can be configured.  There are three tabs that come automatically with every channel: Conversations, Files,  and Wiki. The Wiki tab can be deleted, but the Conversations and Files tabs cannot be  deleted because they are part of core Microsoft Teams functionality.  Note  if you want to focus on working in just one tab, you can expand and view it  without the teams and channels list on the left part of the app or the tabs and team  name at the top of the app.  Figure 2-13.  Tabs  26   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Conversations Tab Every channel within a team has a separate Conversations tab. The conversations that  occur in the channels cannot be viewed together. In other words, you cannot view all  team conversations from every channel in one view. Figure 2-14 provides an example.  Conversations are discussed further in Chapter 3.  Figure 2-14.  Conversations tab   Files Tab The Files tab is where documents and other files are uploaded for team members to  collaborate and share. An example of this is shown in Figure 2-15.  Files should only be added if they pertain to the channel topic. The Files tab should not  be used as a place to store personal files. It is different from the Conversations tab in that all  the files that are uploaded in the separate channel tabs live in one SharePoint document  library for the team. Every channel gets a folder in the document library. When you click the  Files tab in a channel, you get a view of the files in the Channel folder. The fields displayed are  File type, Name, Modified, and Modified by. The modified field shows the date that the file  was last changed. If this is within the current day, it shows the number of hours ago that the  file was changed. The Modified by field shows which team member last changed the file.  27   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs    2.  Select the file or files that you want to upload.    1.  Click the document, which highlights it in blue.  Figure 2-15.  Files tab   Uploading Files To upload a file to the Files tab    1.  Click Upload.    3.  Click Open.   Deleting Files To delete a file from the Files tab    2.  Click Delete.    3.  Click Confirm.  28  Note  When a file is removed from the Files tab, it is moved to the sharepoint  recycle bin.   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Downloading Files To download a file from the Files tab    1.  Click the document, which highlights it in blue.    2.  Click Download. The downloaded files folder opens.    3.  Select the file, and then click Open.   Wiki Tab The Wiki tab as seen in Figure 2-16 quickly captures ideas and information on one  central page per channel. The Wiki tab is comprised of pages and sections. When you  add pages, they are displayed in a navigation pane on the left. When sections are added  to a page, they appear in the navigation underneath the page that they are a part of, thus  creating a table of contents–like functionality.  Figure 2-16.  The Wiki tab in a team displaying a conversation  29   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Organizations can use the wiki page to present information, such as a checklist or   the steps of a process. If you create a section for each checklist item, team members can  use the built-in conversations functionality to discuss the process and provide feedback.  For example, if you create a wiki page for a checklist of things that need to happen when  a new employee joins a project, new team members can add comments and make  suggestions. All of this happens within the wiki page. The conversations appear within  the wiki page, but they are also added under a channel’s Conversations tab for visibility.  A conversation message includes a link that brings team members to the wiki page. If  someone responds to a conversation in the Conversations tab, it is also displayed in  the conversation in the wiki section associated with it. There is also the ability to add  additional wiki tabs to a channel.  On the back end, the wiki content is stored in the same SharePoint site collection   that is created when you create a team. First, all the wiki content for that channel is  placed in a document library titled Teams Wiki Data  see Figure 2-17 . This folder is  automatically created by the system when you create your first wiki page.  Figure 2-17.  The Teams Wiki Data document library within your SharePoint site  collection  Within the Teams Wiki Data folder, there is another subfolder for each channel.   Inside of each of these subfolders are the system files for each wiki. Each wiki page is  stored as a .mht file, making it best to only edit wikis within Microsoft Teams and not via  the SharePoint document library.  30   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Adding a Tab To create a tab  the channel.    1.  Click the plus sign that is located to the far right of the tabs area of     2.  Select the connector for the service that you want to connect to   and use in the tab, as seen in Figure 2-18.  The connector that you select determines the next step in adding the tab. Depending on   what you select, you are prompted to select a file or a work product, or to create a new one.  Figure 2-18.  Adding a tab  Note  For information to be secure when adding a website to a tab, the UrL  needs to start with https.  31    WorkinG in tEAMs  ChAptEr 2   Deleting a Tab To delete a tab    1.  Click the name of the tab that you want to delete.    2.  Click the drop-down arrow, and then select Remove, as seen in   Figure 2-19.    3.  Click Remove when prompted.  The tab is deleted, but that does not mean that the file or work product displayed is   deleted from the source.  Figure 2-19.  Removing a tab  Connectors Connectors are a gateway to cloud services that Microsoft Teams can interact with. The  connectors are contained within tabs in the channel. Microsoft Teams connects with  many Office 365 apps, such as Planner, Excel, and OneNote. Third-party services—such  as Trello, Twitter, GitHub, and Smartsheet—can also be connected. It is possible to create  custom connectors using a web hook. You can learn more about developing custom  connectors from Microsoft’s website.  if the team member who created a connector is removed from the team,   Note  the connector stops working until another teammate re-creates it.  To add a connector  Connectors.    1.  Click the ellipse  …  next to the channel name, and then click     2.  Search for the service of choice, and then click the Configure   button, as seen in Figure 2-20.    3.  Log in to the service.  32   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-20.  Adding a connector  It is important to remember that a connector is a connection to another service that   can read and write data to and from your organization. In a way, this a great benefit: you do  not have to leave the Microsoft Teams client. Your administrators might find it to be a data  or security risk, however. In the Office 365 administration center, you can disable or enable  each connector separately so that only the options vetted for your organization can be used.   Search Searching in Microsoft Teams is a bit basic, although there are some filtering options  available. If you are used to a rich, sortable, minutely refined search experience such as  what exists in SharePoint, unfortunately, you will not find that in Microsoft Teams yet.  You need to search to find the files that you work with, so let’s review the options that are  available and go over how to use them to best extent possible.  The search experience begins with a combined search and command bar, as seen   in Figure 2-21. It is rather self-explanatory: you just type what you are searching for. This  performs a broad search across all of your teams. The results are returned within one or  more of the following filtering categories:     Messages     People     Files  33   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-21.  The search experience in Microsoft Teams  The Messages category returns results from your private chats, channel   conversations that are posted for all to see within a team channel, conversations you  have with bots, and emails sent to a team.  It does not return the results from the wiki, meeting titles, or documents in your Files   tab, such as OneDrive for Business, Dropbox, or Google Drive.  The People category is used to find persons within your organization. If you want to   find data from a specific person, you want to use the Filter tab.  The Files tab returns Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote files, images, text  files, and PDFs. Teams returns the results of the search term, which appears within  the filename or within the body of text. It also searches within .zip files for contents  containing your search phrase.  Note  Content search allows you to search across most of the components of  teams, including Exchange, sharepoint, and oneDrive for Business. it is only  available to administrators using the office 365 administration center.  34   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   Using the Search Filter As teams and the amount of content grows larger, attempting to find content can be  difficult. To refine the search results, you can utilize the Filter tab  pane . The Filter tab  only appears in Messages and Files  there is no filter option for the People category . As  you can see in Figure 2-22, you can refine by team, file type, and or the person who last  worked on the file.  Figure 2-22.  The Filter tab in search alters, depending on which category you have  highlighted   Quick Commands and the Command Bar The command bar is combined with the search box. Quick commands are shortcuts   that perform an action or return some type of data. Quick commands start with   or   @ symbols.  35    WorkinG in tEAMs  ChAptEr 2   @commands @commands are a way to search within a specific context. If you are familiar with  searching in Google for a word within the title of a web result by using Title:MyWord,   the @command exemplifies a similar feature except within the context of a user  like   @mentioning someone on Twitter  or within the context of an installed app. By typing  the @ symbol, you receive a list of users and apps that you can use the @command with.  In Figure 2-23, we used the @Weather command.  Figure 2-23.  Using the @Weather command in the command bar  After selecting the @Weather command, the command bar then prefaces any search   you perform with the Weather app. You are now able to search for the weather in cities  across the world  see Figure 2-24 .  36   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-24.  Selecting a city to use with the @Weather command to return the  current weather for that city  if you use an @command for an app that you do not have installed, you are   Note  prompted to install the app.    commands Slash commands   commands , or shortcuts, in the command bar provide another way  to quickly perform a task or obtain data. At the time we write this book, there are less than  20 slash commands available to users. It is highly likely that this number will increase as  Microsoft Teams grows in popularity. The following is a list of available slash commands:                   activity: View a team member’s activity   available: Changes your team’s status to Available   away: Changes your team’s status to Away   busy: Changes your team’s status to Busy  37   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs   call: Initiate a call                                                       dnd: Changes your team’s status to Do Not Disturb   files: See your recent files   goto: Go to a certain team or channel   help: Get help  with Teams; not the “lie on the couch” kind    join: Join a team   keys: View keyboard shortcuts   mentions: See all of your mentions  Handy if your team’s channels  are really busy!    org: View an org chart  yours or someone else’s    saved: View your saved list   unread: See all of your unread activity   whatsnew: Check out what’s new in Teams   who: Ask Who  a new app that lets you search for people by name or  topic  a question  The following covers some of the more popular slash commands.    activity   activity helps you find data when you can’t remember exactly what a file is called, but  you do remember who worked on it last. It can also come in handy if someone left your  project, and you want to see what they were working on recently so that you can reassign  it to someone else.    dnd,  busy,  away,  available   dnd,  busy,  away, and  available offer quick and easy ways to change your notification  status. Although it may take a couple of seconds, these commands change the colored  icon next to your name to alert others of your availability. The  dnd command sets your  status to Do Not Disturb and automatically forwards calls to your voice mail. The other  three slash commands provide a visual indicator that indicates whether you are available  or not. These commands do not prevent someone from calling or messaging you the way  that the  dnd command does. 38   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs    who  The  who command triggers the Who Bot, which is used to find specific people  and  more detailed information about them  within your organization. If you have not used it  before, it prompts you to allow it to perform searches on your behalf. An example of this  experience is seen in Figure 2-25.  Figure 2-25.  The Who Bot asking for permission to search on your behalf  If for some reason more than one result returns, you are prompted to select the result   that you are searching for  see Figure 2-26 .  Figure 2-26.  Displays the results from the Who Bot if you receive more than one  result  39   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  After selecting the correct person that you want to inquire about, a card displays   more information about the user, as seen in Figure 2-27.  Figure 2-27.  A card with information about the person you are searching for  From here, you can find activity-based information, such as who the person works   with, their manager, and their peers. This can be helpful if the person is out on leave, for  example, and you need to find someone who is able to assist you with the responsibilities  this person normally has. It can also be used to learn the person’s level of management  before you engage in conversation with them, since there is usually an expectation of  treating higher-level executives in a formal manner.  There are many other slash commands available in Teams to accelerate your   workload. Feel free to experiment with them yourself.   Tips As we wrap up this chapter on how to work efficiently in Microsoft Teams, let’s discuss a  few quick tips on how to improve your working experience even further.   Keyboard Shortcuts First, let’s discuss keyboard shortcuts. You can see all of the available shortcuts by  pressing ALT+  on your keyboard. After doing so, you should see something similar to  what’s shown in Figure 2-28.  40   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Figure 2-28.  A listing of the shortcut keys available in Microsoft Teams  41   ChAptEr 2    WorkinG in tEAMs  Some of these keyboard shortcuts are available in Windows and some of them are   specific to Teams and Skype for Business. Feel free to experiment with them to see which  ones work best for you.   Ctrl+K  Adding a Link  Although there are keys to add attachments, animated GIFs, start a meeting, and change  the fonts in a conversation, there isn’t a button to add a hyperlink. By pressing Ctrl+K on  the keyboard, you can quickly add a link to the text you are typing. As seen in Figure 2- 29,  you can type the display text and the URL that the link goes to. We use this often by creating  statements such as, “Please find the document to review here.”  Figure 2-29.  Adding a link to a channel conversation by selecting Ctrl+K   Summary We have now reviewed the components inside a team that enable you to complete your  work. We have explored channels, tabs, and connectors. We investigated different ways  to retrieve data with search, @commands, and keyboard shortcuts. Now let’s continue  our journey by learning about the different ways to communicate within Teams.  42   CHAPTER 3  Communicating in Teams  Microsoft Teams offers a suite of communication tools that empower team members to  be engaged and collaborative with one another. In the modern world, team members are  on the go and often work from remote locations away from their team. Having reliable  virtual communication options is absolutely essential to drive productivity by working  together and making decisions. In this chapter, we’ll discuss voice, video, imagery, chat,  and other ways to communicate in Microsoft Teams.   Conversations Conversations occur within team channels. They provide a place where team members  can discuss topics and post messages in which everyone in the team can reply.  One of the biggest benefits of conversations is a reduction in email. Conversations   differ from traditional email in that they are all in one viewable area for all team  members. Email messages are stored within individual mail inboxes, which limits  visibility for team members. Oftentimes, someone sends out an email about a topic to  a group of people. Then, that email is replied to without including the entire group, or  forwarded to an individual and the group context is lost. This results in team members  being excluded from the series of emails and being left in the dark about key decisions  and discussions related to the topic.  One of the key values in using conversations is that it preserves your organizational   assets. In conversations, important information can be passed and decisions made  between team members. If all the team members leave the organization, the information  remains in the channel for you and others to view at a later time. When a new member  joins the organization, department, or project, they are able to get up to speed. Having  conversations stored in Microsoft Teams allows them to go to one place to read through  conversations and quickly get up to speed.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_3  43   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  To start a conversation    1.  Navigate to the Conversations tab of the channel of choice.    2.  At the bottom of the Conversations tab, use the text box to   type your message, and then click the arrow located on the  bottom-right of the text box.  It is possible to create conversation messages in some of the tabs.    Note  Click the tab name, and then the chat symbol on the right, as seen in Figure 3-1.  Figure 3-1.  Beginning a conversation within a tab   Mentioning a Team Member, Channel, or Team If you type the @ symbol followed by a team member’s name, a channel name, or a  team name, a list of names that start with the few letters you type will show up for you  to choose from. If you choose a person, they will receive a notification of the mention. If  you choose a channel, everyone who favorited the channel receives a notification. If you  choose a team, everyone who is part of the team receives a notification. This is a way to  let a team member, channel, or team know that a message is directed to them and that  they need to pay attention.   Liking a Message One way to acknowledge that you have read someone’s conversation message or that you  agree with them is to hit the Like button on their message. This is similar to Facebook’s  well-known Like functionality. The person who originally posted the conversation message  is notified that you liked it. You can unlike a conversation by clicking the same button.  To like messages    1.  Hover your mouse over the right corner of the message.    2.  Click the thumbs-up icon, which turns it blue  see Figure 3-2 .  44   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-2.  Liking a message   Saving a Conversation Message Conversation messages can be saved by hitting the Save button on a message. They can  be viewed later in a central location.  To save messages    1.  Hover your mouse over the right corner of the message.    2.  Click the Save icon, which turns it pink  see Figure 3-3 .  Figure 3-3.  Saving a message  To view saved messages    1.  Click your picture icon in the bottom-left corner of the Microsoft   Teams app.    2.  Click Saved, as seen in Figure 3-4.  45   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-4.  Viewing all saved messages   Chat Chat in Microsoft Teams provides a way to have a 1:1 or ad hoc group conversation that  provides immediate notification. If you utilized Skype for Business, you’ve experienced  chat capability. Chat provides immediate notification. It differs from conversations in  that if a team member is not following that channel, they will not be notified. Microsoft  Teams also offers group chat capability. When choosing who to send a chat message to,  you can choose individuals or groups.  In today’s modern work centers, information workers often don’t pay attention to  phone calls and other forms of distraction due to loss of productivity. With the mobile  app, chat can be used as a replacement for text messaging in scenarios where you may  not have a co-worker’s direct phone number. Team members can send a chat message  and the recipient will receive it within the mobile application. Chat improves real-time  communication by increasing productivity through enabling team members to hold  quick discussions and get answers to questions no matter if they are in the office or on  the go. Group chat improves productivity for teams by reducing meetings and meeting  times through allowing teams to quickly reach decision points and discuss issues and  tasks related to projects in real-time communication.  46   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  To send a chat message    1.  Click the chat icon located on the left in the Teams app.    2.  Click the new chat paper-and-pencil icon to the right of the    Search box.    3.  Enter the name s  or group that you want to message.    4.  Type your message in the text box, and then click the arrow at the   bottom right of the text box.  Everyone you sent the message to will receive a notification   Chat Message Formatting Options Expanding the compose box shows more options for the chat text. To expand the  compose box, click the symbol with the letter A and a paint brush below the text box, as  seen in Figure 3-5.  When you do this, the functions to change the text font, size, and color will appear, as  well as paragraph-formatting options, such as headings and bullets. The function to add  a hyperlink is also found when you expand the compose box.  Figure 3-5.  Additional message formatting options  47   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Note  to mark a chat message as important, click the exclamation mark  !   symbol in the expanded compose box. the team member that you send it to will  receive an email letting them know that they have received an important message.   Using Emojis Emojis allow team members to express emotions in chats and conversations. Emojis  deliver the Web 2.0 functionality that is found on popular social media platforms. They  enable organizations with a tool to inject personality into projects and express more  context. They feature various faces to let your teammates know how you feel about a  topic or message. If you are the manager of a project and reach a project milestone that  you are excited about, you can express this to your team members with an excited emoji.  If you miss a deadline, you can communicate this with a sad or embarrassed emoji. In  work-related scenarios such as a promotion party for a team member or planning a  happy hour event, emojis enable personality-based communication to add additional  feeling to a project or task being managed in Microsoft Teams. If you don’t know what a  particular emoji means, you can place your cursor over the emoji to see its meaning, or  you can use the search box. Emojis really let a person’s personality be reflected within  their words.  To add an emoji to a chat or conversation message    1.  Click the smiley face icon below the text box when adding a new   chat or conversation message.    2.  Either scroll through the emoji faces or use the search box to find   an emotion, as seen in Figure 3-6.  48   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-6.  Adding emojis to a message   Stickers Stickers are editable images that can be sent in chat and conversation messages.  Microsoft Teams comes with a wide variety of sticker templates. Stickers are a great way  to have fun with your team. Teams comes with images that you can edit with text to  express emotions with a picture and customized message.  To add a sticker to a chat or conversation message    1.  Click the square smiley sticker icon below the text box when   adding a new chat or conversation message, as seen in Figure 3-7.    2.  Either scroll through the stickers or use the search box.    3.  Enter any desired text, and then click the Done button.  49   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-7.  Adding stickers to a message   GIFs GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, is a type of file format that supports  animated images. GIFs are similar to stickers but the animation adds extra excitement  and effect. You cannot add words to GIFs like you can with stickers, though. Microsoft  Teams comes with many GIFs that can be used in chat and conversation messages.  To add a GIF to a chat or conversation message    1.  Click the GIF icon below the text box when adding a new chat or     2.  Either scroll through the GIFs or use the search box, as seen in   conversation message.  Figure 3-8.    3.  Click the GIF of choice.  50   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-8.  Adding GIFs to a message   Searching for a Message You can search for old messages from your chat list or channel conversations. Use the  search bar to enter the person’s name that messaged you, or use key words from the  message. You can filter your search results based on the subject, author, and date of the  message.  51   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams   Voice Calls Sometimes there is no time to type a chat message to a team member, or the context  of the communication requires speaking. Voice calls are perfect for this situation. If  you have ever used Skype for Business in the workplace, you will find the functionality  very similar. You can voice call anyone within your organization, even if they are not a  member of any of your teams. If your organization has an Enterprise Voice license, you  have the ability to call external phone numbers as well.   To make a voice call    1.  Click the chat icon located on the left in the Microsoft Teams app.    2.  Either select the person you want to call from your recent list or   use the search box to find them. You can create a new chat to  make the call by following the previous instructions.    3.  Click the phone icon located on the top right of the chat message,  as seen in Figure 3-9. You will then be brought to the call screen as  seen in Figure 3-10.    4.  The person is notified with a ringing that they are receiving a   Teams call. If they answer, the call begins; if not, they are notified  that they have a missed call.  Figure 3-9.  Making a voice call  52   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams  Figure 3-10.  Calling a team member   Video Calls Video calling is the most personal method of communication within Teams because  you can both see and hear the person. With Teams video calls, the face of each person  fills the entire screen, making it feel as if you are having a face-to-face conversation. You  can also send chat messages while video calling a team member in case you are having  trouble hearing them or want to send a link to a work product.  To make a video call    1.  Click the chat icon located on the left in the Teams app.    2.  Either select the person you want to video call with from your   recent list or use the search box to find them. You can create a new  chat to make the video call by following the previous instructions.    3.  Click the video camera icon located on the top right of the chat   message, as seen in Figure 3-11.  53   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams    4.  The person is notified with a ringing that they are receiving a   Teams video call, as seen in Figure 3-12. If they answer, the call  begins; if not, they are notified that they have a missed call.  Figure 3-11.  Making a video call  Figure 3-12.  Video calling a team member  54   Chapter 3    CommunICatIng In teams   Choosing the Right Form of Communication Microsoft Teams is a virtual workplace that addresses many forms of office  communication. You can have one-on-one communication with a team member by  using chat. The topics discussed via chat are similar to discussions one would have when  stopping by a team member’s office or running into them in the break area. They are  informal and usually have quick response times. You can see when your team members  are available, away, or offline based on the color circle on the bottom right of their profile  picture. Green means available, yellow is away, red means busy, and no color means  they are offline.  Group chat is similar; it is for ad hoc discussions with a group of teammates. Group  chat is one way to effectively reduce the need for formal meetings, which can be a waste  of time. With group chats, you can convey a message quickly to multiple team members.  You can also utilize audio and video calling to see and hear your teammates, which  makes it more personal. If you want to post a message that all team members can reply  to on their own schedule, you should utilize conversations.   Summary In this chapter, we explored the many options in which you can communicate with  other Microsoft Teams users. We discussed how to create conversations, start voice  and video calls, add emojis and images, and how to chat. Choosing the right form of  communication in Microsoft Teams is important to make sure that you’re conveying  your messages and ideas in the best manner. Now, let’s move on to the different  methods of meeting with others using Microsoft Teams.  55   CHAPTER 4  Meetings in Teams  There has been a lot of discussion and research in the business world over the last  several years about the time, money, and resources wasted on meetings. Group chat  and conversations in Microsoft Teams offer practical ways to discuss topics and make  decisions without taking an hour or more out of several team members’ day to be in  a meeting together. There are situations, however, in which meetings are necessary.  Whether you are meeting to discuss status updates, do a project code review, refine a  sales plan, or for any other business reason, Microsoft Teams has a way to bring you  together.  There are three different meeting experiences within Microsoft Teams: private,   channel, and meet now. Not only does Microsoft Teams offer different meeting  experiences, there are a few different ways to both schedule and join meetings. A  plethora of meeting features allow for a smooth and customizable experience. Video,  voice chat, screen sharing, and chat within the meeting offer a wide range of choices for  communication style. In this chapter, we discuss the meeting options in Microsoft Teams  as well as how to schedule, join, and participate in them.   Private Meetings The first type of meeting that we discuss is the most traditional in that it resembles  an Outlook meeting, which is widely used. Private meetings can only be attended by  team members that have been invited. They can be between two individuals, or many  people. Meetings can be scheduled directly through the Microsoft Teams app or through  Outlook using an add-in. If you have Microsoft Teams and either Office 2013 or Office  2016 installed on your device, the add-in shows up in Outlook automatically.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_4  57    Meetings in teaMs  Chapter 4   Scheduling Private Meetings To schedule a meeting through the Microsoft Teams app    1.  Click the meetings icon located on the left in the Microsoft Teams   app, as seen in Figure 4-1.    2.  Click the Schedule a meeting button.    3.  Fill out the title, start date and time, and end date and time, at a   minimum.    4.   In the Invite people field, select at least one person. Begin typing  their name in the field, and then select them from the drop-down  menu.    5.  Click the Schedule a meeting button.  Figure 4-1.  Scheduling a meeting  58   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  To schedule a meeting through the Outlook add-in    1.   In the Outlook calendar, click the New Teams Meeting icon from  the top ribbon, as seen in Figure 4-2.    2.  Enter the meeting subject, start time, and end time.    3.  Click the Send button.  Everyone invited will receive an email containing a link to join the meeting in Teams. When using the Outlook add-in to schedule a Microsoft Teams meeting, you can also   click New Meeting, and then select Teams Meeting. This is just a different path to get to  the same destination in scheduling your meeting.  Figure 4-2.  Scheduling a meeting using the Outlook add-in  59    Meetings in teaMs  Chapter 4   Using the Scheduling Assistant When scheduling a meeting, the scheduling assistant  see Figure 4-3  lets you see when  attendees are busy or free during the proposed meeting time.  To use the scheduling assistant    1.  Click the Scheduling assistant link below the end time field.    2.  Decide when to hold the meeting based on the attendee’s   availability.    3.  Click Schedule Meeting or Update, depending on if you are   creating a new meeting or updating an existing one.  Figure 4-3.  Using the scheduling assistant   Inviting Unauthenticated Guests to Meetings Teams provides a means to schedule a private meeting and invite someone that is  completely outside of your organization and may not even have the Microsoft Teams app  installed on their device  see Figure 4-4 . The person just needs a valid email address  to be invited to the private Microsoft Teams meeting and receive information on the  meeting and how to join it. The guest is prompted to enter their name when they click  the link to join the meeting  although guests can also join anonymously . Guests that do  not have the Microsoft Teams app are not able to share their screen.  Holding virtual meetings with people from outside an organization is common. This   meeting feature is useful when you need to have meetings with a client, stakeholder,  contractor, vendor, or anyone that does not have an Office 365 account with your  organization.  60   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-4.  Unauthenticated guest joining a meeting   Joining Private Meetings To join a meeting through the Teams app    1.  Click the meetings icon located to the left of the Teams app, as   seen in Figure 4-5. Any upcoming meetings you are scheduled for  are shown in the Agenda section    2.  Click the meeting that you wish to join, and then either click the   Join button to the right of the meeting name or the Join Microsoft  Teams Meeting link located in the meeting invite.  61   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-5.  Joining private meetings from the Teams app  To join a meeting through the Outlook add-in    1.   In the Outlook calendar, click the meeting to open the invite.    2.  Click Join Microsoft Teams Meeting.   Channel Meetings Channel meetings  see Figure 4-6  are scheduled meetings that occur in a team’s  channel, based on the topic. Channel meetings offer many benefits. One benefit is that  they make it possible to quickly invite everyone from a team to a meeting. Another  benefit is that information about the meeting is saved in the channel as an organizational  asset. While working in Teams, it is obvious to team members that a meeting is occurring  in a channel: a camera icon appears to the right of the channel name. In the channel  conversations, a large message is posted when the meeting starts. The message shows   62   each person who has joined the meeting by displaying their profile pictures in a small  circle in the top right of the message. At the bottom of the meeting message, you see the  chat. Additionally, a timer shows how long the meeting has been taking place.  Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-6.  Channel meeting   Scheduling Channel Meetings Channel meetings can only be scheduled through the Microsoft Teams app  not with  the Outlook add-in . All team members receive an email notification when a channel  meeting is scheduled.  Note  after a meeting completes, the total time of the meeting, the meeting  attendees, and the chat are saved in the channel automatically.  To schedule a channel meeting    1.  Click the meetings icon located on the left in the Microsoft Teams   app.  minimum.    2.  Click the Schedule a meeting button.    3.  Fill out the title, start date and time, and end date and time, at a     4.  Pick a channel from the Select a channel to meet in drop-down   menu, as seen in Figure 4-7.    5.  Click the Schedule a meeting button.  63   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-7.  Scheduling a channel meeting   Joining a Meeting by Audio Conference Participants in Microsoft Teams can join meetings by phone while they are on the go. This  is useful when a meeting participant does not have access to the internet. Participants  that have this feature receive dial-in instructions in the Teams meeting invite.  Note  Only meeting participants that have the audio conferencing feature enabled  in Office 365 receive dial-in instructions.   Meeting Agenda The meeting agenda is a central location that shows you all the upcoming private and  channel meetings that you are invited to. By default, you see all the meetings for the  week. If you click the blocked icon located in the top-right corner of the agenda  see  Figure 4-8 , you can change the view to only show meetings for the day.  64   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-8.  Meeting agenda   Meet Now Meetings Meet Now meetings allow spontaneous meetings with all team members. Meet Now  meetings are a great way to quickly share a message or bring a team together in an  urgent situation. They are similar to channel meetings in that they are initiated and  take place within a channel. When a Meet Now meeting is started, a conversation  message is added to the channel that looks the same as it does for channel meetings.  The meeting name, attendees, elapsed meeting time, and chat messages are all part  of the Meet Now meeting conversation messages. The camera icon to the right of the  channel name and the team members’ names show that a meeting is happening. One  thing different about Meet Now meetings is that the video option is on for the person  who initiates the meeting.  65   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  To start a Meet Now meeting    1.  Click the camera icon located below the text box in the   conversations tab of the channel that you want to hold the  meeting in  see Figure 4-9 .    2.  Enter a subject and click the Meet now button.  Figure 4-9.  Starting a Meet Now meeting  Note  entering a subject for a Meet now meeting is optional, but it is  recommended so that team members know the purpose of the meeting.   Meeting Controls for Participants Participants in Microsoft Teams meetings have control over how they participate in a  meeting and what they share. To get the most out of meetings, use of video and voice are  recommended. However, participants can choose whether or not they show themselves  in a video or use voice. Participants can also choose to share their screen. Microsoft  Teams has a feature that allows you to choose which window on your desktop that you  want to share, in case you don’t want people to see your email or anything else that is  personal. The controls for participants are in the middle of the meeting screen, as seen in  Figure 4-10. You do not see the controls until you move your mouse into that general area.  66   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-10.  Participant meeting controls   Muting the Mic When a participant has their mic open, and there is background noise, it can be very  distracting for everyone in the meeting. It is best practice to keep the mic muted unless  you are speaking. If you are speaking and no one is responding to you, check your mic  because you may have forgotten to unmute yourself!  To mute the mic    1.  Move the mouse to the middle area of the meeting screen.    2.  Click the microphone icon.  To unmute, follow the same instructions. The microphone icon has a slash going   through it when muted, as seen in Figure 4-11.  67   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-11.  Muting the mic   Disabling Video Communicating with other meeting participants is best with video. When people can see  your expressions along with hearing you speak, they are the most likely to understand  your message. For the times that you do not want others to see you, such as when you  aren’t in a professional meeting location or you are multitasking, video can easily be  disabled.  To disable the video    1.  Move your mouse to the middle area of the meeting screen.    2.  Click the video camera icon, as seen in Figure 4-12.  To turn the video back on, follow the same instructions. If you have a profile picture,   it will show when you talk  instead of video .  68   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-12.  Disabling the Video   Screen Sharing Screen sharing is an extremely valuable feature. Common uses of screen sharing are  to show presentation slides or to walk participants through some process or work tool.  All participants can share their screen except unauthenticated guests not using the  Microsoft Teams app.  To screen share    1.  Move your mouse to the middle area of the meeting screen.    2.  Click the computer screen icon, as seen in Figure 4-13.    3.  Choose whether you want to share your desktop or an app. Click   the screen or app of choice.  To end screen sharing, click the computer screen icon again.  69   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-13.  Screen sharing   Giving Control of the Screen When a meeting participant is sharing their screen, another participant may need to take  control of their screen or application to demonstrate something. A participant can both  give control of their screen and request control.  To give control of the screen    1.  Click the Give control drop-down menu located on the top center   of the screen while screen sharing.    2.  Select the person’s name that you want to give control to.   Multitasking in Teams Microsoft Teams makes it possible to continue working within the app while also  participating in a meeting. Simply click out of the meeting anywhere within the  Microsoft Teams application, and the meeting will shrink to a small window located  on the top left of the app. To return to the meeting in a full window, click the small  meeting window.  70   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs   Hanging Up a Meeting To hang up a meeting    1.  Move your mouse to the middle area of the meeting screen.    2.  Click the red phone icon, as seen in Figure 4-14.  Figure 4-14.  Hanging up a meeting   Meeting Controls for Organizers Meeting organizers have controls in place that allow them to make sure that the meeting  runs smoothly. Organizers can admit participants into the meeting from the lobby, mute  participants, and remove participants.   Admitting Participants from the Lobby One of the jobs of the meeting organizer is to admit authenticated guests that have  joined the meeting from the lobby. Depending on the subject matter of the meeting, it  may be very important to carefully review the names of the guests waiting in the lobby.  If something sensitive is being discussed, you do not want someone that should not be  attending to get into the meeting.  71   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  To admit a participant from the lobby    1.  Click the check mark to the right of the guest’s name, as seen in     2.  Clicking the X to the right of the person’s name rejects the person   Figure 4-15.  from joining the meeting.  Figure 4-15.  Admitting participants from the lobby   Muting Participants At times, a participant may not realize that they have their mic open, or they may have  stepped away from their desk. If your meeting is being disrupted by background noise  or someone having a conversation outside of the meeting, the organizer can mute  participants. You will know who is making the noise because the meeting tells you who is  currently speaking. There is also the option to mute all participants. This is an especially  useful feature when there are a large number of attendees in a meeting.  To mute a participant    1.  Click the ellipse  ...  to the right of the participant’s name in the   list of people currently in the meeting.    2.  Click Mute participant, as seen in Figure 4-16.  72   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-16.  Muting a participant  The participant will be able to unmute their mic when they want to speak again, but   the current distraction is fixed.  Note  to mute all participants, click the Mute all link located above the list of  people currently in the meeting, as seen in Figure 4-17.  Figure 4-17.  Muting all participants   Removing Participants At times, a participant may be too disruptive or is invited in error. In these situations, the  meeting organizer can remove a participant.  To mute a participant    1.  Click the ellipse  ...  to the right of the participant’s name in the   list of people currently in the meeting.    2.  Click Remove participant, as seen in Figure 4-18.  73   Chapter 4    Meetings in teaMs  Figure 4-18.  Removing a participant   Summary In this chapter, we walked through the multiple ways to hold meetings in Teams, as well  as the different meeting controls for meeting organizers and participants. The meeting  features in Teams are very helpful for driving productivity, especially for teams that are  not able to hold meetings in person. When members of an organization realize the value  of holding meetings using Microsoft Teams, it helps drive user adoption of the product.  More about user adoption of Microsoft Teams is covered in the next chapter.  74   CHAPTER 5  User Adoption in Teams  Have you seen eyes rolling and heard the moaning when a memo is sent out telling you  and your teammates of a new intranet that they will need to use? Have you felt annoyed  when you are told by leadership that there is a change to the performance review process  and system, which is the third change in two years? If you ask information technology  leaders what the biggest challenges of implementing new software are, user adoption  will be at the top of the list.  User adoption is when the members of an organization accept and use a new   software or tool that has been introduced to their work environment to its fullest extent.  Organizations struggle with this for a variety of reasons. People simply do not like to  change their work habits once they are a rhythm, even if it will save them time and make  their life easier in the long run. This is especially true when they have a high workload  or stress at work. It is difficult to switch gears and use a new software or tool when  organization members are struggling to meet deadlines or have conflicting priorities.  Also, there is often a lack of trust in new software or tools. If an organization has suffered  through failed rollouts of software in the past, end users become disenchanted when  they hear of something new. This is especially true if many people lost work and or time,  or if this is the perception.  Training can also be an issue in user adoption. Well-intentioned organization   members may try to adopt a new software or tool but struggle with how to use it  properly. If they can’t quickly resolve it, they are likely to go back to old tools or to find  work-arounds that do not involve the new software.  Note  User adoption planning is just as important as implementation planning, so  do not cut corners. It will not matter how smoothly the technical implementation of  Microsoft Teams goes if there is weak user adoption.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_5  75   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Many IT professionals have watched these user adoption issues plague their   collaboration software rollouts for years. Many lessons have been learned that can  be drawn upon to ensure that organizations are successful with Microsoft Teams  user adoption.   When to Use What for Collaboration Yammer an Office 365 tool for enterprise-wide social networking and sharing information.  Another relatively new service from Microsoft is Office 365 Groups. Office 365 Groups  provide a shared workspace that includes email, conversations, files, and events in which  members of a group can collaborate and get work completed via the Outlook client. The  important distinction to make here is that Microsoft Teams is a platform with even more  features, although in some ways they are connected in the background.  There are many reasons to use Microsoft Teams. Although a single team can have  up to 2,500 members, we do not recommend using Microsoft Teams solely for sharing  organizational-level announcements and information. Microsoft Teams is not meant to  replace an organization’s intranet. Knowing when to use which tool can sometimes be  a bit confusing. To help guide you a bit more, Figure 5-1 is based on Microsoft’s “inner  circle outer circle” reference.  Figure 5-1.  Microsoft’s recommendation of when to select which  collaboration tool  76   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs   Real-World Use Cases The following are some examples of how Microsoft Teams can be used to maximize  the benefits the app has to offer. It is important to remember that every organization  is different, and Microsoft Teams may fit into the information technology strategy in  various ways.   Use Case 1: Coordinating a New Initiative A nonprofit organization is starting a new initiative to educate children about healthy  eating in impoverished schools. It creates a private team and adds everyone that is  working on the initiative as team members. A channel is added for each of the four  schools the initiative is targeting. Within those channels, the team members discuss  their lessons plans, creation of materials, scheduling, and other topics related to the  particular school. They use the documents tab in these channels to store the customized  learning materials and forms that they created for each school. The team members that  are assigned to each school favorite and follow the channel for that particular school  to make sure that they stay up-to-date on all channel activities. The General channel  is used to discuss topics that apply to the overall initiative, such as funding and team  assignments. A tab is set up showing a Power BI chart displaying metrics on the number  of students that have participated in the initiative from each school. The wiki outlines  the protocols that should be followed when team members arrive at a school. Team  members often use group chat messages to quickly reach a consensus about planning  decisions. A sample of the channel structure is seen in Figure 5-2.  Figure 5-2.  Use Case 1: Coordinating a project with channels  77    User adopTIon In TeaMs  ChapTer 5   Use Case 2: Departmental Collaboration The Human Resources department of a mid-sized company has a private team created  for them by the IT department. Channels are set up for the different functions and  activities of the department, such as recruitment, benefits, payroll, and training.  The General channel contains a tab for the benefits service that the whole team   uses regularly in their work day. The recruitment channel has tabs for a SharePoint list  where recruitment possibilities are stored, as well as a tab containing a Microsoft Word  document that is regularly referred to for guidance when cold-calling recruits. The  training channel is primarily used to discuss the training materials being developed.  Team members use a tab containing a Microsoft Excel document that the   organization uses to track employees’ mandatory training requirements. The benefits  channel stores many documents from benefits vendors that are distributed to staff.  During the time of year to shop for benefits plans, the conversations tab is very active.  The team holds weekly meetings in the benefits channel to discuss any new updates and  issues. The payroll channel is active with team members asking each other questions  about their payroll software and resolving time card discrepancies. You can see the  channel structure of this use case in Figure 5-3.  Figure 5-3.  Use Case 2: Departmental collaboration with channels   Use Case 3: Managing IT Projects A small IT consulting company has 40 staff members spread out in several different  countries and who all work from home. They have five large long-term clients for which  they provide IT solutions and support. In Microsoft Teams, they have a separate team for  each client because they do not want staff members viewing the content of a client they  are not working with.  78   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Each team has channels for project management, development, and testing. Project   managers use a tab in the project management channel to display the Planner app  in Office 365, where they assign and track tasks. They also schedule daily stand-up  meetings in Microsoft Teams, track attendance, and ask for updates in the meeting chat. The testing channels are used by the quality assurance team members. They discuss   testing activities and schedules. Also, they contain a tab to a quality log that is in a  SharePoint list. The development channels have tabs displaying Visual Studio Team  Services, which is a tool the developers use as a code repository and to track bugs. They  often hold meetings where they share their screens and do code reviews.   Pilots Microsoft Teams is a very malleable tool, which enables it to achieve many different  business needs for chat, collaboration, and meetings. There are so many different ways  that Microsoft Teams can be used, as well as settings and features that can be adjusted.  Because of this, it is recommended to roll out Teams on a small scale first. Holding  a Teams pilot minimizes risk by providing a way to work out the specifics of your  organizational culture, rather than impacting the entire organization.  The following are the benefits of doing a pilot:     Determines the areas that users struggle with so that training can be   the most beneficial     Analyzes patterns in how the pilot group uses Microsoft Teams     Receives the pilot group’s feedback and turns it into actionable ways   to improve the organization’s experience with Microsoft Teams     Excites a group of users who  hopefully  become pioneers and   cheerleaders for Microsoft Teams     Discovers any performance or security issues     Resolves any technical issues, such as firewall configuration,   application incompatibility, or authentication inconveniences that  affect user experience  79   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Choose one or a few projects, departments, or initiatives to use Microsoft Teams and  provide feedback before it goes to the masses so that you greatly increase the probability  of successful user adoption. Elect the right group of people for a pilot is important.  Generally, a good mix of skill levels and positive attitudes are the most important  characteristics for a pilot group. Using the IT department for your pilot group may not  represent how the rest of the organization will use the tool because IT professionals tend  to be more knowledgeable about Microsoft Teams and are adept in implementing new  software. You also don’t want to choose a group that is too busy to provide feedback or  use Microsoft Teams to its fullest potential.  The organization’s size, culture, and technology skills determine the level of   structure needed for the pilot. The training section of this chapter discusses the basic  topics that users need to have an understanding of. Providing some form of training to  the pilot group before they start will give them the skills to make the most out of the pilot.  At a minimum, there should be a pilot kickoff meeting that outlines the pilot’s     Goals     Expectations     Schedule     Success criteria   User Adoption Tips User adoption is an art and a science. The most important thing is to have a strategy, but  be flexible enough to make adjustments if something isn’t working. Your organization may  already have lessons learned about user adoption from previous software rollouts that can  be drawn upon when rolling out Microsoft Teams. These tips are a great starting point.   Define Your Vision The first step of having a successful Microsoft Teams implementation is deciding to use  it for the right reasons. The key target business scenario for adopting Microsoft Teams is  a group of team members working on the same job function or project that need to chat,  collaborate, and hold meetings.  80   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Additionally, before rolling out Microsoft Teams, it is a good idea to identify why you are  rolling out Microsoft Teams in the first place. Although Microsoft Teams is new and exciting  software, adding it because everyone else is, or because it is new, are not necessarily the  best reasons to deploy it. Understanding the challenges your users experience in the  workplace and how Microsoft Teams can address those challenges helps with adoption.  The following are some of the ways that Microsoft Teams can address these challenges:     Makes remote users feel more connected, as though they are working   in the same office  with other workers     Saves time by not having to open multiple applications to collaborate       Improves the findability of related artifacts by having them in one  location  Of course, each organization’s reasoning is different, but taking the time to   identify the reasons helps you create a foundation for a successful Microsoft Teams  implementation.   Communicate the Benefits Months prior to releasing Microsoft Teams in an organization, start a communications  campaign focusing on the benefits to the users. Some organizations have staff members  whose main role is to develop and carry out communication strategies. For other  organizations, it is sufficient to bring up Microsoft Teams in meetings or to post an  announcement on the intranet.   Identify the Right Team Owners It is crucial to have team owners that are advocates of Microsoft Teams. If there is anyone  that was ever an owner or took a special interest in another collaboration tool, such as  SharePoint, they may be a good candidate. Team owners interface with team members,  and it is important that the owners have a positive attitude and thorough understanding  of how Microsoft Teams works. Team owners should feel empowered to make decisions  and try new ways to use Microsoft Teams to maximize the benefits. Forcing someone  who is too busy to be a team owner, or who is uninterested in being a team owner, is  detrimental to user adoption.  81   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs   Ways Team Owners Can Engage Team Members  The best way for team owners to engage their team members is to set a shining example  of how Microsoft Teams should be used. When team owners notice a long group email  conversation, they should respond, “Let’s take this conversation to Microsoft Teams.”  Often, team members suggest holding a meeting to discuss something that could be  handled in conversations in Microsoft Teams. Team owners can start a conversation in  Microsoft Teams and let team members know that time could be saved if the subject is  discussed there.  If a team member is slow to start using Microsoft Teams, the team owner can   @mention the person in conversations so that they receive notifications and are  included in the collaboration efforts. Another great way team owners can support  team members is by being available to answer questions. Team members are much  more likely to use Microsoft Teams if they have someone to reach out to when they are  confused or have questions.   Stop Duplication A really big turn off for users is when they feel they have to perform a work function  twice. This can happen when some users adopt Microsoft Teams but others haven’t. An  example is if a user uploads a document to a channel in Microsoft Teams and sends a  message to a team member asking them to review it. The team member hasn’t adopted  Microsoft Teams so never reads the message. The user then ends up having to email  them the document and ask them again to review it. This is bound to happen during the  early stages of a Microsoft Teams release, but it needs to be corrected or there will be  a lot of frustration. It may take leadership communicating that it is an expectation that  everyone uses Microsoft Teams and reads their messages.   Check in with Users It is a mistake to release Microsoft Teams to an organization and not frequently touch  base with the users to receive feedback and answer any questions. This helps users feel  supported and serves as a reminder to use it. Checking in with users is beneficial to  increasing user adoption as long as actions are taken to improve user experiences based  on feedback. All too often, users are experiencing issues and do not let anyone know  because no one asks.  82   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs   Let the Users Have Fun The GIFs, stickers, and emojis in Microsoft Teams definitely offer a certain fun factor that  most users enjoy. This can assist in fostering a positive culture where team members can  express themselves. Unless there is a legitimate reason to disable or limit the GIFs and  stickers, leave them be. If the GIFs and stickers are overused or become inappropriate,  it may be only a few users that need guidance. If it is a widespread issue, then  communicate guidance to all users and make adjustments to the settings if necessary. In  Figure 5-4, you can see the authors having fun while writing this book.  Figure 5-4.  Having fun with Microsoft Teams   Training Training is an essential part of user adoption. Microsoft Teams is very user-friendly,  but even the most tech savvy of organizations should receive some training and  guidance. Ideally, training would begin right before Microsoft Teams is rolled out in the  organization. Users should also have access to training materials. There needs to be a  clear path for users to get questions answered. One idea is a channel in the team that  contains training materials, and the conversations tab is for team members to answer  questions.  83   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  All users should have an understanding of the following concepts:     How to access Microsoft Teams     How to use teams and channels     What tabs and connectors are     How to chat and contribute to conversations     How to share and access files     How to schedule and attend meetings     How to manage notifications  Team owners have additional duties in Microsoft Teams that they need to be trained  in. Ideally, team owners will also be available to answer questions from team members.  It is important that team owners understand the differences in what a team owner can  do in Microsoft Teams compared to someone in a team member role.  Team owners should have an understanding of these concepts:     How to create, edit, and delete a team     How to add team members to a team     How to manage team settings  Microsoft Teams offers a wide array of training videos within the application.   Microsoft realized the importance of proper user training in how to use an application.  Although these videos are very helpful and a great improvement over some past software  that has been released, they may not be all the information that you need to make  accessible to your users. In Chapter 6, you learn that creating a process for users to  request a team is a much better idea than just allowing anyone to create a team at any  time. As a part of this process, you could add any custom training you feel is necessary  for your users before they are allowed to use the team.  84   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs   Ongoing Monitoring and Improvement Adoption isn’t always thought of as an ongoing process. Unfortunately, many  organizations feel they do not have the resources or do not understand the impact of not  implementing ongoing adoption. Like all software, the more it is used, the more you will  find ways to improve how you interact with it. Over time, you may find that the software  stops being used. There are almost always legitimate reasons why this occurs. It is  important that someone is responsible for addressing the issue and resolving it to ensure  long-term success with the application.  Microsoft understands the need for ongoing monitoring as part of the overall   adoption of Teams. Microsoft introduced usage reports in the Office 365 admin  center for most of its products. To access these reports, you need to have your Office 365  administrator compile them for you or give you an admin role in the Office 365 admin  center to allow you to create these reports yourself.  At the moment, there are two specific reports that can be processed for Microsoft   Teams:     Microsoft Teams usage activity     Microsoft Teams device usage  The usage activity report has Activity and Users tabs to surface information via a   graph. In addition to this, there is detailed information on when the last time a user was  active in a team, and the number of channel messages, chats, calls, and meetings each  user has performed. From this data, you extract a number of different ideas on what  might be happening in case long-term user adoption starts to fall off.  The good thing about these reports is that by listing the individual user’s activity,   you can quickly see which users might have been very active but suddenly their activity  dropped. If a problem with long-term usage arises, you know which users to ask first  about the problem. An example of this report is shown Figure 5-5.  85   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Figure 5-5.  Sample usage report for Microsoft Teams from the Office 365 admin  center  You  or your Office 365 administrator  have access to the Microsoft Teams Device  Usage report. One benefit of this report is that it helps you realize the number of users  accessing Microsoft Teams via a mobile device. Also, if a specific mobile device’s  statistics suddenly trend downward, you can investigate the issue. Earlier in the book,  we mentioned that mobile devices do not have all the same functionalities that the client  and web interfaces have. If you see a downward trend in a specific mobile operating  system  not due to it becoming extinct, such as with Palm , the mobile app may have  presented an issue for users that you are not aware of. An example of this report is shown  in Figure 5-6.  86   ChapTer 5    User adopTIon In TeaMs  Figure 5-6.  Sample usage by device report for Teams from the Office 365 admin  center   Summary Hopefully, the biggest takeaway from this chapter is that adoption and long-term  success with Microsoft Teams in your organization is not something that you should  overlook or think will take just a small amount of time. It may not be easy to implement  all of these strategies and ideas or find stakeholders to take on the responsibility to own  them, but at least you will know that if you do not perform the tasks at hand, your odds  of success will be a lot less than those who have. In the next chapter, we discuss how to  govern Microsoft Teams within your organization. User adoption and governance go  hand in hand, because if your deployment of Microsoft Teams lacks governance, then  performance and functionality suffers, which ultimately turns off your users.  87   CHAPTER 6  Governance  Governance goes hand in hand with user adoption. Having a well-thought-out  governance plan ensures that Microsoft Teams is managed and used in the way it  was intended. Users will adopt Microsoft Teams if it is well-governed and useful to  them. A solid governance plan ensures that the user experience remains positive and  that organization assets are stored and used properly. The biggest selling point of  Microsoft Teams is that it improves the speed and ease of collaboration by providing  one location where teammates can interact, share content, and conduct meetings.  However, the benefits will only be realized if time is spent planning the administration  and management of the service prior to making it available to your users. Without a  governance plan, there are pitfalls that will negate these benefits.  This chapter discusses the essential areas of governance for Microsoft Teams to  consider and offer practical advice. Real-world examples and explanations help you  build a governance plan that ensures that content is secure and that Microsoft Teams is  convenient and easy to use, thus driving user adoption.   Creating Your Own Plan Creating your own governance plan for Microsoft Teams should, at the very least,  include the following items:     How to organize the structure of your team  this could be different for   each team you create   creating Teams      How to allow people to request or create a new team  a process for      How to determine if there should be a new team created    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_6  89   Chapter 6    GovernanCe     Understanding options to archive old or unused teams     Features and organizational settings  Now let’s go into more detail for each bullet point so that you can create your own   governance plan.   Organizational Structure for Teams and Channels Microsoft Teams can easily become unmanageable if it is rolled out with the default  settings, and users have no guidance. By default, all users can create new teams and  channels. One parallel that many IT professionals can draw upon is the structure of  SharePoint. Before the importance of governance was realized, many users were given  access to create new sites at their discretion. Without proper training, planning, and  strategizing about when to create new sites, there quickly became an uncontrollable  environment. The lack of governance harmed user adoption of SharePoint; let’s use the  lessons learned to avoid this happening with Microsoft Teams.  It is very important to analyze your organization’s work functions, departments,   products, initiatives, and or projects to strategize how to lay out teams and channels.  A key point to remember is that permissions can only be set at the team level. Until  Microsoft releases secure channels, all content in channels is open and available to all  members of the team that the channel is part of.  Tip  When strategizing the organizational structure of teams and channels, it is  very important to consider who should have access to what content.  Figure 6-1 shows an example of an organizational structure where a team is created   for each major department, and including each office that falls under the department  with a channel.  90   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-1.  Teams organization by department  As you can see, the Information Technology department has a team with channels  for the Help Desk, Software Development, Quality Assurance, and Security offices. The  General channel is used for department-wide communication and file sharing. Each  office uses their channel for communication and collaboration. This organizational  structure makes sense in theory, but if the Security office is communicating about  confidential topics in their conversations tab, all the other offices will be able to read it.  In a situation like this, each office needs its own team.  Note  Being able to restrict permissions at the channel level is a highly  anticipated piece of functionality for teams. Microsoft is looking into adding it, but  no date is set at this time.  91   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Now imagine if all of the offices were already heavily using their channel in the   Information Technology team by having conversations, holding meetings, and uploading  files. After four months, it is realized that the team needs to be broken up so that each  office can have its own team. But, all the conversations and meeting information from  the offices’ channels cannot be moved to their teams.   Note  Conversations and meeting content cannot be moved from one team to  another or from one channel to another.  The only option for the offices to see their content in the Information Technology   team is to leave the team active. This can lead to confusion and error because the offices  may accidently use their old channel instead of their new team.  If you have to leave a team that is no longer used, but team members still   Tip  need to access the existing content, rename the team and add a description  to indicate that there should be nothing new added. For example, “Information  technology team—reaD onLY.” In the description, let users know which  team they should be using instead. You can also consider using the archiving  functionality found under the “gear” icon in the bottom left corner of your teams  interface, then select the team you would like to archive.  Figure 6-2 shows an organization that has organized teams by project. It is common  for organizations to create a team for every project, client, or case that they work on. This  is different than organizing by department because there is usually a definitive start and  end in these scenarios. Having this structure makes sense for when there are different  people working on every project, client, or case, especially if they need to invite external  guest users to collaborate with. If a law firm is using Microsoft Teams to collaborate on  files and hold conversations about a case, they may want to invite the client to view files  in Teams and discuss the case. It is important that they only have access to their own  case, not that of others. A separate team per case is the only way to achieve this.  92   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-2.  Teams organization by project  There is no one blueprint for the Microsoft Teams organizational structure that can be   used for all organizations. Not properly planning how teams and channels will be organized  can severely damage user adoption. It can also put an organization at risk of having  sensitive or private content accessed by the wrong people. An analysis of the different work  functions of an organization and gaining insight into who is sharing and collaborating on  different types of content will help you plan for success. As discussed in Chapter 5, holding a  pilot prior to the rollout to the entire organization empowers you in this analysis.   Process for Creating and Managing Teams Planning the team’s organizational structure is the first step. No matter how well you  plan, governing the team’s organizational structure is an ongoing duty. The next step is  to decide how new teams are created and the process to manage it.   Restricting Who Can Create Teams By default, everyone can create a team. This has both pros and cons. Allowing everyone  to be able to create a team allows for fluidity of work and an agile approach for  organizations. Small organizations that are technologically savvy may be able to get  away with leaving the default team creation setting by providing guidance on when it is  appropriate to create a new team.  93   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  For medium and large-sized organizations, the default team creation setting can be   problematic. With too many cooks in the kitchen, it is inevitable that a team is created  in error or for inappropriate reasons. If it becomes confusing for users as to which team  or channel to use for different content, user adoption will suffer. To help determine if a  formal team creation process should be implemented at your organization, we list the  pros and cons of each in Table 6-1.  Table 6-1.  Advantages and Disadvantages of Having a Formal Teams Request  Process in an Organization  Without a team creation governance process With a team creation governance process  promotes adoption and usage  Could limit user adoption  allows users to make a team what they want   it to be  Might restrict the ways users can interact and  utilize teams  Creates massive sprawl with difficulties  managing and taking up storage space  prevents “teams sprawl,” which save sharepoint  and other services storage space  Doesn’t follow naming conventions  allows for understandable naming conventions  possible issues with classification and the   types of data being stored in the team  allows for classification and tracking information  about the team  allows for “inappropriate language” in a name  hard to monitor decommissioning and retention  prevents users from creating teams named  “inappropriately”  allows monitoring to know when to  decommission or how long to retain a team  prevents users from agreeing to a terms of  service or required training  Can affect other office 365 applications that rely  on groups  planner   hard to determine what teams you have in your  environment  may change   allows It administrators to manage and monitor  teams in the organization  Doesn’t guarantee an administrator is an owner  of a team  allows you to place an administration group as a  team owner  allows for duplicate team names, which can  create confusion for everyone  prevents duplicate naming  94   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Note  team members can only be restricted to create channels at the team level.  there is no setting in the office 365 admin center to restrict channel permissions.  As you can see in Table 6-1, most reasoning leans toward implementing a team   creation and governance process at an organization. To restrict team creation, an Office  365 administrator needs to run PowerShell commands. One issue with this is that to  restrict someone from creating a new team, you have to restrict them from creating a  new group in Office 365. This is because when you create a new team, it creates a group.  Restricting someone from creating a group also prevents them from creating a team.  Obviously, if there is a strong business need for everyone to be able to create groups or  Planners in Office 365, you will not be able to restrict them from creating teams.  In order to restrict someone from creating teams, you need to restrict them   Note  from creating groups in office 365.   Process for Creating Teams If the decision is made to restrict who can create a team, you need to determine a  process for how teams are created. There are several options for how this can be  handled. What is best can be vastly different from one organization to another.  If the creation of new teams is restricted to a small group of collaboration specialists  or IT professionals, users will need a quick and easy process to request new teams. If the  process is not clear, or is cumbersome or takes too long, users will find work-arounds  to get their jobs done. They could begin using an existing team inappropriately to  collaborate on content unrelated to the rest of the Teams’ content or they could begin  collaborating in a different tool outside of Teams. Once a group of people gets in a work  rhythm, it is difficult to change their habits and bring them back to using Teams.  If an organization already has a well-established ticketing system, this may be the   best option. It is imperative that end users clearly know how to specifically request  a new team. Teams-related requests and questions need to be quickly routed to the  collaboration specialists or IT professionals that specialize in Teams. Open lines of  communication between those that create the teams and the end users requesting them  are necessary.  95   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  If an organization does not have an existing ticketing or help desk system, some   mechanism for users to request a team is needs to be developed. One suggestion is to  use a SharePoint list that everyone in the organization has access to. Figure 6-3 shows  an example of a SharePoint list form to request a new team. There should be fields for  users to enter the name of the team that they are requesting. It is also important that  they provide a reason for needing the team. This helps determine if the team is actually  necessary. Team owners of the new team should be included in the request. Also, it is  important to find out if external guest users will be part of the proposed team.  Figure 6-3.  Example SharePoint form allowing users to request a new team  96   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Because there are so many different ways that an organization could implement a   Teams creation process, in the next section, we explain many of the concepts you could  use as a process. There is no magic answer on which process to select. Evaluating the  pros and cons of each and matching them to your organization’s needs will help you  decide which option to pursue.   Teams Creation Options In this section, we present the options and their pros and cons.   No Team Creation Process  Just “flipping the switch” to turn on Microsoft Teams without any planning or  consideration is not an option for most organizations. Unless you have no concerns  about the data, we do not advise taking this approach. Noting this, the following states  the pros and cons.  This approach promotes the greatest short-term adoption possibilities, requires little  planning or training, and is the fastest to implement.  The negative consequences of this process are great if you have any need to retain,  organize, sort, manage, or reuse your data over a period of time. Later in this chapter, we  explain many of the negative effects the process could have.   Team Request Reviewed by Admin or Help Desk  One scenario of a team creation process is implementing a team request process in  which a SharePoint list is created for users to submit. An admin, help desk, or IT teams  specialist reviews the requests and then creates the team if it is approved.  The pros of this solution are that it is quick to implement, and there is no additional  cost for the organization. Configuration of the SharePoint list could prevent users from  submitting a duplicate team name.  97  Pros  Cons  Pros   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Cons  This process requires a human to process each request, which takes time and resources.  It also requires you to turn off the ability to create groups for your users and only allow  certain persons to create new groups and teams.   Placing Teams Requestors in a Security Group  This approach is another recommended by Microsoft. It could be considered a “meet us  in the middle” idea. To implement it, you need your Office 365 administrator to create  a security group and only place persons you trust and request in this group. You could  ensure that the users have completed training before placing them in this group.  The pros of this approach are that it frees up time for your IT administrators or help desk  by letting trusted users create teams themselves. It also allows those persons to create  other related Office 365 applications such as Planners, Yammer groups, and Office 365  groups without further interaction from others.  This process doesn’t guarantee that the people you place in the security group will  follow all of your rules. If you have naming conventions, or you want to prevent  duplicate names, or you want to restrict the number of teams created due to space and  organizational requirements, the users may not abide by the rules.   SharePoint Request List that Triggers a Flow  If you looking for an idea that completely restricts users from creating teams  and  any other groups-related applications , this concept is the least programmatic way  to accomplish the task. It requires setting up a SharePoint list, which you program to  perform any checks that you need before the user submits the list item. Upon the list  item being submitted, you trigger a flow that uses the REST API to create a team and then  notify your users that the team has been created.  Pros  Cons  98   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Pros  Cons  Pros  Cons  The advantages of this approach are controlling the number, naming, and frequency of  new teams. It also requires a bit less programming than the upcoming final suggestion. It is  almost immediate and doesn’t require your users to wait for the new team to be created.  The disadvantages of this approach are that it takes time to create and requires someone  who has some technical knowledge. It also requires that your organization has approved  the flow to use, and it could end up with additional costs if you have run a very large  number of requests. Finally, if you have any needs to customize, the components that  create a team  i.e., making alterations to the SharePoint site collection to disable external  sharing , you will not be able to do so. The restriction that users have to request any  application that is group-based also applies.   SharePoint Request List with PowerShell or Code  This idea is the most intricate of any we have discussed. However, if you are in a very  rigid organization that demands structure, governance, and control, this approach will  suit you the best. The idea starts with a user requesting a team from a SharePoint list,  and then either a scheduled task on a Windows server or Azure Functions processes the  list items, creates the team, and notifies the requestor.  The advantage of this method is that it controls your team down to the greatest detail.  You could customize your team  within the parameters that Microsoft allows  to appear  in a certain way, or to have certain users in it. You could also alter attached components,  such as SharePoint site collection sharing settings. If you need to track other information  about the team, or to create an annual review process, it can also be done.  The downside of this approach is that it requires a skilled programmer to create. You also  need either an Azure account or a Windows server to run the code on. If you choose to set  the code on a schedule, your users will experience a delay before they can use the team.  The restriction that users must request any application that is group-based also applies.  99   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  If all of these ideas seem too time-consuming and difficult, you can search the   Internet for a third-party application that automates it. These products usually cost a  great deal and need to be thoroughly investigated before purchasing.   Determining If a New Team Should Be Created When reviewing a request for a new team, there are a few factors that you should  consider in determining whether the team should be created. Primarily, you want to  make sure that you avoid duplication by creating a team that already exists. You also  want to avoid creating too many teams. Duplication makes it confusing and frustrating  for end users. Having a large number of teams creates a hassle for users that are receiving  too many notifications and having to switch between teams all day to get work done.  If external guest users need to be included on a team, a new team will be needed. The  reason is that, typically, external guests are not able to access any team content outside  of the work they are performing. Even if the proposed new team could be a channel  under an existing team, if external guests shouldn’t be able to access the rest of the team  channels, a new team has to be created.  When deciding if a new Team should be created, as yourself the following questions:     Does a team or channel already exist for the same department,   initiative, project, case, or account?     Does a team already exist that has the same members as the   proposed team?     Are external guest team members going to be included?   Roles and Responsibilities As with any process or system, assigning roles and responsibilities is essential. With  Teams, there are primary roles that need to be assigned and communicated to make sure  that there is accountability. These roles are decision maker, Office 365 administrator,  team owner, and team member.  100   Chapter 6    GovernanCe   Decision Maker There are decisions regarding Teams that need to be made on an ongoing basis.  This includes decisions about implementation, configuration, integration with other  applications, and processes for creating teams and channels. If an organization decides  to limit who can create teams, the decision maker may be in charge of determining  whether a team should be created or not. Many large organizations have created  governance boards to provide technical leadership and make decisions regarding  the use of collaboration tools and their maintenance. We have witnessed SharePoint  governance boards kill collaboration and user adoption due to taking too long to make  decisions and for micromanaging SharePoint to the point that it was unusable.  When leadership and IT staff, who are usually part of these boards, are too busy   or are uninterested in being involved, it slows down collaboration and thus hurts  user adoption. In some cases, an official governance board is necessary due to an  organizational policy, or the governance board model is successful for decision making  on other collaboration tools.  Another option for decision making is to designate specialists to facilitate and  expedite collaboration and serve as the liaison between end users, team owners,  and Office 365 administrators. These collaboration specialists should have thorough  knowledge of Teams, as well as any other collaboration tools that the organization uses.  A collaboration specialist ensures that questions and requests are handled promptly.   Office 365 Administrator Office 365 administrators have access to the Microsoft Teams tenant-wide settings. It  is their job to provide technical administration guidance and support. They are also  responsible for any performance-related issues experienced when using Microsoft  Teams.   Team Owner Team owners have the important responsibility of leading a team. Team owners monitor  the content and make sure that it is appropriate and productive. Team owners also have  several settings that they can change for the team, and directly impact the experience  team members have when working in the team. Teams allows for up to ten team owners  per team. In most cases, we recommend having at least two team owners, but not more   101   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  than four. Having any more than this will most likely lead to confusion and aggravation.  Team owners should always stay in close communication with one another so that  everyone is on the same page, especially when changing settings, which are discussed  later in this chapter. Team members always need to know who the team owners are so  that they know where to go for a first line of support and questions.   Team Member Team members can be part of one or many teams. Anyone in an organization assigned a  Teams license can be a team member. Team members are responsible for staying current  on their work. They have the responsibility to discuss and work on the appropriate  content for the team and channel. They also need to understand how to follow and  favorite teams and channels so that their notifications are effective.   Feature Review Remarkably, much of the functionality in Microsoft Teams can be changed and  customized. Some of the feature customization is done at the team level and some at the  organizational level. Team owners have the ability to customize their team’s features and  member permissions in the team settings. The vast power team owners have to shape  the user experience is just one more reason that it is critical to choose the right team  owners and train them.  Office 365 administrators can use tenant-wide settings to change and customize   the features for all teams. Some settings can be set at both the team level and the  organizational level. It is important to know that the tenant-wide settings always take  priority over the team settings.  Note  You can customize teams features at both the organizational level and the  team level, but the organizational settings always take precedence.  102   Chapter 6    GovernanCe   Organizational Settings An organization’s Teams experience and features can be customized using the Office  365 admin center tenant-wide settings. Every organization has unique business needs  and scenarios. Teams is built in a way that much of the functionality can be enabled or  disabled in an a la carte fashion. Holding a pilot helps establish which features should  be enabled or disabled in an organization. Once Teams is rolled out to everyone in the  organization, everyone becomes accustomed to the functionalities. End users will be  unhappy if features get removed after they have already started using them. For this  reason, it is important for Teams administrators to perform a review of the feature  settings in the Office 365 admin center.  To review Teams tenant-wide settings in the admin center    1.  Click Settings, and then click Services & add-ins, as shown in   Figure 6-4.    2.  Select Microsoft Teams from the list.  Figure 6-4.  Microsoft Teams service settings. Depending on when you are reading  this, this option may have been moved to the Skype for Business and Microsoft  Teams admin center in Office 365.  103   Chapter 6    GovernanCe   Email Integration  Since by default every channel is given an email address that anyone can send emails to,  Microsoft provides a way to disable or limit them. Office 365 administrators can restrict  everyone from being able to email all channels. They can also set it so that only people  from certain email domains can send channel emails.  We suggest only disabling email to every channel if there is a legitimate need. When   emails are sent to the channel email address, they show as messages in the conversations  tab, and team members can respond there. This reduces the number of group emails.  You may want to limit who can email the channel if you start getting spammed, or emails  become distracting or irrelevant to the work  see Figure 6-5 .  Figure 6-5.  Email integration settings in the Office 365 admin center   External Apps and Cloud Storage  Microsoft Teams has the capability to connect with other apps. When creating tabs in  channels, these apps can be selected so that users can work with them without having  to leave the Microsoft Teams app. Office 365 admins can disable the use of any external  apps, as seen in Figure 6-6. They can also pick and choose which apps should be  allowed. You can also enable side-loading apps.  104   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-6.  Apps settings in the Office 365 admin center   Cloud Storage  Cloud storage options outside of Office 365, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, can be  configured to allow uploading and sharing files. Office 365 administrators can choose  to disable all cloud storage options or to only keep some enabled. We see an example of  these settings in Figure 6-7.  Figure 6-7.  Cloud storage options in the Teams settings in the Office 365 admin  center  105   Chapter 6    GovernanCe   Messaging  There are many messaging options that the Office 365 administrator can change. Private  chat can be completely disabled. The messaging experience can be customized by  changing options for memes, stickers, and GIFs. The content rating can be changed if  posting explicit content is a concern. The important messaging settings are the ones that  impact message editing and deletion. By default, users can edit and delete all of their  own messages. There is a setting  that is not enabled by default  that allows team owners  to delete all messages, as seen in Figure 6-8. There may be a need to turn this on if there  are a lot of “fluff” messages in a team. This setting should be enabled with caution, and  team owners should receive training and guidance on this.  Figure 6-8.  Messaging settings in the Teams in the Office 365 admin center   Calls and Meetings  Private, channel, and ad hoc meetings can all be disabled. If an organization already  has a method for holding virtual meetings that users have adopted, and it is working  well, it may be a good idea to disable meetings in Teams in order to avoid confusion. An  organization may have issues with allowing video and screen sharing in meetings if there  are any bandwidth or security policies prohibiting it. These options can be disabled, as  seen in Figure 6-9. Private calling is another option that can be disabled if necessary.  106   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-9.  Calls and meeting settings in the Office 365 admin center   External Users  Teams allows external users to collaborate with team members. There is a common  business need to invite clients, subcontractors, vendors, and consultants to view team  files and hold conversations within Teams. Many agencies have privacy concerns about  allowing external users within Teams. To keep external users out of Teams, Office 365  administrators can select Guest as the license type, and then turn off Teams as the users  of that type  see Figure 6-10 .  Figure 6-10.  Preventing external users from accessing a team in the Office 365  admin center   Team-Level Settings Team owners can customize how their team is used by changing the team settings. Team  member and guest permissions can be changed, as well as the ability to mention teams  and channels, and the “fun” settings, which include emojis, memes, and GIFs. These  settings do not impact any other teams.  107   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  It is important that team members know to only change these settings if there is a   need. Team owners should communicate any setting changes to end users so that they  are not surprised when they are unable to do something.  To review team settings    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team name.    2.  Click Manage team.    3.  Click Settings, as seen in Figure 6-11.  Figure 6-11.  Team settings   Member Permissions  Team owners have a set of permissions that they can remove for team members.  Permissions are set for all team members. There is no way to grant some team members  different permissions than other team members, except for guest members. For large  or not technologically savvy teams, we recommend removing the ability to create,  update, delete, and restore channels, apps, tabs, and connectors. These actions should  be performed at the team owner’s discretion. Some organizations may way to remove  the permissions of team members to delete and or edit their messages. Be very cautious  about changing these settings because team members will be much less likely to use the  conversation functionality in Teams if the know they can’t edit typos or delete messages  written in error or that they change their mind about. Figure 6-12 illustrates these settings.  108   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-12.  Member permissions settings   Guest Permissions  There is the ability to grant guest team members permissions for creating, updating, and  deleting channels. By default, this is disabled  see Figure 6-13 , because there are few  situations where guests need or should have this control.  Figure 6-13.  Guest permission settings   Email Integration  Email settings are configurable on a per channel basis, as seen in Figure 6-14. It is  possible to restrict only team members or email addresses from within certain domains  so as to be able to email the channel address. Changing the email settings for only a  few channels confuses end users, so these settings should only be touched if there is a  specific business reason.  109   Chapter 6    GovernanCe  Figure 6-15.  @mentions  110  Figure 6-14.  Channel email settings   Team and Channel Mentions  Both teams and channels can be mentioned in conversations, as seen in Figure 6-15.  The main point of mentions is that they kick off notifications. A mention of a team sends  notifications to everyone on the team. A mention of a channel sends notifications to  everyone that follows the channel.  A common complaint about Teams is that there are too many notifications, and   so people stop paying attention to them. A team owner may want to disable team and  channel mentions if team members are overwhelmed with notifications.   Chapter 6    GovernanCe   Memes, GIFs, and Stickers Settings  Memes, GIFs, and stickers can be disabled by the team owner. Team owners can also set  a content filter to remove anything inappropriate. One scenario where team owners may  want to disable the “fun stuff”  see Figure 6-16 , is if there are guest members that are  clients or customers. Also, if the team is overusing memes, GIFs, and stickers, and don’t  respond to guidance to minimize their use from the team owner, they may have to resort  to completely disabling them.  Figure 6-16.  Fun stuff   Summary In this chapter, we reviewed some of the best practices and questions you should  ask when a new team is requested. As you can see, there is quite a bit to take into  consideration for a proper Microsoft Teams rollout. One bright note, though, is that once  you have taken the time to set this up, each corresponding team should flow easily and  have a greater chance for adoption.  In the following chapter, we discuss how your organization can gain even more value   from Teams by automating business processes using Microsoft Flow and bots.  111   CHAPTER 7  Automating Business  Processes in Teams  In the modern workplace, the automation of business processes and information  gathering is becoming more and more commonplace. If a task at work is routine,  simple, and repetitive, and involves data entry or searching for information, it is likely  a good candidate for business process automation. With Microsoft Teams being a  digital workspace that is meant to serve as a catalyst for communication, collaboration,  decision making, and creativity, it makes sense to automate as many tasks as possible so  that the focus is on bringing the team to the next level of success. Microsoft Teams allows  data from third-party cloud-based applications to be leveraged, so the possibilities for  business process automation are vast. Business process automation can be achieved in  Microsoft Teams using bots and Microsoft Flow.   What Are Bots? Since Microsoft Teams is a chat-based application, it isn’t surprising that you are able  to automate some business processes by chatting with a bot. A bot is a program that  is configured to send predefined messages and decision prompts to end users, which  help them to streamline and automate processes. Microsoft Teams offers a platform for  team members to interact with intelligent bots in both natural conversations in chat and  through specific commands, depending on the bot installed. Bots in Microsoft Teams  connect with cloud services. For the most part, bots are built to quickly run simple and  repetitive tasks that would take a person much longer to complete. Bots in Microsoft  Teams connect with cloud services. They are built by developers using the Microsoft Bot  Framework, which allows them to easily connect with Microsoft Teams and the App Store.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J. Bailey, Mastering Microsoft Teams, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3670-3_7  113   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  In Microsoft Teams, bots are initiated in chat messages or in conversation messages   in channels; but depending on the bot installed, it may only work in one or the other.  When you send a bot a message, it usually sends instructions on what functionality it has  to offer. Figure 7-1 shows examples of the bots available in Teams. Some of the apps have  other components, such as a tool that can be used in a tab.  Figure 7-1.  Examples of apps with bots available in Teams  Note  The list of bots available in Microsoft Teams is constantly changing as new  bots are developed.  114   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs   What Bots Can Do Microsoft Teams comes with a bot called the T-Bot, which you can chat with to get  information. When Teams is opened for the first time, T-Bot sends a message with  instructions on how to interact with it. Figure 7-2 shows the T-Bot, which is a great  example of how Microsoft Teams’ bots work and what they are capable of.  Figure 7-2.  How to use the T-Bot  Bots in Microsoft Teams connect users with cloud services, and then leverage that  cloud service’s functionality to perform basic jobs in Teams when you chat with them  and give them commands. Bots help Microsoft Teams users with job duties such as  scheduling meetings or events, taking polls to gather information from team members,  and managing team tasks. In some cases, you may find one bot that does everything you  need to automate your business process. Otherwise, it may be necessary to install and   115   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  combine the functionality of two or more bots. Although apps in the Microsoft Teams  store are organized into the categories of Analytics and BI, Developer and IT, Education,  Human Resources, Productivity, Project Management, Sales and Support, and Social  and Fun, the three main functions that bots are performing are scheduling, task  management, and polling. Figure 7-3 shows how apps are organized in the Microsoft  Teams App Store.  Figure 7-3.  Organization of apps in the Microsoft Teams App Store  116   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs   Scheduling  Scheduling meetings can be a time-consuming task that bots in Teams can assist with.  Some examples of how bots can organize meetings are by syncing calendars of team  members and showing available times to pick from, polling attendees to vote on the  best meeting time, scheduling a meeting and sending out meeting invites, and even  providing a list of meeting rooms to book based on which are available.  Although we know meetings can be held in Teams, some organizations that use   other products for meetings can disable this feature. Many common meetings services  have bots in Teams, so when using the bot, team members are able to create meetings  within these services.   Task Management  Bots in Microsoft Teams can assist project managers with tasks such as collecting  daily status reports from team members. Reminders to complete status reports can  be automatically sent by a bot, and then team members can respond with their status,  which is added to a report that can be viewed by the project manager. Reminders to team  members can be configured based on when they are due.  There are also bots that can track and manage documents and tasks through their   life cycles. Task-based time tracking is also possible within Microsoft Teams using a bot.  Project management business processes that involve collecting information, tracking,  and reminders can be automated with bots.   Polling  There are bots in Microsoft Teams that have polling capabilities. Polling is a simple way  to get feedback from team members by providing them a predefined list of choices that  they can select from. Team members can be automatically notified in Microsoft Teams  when there is a new poll. The bot consolidates the responses, allowing for the results to  be analyzed. Although this functionality may seem trivial, it can be extremely powerful  and a huge time-saver when trying to seek the opinions of team members when making  a decision.  117   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs   How to Add Bots  Bots can be added to a team by every team member unless the setting is changed by  either the Office 365 administrator or the team owner, as shown in Figure 7-4.  Note  external apps can be disabled by the office 365 administrator. if you cannot  add a bot, this could be the issue.    1.  Click the ellipse  …  to the right of the team that you want to add   To add a bot to a team  the bot to.    2.  Click Manage team.    3.  Click Apps.    4.  Click the Go to Store button.    5.  Click bots on the left underneath Store to show only the bot apps.    6.  Select the bot to add to the team.    7.  Select the team name from the Add to team drop-down menu,   and then click Install.  118   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  Figure 7-4.  Installing a bot   Using Microsoft Flow with Teams Microsoft Flow is a cloud-based application that is part of Office 365 and can be used for  free as part of the same subscription with Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Flow is a business  process automation tool that can collect data, automate approvals, copy files, send  notifications, and more. Microsoft Flow can connect data from Microsoft Teams with  data from other Office 365 applications, as well as third-party cloud-based applications.  119   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  For a flow to run, it needs to be triggered. There are many triggers that stem from   hundreds of applications, but some examples are when an item in SharePoint is created  or modified, when a new Microsoft Forms response is submitted, or when an Office  365 Outlook event is added, updated, or deleted. There are no Microsoft Teams triggers  at this time, but Microsoft Flow functionality evolves often. Once a flow is triggered,  conditions can be added that allow for different things to happen based on if they are  true or not. Actions are tasks that the flow performs. Actions are what the flow does to  complete the business process.   Teams Actions in Microsoft Flow There are four actions that Microsoft Flow performs in Microsoft Teams, as shown in  Figure 7-5. These actions provide an automatic way to create a channel, list the channels,  list teams, and post messages.  Figure 7-5.  Teams actions available in Microsoft Flow   Create a Channel  The create a channel action in Microsoft Teams  see Figure 7-6  is extremely useful. This  action automatically creates a channel based on a trigger. An attribute from a previous  step can be used as the channel name; for example, you can create a flow that is triggered  when an item is added to a SharePoint list. It then performs the action of creating a  channel using the Title field from the SharePoint item as the channel name. A step  can be added to the flow to only allow the creation a channel if someone in authority  approves, such as the team owner or an IT professional.  120   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  Figure 7-6.  Creating a channel action in Microsoft Flow   List Channels  The list channels action  see Figure 7-7  automatically provides a list of the channels  in a team. It monitors channel creation; for example, an IT department could receive  a weekly list of all channels to make sure that there aren’t channels being created  inappropriately. A condition can be added to the flow to only list channels that were  created within a certain amount of days.  Figure 7-7.  List channels actions in Microsoft Flow   List Teams  The list teams action  see Figure 7-8  is similar to the list channels action, except  the teams are listed, not the channels. This is a great way to automate the process of  monitoring the teams created in an Office 365 tenant. The team name, team ID, and  team description attributes can be listed in an email or a report. Only the teams that the  user running the flow is part of are listed.  Figure 7-8.  List teams action in Microsoft Flow  121   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs   Post a Message  The post a message action  see Figure 7-9  is likely the most commonly used Microsoft  Teams action in Microsoft Flow. It notifies a team when something of interest has  happened outside of Microsoft Teams. Common scenarios are to post a message to  a team channel when a task in SharePoint is marked complete, when a new form is  submitted, or when a bug is opened in Visual Studio Team Services.  Figure 7-9.  Post message action in Microsoft Flow   Templates Microsoft Flow offers several prebuilt templates. There is very little configuration  involved when using templates, and they are the easiest way to get started with using  Microsoft Flow. As shown in Figure 7-10, you can search for teams, and then get a listing  of all the templates that connect with Microsoft Teams. You need to have an account with  any other service that the flow connects to, and you have to provide credentials for it to  work. Microsoft Flow templates can act as a starting point, and then steps and conditions  can be added.  122   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  Figure 7-10.  Teams templates in Microsoft Flow   Microsoft Flow App in Teams The Microsoft Flow app, which can be installed in Microsoft Teams, provides a chat bot.  This personal app helps users keep track of their flows. Flows can be created and edited  within Teams. Since the Microsoft Flow app is a personal app, it is not seen by other team  members. Each user installs the Microsoft Flow app themselves and can display their  flows and approvals.  With the Microsoft Flow bot in Teams  see Figure 7-11 , flows are run by command.   When you chat with the Microsoft Flow bot, it lists the available flows to run. You can  then command it to run a flow by typing Run flow followed by the number listed for  the particular flow. At this time, only flows that run on a schedule are initiated by the  Microsoft Flow bot. If you create a scheduled flow that lists all channels in a team and  sends them in a monthly report, you can use the Microsoft Flow bot to send the report  on demand as needed in Teams. Another scenario is if you have a scheduled flow that  regularly posts articles, website links, or messages to social media sites such as LinkedIn  or Twitter, you can use the Microsoft Flow bot to post on demand.  123   ChapTer 7    auToMaTing Business proCesses in TeaMs  Figure 7-11.  Microsoft Flow bot in Teams   Summary In this chapter, we reviewed the ways you can automate your business processes in  Microsoft Teams using bots and Microsoft Flow. There are many benefits and time-  saving opportunities with automating business processes in Microsoft Teams, but this  is a more advanced aspect of the product that isn’t always necessary. Focusing on users  adopting the basic Microsoft Teams functionality is much more important. Be advised  that although bots and flows are fairly new and exciting, they should not be set up if there  is no business need. However, if you or a team member are spending a lot of time on an  arduous task that is simple and repetitive, it is definitely worth exploring the business  process automation options available within Microsoft Teams.  124   CHAPTER 8  Known Challenges  and the Future  Some parts of Microsoft Teams are new and built with open source technologies, which  is a different direction for Microsoft. Due to this  and other reasons , you will possibly  find issues with the application when you use it. You will also most likely encounter  some limitations in trying to accomplish your tasks as you work with it daily. Although  this might sound a bit discouraging, Microsoft is investing in Microsoft Teams a great  deal—more so than some of its other software. Depending on when you are reading  this book  compared to when it was written , knowing the roadmap, issues, and user  feedback can help make a realistic plan in how to use Microsoft Teams. In this chapter,  we discuss issues that may occur when using Microsoft Teams.  Microsoft Teams replaces Skype for Business Online in Office 365  it is not replacing   Skype for Business On-Premises at the time of writing this book . Microsoft Teams  has most of the Skype for Business Online functionality, but is missing some features.  Additionally, Microsoft Teams is adding new video and calling features to the application  beyond what Skype for Business provided.  Microsoft Teams is a new generation of collaboration software, in which the ability to  work with others on files and conversations is provided. When you put these all together,  you see that there are a myriad of different features coming to Microsoft Teams, but there  are also some things that aren’t quite working well at the onset.  Remember, Microsoft Teams is changing at a rapid pace, and depending on when   you are reading this book, some of the issues discussed in this chapter may have been fixed  or have had work-arounds.    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J. Bailey 2018  M. Hubbard and M. J.

Editing Office Documents Let’s say that you are writing a book and that you are consistently typing long paragraphs  and pasting images into a Word document. The flow of how you work depends on how  you created the Word document. As you can see in Figure 8-1, there are different ways to  get a document in Teams.  Figure 8-1.  The many ways to create or upload a document in Teams  Microsoft has made a good deal of effort to create a seamless experience for users,  so that working with Office files appears to be similar, regardless of how you access or  create them. However, there are some features differ among methods. An example of  this is when you create a Microsoft Teams Word document in a browser. This is really  just embedding a Word Online authoring experience inside Microsoft Teams. Some   126   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  people may not realize this. With Word Online, there is no ability to change the autosave  timing. Word Online saves data as you type it. However, with the installed version of  Word, you have the full set of Word configuration options.  The challenge is that creating a unified interface has good points and not-so-good   points. If you are creating Word documents that are not very large, the online Word  experience typically works well. For large documents, however, it is better to use the  Word client by either opening the document in Word from Microsoft Teams or by  creating a new file in Word and later uploading it to the files tab.   Importing and Exporting Channels, Data, and Files A limitation of Microsoft Teams is its ability to move data, such as conversations between  channels and or other Teams. Additionally, moving groups of files to another team  does not exist. If you plan properly, you can avoid a lot of issues involving the need to  move the data around. However, as we explain in an upcoming section, the inability to  secure channels differently from the team itself will cause people to organize them in  different ways. This means that if you need to change how the team is organized and  who sees what, you will not be able to move data and conversations to a new place.  Because Microsoft does not make public all the plans for its software, it is unknown if the  company is working on a tool to move these items.   Private Channels and Tabs There is no option to secure items within a team to specific people, if you are in a team  then you see everything in it  for the business version of the software, there is a separate  version of Teams for educational institutions . This “all or nothing” concept can present  challenges. As an example, let’s say that you are creating a team to hire a candidate for  an open position at your organization. You might place all the candidates’ résumés  on the team. You then invite everyone in Human Resources and the other hiring areas  to the team. Each candidate could be interviewed and notes could be kept about the  candidates to help determine which person is the final choice for the job.  The challenges start to appear when you need to restrict an area regarding the salary   and the job offer to only people in Human Resources. There is no way to secure the  offer details if it is in a channel or a tab. Also consider that in channels, the back end of  Teams uses many different applications. The ability to secure all the content in these  applications would take considerable implementation.  127   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  The good news is that we believe Microsoft is currently working on functionality to  allow users to create private channels. We will have to wait and see if options for secure  channels come and how they will operate.   Read-Only Permissions There are at least two reasons for having a read-only team and one of them has been  delivered just as this book was going to press. The first is for archival purposes. This  archive option is now available in the “gear” icon at the bottom left of your Microsoft  Teams interface.  The second reason, which is still unavailable when this book was being published,  is to create an information-only team where users can only read information and only  managers can post information. Although, you can change member permissions in team  settings to only allow owners to post messages, this isn’t exactly the same as a read-only  team that is still in an active status.   Duplicate Team Names One issue that could be confusing to your users is that Teams allows you to create  teams with the same name, as seen in Figure 8-2. On the back end, the team is really a  unique number called a GUID  globally unique identifier . The system uses this GUID  to manage the team behind the scenes, so the duplicate name issue is not relevant to the  system. The display name is what users see. As shown in Figure 8-2, multiple teams with  the same name can confuse users who do not know which team is which.  Have an IT administrator or programmer create a script to prevent duplicate names,   or purchase Azure Premium to take advantage of the groups naming policy feature to  work around this issue.  128   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-2.  Teams with the same display name can be created   Deleting a Team Without Deleting the Group When creating a new team, you have the option to use an existing Office 365 group, as  shown in Figure 8-3. This is beneficial if your group members are certain that they want  to use Teams as a replacement for Office 365 Groups. However, if users change their  mind and decide they would like to go back to only using the original Office 365 group,  there is an important issue. There is no way to disembark a group from a team. This  means that if you delete the team, you also delete the pre-existing group with it.  129   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-3.  The option to create a team from an existing Office 365 group  Caution  there is no way to detach a group from a team at this time. Be certain  that you want to convert your existing groups to teams.   Teams Can Be Slow Microsoft Teams users need a solid Internet connection and a relatively powerful  computer to use Teams successfully. Depending on what you are doing in Microsoft  Teams, the amount of resources the Teams client uses can vary. It is important to note  that Teams runs multiple processes at the same time. If you think about it, Teams is  somewhat like trying to run Skype for Business, OneDrive for Business, Outlook, and any  other application connected to it at the same time. Similar to Slack, it uses a lot of your  computer’s resources. For a comparison of how the Teams client works compared with  Slack, see Figure 8-4. Microsoft is working on performance improvements, but what they  are working on specifically and how much will improve are unknown at this time.  130   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-4.  The amount of memory Teams and Slack take up with no activity  Issues with Communicating in Teams Now let’s move on to some the challenges you may face while communicating in  Microsoft Teams.   Channel Email Addresses As discussed earlier in the book, a channel comes with an email address to send to. This  is great for making sure that an email is kept with the team and not a user’s email box. If  others are going to use this email address on a longer-term basis, the need for a simple   131   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  and memorable email address might be of value. An example of an automatically created  email address is seen in Figure 8-5. Unfortunately, the channel email address cannot be  changed. Additionally, if you select Remove email address because you don’t want others  to email this channel, you cannot restore the email address at a later time. This could be  a known issue or a feature that Microsoft is working to fix, but for now, it is best to not  remove the email address unless you are certain you will not want to use the feature again.  Also, the emails that are rendered on the channel as messages are not available for  Security and Compliance content search. Let’s say an organization became involved in  a legal issue, your team’s content is related to it. Administrators can use the eDiscovery  and content search features in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center to find  information regarding the legal issue. Unfortunately, if the content you need was sent to  the team in email format, your administrator will not be able to find email content sent  to the team. At time of this book’s writing, Microsoft is currently working on this issue.  Figure 8-5.  A channel email address is pre-created by Teams for you  132   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Caution  deleting a channel email address appears to be permanent; it is not  recoverable.   Skype and Teams Interaction Not all Skype for Business features are at parity with Microsoft Teams. It is possible that  in some organizations, users have both Skype for Business  online or on-premises   and Microsoft Teams running simultaneously. An example of this is seen in Figure 8-6.  Although Microsoft is currently working for feature parity between Microsoft Teams and  Skype for Business Online Skype for Business On-Premises, at the time of this book’s  writing, it was not available.  Figure 8-6.  Matthew’s Teams interface and Jenny’s Skype for Business Online chat  box not staying in sync  Caution  when users chat with different clients  one person has skype for  Business online and one person is using teams , not all of the features will work.  133    Known Challenges and the Future  Chapter 8   User Presence There are a couple of issues with the user presence indicator. The first issue is related  to the disconnect between Skype for Business and Microsoft Teams. As you can see in  Figure 8-7, if a user is online in Skype for Business, it displays a green light that indicates  their user presence. If a user is online using Microsoft Teams, however, the same does  not apply. It is best to not rely on these indicators until full feature parity between Skype  for Business and Microsoft Teams arrives.  Figure 8-7.  Other Office applications can detect Skype for Business Online’s user  presence but not a Teams’ user presence 134   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  The other issue with Skype presence is that there are not any settings to change your   presence in Microsoft Teams the way that there is in Skype for Business. With Skype for  Business  as long as your administrator has not locked the field , you can change the  length of time before your presence indicator turns to yellow, which signifies that you are  away. In Microsoft Teams, you do not have this option, and as you can see in Figure 8- 8,  the presence indicator is not synched, thus giving the impression that you are not available  when you actually are.  Figure 8-8.  Shows the presence indicator of Skype for Business and Teams not  staying synchronized   Bot Communications As an end user, you may not be concerned with what you say to a bot, such as you see in  Figure 8-9. As an administrator, you want to know that conversations between a user and  a bot are not being recorded in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center the way that  user chats are. Neither are connection conversations. An end user may feel the effects  of this issue if the administrator decides it makes Microsoft Teams incompliant with the  governance policies in your organization.  135   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-9.  Example of messages between a user and the T-Bot. These messages  are not currently kept in the Office 365 Security & Compliance administration  center. We were told that this is a bug Microsoft is looking into.   Compact Chat Layout Some users may only want to use the chat or IM functionality of Microsoft Teams. The  issue here is that you cannot collapse the Microsoft Teams interface to a compact size  comparable to that of other chat services. There has been feedback stating that some  users only want the compact display of chats. Although you can shrink or minimize  the Teams’ application window size on your desktop, it won’t be as small as a Skype  for Business chat box, as seen in Figure 8-10. You have to scroll a bit to see an entire  Teams chat. Microsoft is aware of this issue, and the company is currently working on  improvements.  136   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-10.  Comparison of Teams minimized to the smallest setting compared to  the existing Skype for Business chat box   Issues with Meeting in Teams There are a few known issues with meetings in Microsoft Teams, so let’s quickly review  them.   Calendar If you create an Office 365 Group, you are most likely doing it from the Outlook interface.  In Outlook, you have the option to control the calendar in a way that you would expect  of the calendaring features from Microsoft. In Microsoft Teams, you are limited to a daily  view that only goes out to the end of the current week. This means that users are not  able to get a full picture of all the team events, which impacts planning deadlines and  meetings. Although you could add the calendar in a tab via a web link to the Office 365  mailbox, it isn’t as easy to understand with the calendar being so prevalent on the right  side of the meetings area, such as seen in Figure 8-11. This feature request is currently  under review by Microsoft.  137   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Figure 8-11.  An example of the Team calendar, which only has one view for the  day and a limit of seeing the events past the end of the week  Issues with Governing Teams In this section, we review some known issues with governing Microsoft Teams.   Team Deletion There is no way to prevent an owner from deleting their own team. This may or may  not be a concern in your organization. As an alternative solution, as an Office 365  administrator, you can monitor teams being deleted. The administrator can place an  alert in the Security & Compliance Center to send an email to a specific person if a  team is deleted. The team is recoverable for 30 days after the date that it was deleted.  Unfortunately, if you are an end user, you most likely do not have permission to the  Office 365 admin center. You will need to ask for your team to be restored. 138   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Caution  If preventing users in your organization from deleting a team is needed,  consider asking an administrator to create a script that searches the soft deletion  bin or to apply an audit log event alert.   Planned Roadmap Microsoft is investing a great deal of money and effort into the Teams application. At  time of writing, the planned addition of new features and capabilities is extensive, as  shown in Table 1-1. Additionally, Microsoft is working on other features that are not  listed here but are periodically released. The “continuous learning” concept greatly  applies to Teams—for a few years at least. You can review the Teams’ planned roadmap  in Table 1-1.  Table 1-1.

We personally feel that the company realizes that if it doesn’t listen  to its customers, who are paying for the products, it will eventually lose them. That said,  a fair number of new features have come from user feedback on the UserVoice website  at https:  microsoftteams.uservoice.com forums 555103-public  see Figure 8-12 .  Microsoft actively monitors user requests and responds on the site. Some requests are  accepted, some are declined, some are investigated, and some are put on the backlog.   140   Chapter 8    Known Challenges and the Future  Although there is no guarantee that a request will be addressed, the more popular ones  seem to receive some type of notation. In any case, take a look at the UserVoice website;  you can voice your opinion or vote on an idea that is important to you.  Figure 8-12.  Showing the UserVoice website, where new suggestions for Microsoft  Teams are tracked between product users and Microsoft employees   Summary We have covered existing issues, user frustrations, and planned updates for Microsoft  Teams in this chapter. Additionally, we provided an extensive end user guide to practical  usage, collaboration, and governance within Microsoft Teams.  Microsoft Teams is one of the first applications that Microsoft released with the   concept of an agile, continuous delivery concept. This means that we all have to keep  our eyes open when using Microsoft Teams, as it will change often. By deciding to use  Microsoft Teams, you have taken a step in the right direction toward transforming  collaboration and communication with your teammates.  141   Index  A Adobe Sign, 2 Audio conference, 64 Automating business processes, 113  B Bots  communications, 135, 136 definition, 113 example of apps with, 114 installing, 118, 119 polling, 117 scheduling meetings, 117 task management, 117 T-Bot, 115 Teams App Store, 116 Business Online, 133, 135  C Channels  adding, 18 application navigation, 18 deletion, 20 editing, 20 email address, 21, 131, 133 favoriting, 24 following, 25  link, 23 managing, 25 meetings  benefits, 62 scheduling, 63  restoring, 21  Chat  Emojis, 48 GIFs, 50 message formatting options, 47 real-time communication, 46 searching, message, 51 stickers, 49 video calls, 53 voice calls, 52  Chat layout, 136, 137 Cloud storage, 105 Collaboration tool, 76  D Decision maker, 101  E Email  channel addresses, 131, 133 integration, 104, 109, 110  Exchange Online, 9    Melissa Hubbard, Matthew J.
