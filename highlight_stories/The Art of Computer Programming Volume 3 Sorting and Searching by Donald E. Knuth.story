THE CLASSIC WORK  NEWLY UPDATED AND REVISED  The Art of Computer  Programming  VOLUME 3 Sorting and Searching Second Edition  DONALD  E. KNUTH  Volume 1  Fundamental Algorithms Third Edition  0-201-89683-4   This first volume begins with basic programming  concepts and techniques, then focuses on   information structures—the representation   of information inside a computer, the structural  relationships between data elements and how  to deal with them efficiently. Elementary   applications are given to simulation, numerical  methods, symbolic computing, software and  system design.    Volume 2  Seminumerical Algorithms Third Edition  0-201-89684-2   The second volume offers a complete   introduction to the field of seminumerical   algorithms, with separate chapters on random  numbers and arithmetic. The book summarizes  the major paradigms and basic theory of such  algorithms, thereby providing a comprehensive  interface between computer programming   and numerical analysis.    Volume 3  Sorting and Searching Second Edition  0-201-89685-0   The third volume comprises the most   comprehensive survey of classical computer  techniques for sorting and searching. It extends  the treatment of data structures in Volume 1  to consider both large and small databases and  internal and external memories.    Volume 4A   Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1   0-201-03804-8   This volume introduces techniques that allow  computers to deal efficiently with gigantic   problems. Its coverage begins with Boolean  functions and bitwise tricks and techniques,  then treats in depth the generation of all   tuples and permutations, all combinations   and partitions, and all trees.

The title “Sorting and Searching” may sound as if this book is only for those systems programmers who are concerned with the preparation of general-purpose sorting routines or applications to information retrieval. But in fact the area of sorting and searching provides an ideal framework for discussing a wide variety of important general issues:    How are good algorithms discovered?   How can given algorithms and programs be improved?   How can the efficiency of algorithms be analyzed mathematically?   How can a person choose rationally between different algorithms for the   In what senses can algorithms be proved “best possible”?   How does the theory of computing interact with practical considerations?   How can external memories like tapes, drums, or disks be used efficiently  same task?  with large databases?  Indeed, I believe that virtually every important aspect of programming arises somewhere in the context of sorting or searching!  This volume comprises Chapters 5 and 6 of the complete series. Chapter 5 is concerned with sorting into order; this is a large subject that has been divided chiefly into two parts, internal sorting and external sorting. There also are supplementary sections, which develop auxiliary theories about permutations  Section 5.1  and about optimum techniques for sorting  Section 5.3 . Chapter 6 deals with the problem of searching for specified items in tables or files; this is subdivided into methods that search sequentially, or by comparison of keys, or by digital properties, or by hashing, and then the more difficult problem of secondary key retrieval is considered. There is a surprising amount of interplay  v   vi  PREFACE  between both chapters, with strong analogies tying the topics together. Two important varieties of information structures are also discussed, in addition to those considered in Chapter 2, namely priority queues  Section 5.2.3  and linear lists represented as balanced trees  Section 6.2.3 .  Like Volumes 1 and 2, this book includes a lot of material that does not appear in other publications. Many people have kindly written to me about their ideas, or spoken to me about them, and I hope that I have not distorted the material too badly when I have presented it in my own words.  I have not had time to search the patent literature systematically; indeed, I decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms  see Section 5.4.5 . If somebody sends me a copy of a relevant patent not presently cited in this book, I will dutifully refer to it in future editions. However, I want to encourage people to continue the centuries-old mathematical tradition of putting newly discovered algorithms into the public domain. There are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of one’s contributions to computer science.  Before I retired from teaching, I used this book as a text for a student’s second course in data structures, at the junior-to-graduate level, omitting most of the mathematical material. I also used the mathematical portions of this book as the basis for graduate-level courses in the analysis of algorithms, emphasizing especially Sections 5.1, 5.2.2, 6.3, and 6.4. A graduate-level course on concrete computational complexity could also be based on Sections 5.3, and 5.4.4, together with Sections 4.3.3, 4.6.3, and 4.6.4 of Volume 2.  For the most part this book is self-contained, except for occasional discus- sions relating to the MIX computer explained in Volume 1. Appendix B contains a summary of the mathematical notations used, some of which are a little different from those found in traditional mathematics books.  Preface to the Second Edition This new edition matches the third editions of Volumes 1 and 2, in which I have  been able to celebrate the completion of TEX and cid:77  cid:69  cid:84  cid:65  cid:70  cid:79  cid:78  cid:84  by applying those  systems to the publications they were designed for.  The conversion to electronic format has given me the opportunity to go over every word of the text and every punctuation mark. I’ve tried to retain the youthful exuberance of my original sentences while perhaps adding some more mature judgment. Dozens of new exercises have been added; dozens of old exercises have been given new and improved answers. Changes appear everywhere, but most significantly in Sections 5.1.4  about permutations and tableaux , 5.3  about optimum sorting , 5.4.9  about disk sorting , 6.2.2  about entropy , 6.4  about universal hashing , and 6.5  about multidimensional trees and tries .   PREFACE  vii  The Art of Computer Programming is, however, still a work in progress. Research on sorting and searching continues to grow at a phenomenal rate. Therefore some parts of this book are headed by an “under construction” icon, to apologize for the fact that the material is not up-to-date. For example, if I were teaching an undergraduate class on data structures today, I would surely discuss randomized structures such as treaps at some length; but at present, I am only able to cite the principal papers on the subject, and to announce plans for a future Section 6.2.5  see page 478 . My files are bursting with important material that I plan to include in the final, glorious, third edition of Volume 3, perhaps 17 years from now. But I must finish Volumes 4 and 5 first, and I do not want to delay their publication any more than absolutely necessary.  I am enormously grateful to the many hundreds of people who have helped me to gather and refine this material during the past 35 years. Most of the hard work of preparing the new edition was accomplished by Phyllis Winkler  who put the text of the first edition into TEX form , by Silvio Levy  who edited it extensively and helped to prepare several dozen illustrations , and by Jeffrey Oldham  who converted more than 250 of the original illustrations to METAPOST format . The production staff at Addison–Wesley has also been extremely helpful, as usual.  I have corrected every error that alert readers detected in the first edition — as well as some mistakes that, alas, nobody noticed — and I have tried to avoid introducing new errors in the new material. However, I suppose some defects still remain, and I want to fix them as soon as possible. Therefore I will cheerfully award $2.56 to the first finder of each technical, typographical, or historical error. The webpage cited on page iv contains a current listing of all corrections that have been reported to me. Stanford, California February 1998  D. E. K.

It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to learn a subject purely by reading about it, without applying the information to specific problems and thereby being encouraged to think about what has been read. Furthermore, we all learn best the things that we have discovered for ourselves. Therefore the exercises form a major part of this work; a definite attempt has been made to keep them as informative as possible and to select problems that are enjoyable as well as instructive.  In many books, easy exercises are found mixed randomly among extremely difficult ones. A motley mixture is, however, often unfortunate because readers like to know in advance how long a problem ought to take — otherwise they may just skip over all the problems. A classic example of such a situation is the book Dynamic Programming by Richard Bellman; this is an important, pioneering work in which a group of problems is collected together at the end of some chapters under the heading “Exercises and Research Problems,” with extremely trivial questions appearing in the midst of deep, unsolved problems. It is rumored that someone once asked Dr. Bellman how to tell the exercises apart from the research problems, and he replied, “If you can solve it, it is an exercise; otherwise it’s a research problem.”  Good arguments can be made for including both research problems and very easy exercises in a book of this kind; therefore, to save the reader from the possible dilemma of determining which are which, rating numbers have been provided to indicate the level of difficulty. These numbers have the following general significance: Rating  Interpretation  00 An extremely easy exercise that can be answered immediately if the material of the text has been understood; such an exercise can almost always be worked “in your head.”  10 A simple problem that makes you think over the material just read, but is by no means difficult. You should be able to do this in one minute at most; pencil and paper may be useful in obtaining the solution.  20 An average problem that tests basic understanding of the text mate- rial, but you may need about fifteen or twenty minutes to answer it completely.  ix   x  NOTES ON THE EXERCISES  30 A problem of moderate difficulty and or complexity; this one may involve more than two hours’ work to solve satisfactorily, or even more if the TV is on.  40 Quite a difficult or lengthy problem that would be suitable for a term project in classroom situations. A student should be able to solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time, but the solution is not trivial. 50 A research problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily, as far as the author knew at the time of writing, although many people have tried. If you have found an answer to such a problem, you ought to write it up for publication; furthermore, the author of this book would appreciate hearing about the solution as soon as possible  provided that it is correct .  By interpolation in this “logarithmic” scale, the significance of other rating numbers becomes clear. For example, a rating of 17 would indicate an exercise that is a bit simpler than average. Problems with a rating of 50 that are subsequently solved by some reader may appear with a 40 rating in later editions of the book, and in the errata posted on the Internet  see page iv .  The remainder of the rating number divided by 5 indicates the amount of detailed work required. Thus, an exercise rated 24 may take longer to solve than an exercise that is rated 25, but the latter will require more creativity. All exercises with ratings of 46 or more are open problems for future research, rated according to the number of different attacks that they’ve resisted so far.  The author has tried earnestly to assign accurate rating numbers, but it is difficult for the person who makes up a problem to know just how formidable it will be for someone else to find a solution; and everyone has more aptitude for certain types of problems than for others. It is hoped that the rating numbers represent a good guess at the level of difficulty, but they should be taken as general guidelines, not as absolute indicators.  This book has been written for readers with varying degrees of mathematical training and sophistication; as a result, some of the exercises are intended only for the use of more mathematically inclined readers. The rating is preceded by an M if the exercise involves mathematical concepts or motivation to a greater extent than necessary for someone who is primarily interested only in programming the algorithms themselves. An exercise is marked with the letters “HM” if its solution necessarily involves a knowledge of calculus or other higher mathematics not developed in this book. An “HM” designation does not necessarily imply difficulty.  Some exercises are preceded by an arrowhead, “ cid:120 ”; this designates prob-  lems that are especially instructive and especially recommended. Of course, no reader student is expected to work all of the exercises, so those that seem to be the most valuable have been singled out.  This distinction is not meant to detract from the other exercises!  Each reader should at least make an attempt to solve all of the problems whose rating is 10 or less; and the arrows may help to indicate which of the problems with a higher rating should be given priority.   NOTES ON THE EXERCISES  xi  Solutions to most of the exercises appear in the answer section. Please use them wisely; do not turn to the answer until you have made a genuine effort to solve the problem by yourself, or unless you absolutely do not have time to work this particular problem. After getting your own solution or giving the problem a decent try, you may find the answer instructive and helpful. The solution given will often be quite short, and it will sketch the details under the assumption that you have earnestly tried to solve it by your own means first. Sometimes the solution gives less information than was asked; often it gives more. It is quite possible that you may have a better answer than the one published here, or you may have found an error in the published solution; in such a case, the author will be pleased to know the details. Later printings of this book will give the improved solutions together with the solver’s name where appropriate.  When working an exercise you may generally use the answers to previous exercises, unless specifically forbidden from doing so. The rating numbers have been assigned with this in mind; thus it is possible for exercise n + 1 to have a lower rating than exercise n, even though it includes the result of exercise n as a special case.

We merely arrange a list and look for duplications.” — PERRY MASON, in The Case of the Angry Mourner  1951   “Treesort” Computer — With this new ‘computer-approach’ to nature study you can quickly identify over 260 different trees of U.S., Alaska, and Canada, even palms, desert trees, and other exotics. To sort, you simply insert the needle. — EDMUND SCIENTIFIC COMPANY, Catalog  1964   In this chapter we shall study a topic that arises frequently in programming: the rearrangement of items into ascending or descending order. Imagine how hard it would be to use a dictionary if its words were not alphabetized! We will see that, in a similar way, the order in which items are stored in computer memory often has a profound influence on the speed and simplicity of algorithms that manipulate those items.  Although dictionaries of the English language define “sorting” as the process of separating or arranging things according to class or kind, computer program- mers traditionally use the word in the much more special sense of marshaling things into ascending or descending order. The process should perhaps be called ordering, not sorting; but anyone who tries to call it “ordering” is soon led into confusion because of the many different meanings attached to that word. Consider the following sentence, for example: “Since only two of our tape drives were in working order, I was ordered to order more tape units in short order, in order to order the data several orders of magnitude faster.” Mathematical terminology abounds with still more senses of order  the order of a group, the order of a permutation, the order of a branch point, relations of order, etc., etc. . Thus we find that the word “order” can lead to chaos.  Some people have suggested that “sequencing” would be the best name for the process of sorting into order; but this word often seems to lack the right  1   2  SORTING  5  connotation, especially when equal elements are present, and it occasionally conflicts with other terminology. It is quite true that “sorting” is itself an overused word  “I was sort of out of sorts after sorting that sort of data” , but it has become firmly established in computing parlance. Therefore we shall use the word “sorting” chiefly in the strict sense of sorting into order, without further apologies.  Some of the most important applications of sorting are:  a  Solving the “togetherness” problem, in which all items with the same identi- fication are brought together. Suppose that we have 10000 items in arbitrary order, many of which have equal values; and suppose that we want to rearrange the data so that all items with equal values appear in consecutive positions. This is essentially the problem of sorting in the older sense of the word; and it can be solved easily by sorting the file in the new sense of the word, so that the values are in ascending order, v1 ≤ v2 ≤ ··· ≤ v10000. The efficiency achievable in this procedure explains why the original meaning of “sorting” has changed. b  Matching items in two or more files. If several files have been sorted into the same order, it is possible to find all of the matching entries in one sequential pass through them, without backing up. This is the principle that Perry Mason used to help solve a murder case  see the quotation at the beginning of this chapter . We can usually process a list of information most quickly by traversing it in sequence from beginning to end, instead of skipping around at random in the list, unless the entire list is small enough to fit in a high-speed random-access memory. Sorting makes it possible to use sequential accessing on large files, as a feasible substitute for direct addressing. c  Searching for information by key values. Sorting is also an aid to searching, as we shall see in Chapter 6, hence it helps us make computer output more suitable for human consumption. In fact, a listing that has been sorted into alphabetic order often looks quite authoritative even when the associated nu- merical information has been incorrectly computed.  Although sorting has traditionally been used mostly for business data pro- cessing, it is actually a basic tool that every programmer should keep in mind for use in a wide variety of situations. We have discussed its use for simplify- ing algebraic formulas, in exercise 2.3.2–17. The exercises below illustrate the diversity of typical applications.  One of the first large-scale software systems to demonstrate the versatility of sorting was the LARC Scientific Compiler developed by J. Erdwinn, D. E. Ferguson, and their associates at Computer Sciences Corporation in 1960. This optimizing compiler for an extended FORTRAN language made heavy use of sorting so that the various compilation algorithms were presented with relevant parts of the source program in a convenient sequence. The first pass was a lexical scan that divided the FORTRAN source code into individual tokens, each representing an identifier or a constant or an operator, etc. Each token was assigned several sequence numbers; when sorted on the name and an appropriate sequence number, all the uses of a given identifier were brought together. The   5  SORTING  3  “defining entries” by which a user would specify whether an identifier stood for a function name, a parameter, or a dimensioned variable were given low sequence numbers, so that they would appear first among the tokens having a given identifier; this made it easy to check for conflicting usage and to allocate storage with respect to EQUIVALENCE declarations. The information thus gathered about each identifier was now attached to each token; in this way no “symbol table” of identifiers needed to be maintained in the high-speed memory. The updated tokens were then sorted on another sequence number, which essentially brought the source program back into its original order except that the numbering scheme was cleverly designed to put arithmetic expressions into a more convenient “Polish prefix” form. Sorting was also used in later phases of compilation, to facilitate loop optimization, to merge error messages into the listing, etc. In short, the compiler was designed so that virtually all the processing could be done sequentially from files that were stored in an auxiliary drum memory, since appropriate sequence numbers were attached to the data in such a way that it could be sorted into various convenient arrangements.  Computer manufacturers of the 1960s estimated that more than 25 percent of the running time on their computers was spent on sorting, when all their customers were taken into account. In fact, there were many installations in which the task of sorting was responsible for more than half of the computing time. From these statistics we may conclude that either  i  there are many important applications of sorting, or  ii  many people sort when they shouldn’t, or  iii  inefficient sorting algorithms have been in common use. The real truth probably involves all three of these possibilities, but in any event we can see that sorting is worthy of serious study, as a practical matter.  Even if sorting were almost useless, there would be plenty of rewarding rea- sons for studying it anyway! The ingenious algorithms that have been discovered show that sorting is an extremely interesting topic to explore in its own right. Many fascinating unsolved problems remain in this area, as well as quite a few solved ones.  From a broader perspective we will find also that sorting algorithms make a valuable case study of how to attack computer programming problems in general. Many important principles of data structure manipulation will be illustrated in this chapter. We will be examining the evolution of various sorting techniques in an attempt to indicate how the ideas were discovered in the first place. By extrapolating this case study we can learn a good deal about strategies that help us design good algorithms for other computer problems.  Sorting techniques also provide excellent illustrations of the general ideas involved in the analysis of algorithms — the ideas used to determine performance characteristics of algorithms so that an intelligent choice can be made between competing methods. Readers who are mathematically inclined will find quite a few instructive techniques in this chapter for estimating the speed of computer algorithms and for solving complicated recurrence relations. On the other hand, the material has been arranged so that readers without a mathematical bent can safely skip over these calculations.   4  SORTING  5  Before going on, we ought to define our problem a little more clearly, and  introduce some terminology. We are given N items  R1, R2, . . . , RN  to be sorted; we shall call them records, and the entire collection of N records will be called a file. Each record Rj has a key, Kj, which governs the sorting process. Additional data, besides the key, is usually also present; this extra “satellite information” has no effect on sorting except that it must be carried along as part of each record.  An ordering relation “<” is specified on the keys so that the following  conditions are satisfied for any key values a, b, c:  i  Exactly one of the possibilities a < b, a = b, b < a is true.  This is called  the law of trichotomy.   ii  If a < b and b < c, then a < c.  This is the familiar law of transitivity.  Properties  i  and  ii  characterize the mathematical concept of linear ordering, also called total ordering. Any relationship “<” satisfying these two properties can be sorted by most of the methods to be mentioned in this chapter, although some sorting techniques are designed to work only with numerical or alphabetic keys that have the usual ordering. indices {1, 2, . . . , N} that will put the keys into nondecreasing order:  The goal of sorting is to determine a permutation p 1  p 2  . . . p N  of the  Kp 1  ≤ Kp 2  ≤ ··· ≤ Kp N .   1  The sorting is called stable if we make the further requirement that records with equal keys should retain their original relative order. In other words, stable sorting has the additional property that  p i  < p j   and i < j.  whenever Kp i  = Kp j    2  In some cases we will want the records to be physically rearranged in storage so that their keys are in order. But in other cases it will be sufficient merely to have an auxiliary table that specifies the permutation in some way, so that the records can be accessed in order of their keys. A few of the sorting methods in this chapter assume the existence of either or both of the values “∞” and “−∞”, which are defined to be greater than or less than all keys, respectively:  for 1 ≤ j ≤ N .  −∞ < Kj < ∞,   3  Such extreme values are occasionally used as artificial keys or as sentinel indica- tors. The case of equality is excluded in  3 ; if equality can occur, the algorithms can be modified so that they will still work, but usually at the expense of some elegance and efficiency.  Sorting can be classified generally into internal sorting, in which the records are kept entirely in the computer’s high-speed random-access memory, and ex- ternal sorting, when more records are present than can be held comfortably in   5  SORTING  5  memory at once. Internal sorting allows more flexibility in the structuring and accessing of the data, while external sorting shows us how to live with rather stringent accessing constraints.  The time required to sort N records, using a decent general-purpose sorting algorithm, is roughly proportional to N log N; we make about log N “passes” over the data. This is the minimum possible time, as we shall see in Section 5.3.1, if the records are in random order and if sorting is done by pairwise comparisons of keys. Thus if we double the number of records, it will take a little more than twice as long to sort them, all other things being equal.  Actually, as N approaches infinity, a better indication of the time needed to sort is N log N 2, if the keys are distinct, since the size of the keys must grow at least as fast as log N; but for practical purposes, N never really approaches infinity.   On the other hand, if the keys are known to be randomly distributed with respect to some continuous numerical distribution, we will see that sorting can be accomplished in O N  steps on the average.  EXERCISES — First Set 1. [M20] Prove, from the laws of trichotomy and transitivity, that the permutation p 1  p 2  . . . p N  is uniquely determined when the sorting is assumed to be stable. 2. [21] Assume that each record Rj in a certain file contains two keys, a “major key” Kj and a “minor key” kj, with a linear ordering < defined on each of the sets of keys. Then we can define lexicographic order between pairs of keys  K, k  in the usual way:   Ki, ki  <  Kj, kj   if Ki < Kj  or if Ki = Kj  and ki < kj.  Alice took this file and sorted it first on the major keys, obtaining n groups of  records with equal major keys in each group,  Kp 1  = ··· = Kp i1  < Kp i1+1  = ··· = Kp i2  < ··· < Kp in−1+1  = ··· = Kp in ,  where in = N. Then she sorted each of the n groups Rp ij−1+1 , . . . , Rp ij  on their minor keys.  Bill took the same original file and sorted it first on the minor keys; then he took  the resulting file, and sorted it on the major keys.  Chris took the same original file and did a single sorting operation on it, using  lexicographic order on the major and minor keys  Kj, kj .  Did everyone obtain the same result?  3. [M25] Let < be a relation on K1, . . . , KN that satisfies the law of trichotomy but not the transitive law. Prove that even without the transitive law it is possible to sort the records in a stable manner, meeting conditions  1  and  2 ; in fact, there are at least three arrangements that satisfy the conditions!   cid:120  4. [21] Lexicographers don’t actually use strict lexicographic order in dictionaries,  because uppercase and lowercase letters must be interfiled. Thus they want an ordering such as this:  a < A < aa < AA < AAA < Aachen < aah < ··· < zzz < ZZZ.  Explain how to implement dictionary order.   6  SORTING   cid:120  5. [M28] Design a binary code for all nonnegative integers so that if n is encoded as  5  the string ρ n  we have m < n if and only if ρ m  is lexicographically less than ρ n . Moreover, ρ m  should not be a prefix of ρ n  for any m ̸= n. If possible, the length of ρ n  should be at most lg n + O log log n  for all large n.  Such a code is useful if we want to sort texts that mix words and numbers, or if we want to map arbitrarily large alphabets into binary strings.  6. [15] Mr. B. C. Dull  a MIX programmer  wanted to know if the number stored in location A is greater than, less than, or equal to the number stored in location B. So he wrote ‘LDA A; SUB B’ and tested whether register A was positive, negative, or zero. What serious mistake did he make, and what should he have done instead? 7. [17] Write a MIX subroutine for multiprecision comparison of keys, having the following specifications: Calling sequence: JMP COMPARE Entry conditions: rI1 = n; CONTENTS A + k  = ak and CONTENTS B + k  = bk, for  1 ≤ k ≤ n; assume that n ≥ 1.  Exit conditions: CI = GREATER, if  an, . . . , a1  >  bn, . . . , b1 ; if  an, . . . , a1  =  bn, . . . , b1 ; if  an, . . . , a1  <  bn, . . . , b1 ;  CI = EQUAL, CI = LESS, rX and rI1 are possibly affected.  Here the relation  an, . . . , a1  <  bn, . . . , b1  denotes lexicographic ordering from left to right; that is, there is an index j such that ak = bk for n ≥ k > j, but aj < bj.   cid:120  8. [30] Locations A and B contain two numbers a and b, respectively. Show that it is  possible to write a MIX program that computes and stores min a, b  in location C, without using any jump operators.  Caution: Since you will not be able to test whether or not arithmetic overflow has occurred, it is wise to guarantee that overflow is impossible regardless of the values of a and b.  9. [M27] After N independent, uniformly distributed random variables between 0 and 1 have been sorted into nondecreasing order, what is the probability that the rth smallest of these numbers is ≤ x?  EXERCISES — Second Set Each of the following exercises states a problem that a computer programmer might have had to solve in the old days when computers didn’t have much random-access memory. Suggest a “good” way to solve the problem, assuming that only a few thousand words of internal memory are available, supplemented by about half a dozen tape units  enough tape units for sorting . Algorithms that work well under such limitations also prove to be efficient on modern machines. 10. [15] You are given a tape containing one million words of data. How do you determine how many distinct words are present on the tape? 11. [18] You are the U. S. Internal Revenue Service; you receive millions of “informa- tion” forms from organizations telling how much income they have paid to people, and millions of “tax” forms from people telling how much income they have been paid. How do you catch people who don’t report all of their income? 12. [M25]  Transposing a matrix.  You are given a magnetic tape containing one million words, representing the elements of a 1000×1000 matrix stored in order by rows: a1,1 a1,2 . . . a1,1000 a2,1 . . . a2,1000 . . . a1000,1000. How do you create a tape in which the   5  SORTING  7  elements are stored by columns a1,1 a2,1 . . . a1000,1 a1,2 . . . a1000,2 . . . a1000,1000 instead?  Try to make less than a dozen passes over the data.  13. [M26] How could you “shuffle” a large file of N words into a random rearrange- ment? 14. [20] You are working with two computer systems that have different conventions for the “collating sequence” that defines the ordering of alphameric characters. How do you make one computer sort alphameric files in the order used by the other computer? 15. [18] You are given a list of the names of a fairly large number of people born in the U.S.A., together with the name of the state where they were born. How do you count the number of people born in each state?  Assume that nobody appears in the list more than once.  16. [20] In order to make it easier to make changes to large FORTRAN programs, you want to design a “cross-reference” routine; such a routine takes FORTRAN programs as input and prints them together with an index that shows each use of each identifier  that is, each name  in the program. How should such a routine be designed?   cid:120  17. [33]  Library card sorting.  Before the days of computerized databases, every  library maintained a catalog of cards so that users could find the books they wanted. But the task of putting catalog cards into an order convenient for human use turned out to be quite complicated as library collections grew.

[M25]  E. T. Parker.  Leonhard Euler once conjectured [Nova Acta Acad. Sci. Petropolitanæ 13  1795 , 45–63, §3; written in 1778] that there are no solutions to the equation  6 + v  6 + w  6 + x  6 + y  6 = z  6  u  in positive integers u, v, w, x, y, z. At the same time he conjectured that  1 + ··· + xn xn  n−1 = xn  n  would have no positive integer solutions, for all n ≥ 3, but this more general conjecture was disproved by the computer-discovered identity 275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445; see L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and J. L. Selfridge, Math. Comp. 21  1967 , 446–459.   5  SORTING  9  Infinitely many counterexamples when n = 4 were subsequently found by Noam Elkies [Math. Comp. 51  1988 , 825–835]. Can you think of a way in which sorting would help in the search for counterexamples to Euler’s conjecture when n = 6?   cid:120  19. [24] Given a file containing a million or so distinct 30-bit binary words x1, . . . , xN,  what is a good way to find all complementary pairs {xi, xj} that are present?  Two words are complementary when one has 0 wherever the other has 1, and conversely; thus they are complementary if and only if their sum is  11 . . . 1 2, when they are treated as binary numbers.    cid:120  20. [25] Given a file containing 1000 30-bit words x1, . . . , x1000, how would you pre-  pare a list of all pairs  xi, xj  such that xi = xj except in at most two bit positions? 21. [22] How would you go about looking for five-letter anagrams such as CARET, CARTE, CATER, CRATE, REACT, RECTA, TRACE; CRUEL, LUCRE, ULCER; DOWRY, ROWDY, WORDY? [One might wish to know whether there are any sets of ten or more five-letter English anagrams besides the remarkable set  APERS, ASPER, PARES, PARSE, PEARS, PRASE, PRESA, RAPES, REAPS, SPAER, SPARE, SPEAR, to which we might add the French word APRÈS.] 22. [M28] Given the specifications of a fairly large number of directed graphs, what approach will be useful for grouping the isomorphic ones together?  Directed graphs are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and a one-to- one correspondence between their arcs, where the correspondences preserve incidence between vertices and arcs.  23. [30] In a certain group of 4096 people, everyone has about 100 acquaintances. A file has been prepared listing all pairs of people who are acquaintances.  The relation is symmetric: If x is acquainted with y, then y is acquainted with x. Therefore the file contains roughly 200,000 entries.  How would you design an algorithm to list all the k-person cliques in this group of people, given k?  A clique is an instance of mutual acquaintances: Everyone in the clique is acquainted with everyone else.  Assume that there are no cliques of size 25, so the total number of cliques cannot be enormous.   cid:120  24. [30] Three million men with distinct names were laid end-to-end, reaching from  New York to California. Each participant was given a slip of paper on which he wrote down his own name and the name of the person immediately west of him in the line. The man at the extreme western end didn’t understand what to do, so he threw his paper away; the remaining 2,999,999 slips of paper were put into a huge basket and taken to the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Here the contents of the basket were shuffled completely and transferred to magnetic tapes.  At this point an information scientist observed that there was enough information on the tapes to reconstruct the list of people in their original order. And a computer scientist discovered a way to do the reconstruction with fewer than 1000 passes through the data tapes, using only sequential accessing of tape files and a small amount of random-access memory. How was that possible? [In other words, given the pairs  xi, xi+1 , for 1 ≤ i < N, in random order, where the xi are distinct, how can the sequence x1x2 . . . xN be obtained, restricting all operations to serial techniques suitable for use with magnetic tapes? This is the problem of sorting into order when there is no easy way to tell which of two given keys precedes the other; we have already raised this question as part of exercise 2.2.3–25.]   10  SORTING  5  25. [M21]  Discrete logarithms.  You know that p is a  rather large  prime number, and that a is a primitive root modulo p. Therefore, for all b in the range 1 ≤ b < p, there is a unique n such that an mod p = b, 1 ≤ n < p.  This n is called the index of b modulo p, with respect to a.

COMBINATORIAL PROPERTIES OF PERMUTATIONS A permutation of a finite set is an arrangement of its elements into a row. Permutations are of special importance in the study of sorting algorithms, since they represent the unsorted input data. In order to study the efficiency of different sorting methods, we will want to be able to count the number of permutations that cause a certain step of a sorting procedure to be executed a certain number of times.  We have, of course, met permutations frequently in previous chapters. For example, in Section 1.2.5 we discussed two basic theoretical methods of con- structing the n! permutations of n objects; in Section 1.3.3 we analyzed some algorithms dealing with the cycle structure and multiplicative properties of permutations; in Section 3.3.2 we studied their “runs up” and “runs down.” The purpose of the present section is to study several other properties of per- mutations, and to consider the general case where equal elements are allowed to appear. In the course of this study we will learn a good deal about combinatorial mathematics.  The properties of permutations are sufficiently pleasing to be interesting in their own right, and it is convenient to develop them systematically in one place instead of scattering the material throughout this chapter. But readers who are not mathematically inclined and readers who are anxious to dive right into sorting techniques are advised to go on to Section 5.2 immediately, since the present section actually has little direct connection to sorting.  *5.1.1. Inversions Let a1 a2 . . . an be a permutation of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. If i   aj, the pair  ai, aj  is called an inversion of the permutation; for example, the permutation 3 1 4 2 has three inversions:  3, 1 ,  3, 2 , and  4, 2 . Each inversion is a pair of elements that is out of sort, so the only permutation with no inversions is the sorted permutation 1 2 . . . n. This connection with sorting is the chief reason why we will be so interested in inversions, although we have already used the concept to analyze a dynamic storage allocation algorithm  see exercise 2.2.2–9 . The concept of inversions was introduced by G. Cramer in 1750 [Intr. à l’Analyse des Lignes Courbes Algébriques  Geneva: 1750 , 657–659; see Thomas Muir, Theory of Determinants 1  1906 , 11–14], in connection with his famous rule for solving linear equations. In essence, Cramer defined the determinant of an n × n matrix in the following way:   = −1 inv a1a2...an x1a1 x2a2 . . . xnan ,  ...   x11  ...  det  x12  . . . x1n  ...  xn1 xn2  . . . xnn  summed over all permutations a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n}, where inv a1 a2 . . . an  is the number of inversions of the permutation.  The inversion table b1 b2 . . . bn of the permutation a1 a2 . . . an is obtained by letting bj be the number of elements to the left of j that are greater than j.   12  SORTING  5.1.1   1   In other words, bj is the number of inversions whose second component is j. It follows, for example, that the permutation  5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3  has the inversion table  2 3 6 4 0 2 2 1 0,   2  since 5 and 9 are to the left of 1; 5, 9, 8 are to the left of 2; etc. This permutation has 20 inversions in all. By definition the numbers bj will always satisfy bn = 0.  0 ≤ b1 ≤ n − 1,  0 ≤ b2 ≤ n − 2,   3   . . . ,  0 ≤ bn−1 ≤ 1,  Perhaps the most important fact about inversions is the simple observation that an inversion table uniquely determines the corresponding permutation. We can go back from any inversion table b1 b2 . . . bn satisfying  3  to the unique permutation that produces it, by successively determining the relative placement of the elements n, n−1, . . . , 1  in this order . For example, we can construct the permutation corresponding to  2  as follows: Write down the number 9; then place 8 after 9, since b8 = 1. Similarly, put 7 after both 8 and 9, since b7 = 2. Then 6 must follow two of the numbers already written down, because b6 = 2; the partial result so far is therefore  Continue by placing 5 at the left, since b5 = 0; put 4 after four of the numbers; and put 3 after six numbers  namely at the extreme right , giving  9 8 6 7.  5 9 8 6 4 7 3.  The insertion of 2 and 1 in an analogous way yields  1 .  This correspondence is important because we can often translate a problem stated in terms of permutations into an equivalent problem stated in terms of inversion tables, and the latter problem may be easier to solve. For example, consider the simplest question of all: How many permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} are possible? The answer must be the number of possible inversion tables, and they are easily enumerated since there are n choices for b1, independently n−1 choices for b2, . . . , 1 choice for bn, making n n−1  . . . 1 = n! choices in all. Inversions are easy to count, because the b’s are completely independent of each other, while the a’s must be mutually distinct.  In Section 1.2.10 we analyzed the number of local maxima that occur when a permutation is read from right to left; in other words, we counted how many elements are larger than any of their successors.  The right-to-left maxima in  1 , for example, are 3, 7, 8, and 9.  This is the number of j such that bj has its maximum value, n − j. Since b1 will equal n − 1 with probability 1 n, and  independently  b2 will be equal to n − 2 with probability 1  n − 1 , etc., it is clear by consideration of the inversions that the average number of right-to-left   5.1.1  INVERSIONS  13  Fig. 1. The truncated octahedron, which shows the change in inversions when adjacent elements of a permutation are interchanged.  maxima is  1 n  + 1 n − 1 + ··· + 1  1 = Hn.  The corresponding generating function is also easily derived in a similar way.  If we interchange two adjacent elements of a permutation, it is easy to see that the total number of inversions will increase or decrease by unity. Figure 1 shows the 24 permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}, with lines joining permutations that differ by an interchange of adjacent elements; following any line downward inverts exactly one new pair. Hence the number of inversions of a permutation π is the length of a downward path from 1234 to π in Fig. 1; all such paths must have the same length.  Incidentally, the diagram in Fig. 1 may be viewed as a three-dimensional solid, the “truncated octahedron,” which has 8 hexagonal faces and 6 square faces. This is one of the classical uniform polyhedra attributed to Archimedes  see exercise 10 .  The reader should not confuse inversions of a permutation with the inverse  of a permutation. Recall that we can write a permutation in two-line form   1    2  3 a1 a2 a3  . . . n . . . an  ;   4   the inverse a′1 a′2 a′3 . . . a′n of this permutation is the permutation obtained by interchanging the two rows and then sorting the columns into increasing order  1234  2134  1243  2143  2314  1324  3124  2413  1342  3214  2341  3241  2431  3142  1423  1432  4213  4123  4132  4231  3412  3421  4312  4321   14  SORTING  of the new top row:  . . . n . . . a′n For example, the inverse of 5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3 is 3 5 9 7 1 6 8 4 2, since  =  1  3   a1 a2 a3  5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3  . . . an . . . n  2     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  2  3 a′1 a′2 a′3   1  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  3 5 9 7 1 6 8 4 2    .  =    .  5.1.1   5   Another way to define the inverse is to say that a′j = k if and only if ak = j.  The inverse of a permutation was first defined by H. A. Rothe [in Samm- lung combinatorisch-analytischer Abhandlungen, edited by C. F. Hindenburg, 2  Leipzig: 1800 , 263–305], who noticed an interesting connection between inverses and inversions: The inverse of a permutation has exactly as many inversions as the permutation itself. Rothe’s proof of this fact was not the simplest possible one, but it is instructive and quite pretty nevertheless. We construct an n × n chessboard having a dot in column j of row i whenever ai = j. Then we put ×’s in all squares that have dots lying both below  in the same column  and to their right  in the same row . For example, the diagram for 5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3 is  × × × ×   × × × ×    × × ×    × × ×    × ×    × × ×   ×          The number of ×’s is the number of inversions, since it is easy to see that bj is the number of ×’s in column j. Now if we transpose the diagram — interchanging rows and columns — we get the diagram corresponding to the inverse of the original permutation. Hence the number of ×’s  the number of inversions  is the same in both cases. Rothe used this fact to prove that the determinant of a matrix is unchanged when the matrix is transposed.  The analysis of several sorting algorithms involves the knowledge of how many permutations of n elements have exactly k inversions.

A. MacMahon [Amer. J. Math. 35  1913 , 281–322]. Let us define the index of the permutation a1 a2 . . . an as the sum of all subscripts j such that aj > aj+1, 1 ≤ j < n. For example, the index of 5 9 1 8 2 6 4 7 3 is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20. By coincidence the index is the same as the number of inversions in this case. If we list the 24 permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely  So the average number of inversions is rather large, about 1 deviation is also rather large, about 1  = n 2n + 5  n − 1   6 n3 2.   12   1 4  =  +  0  4  ;  .

At first this fact might appear to be almost obvious, but further scrutiny makes it very mysterious. MacMahon gave an ingenious indirect proof, as follows: Let ind a1 a2 . . . an  be the index of the permutation a1 a2 . . . an, and let   14  be the corresponding generating function; the sum in  14  is over all permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}. We wish to show that Hn z  = Gn z . For this purpose we will  zind a1 a2...an   Hn z  =   5.1.1  INVERSIONS  17  define a one-to-one correspondence between arbitrary n-tuples  q1, q2, . . . , qn  of nonnegative integers, on the one hand, and ordered pairs of n-tuples   a1, a2, . . . , an ,  p1, p2, . . . , pn   on the other hand, where a1 a2 . . . an is a permutation of the indices {1, 2, . . . , n} and p1 ≥ p2 ≥ ··· ≥ pn ≥ 0. This correspondence will satisfy the condition  q1 + q2 + ··· + qn = ind a1 a2 . . . an  +  p1 + p2 + ··· + pn .  The generating function zq1+q2+···+qn, summed over all n-tuples of nonnega-  zp1+p2+···+pn, summed over all n-tuples of integers  p1, p2, . . . , pn  such that  tive integers  q1, q2, . . . , qn , is Qn z  = 1  1 − z n; and the generating function p1 ≥ p2 ≥ ··· ≥ pn ≥ 0, is   15   Pn z  = 1  1 − z  1 − z2  . . .  1 − zn ,   16  as shown in exercise 15. In view of  15 , the one-to-one correspondence we are about to establish will prove that Qn z  = Hn z Pn z , that is,  Hn z  = Qn z  Pn z .   17   But Qn z  Pn z  is Gn z , by  8 . The desired correspondence is defined by a simple sorting procedure: Any n-tuple  q1, q2, . . . , qn  can be rearranged into nonincreasing order qa1 ≥ qa2 ≥ ··· ≥ qan in a stable manner, where a1 a2 . . . an is a permutation such that qaj = qaj+1 implies aj < aj+1. We set  p1, p2, . . . , pn  =  qa1 , qa2 , . . . , qan  and then, for 1 ≤ j   aj+1. We still have p1 ≥ p2 ≥ ··· ≥ pn, because pj was strictly greater than pj+1 whenever because the total reduction of the p’s is ind a1 a2 . . . an . For example, if n = 9 and  q1, . . . , q9  =  3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5 , we find a1 . . . a9 = 6 8 5 9 3 1 7 2 4 and  p1, . . . , p9  =  5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 .  aj > aj+1. The resulting pair  a1, a2, . . . , an ,  p1, p2, . . . , pn  satisfies  15 ,  Conversely, we can easily go back to  q1, q2, . . . , qn  when a1 a2 . . . an and  p1, p2, . . . , pn  are given.  See exercise 17.  So the desired correspondence has been established, and MacMahon’s index theorem has been proved.  D. Foata and M. P. Schützenberger discovered a surprising extension of MacMahon’s theorem, about 65 years after MacMahon’s original publication: The number of permutations of n elements that have k inversions and index l is the same as the number that have l inversions and index k. In fact, Foata and Schützenberger found a simple one-to-one correspondence between permutations of the first kind and permutations of the second  see exercise 25 .  EXERCISES 1.

[M20] In the classical problem of Josephus  exercise 1.3.2–22 , n men are initially arranged in a circle; the mth man is executed, the circle closes, and every mth man is repeatedly eliminated until all are dead. The resulting execution order is a permutation   18  SORTING  5.1.1  of {1, 2, . . . , n}. For example, when n = 8 and m = 4 the order is 5 4 6 1 3 8 7 2  man 1 is 5th out, etc. ; the inversion table corresponding to this permutation is 3 6 3 1 0 0 1 0. Give a simple recurrence relation for the elements b1 b2 . . . bn of the inversion table  in the general Josephus problem for n men, when every mth man is executed. 3.

Is there an algorithm whose worst-case running time is substantially better than order n2?   cid:120  6. [26] Design an algorithm that computes the inversion table b1 b2 . . . bn corre-  sponding to a given permutation a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n}, where the running time is essentially proportional to n log n on typical computers. 7. [20] Several other kinds of inversion tables can be defined, corresponding to a given permutation a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n}, besides the particular table b1 b2 . . . bn defined in the text; in this exercise we will consider three other types of inversion tables that arise in applications.  Let cj be the number of inversions whose first component is j, that is, the number of elements to the right of j that are less than j. [Corresponding to  1  we have the table 0 0 0 1 4 2 1 5 7; clearly 0 ≤ cj < j.] Let Bj = baj and Cj = caj . Show that 0 ≤ Bj < j and 0 ≤ Cj ≤ n − j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ n; furthermore show that the permutation a1 a2 . . . an can be determined uniquely when either c1 c2 . . . cn or B1 B2 . . . Bn or C1 C2 . . .

[M24] Continuing the notation of exercise 7, let a′1 a′2 . . . a′n be the inverse of the permutation a1 a2 . . . an, and let the corresponding inversion tables be b′1 b′2 . . . b′n, c′1 c′2 . . . c′n, B′1 B′2 . . .

[HM20] Consider Fig. 1 as a polyhedron in three dimensions. What is the diam- eter of the truncated octahedron  the distance between vertex 1234 and vertex 4321 , if all of its edges have unit length? 11. [M25] If π = a1 a2 . . . an is a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}, let  be the set of its inversions, and let  E π  = { ai, aj   i   aj}  E π  = { ai, aj   i > j, ai > aj}  be the non-inversions. a  Prove that E π  and E π  are transitive.   A set S of ordered pairs is called  transitive if  a, c  is in S whenever both  a, b  and  b, c  are in S.    5.1.1  INVERSIONS  19  b  Conversely, let E be any transitive subset of T = { x, y   1 ≤ y < x ≤ n} whose complement E = T \ E is also transitive. Prove that there exists a permutation π such that E π  = E.  12. [M28] Continuing the notation of the previous exercise, prove that if π1 and π2 are permutations and if E is the smallest transitive set containing E π1 ∪ E π2 , then E is transitive. [Hence, if we say π1 is “above” π2 whenever E π1  ⊆ E π2 , a lattice of permutations is defined; there is a unique “lowest” permutation “above” two given permutations. Figure 1 is the lattice diagram when n = 4.] 13. [M23] It is well known that half of the terms in the expansion of a determinant have a plus sign, and half have a minus sign. In other words, there are just as many permutations with an even number of inversions as with an odd number, when n ≥ 2. Show that, in general, the number of permutations having a number of inversions congruent to t modulo m is n! m, regardless of the integer t, whenever n ≥ m. 14. [M24]  F. Franklin.  A partition of n into k distinct parts is a representation n = p1 + p2 + ··· + pk, where p1 > p2 > ··· > pk > 0. For example, the partitions of 7 into distinct parts are 7, 6 + 1, 5 + 2, 4 + 3, 4 + 2 + 1. Let fk n  be the number of k −1 kfk n  = 0, unless n has the form  3j2 ± j  2, for some nonnegative integer j; in the latter case the sum is  −1 j. For example, when n = 7 the sum is − 1 + 3 − 1 = 1, and 7 =  3 · 22 + 2  2. [Hint: Represent a partition as an array of dots, putting pi dots in the ith row, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Find the smallest j such that pj+1 < pj − 1, and encircle the rightmost dots in the first j rows. If j < pk, these j dots can usually be removed, tilted 45◦, and placed as a new  k+1 st row. On the other hand if j ≥ pk, the kth row of dots can usually be removed, tilted 45◦, and placed to the right of the circled dots.  See Fig. 2.

Let n > 0, and assume that a sequence of 2n n-bit integers X0, . . . , X2n−1 has been generated at random, where each bit of each number is independently equal to 1 with probability p. Consider the sequence X0 ⊕ 0, X1 ⊕ 1, . . . , X2n−1 ⊕  2n − 1 , where ⊕ denotes the “exclusive or” operation on the binary representations. Thus if p = 0, the sequence is 0, 1, . . . , 2n−1, and if p = 1 it is 2n−1, . . . , 1, 0; and when p = 1 2, each element of the sequence is a random integer between 0 and 2n − 1. For general p this is a useful way to generate a sequence of random integers with a biased number of inversions, although the distribution of the elements of the sequence taken as a whole is uniform in the sense that each n-bit integer has the same distribution. What is the average number of inversions in such a sequence, as a function of the probability p? 19. [M28]  C. Meyer.

We may also indicate the multiplicities of elements in another way, namely  M = {a, a, a, b, b, c, d, d, d, d},   2  A permutation* of M is an arrangement of its elements into a row; for example,  M = {3 · a, 2 · b, c, 4 · d}.  c a b d d a b d a d.  From another point of view we would call this a string of letters, containing 3 a’s, 2 b’s, 1 c, and 4 d’s.  How many permutations of M are possible? If we regarded the elements of M as distinct, by subscripting them a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, c1, d1, d2, d3, d4,  * Sometimes called a “permatution.”   5.1.2  PERMUTATIONS OF A MULTISET  23  we would have 10! = 3,628,800 permutations; but many of those permutations would actually be the same when we removed the subscripts. In fact, each permutation of M would occur exactly 3! 2! 1! 4! = 288 times, since we can start with any permutation of M and put subscripts on the a’s in 3! ways, on the b’s  independently  in 2! ways, on the c in 1 way, and on the d’s in 4! ways. Therefore the true number of permutations of M is 3! 2! 1! 4! = 12,600.  10!  In general, we can see by this same argument that the number of permutations of any multiset is the multinomial coefficient      n  n1, n2, . . .  n!  =  n1! n2! . . .  ,   3   where n1 is the number of elements of one kind, n2 is the number of another kind, etc., and n = n1 + n2 + ··· is the total number of elements. The number of permutations of a set has been known for more than 1500 years. The Hebrew Book of Creation  c. A.D. 400 , which was the earliest literary product of Jewish philosophical mysticism, gives the correct values of the first seven factorials, after which it says “Go on and compute what the mouth cannot express and the ear cannot hear.” [Sefer Yetzirah, end of Chapter 4. See Solomon Gandz, Studies in Hebrew Astronomy and Mathematics  New York: Ktav, 1970 , 494–496; Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah  York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, 1993 .] This is one of the first two known enumerations of permutations in history. The other occurs in the Indian classic Anuyogadv¯aras¯utra  c. 500 , rule 97, which gives the formula  6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 − 2  for the number of permutations of six elements that are neither in ascending nor [See G. Chakravarti, Bull. Calcutta Math. Soc. 24  1932 , descending order. 79–88. The Anuyogadv¯aras¯utra is one of the books in the canon of Jainism, a religious sect that flourishes in India.]  The corresponding formula for permutations of multisets seems to have appeared first in the L¯ıl¯avat¯ı of Bh¯askara  c. 1150 , sections 270–271. Bh¯askara stated the rule rather tersely, and illustrated it only with two simple examples {2, 2, 1, 1} and {4, 8, 5, 5, 5}. Consequently the English translations of his work do not all state the rule correctly, although there is little doubt that Bh¯askara knew what he was talking about. He went on to give the interesting formula   4 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 5  × 120 × 11111  5 × 6  for the sum of the 20 numbers 48555 + 45855 + ··· .  The correct rule for counting permutations when elements are repeated was apparently unknown in Europe until Marin Mersenne stated it without proof as Proposition 10 in his elaborate treatise on melodic principles [Harmonie Universelle 2, also entitled Traitez de la Voix et des Chants  1636 , 129–130].   24  SORTING  5.1.2  Mersenne was interested in the number of tunes that could be made from a given collection of notes; he observed, for example, that a theme by Boesset,  can be rearranged in exactly 15!  4!3!3!2!  = 756,756,000 ways.  The general rule  3  also appeared in Jean Prestet’s Élémens des Mathéma- tiques  Paris: 1675 , 351–352, one of the very first expositions of combinatorial mathematics to be written in the Western world. Prestet stated the rule correctly for a general multiset, but illustrated it only in the simple case {a, a, b, b, c, c}. A few years later, John Wallis’s Discourse of Combinations  Oxford: 1685 , Chapter 2  published with his Treatise of Algebra  gave a clearer and somewhat more detailed discussion of the rule.  In 1965, Dominique Foata introduced an ingenious idea called the “inter- calation product,” which makes it possible to extend many of the known results about ordinary permutations to the general case of multiset permutations. [See Publ. Inst. Statistique, Univ. Paris, 14  1965 , 81–241; also Lecture Notes in Math. 85  Springer, 1969 .] Assuming that the elements of a multiset have been linearly ordered in some way, we may consider a two-line notation such as   a a a b b c d d d d    c a b d d a b d a d  ,  where the top line contains the elements of M sorted into nondecreasing order and the bottom line is the permutation itself. The intercalation product α β of two multiset permutations α and β is obtained by  a  expressing α and β in the two-line notation,  b  juxtaposing these two-line representations, and  c  sorting the columns into nondecreasing order of the top line. The sorting is supposed to be stable, in the sense that left-to-right order of elements in the bottom line is preserved when the corresponding top line elements are equal. For example, c a d a b  b d d a d = c a b d d a b d a d, since   a a b c d    a b d d d     a a a b b c d d d d    .   5   c a d a b  b d d a d  c a b d d a b d a d  =  It is easy to see that the intercalation product is associative:  it also satisfies two cancellation laws:   α β  γ = α  β γ ;  π α = π β α π = β π  implies implies  α = β, α = β.  There is an identity element,  α ϵ = ϵ α = α,   4    6    7    8    5.1.2  PERMUTATIONS OF A MULTISET  25  where ϵ is the null permutation, the “arrangement” of the empty set. Although the commutative law is not valid in general  see exercise 2 , we do have  α β = β α   9  In an analogous fashion we can extend the concept of cycles in permutations  if α and β have no letters in common.  to cases where elements are repeated; we let   10  stand for the permutation obtained in two-line form by sorting the columns of   x1 x2  xn   . . .   x1 x2  d b d d a c a a b d  x2 x3  . . . . . .  xn x1      11    a a a b b c d d d d    ,  =  by their top elements in a stable manner. For example, we have    d b d d a c a a b d   =  b d d a c a a b d d  c a b d d a b d a d  so the permutation  4  is actually a cycle. We might render this cycle in words by saying something like “d goes to b goes to d goes to d goes . . . goes to d goes back.” Note that these general cycles do not share all of the properties of ordinary cycles;  x1 x2 . . . xn  is not always the same as  x2 . . . xn x1 .  We observed in Section 1.3.3 that every permutation of a set has a unique representation  up to order  as a product of disjoint cycles, where the “product” of permutations is defined by a law of composition. It is easy to see that the product of disjoint cycles is exactly the same as their intercalation; this suggests that we might be able to generalize the previous results, obtaining a unique representation  in some sense  for any permutation of a multiset, as the intercalation of cycles. In fact there are at least two natural ways to do this, each of which has important applications.  Equation  5  shows one way to factor c a b d d a b d a d as the intercala- tion of shorter permutations; let us consider the general problem of finding all factorizations π = α β of a given permutation π. It will be helpful to consider a particular permutation, such as   a a b b b b b c c c d d d d d    ,   12   π =  d b c b c a c d a d d b b b d  as we investigate the factorization problem.  If we can write this permutation π in the form α β, where α contains the letter a at least once, then the leftmost a in the top line of the two-line notation for α must appear over the letter d, so α must also contain at least one occurrence of the letter d. If we now look at the leftmost d in the top line of α, we see in the same way that it must appear over the letter d, so α must contain at least two d’s. Looking at the second d, we see that α also contains at least one b. We have deduced the partial result    α =  . . .  b  . . .  d d  d  b  . . .   13    a  d   26  SORTING  5.1.2  on the sole assumption that α is a left factor of π containing the letter a. Proceeding in the same manner, we find that the b in the top line of  13  must appear over the letter c, etc. Eventually this process will reach the letter a again, and we can identify this a with the first a if we choose to do so. The argument we have just made essentially proves that any left factor α of  12  that contains the letter a has the form  d d b c d b b c a  α′, for some permutation α′.  It is convenient to write the a last in the cycle, instead of first; this arrangement is permissible since there is only one a.  Similarly, if we had assumed that α contains the letter b, we would have deduced that α =  c d d b  α′′ for some α′′. In general, this argument shows that, if we have any factorization α β = π,   x1 . . . xn y ,  where α contains a given letter y, exactly one cycle of the form x1, . . . , xn ̸= y,   14  is a left factor of α. This cycle is easily determined when π and y are given; it is the shortest left factor of π that contains the letter y. One of the consequences of this observation is the following theorem: Theorem A. Let the elements of the multiset M be linearly ordered by the relation “<”. Every permutation π of M has a unique representation as the intercalation  n ≥ 0,  π =  x11 . . . x1n1y1    x21 . . . x2n2y2   ···   xt1 . . . xtntyt ,  t ≥ 0,   15   where the following two conditions are satisfied:  and  yi < xij  y1 ≤ y2 ≤ ··· ≤ yt  for 1 ≤ j ≤ ni, 1 ≤ i ≤ t.   16   In other words, the last element in each cycle is smaller than every other element, and the sequence of last elements is in nondecreasing order.  If π = ϵ, we obtain such a factorization by letting t = 0. Otherwise Proof. we let y1 be the smallest element permuted; and we determine  x11 . . . x1n1 y1 , the shortest left factor of π containing y1, as in the example above. Now π =  x11 . . . x1n1 y1  ρ for some permutation ρ; by induction on the length, we can write  ρ =  x21 . . . x2n2 y2   ···   xt1 . . . xtnt yt ,  t ≥ 1,  where  16  is satisfied. This proves the existence of such a factorization.  Conversely, to prove that the representation  15  satisfying  16  is unique, clearly t = 0 if and only if π is the null permutation ϵ. When t > 0,  16  implies that y1 is the smallest element permuted, and that  x11 . . . x1n1 y1  is the shortest left factor containing y1. Therefore  x11 . . . x1n1 y1  is uniquely determined; by the cancellation law  7  and induction, the representation is unique.  For example, the “canonical” factorization of  12 , satisfying the given con-   d d b c d b b c a    b a    c d b    d ,   17   ditions, is  if a < b < c < d.   5.1.2  PERMUTATIONS OF A MULTISET  27  It is important to note that we can actually drop the parentheses and the ’s in this representation, without ambiguity! Each cycle ends just after the first appearance of the smallest remaining element. So this construction associates the permutation  π′ = d d b c d b b c a b a c d b d  with the original permutation  π = d b c b c a c d a d d b b b d.  x, where Whenever the two-line representation of π had a column of the form y x < y, the associated permutation π′ has a corresponding pair of adjacent elements . . . y x . . . . Thus our example permutation π has three columns of the form d b , and π′ has three occurrences of the pair d b. In general this construction establishes the following remarkable theorem: Theorem B. Let M be a multiset. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the permutations of M such that, if π corresponds to π′, the following conditions hold: a  The leftmost element of π′ equals the leftmost element of π. b  For all pairs of permuted elements  x, y  with x < y, the number of occur- rences of the column y x in the two-line notation of π is equal to the number of times x is immediately preceded by y in π′.  When M is a set, this is essentially the same as the “unusual correspondence” we discussed near the end of Section 1.3.3, with unimportant changes. The more general result in Theorem B is quite useful for enumerating special kinds of permutations, since we can often solve a problem based on a two-line constraint more easily than the equivalent problem based on an adjacent-pair constraint. P. A. MacMahon considered problems of this type in his extraordinary book Combinatory Analysis 1  Cambridge Univ. Press, 1915 , 168–186. He gave a constructive proof of Theorem B in the special case that M contains only two different kinds of elements, say a and b; his construction for this case is essentially the same as that given here, although he expressed it quite differently. For the case of three different elements a, b, c, MacMahon gave a complicated nonconstructive proof of Theorem B; the general case was first proved constructively by Foata [Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci. 258  Paris, 1964 , 1672–1675].  As a nontrivial example of Theorem B, let us find the number of strings of  letters a, b, c containing exactly  A occurrences of the letter a; B occurrences of the letter b; C occurrences of the letter c; occurrences of the adjacent pair of letters ca; k occurrences of the adjacent pair of letters cb; l m occurrences of the adjacent pair of letters ba.   18    5.1.2   19    20   28  SORTING  The theorem tells us that this is the same as the number of two-line arrays of the form  A        . . . . . .  a ␣ ␣ A−k−m a’s     b ␣  B     . . . . . .  m a’s    B−l b’s    a     b ␣      c ␣      . . . . . .

Is there such a thing as a “prime” permutation, one that has no intercalation factors except itself and ϵ? The discussion preceding Theorem A leads us quickly to conclude that a permutation is prime if and only if it is a cycle with no repeated elements. For if it is such a cycle, our argument proves that there are no left factors except ϵ and the cycle itself. And if a permutation contains a repeated element y, it has a nontrivial cyclic left factor in which y appears only once.  A nonprime permutation can be factored into smaller and smaller pieces until it has been expressed as a product of primes. Furthermore we can show that the factorization is unique, if we neglect the order of factors that commute: Theorem C. Every permutation of a multiset can be written as a product  ··· σt,  t ≥ 0,  σ1 σ2   21  where each σj is a cycle having no repeated elements. This representation is unique, in the sense that any two such representations of the same permuta- tion may be transformed into each other by successively interchanging pairs of adjacent disjoint cycles.   5.1.2  PERMUTATIONS OF A MULTISET  29  The term “disjoint cycles” means cycles having no elements in common. As  an example of this theorem, we can verify that the permutation   a a b b c c d    b a a c d b c  has exactly five factorizations into primes, namely   a b    a    c d    b c  =  a b  =  a b  =  c d  =  c d    c d   c d   a b   a b    a   b c   b c   a    b c   a   a   b c .   22  Proof. We must show that the stated uniqueness property holds. By induction on the length of the permutation, it suffices to prove that if ρ and σ are unequal cycles having no repeated elements, and if  then ρ and σ are disjoint, and  ρ α = σ β,  α = σ θ,  β = ρ θ,  for some permutation θ.  If y is any element of the cycle ρ, then any left factor of σ β containing the element y must have ρ as a left factor. So if ρ and σ have an element in common, σ is a multiple of ρ; hence σ = ρ  since they are primes , contradicting our as- sumption. Therefore the cycle containing y, having no elements in common with σ, must be a left factor of β. The proof is completed by using the cancellation law  7 .  As an example of Theorem C, let us consider permutations of the multiset M = {A · a, B · b, C · c} consisting of A a’s, B b’s, and C c’s. Let N A, B, C, m  be the number of permutations of M whose two-line representation contains no columns of the forms a b . It follows a, b b, c c , B − m of the form c that there are exactly A − m columns of the form a b, C − B + m of the form c a, C − A + m of the form b c, and A + B − C − m of the form b  c, and exactly m columns of the form a  a. Hence   A    m  B  C − A + m   C    B − m  .  N A, B, C, m  =   23   Theorem C tells us that we can count these permutations in another way: c are excluded, the only possible prime factors  a, b  b, c  Since columns of the form a of the permutation are   a b ,   a c ,   24  Each pair of these cycles has at least one letter in common, so the factorization into primes is completely unique. If the cycle  a b c  occurs k times in the factorization, our previous assumptions imply that  a b  occurs m − k times,   a b c ,   a c b .   b c ,   SORTING  30 5.1.2  b c  occurs C − A + m − k times,  a c  occurs C − B + m − k times, and  a c b  occurs A + B − C − 2m + k times. Hence N A, B, C, m  is the number of permutations of these cycles  a multinomial coefficient , summed over k:   m− k !  C − A+ m− k !  C − B + m− k ! k!

Similarly we can count the number of permutations of {A·a, B·b, C·c, D·d}  B− q B− A+ r D− r A− q D− A+ q  such that the number of columns of various types is specified as follows: Column type: Frequency:  Here A + C = B + D.  The possible cycles occurring in a prime factorization of such permutations are then Cycle:  d a  Frequency: A− r− s B− q− s D− r− s A− q− s for some s  see exercise 12 . In this case the cycles  a b  and  c d  commute with each other, and so do  b c  and  d a , so we must count the number of distinct prime factorizations. It turns out  see exercise 10  that there is always a unique factorization such that no  c d  is immediately followed by  a b , and no  d a  is immediately followed by  b c . Hence by the result of exercise 13, we have   d c b a  q− A+ r + s   a b c d    c d    a b    b c    29    28   d c  s   B   A− q− s   B + D− r− s− t    A− r− s− t ×  B− q− s   D− r− s !

But at least we have learned how to count certain kinds of permutations, in two different ways, and these counting techniques are good training for the problems that lie ahead.  EXERCISES 1.

In the latter case, the number of ways to represent the permutation in cycle form is the length of the oriented cycle.

Runs In Chapter 3 we analyzed the lengths of upward runs in permutations, as a way to test the randomness of a sequence. If we place a vertical line at both ends of a permutation a1 a2 . . . an and also between aj and aj+1 whenever aj > aj+1, the runs are the segments between pairs of lines. For example, the permutation   3 5 7  1 6 8 9  4  2    n    has four runs. The theory developed in Section 3.3.2G determines the average number of runs of length k in a random permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}, as well as the covariance of the numbers of runs of lengths j and k. Runs are important in the study of sorting algorithms, because they represent sorted segments of the data, so we will now take up the subject of runs once again.  Let us use the notation  k   1  to stand for the number of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} that have exactly k  “descents” aj > aj+1, thus exactly k + 1 ascending runs. These numbers n  arise in several contexts, and they are usually called Eulerian numbers since Euler discussed them in his famous book Institutiones Calculi Differentialis  St. Petersburg: 1755 , 485–487, after having introduced them several years earlier in a technical paper [Comment. Acad. Sci. Imp. Petrop. 8  1736 , 147– 158, §13]; they should not be confused with the Euler numbers En discussed in  exercise 5.1.4–23. The angle brackets in n definition of a descent. Of course n   remind us of the “>” sign in the  is also the number of permutations that    k  k  have k “ascents” aj < aj+1.  k   36  SORTING  5.1.3 We can use any given permutation of {1, . . . , n−1} to form n new permuta- tions, by inserting the element n in all possible places. If the original permutation has k descents, exactly k +1 of these new permutations will have k descents; the remaining n − 1 − k will have k + 1, since we increase the number of descents unless we place the element n at the end of an existing run. For example, the six permutations formed from 3 1 2 4 5 are  6 3 1 2 4 5, 3 1 2 6 4 5,  3 6 1 2 4 5, 3 1 2 4 6 5,  3 1 6 2 4 5, 3 1 2 4 5 6;  all but the second and last of these have two descents instead of one. Therefore we have the recurrence relation  =  k + 1   +  n − k   ,  integer n > 0, integer k.   2    n − 1    k   n    k  By convention we set     n − 1   k − 1   0   3  saying that the null permutation has no descents. The reader may find it interesting to compare  2  with the recurrence relations for Stirling numbers in Eqs. 1.2.6– 46 . Table 1 lists the Eulerian numbers for small n.  = δk0 ,  k  Several patterns can be observed in Table 1. By definition, we have   n    n  + ··· +  = n! ;    n  n   n  1  0    0   n    +     n  n  = 1 ;     =  n  n − 1 − k  ,  k  for n ≥ 1,  for n ≥ 1. Eq.  6  follows from  5  because of a general rule of symmetry,  n − 1  = 0 ,  = 1 ,  n  which comes from the fact that each nonnull permutation a1 a2 . . . an having k descents has n − 1 − k ascents.  Another important property of the Eulerian numbers is the formula   n   m + k      k  k  n  = mn ,  n ≥ 0,  which was discovered by the Chinese mathematician Li Shan-Lan and pub- lished in 1867.

Martzloff, A History of Chinese Mathematics  Berlin: Springer, 1997 , 346–348; special cases for n ≤ 5 had already been known to Yoshisuke Matsunaga in Japan, who died in 1744.] Li Shan-Lan’s identity follows from the properties of sorting: Consider the mn sequences a1 a2 . . . an such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ m. We can sort any such sequence into nondecreasing order in a stable manner, obtaining  ai1 ≤ ai2 ≤ ··· ≤ ain   4    5    6    7    8    9    5.1.3  RUNS  37   n     n     n    EULERIAN NUMBERS  Table 1   n     n     n    n    n    n    n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 0 0 1 4 11 26 57 120 247 502  2 0 0 0 1 11 66 302 1191 4293 14608  3 0 0 0 0 1 26 302 2416 15619 88234  6  5  4  7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 57 0 1191 15619 1 156190 88234 14608 502  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 120 4293  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 247  8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  where i1 i2 . . . in is a uniquely determined permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that aij = aij+1 implies ij   ij+1 implies that aij < aij+1.

This will prove  8  if we replace   permutations have n − k runs.  For example, if n = 9 and i1 i2 . . . in = 3 5 7 1 6 8 9 4 2, we want to count the  n  k  number of sequences a1 a2 . . . an such that  1 ≤ a3 ≤ a5 ≤ a7 < a1 ≤ a6 ≤ a8 ≤ a9 < a4 < a2 ≤ m;   10   this is the number of sequences b1 b2 . . . b9 such that  1 ≤ b1 < b2 < b3 < b4 < b5 < b6 < b7 < b8 < b9 ≤ m + 5,  9     n   x  and for any permutation i1 i2 . . . in with k runs.  ; a similar proof works for general n and k,  since we can let b1 = a3, b2 = a5 + 1, b3 = a7 + 2, b4 = a1 + 2, b5 = a6 + 3, etc. The number of choices of the b’s is simply the number of ways of choosing  9 things out of m + 5, namelym+5  x + 1    x  Since both sides of  8  are polynomials in m, we may replace m by any real number x, and we obtain an interesting representation of powers in terms of consecutive binomial coefficients:   x + n − 1   x + 2  = 1, since the binomial Setting x = 1 in  11  proves again that  n  This is the key property of Eulerian numbers that makes them useful in the study of discrete mathematics.   n   x + 1  For example,  , n ≥ 1.   n  + ··· +  n − 1  xn =  x3 =     11   + 4  +  +  3  0  1  3  3  n  n  n  .  coefficients vanish in all but the last term.

If we set  gn z  =  k   n   zk  k − 1  n! ,  the coefficient of zk is the probability that a random permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} has exactly k runs. Since k runs are just as likely as n+1−k, the average number of runs must be 1 2 n+1 . Exercise 2 b  shows that there is a simple formula for all the derivatives of gn z  at the point z = 1:  2 n+1 , hence g′n 1  = 1   n + 1   n    n ≥ m.  ,  m  g m  n  1  =  n + 1 − m   15  Thus in particular the variance g′′n 1  + g′n 1  − g′n 1 2 comes to  n + 1  12, for  n ≥ 2, indicating a rather stable distribution about the mean. We found this same quantity in Eq. 3.3.2– 18 , where it was called covar R′1, R′1 . Since gn z   gn z  = 1 n!  is a polynomial, we can use formula  15  to deduce the Taylor series expansions  zk+1 1− z n−kk!   n + 1   n + 1   z − 1 n−kk!  = 1 n!  n  n  k + 1  k + 1    .  k=0  k=0   n + 1    k + 1  The second of these equations follows from the first, since n ≥ 1,  gn z  = zn+1gn 1 z ,  by the symmetry condition  7 .

Schützenberger, Lecture Notes in Math. 138  Berlin: Springer, 1970 .  Let us now consider the length of runs; how long will a run be, on the average? We have already studied the expected number of runs having a given length, in Section 3.3.2; the average run length is approximately 2, in agreement with the fact that about 1 2 n + 1  runs appear in a random permutation of length n. For applications to sorting algorithms, a slightly different viewpoint is useful; we will consider the length of the kth run of the permutation from left to right, for k = 1, 2, . . . . For example, how long is the first  leftmost  run of a random permutation a1 a2 . . . an? Its length is always ≥ 1, and its length is ≥ 2 exactly one-half Its length is ≥ 3 exactly one-sixth of the the time  namely when a1 < a2 . time  when a1 < a2 < a3 , and, in general, its length is ≥ m with probability qm = 1 m!, for 1 ≤ m ≤ n. The probability that its length is exactly equal to m is therefore  pm = qm − qm+1 = 1 m! − 1  m + 1 !, pn = 1 n!.  for 1 ≤ m < n;   21   The average length of the first run therefore equals p1 + 2p2 +··· + npn =  q1 − q2  + 2 q2 − q3  +··· +  n− 1  qn−1 − qn  + nqn  22  If we let n → ∞, the limit is e − 1 = 1.71828 . . . , and for finite n the value is e − 1 − δn where δn is quite small; n + 2 +  = q1 + q2 +··· + qn = 1  1 + 1  2! +··· + 1 n! .    n + 2  n + 3  + ···  ≤ e − 1  n + 1 ! .  1! + 1   n + 1 !  δn =  1  1  For practical purposes it is therefore convenient to study runs in a random infinite sequence of distinct numbers  a1, a2, a3, . . . ;  by “random” we mean in this case that each of the n! possible relative orderings of the first n elements in the sequence is equally likely. The average length of the first run in a random infinite sequence is exactly e − 1.  By slightly sharpening our analysis of the first run, we can ascertain the average length of the kth run in a random sequence. Let qkm be the probability   SORTING  40 5.1.3 that the first k runs have total length ≥ m; then qkm is 1 m! times the number of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , m} that have ≤ k runs,   m     m    qkm =   23  The probability that the first k runs have total length m is qkm − qk m+1 . Therefore if Lk denotes the average length of the kth run, we find that  k − 1  m! .  0  + ··· +  L1 + ··· + Lk = average total length of first k runs  =  qk1 − qk2  + 2 qk2 − qk3  + 3 qk3 − qk4  + ··· = qk1 + qk2 + qk3 + ··· .       2  Subtracting L1 +··· + Lk−1 and using the value of qkm in  23  yields the desired  1 formula Lk = 1  24  Since 0  = 0 except when k = 1, Lk turns out to be the coefficient of zk−1 in 1!  m≥1 the generating function g z, 1  − 1  see Eq.  19  , so we have  + ··· =    m   3   1  + 1 3!  + 1 2!  k − 1  k − 1  k − 1  k − 1  m! .    k−1  − z.   25   From Euler’s formula  13  we obtain a representation of Lk as a polynomial in e:  k≥0  L z  = Lkzk = z 1 − z  ez−1 − z  jm  −1 k−j m + 1 k  m  jm  −1 k−j  k−1 m! +  k−1  m≥0  −1 k−jjk−j  k − j  k − j  m!  j=0  jn n! +  j=0   k − j ! n≥0  −1 k−jjk−j−1   k − j !  ej.  m≥0  Lk =  k k k  j=0  j=0  =  =  = k  j=0   −1 k−j   j=0 m≥0  −1 k−jjk−j−1  k − j − 1 !   jm  m!  k − j − 1   m   jn n!  n≥0   26   This formula for Lk was first obtained by B. J. Gassner [see CACM 10  1967 , 89–93]. In particular, we have  L1 = e − 1 L2 = e2 − 2e L3 = e3 − 3e2 + 3  ≈ 1.71828 . . . ; ≈ 1.95249 . . . ; 2 e ≈ 1.99579 . . . .  The second run is expected to be longer than the first, and the third run will be longer yet, on the average. This may seem surprising at first glance, but a moment’s reflection shows that the first element of the second run tends to be   5.1.3  RUNS  41  Table 2  AVERAGE LENGTH OF THE kTH RUN Lk  Lk  k 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  1.71828 18284 59045+ 1.95249 24420 12560− 1.99579 13690 84285− 2.00003 88504 76806− 2.00005 75785 89716+ 2.00000 50727 55710− 1.99999 96401 44022+ 1.99999 98889 04744+ 1.99999 99948 43434−  k 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  2.00000 00012 05997+ 2.00000 00001 93672+ 1.99999 99999 99909+ 1.99999 99999 97022− 1.99999 99999 99719+ 2.00000 00000 00019+ 2.00000 00000 00006+ 2.00000 00000 00000+ 2.00000 00000 00000−  small  it caused the first run to terminate ; hence there is a better chance for the second run to go on longer. The first element of the third run will tend to be even smaller than that of the second.  The numbers Lk are important in the theory of replacement-selection sorting  Section 5.4.1 , so it is interesting to study their values in detail. Table 2 shows the first 18 values of Lk to 15 decimal places. Our discussion in the preceding paragraph might lead us to suspect at first that Lk+1 > Lk, but in fact the values oscillate back and forth. Notice that Lk rapidly approaches the limiting value 2; it is quite remarkable to see these monic polynomials in the transcendental number e converging to the rational number 2 so quickly! The polynomials  26  are also somewhat interesting from the standpoint of numerical analysis, since they provide an excellent example of the loss of significant figures when nearly equal numbers are subtracted; using 19-digit floating point arithmetic, Gassner concluded incorrectly that L12 > 2, and John W. Wrench, Jr., has remarked that 42-digit floating point arithmetic gives L28 correct to only 29 significant digits. The asymptotic behavior of Lk can be determined by using simple principles of complex variable theory. The denominator of  25  is zero only when ez−1 = z, namely when  ex−1 cos y = x   27  if we write z = x + iy. Figure 3 shows the superimposed graphs of these two equations, and we note that they intersect at the points z = z0, z1, z1, z2, z2, . . . , where z0 = 1,  ex−1 sin y = y,  and  z1 =  3.08884 30156 13044−  +  7.46148 92856 54255−  i,   28  and the imaginary part ℑ zk+1  is roughly equal to ℑ zk +2π for large k. Since   1 − z    for k > 0,  lim z→zk  ez−1 − z   z − zk  = −1, and since the limit is −2 for k = 0, the function Rm z  = L z + 2z z− z0  z− z1  z− z2  z− z1  + z  + z  + z  + z  z− z2  +···+ z  z− zm  + z  z− zm   SORTING  power series expansion  42 5.1.3 has no singularities in the complex plane for z < zm+1. Hence Rm z  has a k ρkzk that converges absolutely when z < zm+1; it follows that ρkM k → 0 as k → ∞, where M = zm+1 − ϵ. The coefficients of L z  are the coefficients of  2z 1 − z  + z z1 1 − z z1  + z z1 1 − z z1  + ··· + z zm 1 − z zm  + z zm 1 − z zm  + Rm z ,  namely,  if we let   29    30   Ln = 2 + 2r−n 1  cos nθ1 + 2r−n 2  cos nθ2 + ··· + 2r−n  m cos nθm + O r−n  m+1 ,  zk = rkeiθk .  This shows the asymptotic behavior of Ln. We have  r1 = 8.07556 64528 89526−, r2 = 14.35456 68997 62106−, r3 = 20.62073 15381 80628−, r4 = 26.88795 29424 54546−,  θ1 = 1.17830 39784 74668+; θ2 = 1.31268 53883 87636+; θ3 = 1.37427 90757 91688−; θ4 = 1.41049 72786 51865−;  2   31  so the main contribution to Ln − 2 is due to r1 and θ1, and convergence of  29  is quite rapid. Further analysis [W. W. Hooker, CACM 12  1969 , 411– 413] shows that Rm z  → cz for some constant c as m → ∞; hence the series cos nθk actually converges to Ln when n > 1.  See also exercise 28.  k≥0 r−n A more careful examination of probabilities can be carried out to determine the complete probability distribution for the length of the kth run and for the total length of the first k runs  see exercises 9, 10, 11 . The sum L1 + ··· + Lk turns out to be asymptotically 2k − 1  k  3 + O 8−k .  Let us conclude this section by considering the properties of runs when equal elements are allowed to appear in the permutations. The famous nineteenth- century American astronomer Simon Newcomb amused himself by playing a game of solitaire related to this question. He would deal a deck of cards into a pile, so long as the face values were in nondecreasing order; but whenever the next card to be dealt had a face value lower than its predecessor, he would start a new pile. He wanted to know the probability that a given number of piles would be formed after the entire deck had been dealt out in this manner.  Simon Newcomb’s problem therefore consists of finding the probability dis- tribution of runs in a random permutation of a multiset. The general answer is rather complicated  see exercise 12 , although we have already seen how to solve the special case when all cards have a distinct face value. We will content ourselves here with a derivation of the average number of piles that appear in the game.  Suppose first that there are m different types of cards, each occurring exactly p times. An ordinary bridge deck, for example, has m = 13 and p = 4 if suits are disregarded. A remarkable symmetry applying to this case was discovered   5.1.3  RUNS  43  Fig. 3. Roots of ez−1 = z.  by P. A. MacMahon [Combinatory Analysis 1  Cambridge, 1915 , 212–213]: The number of permutations with k + 1 runs is the same as the number with mp − p − k + 1 runs. When p = 1, this relation is Eq.  7 , but for p > 1 it is quite surprising.  We can prove the symmetry by setting up a one-to-one correspondence between the permutations in such a way that each permutation with k + 1 runs corresponds to another having mp − p − k + 1 runs. The reader is urged to try discovering such a correspondence before reading further.  No very simple correspondence is evident; MacMahon’s proof was based on generating functions instead of a combinatorial construction. But Foata’s correspondence  Theorem 5.1.2B  provides a useful simplification, because it tells us that there is a one-to-one correspondence between multiset permutations with k + 1 runs and permutations whose two-line notation contains exactly k columns y Suppose the given multiset is {p · 1, p · 2, . . . , p · m}, and consider the  x with x < y.  permutation whose two-line notation is  1 . . . . . . x1p  2 x21  2 . . . . . . x2p  . . . . . .  m . . . m xm1 . . . xmp  We can associate this permutation with another one,  1 . . . . . . x′1p  2 x′m1  2 . . . . . . x′mp  . . . m . . . m . . . x′2p . . .  x′21  where x′ = m + 1− x. If  32  contains k columns of the form y x with x < y, then  33  contains  m−1 p−k such columns; for we need only consider the case y > 1, and x < y is equivalent to x′ ≥ m+2−y. Now  32  corresponds to a permutation     .  ,   32    33    1  1  x11  x′11  ex−1 sin y = y ex−1 cos y = x  10  5  0  −5  −10  z2  z1  z0  z1  z2  0  5  10   SORTING  44 5.1.3 with k +1 runs, and  33  corresponds to a permutation with mp− p− k +1 runs, and the transformation that takes  32  into  33  is reversible — it takes  33  back into  32 . Therefore MacMahon’s symmetry condition has been established. See exercise 14 for an example of this construction.   k + 1  +  mp − p − k + 1  = 1 + 1  Because of the symmetry property, the average number of runs in a random 2 p m − 1 . For permutation must be 1 2 example, the average number of piles resulting from Simon Newcomb’s solitaire game using a standard deck will be 25  so it doesn’t appear to be a very exciting way to play solitaire . We can actually determine the average number of runs in general, using a fairly simple argument, given any multiset {n1 · x1, n2 · x2, . . . , nm · xm} where the x’s are distinct. Let n = n1 + n2 + ··· + nm, and imagine that all of the permutations a1 a2 . . . an of this multiset have been written down; we will count how often ai is greater than ai+1, for each fixed value of i, 1 ≤ i < n. The number of times ai > ai+1 is just half of the number of times ai ̸= ai+1; and it is not difficult to see that ai = ai+1 = xj exactly N nj nj − 1  n n − 1  times, where N is the total number of permutations. Hence ai = ai+1 exactly 1 + ··· + n2  m − n   N  N  n n − 1  n2  n n − 1   n1 n1 − 1  + ··· + nm nm − 1  = n2 −  n2  2n n − 1   times, and ai > ai+1 exactly N  1 + ··· + n2  times. Summing over i and adding N, since a run ends at an in each permutation, we obtain the total number of runs among all N permutations:   n2  1 + ··· + n2  m  + 1   34   m    .   n 2 − 1 2n  N  Dividing by N gives the desired average number of runs.  Since runs are important in the study of “order statistics,” there is a fairly large literature dealing with them, including several other types of runs not considered here.

[HM42]  Walter Weissblum.  The “long runs” of a permutation a1 a2 . . . an are obtained by placing vertical lines just before a segment fails to be monotonic; long runs are either increasing or decreasing, depending on the order of their first two elements, so the length of each long run  except possibly the last  is ≥ 2.

Tableaux and Involutions To complete our survey of the combinatorial properties of permutations, we will discuss some remarkable relations that connect permutations with arrays of integers called tableaux. A Young tableau of shape  n1, n2, . . . , nm , where n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ··· ≥ nm > 0, is an arrangement of n1 + n2 + ··· + nm distinct integers in an array of left-justified rows, with ni elements in row i, such that the entries of each row are in increasing order from left to right, and the entries of each column are increasing from top to bottom. For example,  1 2 5 9 10 15 3 6 7 13 4 8 12 14 11   1    48  SORTING  5.1.4  is a Young tableau of shape  6, 4, 4, 1 . Such arrangements were introduced by Alfred Young as an aid to the study of matrix representations of permutations [see Proc. London Math. Soc.  2  28  1928 , 255–292; Bruce E. Sagan, The Symmetric Group  Pacific Grove, Calif.: Wadsworth & Brooks Cole, 1991 ]. For simplicity, we will simply say “tableau” instead of “Young tableau.” are ten involutions of {1, 2, 3, 4}:  An involution is a permutation that is its own inverse. For example, there  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4   1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  2 1 3 4   1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  3 2 1 4   1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  4 2 3 1   1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  1 3 2 4      2   1 4 3 2  1 2 4 3  2 1 4 3  3 4 1 2  4 3 2 1  The term “involution” originated in classical geometry problems; involutions in the general sense considered here were first studied by H. A. Rothe when he introduced the concept of inverses  see Section 5.1.1 .  It may appear strange that we should be discussing both tableaux and involutions at the same time, but there is an extraordinary connection be- tween these two apparently unrelated concepts: The number of involutions of {1, 2, . . . , n} is the same as the number of tableaux that can be formed from the elements {1, 2, . . . , n}. For example, exactly ten tableaux can be formed from {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely, 1 2 3 4  1 3 4 2  1 2 3 4  1 4 2 3  1 3 2 4  1 3 2 4  1 2 3 4  1 2 3 4  1 2 4 3  1 2 3 4  corresponding respectively to the ten involutions  2 .  This connection between involutions and tableaux is by no means obvious, and there is probably no very simple way to prove it. The proof we will discuss involves an interesting tableau-construction algorithm that has several other surprising properties. It is based on a special procedure that inserts new elements into a tableau.  For example, suppose that we want to insert the element 8 into the tableau   3    4   1 3 5 9 12 16 2 6 10 15 4 13 14 11 17  .   5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  49  The method we will use starts by placing the 8 into row 1, in the spot previously occupied by 9, since 9 is the least element greater than 8 in that row. Element 9 is “bumped down” into row 2, where it displaces the 10. The 10 then “bumps” the 13 from row 3 to row 4; and since row 4 contains no element greater than 13, the process terminates by inserting 13 at the right end of row 4. Thus, tableau  4  has been transformed into  1 3 5 8 12 16 2 6 9 15 4 10 14 11 13 17  .   5   A precise description of this process, together with a proof that it always  preserves the tableau properties, appears in Algorithm I. Algorithm I  Insertion into a tableau . Let P =  Pij  be a tableau of positive integers, and let x be a positive integer not in P. This algorithm transforms P into another tableau that contains x in addition to its original elements. The new tableau has the same shape as the old, except for the addition of a new position in row s, column t, where s and t are quantities determined by the algorithm.  Parenthesized remarks in this algorithm serve to prove its validity, since it is easy to verify inductively that the remarks are valid and that the array P remains a tableau throughout the process. For convenience we will assume that the tableau has been bordered by zeros at the top and left and with ∞’s to the right and below, so that Pij is defined for all i, j ≥ 0. If we define the relation  6   a < b or a = b = 0  or a = b = ∞,  if and only if  a <∼ b   7   the tableau inequalities can be expressed in the convenient form j = 0;  i = 0  Pij = 0 Pij <∼ Pi j+1   if and only if and Pij <∼ P i+1 j,  or for all i, j ≥ 0.  P1j = ∞.  The statement “x ̸∈ P” means that either x = ∞ or x ̸= Pij for all i, j ≥ 0.  I1. [Input x.] Set i ← 1, set x1 ← x, and set j to the smallest value such that I2. [Find xi+1.]  At this point P i−1 j < xi < Pij and xi ̸∈ P.  If xi < Pi j−1 , decrease j by 1 and repeat this step. Otherwise set xi+1 ← Pij and set ri ← j. I3. [Replace by xi.]  Now Pi j−1  < xi < xi+1 = Pij <∼ Pi j+1 , P i−1 j < xi < xi+1 = Pij <∼ P i+1 j, and ri = j.  Set Pij ← xi. I4. [Is xi+1 = ∞?]  Now Pi j−1  < Pij = xi < xi+1 <∼ Pi j+1 , P i−1 j < Pij = xi < xi+1 <∼ P i+1 j, ri = j, and xi+1  ∈ P.  If xi+1 ̸= ∞, increase i by 1 and return to step I2.   SORTING  50 5.1.4 I5. [Determine s, t.] Set s ← i, t ← j, and terminate the algorithm.  At this  point the conditions  Pst ̸= ∞ and P s+1 t = Ps t+1  = ∞  are satisfied.  Algorithm I defines a “bumping sequence”  x = x1 < x2 < ··· < xs < xs+1 = ∞,   8    9   as well as an auxiliary sequence of column indices r1 ≥ r2 ≥ ··· ≥ rs = t;   10  element Piri has been changed from xi+1 to xi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. For example, when we inserted 8 into  4 , the bumping sequence was 8, 9, 10, 13, ∞, and the auxiliary sequence was 4, 3, 2, 2. We could have reformulated the algorithm so that it used much less temporary storage; only the current values of j, xi, and xi+1 need to be remembered. But sequences  9  and  10  have been introduced so that we can prove interesting things about the algorithm.  The key fact we will use about Algorithm I is that it can be run backwards: Given the values of s and t determined in step I5, we can transform P back into its original form again, determining and removing the element x that was inserted. For example, consider  5  and suppose we are told that element 13 is in the position that used to be blank. Then 13 must have been bumped down from row 3 by the 10, since 10 is the greatest element less than 13 in that row; similarly the 10 must have been bumped from row 2 by the 9, and the 9 must have been bumped from row 1 by the 8. Thus we can go from  5  back to  4 . The following algorithm specifies this process in detail: Algorithm D  Deletion from a tableau . Given a tableau P and positive integers s, t satisfying  8 , this algorithm transforms P into another tableau, having almost the same shape, but with ∞ in column t of row s. An element x, determined by the algorithm, is deleted from P.   As in Algorithm I, parenthesized assertions are included here to facilitate  a proof that P remains a tableau throughout the process.  D1. [Input s, t.] Set j ← t, i ← s, xs+1 ← ∞. D2. [Find xi.]  At this point Pij < xi+1 <∼ P i+1 j and xi+1 ̸∈ P.  If Pi j+1  < xi+1, increase j by 1 and repeat this step. Otherwise set xi ← Pij and ri ← j. D3. [Replace by xi+1.]  Now Pi j−1  < Pij = xi < xi+1 <∼ Pi j+1 , P i−1 j < Pij = xi < xi+1 <∼ P i+1 j, and ri = j.  Set Pij ← xi+1. D4. [Is i = 1?]  Now Pi j−1  < xi < xi+1 = Pij <∼ Pi j+1 , P i−1 j < xi < xi+1 = Pij   1, decrease i by 1 and return to step D2.  D5. [Determine x.] Set x ← x1; the algorithm terminates.  Now 0 < x < ∞.    5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  51  The parenthesized assertions appearing in Algorithms I and D are not only a useful way to prove that the algorithms preserve the tableau structure; they also serve to verify that Algorithms I and D are perfect inverses of each other. If we perform Algorithm I first, given some tableau P and some positive integer x ̸∈ P, it will insert x and determine positive integers s, t satisfying  8 ; Algorithm D applied to the result will recompute x and will restore P. Conversely, if we perform Algorithm D first, given some tableau P and some positive integers s, t satisfying  8 , it will modify P, deleting some positive integer x; Algorithm I applied to the result will recompute s, t and will restore P. The reason is that the parenthesized assertions of steps I3 and D4 are identical, as are the assertions of steps I4 and D3, and these assertions characterize the value of j uniquely. Hence the auxiliary sequences  9 ,  10  are the same in each case.  Now we are ready to prove a basic property of tableaux:  Theorem A. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} and the set of ordered pairs  P, Q  of tableaux formed from {1, 2, . . . , n}, where P and Q have the same shape.   An example of this theorem appears within the proof that follows.   Proof. It is convenient to prove a slightly more general result. Given any two-line array  q2 p2  . . . qn . . . pn  q1 < q2 < ··· < qn, p1, p2, . . . , pn distinct,   11    q1  p1    ,  we will construct two corresponding tableaux P and Q, where the elements of P are {p1, . . . , pn} and the elements of Q are {q1, . . . , qn} and the shape of P is the shape of Q. Let P and Q be empty initially. Then, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n  in this order , do the following operation: Insert pi into tableau P using Algorithm I; then set Qst ← qi, where s and t specify the newly filled position of P.  For example, if the given permutation is 1 3 5 6 8  , we obtain  7 2 9 5 3  Insert 7:  Insert 2:  Insert 9:  Insert 5:  Insert 3:  P 7  2 7  2 9 7  2 5 7 9  2 3 5 9 7  Q 1  1 3  1 5 3  1 5 3 6  1 5 3 6 8   12    52  SORTING  so the tableaux  P, Q  corresponding to 1 3 5 6 8   are  7 2 9 5 3  P =  ,  Q =  2 3 5 9 7  1 5 3 6 8  .  It is clear from this construction that P and Q always have the same shape; furthermore, since we always add elements on the periphery of Q, in increasing order, Q is a tableau.  Conversely, given two equal-shape tableaux P and Q, we can find the cor-  responding two-line array  11  as follows. Let the elements of Q be  q1 < q2 < ··· < qn.  For i = n, . . . , 2, 1  in this order , let pi be the element x that is removed when Algorithm D is applied to P, using the values s and t such that Qst = qi.  the calculation  12  until P is empty, and 1 3 5 6 8  For example, this construction will start with  13  and will successively undo   is obtained.  Since Algorithms I and D are inverses of each other, the two constructions we have described are inverses of each other, and the one-to-one correspondence has been established.  7 2 9 5 3  The correspondence defined in the proof of Theorem A has many startling properties, and we will now proceed to derive some of them. The reader is urged to work out the example in exercise 1, in order to become familiar with the construction, before proceeding further.  Once an element has been bumped from row 1 to row 2, it doesn’t affect row 1 any longer; furthermore rows 2, 3, . . . are built up from the sequence of bumped elements in exactly the same way as rows 1, 2, . . . are built up from the original permutation. These facts suggest that we can look at the construction of Theorem A in another way, concentrating only on the first rows of P and Q.  For example, the permutation  1 3 5 6 8   causes the following action in row 1,  according to  12 :  7 2 9 5 3 Insert 7, set Q11 ← 1. Insert 2, bump 7. Insert 9, set Q12 ← 5. Insert 5, bump 9. Insert 3, bump 5.  1: 3: 5: 6: 8:     3 6 8  7 9 5  .  Thus the first row of P is 2 3, and the first row of Q is 1 5. Furthermore, the remaining rows of P and Q are the tableaux corresponding to the “bumped” two-line array  In order to study the behavior of the construction on row 1, we can consider the elements that go into a given column of this row. Let us say that  qi, pi  is  5.1.4   13    14    15    5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  53  in class t with respect to the two-line array   q1  p1    ,  q2 p2  . . . qn . . . pn  q1 < q2 < ··· < qn, p1, p2, . . . , pn distinct,  if pi = P1t after Algorithm I has been applied successively to p1, p2, . . . , pi, starting with an empty tableau P.  Remember that Algorithm I always inserts the given element into row 1.  It is easy to see that  qi, pi  is in class 1 if and only if pi has i− 1 inversions, that is, if and only if pi = min{p1, p2, . . . , pi} is a “left-to-right minimum.” If we cross out the columns of class 1 in  16 , we obtain another two-line array   q′1  p′1    q′2 p′2  q′m . . . . . . p′m   16    17   such that  q, p  is in class t with respect to  17  if and only if it is in class t+1 with respect to  16 . The operation of going from  16  to  17  represents removing the leftmost position of row 1. This gives us a systematic way to determine the  classes. For example in 1 3 5 6 8 7 and 2, so class 1 is { 1, 7 ,  3, 2 }; in the remaining array 5 6 8   the elements that are left-to-right minima are  all elements  are minima, so class 2 is { 5, 9 ,  6, 5 ,  8, 3 }. In the “bumped” array  15 , class 1 is { 3, 7 ,  8, 5 } and class 2 is { 6, 9 }.  7 2 9 5 3  9 5 3  For any fixed value of t, the elements of class t can be labeled   qi1 , pi1 , . . . ,  qik , pik  qi1 < qi2 < ··· < qik , pi1 > pi2 > ··· > pik ,  in such a way that   18  since the tableau position P1t takes on the decreasing sequence of values pi1 , . . . , pik as the insertion algorithm proceeds. At the end of the construction we have  19  and the “bumped” two-line array that defines rows 2, 3, . . . of P and Q contains the columns  Q1t = qi1;  P1t = pik ,   qi2  pi1  qi3 pi2  . . . qik . . . pik−1   20   plus other columns formed in a similar way from the other classes.  These observations lead to a simple method for calculating P and Q by hand  see exercise 3 , and they also provide us with the means to prove a rather unexpected result:  Theorem B. If the permutation 1  2 a1 a2  . . . n . . . an      corresponds to tableaux  P, Q  in the construction of Theorem A, then the inverse permutation corresponds to  Q, P .   54  SORTING  5.1.4  This fact is quite startling, since P and Q are formed by such completely different methods in Theorem A, and since the inverse of a permutation is obtained by juggling the columns of the two-line array rather capriciously. Proof. Suppose that we have a two-line array  16 ; its columns are essentially independent and can be rearranged. Interchanging the lines and sorting the columns so that the new top line is in increasing order gives the “inverse” array   q1  p1  q2 p2  . . . qn . . . pn  − =  =   p1  p′1  q1  q′1     ,  p2 q2 p′2 q′2  . . . pn . . . qn . . . p′n q′n . . .  p′1 < p′2 < ··· < p′n; q′1, q′2, . . . , q′n distinct.   21   We will show that this operation corresponds to interchanging P and Q in the construction of Theorem A.  Exercise 2 reformulates our remarks about class determination so that the class of  qi, pi  doesn’t depend on the fact that q1, q2, . . . , qn are in ascending order. Since the resulting condition is symmetrical in the q’s and the p’s, the operation  21  does not destroy the class structure; if  q, p  is in class t with respect to  16 , then  p, q  is in class t with respect to  21 . If we therefore arrange the elements of the latter class t as  by analogy with  18 , we have  as in  19 , and the columns pik−1  pik < ··· < pi2 < pi1, qik > ··· > qi2 > qi1,  P1t = qi1 ,  Q1t = pik    . . . pi2 . . . qi3  pi1 qi2  qik   22    23    24   go into the “bumped” array as in  20 . Hence the first rows of P and Q are interchanged. Furthermore the “bumped” two-line array for  21  is the inverse of the “bumped” two-line array for  16 , so the proof is completed by induction on the number of rows in the tableaux. Corollary B. The number of tableaux that can be formed from {1, 2, . . . , n} is the number of involutions on {1, 2, . . . , n}. If π is an involution corresponding to  P, Q , then π = π− corresponds Proof. to  Q, P ; hence P = Q. Conversely, if π is any permutation corresponding to  P, P , then π− also corresponds to  P, P ; hence π = π−. So there is a one-to-one correspondence between involutions π and tableaux P.  It is clear that the upper-left corner element of a tableau is always the smallest. This suggests a possible way to sort a set of numbers: First we can put the numbers into a tableau, by using Algorithm I repeatedly; this brings the smallest element to the corner. Then we delete the smallest element, rearranging   5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  55  the remaining elements so that they form another tableau; then we delete the new smallest element; and so on.  Let us therefore consider what happens when we delete the corner element  from the tableau  1 3 5 7 11 15 2 6 8 14 4 9 13 10 12 16  .   25   If the 1 is removed, the 2 must come to take its place. Then we can move the 4 up to where the 2 was, but we can’t move the 10 to the position of the 4; the 9 can be moved instead, then the 12 in place of the 9. In general, we are led to the following procedure. Algorithm S  Delete corner element . Given a tableau P, this algorithm deletes the upper left corner element of P and moves other elements so that the tableau properties are preserved. The notational conventions of Algorithms I and D are used. S1. [Initialize.] Set r ← 1, s ← 1. S2. [Done?] If Prs = ∞, the process is complete. S3. [Compare.] If P r+1 s <∼ Pr s+1 , go to step S5.  We examine the elements just below and to the right of the vacant cell, and we will move the smaller of the two.   S4. [Shift left.] Set Prs ← Pr s+1 , s ← s + 1, and return to S3. S5. [Shift up.] Set Prs ← P r+1 s, r ← r + 1, and return to S2.  It is easy to prove that P is still a tableau after Algorithm S has deleted its corner element  see exercise 10 . So if we repeat Algorithm S until P is empty, we can read out its elements in increasing order. Unfortunately this doesn’t turn out to be as efficient a sorting algorithm as other methods we will see; its minimum running time is proportional to n1.5, but similar algorithms that use trees instead of tableau structures have an execution time on the order of n log n. In spite of the fact that Algorithm S doesn’t lead to a superbly efficient  sorting algorithm, it has some very interesting properties. Theorem C  M. P. Schützenberger . struction of Theorem A from the permutation a1 a2 . . . an, and if  If P is the tableau formed by the con-  ai = min{a1, a2, . . . , an},  then Algorithm S changes P to the tableau corresponding to a1. . . ai−1 ai+1. . . an. Proof. See exercise 13.   56  SORTING  5.1.4  After we apply Algorithm S to a tableau, let us put the deleted element into the newly vacated place Prs, but in italic type to indicate that it isn’t really part of the tableau. For example, after applying this procedure to the tableau  25  we would have  2 3 5 7 11 15 4 6 8 14 9 12 13 10 1 16 and two more applications yield  4 5 7 11 15 2 6 8 13 14 9 12 3 10 1 16  Continuing until all elements are removed gives 16 14 13 12 10 2 15 9 6 4 11 5 3 8 1 7   26   which has the same shape as the original tableau  25 . This configuration may be called a dual tableau, since it is like a tableau except that the “dual order” has been used  reversing the roles of   . Let us denote the dual tableau formed from P in this way by the symbol P S.  From P S we can determine P uniquely; in fact, we can obtain the original tableau P from P S, by applying exactly the same algorithm — but reversing the order and the roles of italic and regular type, since P S is a dual tableau. For example, two steps of the algorithm applied to  26  give  ,  .  ,  ,  14 13 12 10 2 15 11 9 6 4 8 5 3 7 1 16  and eventually  25  will be reproduced again! This remarkable fact is one of the consequences of our next theorem.  Schensted, M. P. Schützenberger  + .    27    28   5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  57  Theorem D  C. Schensted, M. P. Schützenberger . Let  be the two-line array corresponding to the tableaux  P, Q . a  Using dual  reverse  order on the q’s, but not on the p’s, the two-line array      q2 p2  . . . qn . . . pn  . . . q2 . . . p2  q1 p1  p1   q1  qn corresponds toP T ,  QS T. corresponds to P S T , QT.  pn  sponds to  P S, QS .

No simple proof of this theorem is known. The fact that case  a  corresponds to  P T , X  for some dual tableau X is proved in exercise 5; hence by Theorem B, case  b  corresponds to  Y, QT   for some dual tableau Y, and Y must have the shape of P T. Let pi = min{p1, . . . , pn}; since pi is the “largest” element in the dual order, it appears on the periphery of Y, and it doesn’t bump any elements in the con- struction of Theorem A. Thus, if we successively insert p1, . . . , pi−1, pi+1, . . . , pn using the dual order, we get Y −{pi}, that is, Y with pi removed. By Theorem C if we successively insert p1, . . . , pi−1, pi+1, . . . , pn using the normal order, we get the tableau d P  obtained by applying Algorithm S to P. By induction on n,  Y − {pi} =d P ST. But since   29  by definition of the operation S, and since Y has the same shape as  P S T, we must have Y =  P S T.  This proves part  b , and part  a  follows by an application of Theorem B. Applying parts  a  and  b  successively then shows that case  c  corresponds  to   P T  S T,   QS T  T; and this is  P S, QS  since  P S T =  P T  S by the   P S T − {pi} =d P ST ,  row-column symmetry of operation S.  In particular, this theorem establishes two surprising facts about the tableau insertion algorithm: If successive insertion of distinct elements p1, . . . , pn into an empty tableau yields tableau P, insertion in the opposite order pn, . . . , p1 yields the transposed tableau P T. And if we not only insert the p’s in this order pn, . . . , p1 but also interchange the roles of  , as well as 0 and ∞, in the insertion process, we obtain the dual tableau P S. The reader is urged to try out these processes on some simple examples. The unusual nature of these coincidences might lead us to suspect that some sort of witchcraft is operating   58  SORTING  5.1.4  behind the scenes! No simple explanation for these phenomena is yet known; there seems to be no obvious way to prove even that case  c  corresponds to tableaux having the same shape as P and Q, although the characterization of classes in exercise 2 does provide a significant clue. The correspondence of Theorem A was given by G. de B. Robinson [Amer- ican J. Math. 60  1938 , 745–760, §5], in a somewhat vague and different form, as part of his solution to a rather difficult problem in group theory. Robinson stated Theorem B without proof. Many years later, C. Schensted independently rediscovered the correspondence, which he described in terms of “bumping” as we have done in Algorithm I; Schensted also proved the “P ” part of Theorem D a  [see Canadian J. Math. 13  1961 , 179–191]. M. P. Schützenberger [Math. Scand. 12  1963 , 117–128] proved Theorem C and the “Q” part of Theorem D a , from which  b  and  c  follow. It is possible to extend the correspondence to permutations of multisets; the case that p1, . . . , pn need not be distinct was considered by Schensted, and the “ultimate” generalization to the case that both the p’s and the q’s may contain repeated elements was investigated by Knuth [Pacific J. Math. 34  1970 , 709–727].  Let us now turn to a related question: How many tableaux formed from {1, 2, . . . , n} have a given shape  n1, n2, . . . , nm , where n1 + n2 +··· + nm = n? If we denote this number by f n1, n2, . . . , nm , and if we allow the parameters nj to be arbitrary integers, the function f must satisfy the relations n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ··· ≥ nm ≥ 0;  f n1, n2, . . . , nm  = 0  unless  f n1, n2, . . . , nm, 0  = f n1, n2, . . . , nm ;  f n1, n2, . . . , nm  = f n1−1, n2, . . . , nm  + f n1, n2−1, . . . , nm   + ··· + f n1, n2, . . . , nm−1 ,  if n1 ≥ n2 ≥ ··· ≥ nm ≥ 1.   32  Recurrence  32  comes from the fact that a tableau with its largest element removed is always another tableau; for example, the number of tableaux of shape  6, 4, 4, 1  is f 5, 4, 4, 1  + f 6, 3, 4, 1  + f 6, 4, 3, 1  + f 6, 4, 4, 0  = f 5, 4, 4, 1  + f 6, 4, 3, 1  + f 6, 4, 4 , since every tableau of shape  6, 4, 4, 1  on {1, 2, . . . , 15} is formed by inserting the element 15 into the appropriate place in a tableau of shape  5, 4, 4, 1 ,  6, 4, 3, 1 , or  6, 4, 4 . Schematically:  =  15  +  15  +  15  The function f n1, n2, . . . , nm  that satisfies these relations has a fairly  simple form,  f n1, n2, . . . , nm  = ∆ n1 + m − 1, n2 + m − 2, . . . , nm  n!  n1 + m − 1 !  n2 + m − 2 ! . . . nm!  ,   30   31    33    34    5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  59  provided that the relatively mild conditions  are satisfied; here ∆ denotes the “square root of the discriminant” function  n1 + m − 1 ≥ n2 + m − 2 ≥ ··· ≥ nm    xm−1 1 ... x2 1 x1 1  xm−1 2 ... x2 2 x2 1  m  . . . xm−1 ... x2 m xm 1  . . .   =   1≤i<j≤m  ∆ x1, x2, . . . , xm  = det   xi − xj .   35   Formula  34  was derived by G. Frobenius [Sitzungsberichte preuß. Akad. der Wissenschaften  1900 , 516–534, §3], in connection with an equivalent problem in group theory, using a rather deep group-theoretical argument; a combinatorial proof was given independently by MacMahon [Philosophical Trans. A209  1909 , 153–175]. The formula can be established by induction, since relations  30  and  31  are readily proved and  32  follows by setting y = −1 in the identity of exercise 17.  Theorem A gives a remarkable identity in connection with this formula for  the number of tableaux. If we sum over all shapes, we have  k1≥k2≥···≥kn≥0 k1+k2+···+kn=n  n! =  = n!2    k1≥k2≥···≥kn≥0 k1+k2+···+kn=n  = n!2  f k1, k2 . . . , kn 2  ∆ k1 + n − 1, k2 + n − 2, . . . , kn 2  k1 + n − 1 !2  k2 + n − 2 !2 . . . kn!2  ∆ q1, q2, . . . , qn 2 q1!2 q2!2 . . . qn!2 ;  hence  q1>q2>···>qn≥0  q1+q2+···+qn= n+1 n 2    q1+q2+···+qn= n+1 n 2  q1,q2,...,qn≥0  ∆ q1, q2, . . . , qn 2 q1!2 q2!2 . . . qn!2 = 1.   36   The inequalities q1 > q2 > ··· > qn have been removed in the latter sum, since the summand is a symmetric function of the q’s that vanishes when qi = qj. A similar identity appears in exercise 24.  The formula for the number of tableaux can also be expressed in a much more interesting way, based on the idea of “hooks.” The hook corresponding to a cell in a tableau is defined to be the cell itself plus the cells lying below and to its right. For example, the shaded area in Fig. 5 is the hook corresponding to cell  2, 3  in row 2, column 3; it contains six cells. Each cell of Fig. 5 has been filled in with the length of its hook.   60  SORTING  5.1.4  12 11 8 7 5 4 1   10 9 6 5 3 2   9 8 5 4 2 1 6 5 2 1 3 2 2 1          Fig. 5. Hooks and hook lengths.  If the shape of the tableau is  n1, n2, . . . , nm , the longest hook has length n1+m−1. Further examination of the hook lengths shows that row 1 con- tains all the lengths n1+m−1, n1+m−2, . . . , 1 except for  n1+m−1 − nm ,  n1+m−1 − nm−1+1 , . . . ,  n1+m−1 − n2+m−2 . In Fig. 5, for example, the hook lengths in row 1 are 12, 11, 10, . . . , 1 except for 10, 9, 6, 3, 2; the exceptions correspond to five nonexistent hooks, from nonexistent cells  6, 3 ,  5, 3 ,  4, 5 ,  3, 7 ,  2, 7  leading up to cell  1, 7 . Similarly, row j contains all lengths nj +m−j, . . . , 1, except for  nj +m−j − nm , . . . ,  nj +m−j −  nj+1+m−j−1 . It follows that the product of all the hook lengths is equal to   n1+m−1 !  n2+m−2 ! . . . nm! ∆ n1+m−1, n2+m−2, . . . , nm  .  This is just what happens in Eq.  34 , so we have derived the following celebrated result due to J. S. Frame, G. de B. Robinson, and R. M. Thrall [Canadian J. Math. 6  1954 , 316–318]: Theorem H. The number of tableaux on {1, 2, . . . , n} having a specified shape is n! divided by the product of the hook lengths.  Since this is such a simple rule,  it deserves a simple proof; a heuristic argument runs as follows: Each element of the tableau is the smallest in its hook. If we fill the tableau shape at random, the probability that cell  i, j  will contain the minimum element of the corresponding hook is the reciprocal of the hook length; multiplying these probabilities over all i and j gives Theorem H. But unfortunately this argument is fallacious, since the probabilities are far from independent! No direct proof of Theorem H, based on combinatorial properties of hooks used correctly, was known until 1992  see exercise 39 , although researchers did discover several instructive indirect proofs  exercises 35, 36, and 38 .  Theorem H has an interesting connection with the enumeration of trees, which we considered in Chapter 2. We observed that binary trees with n nodes correspond to permutations that can be obtained with a stack, and that such permutations correspond to sequences a1 a2 . . . a2n of n S’s and n X’s, where the number of S’s is never less than the number of X’s as we read from left to right.  See exercises 2.2.1–3 and 2.3.1–6.  The latter sequences correspond in a natural way to tableaux of shape  n, n ; we place in row 1 the indices i such that ai = S, and in row 2 we put those indices with ai = X. For example, the sequence  S S S X X S S X X S X X   5.1.4  corresponds to the tableau  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  61   37   The column constraint is satisfied in this tableau if and only if the number of X’s never exceeds the number of S’s from left to right. By Theorem H, the number of tableaux of shape  n, n  is  1 2 3 6 7 10 4 5 8 9 11 12  .   2n !   n + 1 ! n! ;  so this is the number of binary trees, in agreement with Eq. 2.3.4.4– 14 . Further- more, this argument solves the more general “ballot problem” considered in the answer to exercise 2.2.1–4, if we use tableaux of shape  n, m  for n ≥ m. So Theorem H includes some rather complex enumeration problems as simple special cases. Any tableau A of shape  n, n  on the elements {1, 2, . . . , 2n} corresponds to two tableaux  P, Q  of the same shape, in the following way suggested by MacMahon [Combinatory Analysis 1  1915 , 130–131]: Let P consist of the ele- ments {1, . . . , n} as they appear in A; then Q is formed by taking the remaining elements, rotating the configuration by 180◦, and replacing n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n by n, n − 1, . . . , 1, respectively. For example,  37  splits into  1 2 3 6 4 5  and  7 10 8 9 11 12  ;  rotation and renaming of the latter yields  P = 1 2 3 6  , Q = 1 2 4 5  .  4 5  3 6   38   Conversely, any pair of equal-shape tableaux of at most two rows, each containing n cells, corresponds in this way to a tableau of shape  n, n . Hence by exercise 7 the number of permutations a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n} containing no decreasing subsequence ai > aj > ak for i < j < k is the number of binary trees with n nodes. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between such permutations and binary trees, more direct than the roundabout method via Algorithm I that we have used here, has been found by D. Rotem [Inf. Proc. Letters 4  1975 , 58–61]; similarly there is a rather direct correspondence between binary trees and permutations having no instances of ai > ak > aj for i < j < k  see exercise 2.2.1–5 . The number of ways to fill a tableau of shape  6, 4, 4, 1  is obviously the number of ways to put the labels {1, 2, . . . , 15} onto the vertices of the directed graph   39    62  SORTING  5.1.4  in such a way that the label of vertex u is less than the label of vertex v whenever u → v. In other words, it is the number of ways to sort the partial ordering  39  topologically, in the sense of Section 2.2.3.  In general, we can ask the same question for any directed graph that contains no oriented cycles. It would be nice if there were some simple formula generalizing Theorem H to the case of an arbitrary directed graph; but not all graphs have such pleasant properties as the graphs corresponding to tableaux. Some other classes of directed graphs for which the labeling problem has a simple solution are discussed in the exercises at the close of this section. Other exercises show that some directed graphs have no simple formula corresponding to Theorem H. For example, the number of ways to do the labeling is not always a divisor of n!. To complete our investigations, let us count the total number of tableaux that can be formed from n distinct elements; we will denote this number by tn. By Corollary B, tn is the number of involutions of {1, 2, . . . , n}. A permutation is its own inverse if and only if its cycle form consists solely of one-cycles  fixed points  and two-cycles  transpositions . Since tn−1 of the tn involutions have  n  as a one-cycle, and since tn−2 of them have  j n  as a two-cycle, for fixed j < n, we obtain the formula   40  which Rothe devised in 1800 to tabulate tn for small n. The values for n ≥ 0 are 1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, . . . . Counting another way, let us suppose that there are k two-cycles and  n−2k   tn = tn−1 +  n − 1 tn−2,  ways to choose the fixed points, and the multinomial  one-cycles. There are n  coefficient  2k !  2! k is the number of ways to arrange the other elements into k distinguishable transpositions; dividing by k! to make the transpositions indistinguishable we therefore obtain  2k  tn =  tn k ,  tn k  =  n!   n − 2k ! 2kk! .   41   k=0  Unfortunately, this sum has no simple closed form  unless we choose to regard the Hermite polynomial in2−n 2Hn approaches in order to understand tn better:  2 as simple , so we resort to two indirect  −i  a  We can find the generating function  √  tnzn n! = ez+z2 2;   42   ⌊n 2⌋  see exercise 25.  n  b  We can determine the asymptotic behavior of tn. This is an instructive problem, because it involves some general techniques that will be useful to us in other connections, so we will conclude this section with an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of tn.   5.1.4  TABLEAUX AND INVOLUTIONS  63  The first step in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of  41  is to locate the  main contribution to the sum. Since  2 k + 1   tn k + 1   tn k  =  n − 2k  n − 2k − 1  n−√   43  we can see that the terms gradually increase from k = 0 until tn k + 1  ≈ tn k  when k is approximately 1 2 1 2 n. The main contribution clearly comes from the vicinity of k = 1 n  . It is usually preferable to have the main contribution at the value 0, so we write  44   n; then they decrease to zero when k exceeds 2 n − √ 2 n − √  n   + x,  k = 1  ,  and we will investigate the size of tn k  as a function of x.  One useful way to get rid of the factorials in tn k  is to use Stirling’s approximation, Eq. 1.2.11.2– 18 . For this purpose it is convenient  as we shall see in a moment  to restrict x to the range  −nϵ+1 4 ≤ x ≤ nϵ+1 4,   45  where ϵ = 0.001, say, so that an error term can be included. A somewhat laborious calculation, which the author did by hand in the 60s but which is now easily done with the help of computer algebra, yields the formula 2 ln π  tn k  = exp 1  2 n ln n − 1  2 n +  √  − 4   46  The restriction on x in  45  can be justified by the fact that we may set x = ±nϵ+1 4 to get an upper bound for all of the discarded terms, namely  3 x3 n + 2x   n − 1 √  √ 4 ln n − 2x2  √ n − 4 n + 1 3    n − 1 4 − 1 √ 3 x4 n  n + O n5ϵ−3 4 . 2 ln π + O n3ϵ−1 4 ,  n − 1  2 n ln n − 1  4 ln n − 1  4 − 1  2 n +   47  and if we multiply this by n we get an upper bound for the sum of the excluded terms. The upper bound is of lesser order than the terms we will compute for x in the restricted range  45 , because of the factor exp −2n2ϵ , which is much smaller than any polynomial in n. √  We can evidently remove the factor n − 1  2 ln π + 1 3   from the sum, and this leaves us with the task of summing  exp 1   48   √  e−2n2ϵ exp 1  √  exp−2x2   √  n − 4  2 n +  2 n ln n − 1  1 − 4 3  −2x2√  3 x3 n + 2x   √  n  = exp  4 ln n − 1 4 − 1 n + O n5ϵ−3 4    √  n   x6 n2 1 − 4 3  1 + 2 x√ n  + 2 x2  n  1 + O n9ϵ−3 4   x4 √ n n   49   n − 4 3 x4 n + 8 x3  9 n  ×   α  α  α≤x<β  + 1  f x  =  SORTING    2 f x    β  64 5.1.4 over the range x = α, α+1, . . . , β−2, β−1, where −α and β are approximately equal to nϵ+1 4  and not necessarily integers .

In principle, the method we have used could be extended to obtain O n−k  for any k, instead of O n−3 4 . This asymptotic series for tn was first determined  using a different method  by Moser and Wyman, Canadian J. Math. 7  1955 , 159–168.  The method we have used to derive  53  is an extremely useful technique for asymptotic analysis that was introduced by P. S. Laplace [Mémoires Acad. Sci.  Paris, 1782 , 1–88]; it is discussed under the name “trading tails” in CMath, §9.4. For further examples and extensions of tail-trading, see the conclusion of Section 5.2.2.  EXERCISES 1.

The permutation a1 . . . aj−2 aj aj−1 aj+1 . . . an, obtained by inter- changing aj−1 with aj, is called “admissible” if either i  j ≥ 3 and aj−2 lies between aj−1 and aj; or ii  j < n and aj+1 lies between aj−1 and aj. For example, exactly three admissible interchanges can be performed on the permuta- tion 1 5 4 6 8 3 7; we can interchange the 1 and the 5 since 1 < 4 < 5; we can interchange the 8 and the 3 since 3 < 6 < 8  or since 3 < 7 < 8 ; but we cannot interchange the 5 and the 4, or the 3 and the 7. a  Prove that an admissible interchange does not change the tableau P formed from the permutation by successive insertion of the elements a1, a2, . . . , an into an initially empty tableau.  b  Conversely, prove that any two permutations that have the same P tableau can be transformed into each other by a sequence of one or more admissible interchanges.

The following procedure, which is analogous to the “siftup” algorithm in Section 5.2.3, can be used to convert P to a tableau. It also defines an array Q of the same shape, which can be used to provide a combinatorial proof of Theorem H.  P1.

INTERNAL SORTING Let’s begin our discussion of good “sortsmanship” by conducting a little ex- periment. How would you solve the following programming problem?  “Memory locations R+1, R+2, R+3, R+4, and R+5 contain five numbers. Write a computer program that rearranges these numbers, if necessary, so that they are in ascending order.”   If you already are familiar with some sorting methods, please do your best to forget about them momentarily; imagine that you are attacking this problem for the first time, without any prior knowledge of how to proceed.   Before reading any further, you are requested to construct a solution to this  problem. .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . The time you spent working on the challenge problem will pay dividends as you continue to read this chapter. Chances are your solution is one of the following types:  A. An insertion sort. The items are considered one at a time, and each new item is inserted into the appropriate position relative to the previously-sorted items.  This is the way many bridge players sort their hands, picking up one card at a time.   B. An exchange sort. If two items are found to be out of order, they are  interchanged. This process is repeated until no more exchanges are necessary.  C. A selection sort. First the smallest  or perhaps the largest  item is lo- cated, and it is somehow separated from the rest; then the next smallest  or next largest  is selected, and so on.  D. An enumeration sort. Each item is compared with each of the others; an  item’s final position is determined by the number of keys that it exceeds.  E. A special-purpose sort, which works nicely for sorting five elements as stated in the problem, but does not readily generalize to larger numbers of items. F. A lazy attitude, with which you ignored the suggestion above and decided not to solve the problem at all. Sorry, by now you have read too far and you have lost your chance.  G. A new, super sorting technique that is a definite improvement over known  methods.  Please communicate this to the author at once.   If the problem had been posed for, say, 1000 items, not merely 5, you might also have discovered some of the more subtle techniques that will be mentioned later. At any rate, when attacking a new problem it is often wise to find some fairly obvious procedure that works, and then try to improve upon it. Cases A, B, and C above lead to important classes of sorting techniques that are refinements of the simple ideas stated.  Many different sorting algorithms have been invented, and we will be dis- cussing about 25 of them in this book. This rather alarming number of methods is actually only a fraction of the algorithms that have been devised so far; many techniques that are now obsolete will be omitted from our discussion, or   74  SORTING  5.2  mentioned only briefly. Why are there so many sorting methods? For computer programming, this is a special case of the question, “Why are there so many x methods?”, where x ranges over the set of problems; and the answer is that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, so that it outperforms the others on some configurations of data and hardware. Unfortunately, there is no known “best” way to sort; there are many best methods, depending on what is to be sorted on what machine for what purpose. In the words of Rudyard Kipling, “There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays, and every single one of them is right.”  It is a good idea to learn the characteristics of each sorting method, so that an intelligent choice can be made for particular applications. Fortunately, it is not a formidable task to learn these algorithms, since they are interrelated in interesting ways.  At the beginning of this chapter we defined the basic terminology and  notation to be used in our study of sorting: The records   1  are supposed to be sorted into nondecreasing order of their keys K1, K2, . . . , KN, essentially by discovering a permutation p 1  p 2  . . . p N  such that  R1, R2, . . . , RN  Kp 1  ≤ Kp 2  ≤ ··· ≤ Kp N .   2  In the present section we are concerned with internal sorting, when the number of records to be sorted is small enough that the entire process can be performed in a computer’s high-speed memory.  In some cases we will want the records to be physically rearranged in memory so that their keys are in order, while in other cases it may be sufficient merely to have an auxiliary table of some sort that specifies the permutation. If the records and or the keys each take up quite a few words of computer memory, it is often better to make up a new table of link addresses that point to the records, and to manipulate these link addresses instead of moving the bulky records around. This method is called address table sorting  see Fig. 6 . If the key is short but the satellite information of the records is long, the key may be placed with the link addresses for greater speed; this is called keysorting. Other sorting schemes utilize an auxiliary link field that is included in each record; these links are manipulated in such a way that, in the final result, the records are linked together to form a straight linear list, with each link pointing to the following record. This is called list sorting  see Fig. 7 .  After sorting with an address table or list method, the records can be re- arranged into increasing order as desired. Exercises 10 and 12 discuss interesting ways to do this, requiring only enough additional memory space to hold one record; alternatively, we can simply move the records into a new area capable of holding all records. The latter method is usually about twice as fast as the former, but it demands nearly twice as much storage space. Many applications can get by without moving the records at all, since the link fields are often adequate for all of the subsequent processing.   5.2  INTERNAL SORTING  75  Fig. 6. Address table sorting.  Fig. 7. List sorting.  All of the sorting methods that we shall examine in depth will be illustrated  in four ways, by means of a  an English-language description of the algorithm, b  a flow diagram, c  a MIX program, and d  an example of the sorting method applied to a certain set of 16 numbers. For convenience, the MIX programs will usually assume that the key is numeric and that it fits in a single word; sometimes we will even restrict the key to part of a word. The order relation < will be ordinary arithmetic order; and the record will consist of the key alone, with no satellite information. These assumptions make the programs shorter and easier to understand, and a reader should find it fairly easy to adapt any of the programs to the general case by using address table sorting or list sorting. An analysis of the running time of each sorting algorithm will be given with the MIX programs. Sorting by counting. As a simple example of the way in which we shall study internal sorting methods, let us consider the “counting” idea mentioned near the beginning of this section. This simple method is based on the idea that the jth key in the final sorted sequence is greater than exactly j−1 of the other keys. Putting this another way, if we know that a certain key exceeds exactly 27 others, and if no two keys are equal, the corresponding record should go into  R1  89  R  D  R2  37  S  T  Key cid:41   R3  41  O  E  Records  Satellite information  Auxiliary table  Before sorting  After sorting  R1  89  R  D  R2  37  S  T  Key cid:41   R3  41  O  E  Satellite information  Link ﬁeld  after sorting   Head of list   76  SORTING  5.2  algorithm.  The obvious way to do the comparisons is to  position 28 after sorting. So the idea is to compare every pair of keys, counting how many are less than each particular one.   compare Kj with Ki  for 1 ≤ j ≤ N for 1 ≤ i ≤ N;  compare Kj with Ki  for 1 ≤ j < i for 1 < i ≤ N.  but it is easy to see that more than half of these comparisons are redundant, since it is unnecessary to compare a key with itself, and it is unnecessary to compare Ka with Kb and later to compare Kb with Ka. We need merely to  Hence we are led to the following algorithm. Algorithm C  Comparison counting . This algorithm sorts R1, . . . , RN on the keys K1, . . . , KN by maintaining an auxiliary table COUNT[1], . . . , COUNT[N] to count the number of keys less than a given key. After the conclusion of the algorithm, COUNT[j] + 1 will specify the final position of record Rj. C1. [Clear COUNTs.] Set COUNT[1] through COUNT[N] to zero. C2. [Loop on i.] Perform step C3, for i = N, N−1, . . . , 2; then terminate the  C3. [Loop on j.] Perform step C4, for j = i−1, i−2, . . . , 1. C4. [Compare Ki : Kj.] If Ki < Kj, increase COUNT[j] by 1; otherwise increase  COUNT[i] by 1. Note that this algorithm involves no movement of records. It is similar to an address table sort, since the COUNT table specifies the final arrangement of records; but it is somewhat different because COUNT[j] tells us where to move Rj, instead of indicating which record should be moved into the place of Rj.  Thus the COUNT table specifies the inverse of the permutation p 1  . . . p N ; see Section 5.1.1.   Table 1 illustrates the typical behavior of comparison counting, by applying it to 16 numbers that were chosen at random by the author on March 19, 1963. The same 16 numbers will be used to illustrate almost all of the other methods that we shall discuss later.  In our discussion preceding this algorithm we blithely assumed that no two keys were equal. This was a potentially dangerous assumption, for if equal keys corresponded to equal COUNTs the final rearrangement of records would be quite complicated. Fortunately, however, Algorithm C gives the correct result no matter how many equal keys are present; see exercise 2. Program C  Comparison counting . The following MIX implementation of Algorithm C assumes that Rj is stored in location INPUT + j, and COUNT[j] in location COUNT + j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ N; rI1 ≡ i; rI2 ≡ j; rA ≡ Ki ≡ Ri; rX ≡ COUNT[i]. 01 START ENT1 N 02 03 04  C1.

For example, the data in Table 1 has N = 16, A = 120, B = 41, so Program C will sort it in 1129u. See exercise 5 for a modification of Program C that has slightly different timing characteristics.  The factor N 2 that dominates this running time shows that Algorithm C is not an efficient way to sort when N is large; doubling the number of records increases the running time fourfold. Since the method requires a comparison of all distinct pairs of keys  Ki, Kj , there is no apparent way to get rid of the dependence on N 2, although we will see later in this chapter that the worst-case running time for sorting can be reduced to order N log N using other techniques. Our main interest in Algorithm C is its simplicity, not its speed. Algorithm C serves as an example of the style in which we will be describing more complex  and more efficient  methods.  There is another way to sort by counting that is quite important from the standpoint of efficiency; it is primarily applicable in the case that many equal keys are present, and when all keys fall into the range u ≤ Kj ≤ v, where  v− u  is small. These assumptions appear to be quite restrictive, but in fact we shall see quite a few applications of the idea. For example, if we apply this method to the leading digits of keys instead of applying it to entire keys, the file will be partially sorted and it will be comparatively simple to complete the job.  In order to understand the principles involved, suppose that all keys lie between 1 and 100. In one pass through the file we can count how many 1s, 2s, . . . , 100s are present; and in a second pass we can move the records into the appropriate place in an output area. The following algorithm spells things out in complete detail: Algorithm D  Distribution counting . Assuming that all keys are integers in the range u ≤ Kj ≤ v for 1 ≤ j ≤ N, this algorithm sorts the records R1, . . . , RN by making use of an auxiliary table COUNT[u], . . . , COUNT[v].

Sorting by comparison counting as in Algorithm C was first mentioned in print by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 152], although he didn’t claim it as his own invention. Distribution sorting as in Algorithm D was first developed by H. Seward in 1954 for use with radix sorting techniques that we will discuss later  see Section 5.2.5 ; it was also published under the name “Mathsort” by W. Feurzeig, CACM 3  1960 , 601.  EXERCISES 1.

Thus the problem is to design an algorithm that rearranges R1, . . . , RN in place, based on the values of COUNT[u], . . . , COUNT[v] after step D4, without using additional memory space; this is essentially a generalization of the problem considered in exercise 10.   5.2.1. Sorting by Insertion One of the important families of sorting techniques is based on the “bridge player” method mentioned near the beginning of Section 5.2: Before examining record Rj, we assume that the preceding records R1, . . . , Rj−1 have already been sorted; then we insert Rj into its proper place among the previously sorted records. Several interesting variations on this basic theme are possible. Straight insertion. The simplest insertion sort is the most obvious one. Assume that 1 < j ≤ N and that records R1, . . . , Rj−1 have been rearranged so that  K1 ≤ K2 ≤ ··· ≤ Kj−1.   Remember that, throughout this chapter, Kj denotes the key portion of Rj.  We compare the new key Kj with Kj−1, Kj−2, . . . , in turn, until discovering that Rj should be inserted between records Ri and Ri+1; then we move records Ri+1, . . . , Rj−1 up one space and put the new record into position i + 1. It is convenient to combine the comparison and moving operations, interleaving them as shown in the following algorithm; since Rj “settles to its proper level” this method of sorting has often been called the sifting or sinking technique.

We have found the desired  position for record R.   S4. [Move Ri, decrease i.] Set Ri+1 ← Ri, then i ← i − 1. If i > 0, go back to step S3.  If i = 0, K is the smallest key found so far, so record R belongs in position 1.   S5. [R into Ri+1.] Set Ri+1 ← R. Table 1 shows how our sixteen example numbers are sorted by Algorithm S. This method is extremely easy to implement on a computer; in fact the following MIX program is the shortest decent sorting routine in this book.

Clearly A is the number of times Kj < min K1, . . . , Kj−1  for 1 < j ≤ N; this is one less than the number of left- to-right minima, so A is equivalent to the quantity that was analyzed carefully in Section 1.2.10. Some reflection shows us that B is also a familiar quantity: The number of moves for fixed j is the number of inversions of Kj, so B is the total number of inversions of the permutation K1 K2 . . . KN. Hence by Eqs. 1.2.10– 16 , 5.1.1– 12 , and 5.1.1– 13 , we have  A =min 0, ave HN − 1, max N − 1, dev B =min 0, ave  N 2 − N  4, max  N 2 − N  2, devN N − 1  N + 2.5  6;  HN − H    ;   2  N  and the average running time of Program S, assuming that the input keys are distinct and randomly ordered, is  2.25N 2 + 7.75N − 3HN − 6 u. Exercise 33 explains how to improve this slightly.  The example data in Table 1 involves 16 items; there are two changes to the left-to-right minimum, namely 087 and 061; and there are 41 inversions, as we have seen in the previous section. Hence N = 16, A = 2, B = 41, and the total sorting time is 514u. Binary insertion and two-way insertion. While the jth record is being processed during a straight insertion sort, we compare its key with about j 2 of the previously sorted keys, on the average; therefore the total number of comparisons performed comes to roughly  1 + 2 + ··· + N  2 ≈ N 2 4, and this gets very large when N is only moderately large. In Section 6.2.1 we shall study “binary search” techniques, which show where to insert the jth item after only about lg j well-chosen comparisons have been made. For example, when inserting the 64th record we can start by comparing K64 with K32; if it is less, we compare it with K16, but if it is greater we compare it with K48, etc., so that the proper place to insert R64 will be known after making only six comparisons. The total number of comparisons for inserting all N items comes to about N lg N, a substantial improvement over 1 4 N 2; and Section 6.2.1 shows that the corresponding program need not be much more complicated than a program for straight insertion. This method is called binary insertion; it was mentioned by John Mauchly as early as 1946, in the first published discussion of computer sorting.  The unfortunate difficulty with binary insertion is that it solves only half of the problem; after we have found where record Rj is to be inserted, we still need to move about 1 2 j of the previously sorted records in order to make room for Rj, so the total running time is still essentially proportional to N 2. Some early computers such as the IBM 705 had a built-in “tumble” instruction that did such move operations at high speed, and modern machines can do the moves even faster with special hardware attachments; but as N increases, the dependence on N 2 eventually takes over. For example, an analysis by H. Nagler [CACM 3   5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  83   1960 , 618–620] indicated that binary insertion could not be recommended for sorting more than about N = 128 records on the IBM 705, when each record was 80 characters long, and similar analyses apply to other machines.  Of course, a clever programmer can think of various ways to reduce the amount of moving that is necessary; the first such trick, proposed early in the 1950s, is illustrated in Table 2. Here the first item is placed in the center of an output area, and space is made for subsequent items by moving to the right or to the left, whichever is most convenient. This saves about half the running time of ordinary binary insertion, at the expense of a somewhat more complicated program. It is possible to use this method without using up more space than required for N records  see exercise 6 ; but we shall not dwell any longer on this “two-way” method of insertion, since considerably more interesting techniques have been developed.  Table 2  TWO-WAY INSERTION  ∧503 087 503 ∧ ∧087 503 512 061 087 503 512 ∧ 061 087 ∧503 512 908 061 087 170 503 512 ∧908 061 087 170 ∧503 512 897 908 061 087 170 275 503 512 897 908  Shell’s method. If we have a sorting algorithm that moves items only one position at a time, its average time will be, at best, proportional to N 2, since each record must travel an average of about 1 3 N positions during the sorting process  see exercise 7 . Therefore, if we want to make substantial improvements over straight insertion, we need some mechanism by which the records can take long leaps instead of short steps.  Such a method was proposed in 1959 by Donald L. Shell [CACM 2, 7  July 1959 , 30–32], and it became known as shellsort. Table 3 illustrates the general idea behind the method: First we divide the 16 records into 8 groups of two each, namely  R1, R9 ,  R2, R10 , . . . ,  R8, R16 . Sorting each group of records separately takes us to the second line of Table 3; this is called the “first pass.” Notice that 154 has changed places with 512; 908 and 897 have both jumped to the right. Now we divide the records into 4 groups of four each, namely  R1, R5, R9, R13 , . . . ,  R4, R8, R12, R16 , and again each group is sorted separately; this “second pass” takes us to line 3. A third pass sorts two groups of eight records, then a fourth pass completes the job by sorting all 16 records. Each of the intermediate sorting processes involves either a comparatively short file or a file that is comparatively well ordered, so straight insertion can be used   84  SORTING  5.2.1  Table 3  SHELLSORT WITH INCREMENTS 8, 4, 2, 1  503 087 512 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 154 509 612 677 765 703  8-sort:  4-sort:  2-sort:  1-sort:  503 087 154 061 612 170 765 275 653 426 512 509 908 677 897 703  503 087 154 061 612 170 512 275 653 426 765 509 908 677 897 703  154 061 503 087 512 170 612 275 653 426 765 509 897 677 908 703  061 087 154 170 275 426 503 509 512 612 653 677 703 765 897 908  algorithm.  for each sorting operation. In this way the records tend to converge quickly to their final destinations.  Shellsort is also known as the “diminishing increment sort,” since each pass is defined by an increment h such that we sort the records that are h units apart. The sequence of increments 8, 4, 2, 1 is not sacred; indeed, any sequence ht−1, ht−2, . . . , h0 can be used, so long as the last increment h0 equals 1. For example, Table 4 shows the same data sorted with increments 7, 5, 3, 1. Some sequences are much better than others; we will discuss the choice of increments later. Algorithm D  Shellsort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete, their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. An auxiliary sequence of increments ht−1, ht−2, . . . , h0 is used to control the sorting process, where h0 = 1; proper choice of these increments can significantly decrease the sorting time. This algorithm reduces to Algorithm S when t = 1. D1. [Loop on s.] Perform step D2 for s = t− 1, t− 2, . . . , 0; then terminate the  D2. [Loop on j.] Set h ← hs, and perform steps D3 through D6 for h < j ≤ N.  We will use a straight insertion method to sort elements that are h positions apart, so that Ki ≤ Ki+h for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − h. Steps D3 through D6 are essentially the same as steps S2 through S5, respectively, in Algorithm S.   D3. [Set up i, K, R.] Set i ← j − h, K ← Kj, R ← Rj. D4.

In order to choose a good sequence of increments ht−1, . . . , h0 for use in Algorithm D, we need to analyze the running time as a function of those increments. This leads to some fascinating mathematical problems, not yet completely resolved; nobody has been able to determine the best possible sequence of increments for large values of N. Yet a good many interesting facts are known about the behavior of shellsort, and we will summarize them here; details appear in the exercises below.

As in the analysis of Program S, A is essentially the number of left-to-right minima encountered in the intermediate sorting operations, and B is the number of inversions in the subfiles. The factor that governs the running time is B, so we shall devote most of our attention to it. For purposes of analysis we shall assume that the keys are distinct and initially in random order. Let us call the operation of step D2 “h-sorting,” so that shellsort consists of ht−1-sorting, followed by ht−2 sorting, . . . , followed by h0-sorting. A file in which Ki ≤ Ki+h for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − h will be called “h-ordered.” Consider first the simplest generalization of straight insertion, when there are just two increments, h1 = 2 and h0 = 1. In this case the second pass begins with a 2-ordered sequence of keys, K1 K2 . . . KN. It is easy to see that the number of permutations a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n} having ai ≤ ai+2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2 is   n    ⌊n 2⌋  ,  since we obtain exactly one 2-ordered permutation for each choice of ⌊n 2⌋ elements to put in the even-numbered positions a2 a4 . . . , while the remaining ⌈n 2⌉ elements occupy the odd-numbered positions. Each 2-ordered permutation is equally likely after a random file has been 2-sorted. What is the average number of inversions among all such permutations? Let An be the total number of inversions among all 2-ordered permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Clearly A1 = 0, A2 = 1, A3 = 2; and by considering the six cases  1 3 2 4  1 2 3 4  1 2 4 3  2 1 3 4  2 1 4 3  3 1 4 2  we find that A4 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8. One way to investigate An in general is to consider the “lattice diagram” illustrated in Fig. 11 for n = 15. A 2-ordered permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} can be represented as a path from the upper left corner point  0,0  to the lower right corner point  ⌈n 2⌉, ⌊n 2⌋ , if we make the kth step of the path go downwards or to the right, respectively, according as k appears in an odd or an even position in the permutation. This rule defines a one-to-one correspondence between 2-ordered permutations and n-step paths from corner to corner of the lattice diagram; for example, the path shown by the heavy line in Fig. 11 corresponds to the permutation  2 1 3 4 6 5 7 10 8 11 9 12 14 13 15.   1  Furthermore, we can attach “weights” to the vertical lines of the path, as Fig. 11 shows; a line from  i, j  to  i+1, j  gets weight i − j. A little study will convince the reader that the sum of these weights along each path is equal to the number of inversions of the corresponding permutation; this sum also equals the number   5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  87  Fig. 11. Correspondence between 2-ordering and paths in a lattice. Italicized numbers are weights that yield the number of inversions in the 2-ordered permutation.  of shaded squares between the given path and the staircase path indicated by heavy dots in the figure.

In this way we find that the standard deviation is also proportional to n3 2, so the distribution is not extremely stable about the mean. Now let us consider the general two-pass case of Algorithm D, when the  increments are h and 1: Theorem H. The average number of inversions in an h-ordered permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} is  f n, h  = 22q−1q! q!  2q + 1 !  q q + 1  +   q + 1  − 1 2  2  q  ,   4   where q = ⌊n h⌋ and r = n mod h. This theorem is due to Douglas H. Hunt [Bachelor’s thesis, Princeton University  April 1967 ]. Note that when h ≥ n the formula correctly gives f n, h  = 1 2 Proof. An h-ordered permutation contains r sorted subsequences of length q +1, and h− r of length q. Each inversion comes from a pair of distinct subsequences, and a given pair of distinct subsequences in a random h-ordered permutation defines a random 2-ordered permutation. The average number of inversions is therefore the sum of the average number of inversions between each pair of distinct subsequences, namely  n  .  2   h − r       + r h − r  A2q+1 2q + 1   +  q   h − r  2   A2q2q  q   = f n, h .   r  2   A2q+2 2q + 2  q + 1  Corollary H. condition  If the sequence of increments ht−1, . . . , h1, h0 satisfies the  5   for t − 1 > s ≥ 0,  hs+1 mod hs = 0,   5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  89  Fig. 12.

Proof. The process of hs-sorting consists of a straight insertion sort on rs  hs+1 hs -ordered subfiles of length qs + 1, and on  hs − rs  such subfiles of length qs. The divisibility condition implies that each of these subfiles is a ran- dom  hs+1 hs -ordered permutation, in the sense that each  hs+1 hs -ordered permutation is equally likely, since we are assuming that the original input was a random permutation of distinct elements.  Condition  5  in this corollary is always satisfied for two-pass shellsorts, when the increments are h and 1. If q = ⌊N h⌋ and r = N mod h, the quantity B in Program D will have an average value of rf q+1, N  +  h − r f q, N  + f N, h  = r 2  + h − r 2 √ π 8 n3 2h1 2; we can, To a first approximation, the function f n, h  equals   for example, compare it to the smooth curve in Fig. 12 when n = 64. Hence the running time for a two-pass Program D is approximately proportional to   q + 1  + f N, h .   q      2  2  The best choice of h is therefore approximately 316N π ≈ 1.72 3√  2N 2 h +  πN 3h.  this choice of h we get an average running time proportional to N 5 3.

Clearly we can do even better when more increments are used. Exercise 18 discusses the optimum choice of ht−1, . . . , h0 when t is fixed and when the h’s are constrained by the divisibility condition; the running time decreases to O N 1.5+ϵ 2 , where ϵ = 1  2t − 1 , for large N. We cannot break the N 1.5 barrier by using the formulas above, since the last pass always contributes 1 2 π 8 N 3 2h 1  √ f N, h1  ≈    inversions to the sum. But our intuition tells us that we can do even better when the increments ht−1, . . . , h0 do not satisfy the divisibility condition  5 . For example, 8-sorting followed by 4-sorting followed by 2-sorting does not allow any interaction between keys in even and odd positions; therefore the final 1-sorting pass is inevitably faced with Θ N 3 2  inversions, on the average. By contrast, 7-sorting followed by 5-sorting followed by 3-sorting jumbles things up in such a way that the final 1-sorting pass cannot encounter more than 2N inversions!  See exercise 26.  Indeed, an astonishing phenomenon occurs: Theorem K. If a k-ordered file is h-sorted, it remains k-ordered.  Thus a file that is first 7-sorted, then 5-sorted, becomes both 7-ordered and 5-ordered. And if we 3-sort it, the result is ordered by 7s, 5s, and 3s. Examples of this remarkable property can be seen in Table 4 on page 85. Proof. Exercise 20 shows that Theorem K is a consequence of the following fact: Lemma L. Let m, n, r be nonnegative integers, and let  x1, . . . , xm+r  and  y1, . . . , yn+r  be any sequences of numbers such that  yr ≤ xm+r.  y2 ≤ xm+2,  y1 ≤ xm+1,  . . . ,   7  If the x’s and y’s are sorted independently, so that x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xm+r and y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn+r, the relations  7  will still be valid. Proof. All but m of the x’s are known to dominate  that is, to be greater than or equal to  some y, where distinct x’s dominate distinct y’s. Let 1 ≤ j ≤ r. Since xm+j after sorting dominates m + j of the x’s, it dominates at least j of the y’s; therefore it dominates the smallest j of the y’s; hence xm+j ≥ yj after sorting.  Theorem K suggests that it is desirable to sort with relatively prime incre- ments, but it does not lead directly to exact estimates of the number of moves made in Algorithm D. Moreover, the number of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} that are both h-ordered and k-ordered is not always a divisor of n!, so we can see that Theorem K does not tell the whole story; some k- and h-ordered files are obtained more often than others after k- and h-sorting. Therefore the average- case analysis of Algorithm D for general increments ht−1, . . . , h0 has baffled everyone so far when t > 3. There is not even an obvious way to find the worst   SORTING BY INSERTION  5.2.1 91 case, when N and  ht−1, . . . , h0  are given. We can, however, derive several facts about the approximate maximum running time when the increments have certain forms: Theorem P. The running time of Algorithm D is O N 3 2 , when hs = 2s+1 −1 for 0 ≤ s < t = ⌊lg N⌋. we may use the obvious bound Bs = Ohs N hs 2; and for subsequent passes It suffices to bound Bs, the number of moves in pass s, in such a way Proof. that Bt−1 + ··· + B0 = O N 3 2 . During the first t 2 passes, for t > s ≥ t 2, Bt−1 + ··· + B0 = ON 2 + 22 + ··· + 2t 2 + 2t 2 + ··· + 2  = O N 3 2 . we may use the result of exercise 23, Bs = O N hs+2hs+1 hs . Consequently  This theorem is due to A. A. Papernov and G. V. Stasevich, Problemy Peredachi Informatsii 1, 3  1965 , 81–98. It gives an upper bound on the worst- case running time of the algorithm, not merely a bound on the average running time. The result is not trivial since the maximum running time when the h’s satisfy the divisibility constraint  5  is of order N 2; and exercise 24 shows that the exponent 3 2 cannot be lowered.  An interesting improvement of Theorem P was discovered by Vaughan Pratt in 1969: If the increments are chosen to be the set of all numbers of the form 2p3q that are less than N, the running time of Algorithm D is of order N log N 2. In this case we can also make several important simplifications to the algorithm; see exercises 30 and 31. However, even with these simplifications, Pratt’s method requires a substantial overhead because it makes quite a few passes over the data. Therefore his increments don’t actually sort faster than those of Theorem P in practice, unless N is astronomically large. The best sequences for real-world N appear to satisfy hs ≈ ρs, where the ratio ρ ≈ hs+1 hs is roughly independent of s but may depend on N. We have observed that it is unwise to choose increments in such a way that each is a divisor of all its predecessors; but we should not conclude that the best increments are relatively prime to all of their predecessors. Indeed, every element of a file that is gh-sorted and gk-sorted with h ⊥ k has at most 1 2 h − 1  k − 1  inversions when we are g-sorting.  See exercise 21.  Pratt’s sequence {2p3q} wins as N → ∞ by exploiting this fact, but it grows too slowly for practical use. Janet Incerpi and Robert Sedgewick [J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 31  1985 , 210–224; see also Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 1136  1996 , 1–11] have found a way to have the best of both worlds, by showing how to construct a sequence of increments for which hs ≈ ρs yet each increment is the gcd of two of its predecessors. Given any number ρ > 1, they start by defining a base sequence a1, a2, . . . , where ak is the least integer ≥ ρk such that aj ⊥ ak for 1 ≤ j < k. If ρ = 2.5, for example, the base sequence is  a1, a2, a3, . . . = 3, 7, 16, 41, 101, 247, 613, 1529, 3821, 9539, . . . .  Now they define the increments by setting h0 = 1 and   r    2  < s ≤ r + 1    .  2  hs = hs−r ar  for   8    92  SORTING  Thus the sequence of increments starts  5.2.1  1; a1; a2, a1a2; a1a3, a2a3, a1a2a3; . . . .  For example, when ρ = 2.5 we get  1, 3, 7, 21, 48, 112, 336, 861, 1968, 4592, 13776, 33936, 86961, 198768, . . . .  The crucial point is that we can turn recurrence  8  around:   r − 1   ≤ s <  2   r    .  2   9   hs = hr+s ar = h r  2  a r  2 −s  for  Therefore, by the argument in the previous paragraph, the number of inversions per element when we are h0-sorting, h1-sorting, . . . is at most  b a2, a1 ; b a3, a2 , b a3, a1 ; b a4, a3 , b a4, a2 , b a4, a1 ; . . .   10  2 h − 1  k − 1 . If ρt−1 ≤ N < ρt, the total number B of moves where b h, k  = 1 is at most N times the sum of the first t elements of this sequence. Therefore  see exercise 41  we can prove that the worst-case running time is much better than order N 1.5: Theorem I. The running time for Algorithm D is O N ec√ln N  when the increments hs are defined by  8 . Here c = 8 ln ρ and the constant implied by O depends on ρ.  √  This asymptotic upper bound is not especially important as N → ∞, because Pratt’s sequence does better. The main point of Theorem I is that a sequence of increments with the practical growth rate hs ≈ ρs can have a running time that is guaranteed to be O N 1+ϵ  for arbitrarily small ϵ > 0, when any value ρ > 1 is given. Let’s consider practical sizes of N more carefully by looking at the total running time of Program D, namely  9B+10N T +13T −10S−3A+1 u. Table 5 shows the average running time for various sequences of increments when N = 8. For this small value of N, bookkeeping operations are the most significant part of the cost, and the best results are obtained when t = 1; hence for N = 8 we are better off using simple straight insertion.  The average running time of Program S when N = 8 is only 191.85u.  Curiously, the best two-pass algorithm occurs when h1 = 6, since a large value of S is more important here than a small value of B. Similarly, the three increments 3 2 1 minimize the average number of moves, but they do not lead to the best three-pass sequence. It may be of interest to record here some “worst-case” permutations that maximize the number of moves, since the general construction of such permutations is still unknown:  h2 = 5, h1 = 3, h0 = 1: h2 = 3, h1 = 2, h0 = 1:  8 5 2 6 3 7 4 1 8 3 5 7 2 4 6 1   19 moves   17 moves    5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  93  ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM D WHEN N = 8  Increments  1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 4 2 1 5 3 1 3 2 1  Aave 1.718 2.667 2.917 3.083 2.601 2.135 1.718 3.500 3.301 3.320  Table 5  Bave 14.000 9.657 9.100 10.000 10.000 10.667 12.000 8.324 8.167 7.829  S 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 9 6  T 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3  MIX time 204.85u 235.91u 220.15u 217.75u 209.20u 206.60u 209.85u 274.42u 253.60u 280.50u  As N grows larger we have a slightly different picture. Table 6 shows the approximate number of moves for various sequences of increments when N = 1000. The first few entries satisfy the divisibility constraints  5 , so that formula  6  and exercise 19 can be used; empirical tests were used to get approximate average values for the other cases. Ten thousand random files of 1000 elements were generated, and they each were sorted with each of the sequences of increments. The standard deviation of the number of left-to-right minima A was usually about 15; the standard deviation of the number of moves B was usually about 300. Some patterns are evident in this data, but the behavior of Algorithm D still remains very obscure. Shell originally suggested using the increments ⌊N 2⌋, ⌊N 4⌋, ⌊N 8⌋, . . . , but this is undesirable when the binary representation of N contains a long string of zeros. Lazarus and Frank [CACM 3  1960 , 20–22] suggested using essentially the same sequence, but adding 1 when necessary, to make all increments odd. Hibbard [CACM 6  1963 , 206–213] suggested using increments of the form 2k − 1; Papernov and Stasevich suggested the form 2k + 1. Other natural sequences investigated in Table 6 involve the numbers Sedgewick sequences  8  for ρ = 2.5 and ρ = 2. Pratt-like sequences {5p11q}  2k −  −1 k 3 and  3k − 1  2, as well as Fibonacci numbers and the Incerpi– and {7p13q} are also shown, because they retain the asymptotic ON log N 2  behavior but have lower overhead costs for small N. The final examples in Table 6 come from another sequence devised by Sedgewick, based on slightly different heuristics [J. Algorithms 7  1986 , 159–173]:   9 · 2s − 9 · 2s 2 + 1,  8 · 2s − 6 · 2 s+1  2 + 1,  hs =  if s is even; if s is odd.   11   When these increments  h0, h1, h2, . . .   =  1, 5, 19, 41, 109, 209, . . .   are used, Sedgewick proved that the worst-case running time is O N 4 3 .  The minimum number of moves, about 6750, was observed for increments of the form 2k + 1, and also in the Incerpi–Sedgewick sequence for ρ = 2. But it is important to realize that the number of moves is not the only consideration,   94  SORTING  5.2.1  APPROXIMATE BEHAVIOR OF ALGORITHM D WHEN N = 1000  Table 6  Increments  Aave  Bave T 1 6 249750 1 2 41667 17 1 65 3 6 1 158 26361 4 21913 4 1 262 5 20459 4 1 362 6 20088 4 1 419 18533 3 1 378 7 16435 10 2 1 493 9 7655 3 1 516 9 7370 3 1 558 9 7200 3 1 559 3 1 436 7445 8 7 8170 3 1 299 6 9860 3 1 190 13615 3 1 114 5 6745 10 3 1 561 3 1 440 6995 9 8 7700 3 1 304 7 9300 3 1 197 12695 3 1 122 6 3 1 511 7365 10 9 7490 3 1 490 6 8620 3 1 373 6 8990 3 1 375 9345 3 1 410 6 2 1 518 7400 13 7610 12 2 1 432 7 8795 3 1 456 7 8085 2 1 440 4 1 437 8900 6 5 9790 4 1 268 7 7840 3 1 432 9 6755 2 1 465 6 8698 7 1 349 5 1 446 6788 8 7 7201 3 1 359 8 7725 5 1 512 7 7790 5 1 519 5 1 382 8165 6  60 140 20 64 16 48 16 9 27 8 4 7 15 7 15 7 15 15 7 7 15 7 15 7 15 5 9 9 5 5 9 5 9 5 9 11 5 5 11 7 15 5 17 5 21 5 3 3 5 8 21 14 5 40 13 40 13 7 21 10 5 49 13 25 11 16 7 41 19 41 19 41 19  512 256 128  513 257 129 257 129 129  683 341 171 341 171  729 243 64 32 62 500 250 125 63 501 251 125 63 511 255 127 255 127 63 63 127 63  85 85  65 65 65 65  256 576 192 81 16 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 17 17 17 17 17 21 21 63 65 85 8 8 55 41 364 121 121 48 18 91 55 37 929 505 209 109 505 209 109 209 109  33 33 33 33 33 43 43 255 257 341 13 21 21 13 377 144 365 122  336 112 45 90 169 275 125 121 84  34 34  190  306 170  377 233 144 233 144  89 89  55 55  even though it dominates the asymptotic running time. Since Program D takes 9B + 10 N T − S  + ··· units of time, we see that saving one pass is about as desirable as saving 10 9 N moves; when N = 1000 we are willing to add 1111 moves if we can save one pass.  The first pass is very quick, however, if ht−1 is near N, because N T − S =  N − ht−1  + ··· +  N − h0 .    5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  95  Empirical tests conducted by M. A. Weiss [Comp. J. 34  1991 , 88–91] suggest strongly that the average number of moves performed by Algorithm D with increments 2k − 1, . . . , 15, 7, 3, 1 is approximately proportional to N 5 4. More precisely, Weiss found that Bave ≈ 1.55N 5 4 − 4.48N + O N 3 4  for 100 ≤ N ≤ 12000000 when these increments are used; the empirical standard deviation was approximately .065N 5 4. On the other hand, subsequent tests by Marcin Ciura show that Sedgewick’s sequence  11  apparently makes Bave = small for N ≤ 106, but it mysteriously begins to “explode” when N passes 107. Table 7 shows typical breakdowns of moves per pass obtained in three random experiments, using increments of the forms 2k − 1, 2k + 1, and  11 . The same file of numbers was used in each case.

If N is less than 1000, a simple rule such as  Let h0 = 1, hs+1 = 3hs + 1, and stop with ht−1 when ht+1 > N   12  seems to be about as good as any other. For larger values of N, Sedgewick’s sequence  11  can be recommended. Still better results, possibly even of order N log N, have been reported by N.

Let us now leave shellsort and consider other types of im- provements over straight insertion. One of the most important general ways to improve on a given algorithm is to examine its data structures carefully, since   96  SORTING  5.2.1  a reorganization of data structures to avoid unnecessary operations often leads to substantial savings. Further discussion of this general idea appears in Section 2.4, where a rather complex algorithm is studied; let us consider how it applies to a very simple algorithm like straight insertion. What is the most appropriate data structure for Algorithm S?  Straight insertion involves two basic operations:  i  scanning an ordered file to find the largest key less than or equal to a given  key; and  ii  inserting a new record into a specified part of the ordered file. The file is obviously a linear list, and Algorithm S handles this list by using sequential allocation  Section 2.2.2 ; therefore it is necessary to move roughly half of the records in order to accomplish each insertion operation. On the other hand, we know that linked allocation  Section 2.2.3  is ideally suited to insertion, since only a few links need to be changed; and the other operation, sequential scanning, is about as easy with linked allocation as with sequential allocation. Only one-way linkage is needed, since we always scan the list in the same direction. Therefore we conclude that the right data structure for straight insertion is a one-way, linked linear list. It also becomes convenient to revise Algorithm S so that the list is scanned in increasing order: Algorithm L  List insertion . Records R1, . . . , RN are assumed to contain keys K1, . . . , KN, together with link fields L1, . . . , LN capable of holding the numbers 0 through N; there is also an additional link field L0, in an artificial record R0 at the beginning of the file. This algorithm sets the link fields so that the records are linked together in ascending order. Thus, if p 1  . . . p N  is the stable permutation that makes Kp 1  ≤ ··· ≤ Kp N , this algorithm will yield Lp N  = 0.   13  L1. [Loop on j.] Set L0 ← N, LN ← 0.  Link L0 acts as the “head” of the list, and 0 acts as a null link; hence the list is essentially circular.  Perform steps L2 through L5 for j = N−1, N−2, . . . , 1; then terminate the algorithm.  for 1 ≤ i < N;  Lp i  = p i + 1 ,  L2. [Set up p, q, K.] Set p ← L0, q ← 0, K ← Kj.  In the following steps we will insert Rj into its proper place in the linked list, by comparing K with the previous keys in ascending order. The variables p and q act as pointers to the current place in the list, with p = Lq so that q is one step behind p.  L3. [Compare K : Kp.] If K ≤ Kp, go to step L5.  We have found the desired L4. [Bump p, q.] Set q ← p, p ← Lq. If p > 0, go back to step L3.  If p = 0, K is the largest key found so far; hence record R belongs at the end of the list, between Rq and R0.   position for record R, between Rq and Rp in the list.   L0 = p 1 ;  L5. [Insert into list.] Set Lq ← j, Lj ← p.  This algorithm is important not only because it is a simple sorting method, but also because it occurs frequently as part of other list-processing algorithms.   5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  97  Table 8 shows the first few steps that occur when our sixteen example numbers are sorted; exercise 32 gives the final link setting.

N − 1 N − 1 N − 1  N − 1 N − 1  The running time of this program is 7B + 14N − 3A − 6 units, where N is the length of the file, A + 1 is the number of right-to-left maxima, and B is the number of inversions in the original permutation.  See the analysis of Program S. Note that Program L does not rearrange the records in memory; this can be done as in exercise 5.2–12, at a cost of about 20N additional units of time.  Program S requires  9B + 10N − 3A − 9 u, and since B is about 1 4 N 2, we can see that the extra memory space used for the link fields has saved about 22 percent of the execution time. Another 22 percent can be saved by careful programming  see exercise 33 , but the running time remains proportional to N 2.  To summarize what we have done so far: We started with Algorithm S, a simple and natural sorting algorithm that does about 1 4 N 2 comparisons and 1 4 N 2 moves. We improved it in one direction by considering binary insertion, which does about N lg N comparisons and 1 4 N 2 moves. Changing the data  B B B  N N   98  SORTING  5.2.1  Fig. 13. Example of Wheeler’s tree insertion scheme.  structure slightly with “two-way insertion” cuts the number of moves down to about 1 8 N 2. Shellsort cuts the number of comparisons and moves to about N 7 6, for N in a practical range; as N → ∞ this number can be lowered to order N log N 2. Another way to improve on Algorithm S, using a linked data structure, gave us the list insertion method, which does about 1 4 N 2 comparisons, 0 moves, and 2N changes of links. Is it possible to marry the best features of these methods, reducing the number of comparisons to order N log N as in binary insertion, yet reducing the number of moves as in list insertion? The answer is yes, by going to a tree-structured arrangement. This possibility was first explored about 1957 by D. J. Wheeler, who suggested using two-way insertion until it becomes necessary to move some data; then instead of moving the data, a pointer to another area of memory is inserted, and the same technique is applied recursively to all items that are to be inserted into this new area of memory. Wheeler’s original method [see A. S. Douglas, Comp. J. 2  1959 , 5] was a complicated combination of sequential and linked memory, with nodes of varying size; for our 16 example numbers the tree of Fig. 13 would be formed. A similar but simpler tree-insertion scheme, using binary trees, was devised by C. M. Berners-Lee about 1958 [see Comp. J. 3  1960 , 174, 184]. Since the binary tree method and its refinements are quite important for searching as well as sorting, they are discussed at length in Section 6.2.2.  Still another way to improve on straight insertion is to consider inserting several things at a time. For example, if we have a file of 1000 items, and if 998 of them have already been sorted, Algorithm S makes two more passes through the file  first inserting R999, then R1000 . We can obviously save time if we compare K999 with K1000, to see which is larger, then insert them both with one look at the file. A combined operation of this kind involves about 2 3 N comparisons and moves  see exercise 3.4.2–5 , instead of two passes each with about 1  2 N comparisons and moves.  In other words, it is generally a good idea to “batch” operations that require long searches, so that multiple operations can be done together. If we carry this idea to its natural conclusion, we rediscover the method of sorting by merging, which is so important it is discussed in Section 5.2.4.  061 087 503 512 908  154 170 275 426  509  612 653 897  677 765  703   5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  99  Address calculation sorting. Surely by now we have exhausted all possible ways to improve on the simple method of straight insertion; but let’s look again! Suppose you want to arrange several dozen books on your bookshelves, in order by authors’ names, when the books are given to you in random order. You’ll naturally try to estimate the final position of each book as you put it in place, thereby reducing the number of comparisons and moves that you’ll have to make. And the whole process will be somewhat more efficient if you start with a little more shelf space than is absolutely necessary. This method was first suggested for computer sorting by Isaac and Singleton, JACM 3  1956 , 169–174, and it was developed further by Tarter and Kronmal, Proc. ACM National Conference 21  1966 , 331–337.  Address calculation sorting usually requires additional storage space propor- tional to N, either to leave enough room so that excessive moving is not required, or to maintain auxiliary tables that account for irregularities in the distribution of keys.  See the “distribution counting” sort, Algorithm 5.2D, which is a form of address calculation.  We can probably make the best use of this additional memory space if we devote it to link fields, as in the list insertion method. In this way we can also avoid having separate areas for input and output; everything can be done in the same area of memory.  These considerations suggest that we generalize list insertion so that several lists are kept, not just one. Each list is used for certain ranges of keys. We make the important assumption that the keys are pretty evenly distributed, not “bunched up” irregularly: The set of all possible values of the keys is partitioned into M parts, and we assume a probability of 1 M that a given key falls into a given part. Then we provide additional storage for M list heads, and each list is maintained as in simple list insertion.  It is not necessary to give the algorithm in great detail here; the method simply begins with all list heads set to Λ. As each new item enters, we first decide which of the M parts its key falls into, then we insert it into the corresponding list as in Algorithm L.  To illustrate this approach, suppose that the 16 keys used in our examples are divided into the M = 4 ranges 0–249, 250–499, 500–749, 750–999. We obtain the following configurations as the keys K1, K2, . . . , K16 are successively inserted:  After 4 items: 8 items:  After  After 12 items: 061, 087, 154, 170 275, 426 503, 509, 512, 653 897, 908  Final state: 061, 087, 154, 170 275, 426 503, 509, 512, 612, 653, 677, 703 765, 897, 908  061, 087, 170 275 503, 512 897, 908  List 1: 061, 087 List 2: List 3: 503, 512 List 4:  Program M below actually inserts the keys in reverse order, K16, . . . , K2, K1, but the final result is the same.  Because linked memory is used, the varying- length lists cause no storage allocation problem. All lists can be combined into a single list at the end, if desired  see exercise 35 .   100  SORTING  5.2.1  Program M  Multiple list insertion . In this program we make the same assumptions as in Program L, except that the keys must be nonnegative, thus  0 ≤ Kj <  BYTESIZE 3.

The most notable contrast between Program L and Program M is the fact that Program M must consider the case of an empty list, when no comparisons are to be made. How much time do we save by having M lists? The total running time of Program M is 7B + 31N − 3A + 4M + 2 units, where M is the number of lists and N is the number of records sorted; A and B respectively count the right-to- left maxima and the inversions present among the keys belonging to each list.  In contrast to other time analyses of this section, the rightmost element of a nonempty permutation is included in the count A.  We have already studied A and B for M = 1, when their average values are respectively HN and 1 2 By our assumption about the distribution of keys, the probability that a given list contains precisely n items at the conclusion of sorting is the “binomial” probability  N  .  2   N   1  n  N−n  n  M  1 − 1  M  .   14    Using the identity   15    16    17   which is a special case of Eq. 1.2.6– 20 , we can easily evaluate the sum in  16 :  5.2.1  SORTING BY INSERTION  101  Therefore the average values of A and B in the general case are  Aave = M  Bave = M  n     N  n  n  M  n   N  1  N  1   n  n  M  =  2  2  M  M  Hn;  1 − 1   2.  N−n N−n n   n n 1 − 1  N − 2  N   N −N HN − ln M  + ϵ,  n − 2  2  2  .  ,  1 n  1 − 1  M  n−N   <  M − 1 N + 1 ; N+1  Bave = 1 2M  0 < ϵ =   n>N       N  And exercise 37 derives the standard deviation of B.

However, the maximum time is much larger than the average time; this reiterates the assumption we have made about a fairly equal distribution of keys, since the worst case occurs when all records pile onto the same list.  If we set M = N, the average running time of Program M is approximately 34.36N units; when M = 1 2 N it is slightly more, approximately 34.52N; and when M = 1 10 N it is approximately 48.04N. The additional cost of the sup- plementary program in exercise 35, which links all M lists together in a single list, raises these times respectively to 44.99N, 41.95N, and 52.74N.

Sorting by Exchanging We come now to the second family of sorting algorithms mentioned near the beginning of Section 5.2: “exchange” or “transposition” methods that system- atically interchange pairs of elements that are out of order until no more such pairs exist.  The process of straight insertion, Algorithm 5.2.1S, can be viewed as an exchange method: We take each new record Rj and essentially exchange it with its neighbors to the left until it has been inserted into the proper place.

The bubble sort in action.  “exchange,” “selection,” etc., is not always clear-cut. In this section, we shall discuss four types of sorting methods for which exchanging is a dominant char- acteristic: exchange selection  the “bubble sort” ; merge exchange  Batcher’s parallel sort ; partition exchange  Hoare’s “quicksort” ; and radix exchange. The bubble sort. Perhaps the most obvious way to sort by exchanges is to compare K1 with K2, interchanging R1 and R2 if the keys are out of order; then do the same to records R2 and R3, R3 and R4, etc. During this sequence of operations, records with large keys tend to move to the right, and in fact the record with the largest key will move up to become RN. Repetitions of the process will get the appropriate records into positions RN−1, RN−2, etc., so that all records will ultimately be sorted. Figure 14 shows this sorting method in action on the sixteen keys 503 087 512 . . . 703; it is convenient to represent the file of numbers vertically instead of horizontally, with RN at the top and R1 at the bottom. The method is called “bubble sorting” because large elements “bubble up” to their proper position, by contrast with the “sinking sort”  that is, straight insertion  in which elements sink down to an appropriate level. The bubble sort is also known by more prosaic names such as “exchange selection” or “propagation.”  After each pass through the file, it is not hard to see that all records above and including the last one to be exchanged must be in their final position, so   5.2.2  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  107  they need not be examined on subsequent passes. Horizontal lines in Fig. 14 show the progress of the sorting from this standpoint; notice, for example, that five more elements are known to be in final position as a result of Pass 4. On the final pass, no exchanges are performed at all. With these observations we are ready to formulate the algorithm. Algorithm B  Bubble sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. B1. [Initialize BOUND.] Set BOUND ← N.

It is quite instructive to analyze the running time of Algorithm B. Three quantities are involved in the timing: the number of passes, A; the number of exchanges, B; and the number of comparisons, C. If the input keys are distinct and in random order, we may assume that they form a random permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. The idea of inversion tables  Section 5.1.1  leads to an easy way to describe the effect of each pass in a bubble sort. Theorem I. Let a1 a2 . . . an be a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}, and let b1 b2 . . . bn be the corresponding inversion table. If one pass of the bubble sort, Algorithm B, changes a1 a2 . . . an to the permutation a′1 a′2 . . . a′n, the corresponding inversion table b′1 b′2 . . . b′n is obtained from b1 b2 . . . bn by decreasing each nonzero entry by 1. If ai is preceded by a larger element, the largest preceding element is Proof. exchanged with it, so bai decreases by 1. But if ai is not preceded by a larger element, it is never exchanged with a larger element, so bai remains 0.  Thus we can see what happens during a bubble sort by studying the sequence of inversion tables between passes. For example, the successive inversion tables corresponding to Fig. 14 are  Pass 1 Pass 2 Pass 3  3 1 8 3 4 5 0 4 0 3 2 2 3 2 1 0 2 0 7 2 3 4 0 3 0 2 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 6 1 2 3 0 2 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   1   and so on. If b1 b2 . . . bn is the inversion table of the input permutation, we must therefore have   2   3   4  where cj is the value of BOUND − 1 at the beginning of pass j. In terms of the inversion table,  A = 1 + max  b1, b2, . . . , bn , B = b1 + b2 + ··· + bn, C = c1 + c2 + ··· + cA,  cj = max {bi + i  bi ≥ j − 1} − j   5   see exercise 5 . In example  1  we therefore have A = 9, B = 41, C = 15 + 14 + 13 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 75. The total MIX sorting time for Fig. 14 is 960u. The distribution of B  the total number of inversions in a random permu- tation  is very well-known to us by now; so we are left with A and C to be analyzed. The probability that A ≤ k is 1 n! times the number of inversion tables having no components ≥ k, namely kn−kk!, when 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Hence the probability that exactly k passes are required is  kn−kk! −  k − 1 n−k+1 k − 1 !.

For the standard deviation of A, see exercise 7.  kn−kk! n! = n + 1 − P n ,  The total number of comparisons, C, is somewhat harder to handle, and we will consider only Cave. For fixed n, let fj k  be the number of inversion tables b1 . . . bn such that for 1 ≤ i ≤ n we have either bi < j − 1 or bi + i − j ≤ k; then  8    See exercise 8.  The average value of cj in  5  is kfj k  − fj k − 1  n!;  fj k  =  j + k !  j − 1 n−j−k,  for 0 ≤ k ≤ n − j.   7   summing by parts and then summing on j leads to the formula   n + 1  2   − 1  n!    Cave =  fj k  =  1≤j≤n 0≤k≤n−j   n + 1  2   − 1  n!    0≤r<s≤n  s! rn−s.   9   Here the asymptotic value is not easy to determine, and we shall return to it at the end of this section.  To summarize our analysis of the bubble sort, the formulas derived above  and below may be written as follows:  A =min 1, ave N −πN 2 + O 1 , max N; B =min 0, ave 1 2 N 2 − N ; C =min N − 1, ave 1 2 N 2 − N .  4 N 2 − N , max 1  N 2 − N ln N −  γ + ln 2 − 1 N + O√  max 1  2   12  In each case the minimum occurs when the input is already in order, and the maximum occurs when it is in reverse order; so the MIX running time is 8A +  7B + 8C + 1 =min 8N + 1, ave 5.75N 2 + O N log N , max 7.5N 2 + 0.5N + 1.  N,   10   11   Refinements of the bubble sort. It took a good deal of work to analyze the bubble sort; and although the techniques used in the calculations are instructive, the results are disappointing since they tell us that the bubble sort isn’t really very good at all. Compared to straight insertion  Algorithm 5.2.1S , bubble sorting requires a more complicated program and takes more than twice as long! Some of the bubble sort’s deficiencies are easy to spot. For example, in Fig. 14, the first comparison in Pass 4 is redundant, as are the first two in Pass 5 and the first three in Passes 6 and 7. Notice also that elements can never move to the left more than one step per pass; so if the smallest item happens to be initially at the far right we are forced to make the maximum number of   110  SORTING  5.2.2  703 765 677 612 509 154 426 653 275 897 170 908 061 512 087 503  908 765 703 677 612 509 426 653 275 897 170 512 154 503 087 061  908 908 897 703 765 765 703 677 677 612 653 509 612 154 512 426 509 653 503 275 426 897 275 170 170 512 154 061 087 503 087 061 Fig. 16.

This suggests the “cocktail-shaker sort,” in which alternate passes go in opposite directions  see Fig. 16 . The average number of comparisons is slightly reduced by this approach. K. E. Iverson [A Programming Language  Wiley, 1962 , 218–219] made an interesting observation in this regard: If j is an index such that Rj and Rj+1 are not exchanged with each other on two consecutive passes in opposite directions, then Rj and Rj+1 must be in their final position, and they need not enter into any subsequent comparisons. For example, traversing 4 3 2 1 8 6 9 7 5 from left to right yields 3 2 1 4 6 8 7 5 9; no interchange occurred between R4 and R5. When we traverse the latter permutation from right to left, we find R4 still less than  the new  R5, so we may immediately conclude that R4 and R5 need not participate in any further comparisons.  But none of these refinements lead to an algorithm better than straight insertion; and we already know that straight insertion isn’t suitable for large N. Another idea is to eliminate most of the exchanges; since most elements simply shift left one step during an exchange, we could achieve the same effect by viewing the array differently, shifting the origin of indexing! But the resulting algorithm is no better than straight selection, Algorithm 5.2.3S, which we shall study later. In short, the bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems. Batcher’s parallel method. If we are going to have an exchange algorithm whose running time is faster than order N 2, we need to select some nonadjacent pairs of keys  Ki, Kj  for comparisons; otherwise we will need as many exchanges   5.2.2  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  111  as the original permutation has inversions, and the average number of inversions 4 N 2 − N . An ingenious way to program a sequence of comparisons, looking is 1 for potential exchanges, was discovered in 1964 by K. E. Batcher [see Proc. AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference 32  1968 , 307–314]. His method is not at all obvious; in fact, a fairly intricate proof is needed just to show that it is valid, since comparatively few comparisons are made. We shall discuss two proofs, one in this section and another in Section 5.3.4.  Fig. 17. Algorithm M.  Batcher’s sorting scheme is similar to shellsort, but the comparisons are done in a novel way so that no propagation of exchanges is necessary. We can, for instance, compare Table 1  on the next page  to Table 5.2.1–3; Batcher’s method achieves the effect of 8-sorting, 4-sorting, 2-sorting, and 1-sorting, but the comparisons do not overlap. Since Batcher’s algorithm essentially merges pairs of sorted subsequences, it may be called the “merge exchange sort.” Algorithm M  Merge exchange . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. We assume that N ≥ 2. M1. [Initialize p.] Set p ← 2t−1, where t = ⌈lg N⌉ is the least integer such that 2t ≥ N.  Steps M2 through M5 will be performed for p = 2t−1, 2t−2, . . . , 1.  M2.

Here i & p means the “bitwise and” of the binary representations of i and p; each bit of the result is zero except where both i and p have 1-bits in corresponding positions. Thus 13 & 21 =  1101 2 &  10101 2 =  00101 2 = 5. At this point, d is an odd multiple of p, and p is a power of 2, so that i & p ̸=  i + d  & p; it follows that the actions of step M4 can be done for all relevant i in any order, even simultaneously.  records Ri+1 ↔ Ri+d+1.

Notice that the algorithm sorts N elements essentially by sorting R1, R3, R5, . . . and R2, R4, R6, . . . independently; then we perform steps M2 through M5 for p = 1, in order to merge the two sorted sequences together.  In order to prove that the magic sequence of comparison exchanges specified in Algorithm M actually will sort all possible input files R1 R2 . . . RN, we must show only that steps M2 through M5 will merge all 2-ordered files R1 R2 . . . RN when p = 1. For this purpose we can use the lattice-path method of Section 5.2.1  see Fig. 11 on page 87 ; each 2-ordered permutation of {1, 2, . . . , N} corresponds uniquely to a path from  0, 0  to  ⌈N 2⌉, ⌊N 2⌋  in a lattice di- agram. Figure 18 a  shows an example for N = 16, corresponding to the permutation 1 3 2 4 10 5 11 6 13 7 14 8 15 9 16 12. When we perform step M3 with p = 1, q = 2t−1, r = 0, d = 1, the effect is to compare  and possibly exchange  R1 : R2, R3 : R4, etc. This operation corresponds to a simple transformation of the lattice path, “folding” it about the diagonal if necessary so that it never goes above the diagonal.  See Fig. 18 b  and the proof in exercise 10.  The   SORTING BY EXCHANGING  5.2.2 113 next iterations of step M3 have p = r = 1, and d = 2t−1 − 1, 2t−2 − 1, . . . , 1; their effect is to compare exchange R2 : R2+d, R4 : R4+d, etc., and again there is a simple lattice interpretation: The path is “folded” about a line 1 2 d + 1  units below the diagonal. See Fig. 18 c  and  d ; eventually we get to the path in Fig. 18 e , which corresponds to a completely sorted permutation. This completes a “geometric proof” that Batcher’s algorithm is valid; we might call it sorting by folding!  Fig. 18. A geometric interpretation of Batcher’s method, N = 16.  2⌈lg N⌉⌈lg N⌉ + 1 steps, and this is about as fast as any general method  A MIX program for Algorithm M appears in exercise 12. Unfortunately the amount of bookkeeping needed to control the sequence of comparisons is rather large, so the program is less efficient than other methods we have seen. But it has one important redeeming feature: All comparison exchanges specified by a given iteration of step M3 can be done simultaneously, on computers or networks that allow parallel computations. With such parallel operations, sorting is completed in 1 known. For example, 1024 elements can be sorted in only 55 parallel steps by Batcher’s method. The nearest competitor is Pratt’s method  see exercise 5.2.1– 30 , which uses either 40 or 73 steps, depending on how we count; if we are willing to allow overlapping comparisons as long as no overlapping exchanges are necessary, Pratt’s method requires only 40 comparison exchange cycles to sort 1024 elements. For further comments, see Section 5.3.4. Quicksort. The sequence of comparisons in Batcher’s method is predetermined; we compare the same pairs of keys each time, regardless of what we may have learned about the file from previous comparisons. The same is largely true of the bubble sort, although Algorithm B does make limited use of previous knowledge in order to reduce its work at the right end of the file. Let us now turn to a quite different strategy, which uses the result of each comparison to determine what keys are to be compared next. Such a strategy is inappropriate for parallel computations, but on computers that work serially it can be quite fruitful.  The basic idea of the following method is to take one record, say R1, and to move it to the final position that it should occupy in the sorted file, say position s. While determining this final position, we will also rearrange the other records so that there will be none with greater keys to the left of position s, and none with smaller keys to the right. Thus the file will have been partitioned in such a way   a    b    c    d    e    114  SORTING  5.2.2  that the original sorting problem is reduced to two simpler problems, namely to sort R1 . . . Rs−1 and  independently  to sort Rs+1 . . . RN. We can apply the same technique to each of these subfiles, until the job is done. There are several ways to achieve such a partitioning into left and right subfiles; the following scheme due to R. Sedgewick seems to be best, for reasons that will become clearer when we analyze the algorithm: Keep two pointers, i and j, with i = 2 and j = N initially. If Ri is eventually supposed to be part of the left-hand subfile after partitioning  we can tell this by comparing Ki with K1 , increase i by 1, and continue until encountering a record Ri that belongs to the right-hand subfile. Similarly, decrease j by 1 until encountering a record Rj belonging to the left-hand subfile. If i < j, exchange Ri with Rj; then move on to process the next records in the same way, “burning the candle at both ends” until i ≥ j. The partitioning is finally completed by exchanging Rj with R1. For example, consider what happens to our file of sixteen numbers:  i ↓  j ↓ [503 087 512 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 154 509 612 677 765 703] Initial file: 503 087 512 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 154 509 612 677 765 703 1st exchange: 503 087 154 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 512 509 612 677 765 703 2nd exchange: 503 087 154 061 426 170 897 275 653 908 512 509 612 677 765 703 3rd exchange: Pointers cross: 503 087 154 061 426 170 275 897 653 908 512 509 612 677 765 703 Partitioned file:[275 087 154 061 426 170]503[897 653 908 512 509 612 677 765 703]  ↑ j  ↑ i   In order to indicate the positions of i and j, keys Ki and Kj are shown here in boldface type.   Table 2 shows how our example file gets completely sorted by this approach, in 11 stages. Brackets indicate subfiles that still need to be sorted; double brackets identify the subfile of current interest. Inside a computer, the current subfile can be represented by boundary values  l, r , and the other subfiles by a stack of additional pairs  lk, rk . Whenever a file is subdivided, we put the longer subfile on the stack and commence work on the shorter one, until we reach trivially short files; this strategy guarantees that the stack will never contain more than lg N entries  see exercise 20 .  The sorting procedure just described may be called partition-exchange sort- ing; it is due to C. A. R. Hoare, whose interesting paper [Comp. J. 5  1962 , 10–15] contains one of the most comprehensive accounts of a sorting method that has ever been published. Hoare dubbed his method “quicksort,” and that name is not inappropriate, since the inner loops of the computation are extremely fast on most computers. All comparisons during a given stage are made against the same key, so this key may be kept in a register. Only a single index needs to be changed between comparisons.

The bookkeeping required to control i, j, and the stack is not difficult, but it makes the quicksort partitioning procedure most suitable for fairly large N. Therefore the following algorithm uses another strategy after the subfiles have become short. Algorithm Q  Quicksort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. An auxiliary stack with at most ⌊lg N⌋ entries is needed for temporary storage. This algorithm follows the quicksort partitioning procedure described in the text above, with slight modifications for extra efficiency: a  We assume the presence of artificial keys K0 = −∞ and KN+1 = +∞ such  K0 ≤ Ki ≤ KN+1  for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.   13   that   Equality is allowed.   b  Subfiles of M or fewer elements are left unsorted until the very end of the procedure; then a single pass of straight insertion is used to produce the final ordering. Here M ≥ 1 is a parameter that should be chosen as described in the text below.  This idea, due to R. Sedgewick, saves some of the overhead that would be necessary if we applied straight insertion directly to each small subfile, unless locality of reference is significant.   c  Records with equal keys are exchanged, although it is not strictly necessary to do so.  This idea, due to R. C. Singleton, keeps the inner loops fast and helps to split subfiles nearly in half when equal elements are present; see exercise 18.   Q1. [Initialize.] If N ≤ M, go to step Q9. Otherwise set the stack empty, and  set l ← 1, r ← N.   116  SORTING  5.2.2  Fig. 19. Partition-exchange sorting  quicksort .  Q2. [Begin new stage.]   We now wish to sort the subfile Rl . . . Rr; from the nature of the algorithm, we have r ≥ l + M, and Kl−1 ≤ Ki ≤ Kr+1 for l ≤ i ≤ r.  Set i ← l, j ← r +1; and set K ← Kl.  The text below discusses alternative choices for K that might be better.   Q3.

At this point,  14  holds except for k = i and k = j; also Ki ≥ K ≥ Kj, and r ≥ j ≥ i − 1 ≥ l.  If j ≤ i, interchange Rl ↔ Rj and go to step Q7.  Q5. [Test i: j.]  Q6.

If j − l > r− j > M, insert  l, j−1  on top of the stack, set l ← j +1, and go to Q2.  Each entry  a, b  on the stack is a request to sort the subfile Ra . . . Rb at some future time.

The analysis is particularly instructive because the algorithm is rather complex; the unraveling of this complexity makes a particularly good illustration of important techniques. However, nonmathematical readers are advised to skip to Eq.  25 .  As in most other analyses of this chapter, we shall assume that the keys to be sorted are distinct; exercise 18 indicates that equalities between keys do not seriously harm the efficiency of Algorithm Q, and in fact they seem to help it. Since the method depends only on the relative order of the keys, we may as well assume that they are simply {1, 2, . . . , N} in some order.  We can attack this problem by considering the behavior of the very first partitioning stage, which takes us to Q7 for the first time. Once this partitioning has been achieved, both of the subfiles R1 . . . Rj−1 and Rj+1 . . . RN will be in random order if the original file was in random order, since the relative order of elements in these subfiles has no effect on the partitioning algorithm. Therefore the contribution of subsequent partitionings can be determined by induction  on N. This is an important observation, since some alternative algorithms that Surveys 6  1974 , 287–289.  violate this property have turned out to be significantly slower; see Computing  Let s be the value of the first key, K1, and assume that exactly t of the first s keys {K1, . . . , Ks} are greater than s.  Remember that the keys being sorted are the integers {1, 2, . . . , N}.  If s = 1, it is easy to see what happens during the first stage of partitioning: Step Q3 is performed once, step Q4 is performed N times, and then step Q5 takes us to Q7. So the contributions of the first stage in this case are A = 1, B = 0, C = N + 1. A similar but slightly more complicated argument when s > 1  see exercise 21  shows that the contributions of the first stage to the total running time are, in general,  for 1 ≤ s ≤ N.  A = 1, B = t, C = N + 1,   17  To this we must add the contributions of the later stages, which sort subfiles of s − 1 and N − s elements, respectively.  If we assume that the original file is in random order, it is now possible to write down formulas that define the generating functions for the probability distributions of A, B, . . . , S  see exercise 22 . But for simplicity we shall consider here only the average values of these quantities, AN , BN , . . . , SN, as functions of N. Consider, for example, the average number of comparisons, CN, that occur during the partitioning process. When N ≤ M, CN = 0. Otherwise, since any given value of s occurs with probability 1 N, we have  N  s=1  CN = 1  N  = N + 1 + 2    N  0≤k<N   N + 1 + Cs−1 + CN−s   Ck,  for N > M.   18    120  SORTING  Similar formulas hold for other quantities AN, BN, DN, EN, SN  see exercise 23 .  There is a simple way to solve recurrence relations of the form  5.2.2   19   The first step is to get rid of the summation sign: Since    for n ≥ m.  n  xk,  xn = fn + 2  n + 1 xn+1 =  n + 1 fn+1 + 2   0≤k<n  xk,  nxn = nfn + 2   0≤k≤n  xk,  0≤k<n  we may subtract, obtaining   n + 1 xn+1 − nxn = gn + 2xn,  where gn =  n + 1 fn+1 − nfn.  Now the recurrence takes the much simpler form  n + 1 xn+1 =  n + 2 xn + gn,  for n ≥ m.   20   Any recurrence relation that has the general form anxn+1 = bnxn + gn   21  can be reduced to a summation if we multiply both sides by the “summation factor” a0 a1 . . . an−1 b0 b1 . . . bn; we obtain  yn+1 = yn + cn, where  yn = a0 . . . an−1 b0 . . . bn−1  xn,  cn = a0 . . . an−1 b0 b1 . . . bn  gn.   22   In our case  20 , the summation factor is simply n!  n + 2 ! = 1  n + 1  n + 2 , so we find that the simple relation  xn+1  n + 1 +  n + 1 fn+1 − nfn  n + 2 = xn is a consequence of  19 . xm  m + 1  for all n ≥ m. If we set fn = n + 1, we get   n + 1  n + 2   ,  For example, if we set fn = 1 n, we get the unexpected result xn  n + 1  =  for n ≥ m,   23   xn  n + 1  = 2  n + 1  + 2 n + ··· + 2  m + 2  + xm  m + 1   = 2  Hn+1 − Hm+1  + xm  m + 1 ,  for all n ≥ m. Thus we obtain the solution to  18  by setting m = M + 1 and xn = 0 for n ≤ M; the required formula is  CN =  N + 1   2HN+1 − 2HM+2 + 1    N + 1    ≈ 2  N + 1  ln  asymptotically 21 − 2π2  3 N; this is reasonably small compared to  24 .  Exercise 6.2.2–8 proves that, when M = 1, the standard deviation of CN is  M + 2  ,  for N > M.   24    The other quantities can be found in a similar way  see exercise 23 ; when  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  121  5.2.2  N > M we have  AN = 2  N + 1   M + 2  − 1, BN = 1  6  N + 1 2HN+1 − 2HM+2 + 1 − 6  M + 2  + 1  DN =  N + 1 1 − 2HM+1  M + 2 ,  2 ,  6  N + 1 M M − 1   M + 2 ;  EN = 1 SN =  N + 1   2M + 3  − 1,   25  The discussion above shows that it is possible to carry out an exact analysis of the average running time of a fairly complex program, by using techniques that we have previously applied only to simpler cases.  for N > 2M + 1.  Formulas  24  and  25  can be used to determine the best value of M on a particular computer. In MIX’s case, Program Q requires  35 3  N + 1 HN+1 + 6 N + 1 f M  − 34.5 units of time on the average, for N > 2M + 1, where 1  f M  = 8M − 70HM+2 + 71 − 36 HM+1  M + 2 + 270  M + 2 + 54  2M + 3 .   26   We want to choose M so that f M  is a minimum, and a simple computer calculation shows that M = 9 is best. The average running time of Program Q is approximately 11.667 N + 1  ln N − 1.74N − 18.74 units when M = 9, for large N.  So Program Q is quite fast, on the average, considering that it requires very little memory space. Its speed is primarily due to the fact that the inner loops, in steps Q3 and Q4, are extremely short — only three MIX instructions each  see lines 12–14 and 15–17 . The number of exchanges, in step Q6, is only about 1 6 of the number of comparisons in steps Q3 and Q4; hence we have saved a significant amount of time by not comparing i to j in the inner loops.  But what is the worst case of Algorithm Q? Are there some inputs that it does not handle efficiently? The answer to this question is quite embarrassing: If the original file is already in order, with K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, each “partitioning” operation is almost useless, since it reduces the size of the subfile by only one element! So this situation  which ought to be easiest of all to sort  makes quicksort anything but quick; the sorting time becomes proportional to N 2 instead of N lg N.  See exercise 25.  Unlike the other sorting methods we have seen, Algorithm Q likes a disordered file.  Hoare suggested two ways to remedy the situation, in his original paper, by choosing a better value of the test key K that governs the partitioning. One of his recommendations was to choose a random integer q between l and r in the last part of step Q2; we can change the instruction “K ← Kl” to Rl ← R   27  in that step.  The last assignment “Rl ← R” is necessary; otherwise step Q4 would stop with j = l − 1 when K is the smallest key of the subfile being  Rq ← Rl,  K ← Kq,  R ← Rq,   122  SORTING  5.2.2  partitioned.  According to Eqs.  25 , such random integers need to be calculated only 2  N + 1   M + 2 − 1 times on the average, so the additional running time is not substantial; and the random choice gives good protection against the occurrence of the worst case. Even a mildly random choice of q should be safe. Exercise 42 proves that, with truly random q, the probability of more than, say, 20N ln N comparisons will surely be less than 10−8.  Hoare’s second suggestion was to look at a small sample of the file and to choose a median value of the sample. This approach was adopted by R. C. Singleton [CACM 12  1969 , 185–187], who suggested letting Kq be the median of the three values  Kl,  Kr.  K⌊ l+r  2⌋,   28  Singleton’s procedure cuts the number of comparisons down from 2N ln N to about 12 7 N ln N  see exercise 29 . It can be shown that BN is asymptotically CN  5 instead of CN  6 in this case, so the median method slightly increases the amount of time spent in transferring the data; the total running time therefore decreases by roughly 8 percent.  See exercise 56 for a detailed analysis.  The worst case is still of order N 2, but such slow behavior will hardly ever occur. W. D. Frazer and A. C. McKellar [JACM 17  1970 , 496–507] have suggested taking a much larger sample consisting of 2k − 1 records, where k is chosen so that 2k ≈ N ln N. The sample can be sorted by the usual quicksort method, then inserted among the remaining records by taking k passes over the file  partitioning it into 2k subfiles, bounded by the elements of the sample . Finally the subfiles are sorted. The average number of comparisons required by such a “samplesort” procedure is about the same as in Singleton’s median method, when N is in a practical range, but it decreases to the asymptotic value N lg N as N → ∞.  An absolute guarantee of O N log N  sorting time in the worst case, together with fast running time on the average, can be obtained by combining quicksort with other schemes. For example, D. R. Musser [Software Practice & Exper. 27  1997 , 983–993] has suggested adding a “depth of partitioning” component to each entry on quicksort’s stack. If any subfile is found to have been subdivided more than, say, 2 lg N times, we can abandon Algorithm Q and switch to Al- gorithm 5.2.3H. The inner loop time remains unchanged, so the average total running time remains almost the same as before.  Robert Sedgewick has analyzed a number of optimized variants of quicksort in Acta Informatica 7  1977 , 327–356, and in CACM 21  1978 , 847–857, 22  1979 , 368. See also J. L. Bentley and M. D. McIlroy, Software Practice & Exper. 23  1993 , 1249–1265, for a version of quicksort that has been tuned up to fit the UNIX R⃝software library, based on 15 further years of experience.  Radix exchange. We come now to a method that is quite different from any of the sorting schemes we have seen before; it makes use of the binary representation of the keys, so it is intended only for binary computers. Instead of comparing two keys with each other, this method inspects individual bits of   5.2.2  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  123  the keys, to see if they are 0 or 1. In other respects it has the characteristics of exchange sorting, and, in fact, it is rather similar to quicksort. Since it depends on radix 2 representations, we call it “radix exchange sorting.” The algorithm can be described roughly as follows:  i  Sort the sequence on its most significant binary bit, so that all keys that have a leading 0 come before all keys that have a leading 1. This sorting is done by finding the leftmost key Ki that has a leading 1, and the rightmost key Kj with a leading 0. Then Ri and Rj are exchanged and the process is repeated until i > j. ii  Let F0 be the elements with leading bit 0, and let F1 be the others. Apply the radix exchange sorting method to F0  starting now at the second bit from the left instead of the most significant bit , until F0 is completely sorted; then do the same for F1.  For example, Table 3 shows how the radix exchange sort acts on our 16 random numbers, which have been converted to octal notation. Stage 1 in the table shows the initial input, and after exchanging on the first bit we get to stage 2. Stage 2 sorts the first group on bit 2, and stage 3 works on bit 3.  The reader should mentally convert the octal notation to 10-bit binary numbers. For example, 0232 stands for  0 010 011 010 2.  When we reach stage 5, after sorting on bit 4, we find that each group remaining has but a single element, so this part of the file need not be further examined. The notation “4[0232 0252]” means that the subfile 0232 0252 is waiting to be sorted on bit 4 from the left. In this particular case, no progress occurs when sorting on bit 4; we need to go to bit 5 before the items are separated.  The complete sorting process shown in Table 3 takes 22 stages, somewhat more than the comparable number for quicksort  Table 2 . Similarly, the number of bit inspections, 82, is rather high; but we shall see that the number of bit inspections for large N is actually less than the number of comparisons made by quicksort, assuming a uniform distribution of keys. The total number of exchanges in Table 3 is 17, which is quite reasonable. Note that bit inspections never have to go past bit 7 here, although 10-bit numbers are being sorted.  As in quicksort, we can use a stack to keep track of the “boundary line information” for waiting subfiles. Instead of sorting the smallest subfile first, it is convenient simply to go from left to right, since the stack size in this case can never exceed the number of bits in the keys being sorted. In the following algorithm the stack entry  r, b  is used to indicate the right boundary r of a subfile waiting to be sorted on bit b; the left boundary need not actually be recorded in the stack — it is implicit because of the left-to-right nature of the procedure. Algorithm R  Radix exchange sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete, their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. Each key is assumed to be a nonnegative m-bit binary number,  a1 a2 . . . am 2; the ith most significant bit, ai, is called “bit i” of the key. An auxiliary stack with room for at most m − 1 entries is needed for temporary storage.

The bit-inspection loops can be made somewhat faster, as shown in exercise 34, at the expense of a more complicated program. It is also possible to increase the speed of radix exchange by using straight insertion whenever r − l is sufficiently small, as we did in Algorithm Q; but we shall not dwell on these refinements.  In order to analyze the running time of radix exchange, two kinds of input  data suggest themselves. We can  i  assume that N = 2m and that the keys to be sorted are simply the integers  0, 1, 2, . . . , 2m − 1 in random order; or  ii  assume that m = ∞  unlimited precision  and that the keys to be sorted  are independent uniformly distributed real numbers in [0 . . 1 .  The analysis of case  i  is relatively easy, so it has been left as an exercise for the reader  see exercise 35 . Case  ii  is comparatively difficult, so it has also been left as an exercise  see exercise 38 . The following table shows crude approximations to the results of these analyses:  Quantity  A  B  C  G  K  L  R  S  Case  i   N  1 4 N lg N N lg N 1 2 N 0 0 0 1 2 N 1 2 N  Case  ii  αN 1 4 N lg N N lg N 0 1 2 N 2 α − 1 N 1 2 α − 1 N 1 2 N 1 2 N  1  X   30  Here α = 1 ln 2 ≈ 1.4427. Notice that the average number of exchanges, bit inspections, and stack accesses is essentially the same for both kinds of data, even though case  ii  takes about 44 percent more stages. Our MIX program takes approximately 14.4 N ln N units of time, on the average, to sort N items in case  ii , and this could be cut to about 11.5 N ln N using the suggestion of exercise 34; the corresponding figure for Program Q is 11.7 N ln N, which can be decreased to about 10.6 N ln N using Singleton’s median-of-three suggestion.  Thus radix exchange sorting takes about as long as quicksort, on the average, when sorting uniformly distributed data; on some machines it is actually a little quicker than quicksort. Exercise 53 indicates to what extent the process slows down for a nonuniform distribution. It is important to note that our entire analysis is predicated on the assumption that keys are distinct; radix exchange as defined above is not especially efficient when equal keys are present, since it goes through several time-consuming stages trying to separate sets of identical   128  SORTING  5.2.2  keys before b becomes > m. One plausible way to remedy this defect is suggested in the answer to exercise 40.  Both radix exchange and quicksort are essentially based on the idea of partitioning. Records are exchanged until the file is split into two parts: a left- hand subfile, in which all keys are ≤ K, for some K, and a right-hand subfile in which all keys are ≥ K. Quicksort chooses K to be an actual key in the file, while radix exchange essentially chooses an artificial key K based on binary representations. From a historical standpoint, radix exchange was discovered by P. Hildebrandt, H. Isbitz, H. Rising, and J. Schwartz [JACM 6  1959 , 156–163], about a year earlier than quicksort. Other partitioning schemes are also possible; for example, John McCarthy has suggested setting K ≈ 1 2 u + v , if all keys are known to lie between u and v. Yihsiao Wang has suggested that the mean of three key values such as  28  be used as the threshold for partitioning; he has proved that the number of comparisons required to sort uniformly distributed random data will then be asymptotic to 1.082N lg N.  Still another partitioning strategy has been proposed by M. H. van Emden [CACM 13  1970 , 563–567]: Instead of choosing K in advance, we “learn” what a good K might be, by keeping track of K′ = max Kl, . . . , Ki  and K′′ = min Kj, . . . , Kr  as partitioning proceeds. We may increase i until encountering a key greater than K′, then decrease j until encountering a key less than K′′, then exchange and or adjust K′ and K′′. Empirical tests on this “interval-exchange sort” method indicate that it is slightly slower than quicksort; its running time appears to be so difficult to analyze that an adequate theoretical explanation will never be found, especially since the subfiles after partitioning are no longer in random order.  A generalization of radix exchange to radices higher than 2 is discussed in  Section 5.2.5. *Asymptotic methods. The analysis of exchange sorting algorithms leads to some particularly instructive mathematical problems that enable us to learn more about how to find the asymptotic behavior of functions. For example, we came across the function  Wn = 1 n!    0≤r<s≤n  s! rn−s   31   in  9 , during our analysis of the bubble sort; what is its asymptotic value?  We can proceed as in our study of the number of involutions, Eq. 5.1.4– 41 ; the reader will find it helpful to review the discussion at the end of Section 5.1.4 before reading further. Inspection of  31  shows that the contribution for s = n is larger than that for s = n − 1, etc.; this suggests replacing s by n − s. In fact, we soon discover that it is most convenient to use the substitutions t = n − s + 1, m = n + 1, so that  31  becomes  1 m  Wm−1 = 1 m!     m − t !   1≤t<m  0≤r<m−t  rt−1.   32     33    34   5.2.2  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  129  The inner sum has a well-known asymptotic series obtained from Euler’s sum- mation formula, namely rt−1 = N t t  2!  t − 1  N t−2 − δt2  + ···    0≤r<N  − 1 2  N t−1 − δt1  + B2   t k    m − t !  m − t ttk,  j=0  j  = 1  t  1 m!

But when k = −1 the method breaks down, since f−1 0  is undefined; we can’t merely sum from 1 to m either, because the remainders don’t give smaller and smaller powers of m when the lower limit is 1.  This is the crux of the matter, and the reader should pause to appreciate the problem before proceeding further.    0  + Rp,   j−1    m  − f   j−1   k   130  SORTING  5.2.2 x  To resolve the dilemma we can define g−1 x  =  e−x2 − 1  x and f−1 x  = √ 0≤t<m f−1 t  g−1 in a simple way.

This question turns out to be harder than any of the other asymptotic problems we have met so far; the elementary methods of power series expansions, Euler’s summation formula, etc., turn out to be inadequate. The following derivation has been suggested by N. G. de Bruijn.  To get rid of the cancellation effects of the large factors n Un =  we start by rewriting the sum as an infinite series   −1 k in  38 ,   −1 k   1   n     39   k  j≥1  j = 2j 1 − 2−j n − 2j + n.   = exp−x + x2 O n−1 ,  n − 1 + x  1 − x n    .   2je−n 2j − 2j + n .  k  k≥2  2k−1  j≥1  If we set x = n 2j, the summand is  2j 1 − 2−j n − 2j + n = n x  When x ≤ nϵ, we have    n = exp  1 − x n  1 − x n and this suggests approximating  39  by  n ln    Tn =  j≥1   38    40    41    5.2.2 To justify this approximation, we have Un − Tn = Xn + Yn, where  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  2j 1 − 2−j n − 2je−n 2j  [the terms for x > nϵ]  131  Xn =  =   j≥1  2j <n1−ϵ  j≥1  2j <n1−ϵ  Yn =  =   j≥1 2j≥n1−ϵ  j≥1 2j≥n1−ϵ  and  O ne−n 2j   [since 0 < 1−2−j < e−2−j ]  = O n log n e−nϵ   [since there are O log n  terms];  2j 1 − 2−j n − 2je−n 2j     e−n 2j n  2j O 1   [the terms for x ≤ nϵ]  [by  40 ].   ∞  −∞   1 2+i∞  1 2−i∞  Our discussion below will demonstrate that the latter sum is O 1 ; consequently Un − Tn = O 1 .  See exercise 47.  So far we haven’t applied any techniques that are really different from those we have used before. But the study of Tn requires a new idea, based on simple principles of complex variable theory: If x is any positive number, we have  e−x = 1 2πi  Γ z x−z dz = 1 2π  Γ  1  2 + it x− 1 2+it  dt.   42   .  0≤k<M  0≤k<M  x− −k     lim z→−k  known bound  xk  −1 k k!  To prove this identity, consider the path of integration shown in Fig. 20 a , where N, N′, and M are large. The value of the integral along this contour is the sum of the residues inside, namely  The integral on the top line is O 1 2   z + k Γ z  =  Γ t + iN  x−t dt, and we have the well- Γ t + iN  = Ot + iNt−1 2e−t−πN 2 Oe−πN 2 1 2  N xe t dt.

There- Γ 1  fore as M, N, N′ → ∞, only the right-hand integral survives, and this proves  42 . In fact,  42  remains valid if we replace 1  2 by any positive number.  The same argument can be used to derive many other useful relations involving the gamma function. We can replace x−z by other functions of z; or we can replace the constant 1  2 by other quantities. For example,  −∞  Γ z x−z dz = e−x − 1 + x,  and this is the critical quantity in our formula  41  for Tn:  Tn = n  Γ z  n 2j −1−z dz.   −3 2+i∞  −3 2−i∞  1 2πi   −3 2+i∞  −3 2−i∞  1 2πi    j≥1  The sum may be placed inside the integrals, since its convergence is absolutely well-behaved; we have   1 2w j = nw  2w − 1 ,  when ℜ w  > 0,     n 2j w = nw  j≥1  j≥1  because 2w = 2ℜ w  > 1.

Fixing M and letting N, N′ → ∞ shows that −Tn n is O n−1−M  plus the sum of the residues in the region −3 2 < ℜ z  < M. The factor Γ z  has simple poles at z = −1 and z = 0, while n−1−z has no poles, and 1  2−1−z − 1  has simple poles when z = −1 + 2πik ln 2.  −∞   43    44    45   1  2 +iN−M  1 2 +iN  0  1  2−iN cid:48 −M  1  2−iN cid:48   − 3  2 +iN  M +iN  0  − 3 2−iN cid:48   M−iN cid:48    5.2.2  133 The double pole at z = −1 is the hardest to handle. We can use the well-  SORTING BY EXCHANGING  known relation  Γ z + 1  = exp −γz + ζ 2 z2 2 − ζ 3 z3 3 + ζ 4 z4 4 − ···  ,  where ζ s  = 1−s + 2−s + 3−s + ··· = H when w = z + 1 is small:   s   ∞ , to deduce the following expansions  Γ z  = Γ w + 1   w w − 1  = −w−1 +  γ − 1  + O w ,  n−1−z = 1 − w ln n + O w2 ,  1  2−1−z − 1  = −w−1 ln 2 − 1  2 + O w .  The residue at z = −1 is the coefficient of w−1 in the product of these three 2 −  ln n + γ − 1  ln 2. Adding the other residues gives the formulas, namely 1 formula = ln n + γ − 1 Tn  46  n  + O n−M , for arbitrarily large M, where δ n  is a rather strange function,  − 1 2 + δ n  + 2  ln 2  n  ℜΓ −1 − 2πik  ln 2  exp 2πik lg n .   47   δ n  = 2 ln 2    k≥1  Notice that δ n  = δ 2n . The average value of δ n  is zero, since the average value of each term is zero.  We may assume that  lg n  mod 1 is uniformly distributed, in view of the results about floating point numbers in Section 4.2.4.   Furthermore, since Γ −1 + it  =π  t 1 + t2  sinh πt 1 2, it is not difficult to  show that   48  thus we may safely ignore the “wobbles” of δ n  for practical purposes. For theoretical purposes, however, we can’t obtain a valid asymptotic expansion of Un without it; that is why Un is a comparatively difficult function to analyze.  From the definition of Tn in  41  we can see immediately that  δ n  < 0.000000173;  T2n 2n  = Tn n  + 1 − 1  + e−n n  .  n  Therefore the error term O n−M  in  46  is essential; it cannot be replaced by zero. However, exercise 54 presents another approach to the analysis, which avoids such error terms by deriving a rather peculiar convergent series.  In summary, we have deduced the behavior of the difficult sum  38 :   γ − 1 ln 2 − 1    Un = n lg n + n  2 + δ n   + O 1 .  The gamma-function method we have used to obtain this result is a special case of the general technique of Mellin transforms, which are extremely useful in the study of radix-oriented recurrence relations. Other examples of this approach   49    50    134  SORTING  5.2.2  can be found in exercises 51–53 and in Section 6.3.

See exercise 29.   5.2.3. Sorting by Selection Another important family of sorting techniques is based on the idea of repeated selection. The simplest selection method is perhaps the following:  i  Find the smallest key; transfer the corresponding record to the output area; then replace the key by the value ∞  which is assumed to be higher than any actual key . the smallest key has been replaced by ∞.  ii  Repeat step  i . This time the second smallest key will be selected, since  iii  Continue repeating step  i  until N records have been selected.   5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  139  A selection method requires all of the input items to be present before sorting may proceed, and it generates the final outputs one by one in sequence. This is essentially the opposite of insertion, where the inputs are received sequentially but we do not know any of the final outputs until sorting is completed. Step  i  involves N −1 comparisons each time a new record is selected, and it also requires a separate output area in memory. But we can obviously do better: We can move the selected record into its proper final position, by exchanging it with the record currently occupying that position. Then we need not consider that position again in future selections, and we need not deal with infinite keys. This idea yields our first selection sorting algorithm. Algorithm S  Straight selection sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete, their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. Sorting is based on the method indicated above, except that it proves to be more convenient to select the largest element first, then the second largest, etc. S1.

Jump if Ki ≥ Kk. Otherwise set i ← k, rA ← Ki. k ← k − 1. Repeat if k > 0.  A A B B A A  = 1 2 N N − 1 ,  2  A =   1  regardless of the values of the input keys; hence only B is variable. In spite of the simplicity of straight selection, this quantity B is not easy to analyze precisely. Exercises 3 through 6 show that  B =min 0, ave  N + 1 HN − 2N, max ⌊N 2 4⌋;   2  in this case the maximum value turns out to be particularly interesting. The standard deviation of B is of order N 3 4; see exercise 7. Thus the average running time of Program S is 2.5N 2 + 3 N + 1 HN + 3.5N − 11 units, just slightly slower than straight insertion  Program 5.2.1S . It is interesting to compare Algorithm S to the bubble sort  Algorithm 5.2.2B , since bubble sorting may be regarded as a selection algorithm that sometimes selects more than one element at a time. For this reason bubble sorting usually does fewer comparisons than straight selection and it may seem to be preferable; but in fact Program 5.2.2B is more than twice as slow as Program S! Bubble sorting is handicapped by the fact that it does so many exchanges, while straight selection involves very little data movement. Refinements of straight selection. Is there any way to improve on the selection method used in Algorithm S? For example, take the search for a maximum in step S2; is there a substantially faster way to find a maximum? The answer to the latter question is no!   N     5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  141  Lemma M. Every algorithm for finding the maximum of n elements, based on comparing pairs of elements, must make at least n − 1 comparisons. Proof. If we have made fewer than n − 1 comparisons, there will be at least two elements that have never been found to be less than any others. Therefore we do not know which of these two elements is larger, and we cannot have determined the maximum.  Thus, any selection process that finds the largest element must perform at least n−1 comparisons; and we might suspect that all sorting methods based on n repeated selections are doomed to require Ω n2  operations. But fortunately Lemma M applies only to the first selection step; subsequent selections can make use of previously gained information. For example, exercises 8 and 9 show that a comparatively simple change to Algorithm S will cut the average number of comparisons in half.  Consider the 16 numbers in Table 1; one way to save time on repeated selections is to regard them as four groups of four. We can start by determining the largest in each group, namely the respective keys  the largest of these four elements, 908, is then the largest of the entire file. To get the second largest we need only look at 512, 653, 765, and the other three elements of the group containing 908; the largest of {170, 897, 275} is 897, and the largest of  is 897. Similarly, to get the third largest element we determine the largest of {170, 275} and then the largest of  512, 908, 653, 765;  512, 897, 653, 765  512, 275, 653, 765.  √  √  Each selection after the first takes at most 5 additional comparisons. In general, √ if N is a perfect square, we can divide the file into N groups of N elements √ N − 2 comparisons within each; each selection after the first takes at most √ N − 1 comparisons among the the group of the previously selected item, plus “group leaders.” This idea is called quadratic selection; its total execution time is O N  N  , which is substantially better than order N 2.  N large groups, each containing 3√  Quadratic selection was first published by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 152–154], who pointed out that the same idea can be generalized to cubic, quartic, and higher degrees of selection. For example, cubic selection divides the file into 3√ N small groups, each containing 3√ N records; the execution time is proportional to N N. If we carry this idea to its ultimate conclusion we arrive at what Friend called “nth degree selecting,” based on a binary tree structure. This method has an execution time proportional to N log N; we shall call it tree selection. Tree selection. The principles of tree selection sorting are easy to understand in terms of matches in a typical “knockout tournament.” Consider, for example,  3√   142  SORTING  5.2.3  the results of the ping-pong contest shown in Fig. 22; at the bottom level, Kim beats Sandy and Chris beats Lou, then in the next round Chris beats Kim, etc.  Chris  Chris  Pat  Kim  Chris  Pat  Robin  Kim Sandy Chris Lou Pat Ray Dale Robin  Fig. 22. A ping-pong tournament.  Figure 22 shows that Chris is the champion of the eight players, and 8−1 = 7 matches comparisons were required to determine this fact. Pat is not necessarily the second-best player; any of the people defeated by Chris, including the first- round loser Lou, might possibly be second best. We can determine the second- best player by having Lou play Kim, and the winner of that match plays Pat; only two additional matches are required to find the second-best player, because of the structure we have remembered from the earlier games.  In general, we can “output” the player at the root of the tree, and replay the tournament as if that player had been sick and unable to play a good game. Then the original second-best player will rise to the root; and to recalculate the winners in the upper levels of the tree, only one path must be changed. It follows that fewer than ⌈lg N⌉ further comparisons are needed to select the second-best player. The same procedure will find the third-best, etc.; hence the total time for such a selection sort will be roughly proportional to N log N, as claimed above. Figure 23 shows tree selection sorting in action, on our 16 example numbers. Notice that we need to know where the key at the root came from, in order to know where to insert the next “−∞”. Therefore each branch node of the tree should actually contain a pointer or index specifying the position of the relevant key, instead of the key itself. It follows that we need memory space for N input records, N − 1 pointers, and N output records or pointers to those records.  If the output goes to tape or disk, of course, we don’t need to retain the output records in high-speed memory.   The reader should pause at this point and work exercise 10, because a good understanding of the basic principles of tree selection will make it easier to appreciate the remarkable improvements we are about to discuss.  One way to modify tree selection, essentially introduced by K. E. Iverson [A Programming Language  Wiley, 1962 , 223–227], does away with the need for pointers by “looking ahead” in the following way: When the winner of a match in the bottom level of the tree is moved up, the winning value can be replaced immediately by −∞ at the bottom level; and whenever a winner moves up from one branch to another, we can replace the corresponding value by the one that should eventually move up into the vacated place  namely the larger of the two keys below . Repeating this operation as often as possible converts Fig. 23 a  into Fig. 24.   5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  143   a  Initial configuration.   b  Key 908 is replaced by −∞, and the second highest element moves up to the root.   c  Configuration after 908, 897, 765, 703, 677, 653, and 612 have been output.

The process begins to look less like a ping-pong tournament and more like a corporate system of promotions. The reader should be able to see that this top-down method has the ad- vantage that redundant comparisons of −∞ with −∞ can be avoided.  The bottom-up approach finds −∞ omnipresent in the latter stages of sorting, but the top-down approach can stop modifying the tree during each stage as soon as a −∞ has been stored.   Figures 23 and 24 are complete binary trees with 16 terminal nodes  see Section 2.3.4.5 , and it is convenient to represent such trees in consecutive locations as shown in Fig. 25. Note that the parent of node number k is node ⌊k 2⌋, and its children are nodes 2k and 2k +1. This leads to another advantage of the top-down approach, since it is often considerably simpler to go top-down from node k to nodes 2k and 2k + 1 than bottom-up from node k to nodes k ⊕ 1 and ⌊k 2⌋.  Here k ⊕ 1 stands for k + 1 or k − 1, according as k is even or odd.   Fig. 25. Sequential storage allocation for a complete binary tree.  Our examples of tree selection so far have more or less assumed that N is a power of 2; but actually we can work with arbitrary N, since the complete binary tree with N terminal nodes is readily constructed for any N. Now we come to the crucial question: Can’t we do the top-down method without using −∞ at all? Wouldn’t it be nice if the important information of Fig. 24 were all in locations 1 through 16 of the complete binary tree, without the useless “holes” containing −∞? Some reflection shows that it is indeed possible to achieve this goal, not only eliminating −∞ but also avoiding the need for an auxiliary output area. This line of thinking leads us to an important sorting algorithm that was christened “heapsort” by its discoverer J. W. J. Williams [CACM 7  1964 , 347–348]. Heapsort. Let us say that a file of keys K1, K2, . . . , KN is a heap if  ≥ Kj  K⌊j 2⌋  for 1 ≤ ⌊j 2⌋ < j ≤ N.   3   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31   ≥ Kj  5.2.3 145 Thus, K1 ≥ K2, K1 ≥ K3, K2 ≥ K4, etc.; this is exactly the condition that holds in Fig. 24, and it implies in particular that the largest key appears “on top of the heap,”  SORTING BY SELECTION  K⌊j 2⌋   4  If we can somehow transform an arbitrary input file into a heap, we can sort the elements by using a top-down selection procedure as described above.  K1 = max  K1, K2, . . . , KN .  An efficient approach to heap creation has been suggested by R. W. Floyd [CACM 7  1964 , 701]. Let us assume that we have been able to arrange the file so that  for l < ⌊j 2⌋ < j ≤ N,   5  where l is some number ≥ 1.  In the original file this condition holds vacuously for l = ⌊N 2⌋, since no subscript j satisfies the condition ⌊N 2⌋ < ⌊j 2⌋ < j ≤ N.  It is not difficult to see how to transform the file so that the inequalities in  5  are extended to the case l = ⌊j 2⌋, working entirely in the subtree whose root is node l. Then we can decrease l by 1, until condition  3  is finally achieved. These ideas of Williams and Floyd lead to the following elegant algorithm, which merits careful study: Algorithm H  Heapsort . Records R1, . . . , RN are rearranged in place; after sorting is complete, their keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. First we rearrange the file so that it forms a heap, then we repeatedly remove the top of the heap and transfer it to its proper final position. Assume that N ≥ 2. H1. [Initialize.] Set l ← ⌊N 2⌋ + 1, r ← N. H2. [Decrease l or r.] If l > 1, set l ← l − 1, R ← Rl, K ← Kl.  If l > 1, we are in the process of transforming the input file into a heap; on the other hand if l = 1, the keys K1 K2 . . . Kr presently constitute a heap.  Otherwise set R ← Rr, K ← Kr, Rr ← R1, and r ← r − 1; if this makes r = 1, set R1 ← R and terminate the algorithm.  H3. [Prepare for siftup.] Set j ← l.  At this point we have  ≥ Kk  K⌊k 2⌋   6  and record Rk is in its final position for r < k ≤ N. Steps H3–H8 are called the siftup algorithm; their effect is equivalent to setting Rl ← R and then rearranging Rl, . . . , Rr so that condition  6  holds also for l = ⌊k 2⌋.   for l < ⌊k 2⌋ < k ≤ r;  H4. [Advance downward.] Set i ← j and j ← 2j.  In the following steps we have i = ⌊j 2⌋.  If j < r, go right on to step H5; if j = r, go to step H6; and if j > r, go to H8.  H5. [Find larger child.] If Kj < Kj+1, then set j ← j + 1. H6. [Larger than K?] If K ≥ Kj, then go to step H8. H7. [Move it up.] Set Ri ← Rj, and go back to step H4. H8. [Store R.] Set Ri ← R.  This terminates the siftup algorithm initiated in  step H3.  Return to step H2.   146  SORTING  5.2.3  Fig. 26.

N − 1 N − 1 N − 1 N − 1 N − 1  1  Although this program is only about twice as long as Program S, it is much  more efficient when N is large. Its running time depends on  P = N + ⌊N 2⌋ − 2, the number of siftup passes; A, the number of siftup passes in which the key K finally lands  in an interior node of the heap;  B, the total number of keys promoted during siftups; C, the number of times j ← j + 1 in step H5; and D, the number of times j = r in step H4.   148  SORTING  5.2.3   7   These quantities are analyzed below; in practice they show comparatively little fluctuation about their average values,  A ≈ 0.349N, C ≈ 1  2 N lg N − 0.94N,  B ≈ N lg N − 1.87N, D ≈ lg N.  For example, when N = 1000, four experiments on random input gave, respec- tively, A = 371, 351, 341, 340; B = 8055, 8072, 8094, 8108; C = 4056, 4087, 4017, 4083; and D = 12, 14, 8, 13. The total running time,  7A + 14B + 4C + 20N − 2D + 15⌊N 2⌋ − 28,  is therefore approximately 16N lg N + 0.01N units on the average.  A glance at Table 2 makes it hard to believe that heapsort is very efficient; large keys migrate to the left before we stash them at the right! It is indeed a strange way to sort, when N is small; the sorting time for the 16 keys in Table 2 is 1068u, while the simple method of straight insertion  Program 5.2.1S  takes only 514u. Straight selection  Program S  takes 853u.  For larger N, Program H is more efficient.  It invites comparison with shellsort  Program 5.2.1D  and quicksort  Program 5.2.2Q , since all three pro- grams sort by comparisons of keys and use little or no auxiliary storage. When N = 1000, the approximate average running times on MIX are  160000u for heapsort, 130000u for shellsort, 80000u for quicksort.   MIX is a typical computer, but particular machines will of course yield somewhat different relative values.  As N gets larger, heapsort will be superior to shell- sort, but its asymptotic running time 16N lg N ≈ 23.08N ln N will never beat quicksort’s 11.67N ln N. A modification of heapsort discussed in exercise 18 will speed up the process by substantially reducing the number of comparisons, but even this improvement falls short of quicksort.  On the other hand, quicksort is efficient only on the average, and its worst case is of order N 2. Heapsort has the interesting property that its worst case isn’t much worse than the average: We always have  A ≤ 1.5N,  C ≤ N⌊lg N⌋,  B ≤ N⌊lg N⌋,   8  so Program H will take no more than 18N⌊lg N⌋ + 38N units of time, regardless of the distribution of the input data. Heapsort is the first sorting method we have seen that is guaranteed to be of order N log N. Merge sorting, discussed in Section 5.2.4 below, also has this property, but it requires more memory space. Largest in, first out. We have seen in Chapter 2 that linear lists can often be classified in a meaningful way by the nature of the insertion and deletion oper- ations that make them grow and shrink. A stack has last-in-first-out behavior, in the sense that every deletion removes the youngest item in the list — the item that was inserted most recently of all items currently present. A simple queue   5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  149  has first-in-first-out behavior, in the sense that every deletion removes the oldest remaining item. In more complex situations, such as the elevator simulation of Section 2.2.5, we want a smallest-in-first-out list, where every deletion removes the item having the smallest key. Such a list may be called a priority queue, since the key of each item reflects its relative ability to get out of the list quickly. Selection sorting is a special case of a priority queue in which we do N insertions followed by N deletions.  Priority queues arise in a wide variety of applications. For example, some numerical iterative schemes are based on repeated selection of an item having the largest  or smallest  value of some test criterion; parameters of the selected item are changed, and it is reinserted into the list with a new test value, based on the new values of its parameters. Operating systems often make use of priority queues for the scheduling of jobs. Exercises 15, 29, and 36 mention other typical applications of priority queues, and many other examples will appear in later chapters.  How shall we implement priority queues? One of the obvious methods is to maintain a sorted list, containing the items in order of their keys. Inserting a new item is then essentially the same problem we have treated in our study of insertion sorting, Section 5.2.1. Another even more obvious way to deal with priority queues is to keep the list of elements in arbitrary order, selecting the appropriate element each time a deletion is required by finding the largest  or smallest  key. The trouble with both of these obvious approaches is that they require Ω N  steps either for insertion or deletion, when there are N entries in the list, so they are very time-consuming when N is large.  In his original paper on heapsorting, Williams pointed out that heaps are ideally suited to large priority queue applications, since we can insert or delete elements from a heap in O log N  steps; furthermore, all elements of the heap are compactly located in consecutive memory locations. The selection phase of Algorithm H is a sequence of deletion steps of a largest-in-first-out process: To delete the largest element K1 we remove it and sift KN up into a new heap of N − 1 elements.  If we want a smallest-in-first-out algorithm, as in the elevator simulation, we can obviously change the definition of heap so that “≥” becomes “≤” in  3 ; for convenience, we shall consider only the largest-in-first-out case here.  In general, if we want to delete the largest item and then insert a new element x, we can do the siftup procedure with and  K = x.  r = N,  l = 1,  If we wish to insert an element x without a prior deletion, we can use the bottom- up procedure of exercise 16. A linked representation for priority queues. An efficient way to represent priority queues as linked binary trees was discovered in 1971 by Clark A. Crane [Technical Report STAN-CS-72-259  Computer Science Department, Stanford University, 1972 ]. His method requires two link fields and a small count in every record, but it has the following advantages over a heap:   150  SORTING  5.2.3  i  When the priority queue is being treated as a stack, the insertion and  deletion operations take a fixed time independent of the queue size. ii  The records never move, only the pointers change. iii  Two disjoint priority queues, having a total of N elements, can easily be merged into a single priority queue, in only O log N  steps.  Crane’s original method, slightly modified, is illustrated in Fig. 27, which shows a special kind of binary tree structure. Each node contains a KEY field, a DIST field, and two link fields LEFT and RIGHT. The DIST field is always set to the length of a shortest path from that node to the null link Λ; in other words, it is the distance from that node to the nearest empty subtree. If we define DIST Λ  = 0 and KEY Λ  = −∞, the KEY and DIST fields in the tree satisfy the following properties:  DIST LEFT P   ≥ DIST RIGHT P  .  KEY P  ≥ KEY LEFT P  , KEY P  ≥ KEY RIGHT P  ; DIST P  = 1 + min DIST LEFT P  , DIST RIGHT P   ;   9   10   11  Relation  9  is analogous to the heap condition  3 ; it guarantees that the root of the tree has the largest key. Relation  10  is just the definition of the DIST fields as stated above. Relation  11  is the interesting innovation: It implies that a shortest path to Λ may always be obtained by moving to the right. We shall say that a binary tree with this property is a leftist tree, because it tends to lean so heavily to the left.  It is clear from these definitions that DIST P  = n implies the existence of at least 2n empty subtrees below P; otherwise there would be a shorter path from P to Λ. Thus, if there are N nodes in a leftist tree, the path leading downward from the root towards the right contains at most ⌊lg N + 1 ⌋ nodes. It is possible to insert a new node into the priority queue by traversing this path  see exercise 33 ; hence only O log N  steps are needed in the worst case. The best case occurs when the tree is linear  all RIGHT links are Λ , and the worst case occurs when the tree is perfectly balanced.  To remove the node at the root, we simply need to merge its two subtrees. The operation of merging two disjoint leftist trees, pointed to respectively by P and Q, is conceptually simple: If KEY P  ≥ KEY Q  we take P as the root and merge Q with P’s right subtree; then DIST P  is updated, and LEFT P  is interchanged with RIGHT P  if necessary. A detailed description of this process is not difficult to devise  see exercise 33 . Comparison of priority queue techniques. When the number of nodes, N, is small, it is best to use one of the straightforward linear list methods to maintain a priority queue; but when N is large, a log N method using heaps or leftist trees is obviously much faster. In Section 6.2.3 we shall discuss the representation of linear lists as balanced trees, and this leads to a third log N method suitable for priority queue implementation. It is therefore appropriate to compare these three techniques.   5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  151  Fig. 27. A priority queue represented as a leftist tree.  We have seen that leftist tree operations tend to be slightly faster than heap operations, although heaps consume less memory space because they have no link fields. Balanced trees take about the same space as leftist trees, perhaps slightly less; the operations are slower than heaps, and the programming is more complicated, but the balanced tree structure is considerably more flexible in several ways. When using a heap or a leftist tree we cannot predict very easily what will happen to two items with equal keys; it is impossible to guarantee that items with equal keys will be treated in a last-in-first-out or first-in-first- out manner, unless the key is extended to include an additional “serial number of insertion” field so that no equal keys are really present. With balanced trees, on the other hand, we can easily stipulate consistent conventions about equal keys, and we can also do things such as “insert x immediately before  or after  y.” Balanced trees are symmetrical, so that we can delete either the largest or the smallest element at any time, while heaps and leftist trees must be oriented one way or the other.  See exercise 31, however, which shows how to construct symmetrical heaps.  Balanced trees can be used for searching as well as for sorting; and we can rather quickly remove consecutive blocks of elements from a balanced tree. But Ω N  steps are needed in general to merge two balanced trees, while leftist trees can be merged in only O log N  steps.  In summary, heaps use minimum memory; leftist trees are great for merging if  disjoint priority queues; and the flexibility of balanced trees is available, necessary, at reasonable cost.  908 3  897 3  512 2  653 2  765 2  503 1  061 1  275 1  426 1  677 1  703 1  087 1  612 1  509 1  170 1  154 1  Node format DIST RIGHT  KEY LEFT   152  SORTING  5.2.3  SICOMP 7  1978 , 298–319];  Many new ways to represent priority queues have been discovered since the pioneering work of Williams and Crane discussed above. Programmers now have a large menu of options to ponder, besides simple lists, heaps, leftist or balanced trees:   stratified trees, which provide symmetrical priority queue operations in only O log log M  steps when all keys lie in a given range 0 ≤ K < M [P. van Emde Boas, R.

Algorithm H is rather complicated, so it probably will never submit to a complete mathematical analysis; but several of its properties can be deduced without great difficulty. Therefore we shall conclude this section by studying the anatomy of a heap in some detail.  Figure 28 shows the shape of a heap with 26 elements; each node has been labeled in binary notation corresponding to its subscript in the heap. Asterisks in this diagram denote the special nodes, those that lie on the path from 1 to N. One of the most important attributes of a heap is the collection of its subtree sizes. For example, in Fig. 28 the sizes of the subtrees rooted at 1, 2, . . . , 26 are, respectively,  26∗, 15, 10∗, 7, 7, 6∗, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2∗, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1∗.   12  Asterisks denote special subtrees, rooted at the special nodes; exercise 20 shows that if the binary representation of N is  N =  bnbn−1 . . . b1b0 2,  n = ⌊lg N⌋,   13    5.2.3  SORTING BY SELECTION  153  Fig. 28. A heap of 26 =  11010 2 elements looks like this.  then the special subtree sizes are always   1bn−1 . . . b1b0 2,  1bn−2 . . . b1b0 2, . . . ,  1b1b0 2,  1b0 2,  1 2.   14  Nonspecial subtrees are always perfectly balanced, so their size is always of the form 2k − 1. Exercise 21 shows that the nonspecial sizes consist of exactly   N − 1    2  1s,   N − 2    4  3s,   N − 4    8   N − 2n−1    2n  7s,  . . . ,   2n − 1 s.   15   For example, Fig. 28 contains twelve nonspecial subtrees of size 1, six of size 3, two of size 7, and one of size 15. Let sl be the size of the subtree whose root is l, and let MN be the multiset {s1, s2, . . . , sN} of all these sizes. We can calculate MN easily for any given N by using  14  and  15 . Exercise 5.1.4–20 tells us that the total number of ways to arrange the integers {1, 2, . . . , N} into a heap is  N! s1s2 . . . sN = N!   16  For example, the number of ways to place the 26 letters {A, B, C, . . . , Z} into Fig. 28 so that vertical lines preserve alphabetic order is  {s  s ∈ MN}.  26!  26 · 10 · 6 · 2 · 1 · 112 · 36 · 72 · 151 .  We are now in a position to analyze the heap-creation phase of Algorithm H, namely the computations that take place before the condition l = 1 occurs for the first time in step H2. Fortunately we can reduce the study of heap creation to the study of independent siftup operations, because of the following theorem. Theorem H. If Algorithm H is applied to a random permutation of {1,2, . . . , N}, heap-creation phase. Moreover, each of the ⌊N 2⌋ siftup operations performed during this phase is uniform, in the sense that each of the sl possible values of i is equally likely when step H8 is reached.  each of the N!{s  s ∈ MN} possible heaps is an equally likely outcome of the  1  *  10  11  *  100  101  110  *  111  1000  1001  1010  1011  1100  1101  *  1110  1111  10000 10001 10010 10011 10100 10101 10110 10111 11000 11001 11010  *   154  SORTING  5.2.3  Proof. We can apply what numerical analysts might call a “backwards analysis”; given a possible result K1 . . . KN of the siftup operation rooted at l, we see that there are exactly sl prior configurations K′1 . . . K′N of the file that will sift up to that result. Each of these prior configurations has a different value of K′l; hence, working backwards, there are exactly sl sl+1 . . . sN input permutations of {1, 2, . . . , N} that yield the configuration K1 . . . KN after the siftup at position l has been completed. The case l = 1 is typical: Let K1 . . . KN be a heap, and let K′1 . . . K′N be a file that is transformed by siftup into K1 . . . KN when l = 1, K = K′1. If K = Ki, we must have K′i = K⌊i 2⌋, K′ , etc., while K′j = Kj for all j not on the path from 1 to i. Conversely, for each i this construction yields a file K′1 . . . K′N such that  a  siftup transforms K′1 . . . K′N into K1 . . . KN, ≥ Kj for 2 ≤ ⌊j 2⌋ < j ≤ N. Therefore exactly N such files and  b  K⌊j 2⌋ K′1 . . . K′N are possible, and the siftup operation is uniform.  An example of the proof of this theorem appears in exercise 22.   = K⌊i 4⌋  ⌊i 2⌋  s  Referring to the quantities A, B, C, D in the analysis of Program H, we can see that a uniform siftup operation on a subtree of size s contributes ⌊s 2⌋ s to the average value of A; it contributes 1  0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + ··· + ⌊lg s⌋  = 1 s to the average value of B  see exercise 1.2.4–42 ; and it contributes either 2 s or 0 to the average value of D, according as s is even or odd. The corresponding contribution to C is somewhat more difficult to determine, so it has been left to the reader  see exercise 26 . Summing over all siftups, we find that the average value of A during heap creation is   s + 1 ⌊lg s⌋ − 2⌊lg s⌋+1 + 2  ⌊lg k⌋ = 1  k=1  s  s  A′N ={⌊s 2⌋ s  s ∈ MN},   17  and similar formulas hold for B, C, and D. It is therefore possible to compute these average values exactly without great difficulty, and the following table shows typical results:  N 99 100 999 1000 9999 10000 10001 10002  A′N 19.18 19.93 196.16 196.94 1966.02 1966.82 1966.45 1967.15  B′N 68.35 69.39 734.66 735.80 7428.18 7429.39 7430.07 7430.97  C′N 42.95 42.71 464.53 464.16 4695.54 4695.06 4695.84 4695.95  D′N 0.00 1.84 0.00 1.92 0.00 1.97 0.00 1.73  Asymptotically speaking, we may ignore the special subtree sizes in MN, and we find for example that 4 · 1 A′N = N  7 + ··· + O log N  =1 − 1 8 · 3  2 αN + O log N ,  18   1 + N  3 + N  2 · 0   SORTING BY SELECTION  155  5.2.3  where  α =  k≥1  1 2k−1 = 1.60669 51524 15291 76378 33015 23190 92458 04806−.   19    This value was first computed to high precision by J. W. Wrench, Jr., using the series transformation of exercise 27. Paul Erdős has proved that α is irrational [J. Indian Math. Soc. 12  1948 , 63–66], and Peter Borwein has demonstrated the irrationality of many similar constants [Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 112  1992 , 141–146].  For large N, we may use the approximate formulas  The minimum and maximum values are also readily determined. Only O N  steps are needed to create the heap  see exercise 23 .  This theory nicely explains the heap-creation phase of Algorithm H. But the selection phase is another story, which remains to be written! Let A′′N, B′′N, C′′N, and D′′N denote the average values of A, B, C, and D during the selection phase when N elements are being heapsorted. The behavior of Algorithm H on random input is subject to comparatively little fluctuation about the empirically determined average values  A′N ≈ 0.1967N +  −1 N0.3; B′N ≈ 0.74403N − 1.3 ln N; C′N ≈ 0.47034N − 0.8 ln N; D′N ≈  1.8 ± 0.2 [N even].  A′′N ≈ 0.152N; B′′N ≈ N lg N − 2.61N; C′′N ≈ 1 2 N lg N − 1.41N; D′′N ≈ lg N ± 2;   20    21   4 N lg N.  but no adequate theoretical explanation for the behavior of D′′N or for the conjectured constants 0.152, 2.61, or 1.41 has yet been found. The leading terms of B′′N and C′′N have, however, been established in an elegant manner by R. Schaffer and R. Sedgewick; see exercise 30. Schaffer has also proved that the minimum and maximum possible values of C′′N are respectively asymptotic to 4 N lg N and 3 1 EXERCISES 1.

Prove that this process never requires changing more than O log N  of the DIST fields, if there are N nodes in the tree, even though the tree may contain very long upward paths. 36.

[M21] Find a simple recurrence relation for the multiset MN of subtree sizes in a heap or in a complete binary tree with N internal nodes.  5.2.4. Sorting by Merging Merging  or collating  means the combination of two or more ordered files into a single ordered file. For example, we can merge the two files 503 703 765 and 087 512 677 to obtain 087 503 512 677 703 765. A simple way to accomplish this is to compare the two smallest items, output the smallest, and then repeat the same process. Starting with  we obtain  then  and  087 512 677   503 703 765  503 703 765  703 765  703 765  512 677  512 677  677  087  087 503  087 503 512  and so on. Some care is necessary when one of the two files becomes exhausted; a detailed description of the process appears in the following algorithm: Algorithm M  Two-way merge . This algorithm merges nonempty ordered files x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ··· ≤ xm and y1 ≤ y2 ≤ ··· ≤ yn into a single file z1 ≤ z2 ≤ ··· ≤ zm+n. M1. [Initialize.] Set i ← 1, j ← 1, k ← 1. M2.

We shall see in Section 5.3.2 that this straightforward procedure is essentially the best possible way to merge on a conventional computer, when m ≈ n.  On the other hand, when m is much smaller than n, it is possible to devise more efficient merging algorithms, although they are rather complicated in general.  Algorithm M could be made slightly simpler without much loss of efficiency by placing sentinel elements xm+1 = yn+1 = ∞ at the end of the input files, stopping just before ∞ is output. For an analysis of Algorithm M, see exercise 2. The total amount of work involved in Algorithm M is essentially propor- tional to m + n, so it is clear that merging is a simpler problem than sorting. Furthermore, we can reduce the problem of sorting to merging, because we can repeatedly merge longer and longer subfiles until everything is in sort. We may consider this to be an extension of the idea of insertion sorting: Inserting a new element into a sorted file is the special case n = 1 of merging. If we want to speed up the insertion process we can consider inserting several elements at a time, “batching” them, and this leads naturally to the general idea of merge sorting. From a historical point of view, merge sorting was one of the very first methods proposed for computer sorting; it was suggested by John von Neumann as early as 1945  see Section 5.5 .  We shall study merging in considerable detail in Section 5.4, with regard to external sorting algorithms; our main concern in the present section is the somewhat simpler question of merge sorting within a high-speed random-access memory.  Table 1 shows a merge sort that “burns the candle at both ends” in a manner similar to the scanning procedure we have used in quicksort and radix exchange: We examine the input from the left and from the right, working towards the  M1.

Ignoring the top line of the table for a moment, let us consider the transformation from line 2 to line 3. At the left we have the ascending run 503 703 765; at the right, reading leftwards, we have the run 087 512 677. Merging these two sequences leads to 087 503 512 677 703 765, which is placed at the left of line 3. Then the keys 061 612 908 in line 2 are merged with 170 509 897, and the result  061 170 509 612 897 908  is recorded at the right end of line 3. Finally, 154 275 426 653 is merged with 653 — discovering the overlap before it causes any harm — and the result is placed at the left, following the previous run. Line 2 of the table was formed in the same way from the original input in line 1.

They are the so-called stepdowns, where a smaller element follows a larger one in the direction of reading. We generally encounter an ambiguous situation in the middle of the file, when we read the same key from both directions; this causes no problem if we are a little bit careful as in the following algorithm. The method is traditionally called a “natural” merge because it makes use of the runs that occur naturally in its input. Algorithm N  Natural two-way merge sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are sorted using two areas of memory, each of which is capable of holding N records. For convenience, we shall say that the records of the second area are RN+1, . . . , R2N, although it is not really necessary that RN+1 be adjacent to RN. The initial contents of RN+1, . . . , R2N are immaterial. After sorting is complete, the keys will be in order, K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. N1. [Initialize.] Set s ← 0.  When s = 0, we will be transferring records from the  R1, . . . , RN  area to the  RN+1, . . . , R2N  area; when s = 1, we will be going the other way.   N2. [Prepare for pass.] If s = 0, set i ← 1, j ← N, k ← N + 1, l ← 2N; if s = 1, set i ← N + 1, j ← 2N, k ← 1, l ← N.  Variables i, j, k, l point to the current positions in the “source files” being read and the “destination files” being written.  Set d ← 1, f ← 1.  Variable d gives the current direction of output; f is set to zero if future passes are necessary.   N3. [Compare Ki : Kj.] If Ki > Kj, go to step N8.

This last copying operation is unnecessary if it is acceptable to have the output in  RN+1, . . . , R2N  about half of the time.   This algorithm contains one tricky feature that is explained in exercise 5.  It would not be difficult to program Algorithm N for MIX, but we can deduce the essential facts of its behavior without constructing the entire program. The number of ascending runs in the input will be about 1 2 N, under random conditions, since we have Ki > Ki+1 with probability 1 2; detailed information about the number of runs, under slightly different hypotheses, has been derived  step N3.

Each pass cuts the number of runs in half  except in unusual cases such as the situation in exercise 6 . So the number of passes will usually be 2 N = lg N −1. Each pass requires us to transmit each of the N records, about lg 1 and by exercise 2 most of the time is spent in steps N3, N4, N5, N8, N9. We can sketch the time in the inner loop as follows, if we assume that there is low probability of equal keys:  Step N3   N4  N8  N5  N9  Either  Or  Operations CMPA, JG, JE STA, INC INC, LDA, CMPA, JGE STX, INC DEC, LDX, CMPX, JGE  Time 3.5u 3u 6u 3u 6u  Thus about 12.5u is spent on each record in each pass, and the total running time will be asymptotically 12.5N lg N, for both the average case and the worst case. This is slower than quicksort’s average time, and it may not be enough better than heapsort to justify taking twice as much memory space, since the asymptotic running time of Program 5.2.3H is never more than 18N lg N.  The boundary lines between runs are determined in Algorithm N entirely by stepdowns. This has the possible advantage that input files with a preponderance of increasing order can be handled very quickly, and so can input files with a preponderance of decreasing order; but it slows down the main loop of the calculation. Instead of testing stepdowns, we can determine the length of runs artificially, by saying that all runs in the input have length 1, all runs after the first pass  except possibly the last run  have length 2, . . . , all runs after k passes  except possibly the last run  have length 2k. This is called a straight two-merge, as opposed to the “natural” merge in Algorithm N.  Straight two-way merging is very similar to Algorithm N, and it has essen- tially the same flow chart; but things are sufficiently different that we had better write down the whole algorithm again: Algorithm S  Straight two-way merge sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are sorted using two memory areas as in Algorithm N. S1. [Initialize.] Set s ← 0, p ← 1.  For the significance of variables s, i, j, k, l, and d, see Algorithm N. Here p represents the size of ascending runs to be merged on the current pass; further variables q and r will keep track of the number of unmerged items in a run.   S2.

If p < N, set s ← 1 − s and return to S2.  Otherwise sorting is complete; if s = 0, set   R1, . . . , RN  ←  RN+1, . . . , R2N .   The latter copying operation will be done if and only if ⌈lg N⌉ is odd, or in the trivial case N = 1, regardless of the distribution of the input. Therefore it is possible to predict the location of the sorted output in advance, and copying will usually be unnecessary.  An example of this algorithm appears in Table 2. It is somewhat amazing that the method works properly when N is not a power of 2; the runs being merged are not all of length 2k, yet no provision has apparently been made for the exceptions!  See exercise 8.  The former tests for stepdowns have been replaced by decrementing q or r and testing the result for zero; this reduces the asymptotic MIX running time to 11N lg N units, slightly faster than we were able to achieve with Algorithm N.  In practice it would be worthwhile to combine Algorithm S with straight insertion; we can sort groups of, say, 16 items using straight insertion, in place of the first four passes of Algorithm S, thereby avoiding the comparatively wasteful bookkeeping operations involved in short merges. As we saw with quicksort, such a combination of methods does not affect the asymptotic running time, but it gives us a reasonable improvement nevertheless.  Let us now study Algorithms N and S from the standpoint of data structures. Why did we need 2N record locations instead of N? The reason is comparatively simple: We were dealing with four lists of varying size  two source lists and two destination lists on each pass ; and we were using the standard “growing   164  SORTING  5.2.4  together” idea discussed in Section 2.2.2, for each pair of sequentially allocated lists. But half of the memory space was always unused, and a little reflection shows that we could really make use of a linked allocation for the four lists. If we add one link field to each of the N records, we can do everything required by the merging algorithms using simple link manipulations, without moving the records at all! Adding N link fields is generally better than adding the space needed for N more records, and the reduced record movement may also save us time, unless our computer memory is especially good at sequential reading and writing. Therefore we ought to consider also a merging algorithm like the following one: Algorithm L  List merge sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are assumed to contain keys K1, . . . , KN, together with link fields L1, . . . , LN capable of holding the numbers − N + 1  through  N + 1 . There are two auxiliary link fields L0 and LN+1 in artificial records R0 and RN+1 at the beginning and end of the file. This algorithm is a “list sort” that sets the link fields so that the records are linked together in ascending order. After sorting is complete, L0 will be the index of the record with the smallest key; and Lk, for 1 ≤ k ≤ N, will be the index of the record that follows Rk, or Lk = 0 if Rk is the record with the largest key.  See Eq. 5.2.1– 13 .   During the course of this algorithm, R0 and RN+1 serve as list heads for two linear lists whose sublists are being merged. A negative link denotes the end of a sublist known to be ordered; a zero link denotes the end of the entire list. We assume that N ≥ 2. The notation “Ls ← p” means “Set Ls to p or −p, retaining the previous sign of Ls.” This operation is well-suited to MIX, but unfortunately not to most computers; it is possible to modify the algorithm in straightforward ways to obtain an equally efficient method for most other machines. L1. [Prepare two lists.] Set L0 ← 1, LN+1 ← 2, Li ← − i+2  for 1 ≤ i ≤ N −2, and LN−1 ← LN ← 0.  We have created two lists containing R1, R3, R5, . . . and R2, R4, R6, . . . , respectively; the negative links indicate that each or- dered sublist consists of one element only. For another way to do this step, taking advantage of ordering that may be present in the initial data, see exercise 12.   L2. [Begin new pass.] Set s ← 0, t ← N + 1, p ← Ls, q ← Lt. If q = 0, the algorithm terminates.  During each pass, p and q traverse the lists being merged; s usually points to the most recently processed record of the current sublist, while t points to the end of the previously output sublist.   L3. [Compare Kp : Kq.] If Kp > Kq, go to L6. L4. [Advance p.] Set Ls ← p, s ← p, p ← Lp. If p > 0, return to L3. L5. [Complete the sublist.] Set Ls ← q, s ← t. Then set t ← q and q ← Lq, one L6. [Advance q.]  Steps L6 and L7 are dual to L4 and L5.  Set Ls ← q, s ← q,  or more times, until q ≤ 0. Finally go to L8.  q ← Lq. If q > 0, return to L3.   5.2.4  SORTING BY MERGING  165  Table 3  LIST MERGE SORTING 10 5  7  8  9  j  0  1  2  3  4  6  14  15  16  11  13  12  0 0 0 0 7  3 −10 2 −13 0 2 2 0  1 −8 1 −11 7 6 11 13  1 −3 −4 −5 −6 −7 −8 −9 −10 −11 −12 −13 −14 −15 −16 0 2 −6 4 16 3 16 3 4 4 12 16  17 Kj − 503 087 512 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 154 509 612 677 765 703 − 2 Lj 4 Lj 6 Lj 11 Lj 0 Lj L7.

A railway network with five “stacks.”  18. [40]  M. A. Kronrod.  Given a file of N records containing only two runs,  K1 ≤ ··· ≤ KM  and  KM+1 ≤ ··· ≤ KN ,  is it possible to sort the file with O N  operations in a random-access memory, using only a small fixed amount of additional memory space regardless of the sizes of M and N?  All of the merging algorithms described in this section make use of extra memory space proportional to N.  19. [26] Consider a railway switching network with n “stacks,” as shown in Fig. 31 when n = 5; we considered one-stack networks in exercises 2.2.1–2 through 2.2.1–5. If N railroad cars enter at the right, we observed that only comparatively few of the N! permutations of those cars could appear at the left, in the one-stack case.  In the n-stack network, assume that 2n cars enter at the right. Prove that each of the 2n! possible permutations of these cars is achievable at the left, by a suitable sequence of operations.  Each stack is actually much bigger than indicated in the illustration — big enough to accommodate all the cars, if necessary.  20. [47] In the notation of exercise 2.2.1–4, at most a n N permutations of N elements can be produced with an n-stack railway network; hence the number of stacks needed to obtain all N! permutations is at least log N! log aN ≈ log4 N. Exercise 19 shows that at most ⌈lg N⌉ stacks are needed. What is the true rate of growth of the necessary number of stacks, as N → ∞? 21. [23]  A. J. Smith.  Explain how to extend Algorithm L so that, in addition to sorting, it computes the number of inversions present in the input permutation. 22. [28]  J. K. R. Barnett.  Develop a way to speed up merge sorting on multiword keys.  Exercise 5.2.2–30 considers the analogous problem for quicksort.  23. [M30] Exercises 13 and 14 analyze a “bottom-up” or iterative version of merge sort, where the cost c N  of sorting N items satisfies the recurrence  c N  = c 2k  + c N − 2k  + f 2k, N − 2k   for 2k < N ≤ 2k+1  and f m, n  is the cost of merging m things with n. Study the “top-down” or divide- and-conquer recurrence  c N  = c ⌈N 2⌉  + c ⌊N 2⌋  + f ⌈N 2⌉, ⌊N 2⌋   for N > 1,  which arises when merge sort is programmed recursively.  5.2.5. Sorting by Distribution We come now to an interesting class of sorting methods that are essentially the exact opposite of merging, when considered from a standpoint we shall discuss   5.2.5  SORTING BY DISTRIBUTION  169  in Section 5.4.7. These methods were used to sort punched cards for many years, long before electronic computers existed. The same approach can be adapted to computer programming, and it is generally known as “bucket sorting,” “radix sorting,” or “digital sorting,” because it is based on the digits of the keys.  Suppose we want to sort a 52-card deck of playing cards. We may define  A < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K,  as an ordering of the face values, and for the suits we may define  ♣ < ♢ < ♡ < ♠.  One card is to precede another if either  i  its suit is less than the other suit, or  ii  its suit equals the other suit but its face value is less.  This is a particular case of lexicographic ordering between ordered pairs of objects; see exercise 5–2.  Thus  A♣ < 2♣ < ··· < K♣ < A♢ < ··· < Q♠ < K♠.  We could sort the cards by any of the methods already discussed. Card players often use a technique somewhat analogous to the idea behind radix exchange: First they divide the cards into four piles, according to suit, then they fiddle with each individual pile until everything is in order.  But there is a faster way to do the trick! First deal the cards face up into 13 piles, one for each face value. Then collect these piles by putting the aces on the bottom, the 2s face up on top of them, then the 3s, etc., finally putting the kings  face up  on top. Turn the deck face down and deal again, this time into four piles for the four suits.  Again you turn the cards face up as you deal them.  By putting the resulting piles together, with clubs on the bottom, then diamonds, hearts, and spades, you’ll get the deck in perfect order.  The same idea applies to the sorting of numbers and alphabetic data. Why does it work? Because  in our playing card example  if two cards go into different piles in the final deal, they have different suits, so the one with the lower suit is lowest. But if two cards have the same suit  and consequently go into the same pile , they are already in proper order because of the previous sorting. In other words, the face values will be in increasing order, on each of the four piles, as we deal the cards on the second pass. The same proof can be abstracted to show that any lexicographic ordering can be sorted in this way; for details, see the answer to exercise 5–2, at the beginning of this chapter.  The sorting method just described is not immediately obvious, and it isn’t clear who first discovered the fact that it works so conveniently. A 19-page pamphlet entitled “The Inventory Simplified,” published by the Tabulating Ma- chines Company division of IBM in 1923, presented an interesting Digit Plan method for forming sums of products on their Electric Sorting Machine: Suppose, for example, that we want to multiply the number punched in columns 1–10 by the number punched in columns 23–25, and to sum all of these products for a large number of cards. We can sort first on column 25, then use the Tabulating Machine to find the quantities a1, a2, . . . , a9, where ak is the total   170  SORTING  5.2.5  of columns 1–10 summed over all cards having k in column 25. Then we can sort on column 24, finding the analogous totals b1, b2, . . . , b9; also on column 23, obtaining c1, c2, . . . , c9. The desired sum of products is easily seen to be a1 + 2a2 + ··· + 9a9 + 10b1 + 20b2 + ··· + 90b9 + 100c1 + 200c2 + ··· + 900c9. This punched-card tabulating method leads naturally to the discovery of least- significant-digit-first radix sorting, so it probably became known to the machine operators. The first published reference to this principle for sorting appears in L. J. Comrie’s early discussion of punched-card equipment [Transactions of the Office Machinery Users’ Assoc., Ltd.  1929 , 25–37, especially page 28].  In order to handle radix sorting inside a computer, we must decide what to do with the piles. Suppose that there are M piles; we could set aside M areas of memory, moving each record from an input area into its appropriate pile area. But this is unsatisfactory, since each area must be large enough to hold N items, and  M + 1 N record spaces would be required. Therefore most people rejected the idea of radix sorting within a computer, until H. H. Seward [Master’s thesis, M.I.T. Digital Computer Laboratory Report R-232  1954 , 25–28] pointed out that we can achieve the same effect with only 2N record areas and M count fields. We simply count how many elements will lie in each of the M piles, by making a preliminary pass over the data; this tells us precisely how to allocate memory for the piles. We have already made use of the same idea in the “distribution counting sort,” Algorithm 5.2D.  Thus radix sorting can be carried out as follows: Start with a distribution sort based on the least significant digit of the keys  in radix M notation , moving records from the input area to an auxiliary area. Then do another distribution sort, on the next least significant digit, moving the records back into the original input area; and so on, until the final pass  on the most significant digit  puts all records into the desired order.  If we have a decimal computer with 12-digit keys, and if N is rather large, we can choose M = 1000  considering three decimal digits as one radix-1000 digit ; then sorting will be complete in four passes, regardless of the size of N. Similarly, if we have a binary computer and a 40-bit key, we can set M = 1024 = 210 and complete the sorting in four passes. Actually each pass consists of three parts  counting, allocating, moving ; E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 151] suggested combining two of those parts at the expense of M more memory locations, by accumulating the counts for pass k + 1 while moving the records on pass k.  Table 1 shows how such a radix sort can be applied to our 16 example numbers, with M = 10. Radix sorting is generally not useful for such small N, so a small example like this is intended to illustrate the sufficiency rather than the efficiency of the method.  An alert, “modern” reader will note, however, that the whole idea of mak- ing digit counts for the storage allocation is tied to old-fashioned ideas about sequential data representation. We know that linked allocation is specifically designed to handle a set of tables of variable size, so it is natural to choose a linked data structure for radix sorting. Since we traverse each pile serially, all   5.2.5  SORTING BY DISTRIBUTION  171  Table 1  RADIX SORTING  503 087 512 061 908 170 897 275 653 426 154 509 612 677 765 703  170 061 512 612 503 653 703 154 275 765 426 087 897 677 908 509  Input area contents: Counts for units digit distribution: Storage allocations based on these counts: 1 Auxiliary area contents: Counts for tens digit distribution: Storage allocations based on these counts: 4 Input area contents: Counts for hundreds digit distribution: Storage allocations based on these counts: 2 Auxiliary area contents:  1 1 2 2 4  2 1  3 1 1 7 8 10 11 14 15 16  3 1  4 2  1 0  6 7  7 7  0 2 2  3 1  1 9 11 14 15 16  2 2  1 0 1 5 6  4 5  2 1  3 3 1 9 12 14 15 16  503 703 908 509 512 612 426 653 154 061 765 170 275 677 087 897  061 087 154 170 275 426 503 509 512 612 653 677 703 765 897 908  we need is a single link from each item to its successor. Furthermore, we never need to move the records; we merely adjust the links and proceed merrily down the lists. The amount of memory required is  1 + ϵ N + 2ϵM records, where ϵ is the amount of space taken up by a link field. Formal details of this procedure are rather interesting since they furnish an excellent example of typical data structure manipulations, combining sequential and linked allocation: Algorithm R  Radix list sort . Records R1, . . . , RN are each assumed to contain a LINK field. Their keys are assumed to be p-tuples   a1, a2, . . . , ap ,  0 ≤ ai < M,  where the order is defined lexicographically so that   a1, a2, . . . , ap  <  b1, b2, . . . , bp   if and only if for some j, 1 ≤ j ≤ p, we have   1    2   but  aj < bj.  ai = bi  for all i < j,   3  The keys may, in particular, be thought of as numbers written in radix M notation,   4  and in this case lexicographic order corresponds to the normal ordering of non- negative numbers. The keys may also be strings of alphabetic letters, etc.  a1M p−1 + a2M p−2 ··· + ap−1M + ap,  Sorting is done by keeping M “piles” of records, in a manner that exactly parallels the action of a card sorting machine. The piles are really queues in the sense of Chapter 2, since we link them together so that they are traversed in a first-in-first-out manner. There are two pointer variables TOP[i] and BOTM[i] for each pile, 0 ≤ i < M, and we assume as in Chapter 2 that  LINK LOC BOTM[i]   ≡ BOTM[i].   5    172  SORTING  5.2.5  Fig. 32. Radix list sort.  R1. [Loop on k.]  In the beginning, set P ← LOC RN , a pointer to the last record. Then perform steps R2 through R6 for k = 1, 2, . . . , p.  Steps R2 through R6 constitute one “pass.”  Then the algorithm terminates, with P pointing to the record with the smallest key, LINK P  to the record with next smallest, then LINK LINK P  , etc.; the LINK in the final record will be Λ.

Perform Algorithm H below, which “hooks together” the individual piles into one list, in preparation for the next pass. Then set P ← BOTM[0], a pointer to the first element of the hooked-up list.  See exercise 3.   Algorithm H  Hooking-up of queues .

Algorithm R is very easy to program for MIX, once a suitable way to treat the pass-by-pass variation of steps R3 and R5 has been found. The following program does this without sacrificing any speed in the inner loop, by overlaying two of the instructions. Note that TOP[i] and BOTM[i] can be packed into the same word.  Fig. 33. Radix sort using linked allocation: contents of the ten piles after each pass.  Program R  Radix list sort . The given records in locations INPUT+1 through INPUT+N are assumed to have p = 3 components  a1, a2, a3  stored respectively in the  1:1 ,  2:2 , and  3:3  fields.  Thus M is assumed to be less than or equal to the byte size of MIX.  The  4:5  field of each record is its LINK. We let TOP[i] ≡ PILES + i 1:2  and BOTM[i] ≡ PILES + i 4:5 , for 0 ≤ i < M. It is convenient to make links relative to location INPUT, so that LOC BOTM[i]  = PILES+i−INPUT; to avoid negative links we therefore want the PILES table to be  TOP[0]  TOP[1]  TOP[2]  TOP[3]  TOP[4]  TOP[5]  TOP[6]  TOP[7]  TOP[8]  TOP[9]  503  653  703  512  612  275  765  170  061  154  426  908  509  BOTM[0]  BOTM[1]  BOTM[2]  BOTM[3]  BOTM[4]  BOTM[5]  BOTM[6]  BOTM[7]  BOTM[8]  BOTM[9]  TOP[0]  TOP[1]  TOP[2]  TOP[3]  TOP[4]  TOP[5]  TOP[6]  TOP[7]  TOP[8]  TOP[9]  509  908  503  703  512  612  426  154  653  765  061  087  897  BOTM[0]  BOTM[1]  BOTM[2]  BOTM[3]  BOTM[4]  BOTM[5]  BOTM[6]  BOTM[7]  BOTM[8]  BOTM[9]  TOP[0]  TOP[1]  TOP[2]  TOP[3]  TOP[4]  TOP[5]  TOP[6]  TOP[7]  TOP[8]  TOP[9]  087  061  170  154  275  426  897  908  BOTM[0]  BOTM[1]  BOTM[2]  BOTM[3]  BOTM[4]  BOTM[5]  BOTM[6]  BOTM[7]  BOTM[8]  BOTM[9]  512  509  503  677  653  612  087  897  677  677  275  170  765  703   174  SORTING  5.2.5  Modify instructions for pass k.  1 1 3 3M 3M 3M 3M 3M 3 3 3 3  R1.

This compares very favorably with other programs we have constructed based on similar assumptions  Programs 5.2.1M, 5.2.4L . A p-pass version of the program would take  11p − 1 N + O pM  units of time; the critical factor in the timing is the inner loop, which involves five references to memory and one branch. On a typical computer we will have M = br and p = ⌈t r⌉, where t is the number of radix-b digits in the keys;   5.2.5  SORTING BY DISTRIBUTION  175  increasing r will decrease p, so the formulas can be used to determine a best value of r.  The only variable in the timing is E, the number of empty piles observed in step H4. If we consider each of the M N sequences of radix-M digits to be equally probable, we know from our study of the “poker test” in Section 3.3.2D that there are M − r empty piles with probability M M − 1  . . .  M − r + 1     on each pass, whereN   is a Stirling number of the second kind.

These machines have multiple arithmetic units and look-ahead circuitry so that memory references and computation can be highly overlapped; but their efficiency deteriorates noticeably in the presence of conditional branch instructions unless the branch almost always goes the same way. The inner loop of a radix sort is well adapted to such machines, because it is a straight iterative calculation of typical number-crunching form. Therefore radix sorting is usually more efficient than any other known method for internal sorting on such machines, provided that N is not too small and the keys are not too long.  Of course, radix sorting is not very efficient when the keys are extremely long. For example, imagine sorting 60-digit decimal numbers with 20 passes of a radix sort, using M = 103; very few pairs of numbers will tend to have identical keys in their leading 9 digits, so the first 17 passes accomplish very little. In our analysis of radix exchange sorting, we found that it was unnecessary to inspect many bits of the key, when we looked at the keys from the left instead of the right. Let us therefore reconsider the idea of a radix sort that starts at the most significant digit  MSD  instead of the least significant digit  LSD .  We have already remarked that an MSD-first radix method suggests itself naturally; in fact, it is not hard to see why the post office uses such a method to sort mail. A large collection of letters can be sorted into separate bags for different geographical areas; each of these bags then contains a smaller number of letters that can be sorted independently of the other bags, into finer and finer geographical divisions.  Indeed, bags of letters can be transported nearer to their destinations before they are sorted further, or as they are being sorted further.  This principle of “divide and conquer” is quite appealing, and the only reason it doesn’t work especially well for sorting punched cards is that it ultimately spends too much time fussing with very small piles. Algorithm R is relatively efficient, even though it considers LSD first, since we never have more than M piles, and the piles need to be hooked together only p times. On the other hand, it is not difficult to design an MSD-first radix method using linked memory, with negative links as in Algorithm 5.2.4L to denote the boundaries   176  SORTING  5.2.5  between piles.  See exercise 10.  The main difficulty is that empty piles tend to proliferate and to consume a great deal of time in an MSD-first method.  Perhaps the best compromise has been suggested by M. D. MacLaren [JACM 13  1966 , 404–411], who recommends an LSD-first sort as in Algorithm R, but applied only to the most significant digits. This does not completely sort the file, but it usually brings the file very nearly into order so that very few inversions remain; therefore straight insertion can be used to finish up. Our analysis of Program 5.2.1M applies also to this situation, so that if the keys are uniformly 4 N N − 1 M−p inversions remaining in distributed we will have an average of 1 the file after sorting on the leading p digits.  See Eq. 5.2.1– 17  and exercise 5.2.1–38.  MacLaren has computed the average number of memory references per item sorted, and the optimum choice of M and p  assuming that M is a power of 2, that the keys are uniformly distributed, and that N M p ≤ 0.1 so that deviations from uniformity are tolerable  turns out to be given by the following table:  N = 100 1000 10000 512 2 18.2  best M = 32 best p = 2 β N  = 19.3  128 2 18.5  100000 1024 2 18.1  1000000 8192 2 18.0  107 215 2 18.0  108 217 2 18.0  109 219 2 18.0  Here β N  denotes the average number of memory references per item sorted,  ;  N  √   8   β N  = 5p + 8 + 2pM  + N − 1 N it is bounded as N → ∞, if we take p = 2 and M > N, so the average sorting time is actually O N  instead of order N log N. This method is an improvement over multiple list insertion  Program 5.2.1M , which is essentially the case p = 1. Exercise 12 gives MacLaren’s interesting procedure for final rearrangement of a partially list-sorted file.  2M p − HN  rithm 5.2D and exercise 5.2–13, so that only O√  N memory locations are  It is also possible to avoid the link fields, using the methods of Algo-  needed in addition to the space required for the records themselves. The average sorting time is proportional to N if the input records are uniformly distributed. W. Dobosiewicz obtained good results by using an MSD-first distribution sort until reaching short subfiles, with the distribution process constrained so that the first M 2 piles were guaranteed to receive between 25% and 75% of the records [see Inf. Proc. Letters 7  1978 , 1–6; 8  1979 , 170–172]; this ensured that the average time to sort uniform keys would be O N  while the worst case would be O N log N . His papers inspired several other researchers to devise new address calculation algorithms, of which the most instructive is perhaps the following 2-level scheme due to Markku Tamminen [J. Algorithms 6  1985 , 138– 144]: Assume that all keys are fractions in the interval [0 . . 1 . First distribute the N records into ⌊N 8⌋ bins by mapping key K into bin ⌊KN 8⌋. Then suppose bin k has received Nk records; if Nk ≤ 16, sort it by straight insertion, otherwise   5.2.5  SORTING BY DISTRIBUTION  177  sort it by a MacLaren-like distribution-plus-insertion sort into M 2 bins, where M 2 ≈ 10Nk. Tamminen proved the following remarkable result: Theorem T. There is a constant T such that the sorting method just de- scribed performs at most T N operations on the average, whenever the keys are independent random numbers whose density function f x  is bounded and Riemann-integrable for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.  The constant T does not depend on f.  Proof. See exercise 18. Intuitively, the first distribution into N 8 piles finds intervals in which f is approximately constant; the second distribution will then make the expected bin size approximately constant.  Several versions of radix sort that have been well tuned for sorting large arrays of alphabetic strings are described in an instructive article by P. M. McIlroy, K. Bostic, and M. D. McIlroy, Computing Systems 6  1993 , 5–27.  EXERCISES   cid:120  1. [20] The algorithm of exercise 5.2–13 shows how to do a distribution sort with  only N record areas  and M count fields , instead of 2N record areas.

The arrows in Fig. 33 would go downward instead of upward, and the BOTM table would be unnecessary.  Show that if the piles are “hooked together” in an appropriate order, it is possible to achieve a valid sorting method. Does this lead to a simpler or a faster algorithm? 5. [20] What changes are necessary to Program R so that it sorts eight-byte keys instead of three-byte keys?

[30] Design an efficient most-significant-digit-first radix-sorting algorithm that uses linked memory.  As the size of the subfiles decreases, it is wise to decrease M, and to use a nonradix method on the really short subfiles.  11. [16] The sixteen input numbers shown in Table 1 start with 41 inversions; after sorting is complete, of course, there are no inversions remaining. How many inversions would be present in the file if we omitted pass 1, doing a radix sort only on the tens and hundreds digits? How many inversions would be present if we omitted both pass 1 and pass 2? 12. [24]  M. D. MacLaren.  Suppose that Algorithm R has been applied only to the p leading digits of the actual keys; thus the file is nearly sorted when we read it in the order of the links, but keys that agree in their first p digits may be out of order. Design an algorithm that rearranges the records in place so that their keys are in order, K1 ≤ K2 ≤ ··· ≤ KN. [Hint: The special case that the file is perfectly sorted appears in the answer to exercise 5.2–12; it is possible to combine this with straight insertion without loss of efficiency, since few inversions remain in the file.] 13.

Combine these piles, turn them face up, and you’re done.  Prove that this sequence of cards cannot be sorted into decreasing order K Q J . . . 2 A from top to bottom in two passes, even if you are allowed to use up to three piles for intermediate storage.  Dealing must always be from the top of the deck, turning the cards face down as they are dealt. Top to bottom is right to left in the illustration.  15.

OPTIMUM SORTING Now that we have analyzed a great many methods for internal sorting, it is time to turn to a broader question: What is the best possible way to sort? Can we place limits on the maximum sorting speeds that will ever be achievable, no matter how clever a programmer might be?  Of course there is no best possible way to sort; we must define precisely what is meant by “best,” and there is no best possible way to define “best.” We have discussed similar questions about the theoretical optimality of algo- rithms in Sections 4.3.3, 4.6.3, and 4.6.4, where high-precision multiplication and polynomial evaluation were considered. In each case it was necessary to formulate a rather simple definition of a “best possible” algorithm, in order to give sufficient structure to the problem to make it workable. And in each case we ran into interesting problems that are so difficult they still haven’t been completely resolved. The same situation holds for sorting; some very interesting discoveries have been made, but many fascinating questions remain unanswered. Studies of the inherent complexity of sorting have usually been directed towards minimizing the number of times we make comparisons between keys while sorting n items, or merging m items with n, or selecting the tth largest of an unordered set of n items. Sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, and 5.3.3 discuss these questions in general, and Section 5.3.4 deals with similar issues under the interesting restriction that the pattern of comparisons must essentially be fixed in advance. Several other types of interesting theoretical questions related to optimum sorting appear in the exercises for Section 5.3.4, and in the discussion of external sorting  Sections 5.4.4, 5.4.8, and 5.4.9 .  As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise — By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time? — CHARLES BABBAGE  1864   5.3.1. Minimum-Comparison Sorting The minimum number of key comparisons needed to sort n elements is obviously zero, because we have seen radix methods that do no comparisons at all. In fact, it is possible to write MIX programs that are able to sort, although they contain no conditional jump instructions at all!  See exercise 5–8 at the beginning of this chapter.  We have also seen several sorting methods that are based essentially on comparisons of keys, yet their running time in practice is dominated by other considerations such as data movement, housekeeping operations, etc.  Therefore it is clear that comparison counting is not the only way to measure the effectiveness of a sorting method. But it is fun to scrutinize the number of comparisons anyway, since a theoretical study of this subject gives us a good   5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  181  Fig. 34. A comparison tree for sorting three elements.  deal of useful insight into the nature of sorting processes, and it also helps us to sharpen our wits for the more mundane problems that confront us at other times. In order to rule out radix-sorting methods, which do no comparisons at all, we shall restrict our discussion to sorting techniques that are based solely on an abstract linear ordering relation “<” between keys, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter. For simplicity, we shall also confine our discussion to the case of distinct keys, so that there are only two possible outcomes of any comparison of Ki versus Kj: either Ki   Kj.  For an extension of the theory to the general case where equal keys are allowed, see exercises 3 through 12. For bounds on the worst-case running time that is needed to sort integers without the restriction to comparison-based methods, see Fredman and Willard, J. Computer and Syst. Sci. 47  1993 , 424–436; Ben-Amram and Galil, J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 54  1997 , 345–370; Thorup, SODA 9  1998 , 550–555.   The problem of sorting by comparisons can also be expressed in other equivalent ways. Given a set of n distinct weights and a balance scale, we can ask for the least number of weighings necessary to completely rank the weights in order of magnitude, when the pans of the balance scale can each accommodate only one weight. Alternatively, given a set of n players in a tournament, we can ask for the smallest number of games that suffice to rank all contestants, assuming that the strengths of the players can be linearly ordered  with no ties . All n-element sorting methods that satisfy the constraints above can be represented in terms of an extended binary tree structure such as that shown in Fig. 34. Each internal node  drawn as a circle  contains two indices “i: j” denoting a comparison of Ki versus Kj. The left subtree of this node represents the subsequent comparisons to be made if Ki < Kj, and the right subtree represents the actions to be taken when Ki > Kj. Each external node of the tree  drawn as a box  contains a permutation a1 a2 . . . an of {1, 2, . . . , n}, denoting the fact that the ordering  Ka1 < Ka2 < ··· < Kan  has been established.  If we look at the path from the root to this external node, each of the n − 1 relationships Kai < Kai+1 for 1 ≤ i < n will be the result of some comparison ai : ai+1 or ai+1: ai on this path.   Level 0  1 : 2  Level 1  2 : 3  2 : 3  Level 2  1 2 3  1 : 3  1 : 3  3 2 1  Level 3  1 3 2  3 1 2  2 1 3  2 3 1   182  SORTING  5.3.1  Fig. 35. Example of a redundant comparison.  Thus Fig. 34 represents a sorting method that first compares K1 with K2; if K1 > K2, it goes on  via the right subtree  to compare K2 with K3, and then if K2   K3 it knows that K2 < K3 < K1. An actual sorting algorithm will usually also move the keys around in the file, but we are interested here only in the comparisons, so we ignore all data movement. A comparison of Ki with Kj in this tree always means the original keys Ki and Kj, not the keys that might currently occupy the ith and jth positions of the file after the records have been shuffled around. It is possible to make redundant comparisons; for example, in Fig. 35 there is no reason to compare 3:1, since K1 < K2 and K2 < K3 implies that K1 < K3. No permutation can possibly correspond to the left subtree of node 3:1 in Fig. 35; consequently that part of the algorithm will never be performed! Since we are interested in minimizing the number of comparisons, we may assume that no re- dundant comparisons are made. Hence we have an extended binary tree structure in which every external node corresponds to a permutation. All permutations of the input keys are possible, and every permutation defines a unique path from the root to an external node; it follows that there are exactly n! external nodes in a comparison tree that sorts n elements with no redundant comparisons. The best worst case. The first problem that arises naturally is to find comparison trees that minimize the maximum number of comparisons made.  Later we shall consider the average number of comparisons.   Let S n  be the minimum number of comparisons that will suffice to sort n elements. If all the internal nodes of a comparison tree are at levels < k, it is obvious that there can be at most 2k external nodes in the tree. Hence, letting k = S n , we have  n! ≤ 2S n .  Since S n  is an integer, we can rewrite this formula to obtain the lower bound  1   S n  ≥ ⌈lg n!⌉.  Stirling’s approximation tells us that  ⌈lg n!⌉ = n lg n − n ln 2 + 1  2 lg n + O 1 ,   2   hence roughly n lg n comparisons are needed.  1 : 2  2 : 3  3 : 1   5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  183  Relation  1  is often called the information-theoretic lower bound, since cognoscenti of information theory would say that lg n! “bits of information” are being acquired during a sorting process; each comparison yields at most one bit of information. Trees such as Fig. 34 have also been called “questionnaires”; their mathematical properties were first explored systematically in Claude Picard’s book Théorie des Questionnaires  Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1965 .  Of all the sorting methods we have seen, the three that require fewest com- parisons are binary insertion  see Section 5.2.1 , tree selection  see Section 5.2.3 , and straight two-way merging  see Algorithm 5.2.4L . The maximum number of comparisons for binary insertion is readily seen to be  n  k=1  B n  =  ⌈lg k⌉ = n⌈lg n⌉ − 2⌈lg n⌉ + 1,  by exercise 1.2.4–42, and the maximum number of comparisons in two-way merging is given in exercise 5.2.4–14. We will see in Section 5.3.3 that tree selection has the same bound on its comparisons as either binary insertion or two-way merging, depending on how the tree is set up. In all three cases we achieve an asymptotic value of n lg n; combining these lower and upper bounds for S n  proves that  S n  n lg n  = 1.  lim n→∞  Thus we have an approximate formula for S n , but it is desirable to obtain more precise information. The following table gives exact values of the lower and upper bounds discussed above, for small n:  6  n = 1 2 3 4 5  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 ⌈lg n!⌉ = 0 1 3 5 7 10 13 16 19 22 26 29 33 37 41 45 49 B n  = 0 1 3 5 8 11 14 17 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 54 L n  = 0 1 3 5 9 11 14 17 25 27 30 33 38 41 45 49 65  7  8  Here B n  and L n  refer respectively to binary insertion and two-way list merging. It can be shown that B n  ≤ L n  for all n  see exercise 2 .  From the table above, we can see that S 4  = 5, but S 5  might be either 7 or 8. This brings us back to a problem stated at the beginning of Section 5.2: What is the best way to sort five elements? Can five elements be sorted using only seven comparisons?  The answer is yes, but a seven-step procedure is not especially easy to discover. We begin by first comparing K1 : K2, then K3 : K4, then the larger elements of these pairs. This produces a configuration that may be diagrammed   3    4    5   to indicate that a < b < d and c < d.  It is convenient to represent known ordering relations between elements by drawing directed graphs such as this,  b  d  a  c  e   5.3.1   6    7    8    9   184  SORTING  where x is known to be less than y if and only if there is a path from x to y in the graph.  At this point we insert the fifth element K5 = e into its proper place among {a, b, d}; only two comparisons are needed, since we may compare it first with b and then with a or d. This leaves one of four possibilities,  and in each case we can insert c among the remaining elements less than d in one or two more comparisons. This method for sorting five elements was first found by H. B. Demuth [Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University  1956 , 41–43]. Merge insertion. A pleasant generalization of the method above has been discovered by Lester Ford, Jr. and Selmer Johnson. Since it involves some aspects of merging and some aspects of insertion, we shall call it merge insertion. For example, consider the problem of sorting 21 elements. We start by comparing the ten pairs K1 : K2, K3 : K4, . . . , K19 : K20; then we sort the ten larger elements of the pairs, using merge insertion. As a result we obtain the configuration  analogous to  5 . The next step is to insert b3 among {b1, a1, a2}, then b2 among the other elements less than a2; we arrive at the configuration  Let us call the upper-line elements the main chain. We can insert b5 into its proper place in the main chain, using three comparisons  first comparing it to c4, then c2 or c6, etc. ; then b4 can be moved into the main chain in three more steps, leading to  The next step is crucial; is it clear what to do? We insert b11  not b7  into the main chain, using only four comparisons. Then b10, b9, b8, b7, b6  in this order  can also be inserted into their proper places in the main chain, using at most four comparisons each.  A careful count of the comparisons involved here shows that the 21 elements have been sorted in at most 10 + S 10  + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66 steps. Since  265 < 21! < 266,  b  d  e  b  d  b  e  d  b  d  e  e  a  c  a  c  a  c  a  c  a1  a2  a3  a4  a5  a6  a7  a8  a9  a10  b1  b2  b3  b4  b5  b6  b7  b8  b9  b10  b11  c1  c2  c3  c4  c5  c6  a4  a5  a6  a7  a8  a9  a10  b4  b5  b6  b7  b8  b9  b10  b11  d1  d2  d3  d4  d5  d6  d7  d8  d9  d10  a6  a7  a8  a9  a10  b6  b7  b8  b9  b10  b11   5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  we also know that no fewer than 66 would be possible in any event; hence  S 21  = 66.  185   10    Binary insertion would have required 74 comparisons.   In general, merge insertion proceeds as follows for n elements:  leave one element out.   , b1, b2, . . . , b⌈n 2⌉  i  Make pairwise comparisons of ⌊n 2⌋ disjoint pairs of elements.  If n is odd, ii  Sort the ⌊n 2⌋ larger numbers, found in step  i , by merge insertion. iii  Name the elements a1, a2, . . . , a⌊n 2⌋  as in  7 , where a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ··· ≤ a⌊n 2⌋ and bi ≤ ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ ⌊n 2⌋; call b1 and the a’s the “main chain.” Insert the remaining b’s into the main chain, using binary insertion, in the following order, leaving out all bj for j > ⌈n 2⌉: b3, b2; b5, b4; b11, b10, . . . , b6; . . . ; btk , btk−1, . . . , btk−1+1; . . . .   11  We wish to define the sequence  t1, t2, t3, t4, . . .   =  1, 3, 5, 11, . . .  , which appears in  11 , in such a way that each of btk , btk−1, . . . , btk−1+1 can be inserted into the main chain with at most k comparisons. Generalizing  7 ,  8 , and  9 , we obtain the diagram  where the main chain up to and including atk−1 contains 2tk−1 +  tk − tk−1 − 1  elements. This number must be less than 2k; our best bet is to set it equal to 2k − 1, so that  tk−1 + tk = 2k.   12   Since t1 = 1, we may set t0 = 1 for convenience, and we find that  tk = 2k − tk−1 = 2k − 2k−1 + tk−2 = ··· = 2k − 2k−1 + ··· +  −1 k20   13  by summing a geometric series.  Curiously, this same sequence arose in our study of an algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two integers; see exercise 4.5.2–36.   =2k+1 +  −1 k 3  Let F n  be the number of comparisons required to sort n elements by merge  F n  = ⌊n 2⌋ + F ⌊n 2⌋  + G⌈n 2⌉,   14  where G represents the amount of work involved in step  iii .

Exercise 13 shows that  17   F n  − F n − 1  = k  wk < n ≤ wk+1,  if and only if  and the latter condition is equivalent to  or k + 1 < lg 3n ≤ k + 2; hence   18   This formula is due to A.

He described the method of binary insertion, which is the best possible way to sort n objects if we start by sorting n−1 of them first before the nth is considered; and he conjectured that binary insertion would be optimum in general. Several years later [Calcutta Math. Soc. Golden Jubilee Commemoration 2  1959 , 323–327], he reported that two of his colleagues, S. Trybuła and P. Czen, had “recently” disproved his conjecture, and that they had determined S n  for n ≤ 11. Trybuła and Czen may have independently discovered the method of merge insertion, which was published soon afterwards by Ford and Johnson [AMM 66  1959 , 387–389].  After the discovery of merge insertion, the first unknown value of S n  was S 12 . Table 1 shows that 12! is quite close to 229, hence the existence of a   5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  187  Table 1  VALUES OF FACTORIALS IN BINARY NOTATION   1 2 = 1!  10 2 = 2!  110 2 = 3!  11000 2 = 4!  1111000 2 = 5!  1011010000 2 = 6!  1001110110000 2 = 7!  1001110110000000 2 = 8!  1011000100110000000 2 = 9!  1101110101111100000000 2 = 10!  10011000010001010100000000 2 = 11!  11100100011001111110000000000 2 = 12!  101110011001010001100110000000000 2 = 13!  1010001001100001110110010100000000000 2 = 14!  10011000001110111011101110101100000000000 2 = 15!  100110000011101110111011101011000000000000000 2 = 16!  1010000110111111011101110110011011000000000000000 2 = 17!  10110101111101110110011001010011100110000000000000000 2 = 18!  110110000001010111001001100000110100010010000000000000000 2 = 19!  10000111000011011001110111110010000010101101000000000000000000 2 = 20!  29-step sorting procedure for 12 elements is somewhat unlikely. An exhaustive search  about 60 hours on a Maniac II computer  was therefore carried out by Mark Wells, who discovered that S 12  = 30 [Proc. IFIP Congress 65 2  1965 , 497–498; Elements of Combinatorial Computing  Pergamon, 1971 , 213–215]. Thus the merge insertion procedure turns out to be optimum for n = 12 as well. *A slightly deeper analysis. In order to study S n  more carefully, let us look more closely at partial ordering diagrams such as  5 . After several comparisons have been made, we can represent the knowledge we have gained in terms of a directed graph. This directed graph contains no cycles, in view of the transitivity of the < relation, so we can draw it in such a way that all arcs go from left to right; it is therefore convenient to leave arrows off the diagram. In this way  5  becomes   21   If G is such a directed graph, let T G  be the number of permutations consistent with G, that is, the number of ways to assign the integers {1, 2, . . . , n} to the vertices of G so that the number on vertex x is less than the number on vertex y whenever x → y in G. For example, one of the permutations consistent with  21  has a = 1, b = 4, c = 2, d = 5, e = 3. We have studied T G  for various G in Section 5.1.4, where we observed that T G  is the number of ways in which G can be sorted topologically.  b  d  a  c  e   188  SORTING  If G is a graph on n elements that can be obtained after k comparisons, we  define the efficiency of G to be  5.3.1   22   E G  =  n!  2kT G  .   This idea is due to Frank Hwang and Shen Lin.  Strictly speaking, the efficiency is not a function of the graph G alone, it depends on the way we arrived at G during a sorting process, but it is convenient to be a little careless in our language. After making one more comparison, between elements i and j, we obtain two graphs G1 and G2, one for the case Ki   Kj. Clearly  If T G1  ≥ T G2 , we have  T G  = T G1  + T G2 .  T G  ≤ 2T G1 , n!   cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    23   E G1  =  2T G1  ≤ E G . Therefore each comparison leads to at least one graph of less or equal efficiency; we can’t improve the efficiency by making further comparisons.  2k+1T G1  = E G T G   When G has no arcs at all, we have k = 0 and T G  = n!, so the initial efficiency is 1. At the other extreme, when G is a graph representing the final result of sorting, G looks like a straight line and T G  = 1. Thus, for example, if we want to find a sorting procedure that sorts five elements in at most seven , whose efficiency is 5!  27×1  = steps, we must obtain the linear graph 120 128 = 15 16. It follows that all of the graphs arising in the sorting procedure must have efficiency ≥ 15 16; if any less efficient graph were to appear, at least one of its descendants would also be less efficient, and we would ultimately reach a linear graph whose efficiency is < 15 16. In general, this argument proves that all graphs corresponding to the tree nodes of a sorting procedure for n elements must have efficiency ≥ n! 2l, where l is the number of levels of the tree  not counting external nodes . This is another way to prove that S n  ≥ ⌈lg n!⌉, although the argument is not really much different from what we said before.  The graph  21  has efficiency 1, since T G  = 15 and since G has been obtained in three comparisons. In order to see what vertices should be compared next, we can form the comparison matrix   cid:113     a 0 0 5 0 4  a b c d e  b 15 0 10 0 8  c 10 5 0 0 6  d 15 15 15 0 12  ,  e 11 7 9 3 0  C G  =   24   where Cij is T G1  for the graph G1 obtained by adding the arc i → j to G. For example, if we compare Kc with Ke, the 15 permutations consistent with G   5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  189  split up into Cec = 6 having Ke < Kc and Cce = 9 having Kc < Ke. The latter graph would have efficiency 15  2 × 9  = 5 16, so it could not lead to a seven-step sorting procedure. The next comparison must be Kb : Ke in order to keep the efficiency ≥ 15 16.  The concept of efficiency is especially useful when we consider the connected  6 < 15  components of graphs. Consider for example the graph  G =  ;  it has two components  G′ =  and  G′′ =  with no arcs connecting G′ to G′′, so it has been formed by making some comparisons entirely within G′ and others entirely within G′′. In general, assume that G = G′ ⊕ G′′ has no arcs between G′ and G′′, where G′ and G′′ have respectively n′ and n′′ vertices; it is easy to see that  T G  =  T G′  T G′′ ,   25    n′ + n′′    n′  since each consistent permutation of G is obtained by choosing n′ elements to assign to G′ and then making consistent permutations within G′ and G′′ independently. If k′ comparisons have been made within G′ and k′′ within G′′, we have the basic result  E G  =  n′ + n′′ !  2k′+k′′  T G  =  2k′  n′! T G′   n′′! T G′′  = E G′ E G′′ ,  2k′′   26   showing that the efficiency of a graph is related in a simple way to the efficiency of its components. Therefore we may restrict consideration to graphs having only one component.  Now suppose that G′ and G′′ are one-component graphs, and suppose that we want to hook them together by comparing a vertex x of G′ with a vertex y of G′′. We want to know how efficient this will be. For this purpose we need a  function that can be denoted by  p    ,  <  m  q n  defined to be the number of permutations consistent with the graph   27    28   a  b  c  d  f  e  g  a  b  c  d  f  e  g  a1  a2  ap  am  b1  b2  bq  bn   n  m  190  5.3.1  m < q  SORTING   is m+n  p  m numbers is less than the qth smallest of an independently chosen set of n  Thus  p numbers.

This is a formidable number of permutations  It is not hard to show by direct enumeration that T G′  = 42 and T G′′  = 5; so if G is the 11-vertex graph having G′ and G′′ as components, we have T G  = 4 to list, if we want to know how many of them have xi < yj for each i and j. But the calculation can be done by hand, in less than an hour, as follows. We form the matrices A G′  and A G′′ , where Aik is the number of consistent permutations of G′  or G′′  in which xi  or yi  is equal to k. Thus the number of permutations of G in which xi is less than yj is the  i, p  element of A G′  times 7 < q 4 In other words, we want to form the matrix product A G′  · L · A G′′ T , where   times the  j, q  element of A G′′ , summed over 1 ≤ p ≤ 7 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 4.   .

Some graphs and their efficiencies, obtained at the beginning of a long proof that S 12  > 29.  Thus the “best” way to hook up G′ and G′′ is to compare x1 with y2; this gives 42042 cases with x1   y2.  By symmetry, we could also compare x3 with y2, x5 with y3, or x7 with y3, leading to essentially the same results.  The efficiency of the resulting graph for x1 < y2 is  69300 84084 E G′ E G′′ ,  which is none too good; hence it is probably a bad idea to hook G′ up with G′′ in any sorting method. The point of this example is that we are able to make such a decision without excessive calculation.  These ideas can be used to provide independent confirmation of Mark Wells’s proof that S 12  = 30. Starting with a graph containing one vertex, we can repeatedly try to add a comparison to one of our graphs G or to G′ ⊕ G′′  a pair of graph components G′ and G′′  in such a way that the two resulting graphs have 12 or fewer vertices and efficiency ≥ 12! 229 ≈ 0.89221. Whenever this is possible, we take the resulting graph of least efficiency and add it to our set, unless one of the two graphs is isomorphic to a graph we already have included. If both of the resulting graphs have the same efficiency, we arbitrarily choose one of them. A graph can be identified with its dual  obtained by reversing the order , so long as we consider adding comparisons to G′ ⊕ dual G′′  as well as to G′ ⊕ G′′. A few of the smallest graphs obtained in this way are displayed in Fig. 36 together with their efficiencies. Exactly 1649 graphs were generated, by computer, before this process ter- was not obtained, we may minated. Since the graph conclude that S 12  > 29. It is plausible that a similar experiment could be performed to deduce that S 22  > 70 in a fairly reasonable amount of time, since 22! 270 ≈ 0.952 requires extremely high efficiency to sort in 70 steps.  Only 91 of the 1649 graphs found on 12 or fewer vertices had such high efficiency.    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113    cid:113   G1  1  1  1  15 16  G2  G6  G10  15 16  105 116  1  G14  G3  G7  G11  G15  15 16  315 352  1  35 36  G18  21 22  G19  315 326  G22  15 16  G23  G5  G9  G13  G17  G21  G4  G8  G12  G16  G20  G24  15 16  315 352  1  315 332  15 16  15 16  1  63 64  315 316  63 64   192  SORTING  5.3.1  Marcin Peczarski [see Algorithmica 40  2004 , 133–145; Information Proc. Letters 101  2007 , 126–128] extended Wells’s method and proved that S 13  = 34, S 14  = 38, S 15  = 42, S 22  = 71; thus merge insertion is optimum in those cases as well. Intuitively, it seems likely that S 16  will some day be shown to be less than F 16 , since F 16  involves no fewer steps than sorting ten elements with S 10  comparisons and then inserting six others by binary insertion, one at a time. There must be a way to improve upon this! But at present, the smallest case where F n  is definitely known to be nonoptimum is n = 47: After sorting 5 and 42 elements with F 5  + F 42  = 178 comparisons, we can merge the results with 22 further comparisons, using a method due to J. Schulte Mönting, Theoretical Comp. Sci. 14  1981 , 19–37; this strategy beats F 47  = 201.  Glenn K. Manacher [JACM 26  1979 , 441–456] had previously proved that infinitely many n exist with S n  < F n , starting with n = 189.  The average number of comparisons. So far we have been considering procedures that are best possible in the sense that their worst case isn’t bad; in other words, we have looked for “minimax” procedures that minimize the maximum number of comparisons. Now let us look for a “minimean” procedure that minimizes the average number of comparisons, assuming that the input is random so that each permutation is equally likely.  Consider once again the tree representation of a sorting procedure, as shown  in Fig. 34. The average number of comparisons in that tree is  2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2  = 2 2 3 ,  6  averaging over all permutations. In general, the average number of comparisons in a sorting method is the external path length of the tree divided by n!.  Recall that the external path length is the sum of the distances from the root to each of the external nodes; see Section 2.3.4.5.  It is easy to see from the considerations of Section 2.3.4.5 that the minimum external path length occurs in a binary tree with N external nodes if there are 2q − N external nodes at level q − 1 and 2N − 2q at level q, where q = ⌈lg N⌉.  The root is at level zero.  The minimum external path length is therefore   q − 1  2q − N  + q 2N − 2q  =  q + 1 N − 2q.   34  The minimum path length can also be characterized in another interesting way: An extended binary tree has minimum external path length for a given number of external nodes if and only if there is a number l such that all external nodes appear on levels l and l + 1.  See exercise 20.  If we set q = lg N + θ, where 0 ≤ θ < 1, the formula for minimum external  path length becomes   35  The function 1 + θ − 2θ is shown in Fig. 37; for 0 < θ < 1 it is positive but very small, never exceeding  N  lg N + 1 + θ − 2θ .  1 −  1 + ln ln 2   ln 2 = 0.08607 13320 55934+.   36    5.3.1  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SORTING  193  Fig. 37. The function 1 + θ − 2θ.  Thus the minimum possible average number of comparisons, obtained by dividing  35  by N, is never less than lg N and never more than lg N +0.0861. [This result was first obtained by A. Gleason in an internal IBM memorandum  1956 .]  Now if we set N = n!, we get a lower bound for the average number of comparisons in any sorting scheme. Asymptotically speaking, this lower bound is  37  Let F n  be the average number of comparisons performed by the merge  lg n! + O 1  = n lg n − n ln 2 + O log n .  insertion algorithm; we have n = 1 lower bound  34  = 0 n!

A moment’s reflection shows why this is true: Some “fortunate” permutations of six elements are sorted by merge insertion after only eight comparisons, so the comparison tree has external nodes appearing on three levels instead of two. This forces the overall path length to be higher. Exercise 24 shows that it is possible to construct a six-element sorting procedure that requires nine or ten comparisons in each case; it follows that this method is superior to merge insertion, on the average, and no worse than merge insertion in its worst case.  When n = 7, Y. Césari [Thesis  Univ. of Paris, 1968 , page 37] has shown that no sorting method can attain the lower bound 62368 on external path length.  It is possible to prove this fact without a computer, using the results of exercise 22.  On the other hand, he has constructed procedures that do achieve the lower bound  34  when n = 9 or 10. In general, the problem of minimizing the average number of comparisons turns out to be substantially more difficult than the problem of determining S n . It may even be true that, for some n, all methods that minimize the average number of comparisons require more than S n  comparisons in their worst case.  EXERCISES 1.

When equality between keys is allowed, there are 13 possible outcomes when sorting three elements:  K1 = K2 = K3, K2 = K3 < K1, K3 < K1 = K2,  K1 = K2 < K3, K1 < K2 = K3, K1 < K2 < K3,  K1 = K3 < K2, K2 < K1 = K3, K1 < K3 < K2,  K2 < K1 < K3,  K2 < K3 < K1,  K3 < K1 < K2,  K3 < K2 < K1.

[16] When keys can be equal, each comparison may have three results instead of two: Ki   Kj. Sorting algorithms for this general situation can be represented as extended ternary trees, in which each internal node i: j has three subtrees; the left, middle, and right subtrees correspond respectively to the three possible outcomes of the comparison.  Draw an extended ternary tree that defines a sorting algorithm for n = 3, when equal keys are allowed. There should be 13 external nodes, corresponding to the 13 possible outcomes listed in exercise 3.   cid:120  6. [M22] Let S′ n  be the minimum number of comparisons necessary to sort n  elements and to determine all equalities between keys, when each comparison has three outcomes as in exercise 5. The information-theoretic argument of the text can readily be generalized to show that S′ n  ≥ ⌈log3 Pn⌉, where Pn is the function studied in exercises 3 and 4; but prove that, in fact, S′ n  = S n . 7. [20] Draw an extended ternary tree in the sense of exercise 5 for sorting four elements, when it is known that all keys are either 0 or 1.  Thus if K1 < K2 and K3 < K4, we know that K1 = K3 and K2 = K4!  Use the minimum average number of comparisons, assuming that the 24 possible inputs are equally likely. Be sure to determine all equalities that are present; for example, don’t stop sorting when you know only that K1 ≤ K2 ≤ K3 ≤ K4. 8. [26] Draw an extended ternary tree as in exercise 7 for sorting four elements, when it is known that all keys are either −1, 0, or +1.

Renumber the keys in terms of increasing ui vi, so that u1 v1 ≤ u2 v2 ≤ ··· ≤ un vn. Now compare Ki : Ki+1 for some i that minimizes uivi+1 − ui+1vi.  Although this method is based on far less information than a full comparison matrix as in  24 , it appears to give optimum results in many cases.    cid:120  20.

[M21] The height of an extended binary tree is the maximum level number of its external nodes. If x is an internal node of an extended binary tree, let t x  be the number of external nodes below x, and let l x  denote the root of x’s left subtree. If x is an external node, let t x  = 1.

[Thus, for example, if t x  = 67, we must have t l x   = 32, 33, 34, or 35. If we merely wanted to minimize the height of the tree we could have 3 ≤ t l x   ≤ 64, by the preceding exercise.]   196  SORTING  5.3.1  23.

[M23]  Optimum exchange sorting.  Every exchange sorting algorithm as defined in Section 5.2.2 can be represented as a comparison-exchange tree, namely a binary tree structure whose internal nodes have the form i: j for i < j, interpreted as the following operation: “If Ki ≤ Kj, continue by taking the left branch of the tree; if Ki > Kj, continue by interchanging records i and j and then taking the right branch of the tree.” When an external node is encountered, it must be true that K1 ≤ K2 ≤ ··· ≤ Kn. Thus, a comparison-exchange tree differs from a comparison tree in that it specifies data movement as well as comparison operations.  Let Se n  denote the minimum number of comparison-exchanges needed, in the worst case, to sort n elements by means of a comparison-exchange tree. Prove that Se n  ≤ S n  + n − 1. 31. [M38] Continuing exercise 30, prove that Se 5  = 8. 32. [M42] Continuing exercise 31, investigate Se n  for small values of n > 5. 33. [M30]  T. N. Hibbard.  A real-valued search tree of order x and resolution δ is an extended binary tree in which all nodes contain a nonnegative real value such that  i  the value in each external node is ≤ δ,  ii  the value in each internal node is at most the sum of the values in its two children, and  iii  the value in the root is x. The weighted path length of such a tree is defined to be the sum, over all external nodes, of the level of that node times the value it contains.  Prove that a real-valued search tree of order x and resolution 1 has minimum weighted path length, taken over all such trees of the same order and resolution, if and only if equality holds in  ii  and the following further conditions hold for all pairs of values x0 and x1 that are contained in sibling nodes:  iv  There is no integer k ≥ 0 such that x0 < 2k < x1 or x1 < 2k < x0.  v  ⌈x0⌉− x0 +⌈x1⌉− x1 < 1.  In particular if x is an integer, condition  v  implies that all values in the tree are integers, and condition  iv  is equivalent to the result of exercise 22.    5.3.2  MINIMUM-COMPARISON MERGING  197  Also prove that the corresponding minimum weighted path length is x⌈lg x⌉ +  ⌈x⌉ − 2⌈lg x⌉. 34.

Minimum-Comparison Merging Let us now consider a related question: What is the best way to merge an ordered set of m elements with an ordered set of n? Denoting the elements to be merged by  and  A1 < A2 < ··· < Am  B1 < B2 < ··· < Bn,   1  we shall assume as in Section 5.3.1 that the m + n elements are distinct. The  A’s may appear among the B’s inm+n  ways, so the arguments we have used   m + n  for the sorting problem tell us immediately that at least   2  comparisons are required. If we set m = αn and let n → ∞, while α is fixed, Stirling’s approximation tells us that    lg  m  m   αn + n    = n 1 + α  lg 1 + α  − α lg α − 1  lg  αn   3  The normal merging procedure, Algorithm 5.2.4M, takes m + n− 1 comparisons in its worst case.  2 lg n + O 1 .  Let M m, n  denote the function analogous to S n , namely the minimum number of comparisons that will always suffice to merge m things with n. By the observations we have just made,  ≤ M m, n  ≤ m + n − 1  for all m, n ≥ 1.   4    m + n      lg  m  Formula  3  shows how far apart this lower bound and upper bound can be. When α = 1  that is, m = n , the lower bound is 2n − 1 2 lg n + O 1 , so both bounds have the right order of magnitude but the difference between them can be arbitrarily large. When α = 0.5  that is, m = 1 3  + O log n ,  2 n , the lower bound is  2 n lg 3 − 2  which is about lg 3 − 2 3 ≈ 0.918 times the upper bound. And as α decreases, the bounds get farther and farther apart, since the standard merging algorithm is primarily designed for files with m ≈ n.  3   198  SORTING  5.3.2  When m = n, the merging problem has a fairly simple solution; it turns out that the lower bound of  4 , not the upper bound, is at fault. The follow- ing theorem was discovered independently by R. L. Graham and R. M. Karp about 1968: Theorem M. For all m ≥ 1, we have M m, m  = 2m − 1. Proof. Consider any algorithm that merges A1 < ··· < Am with B1 < ··· < Bm. When it compares Ai : Bj, take the branch Ai   Bj if i ≥ j. Merging must eventually terminate with the configuration  B1 < A1 < B2 < A2 < ··· < Bm < Am,   5  since this is consistent with all the branches taken. And each of the 2m − 1 comparisons  B1 : A1, A1 : B2, B2 : A2,  . . . , Bm : Am  must have been made explicitly, or else there would be at least two configurations consistent with the known facts. For example, if A1 has not been compared to B2, the configuration  B1 < B2 < A1 < A2 < ··· < Bm < Am  is indistinguishable from  5 .  A simple modification of this proof yields the companion formula  for m ≥ 0.  M m, m+1  = 2m,   6  Constructing lower bounds. Theorem M shows that the “information the- oretic” lower bound  2  can be arbitrarily far from the true value; thus the technique used to prove Theorem M gives us another way to discover lower bounds. Such a proof technique is often viewed as the creation of an adversary, a pernicious being who tries to make algorithms run slowly. When an algorithm for merging decides to compare Ai : Bj, the adversary determines the fate of the comparison so as to force the algorithm down the more difficult path. If we can invent a suitable adversary, as in the proof of Theorem M, we can ensure that every valid merging algorithm will have to make quite a few comparisons.  We shall make use of constrained adversaries, whose power is limited with regard to the outcomes of certain comparisons. A merging method that is under the influence of a constrained adversary does not know about the constraints, so it must make the necessary comparisons even though their outcomes have been predetermined. For example, in our proof of Theorem M we constrained all outcomes by condition  5 , yet the merging algorithm was unable to make use of that fact in order to avoid any of the comparisons.  The constraints we shall use in the following discussion apply to the left and  right ends of the files. Left constraints are symbolized by  .  meaning no left constraint , \  meaning that all outcomes must be consistent with A1 < B1 ,    meaning that all outcomes must be consistent with A1 > B1 ;   5.3.2  MINIMUM-COMPARISON MERGING  199  similarly, right constraints are symbolized by  .  meaning no right constraint , \  meaning that all outcomes must be consistent with Am < Bn ,    meaning that all outcomes must be consistent with Am > Bn .  There are nine kinds of adversaries, denoted by λMρ, where λ is a left constraint and ρ is a right constraint. For example, a \M\ adversary must say that A1 < Bj and Ai < Bn; a .M. adversary is unconstrained. For small values of m and n, constrained adversaries of certain kinds are impossible; when m = 1 we obviously can’t have a \M  adversary.  Let us now construct a rather complicated, but very formidable, adversary for merging. It does not always produce optimum results, but it gives lower bounds that cover a lot of interesting cases. Given m, n, and the left and right constraints λ and ρ, suppose the adversary is asked which is the greater of Ai or Bj. Six strategies can be used to reduce the problem to cases of smaller m+n: Strategy A k, l , for i ≤ k ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ j. Say that Ai < Bj, and require that subsequent operations merge {A1, . . . , Ak} with {B1, . . . , Bl−1} and {Ak+1, . . . , Am} with {Bl, . . . , Bn}. Thus future comparisons Ap : Bq will result in Ap   Bq if p > k and q < l; they will be handled by a  k, l−1, λ, .  adversary if p ≤ k and q < l; they will be handled by an  m−k, n+1−l, . , ρ  adversary if p > k and q ≥ l. Strategy B k, l , for i ≤ k ≤ m and 1 ≤ l < j. Say that Ai < Bj, and require that subsequent operations merge {A1, . . . , Ak} with {B1, . . . , Bl} and {Ak+1, . . . , Am} with {Bl, . . . , Bn}, stipulating that Ak < Bl < Ak+1.  Note that Bl appears in both lists to be merged. The condition Ak < Bl < Ak+1 ensures that merging one group gives no information that could help to merge the other.  Thus future comparisons Ap : Bq will result in Ap < Bq if p ≤ k and q ≥ l; Ap > Bq if p > k and q ≤ l; they will be handled by a  k, l, λ,\  adversary if p ≤ k and q ≤ l; by an  m−k, n+1−l,  , ρ  adversary if p > k and q ≥ l. Strategy C k, l , for i < k ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ j. Say that Ai < Bj, and require that subsequent operations merge {A1, . . . , Ak} with {B1, . . . , Bl−1} and {Ak, . . . , Am} with {Bl, . . . , Bn}, stipulating that Bl−1 < Ak < Bl.  Analogous to Strategy B, interchanging the roles of A and B.  Strategy A′ k, l , for 1 ≤ k ≤ i and j ≤ l ≤ n.

Strategy B′ k, l , for 1 ≤ k ≤ i and j   Bj, and require the merging of {A1, . . . , Ak−1} with {B1, . . . , Bl} and {Ak, . . . , Am} with {Bl, . . . , Bn}, subject to Ak−1 < Bl < Ak.

Each strategy, when applicable, gives us an inequality relating these nine functions, when the first comparison is Ai : Bj, namely,  λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM. k, l−1  + .Mρ m−k, n+1−l ; λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM\ k, l  +  Mρ m−k, n+1−l ; λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM  k, l−1  + \Mρ m+1−k, n+1−l ;  A k, l : B k, l : C k, l : A′ k, l : λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM. k−1, l  + .Mρ m+1−k, n−l ; B′ k, l : λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM\ k−1, l  +  Mρ m+1−k, n+1−l ; C′ k, l : λMρ m, n  ≥ 1 + λM  k, l  + \Mρ m+1−k, n−l .  For fixed i and j, the adversary will adopt a strategy that maximizes the lower bound given by all possible right-hand sides, when k and l lie in the ranges permitted by i and j. Then we define λMρ m, n  to be the minimum of these lower bounds taken over 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n. When m or n is zero, λMρ m, n  is zero.  For example, consider the case m = 2 and n = 3, and suppose that our adversary is unconstrained. If the first comparison is A1 : B1, the adversary may adopt strategy A′ 1, 1 , requiring .M. 0, 1  + .M. 2, 2  = 3 further comparisons. If the first comparison is A1 : B3, the adversary may adopt strategy B 1, 2 , requiring .M\ 1, 2  +  M. 1, 2  = 4 further comparisons. No matter what comparison Ai : Bj is made first, the adversary can guarantee that at least three further comparisons must be made. Hence .M. 2, 3  = 4.  It isn’t easy to do these calculations by hand, but a computer can grind out tables of λMρ functions rather quickly. There are obvious symmetries, such as  7    M. m, n  = .M\ m, n  = \M. n, m  = .M  n, m , by means of which we can reduce the nine functions to just four,  .M. m, n ,   M. m, n ,   M\ m, n ,  and   M  m, n .  Table 1 shows the resulting values for all m, n ≤ 10; our merging adversary has been defined in such a way that  .M. m, n  ≤ M m, n   for all  m, n ≥ 0.   8    5.3.2  MINIMUM-COMPARISON MERGING  201  LOWER BOUNDS FOR MERGING, FROM THE “ADVERSARY”  Table 1  9 10 n 4 7 9  8 4 6 8  7 3 6 8  .M. m, n  6 4 5 3 3 3 4 3 2 6 5 7 5 4 6 7 9 7 5 8 7 9 10 10 11 11 6 8 9 10 11 12 12 13 7 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 8 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 8 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 9 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 9 11 13 15 16 17 18 19  1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4  2 2 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  m  1 −∞ 2 2 −∞ 2 3 −∞ 2 4 −∞ 2 5 −∞ 2 6 −∞ 2 7 −∞ 2 8 −∞ 2 9 −∞ 2 10 −∞ 2 2  1  2 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 3  4 7 8  4 6 8   M\ m, n  4 3 3 3 3 7 6 5 5 4 8 9 6 7 6 8 9 10 10 11 6 8 8 10 10 11 12 13 7 9 10 12 13 14 14 7 8 10 11 12 14 15 16 8 10 12 13 15 16 17 9 10 12 14 16 17 18 9 11 13 15 16 18 19 4  6  7  5  8  9 10 n  8 4 6 8   M. m, n  7 9 10 5 6 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 6 7 7 5 5 4 4 3 8 9 9 7 6 7 5 4 8 9 10 10 11 7 9 5 5 8 9 10 11 12 12 13 6 6 8 10 11 12 13 14 14 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 15 16 7 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 17 7 8 10 11 13 15 16 17 18 9 8 10 12 14 15 17 18 19 10  m  1 4 7 9  1 5 7 9   M  m, n  1 1 1 1 1 5 5 4 4 4 8 8 6 6 5 8 9 10 7 7 9 9 10 11 11 12 7 9 11 11 12 13 14 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 15 9 11 12 14 15 16 17 9 11 13 15 16 17 18  1 1 2 3 3 5 4 5 5 6 6 6 7 7 8 7 8 9 8 10 12 14 15 17 18 19 10 3  9 10  8  7  6  4  5  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  2 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5  1 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 2  This relation includes Theorem M as a special case, because our adversary will use the simple strategy of that theorem when m − n ≤ 1.  Let us now consider some simple relations satisfied by the M function:  M k+m, n  ≤ M k, n  + M m, n ;  M m, n  = M n, m ; M m, n  ≤ M m, n+1 ;  M m, n  ≤ maxM m, n−1  + 1, M m−1, n  + 1, M m, n  ≤ maxM m, n−2  + 1, M m−1, n  + 2,   9   10   11   12   13  if we first compare Relation  12  comes from the usual merging procedure, A1 :B1. Relation  13  is derived similarly, by first comparing A1 :B2; if A1 > B2, we need M m, n−2  more comparisons, but if A1 < B2, we can insert A1 into its proper place and merge {A2, . . . , Am} with {B1, . . . , Bn}. Generalizing, we can see that if m ≥ 1 and n ≥ k we have  M m, n  ≤ maxM m, n−k  + 1, M m−1, n  + 1 + ⌈lg k⌉,  for m ≥ 1, n ≥ 1; for m ≥ 1, n ≥ 2.   14   by first comparing A1 : Bk and using binary search if A1 < Bk.  It turns out that M m, n  = .M. m, n  for all m, n ≤ 10, so Table 1 actually gives the optimum values for merging. This can be proved by using  9 – 14  together with special constructions for  m, n  =  2, 8 ,  3, 6 , and  5, 9  given in exercises 8, 9, and 10.   202  SORTING  5.3.2  On the other hand, our adversary doesn’t always give the best possible lower bounds; the simplest example is m = 3, n = 11, when .M. 3, 11  = 9 but M 3, 11  = 10. To see where the adversary has “failed” in this case, we must study the reasons for its decisions. Further scrutiny reveals that if  i, j  ̸=  2, 6 , the adversary can find a strategy that demands 10 comparisons; but when  i, j  =  2, 6 , no strategy beats Strategy A 2, 4 , leading to the lower bound 1 + .M. 2, 3  + .M. 1, 8  = 9. It is necessary but not sufficient to finish by merging {A1, A2} with {B1, B2, B3} and {A3} with {B4, . . . , B11}, so the lower bound fails to be sharp in this case.  Similarly it can be shown that .M. 2, 38  = 10 while M 2, 38  = 11, so our adversary isn’t even good enough to solve the case m = 2. But there is an infinite class of values for which it excels: Theorem K. M m, m+2  = 2m + 1, M m, m+3  = 2m + 2, M m, m+4  = 2m + 3,  for m ≥ 2; for m ≥ 4; for m ≥ 6.  Proof. We can in fact prove the result with M replaced by .M. ; for small m the results have been obtained by computer, so we may assume that m is sufficiently large. We may also assume that the first comparison is Ai : Bj where i ≤ ⌈m 2⌉. If j ≤ i we use strategy A′ i, i , obtaining  .M. m, m+d  ≥ 1 + .M. i−1, i  + .M. m+1−i, m+d−i  = 2m + d − 1 by induction on d, for d ≤ 4. If j > i we use strategy A i, i+1 , obtaining .M. m, m+d  ≥ 1 + .M. i, i  + .M. m−i, m+d−i  = 2m + d − 1  by induction on m.  The first two parts of Theorem K were obtained by F. K. Hwang and S. Lin in 1969. Paul Stockmeyer and Frances Yao showed several years later that the pattern evident in these three formulas holds in general, namely that the lower bounds derived by the adversarial strategies above suffice to establish the values M m, m+d  = 2m + d − 1 for m ≥ 2d − 2. [SICOMP 9  1980 , 85–90.] Upper bounds. Now let us consider upper bounds for M m, n ; good upper bounds correspond to efficient merging algorithms.  When m = 1 the merging problem is equivalent to an insertion problem, and there are n + 1 places in which A1 might fall among B1, . . . , Bn. For this case it is easy to see that any extended binary tree with n + 1 external nodes is the tree for some merging method!  See exercise 2.  Hence we may choose an optimum binary tree, realizing the information-theoretic lower bound  1 + ⌊lg n⌋ = M 1, n  = ⌈lg n + 1 ⌉.   15   Binary search  Section 6.2.1  is, of course, a simple way to attain this value.  The case m = 2 is extremely interesting, but considerably harder. It has been solved completely by R. L. Graham, F. K. Hwang, and S. Lin  see exercises   5.3.2  MINIMUM-COMPARISON MERGING  203  11, 12, and 13 , who proved the general formula  M 2, n  =lg 7  12 n + 1  +lg 14  17 n + 1 .   16  We have seen that the usual merging procedure is optimum when m = n, while the rather different binary search procedure is optimum when m = 1. What we need is an in-between method that combines the normal merging algorithm with binary search in such a way that the best features of both are retained. Formula  14  suggests the following algorithm, due to F. K. Hwang and S. Lin [SICOMP 1  1972 , 31–39]: Algorithm H  Binary merging . H1. [If not done, choose t.] If m or n is zero, stop. Otherwise, if m > n, set H2. [Compare.] Compare Am : Bn+1−2t. If Am is smaller, set n ← n − 2t and return to step H1. H3. [Insert.] Using binary search  which requires exactly t more comparisons , insert Am into its proper place among {Bn+1−2t, . . . , Bn}. If k is maximal such that Bk < Am, set m ← m − 1 and n ← k. Return to H1. H4. [Compare.]  Steps H4 and H5 are like H2 and H3, interchanging the roles of m and n, A and B.  If Bn < Am+1−2t, set m ← m − 2t and return to step H1. H5. [Insert.] Insert Bn into its proper place among the A’s. If k is maximal  t ← ⌊lg m n ⌋ and go to step H4. Otherwise set t ← ⌊lg n m ⌋.  such that Ak < Bn, set m ← k and n ← n − 1. Return to H1. As an example of this algorithm, Table 2 shows the process of merging the three keys {087, 503, 512} with thirteen keys {061, 154, . . . , 908}; eight comparisons are required in this example. The elements compared at each step are shown in boldface type.

To calculate H m, n , we may assume that k = n in step H3 and k = m in step H5, since we shall prove that H m−1, n  ≤ H m−1, n+1    SORTING  204 for all n ≥ m − 1 by induction on m. Thus when m ≤ n we have  H m, n  = maxH m, n−2t +1, H m−1, n +t+1,  for 2tm ≤ n < 2t+1m. Replace n by 2n + ϵ, with ϵ = 0 or 1, to get  H m, 2n+ϵ  = maxH m, 2n+ϵ−2t+1  + 1, H m−1, 2n+ϵ +t+2,  for 2tm ≤ n < 2t+1m; and it follows by induction on n that  5.3.2   17   for m ≤ n and ϵ = 0 or 1.  H m, 2n+ϵ  = H m, n  + m,   18  It is also easy to see that H m, n  = m + n − 1 when m ≤ n < 2m; hence a repeated application of  18  yields the general formula for m ≤ n,   19  This implies that H m, n  ≤ H m, n+1  for all n ≥ m, verifying our inductive hypothesis about step H3.  H m, n  = m + ⌊n 2t⌋ − 1 + tm,  t = ⌊lg n m ⌋.  Setting m = αn and θ = lg n m  − t gives  H αn, n  = αn 1 + 2θ − θ − lg α  + O 1 ,   20  as n → ∞. We know by Eq. 5.3.1– 36  that 1.9139 < 1 + 2θ − θ ≤ 2; hence  20  may be compared with the information-theoretic lower bound  3 . Hwang and Lin have proved  see exercise 17  that  H m, n  <  lg  + min  m, n .   21   The Hwang–Lin binary merging algorithm does not always give optimum results, but it has the great virtue that it can be programmed rather easily. It reduces to “uncentered binary search” when m = 1, and it reduces to the usual merging procedure when m ≈ n, so it represents an excellent compromise between those two methods. Furthermore, it is optimum in many cases  see exercise 16 . Improved algorithms have been found by F. K. Hwang and D. N. Deutsch, JACM 20  1973 , 148–159; G. K. Manacher, JACM 26  1979 , 434– 440; and most notably by C. Christen, FOCS 19  1978 , 259–266. Christen’s merging procedure, called forward-testing-backward-insertion, saves about m 3 comparisons over Algorithm H when n m → ∞. Moreover, Christen’s procedure achieves the lower bound .M. m, n  = ⌊ 11m + n − 3  4⌋ when 5m − 3 ≤ n ≤ 7m + 2[m even]; hence it is optimum in such cases  and, remarkably, so is our adversarial lower bound .  Formula  18  suggests that the M function itself might satisfy   22  This is actually true  see exercise 19 . Tables of M m, n  suggest several other plausible relations, such as  M m, n  ≤ M m,⌊n 2⌋  + m.  M m+1, n  ≥ 1 + M m, n  ≥ M m, n+1 , M m+1, n + 1  ≥ 2 + M m, n ;  for m ≤ n;   23   24   but no proof of these inequalities is known.     m + n    m   5.3.2  MINIMUM-COMPARISON MERGING  205  EXERCISES 1.

Dodgson — who is of course better known as Lewis Carroll — was concerned about the unjust manner in which prizes were awarded in tennis tournaments. Consider, for example, Fig. 39, which shows a typical “knockout tournament” between 32 players labeled 01, 02, . . . , 32. In the finals, player 01 defeats player 05, so it is clear that player 01 is the champion and deserves the first prize. The inequity arises because player 05 usually gets second prize, although someone else might well be the second best. You can win second prize even if you are worse than half of the players in the competition! In fact, as Dodgson observed, the second-best player wins second prize if and only if the champion and the next-best are originally in opposite halves of the tournament; this occurs with probability 2n−1  2n −1 , when there are 2n competitors, so the wrong player receives second prize almost half of the time. If the losers of the semifinal round  players 25 and 17 in Fig. 39  compete for third prize, it is highly unlikely that the third-best player receives third prize. Dodgson therefore set out to design a tournament that determines the true second- and third-best players, assuming a transitive ranking.  In other words, if player A beats player B and B beats C, Dodgson assumed that A would beat C.  He devised a procedure in which losers are allowed to play further games until they are known to be definitely inferior to three other players. An example of Dodgson’s scheme appears in Fig. 40, which is a supplementary tournament to be run in conjunction with Fig. 39. He tried to pair off players whose records in previous rounds were equivalent; he also tried to avoid matches in which both   208  SORTING  5.3.3  players had been defeated by the same person. In this particular example, 16 loses to 11 and 13 loses to 12 in Round 1; after 13 beats 16 in the second round, we can eliminate 16, who is now known to be inferior to 11, 12, and 13. In Round 3 Dodgson did not allow 19 to play with 21, since they have both been defeated by 18 and we could not automatically eliminate the loser of 19 versus 21.

A knockout tournament with 32 players.  It would be nice to report that Lewis Carroll’s tournament turns out to be optimal, but unfortunately that is not the case. His diary entry for July 23, 1883, says that he composed the essay in about six hours, and he felt “we are now so late in the [tennis] season that it is better it should appear soon than be written well.” His procedure makes more comparisons than necessary, and it is not formulated precisely enough to qualify as an algorithm. On the other hand, it has some rather interesting aspects from the standpoint of parallel computation. And it appears to be an excellent plan for a tennis tournament, because he built in some dramatic effects; for example, he specified that the two finalists should sit out round 5, playing an extended match during rounds 6 and 7. But tournament directors presumably thought the proposal was too logical, and so Carroll’s system has apparently never been tried. Instead, a method of “seeding” is used to keep the supposedly best players in different parts of the tree.

J. Schreier [Mathesis Polska 7  1932 , 154–160] gave a procedure that requires at most n−2+⌈lg n⌉ matches, using essentially the same method as the first two stages in what we have called tree selection sorting  see Section 5.2.3, Fig. 23 , avoiding redundant comparisons that involve −∞. Schreier also claimed that n − 2 + ⌈lg n⌉ is best possible, but his proof was incorrect, as was another attempted proof by J. Słupecki [Colloquium Mathematicum 2  1951 , 286–290]. Thirty-two years went by before a correct, although rather complicated, proof was finally published by S. S. Kislitsyn [Sibirski˘ı Mat. Zhurnal 5  1964 , 557–564]. Let Vt n  denote the minimum number of comparisons needed to determine the tth largest of n elements, for 1 ≤ t ≤ n, and let Wt n  be the minimum number required to determine the largest, second largest, . . . , and the tth largest, collectively. By symmetry, we have  and it is obvious that  Vt n  = Vn+1−t n ,  V1 n  = W1 n , Vt n  ≤ Wt n , Wn n  = Wn−1 n  = S n .   1    2   3   4   We have observed in Lemma 5.2.3M that V1 n  = n − 1.   5  In fact, there is an astonishingly simple proof of this fact, since everyone in a tournament except the champion must lose at least one game! By extending this idea and using an “adversary” as in Section 5.3.2, we can prove the Schreier– Kislitsyn theorem without much difficulty: Theorem S. V2 n  = W2 n  = n − 2 + ⌈lg n⌉, for n ≥ 2. Proof. Assume that n players have participated in a tournament that has determined the second-best player by some given procedure, and let aj be the number of players who have lost j or more matches. The total number of matches played is then a1 + a2 + a3 + ··· . We cannot determine the second-best player without also determining the champion  see exercise 2 , so our previous argument shows that a1 = n − 1. To complete the proof, we will show that there is always some sequence of outcomes of the matches that makes a2 ≥ ⌈lg n⌉ − 1. Suppose that at the end of the tournament the champion has played  and beaten  p players; one of these is the second best, and the others must have lost at least one other time, so a2 ≥ p − 1. Therefore we can complete the proof by constructing an adversary who decides the results of the games in such a way that the champion must play at least ⌈lg n⌉ other people.  Let the adversary declare A to be better than B if A is previously undefeated and B has lost at least once, or if both are undefeated and B has won fewer   210  SORTING  5.3.3  matches than A at that time. In other circumstances the adversary may make an arbitrary decision consistent with some partial ordering.  Consider the outcome of a complete tournament whose matches have been decided by such an adversary. Let us say that “A supersedes B” if and only if A = B or A supersedes the player who first defeated B.  Only a player’s first defeat is relevant in this relation; a loser’s subsequent games are ignored. According to the mechanism of the adversary, any player who first defeats another must be previously unbeaten.  It follows that a player who won the first p matches supersedes at most 2p players on the basis of those p contests.  This is clear for p = 0, and for p > 0 the pth match was against someone who was either previously beaten or who supersedes at most 2p−1 players.  Hence the champion, who supersedes everyone, must have played at least ⌈lg n⌉ matches.  Theorem S completely resolves the problem of finding the second-best player, in the minimax sense. Exercise 6 shows, in fact, that it is possible to give a simple formula for the minimum number of comparisons needed to find the second largest element of a set when an arbitrary partial ordering of the elements is known beforehand. What if t >> 2? In the paper cited above, Kislitsyn went on to consider larger values of t, proving that  ⌈lg j⌉,  for 1 ≤ t ≤ n.   6   Wt n  ≤ n − t +   n+1−t<j≤n  For t = 1 and t = 2 we have seen that equality actually holds in this formula; for t = 3 it can be slightly improved  see exercise 21 .  selection require at most n − t +  We shall prove Kislitsyn’s theorem by showing that the first t stages of tree n+1−t<j≤n⌈lg j⌉ comparisons, ignoring all of the comparisons that involve −∞. It is interesting to note that, by Eq. 5.3.1– 3 , the right-hand side of  6  equals B n  when t = n, and also when t = n − 1; hence tree selection and binary insertion yield the same upper bound for the sorting problem, although they are quite different methods. Let α be an extended binary tree with n external nodes, and let π be a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Place the elements of π into the external nodes, from left to right in symmetric order, and fill in the internal nodes according to the rules of a knockout tournament as in tree selection. When the resulting tree is subjected to repeated selection operations, it defines a sequence cn−1 cn−2 . . . c1, where cj is the number of comparisons required to bring element j to the root of the tree when element j + 1 has been replaced by −∞. For example, if α is the tree   7    5.3.3  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SELECTION  211  and if π = 5 3 1 4 2, we obtain the successive trees  c4 = 1  c3 = 2  c2 = 0  c1 = 0  If π had been 3 1 5 4 2, the sequence c4 c3 c2 c1 would have been 2 1 1 0 instead. It is not difficult to see that c1 is always zero. Let µ α, π  be the multiset {cn−1, cn−2, . . . , c1} determined by α and π. If  α =  and if elements 1 and 2 do not both appear in α′ or both in α′′, it is easy to see that   8  for appropriate permutations π′ and π′′, where µ+1 denotes the multiset obtained by adding 1 to each element of µ.  See exercise 7.  On the other hand, if elements 1 and 2 both appear in α′, we have  µ α, π  =µ α′, π′  + 1 ⊎µ α′′, π′′  + 1 ⊎ {0} µ α, π  =µ α′, π′  + ϵ ⊎µ α′′, π′′  + 1 ⊎ {0},  where µ + ϵ denotes a multiset obtained by adding 1 to some elements of µ and 0 to the others. A similar formula holds when 1 and 2 both appear in α′′. Let us say that multiset µ1 dominates µ2 if both µ1 and µ2 contain the same number of elements, and if the kth largest element of µ1 is greater than or equal to the kth largest element of µ2 for all k; and let us define µ α  to be the dominant µ α, π , taken over all permutations π, in the sense that µ α  dominates µ α, π  for all π and µ α  = µ α, π  for some π. The formulas above show that    =µ α′  + 1 ⊎µ α′′  + 1 ⊎ {0};  µ     = ∅,   9   µ   cid:105    cid:19  cid:19   cid:83  cid:83  α′ α′′  hence µ α  is the multiset of all distances from the root to the internal nodes of α. The reader who has followed this train of thought will now see that we are ready to prove Kislitsyn’s theorem  6 . Indeed, Wt n  is less than or equal to n − 1 plus the t − 1 largest elements of µ α , where α is any tree being used in tree selection sorting. We may take α to be the complete binary tree with n external nodes  see Section 2.3.4.5 , when  µ α  =⌊lg 1⌋,⌊lg 2⌋, . . . ,⌊lg n−1 ⌋  =⌈lg 2⌉−1,⌈lg 3⌉−1, . . . ,⌈lg n⌉−1.   10  Formula  6  follows when we consider the t − 1 largest elements of this multiset.  5  5  4  5  3  4  2  1  4  4  3  4  4  2  1  4  3  3  2  1  2  2  1  2  1  α′  α′′   212  SORTING  5.3.3  n ≥ t,  Kislitsyn’s theorem gives a good upper bound for Wt n ; he remarked that V3 5  = 6 < W3 5  = 7, but he was unable to find a better bound for Vt n  than for Wt n . A. Hadian and M. Sobel discovered a way to do this using replacement selection instead of tree selection; their formula [Univ. of Minnesota, Dept. of Statistics Report 121  1969 ],  Vt n  ≤ n − t +  t − 1 lg n + 2 − t ,   11  is similar to Kislitsyn’s upper bound for Wt n  in  6 , except that each term in the sum has been replaced by the smallest term. Hadian and Sobel’s theorem  11  can be proved by using the following construction: First set up a binary tree for a knockout tournament on n − t + 2 items.  This takes n − t + 1 comparisons.  The largest item is greater than n − t + 1 others, so it can’t be tth largest. Replace it, where it appears at an external node of the tree, by one of the t − 2 elements held in reserve, and find  the largest element of the resulting n− t+2; this requires at mostlg n+2− t  n + 1 − t; this requires at most lg n + 2 − t  − 1 comparisons, and it brings  comparisons, because we need to recompute only one path in the tree. Repeat this operation t−2 times in all, for each element held in reserve. Finally, replace the currently largest element by −∞, and determine the largest of the remaining  the tth largest element of the original set to the root of the tree. Summing the comparisons yields  11 . In relation  11  we should of course replace t by n + 1 − t on the right-hand side whenever n+1−t gives a better value  as when n = 6 and t = 3 . Curiously, the formula gives a smaller bound for V7 13  than it does for V6 13 . The upper bound in  11  is exact for n ≤ 6, but as n and t get larger it is possible to obtain much better estimates of Vt n . For example, the following elegant method  due to David G. Doren  can be used to show that V4 8  ≤ 12. Let the elements be X1, . . . , X8; first compare X1 : X2 and X3 : X4 and the two winners, and do the same to X5 : X6 and X7 : X8 and their winners. Relabel elements so that X1   X3, X5 < X6 < X8 > X7, then compare X2 : X6; by symmetry assume that X2 < X6, so that we have the configuration   Now X1 and X8 are out of contention and we must find the third largest of {X2, . . . , X7}.  Compare X2 : X7, and discard the smaller; in the worst case we have X2 < X7 and we must find the third largest of  This can be done in V3 5  − 2 = 4 more steps, since the procedure of  11  that achieves V3 5  = 6 begins by comparing two disjoint pairs of elements.  5  6  8  7  1  2  4  3  5  3  6  4  7   5.3.3  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SELECTION Table 1  213  VALUES OF Vt n  FOR SMALL n  V1 n  V2 n  V3 n  V4 n  V5 n  V6 n  V7 n  V8 n  V9 n  V10 n   n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  1 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 12  2 4 6 8 10 11 12 14∗  3 6 8 10∗ 12 14 15  4 7 10 12 14∗ 16∗∗  5 8 11 14 16∗∗  6 9 12 15  7 11 14∗  8 12  9  ∗ Exercises 10–12 give constructions that improve on Eq.  11  in these cases. ∗∗ See K. Noshita, Trans. of the IECE of Japan E59, 12  December 1976 , 17–18.  Other tricks of this kind can be used to produce the results shown in Table 1; no general method is evident as yet. The values listed for V4 9  = V6 9  and V5 10  = V6 10  were proved optimum in 1996 by W. Gasarch, W. Kelly, and W. Pugh [SIGACT News 27, 2  June 1996 , 88–96], using a computer search.  A fairly good lower bound for the selection problem when t is small was If 2 ≤ t ≤  obtained by David G. Kirkpatrick [JACM 28  1981 , 150–165]:  n + 1  2, we have  t−2  j=0    .   lg n − t + 2 t + j    Vt n  ≥ n + t − 3 +   12   +    lg n − 1 4  V3 n  ≤ n + 1 +  In his Ph.D. thesis [U. of Toronto, 1974], Kirkpatrick also proved that   lg n − 1  13  5 3 ≈ 74% of all integers n, this upper bound matches the lower bound  12  for lg 5 and it exceeds  12  by at most 1. Kirkpatrick’s analysis made it natural to conjecture that equality holds in  13  for all n > 4, but Jutta Eusterbrock found the surprising counterexample V3 22  = 28 [Discrete Applied Math. 41  1993 , 131–137]. Then Kirkpatrick discovered that V3 42  = 50; this may well be the only other counterexample [see Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 8066  2013 , 61–76]. Improved lower bounds for larger values of t were found by S. W. Bent and J. W. John  see exercise 27 :  ;  m,  Vt n  ≥ n + m − 2√ Vαn n  ≥  This formula proves in particular that  m = 2 +lg n  t    n + 1 − t   n + O√ n.  .   14    15   1 + α lg 1  α  +  1 − α  lg  1  1 − α   SORTING  214 5.3.3 A linear method. When n is odd and t = ⌈n 2⌉, the tth largest  and tth smallest  element is called the median. According to  11 , we can find the median of n elements in ≈ 1 2 n lg n comparisons; but this is only about twice as fast as sorting, even though we are asking for much less information. For several years, concerted efforts were made by a number of people to find an improvement over  11  when t and n are large. Finally in 1971, Manuel Blum discovered a method that needed only O n log log n  steps. Blum’s approach to the problem suggested a new class of techniques, which led to the following construction due to R. Rivest and R. Tarjan [J. Comp. and Sys. Sci. 7  1973 , 448–461]: Theorem L. If n > 32 and 1 ≤ t ≤ n, we have Vt n  ≤ 15n − 163. Proof. The theorem is trivial when n is small, since Vt n  ≤ S n  ≤ 10n ≤ 15n − 163 for 32 < n ≤ 210. By adding at most 13 dummy −∞ elements, we may assume that n = 7 2q + 1  for some integer q ≥ 73. The following method may now be used to select the tth largest: Step 1. Divide the elements into 2q + 1 groups of seven elements each, and sort each of the groups. This takes at most 13 2q + 1  comparisons. Step 2. Find the median of the 2q + 1 median elements obtained in Step 1, and call it x. By induction on q, this takes at most Vq+1 2q + 1  ≤ 30q − 148 comparisons. Step 3. The n − 1 elements other than x have now been partitioned into three sets  see Fig. 41 :  4q + 3 elements known to be greater than x  Region B ; 4q + 3 elements known to be less than x  Region C ; 6q elements whose relation to x is unknown  Regions A and D .  By making 4q additional comparisons, we can tell exactly which of the elements in regions A and D are less than x.  We first test x against the middle element of each triple.  Step 4. We have now found r elements greater than x and n − 1 − r elements less than x, for some r. If t = r + 1, x is the answer; if t < r + 1, we need to find the tth largest of the r large elements; and if t > r + 1, we need to find the  t−1−r th largest of the n − 1 − r small elements. The point is that r and n − 1 − r are both less than or equal to 10q + 3  the size of regions A and D, plus either B or C . By induction on q this step therefore requires at most 15 10q + 3  − 163 comparisons.  The total number of comparisons comes to at most 13 2q + 1  + 30q − 148 + 4q + 15 10q + 3  − 163 = 15 14q − 6  − 163.  Since we started with at least 14q − 6 elements, the proof is complete.  Theorem L shows that selection can always be done in linear time, namely that Vt n  = O n . Of course, the method used in this proof is rather crude, since it throws away good information in Step 4. Deeper study of the problem   5.3.3  MINIMUM-COMPARISON SELECTION  215  Fig. 41. The selection algorithm of Rivest and Tarjan  q = 4 .  has led to much sharper bounds; for example, A. Schönhage, M. Paterson, and N. Pippenger [J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 13  1976 , 184–199] proved that the maximum number of comparisons required to find the median is at most 3n+O n log n 3 4. See exercise 23 for a lower bound and for references to more recent results. The average number. Instead of minimizing the maximum number of compar- isons, we can ask instead for an algorithm that minimizes the average number of comparisons, assuming random order. As usual, the minimean problem is considerably harder than the minimax problem; indeed, the minimean problem is still unsolved even in the case t = 2. Claude Picard mentioned the problem in his book Théorie des Questionnaires  1965 , and an extensive exploration was undertaken by Milton Sobel [Univ. of Minnesota, Dept. of Statistics Reports 113 and 114  November 1968 ; Revue Française d’Automatique, Informatique et Recherche Opérationnelle 6, R-3  December 1972 , 23–68].  Sobel constructed the procedure of Fig. 42, which finds the second largest of six elements using only 6 1 2 comparisons on the average. In the worst case, 8 comparisons are required, and this is worse than V2 6  = 7; in fact, an exhaustive computer search by D. Hoey has shown that the best procedure for this problem, if restricted to at most 7 comparisons, uses 6 26 45 comparisons on the average. Thus no procedure that finds the second largest of six elements can be optimum in both the minimax and the minimean senses simultaneously.  Let V t n  denote the minimum average number of comparisons needed to find the tth largest of n elements. Table 2 shows the exact values for small n, as computed by D. Hoey.  R. W. Floyd discovered in 1970 that the median of n elements can be found with only 3 2 n + O n2 3 log n  comparisons, on the average. He and R. L. Rivest refined this method a few years later and constructed an elegant algorithm to prove that  16   V t n  ≤ n + min t, n−t  + O√  n log n.

Each “symmetrical” branch is identical to its sibling, with names permuted in some appropriate manner. External nodes contain “j k” when Xj is known to be the second largest and Xk the largest; the number of permutations leading to such a node appears immediately below it.  Using another approach, based on a generalization of one of Sobel’s construc- tions for t = 2, David W. Matula [Washington Univ. Tech. Report AMCS-73-9  1973 ] showed that   17  Thus, for fixed t the average amount of work can be reduced to n + O log log n  comparisons. An elegant lower bound on V t n  appears in exercise 25.  V t n  ≤ n + t⌈lg t⌉ 11 + ln ln n .  The sorting and selection problems are special cases of the much more general problem of finding a permutation of n given elements that is consistent with a given partial ordering. A. C. Yao [SICOMP 18  1989 , 679–689] has shown that, if the partial ordering is defined by an acyclic digraph G on n vertices with k connected components, the minimum number of comparisons  necessary to solve such problems is always Θlgn!

Networks for Sorting In this section we shall study a constrained type of sorting that is particularly interesting because of its applications and its rich underlying theory. The new constraint is to insist on an oblivious sequence of comparisons, in the sense that whenever we compare Ki versus Kj the subsequent comparisons for the case Ki   Kj, but with i and j interchanged.  Figure 43 a  shows a comparison tree in which this homogeneity condition is satisfied. Notice that every level has the same number of comparisons, so there are 2m outcomes after m comparisons have been made. But n! is not a power of 2; some of the comparisons must therefore be redundant, in the sense that   2 2 0  S O R T N G  I  5 . 3 . 4  Fig. 43.  a  An oblivious comparison tree.   b  The corresponding network.

In other words, some branches of the tree must make more comparisons than necessary, in order to ensure that all of the corresponding branches of the tree will sort properly.  Since each path from top to bottom of such a tree determines the entire tree, such a sorting scheme is most easily represented as a network; see Fig. 43 b . The boxes in such a network represent “comparator modules” that have two inputs  represented as lines coming into the module from above  and two outputs  represented as lines leading downward ; the left-hand output is the smaller of the two inputs, and the right-hand output is the larger. At the bottom of the network, K′1 is the smallest of {K1, K2, K3, K4}, K′2 the second smallest, etc. It is not difficult to prove that any sorting network corresponds to an oblivious comparison tree in the sense above, and that any oblivious tree corresponds to a network of comparator modules.  Incidentally, we may note that comparator modules are fairly easy to manu- facture, from an engineering point of view. For example, assume that the lines contain binary numbers, where one bit enters each module per unit time, most significant bit first. Each comparator module has three states, and behaves as follows:  Time t  State  Time  t + 1  State Outputs  Inputs 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 x y x y  0 0 0 0 1 2  0 1 2 0 1 2  0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 x y y x  Initially all modules are in state 0 and are outputting 0 0. A module enters either state 1 or state 2 as soon as its inputs differ. Numbers that begin to be transmitted at the top of Fig. 43 b  at time t will begin to be output at the bottom, in sorted order, at time t + 3, if a suitable delay element is attached to the K′1 and K′4 lines.  Fig. 44. Another way to rep- resent the network of Fig. 43, as it sorts the sequence of four numbers ⟨4, 1, 3, 2⟩.  In order to develop the theory of sorting networks it is convenient to repre- sent them in a slightly different way, illustrated in Fig. 44. Here numbers enter at the left, and comparator modules are represented by vertical connections between two lines; each comparator causes an interchange of its inputs, if necessary, so that the larger number sinks to the lower line after passing the comparator. At the right of the diagram all the numbers are in order from top to bottom.

In this respect sorting networks have obvious advantages, since the data can be maintained in n locations and the decision structure is “straight line” — there is no need to remember the results of previous comparisons, since the plan is immutably fixed in advance. Another important advantage of sorting networks is that we can usually overlap several of the operations, performing them simul- taneously  on a suitable machine . For example, the five steps in Figs. 43 and 44 can be collapsed into three when simultaneous nonoverlapping comparisons are allowed, since the first two and the second two can be combined. We shall exploit this property of sorting networks later in this section. Thus sorting networks can be very useful, although it is not at all obvious that efficient n-element sorting networks can be constructed for large n; we may find that many additional comparisons are needed in order to keep the decision structure oblivious.   a    b   Fig. 45. Making  n + 1 -sorters from n-sorters:  a  insertion,  b  selection. There are two simple ways to construct a sorting network for n + 1 elements when an n-element network is given, using either the principle of insertion or the principle of selection. Figure 45 a  shows how the  n + 1 st element can be inserted into its proper place after the first n elements have been sorted; and part  b  of the figure shows how the largest element can be selected before we proceed to sort the remaining ones. Repeated application of Fig. 45 a  gives the network analog of straight insertion sorting  Algorithm 5.2.1S , and repeated application of Fig. 45 b  yields the network analog of the bubble sort  Algorithm 5.2.2B . Figure 46 shows the corresponding six-element networks.   a    b   Fig. 46.

With parallelism, straight insertion = bubble sort!  Notice that when we collapse either network together to allow simultaneous operations, both methods actually reduce to the same “triangular”  2n − 3 - stage procedure  Fig. 47 .  It is easy to prove that the network of Figs. 43 and 44 will sort any set of four numbers into order, since the first four comparators route the smallest and the largest elements to the correct places, and the last comparator puts the remaining two elements in order. But it is not always so easy to tell whether or not a given network will sort all possible input sequences; for example, both  and  are valid 4-element sorting networks, but the proofs of their validity are not triv- ial. It would be sufficient to test each n-element network on all n! permutations of n distinct numbers, but in fact we can get by with far fewer tests: Theorem Z  Zero-one principle . If a network with n input lines sorts all 2n sequences of 0s and 1s into nondecreasing order, it will sort any arbitrary sequence of n numbers into nondecreasing order. Proof.  This is a special case of Bouricius’s theorem, exercise 5.3.1–12.  If f x  is any monotonic function, with f x  ≤ f y  whenever x ≤ y, and if a given network transforms ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩ into ⟨y1, . . . , yn⟩, then it is easy to see that the network will transform ⟨f x1 , . . . , f xn ⟩ into ⟨f y1 , . . . , f yn ⟩. If yi > yi+1 for some i, consider the monotonic function f that takes all numbers < yi into 0 and all numbers ≥ yi into 1; this defines a sequence ⟨f x1 , . . . , f xn ⟩ of 0s and 1s that is not sorted by the network. Hence if all 0–1 sequences are sorted, we have yi ≤ yi+1 for 1 ≤ i < n.  The zero-one principle is quite helpful in the construction of sorting net- works. As a nontrivial example, we can derive a generalized version of Batcher’s “merge exchange” sort  Algorithm 5.2.2M . The idea is to sort m+n elements by  i  sorting the first m and the last n independently, then  ii  applying an  m, n - merging network to the result. An  m, n -merging network can be constructed inductively as follows: a  If m = 0 or n = 0, the network is empty. If m = n = 1, the network is a single comparator module. b  If mn > 1, let the sequences to be merged be ⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩ and ⟨y1, . . . , yn⟩. Merge the “odd sequences” ⟨x1, x3, . . . , x2⌈m 2⌉−1⟩ and ⟨y1, y3, . . . , y2⌈n 2⌉−1⟩,   224  SORTING  5.3.4  Fig. 48.

Finally, apply the comparison-interchange  w1 : v2, w2 : v3, w3 : v4,  . . . , w⌊m 2⌋+⌊n 2⌋  : v∗   1   to the sequence  ⟨v1, w1, v2, w2, v3, w3, . . . , v⌊m 2⌋+⌊n 2⌋, w⌊m 2⌋+⌊n 2⌋, v∗, v∗∗⟩;   2  the result will be sorted ! . Here v∗ = v⌊m 2⌋+⌊n 2⌋+1 does not exist if both m and n are even, and v∗∗ = v⌊m 2⌋+⌊n 2⌋+2 does not exist unless both m and n are odd; the total number of comparator modules indicated in  1  is ⌊ m+ n−1  2⌋. Batcher’s  m, n -merging network is called the odd-even merge. A  4, 7 -merge constructed according to these principles is illustrated in Fig. 48.  To prove that this rather strange merging procedure actually works, when mn > 1, we use the zero-one principle, testing it on all sequences of 0s and 1s. After the initial m-sort and n-sort, the sequence ⟨x1, . . . , xm⟩ will consist of k 0s followed by m − k 1s, and the sequence ⟨y1, . . . , yn⟩ will be l 0s followed by n− l 1s, for some k and l. Hence the sequence ⟨v1, v2, . . .⟩ will consist of exactly ⌈k 2⌉ + ⌈l 2⌉ 0s, followed by 1s; and ⟨w1, w2, . . .⟩ will consist of ⌊k 2⌋ + ⌊l 2⌋ 0s, followed by 1s. Now here’s the point:  ⌈k 2⌉ + ⌈l 2⌉ −⌊k 2⌋ + ⌊l 2⌋ = 0, 1, or 2.   3  If this difference is 0 or 1, the sequence  2  is already in order, and if the difference is 2 one of the comparison-interchanges in  1  will fix everything up. This completes the proof.  Note that the zero-one principle reduces the merging   cases to only  m + 1  n + 1 , represented  problem from a consideration ofm+n  by the two parameters k and l.   m  Let C m, n  be the number of comparator modules used in the odd-even  merge for m and n, not counting the initial m-sort and n-sort; we have   mn, C⌈m 2⌉,⌈n 2⌉+C⌊m 2⌋,⌊n 2⌋+ m+n−1  2,  C m, n  =  if mn ≤ 1; if mn > 1.  4   x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7  d e t r o  S   d e t r o S  v1  v2  v3  v4  v5  v6  w1  w2  w3  w4  w5  d e t r o S  z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 z6 z7 z8 z9 z10 z11     5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  225  This is not an especially simple function of m and n, in general, but by noting that C 1, n  = n and that  C m + 1, n + 1  − C m, n   = 1 + C⌊m 2⌋ + 1,⌊n 2⌋ + 1 − C⌊m 2⌋,⌊n 2⌋,  if mn ≥ 1,  we can derive the relation  C m + 1, n + 1  − C m, n  = ⌊lg m⌋ + 2 + ⌊n 2⌊lg m⌋+1⌋,  if n ≥ m ≥ 1.   5   Consequently  C m, m + r  = B m  + m + Rm r ,  where B m  is the “binary insertion” functionm   r + 4  r + 0   r + 3   r + 1   r + 2  where Rm r  denotes the sum of the first m terms of the series   r + j  for m ≥ 0 and r ≥ 0,  6  k=1⌈lg k⌉ of Eq. 5.3.1– 3 , and            1  +  2  +  4  +  4  +  8  +··· .  7   +··· +  2⌊lg j⌋+1  In particular, when r = 0 we have the important special case  C m, m  = B m  + m.   8   Furthermore if t = ⌈lg m⌉,  Rm r + 2t  = Rm r  + 1 · 2t−1 + 2 · 2t−2 + ··· + 2t−1 · 20 + m  = Rm r  + m + t · 2t−1.

As n → ∞ we have C n, n  = n lg n + O n , by Eq.  8  and exercise 5.3.1–15. Minimum-comparison networks. Let ˆS n  be the minimum number of comparators needed in a sorting network for n elements; clearly ˆS n  ≥ S n , where S n  is the minimum number of comparisons needed in a not-necessarily- oblivious sorting procedure  see Section 5.3.1 . We have ˆS 4  = 5 = S 4 , so the new constraint causes no loss of efficiency when n = 4; but already when n = 5 it turns out that ˆS 5  = 9 while S 5  = 7. The problem of determining ˆS n  seems to be even harder than the problem of determining S n ; even the asymptotic behavior of ˆS n  is known only in a very weak sense.  It is interesting to trace the history of this problem, since each step was forged with some difficulty. Sorting networks were first explored by P. N. Arm- strong, R. J. Nelson, and D. G. O’Connor, about 1954 [see U.S. Patent 3029413]; in the words of their patent attorney, “By the use of skill, it is possible to design economical n-line sorting switches using a reduced number of two-line sorting switches.” After observing that ˆS n + 1  ≤ ˆS n  + n, they gave special constructions for 4 ≤ n ≤ 8, using 5, 9, 12, 18, and 19 comparators, respectively.     t 2 + m 2t   SORTING  226 5.3.4 Then Nelson worked together with R. C. Bose to show that ˆS 2n  ≤ 3n − 2n for all n; hence ˆS n  = O nlg 3  = O n1.585 . Bose and Nelson published their interesting method in JACM 9  1962 , 282–296, where they conjectured that it was best possible; T. N. Hibbard [JACM 10  1963 , 142–150] found a similar but slightly simpler construction that used the same number of comparisons, thereby reinforcing the conjecture.  problem, leading to an asymptotic bound of the form ˆS n  = On1+c √log n.  In 1964, R. W. Floyd and D. E. Knuth found a new way to approach the  Working independently, K. E. Batcher discovered the general merging strategy outlined above.

AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conf. 32  1968 , 307–314]. Several people have found ways to reduce the number of comparators used by Batcher’s merge-exchange construction; the following table shows the best upper bounds currently known for ˆS n : 8  n = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 c n  = 0 1 3 5 9 12 16 19 26 31 37 41 48 53 59 63 ˆS n  ≤ 0 1 3 5 9 12 16 19 25 29 35 39 45 51 56 60   11   Since ˆS n    8. When n ≤ 8, merge exchange uses the same number of comparators as the construction of Bose and Nelson. Floyd and Knuth proved in 1964–1966 that the values listed for ˆS n  are exact when n ≤ 8 [see A Survey of Combinatorial Theory  North-Holland, 1973 , 163–172]; M. Codish, L. Cruz-Filipe, M. Frank, and P. Schneider-Kamp [arXiv:1405.5754 [cs.DM]  2014 , 17 pages] have also verified this when n ≤ 10. The remaining values of ˆS n  are still not known.  Constructions that lead to the values in  11  are shown in Fig. 49. The network for n = 9, based on an interesting three-way merge, was found by R. W. Floyd in 1964; its validity can be established by using the general principle described in exercise 27. The network for n = 10 was discovered by A. Waksman in 1969, by regarding the inputs as permutations of {1, 2, . . . , 10} and trying to reduce as much as possible the number of values that can appear on each line at a given stage, while maintaining some symmetry.  The network shown for n = 13 has quite a different pedigree: Hugues Juillé [Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 929  1995 , 246–260] used a computer program to construct it, by simulating an evolutionary process of genetic breeding. The network exhibits no obvious rhyme or reason, but it works — and it’s shorter than any other construction devised so far by human ratiocination.  A 62-comparator sorting network for 16 elements was found by G. Shapiro in 1969, and this was rather surprising since Batcher’s method  63 comparisons    5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  227  Fig. 49. Efficient sorting networks.  would appear to be at its best when n is a power of 2. Soon after hearing of Shapiro’s construction, M. W. Green tripled the amount of surprise by finding the 60-comparison sorter in Fig. 49. The first portion of Green’s construction is fairly easy to understand; after the 32 comparison interchanges to the left of the dotted line have been made, the lines can be labeled with the 16 subsets of {a, b, c, d}, in such a way that the line labeled s is known to contain a number less than or equal to the contents of the line labeled t whenever s is a subset of t. The state of the sort at this point is discussed further in exercise 32. Comparisons made on subsequent levels of Green’s network become increasingly mysterious, however, and as yet nobody has seen how to generalize the construction in order to obtain correspondingly efficient networks for higher values of n.  Shapiro and Green also discovered the network shown for n = 12. When n = 11, 14, or 15, good networks can be found by removing the bottom line of the network for n + 1, together with all comparators touching that line.  n = 9  25 modules, delay 9  n = 10  29 modules, delay 9  n = 12  39 modules, delay 9  n = 13  45 modules, delay 10  n = 16  60 modules, delay 10   228  SORTING  5.3.4  The best sorting network currently known for 256 elements, due to D. Van Voorhis, shows that ˆS 256  ≤ 3651, compared to 3839 by Batcher’s method. [See R. L. Drysdale and F. H. Young, SICOMP 4  1975 , 264–270.] As n → ∞, it turns out in fact that ˆS n  = O n log n ; this astonishing upper bound was proved by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi in Combinatorica 3  1983 , 1–19. The networks they constructed are not of practical interest, since many comparators were introduced just to save a factor of log n; Batcher’s method is much better, unless n exceeds the total memory capacity of all computers on earth! But the theorem of Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi does establish the true asymptotic growth rate of ˆS n , up to a constant factor. Minimum-time networks. In physical realizations of sorting networks, and on parallel computers, it is possible to do nonoverlapping comparison-exchanges at the same time; therefore it is natural to try to minimize the delay time. A moment’s reflection shows that the delay time of a sorting network is equal to the maximum number of comparators in contact with any “path” through the network, if we define a path to consist of any left-to-right route that possibly switches lines at the comparators. We can put a sequence number on each comparator indicating the earliest time it can be executed; this is one higher than the maximum of the sequence numbers of the comparators that occur earlier on its input lines.  See Fig. 50 a ; part  b  of the figure shows the same network redrawn so that each comparison is done at the earliest possible moment.    a    b  Fig. 50. Doing each comparison at the earliest possible time.  Batcher’s odd-even merging network described above takes TB m, n  units  of time, where TB m, 0  = TB 0, n  = 0, TB 1, 1  = 1, and  TB m, n  = 1 + maxTB ⌊m 2⌋,⌊n 2⌋ , TB ⌈m 2⌉,⌈n 2⌉   We can use these relations to prove that TB m, n+1  ≥ TB m, n , by induction; hence TB m, n  = 1 + TB  ⌈m 2⌉,⌈n 2⌉ for mn ≥ 2, and it follows that  for mn ≥ 2.

Still smaller delay time can be achieved if we add one or two extra comparator modules, as shown in the remarkable networks for n = 10, 12, and 16 in Fig. 51.

Let ˆM m, n  denote the minimum number of comparator modules needed in a network that merges m elements x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xm with n elements y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn to form the sorted sequence z1 ≤ ··· ≤ zm+n. At present no merging networks have been discovered that are superior to the odd-even merge described above; hence the function C m, n  in  6  represents the best upper bound known for ˆM m, n .  R. W. Floyd has discovered an interesting way to find lower bounds for this  merging problem. Theorem F. For all n ≥ 1, we have ˆM 2n, 2n  ≥ 2 ˆM n, n  + n. Proof. Consider a network with ˆM 2n, 2n  comparator modules, capable of min zi, zj , max zi, zj , for some i < j  see exercise 16 . The comparators can sorting all input sequences ⟨z1, . . . , z4n⟩ such that z1 ≤ z3 ≤ ··· ≤ z4n−1 and z2 ≤ z4 ≤ ··· ≤ z4n. We may assume that each module replaces  zi, zj  by therefore be divided into three classes: a  i ≤ 2n and j ≤ 2n. b  i > 2n and j > 2n. c  i ≤ 2n and j > 2n. Class  a  must contain at least ˆM n, n  comparators, since z2n+1, z2n+2, . . . , z4n may be already in their final position when the merge starts; similarly, there are at least ˆM n, n  comparators in class  b . Furthermore the input sequence ⟨0, 1, 0, 1, . . . , 0, 1⟩ shows that class  c  contains at least n comparators, since n zeros must move from {z2n+1, . . . , z4n} to {z1, . . . , z2n}.  Repeated use of Theorem F proves that ˆM 2m, 2m  ≥ 1  2 m + 2 2m; hence ˆM n, n  ≥ 1 2 n lg n+ O n . We know from Theorem 5.3.2M that merging without the network restriction requires only M n, n  = 2n − 1 comparisons; hence we have proved that merging with networks is intrinsically harder than merging in general.  The odd-even merge shows that ˆM m, n  ≤ C m, n  = 1  2 m + n  lg min m, n  + O m + n .  ˆM m, n  ≥ 1 2  P. B. Miltersen, M. Paterson, and J. Tarui [JACM 43  1996 , 147–165] have improved Theorem F by establishing the lower bound   m + n  lg m + 1  − m ln 2  Consequently ˆM m, n  = 1  2 m + n  lg min m, n  + O m + n .  The exact formula ˆM 2, n  = C 2, n  = 3 2 n has been proved by A. C. Yao in Eq.  12  that the odd-even merge uses lg 2n  units of delay time, when  and F. F. Yao [JACM 23  1976 , 566–571]. The value of ˆM m, n  is also known to equal C m, n  for m = n ≤ 5; see exercise 9. Bitonic sorting. When simultaneous comparisons are allowed, we have seen 1 ≤ m ≤ n. Batcher has devised another type of network for merging, called a  for 1 ≤ m ≤ n.   5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  231  bitonic sorter, which lowers the delay time tolg m + n  although it requires  Fig. 52. Batcher’s bitonic sorter of order 7.  more comparator modules. [See U.S. Patent 3428946  1969 .] Let us say that a sequence ⟨z1, . . . , zp⟩ of p numbers is bitonic if z1 ≥ ··· ≥ zk ≤ ··· ≤ zp for some k, 1 ≤ k ≤ p.  Compare this with the ordinary definition of “monotonic” sequences.  A bitonic sorter of order p is a comparator network that is capable of sorting any bitonic sequence of length p into nondecreasing order. The problem of merging x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xm with y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn is a special case of the bitonic sorting problem, since merging can be done by applying a bitonic sorter of order m + n to the sequence ⟨xm, . . . , x1, y1, . . . , yn⟩. Notice that when a sequence ⟨z1, . . . , zp⟩ is bitonic, so are all of its sub- sequences. Shortly after Batcher discovered the odd-even merging networks, he observed that we can construct a bitonic sorter of order p in an analogous way, by first sorting the bitonic subsequences ⟨z1, z3, z5, . . .⟩ and ⟨z2, z4, z6, . . .⟩ inde- pendently, then comparing and interchanging z1 : z2, z3 : z4, . . . .  See exercise 10 for a proof.  If C′ p  is the corresponding number of comparator modules, we have  C′ p  = C′⌈p 2⌉ + C′⌊p 2⌋ + ⌊p 2⌋,   15  and the delay time is clearly ⌈lg p⌉. Figure 52 shows the bitonic sorter of order 7 constructed in this way: It can be used as a  3, 4 - as well as a  2, 5 -merging network, with three units of delay; the odd-even merge for m = 2 and n = 5 saves one comparator but adds one more level of delay. Batcher’s bitonic sorter of order 2t is particularly interesting; it consists of t levels of 2t−1 comparators each. If we number the input lines z0, z1, . . . , z2t−1, element zi is compared to zj on level l if and only if i and j differ only in the lth most significant bit of their binary representations. This simple structure leads to parallel sorting networks that are as fast as merge exchange, Algorithm 5.2.2M, but considerably easier to implement.  See exercises 11 and 13.   based on simultaneous disjoint comparisons can sort in fewer thanlg m + n   Bitonic merging is optimum, in the sense that no parallel merging method  stages, whether it works obliviously or not.  See exercise 46.  Another way to achieve this optimum time, with fewer comparisons but a slightly more compli- cated control logic, is discussed in exercise 57. When 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the nth smallest output of an  m, n -merging network depends on 2m + [m < n] of the inputs  see exercise 29 . If it can be computed by comparators with l levels of delay, it involves at most 2l of the inputs; hence  2l ≥ 2m + [m < n], and l ≥ lg 2m + [m < n] . Batcher has shown [Report  GER-14122  Akron, Ohio: Goodyear Aerospace Corporation, 1968 ] that this  for p ≥ 2;  z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 z6 z7   232  SORTING  5.3.4  Fig. 53. Merging one item with six others, with multiple fanout, in order to achieve the minimum possible delay time.  minimum delay time is achievable if we allow “multiple fanout” in the network, namely the splitting of lines so that the same number is fed to many modules at once. For example, one of his networks, capable of merging one item with n others after only two levels of delay, is illustrated for n = 6 in Fig. 53. Of course, networks with multiple fanout do not conform to our conventions, and it is fairly easy to see that any  1, n -merging network without multiple fanout must have a delay time of lg n + 1  or more.  See exercise 45.  Selection networks. We can also use networks to approach the problem of Section 5.3.3. Let ˆUt n  denote the minimum number of comparators required in a network that moves the t largest of n distinct inputs into t specified output lines; the numbers are allowed to appear in any order on these output lines. Let ˆVt n  denote the minimum number of comparators required to move the tth largest of n distinct inputs into a specified output line; and let ˆWt n  denote the minimum number of comparators required to move the t largest of n distinct inputs into t specified output lines in nondecreasing order. It is not difficult to deduce  see exercise 17  that  ˆUt n  ≤ ˆVt n  ≤ ˆWt n .   16  Suppose first that we have 2t elements ⟨x1, . . . , x2t⟩ and we wish to select the largest t. V. E. Alekseev [Kibernetika 5, 5  1969 , 99–103] has observed that we can do the job by first sorting ⟨x1, . . . , xt⟩ and ⟨xt+1, . . . , x2t⟩, then comparing and interchanging  x1 : x2t,  x2 : x2t−1,   17  Since none of these pairs can contain more than one of the largest t elements  why? , Alekseev’s procedure must select the largest t elements. procedure n − 1 times, eliminating t elements each time; hence  If we want to select the t largest of nt elements, we can apply Alekseev’s  xt : xt+1.  . . . ,  ˆUt nt  ≤  n − 1 2ˆS t  + t.   18   x1  y1  y2  y3  y4  y5  y6  z1 z2  z3  z4  z5  z6 z7   5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  233  Fig. 54.

It is most convenient to consider the equivalent problem of selecting the smallest t elements. We can attach numbers  l, u  to each line of a comparator network, as shown in Fig. 54, where l and u denote respectively the minimum and maximum values that can appear at that position when the input is a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let li and lj be the lower bounds on lines i and j before a comparison of xi :xj, and let l′i and l′j be the corresponding lower bounds after the comparison. It is obvious that l′i = min li, lj ; exercise 24 proves the  nonobvious  relation  l′j ≤ li + lj.   19   Fig. 55. Another interpretation for the network of Fig. 54.  Now let us reinterpret the network operations in another way  see Fig. 55 : All input lines are assumed to contain zero, and each “comparator” now places the smaller of its inputs on the upper line and the larger plus one on the lower line.

Pippenger [SICOMP 20  1991 , 878– 887] has proved by nonconstructive methods that for any ϵ > 0 there exist  n  ≤  2+ ϵ n lg n, whenever n is sufficiently large selection networks with ˆU⌈n 2⌉  depending on ϵ .  EXERCISES — First Set Several of the following exercises develop the theory of sorting networks in detail, and it is convenient to introduce some notation. We let [i: j] stand for a comparison  interchange module. A network with n inputs and r comparator modules is written [i1 :j1][i2 :j2] . . . [ir :jr], where each of the i’s and j’s is ≤ n; we shall call it an n-network for short. A network is called standard if iq < jq for 1 ≤ q ≤ r. Thus, for example, Fig. 44 on page 221 depicts a standard 4-network, denoted by the comparator sequence [1:2][3:4][1:3][2:4][2:3].  The text’s convention for drawing network diagrams represents only standard networks; all comparators [i:j] are represented by a line from i to j, where i < j. When nonstandard networks must be drawn, we can use an arrow from i to j, indicating that the larger number goes to the point of the arrow. For example, Fig. 56 illustrates a nonstandard network for 16 elements, whose comparators are [1:2][4:3][5:6][8:7] . . . . Exercise 11 proves that Fig. 56 is a sorting network. If x = ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩ is an n-vector and α is an n-network, we write xα for the vector of numbers ⟨ xα 1, . . . ,  xα n⟩ produced by the network. For brevity, we also let a∨b = max a, b , a∧b = min a, b , ¯a = 1−a. Thus  x[i:j] i = xi∧xj,  x[i:j] j = xi∨xj,   5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  235  Fig. 56. A nonstandard sorting network based on bitonic sorting.  and  x[i: j] k = xk when i ̸= k ̸= j. We say α is a sorting network if  xα i ≤  xα i+1 for all x and for 1 ≤ i < n.  The symbol e i  stands for a vector that has 1 in position i, 0 elsewhere; thus  e i  j = δij. The symbol Dn stands for the set of all 2n n-place vectors of 0s and 1s, and Pn stands for the set of all n! vectors that are permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}. We write x ∧ y and x ∨ y for the vectors ⟨x1 ∧ y1, . . . , xn ∧ yn⟩ and ⟨x1 ∨ y1, . . . , xn ∨ yn⟩, and we write x ⊆ y if xi ≤ yi for all i. Thus x ⊆ y if and only if x∨ y = y if and only if x ∧ y = x. If x and y are in Dn, we say that x covers y if x =  y ∨ e i   ̸= y for some i. Finally for all x in Dn we let ν x  be the number of 1s in x, and ζ x  the number of 0s; thus ν x  + ζ x  = n. 1. [20] Draw a network diagram for the odd-even merge when m = 3 and n = 5. 2.

The sorting proceeds in t stages of t steps each; during the last stage all operations are “+”.

For example, the diagram  illustrates this interpretation when m = 2; each comparator merges its inputs and separates the lower half from the upper half.  If a and b are multisets of m numbers each, we say that a ≪ b if and only if a ∧∧ b = a  equivalently, a ∨∨ b = b; the largest element of a is less than or equal to the smallest of b .

If the input numbers are 2k-ordered in the sense of Theorem 5.2.1H, for some k ≥ 1, prove that both networks yield outputs that are 2k−1-ordered. Therefore we can sort 2t numbers by passing them through either network t times.

[25] Suppose the bit vector x ∈ Dn is not sorted. Show that there is a standard  n-network αx that fails to sort x, although it sorts all other elements of Dn. 57. [M35] The even-odd merge is similar to Batcher’s odd-even merge, except that when mn > 2 it recursively merges the sequence ⟨xm mod 2+1, . . . , xm−3, xm−1⟩ with ⟨y1, y3, . . . , y2⌈n 2⌉−1⟩ and ⟨x m+1  mod 2+1, . . . , xm−2, xm⟩ with ⟨y2, y4, . . . , y2⌊n 2⌋ ⟩ be- fore making a set of ⌈m 2⌉ + ⌈n 2⌉ − 1 comparison-interchanges analogous to  1 . Show that the even-odd merge achieves the optimum delay time ⌈lg m + n ⌉ of bitonic merging, without making more comparisons than the bitonic method. In fact, prove that the number of comparisons A m, n  made by even-odd merging satisfies C m, n  ≤ A m, n  < 1  2 m + n  lg min m, n  + m + 3  2 n.  EXERCISES — Second Set The following exercises deal with several different types of optimality questions related to sorting. The first few problems are based on an interesting “multihead” general- ization of the bubble sort, investigated by P. N. Armstrong and R. J. Nelson as early [See U.S. Patents 3029413, 3034102.] Let 1 = h1 < h2 < ··· < hm = n be as 1954. an increasing sequence of integers; we shall call it a “head sequence” of length m and span n, and we shall use it to define a special kind of sorting method. The sorting of records R1 . . . RN proceeds in several passes, and each pass consists of N + n− 1 steps. On step j, for j = 1 − n, 2 − n, . . . , N − 1, the records Rj+h[1], Rj+h[2], . . . , Rj+h[m] are examined and rearranged if necessary so that their keys are in order.  We say that Rj+h[1], . . . , Rj+h[m] are “under the read-write heads.” When j + h[k] is < 1 or > N, record Rj+h[k] is left out of consideration; in effect, the keys K0, K−1, K−2, . . . are treated as −∞ and KN+1, KN+2, . . . are treated as +∞. Therefore step j is actually trivial when j ≤ −h[m − 1] or j > N − h[2].   For example, the following table shows one pass of a sort when m = 3, N = 9,  and h1 = 1, h2 = 2, h3 = 4:  K−2 K−1 K0 K1 K2 K3 K4 K5 K6 K7 K8 K9 K10 K11 K12  j = −3 j = −2 j = −1 j = 0 j = 1 j = 2 j = 3 j = 4 j = 5 j = 6 j = 7 j = 8  3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  4 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4  9 9 9 9 9 9 6 5 5 5 5 5  2 2 2 2 2 5 5 6 6 6 6 6  6 6 6 6 6 6 9 9 7 7 7 7  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8  7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 9 9 9 9  When m = 2, h1 = 1, and h2 = 2, this multihead method reduces to the bubble sort  Algorithm 5.2.2B .   5.3.4  NETWORKS FOR SORTING  245  58.

But if h[k + 1] ≥ h[k] + 2 for 1 ≤ k < m, the input might never become sorted.   cid:120  59. [30]  Armstrong and Nelson.  Given that h[k + 1] ≤ h[k] + k for 1 ≤ k < m, and  N ≥ n− 1, prove that the largest n− 1 elements always move to their final destination on the first pass. [Hint: Use the zero-one principle; when sorting 0s and 1s, with fewer than n 1s, prove that it is impossible to have all heads sensing a 1 unless all 0s lie to the left of the heads.] Prove that sorting will be complete in at most ⌈ N − 1   n − 1 ⌉ passes when the heads satisfy the given conditions. Is there an input file that requires this many passes? 60. [26] If n = N, prove that the first pass can be guaranteed to place the smallest key into position R1 if and only if h[k + 1] ≤ 2h[k] for 1 ≤ k < m. 61. [34]  J. Hopcroft.  A “perfect sorter” for N elements is a multihead sorter with N = n that always finishes in one pass. Exercise 59 proves that the sequence 8N − 7+1  2 heads. For example, the head sequence ⟨1, 2, 4, 7, Prove that, in fact, the head sequence ⟨1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 23⟩ is a perfect sorter for  ⟨h1, h2, h3, h4, . . . , hm⟩ = ⟨1, 2, 4, 7, . . . , 1 +m  √ 2 elements, using m =   11, 16, 22⟩ is a perfect sorter for 22 elements.  ⟩ gives a perfect sorter for N =m   + 1  23 elements. 62.

When each head hk is in position 2k−1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ m, how many passes are necessary to sort the sequence z1 z2 . . . z2m−1 of 0s and 1s where zj = 0 if and only if j is a power of 2? 64. [24]  Uniform sorting.  The tree of Fig. 34 in Section 5.3.1 makes the comparison 2:3 in both branches on level 1, and on level 2 it compares 1:3 in each branch unless that comparison would be redundant. In general, we can consider the class of all sorting 2 pairs { a, b   1 ≤ a < b ≤ N} have been arranged into a sequence  algorithms whose comparisons are uniform in that way; assuming that the M =N    Is  2   a1, b1 ,  a2, b2 , . . . ,  aM , bM ,  we can successively make each of the comparisons Ka1 : Kb1, Ka2 : Kb2, . . . whose outcome is not already known. Each of the M! arrangements of the  a, b  pairs defines a uniform sorting algorithm. The concept of uniform sorting is due to H. L. Beus [JACM 17  1970 , 482–495], whose work has suggested the next few exercises. It is convenient to define uniform sorting formally by means of graph theory. Let G be the directed graph on the vertices {1, 2, . . . , N} having no arcs. For i = 1, 2, . . . , M we add arcs to G as follows:  Case 1. G contains a path from ai to bi. Add the arc ai → bi to G. Case 2. G contains a path from bi to ai. Add the arc bi → ai to G. Case 3. G contains no path from ai to bi or bi to ai. Compare Kai : Kbi; then add the arc ai → bi to G if Kai ≤ Kbi, the arc bi → ai if Kai > Kbi.  We are concerned primarily with the number of key comparisons made by a uniform sorting algorithm, not with the mechanism by which redundant comparisons are ac- tually avoided. Thus the graph G need not be constructed explicitly; it is used here merely to help define the concept of uniform sorting.   246  SORTING  5.3.4  We shall also consider restricted uniform sorting, in which only paths of length 2 are counted in cases 1, 2, and 3 above.  A restricted uniform sorting algorithm may make some redundant comparisons, but exercise 65 shows that the analysis is somewhat simpler in the restricted case.   Prove that the restricted uniform algorithm is the same as the uniform algorithm  when the sequence of pairs is taken in lexicographic order   1, 2  1, 3  1, 4  . . .  1, N  2, 3  2, 4  . . .  2, N  . . .

Disregard the order in which the comparisons are actually made in quicksort; consider only which pairs of keys are compared.  65. [M38] Given a pair sequence  a1, b1  . . .  aM , bM  as in exercise 64, let ci be the number of pairs  j, k  such that j < k < i and  ai, bi ,  aj, bj ,  ak, bk  forms a triangle. a  Prove that the average number of comparisons made by the restricted uniform  sorting algorithm isM  b  Use the results of  a  and exercise 64 to determine the average number of irredun-  i=1 2  ci + 2 .  dant comparisons performed by quicksort.  c  The following pair sequence is inspired by  but not equivalent to  merge sorting:   1, 2  3, 4  5, 6  . . .  1, 3  1, 4  2, 3  2, 4  5, 7  . . .  1, 5  1, 6  1, 7  1, 8  2, 5  . . .  2  Does the uniform method based on this sequence do more or fewer comparisons than quicksort, on the average?  66. [M29] In the worst case, quicksort does N uniform sorting algorithms  in the sense of exercise 64  perform N   comparisons. Do all restricted  comparisons in  their worst case? 67. [M48]  H. L.

Demuth  Stanford University, October 1956  was perhaps the first publication to deal in any detail with questions of computational complexity. Demuth considered several abstract models for sorting devices, and established lower and upper bounds on the mean and maxi- mum execution times achievable with each model. His simplest model, the “circular nonreversible memory”  Fig. 61 , is the subject of this exercise.  2  Fig. 61. A device for which the bubble-sort strategy is optimum.

EXTERNAL SORTING Now it is time for us to study the interesting problems that arise when the number of records to be sorted is larger than our computer can hold in its high-speed internal memory. External sorting is quite different from internal sorting, even though the problem in both cases is to sort a given file into nondecreasing order, since efficient storage accessing on external files is rather severely limited. The data structures must be arranged so that comparatively slow peripheral memory devices  tapes, disks, drums, etc.  can quickly cope with the requirements of the sorting algorithm. Consequently most of the internal sorting techniques we have studied  insertion, exchange, selection  are virtually useless for external sorting, and it is necessary to reconsider the whole question. Suppose, for example, that we are supposed to sort a file of five million records R1 R2 . . . R5000000, and that each record Ri is 20 words long  although the keys Ki are not necessarily this long . If only one million of these records will fit in the internal memory of our computer at one time, what shall we do? One fairly obvious solution is to start by sorting each of the five subfiles R1 . . . R1000000, R1000001 . . . R2000000, . . . , R4000001 . . . R5000000 independently, then to merge the resulting subfiles together. Fortunately the process of merging uses only very simple data structures, namely linear lists that are traversed in a sequential manner as stacks or as queues; hence merging can be done without difficulty on the least expensive external memory devices.  The process just described — internal sorting followed by external merging — is very commonly used, and we shall devote most of our study of external sorting to variations on this theme.  The ascending sequences of records that are produced by the initial internal sorting phase are often called strings in the published literature about sorting; this terminology is fairly widespread, but it unfortunately conflicts with even more widespread usage in other branches of computer science, where “strings” are arbitrary sequences of symbols. Our study of permutations has already given us a perfectly good name for the sorted segments of a file, which are conventionally called ascending runs or simply runs. Therefore we shall consistently use the word “runs” to describe sorted portions of a file. In this way it is possible to distinguish between “strings of runs” and “runs of strings” without ambiguity.  Of course, “runs of a program” means something else again; we can’t have everything.   Let us consider first the process of external sorting when magnetic tapes are used for auxiliary storage. Perhaps the simplest and most appealing way to merge with tapes is the balanced two-way merge following the central idea that was used in Algorithms 5.2.4N, S, and L. We use four “working tapes” in this process. During the first phase, ascending runs produced by internal sorting are placed alternately on Tapes 1 and 2, until the input is exhausted. Then Tapes 1 and 2 are rewound to their beginnings, and we merge the runs from these tapes, obtaining new runs that are twice as long as the original ones; the new runs are written alternately on Tapes 3 and 4 as they are being formed.  If Tape 1 contains one more run than Tape 2, an extra “dummy” run of length 0 is   5.4  EXTERNAL SORTING  249  assumed to be present on Tape 2.  Then all tapes are rewound, and the contents of Tapes 3 and 4 are merged into quadruple-length runs recorded alternately on Tapes 1 and 2. The process continues, doubling the length of runs each time, until only one run is left  namely the entire sorted file . If S runs were produced during the internal sorting phase, and if 2k−1 < S ≤ 2k, this balanced two-way merge procedure makes exactly k = ⌈lg S⌉ merging passes over all the data.  For example, in the situation above where 5000000 records are to be sorted with an internal memory capacity of 1000000, we have S = 5. The initial distribution phase of the sorting process places five runs on tape as follows: R1 . . . R1000000; R2000001 . . . R3000000; R4000001 . . . R5000000. R1000001 . . . R2000000; R3000001 . . . R4000000.  empty   empty   Tape 1 Tape 2 Tape 3 Tape 4   1   The first pass of merging then produces longer runs on Tapes 3 and 4, as it reads Tapes 1 and 2, as follows:  Tape 3 Tape 4  R1 . . . R2000000; R4000001 . . . R5000000. R2000001 . . . R4000000.   A dummy run has implicitly been added at the end of Tape 2, so that the last run R4000001 . . . R5000000 on Tape 1 is merely copied onto Tape 3.  After all tapes are rewound, the next pass over the data produces  Tape 1 Tape 2  R1 . . . R4000000. R4000001 . . . R5000000.   Again that run R4000001 . . . R5000000 was simply copied; but if we had started with 8000000 records, Tape 2 would have contained R4000001 . . . R8000000 at this point.  Finally, after another spell of rewinding, R1 . . . R5000000 is produced on Tape 3, and the sorting is complete. Balanced merging can easily be generalized to the case of T tapes, for any T ≥ 3. Choose any number P with 1 ≤ P < T, and divide the T tapes into two “banks,” with P tapes on the left bank and T − P on the right. Distribute the initial runs as evenly as possible onto the P tapes in the left bank; then do a P-way merge from the left to the right, followed by a  T − P -way merge from the right to the left, etc., until sorting is complete. The best choice of P usually turns out to be ⌈T  2⌉  see exercises 3 and 4 .  Balanced two-way merging is the special case T = 4, P = 2. Let us reconsider the example above using more tapes, taking T = 6 and P = 3. The initial distribution now gives us  Tape 1 Tape 2 Tape 3  R1 . . . R1000000; R3000001 . . . R4000000. R1000001 . . . R2000000; R4000001 . . . R5000000. R2000001 . . . R3000000.   2    3    4    250  SORTING  And the first merging pass produces  Tape 4 Tape 5 Tape 6  R1 . . . R3000000. R3000001 . . . R5000000.  empty   5.4   5    A dummy run has been assumed on Tape 3.  The second merging pass completes the job, placing R1 . . . R5000000 on Tape 1. In this special case T = 6 is essentially the same as T = 5, since the sixth tape is used only when S ≥ 7.  Three-way merging requires more computer processing than two-way merg- ing; but this is generally negligible compared to the cost of reading, writing, and rewinding the tapes. We can get a fairly good estimate of the running time by considering only the amount of tape motion. The example in  4  and  5  required only two passes over the data, compared to three passes when T = 4, so the merging takes only about two-thirds as long when T = 6.  Balanced merging is quite simple, but if we look more closely, we find immediately that it isn’t the best way to handle the particular cases treated above. Instead of going from  1  to  2  and rewinding all of the tapes, we should have stopped the first merging pass after Tapes 3 and 4 contained R1 . . . R2000000 and R2000001 . . . R4000000, respectively, with Tape 1 poised ready to read the records R4000001 . . . R5000000. Then Tapes 2, 3, 4 could be rewound and we could complete the sort by doing a three-way merge onto Tape 2. The total number of records read from tape during this procedure would be only 4000000+5000000 = 9000000, compared to 5000000 + 5000000 + 5000000 = 15000000 in the balanced scheme. A smart computer would be able to figure this out.  Indeed, when we have five runs and four tapes we can do even better by  distributing them as follows:  Tape 1 Tape 2 Tape 3 Tape 4  R1 . . . R1000000; R3000001 . . . R4000000. R1000001 . . . R2000000; R4000001 . . . R5000000. R2000001 . . . R3000000.  empty   Then a three-way merge to Tape 4, followed by a rewind of Tapes 3 and 4, followed by a three-way merge to Tape 3, would complete the sort with only 3000000 + 5000000 = 8000000 records read.  And, of course, if we had six tapes we could put the initial runs on Tapes 1 through 5 and complete the sort in one pass by doing a five-way merge to Tape 6. These considerations indicate that simple balanced merging isn’t the best, and it is interesting to look for improved merging patterns.  Subsequent portions of this chapter investigate external sorting more deeply. In Section 5.4.1, we will consider the internal sorting phase that produces the initial runs; of particular interest is the technique of “replacement selection,” which takes advantage of the order present in most data to produce long initial runs that actually exceed the internal memory capacity by a significant amount. Section 5.4.1 also discusses a suitable data structure for multiway merging.   5.4  EXTERNAL SORTING  251  The most important merging patterns are discussed in Sections 5.4.2 through 5.4.5. It is convenient to have a rather naïve conception of tape sorting as we learn the characteristics of these patterns, before we come to grips with the harsh realities of real tape drives and real data to be sorted. For example, we may blithely assume  as we did above  that the original input records appear magically during the initial distribution phase; in fact, these input records might well occupy one of our tapes, and they may even fill several tape reels since tapes aren’t of infinite length! It is best to ignore such mundane considerations until after an academic understanding of the classical merging patterns has been gained. Then Section 5.4.6 brings the discussion down to earth by discussing real-life constraints that strongly influence the choice of a pattern. Section 5.4.6 compares the basic merging patterns of Sections 5.4.2 through 5.4.5, using a variety of assumptions that arise in practice.  Some other approaches to external sorting, not based on merging, are dis- cussed in Sections 5.4.7 and 5.4.8. Finally Section 5.4.9 completes our survey of external sorting by treating the important problem of sorting on bulk memories such as disks and drums.  When this book was first written, magnetic tapes were abundant and disk drives were expensive. But disks became enormously better during the 1980s, and by the late 1990s they had almost completely replaced magnetic tape units on most of the world’s computer systems. Therefore the once-crucial topic of patterns for tape merging has become of limited relevance to current needs.  Yet many of the patterns are quite beautiful, and the associated algorithms reflect some of the best research done in computer science during its early years; the techniques are just too nice to be discarded abruptly onto the rubbish heap of history. Indeed, the ways in which these methods blend theory with practice are especially instructive. Therefore merging patterns are discussed carefully and completely below, in what may be their last grand appearance before they accept a final curtain call.  For all we know now, these techniques may well become crucial once again. — PAVEL CURTIS  1997   EXERCISES 1. [15] The text suggests internal sorting first, followed by external merging. Why don’t we do away with the internal sorting phase, simply merging the records into longer and longer runs right from the start? 2. [10] What will the sequence of tape contents be, analogous to  1  through  3 , when the example records R1 R2 . . . R5000000 are sorted using a 3-tape balanced method with P = 2? Compare this to the 4-tape merge; how many passes are made over all the data, after the initial distribution of runs? 3. [20] Show that the balanced  P, T−P  -way merge applied to S initial runs takes 2k passes, when P k T − P  k−1 < S ≤ P k T − P  k; and it takes 2k + 1 passes, when P k T − P  k < S ≤ P k+1 T − P  k. Give simple formulas for  a  the exact number of passes, as a function of S, when T = 2P ; and  b  the approximate number of passes, as S → ∞, for general P and T. 4. [HM15] What value of P , for 1 ≤ P < T, makes P  T − P   a maximum?   252  SORTING  5.4.1  5.4.1. Multiway Merging and Replacement Selection In Section 5.2.4, we studied internal sorting methods based on two-way merging, the process of combining two ordered sequences into a single ordered sequence. It is not difficult to extend this to the notion of P-way merging, where P runs of input are combined into a single run of output.  Let’s assume that we have been given P ascending runs, that is, sequences of records whose keys are in nondecreasing order. The obvious way to merge them is to look at the first record of each run and to select the record whose key is smallest; this record is transferred to the output and removed from the input, and the process is repeated. At any given time we need to look at only P keys  one from each input run  and select the smallest. If two or more keys are smallest, an arbitrary one is selected. When P isn’t too large, it is convenient to make this selection by simply doing P − 1 comparisons to find the smallest of the current keys. But when P is, say, 8 or more, we can save work by using a selection tree as described in Section 5.2.3; then only about lg P comparisons are needed each time, once the tree has been set up.  Consider, for example, the case of four-way merging, with a two-level selec-  tion tree:  Step 1.  Step 2.  Step 3.  ... Step 9.  087  087 154  087 154 170  612 ∞  170 908 ∞  170 908 ∞   087 087 503 ∞ 154 154 426 653 ∞  170 503 ∞ 154 154 426 653 ∞  170 503 ∞ 426 426 653 ∞  ∞  ∞ ∞  ∞  170 908 ∞  612 ∞  612 ∞  ∞  ∞  087 154 170 426 503 612 653 908 ∞  An additional key “∞” has been placed at the end of each run in this example, so that the merging terminates gracefully. Since external merging generally deals with very long runs, the addition of records with ∞ keys does not add substantially to the length of the data or to the amount of work involved in merging, and such sentinel records frequently serve as a useful way to delimit the runs on a file.   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  253  Fig. 62. A tournament to select the smallest key, using a complete binary tree  whose nodes are numbered from 1 to 23. There are P = 12 external nodes.  Each step after the first in this process consists of replacing the smallest element by the succeeding element in its run, and changing the corresponding path in the selection tree. Thus the three positions of the tree that contain 087 in Step 1 are changed in Step 2; the three positions containing 154 in Step 2 are changed in Step 3; and so on. The process of replacing one key by another in the selection tree is called replacement selection.  We can look at this four-way merge in several ways. From one standpoint it is equivalent to three two-way merges performed concurrently as coroutines; each node in the selection tree represents one of the sequences involved in concurrent merging processes. The selection tree is also essentially operating as a priority queue, with a smallest-in-first-out discipline.  As in Section 5.2.3 we could implement the priority queue by using a heap instead of a selection tree.  The heap would, of course, be arranged so that the smallest element appears at the top, instead of the largest, reversing the order of Eq. 5.2.3– 3 .  Since a heap does not have a fixed size, we could therefore avoid the use of ∞ keys; merging would be complete when the heap becomes empty. On the other hand, external sorting applications usually deal with comparatively long records and keys, so that the heap is filled with pointers to keys instead of the keys themselves; we shall see below that selection trees can be represented by pointers in such a convenient manner that they are probably superior to heaps in this situation. A tree of losers. Figure 62 shows the complete binary tree with 12 external  rectangular  nodes and 11 internal  circular  nodes. The external nodes have been filled with keys, and the internal nodes have been filled with the “winners,” if the tree is regarded as a tournament to select the smallest key. The smaller numbers above each node show the traditional way to allocate consecutive stor- age positions for complete binary trees.  1  061  2  154  3  061  4  170  5  154  6  087  7  061  8  170  9  275  10  426  11  154  12  13  14  15  503  087  512  061  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  908  170  897  275  653  426  154  509   254  SORTING  5.4.1  Fig. 63. The same tournament as Fig. 62, but showing the losers instead of the winners; the champion appears at the very top.  When the smallest key, 061, is to be replaced by another key in the selection tree of Fig. 62, we will have to look at the keys 512, 087, and 154, and no other existing keys, in order to determine the new state of the selection tree. Considering the tree as a tournament, these three keys are the losers in the matches played by 061. This suggests that the loser of a match should actually be stored in each internal node of the tree, instead of the winner; then the information required for updating the tree will be readily available.  Figure 63 shows the same tree as Fig. 62, but with the losers represented instead of the winners. An extra node number 0 has been appended at the top of the tree, to indicate the champion of the tournament. Each key except the champion is a loser exactly once  see Section 5.3.3 , so each key appears just once in an external node and once in an internal node.  In practice, the external nodes at the bottom of Fig. 63 will represent fairly long records stored in computer memory, and the internal nodes will represent pointers to those records. Note that P-way merging calls for exactly P external nodes and P internal nodes, each in consecutive positions of memory, hence several efficient methods of storage allocation suggest themselves. It is not difficult to see how to use a loser-oriented tree for replacement selection; we shall discuss the details later. Initial runs by replacement selection. The technique of replacement se- lection can be used also in the first phase of external sorting, if we essentially do a P-way merge of the input data with itself! In this case we take P to be quite large, so that the internal memory is essentially filled. When a record is output, it is replaced by the next record from the input. If the new record has a smaller key than the one just output, we cannot include it in the current run; but  0  1  061  154  2  170  3  087  4  275  5  426  6  503  7  512  8  908  9  897  10  653  11  509  12  13  14  15  503  087  512  061  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  908  170  897  275  653  426  154  509   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  255  Table 1  EXAMPLE OF FOUR-WAY REPLACEMENT SELECTION  Memory contents  Output  503 503 503 503  275   275   275   275   275  275 275  087 087 170 897 897 897 897  154   154  154 612  061 908 908 908 908 908 908 908  509  509 509  512 512 512 512 512 653  426   426   426  426 426  etc.  061 087 170 503 512 653 897 908  154 275   end of run   otherwise we can enter it into the selection tree in the usual way and it will form part of the run currently being produced. Thus the runs can contain more than P records each, even though we never have more than P in the selection tree at any time. Table 1 illustrates this process for P = 4; parenthesized numbers are waiting for inclusion in the following run.  This important method of forming initial runs was first described by Har- old H. Seward [Master’s Thesis, Digital Computer Laboratory Report R-232  Mass. Inst. of Technology, 1954 , 29–30], who gave reason to believe that the runs would contain more than 1.5P records when applied to random data. A. I. Dumey had also suggested the idea about 1950 in connection with a special sort- ing device planned by Engineering Research Associates, but he did not publish it. The name “replacement selecting” was coined by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 154], who remarked that “the expected length of the sequences produced eludes formulation but experiment suggests that 2P is a reasonable expectation.”  A clever way to show that 2P is indeed the expected run length was discov- ered by E. F. Moore, who compared the situation to a snowplow on a circular track [U.S. Patent 2983904  1961 , columns 3–4]. Consider the situation shown in Fig. 64: Flakes of snow are falling uniformly on a circular road, and a lone snowplow is continually clearing the snow. Once the snow has been plowed off the road, it disappears from the system. Points on the road may be designated by real numbers x, 0 ≤ x < 1; a flake of snow falling at position x represents an input record whose key is x, and the snowplow represents the output of replacement selection. The ground speed of the snowplow is inversely proportional to the height of snow it encounters, and the situation is perfectly balanced so that the total amount of snow on the road at all times is exactly P. A new run is formed in the output whenever the plow passes point 0.  After this system has been in operation for awhile, it is intuitively clear that it will approach a stable situation in which the snowplow runs at constant speed  because of the circular symmetry of the track . This means that the snow is at   256  SORTING  5.4.1  Fig. 64. The perpetual plow on its ceaseless cycle.  constant height when it meets the plow, and the height drops off linearly in front of the plow as shown in Fig. 65. It follows that the volume of snow removed in one revolution  namely the run length  is twice the amount present at any one time  namely P .  Fig. 65. Cross-section, showing the varying height of snow in front of the plow when the system is in its steady state.  In many commercial applications the input data is not completely random; it already has a certain amount of existing order. Therefore the runs produced by replacement selection will tend to contain even more than 2P records. We shall see that the time required for external merge sorting is largely governed by the number of runs produced by the initial distribution phase, so that replacement selection becomes especially desirable; other types of internal sorting would pro- duce about twice as many initial runs because of the limitations on memory size. Let us now consider the process of creating initial runs by replacement selection in detail. The following algorithm is due to John R. Walters, James Painter, and Martin Zalk, who used it in a merge-sort program for the Philco 2000 in 1958. It incorporates a rather nice way to initialize the selection tree and to distinguish records belonging to different runs, as well as to flush out the last run, with comparatively simple and uniform logic.  The proper handling of the last run produced by replacement selection turns out to be a bit tricky,   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  257  Fig. 66. Making initial runs by replacement selection.  and it has tended to be a stumbling block for programmers.  The principal idea is to consider each key as a pair  S, K , where K is the original key and S is the run number to which this record belongs. When such extended keys are lexicographically ordered, with S as major key and K as minor key, we obtain the output sequence produced by replacement selection.  The algorithm below uses a data structure containing P nodes to represent the selection tree; the jth node X[j] is assumed to contain c words beginning in LOC X[j]  = L0 + cj, for 0 ≤ j < P, and it represents both internal node number j and external node number P + j in Fig. 63. There are several named fields in each node:  KEY = the key stored in this external node;  RECORD = the record stored in this external node  including KEY as a subfield ; LOSER = pointer to the “loser” stored in this internal node;  RN = run number of the record stored in this external node; PE = pointer to internal node above this external node in the tree; PI = pointer to internal node above this internal node in the tree.  For example, when P = 12, internal node number 5 and external node number 17 of Fig. 63 would both be represented in X[5], by the fields KEY = 170, LOSER = L0 + 9c  the address of external node number 21 , PE = L0 + 8c, PI = L0 + 2c. The PE and PI fields have constant values, so they need not appear explicitly in memory; however, the initial phase of external sorting sometimes has trouble keeping up with the I O devices, and it might be worthwhile to store these redundant values with the data instead of recomputing them each time. Algorithm R  Replacement selection . This algorithm reads records sequen- tially from an input file and writes them sequentially onto an output file, pro- ducing RMAX runs whose length is P or more  except for the final run . There are P ≥ 2 nodes, X[0], . . . , X[P − 1], having fields as described above. R1. [Initialize.] Set RMAX ← 0, RC ← 0, LASTKEY ← ∞, and Q ← LOC X[0] .  Here RC is the number of the current run and LASTKEY is the key of the  R1. Initialize  R2. End of run?  End of ﬁle  R3. Output top of tree  R4. Input new record  R5. Prepare  to update  T = root  R7. Move up  R6. Set new loser   258  SORTING  5.4.1  last record output. The initial setting of LASTKEY should be larger than any possible key; see exercise 8.  For 0 ≤ j < P, set the initial contents of X[j] as follows:  J ← LOC X[j] ;  LOSER J  ← J;  RN J  ← 0;  PE J  ← LOC X[⌊ P + j  2⌋] ;  PI J  ← LOC X[⌊j 2⌋] .   The settings of LOSER J  and RN J  are artificial ways to get the tree initialized by considering a fictitious run number 0 that is never output. This is tricky; see exercise 10.   R2. [End of run?] If RN Q  = RC, go on to step R3.  Otherwise RN Q  = RC + 1 and we have just completed run number RC; any special actions required by a merging pattern for subsequent passes of the sort would be done at this point.  If RC = RMAX, stop; otherwise set RC ← RC + 1.  R3. [Output top of tree.]  Now Q points to the “champion,” and RN Q  = RC.   If RC ̸= 0, output RECORD Q  and set LASTKEY ← KEY Q .  R4. [Input new record.] If the input file is exhausted, set RN Q  ← RMAX + 1 and go on to step R5. Otherwise set RECORD Q  to the next record from the input file. If KEY Q  < LASTKEY  so that this new record does not belong to the current run , set RMAX ← RN Q  ← RC + 1.  R5. [Prepare to update.]   Now Q points to a new record.  Set T ← PE Q .   Variable T is a pointer that will move up the tree.   R6. [Set new loser.] Set L ← LOSER T . If RN L  < RN Q  or if RN L  = RN Q  and KEY L  < KEY Q , then set LOSER T  ← Q and Q ← L.  Variable Q keeps track of the current winner.   R7. [Move up.] If T = LOC X[1]  then go back to R2, otherwise set T ← PI T   and return to R6. Algorithm R speaks of input and output of records one at a time, while in practice it is best to read and write relatively large blocks of records. Therefore some input and output buffers are actually present in memory, behind the scenes, effectively lowering the size of P. We shall illustrate this in Section 5.4.6. *Delayed reconstitution of runs. A very interesting way to improve on replacement selection has been suggested by R. J. Dinsmore [CACM 8  1965 , 48] using a concept that we shall call degrees of freedom. As we have seen, each block of records on tape within a run is in nondecreasing order, so that its first element is the lowest and its last element is the highest. In the ordinary process of replacement selection, the lowest element of each block within a run is never less than the highest element of the preceding block in that run; this is “1 degree of freedom.” Dinsmore suggests relaxing this condition to “m degrees of freedom,” where the lowest element of each block may be less than the highest element of the preceding block so long as it is not less than the highest elements in m different preceding blocks of the same run. Records within individual blocks are ordered, as before, but adjacent blocks need not be in order.   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  259  For example, suppose that there are just two records per block; the following  sequence of blocks is a run with three degrees of freedom:  08 50  06 90  17 27  42 67  51 89    1  A subsequent block that is to be part of the same run must begin with an element not less than the third largest element of {50, 90, 27, 67, 89}, namely 67. The sequence  1  would not be a run if there were only two degrees of freedom, since 17 is less than both 50 and 90.  A run with m degrees of freedom can be “reconstituted” while it is being read during the next phase of sorting, so that for all practical purposes it is a run in the ordinary sense. We start by reading the first m blocks into m buffers, and doing an m-way merge on them; when one buffer is exhausted, we replace it with the  m + 1 st block, and so on. In this way we can recover the run as a single sequence, for the first word of every newly read block must be greater than or equal to the last word of the just-exhausted block  lest it be less than the highest elements in m different blocks that precede it . This method of reconstituting the run is essentially like an m-way merge using a single tape unit for all the input blocks! The reconstitution procedure acts as a coroutine that is called upon to deliver one record of the run at a time. We could be reconstituting different runs from different tape units with different degrees of freedom, and merging the resulting runs, all at the same time, in essentially the same way as the four-way merge illustrated at the beginning of this section may be thought of as several two-way merges going on at once.  This ingenious idea is difficult to analyze precisely, but T. O. Espelid has shown how to extend the snowplow analogy to obtain an approximate formula for the behavior [BIT 16  1976 , 133–142]. According to his approximation, which agrees well with empirical tests, the run length will be about   2P +  m − 2 b  2P +  2m − 3 b    b,  2P +  m − 1.5   when b is the block size and m ≥ 2. Such an increase may not be enough to justify the added complication; on the other hand, it may be advantageous when there is room for a rather large number of buffers during the second phase of sorting. *Natural selection. Another way to increase the run lengths produced by replacement selection has been explored by W. D. Frazer and C. K. Wong [CACM 15  1972 , 910–913]. Their idea is to proceed as in Algorithm R, except that a new record is not placed in the tree when its key is less than LASTKEY; it is output into an external reservoir instead, and another new record is read in. This process continues until the reservoir is filled with a certain number of records, P ′; then the remainder of the current run is output from the tree, and the reservoir items are used as input for the next run.  The use of a reservoir tends to produce longer runs than replacement selec- tion, because it reroutes the “dead” records that belong to the next run instead of letting them clutter up the tree; but it requires extra time for input and output   260  SORTING  5.4.1  Fig. 67. Equal amounts of snow are input and output; the plow moves dx in time dt.  to and from the reservoir. When P ′ > P it is possible that some records will be placed into the reservoir twice, but when P ′ ≤ P this will never happen. Frazer and Wong made extensive empirical tests of their method, noticing that when P is reasonably large  say P ≥ 32  and P ′ = P the average run length for random data is approximately given by eP, where e ≈ 2.718 is the base of natural logarithms. This phenomenon, and the fact that the method is an evolutionary improvement over simple replacement selection, naturally led them to call their method natural selection.  The “natural” law for run lengths can be proved by considering the snowplow of Fig. 64 again, and applying elementary calculus. Let L be the length of the track, and let x t  be the position of the snowplow at time t, for 0 ≤ t ≤ T. The reservoir is assumed to be full at time T, when the snow stops temporarily while the plow returns to its starting position  clearing the P units of snow remaining in its path . The situation is the same as before except that the “balance condition” is different; instead of P units of snow on the road at all times, we have P units of snow in front of the plow, and the reservoir  behind the plow  gets up to P ′ = P units. The snowplow advances by dx during a time interval dt if h x, t  dx records are output, where h x, t  is the height of the snow at time t and position x = x t , measured in suitable units; hence h x, t  = h x, 0  + Kt for all x, where K is the rate of snowfall. Since the number of records in memory stays constant, h x, t  dx is also the number of records that are input ahead of the plow, namely K dt L − x   see Fig. 67 . Thus  = K L − x  h x, t   .  dx dt  Fortunately, it turns out that h x, t  is constant, equal to KT, whenever x = x t  and 0 ≤ t ≤ T, since the snow falls steadily at position x t  for T −t units of time after the plow passes that point, plus t units of time before it comes back. In other words, the plow sees all snow at the same height on its journey, assuming that a steady state has been reached where each journey is the same. Hence the total amount of snow cleared  the run length  is LKT; and the amount of  snow in memory is the amount cleared after time T, namely KTL− x T . The  solution to  2  such that x 0  = 0 is  x t  = L 1 − e−t T  ;  hence P = LKT e−1 =  run length  e; and this is what we set out to prove.   2    3    5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  261  Exercises 21 through 23 show that this analysis can be extended to the case of general P ′; for example, when P ′ = 2P the average run length turns out to  e2 − 42, a result that probably wouldn’t have  be eθ e− θ P, where θ =e−√  been guessed offhand! Table 2 shows the dependence of run length on reservoir size; the usefulness of natural selection in a given computer environment can be estimated by referring to this table. The table entries for reservoir size < P use an improved technique that is discussed in exercise 27.  The ideas of delayed run reconstitution and natural selection can be com- bined, as discussed by T. C. Ting and Y. W. Wang in Comp. J. 20  1977 , 298–301.

Let us now return to the case of replace- ment selection without an auxiliary reservoir. The snowplow analogy gives us a fairly good indication of the average length of runs obtained by replacement selection in the steady-state limit, but it is possible to get much more precise information about Algorithm R by applying the facts about runs in permutations that we have studied in Section 5.1.3. For this purpose it is convenient to assume that the input file is an arbitrarily long sequence of independent random real numbers between 0 and 1.  Let  gP  z1, z2, . . . , zk  =   aP  l1, l2, . . . , lk zl1  1 zl2  2 . . . zlk  k  l1,l2,...,lk≥0  be the generating function for run lengths produced by P-way replacement selection on such a file, where aP  l1, l2, . . . , lk  is the probability that the first run has length l1, the second has length l2, . . . , the kth has length lk. The following “independence theorem” is basic, since it reduces the analysis to the case P = 1: Theorem K. gP  z1, z2, . . . , zk  = g1 z1, z2, . . . , zk P. Proof. Let the input keys be K1, K2, K3, . . . . Algorithm R partitions them into P subsequences, according to which external node position they occupy in the   SORTING  262 5.4.1 tree; the subsequence containing Kn is determined by the values of K1, . . . , Kn−1. Each of these subsequences is therefore an independent sequence of independent random numbers between 0 and 1. Furthermore, the output of replacement selection is precisely what would be obtained by doing a P-way merge on these subsequences; an element belongs to the jth run of a subsequence if and only if it belongs to the jth run produced by replacement selection  since LASTKEY and KEY Q  belong to the same subsequence in step R4 .  In other words, we might just as well assume that Algorithm R is being applied to P independent random input files, and that step R4 reads the next record from the file corresponding to external node Q; in this sense, the algorithm is equivalent to a P-way merge, with “stepdowns” marking the ends of the runs. Thus the output has runs of lengths  l1, . . . , lk  if and only if the sub- sequences have runs of respective lengths  l11, . . . , l1k , . . . ,  lP 1, . . . , lP k , where 1≤i≤P lij = lj for 1 ≤ j ≤ k.  the lij are some nonnegative integers satisfying  It follows that  aP  l1, . . . , lk  =   a1 l11, . . . , l1k  . . . a1 lP 1, . . . , lP k ,  l11+···+lP 1=l1 l1k+···+lP k=lk  ···  and this is equivalent to the desired result.  We have discussed the average length Lk of the kth run, when P = 1, in Section 5.1.3, where the values are tabulated in Table 5.1.3–2. Theorem K implies that the average length of the kth run for general P is P times as long as the average when P = 1, namely LkP; and the variance is also P times as large, so the standard deviation of the run length is proportional to P. These results were first derived by B. J. Gassner about 1958. Thus the first run produced by Algorithm R will be about  e−1 P ≈ 1.718P records long, for random data; the second run will be about  e2−2e P ≈ 1.952P records long; the third, about 1.996P; and subsequent runs will be very close to 2P records long until we get to the last two runs  see exercise 14 . The  standard deviation of most of these run lengths is approximately 4e − 10 P ≈ P, with a the total length of the first k runs will be fairly close to 2k − 1 standard deviation of  2 P1 2. The generating functions g1 z, z, . . . , z   P [CACM 6  1963 , 685–688]. Furthermore, exercise 5.1.3–10 shows that  0.934  √  √  3  3 k + 2 9  and g1 1, . . . , 1, z  are derived in exercises 5.1.3–9 and 11.  The analysis above has assumed that the input file is infinitely long, but the proof of Theorem K shows that the same probability ap l1, . . . , lk  would be obtained in any random input sequence containing at least l1 + ··· + lk + P elements. So the results above are applicable for, say, files of size N >  2k +1 P, in view of the small standard deviation.  We will be seeing some applications in which the merging pattern wants some of the runs to be ascending and some to be descending. Since the residue accumulated in memory at the end of an ascending run tends to contain numbers somewhat smaller on the average than random data, a change in the direction   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  263  of ordering decreases the average length of the runs. Consider, for example, a snowplow that must make a U-turn every time it reaches an end of a straight road; it will go very speedily over the area just plowed. The run lengths when directions are reversed vary between 1.5P and 2P for random data  see exercise 24 .  EXERCISES 1.

[HM22] Use the snowplow analogy to prove that the first run produced by re- placement selection is approximately  e − 1 P records long. 20. [HM24] Approximately how long is the first run produced by natural selection, when P = P ′?   cid:120  21. [HM23] Determine the approximate length of runs produced by natural selection  when P ′ < P . 22. [HM40] The purpose of this exercise is to determine the average run length obtained in natural selection, when P ′ > P . Let κ = k + θ be a real number ≥ 1, where k = ⌊κ⌋ and θ = κ mod 1, and consider the function F  κ  = Fk θ , where Fk θ  is the polynomial defined by the generating function Fk θ zk = e−θz  1 − ze    1−z .  k≥0  Thus, F0 θ  = 1, F1 θ  = e − θ, F2 θ  = e2 − e − eθ + 1  2 θ2, etc.  Suppose that a snowplow starts out at time 0 to simulate the process of natural selection, and suppose that after T units of time exactly P snowflakes have fallen behind it. At this point a second snowplow begins on the same journey, occupying the same position at time t + T as the first snowplow did at time t. Finally, at time κT, exactly P ′ snowflakes have fallen behind the first snowplow; it instantaneously plows the rest of the road and disappears.  Using this model to represent the process of natural selection, show that a run  length equal to eθF  κ P is obtained when  P ′ P = k + 1 + eθ  F  κ − j   .   κF  κ  − k  j=0    23. [HM35] The preceding exercise analyzes natural selection when the records from the reservoir are always read in the same order as they were written, first-in-first- out. Find the approximate run length that would be obtained if the reservoir contents from the preceding run were read in completely random order, as if the records in the reservoir had been thoroughly shuffled between runs. 24. [HM39] The purpose of this exercise is to analyze the effect caused by haphazardly changing the direction of runs in replacement selection. a  Let gP  z1, z2, . . . , zk  be a generating function defined as in Theorem K, but with each of the k runs specified as to whether it is to be ascending or descending.   5.4.1  MULTIWAY MERGING AND REPLACEMENT SELECTION  265  prove that   1  For example, we might say that all odd-numbered runs are ascending, all even- numbered runs are descending. Show that Theorem K is valid for each of the 2k generating functions of this type.  b  As a consequence of  a , we may assume that P = 1. We may also assume that the input is a uniformly distributed sequence of independent random numbers between 0 and 1. Let   e1−x − ey−x,  e1−x,  if x ≤ y; if x > y.  a x, y  =  Given that f x  dx is the probability that a certain ascending run begins with x, 0 a x, y f x  dx  dy is the probability that the following run begins [Hint: Consider, for each n ≥ 0, the probability that x ≤ X1 ≤ ··· ≤  with y. Xn > y, when x and y are given.]  c  Consider runs that change direction with probability p; in other words, the direc- tion of each run after the first is randomly chosen to be the same as that of the previous run, q =  1 − p  of the time, but it is to be in the opposite direction p of the time.  Thus when p = 0, all runs have the same direction; when p = 1, the runs alternate in direction; and when p = 1 2, the runs are independently random.  Let  f1 x  = 1,  fn+1 y  = p  a x, y fn 1 − x  dx + q  a x, y fn x  dx.   1  0  Show that the probability that the nth run begins with x is fn x  dx when the  n − 1 st run is ascending, fn 1 − x  dx when the  n − 1 st run is descending.  d  Find a solution f to the steady-state equations  f y  = p  a x, y f 1 − x  dx + q  a x, y f x  dx,  f x  dx = 1.   1  0   1  0   1  0   1  0  [Hint: Show that f′′ x  is independent of x.]  e  Show that the sequence fn x  in part  c  converges rather rapidly to the function  f x  in part  d .  f  Show that the average length of an ascending run starting with x is e1−x. g  Finally, put all these results together to prove the following theorem:  If the directions of consecutive runs are independently reversed with probability p in replacement selection, the average run length approaches  6  3 + p  P .  The case p = 1 of this theorem was first derived by Knuth [CACM 6  1963 ,  685–688]; the case p = 1 25. [HM40] Consider the following procedure:  2 was first proved by A. G. Konheim in 1970.   N1. Read a record into a one-word “reservoir.” Then read another record, R, and  let K be its key.  N2. Output the reservoir, set LASTKEY to its key, and set the reservoir empty. N3. If K < LASTKEY then output R and set LASTKEY ← K and go to N5. N4. If the reservoir is nonempty, return to N2; otherwise enter R into the reservoir. N5. Read in a new record, R, and let K be its key. Go to N3.  This is essentially equivalent to natural selection with P = 1 and with P ′ = 1 or 2  depending on whether you choose to empty the reservoir at the moment it fills or at   266  SORTING  5.4.1  the moment it is about to overfill , except that it produces descending runs, and it never stops. The latter anomalies are convenient and harmless assumptions for the purposes of this problem.  Proceeding as in exercise 24, let fn x, y  dy dx be the probability that x and y are the respective values of LASTKEY and K just after the nth time step N2 is performed. Prove that there is a function gn x  of one variable such that fn x, y  = gn x  when x   y.

Then we can flush them to the output and replace them with the reservoir contents.  How much better is this method than the simpler approach analyzed in exercise 21? 28. [25] The text considers only the case that all records to be sorted have a fixed size. How can replacement selection be done reasonably well on variable-length records?  for n > 0.   5.4.2  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  267  29. [22] Consider the 2k nodes of a complete binary tree that has been right-threaded, illustrated here when k = 3:   Compare with 2.3.1– 10 ; the top node is the list head, and the dotted lines are thread links. In this exercise we are not concerned with sorting but rather with the structure of complete binary trees when a list-head-like node 0 has been added above node 1, as in the “tree of losers,” Fig. 63.   Show how to assign the 2n+k internal nodes of a large tree of losers onto these 2k host nodes so that  i  every host node holds exactly 2n nodes of the large tree;  ii  adjacent nodes in the large tree either are assigned to the same host node or to host nodes that are adjacent  linked ; and  iii  no two pairs of adjacent nodes in the large tree are separated by the same link in the host tree. [Multiple virtual processors in a large binary tree network can thereby be mapped to actual processors without undue congestion in the communication links.] 30. [M29] Prove that if n ≥ k ≥ 1, the construction in the preceding exercise is optimum, in the sense that any 2k-node host graph satisfying  i ,  ii , and  iii  must have at least 2k + 2k−1 − 1 edges  links  between nodes. *5.4.2. The Polyphase Merge Now that we have seen how initial runs can be built up, we shall consider various patterns that can be used to distribute them onto tapes and to merge them together until only a single run remains.  Let us begin by assuming that there are three tape units, T1, T2, and T3, available; the technique of “balanced merging,” described near the beginning of Section 5.4, can be used with P = 2 and T = 3, when it takes the following form: B1. Distribute initial runs alternately on tapes T1 and T2. B2. Merge runs from T1 and T2 onto T3; then stop if T3 contains only one run. B3. Copy the runs of T3 alternately onto T1 and T2, then return to B2. If the initial distribution pass produces S runs, the first merge pass will produce ⌈S 2⌉ runs on T3, the second will produce ⌈S 4⌉, etc. Thus if, say, 17 ≤ S ≤ 32, we will have 1 distribution pass, 5 merge passes, and 4 copy passes; in general, if S > 1, the number of passes over all the data is 2⌈lg S⌉.  The copying passes in this procedure are undesirable, since they do not reduce the number of runs. Half of the copying can be avoided if we use a two-phase procedure: A1. Distribute initial runs alternately on tapes T1 and T2. A2. Merge runs from T1 and T2 onto T3; then stop if T3 contains only one run. A3. Copy half of the runs from T3 onto T1. A4. Merge runs from T1 and T3 onto T2; then stop if T2 contains only one run. A5. Copy half of the runs from T2 onto T1. Return to A2.   268  SORTING  5.4.2  Contents of T2 Contents of T3 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1  The number of passes over the data has been reduced to 3 2, since steps A3 and A5 do only “half a pass”; about 25 percent of the time has therefore been saved. The copying can actually be eliminated entirely, if we start with Fn runs on T1 and Fn−1 runs on T2, where Fn and Fn−1 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Consider, for example, the case n = 7, S = Fn + Fn−1 = 13 + 8 = 21: Phase  Contents of T1  Remarks  2⌈lg S⌉ + 1  —  — 21  — 13 —  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  — 8,8 8 —  — 5,5,5 5  3,3,3,3,3 3,3  1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 1,1,1,1,1  Initial distribution 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2 Merge 8 runs to T3 2,2,2 Merge 5 runs to T2 Merge 3 runs to T1 Merge 2 runs to T3 Merge 1 run to T2 Merge 1 run to T1 Here, for example, “2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2” denotes eight runs of relative length 2, con- sidering each initial run to be of relative length 1. Fibonacci numbers are omnipresent in this chart!  Only phases 1 and 7 are complete passes over the data; phase 2 processes only 16 21 of the initial runs, phase 3 only 15 21, etc., and so the total number of “passes” comes to  21 + 16 + 15 + 15 + 16 + 13 + 21  21 = 5 4 7 if we assume that the initial runs have approximately equal length. By comparison, the two- phase procedure above would have required 8 passes to sort these 21 initial runs. We shall see that in general this “Fibonacci” pattern requires approximately 1.04 lg S + 0.99 passes, making it competitive with a four-tape balanced merge although it requires only three tapes. The same idea can be generalized to T tapes, for any T ≥ 3, using  T − 1 - way merging. We shall see, for example, that the four-tape case requires only about .703 lg S + 0.96 passes over the data. The generalized pattern involves generalized Fibonacci numbers. Consider the following six-tape example: Initial runs processed  Phase  T6  T2 T1 130 131 114 115 16 17 12 13 — 332 11 331 651 — 1291 — —  T4 T3 124 128 18 112 14 — — 174 172 171 —  T5 116 — 31 + 30 + 28 + 24 + 16 = 129 16 × 5 = 80 — 516 8 × 9 = 72 58 98 4 × 17 = 68 94 54 2 × 33 = 66 52 92 1 × 65 = 65 91 51 1 × 129 = 129 — —  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Here 131 stands for 31 runs of relative length 1, etc.; five-way merges have been used throughout. This general pattern was developed by R. L. Gilstad [Proc. Eastern Joint Computer Conf. 18  1960 , 143–148], who called it the polyphase merge. The three-tape case had been discovered earlier by B. K. Betz [unpublished memorandum, Minneapolis–Honeywell Regulator Co.  1956 ].  In order to make polyphase merging work as in the examples above, we need to have a “perfect Fibonacci distribution” of runs on the tapes after each   5.4.2  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  269  phase. By reading the table above from bottom to top, we can see that the first seven perfect Fibonacci distributions when T = 6 are {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {2,2,2,2,1}, {4,4,4,3,2}, {8,8,7,6,4}, {16,15,14,12,8}, and {31,30,28,24,16}. The big questions now facing us are 1. What is the rule underlying these perfect Fibonacci distributions? 2. What do we do if S does not correspond to a perfect Fibonacci distribution? 3. How should we design the initial distribution pass so that it produces the  desired configuration on the tapes?  4. How many “passes” over the data will a T-tape polyphase merge require, as  a function of S  the number of initial runs ?  We shall discuss these four questions in turn, first giving “easy answers” and then making a more intensive analysis.  The perfect Fibonacci distributions can be obtained by running the pattern backwards, cyclically rotating the tape contents. For example, when T = 6 we have the following distribution of runs:  Level  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  .  .  .  .  n  T1 1 1 2 4 8 16 31 61 120 . . an  T2 0 1 2 4 8 15 30 59 116 . . bn  T3 0 1 2 4 7 14 28 55 108 . . cn  T4 0 1 2 3 6 12 24 47 92 . dn  Total 1 5 9 17 33 65 129 253 497 . . tn  T5 0 1 1 2 4 8 16 31 61 . en an .

Tape T6 will always be empty after the initial distribution.   an + cn . .  an + dn .  an + en . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  The rule for going from level n to level n + 1 shows that the condition  an ≥ bn ≥ cn ≥ dn ≥ en  will hold in every level. In fact, it is easy to see from  1  that  en = an−1, dn = an−1 + en−1 = an−1 + an−2, cn = an−1 + dn−1 = an−1 + an−2 + an−3, bn = an−1 + cn−1 = an−1 + an−2 + an−3 + an−4, an = an−1 + bn−1 = an−1 + an−2 + an−3 + an−4 + an−5,  where a0 = 1 and where we let an = 0 for n = −1, −2, −3, −4.   1    2    3    270  SORTING  5.4.2   4   The pth-order Fibonacci numbers F  are defined by the rules   p  n  F  p  n = F F  p  n = 0,   p    p   n−1 + F  n−2 + ··· + F  p  n−p, for 0 ≤ n ≤ p − 2;  for n ≥ p;  p  p−1 = 1. F  In other words, we start with p− 1 0s, then 1, and then each number is the sum of the preceding p values. When p = 2, this is the usual Fibonacci sequence, and when p = 3 it has been called the Tribonacci sequence. Such sequences were apparently first studied for p > 2 by N¯ar¯ayan.a Pan.d.ita in 1356 [see P. Singh, Historia Mathematica 12  1985 , 229–244], then many years later by V. Schlegel in El Progreso Matemático 4  1894 , 173–174. Schlegel derived the generating  F  p  n zn =  1 − z − z2 − ··· − zp = zp−1 − zp 1 − 2z + zp+1 .  zp−1   5   function   n≥0  The last equation of  3  shows that the number of runs on T1 during a six-tape polyphase merge is a fifth-order Fibonacci number: an = F In general, if we set P = T −1, the polyphase merge distributions for T tapes will correspond to P th order Fibonacci numbers in the same way.

And how do we get the runs onto the tapes in the first place?  n+P−2 +  P − 1 F  n+P−3 + ··· + F  When S isn’t perfect  and so few values are , we can do just as we did in balanced P-way merging, adding artificial “dummy runs” so that we can pretend S is perfect after all. There are several ways to add the dummy runs, and we aren’t ready yet to analyze the “best” way of doing this. We shall discuss first a method of distribution and dummy-run assignment that isn’t strictly optimal, although it has the virtue of simplicity and appears to be better than all other equally simple methods. Algorithm D  Polyphase merge sorting with “horizontal” distribution . This algorithm takes initial runs and disperses them to tapes, one run at a time, until the supply of initial runs is exhausted. Then it specifies how the tapes are to be merged, assuming that there are T = P + 1 ≥ 3 available tape units, using P-way merging. Tape T may be used to hold the input, since it does not receive any initial runs. The following tables are maintained:  A[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: The perfect Fibonacci distribution we are striving for. D[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: Number of dummy runs assumed to be present at the  beginning of logical tape unit number j.   5.4.2  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  271  Fig. 68. Polyphase merge sorting.  TAPE[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: Number of the physical tape unit corresponding to logical  tape unit number j.   It is convenient to deal with “logical tape unit numbers” whose assignment to physical tape units varies as the algorithm proceeds.  D1. [Initialize.] Set A[j] ← D[j] ← 1 and TAPE[j] ← j, for 1 ≤ j < T. Set  A[T ] ← D[T ] ← 0 and TAPE[T ] ← T. Then set l ← 1, j ← 1.  D2. [Input to tape j.] Write one run on tape number j, and decrease D[j] by 1.  Then if the input is exhausted, rewind all the tapes and go to step D5.  D3. [Advance j.] If D[j] < D[j + 1], increase j by 1 and return to D2. Other-  wise if D[j] = 0, go on to D4. Otherwise set j ← 1 and return to D2.  D4. [Up a level.] Set l ← l + 1, a ← A[1], and then for j = 1, 2, . . . , P  in this order  set D[j] ← a + A[j + 1] − A[j] and A[j] ← a + A[j + 1].  See  1  and note that A[P + 1] is always zero. At this point we will have D[1] ≥ D[2] ≥ ··· ≥ D[T ].  Now set j ← 1 and return to D2.  D5. [Merge.] If l = 0, sorting is complete and the output is on TAPE[1]. Other- wise, merge runs from TAPE[1], . . . , TAPE[P ] onto TAPE[T ] until TAPE[P ] is empty and D[P ] = 0. The merging process should operate as follows, for each run merged: If D[j] > 0 for all j, 1 ≤ j ≤ P, then increase D[T ] by 1 and decrease each D[j] by 1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ P; otherwise merge one run from each TAPE[j] such that D[j] = 0, and decrease D[j] by 1 for each other j.  Thus the dummy runs are imagined to be at the beginning of the tape instead of at the ending.   D6. [Down a level.] Set l ← l−1. Rewind TAPE[P ] and TAPE[T ].  Actually the rewinding of TAPE[P ] could have been initiated during step D5, just after its last block was input.  Then set  TAPE[1], TAPE[2], . . . , TAPE[T ]  ←  TAPE[T ], TAPE[1], . . . , TAPE[T − 1] ,  D[1], D[2], . . . , D[T ]  ←  D[T ], D[1], . . . , D[T − 1] , and return to step D5.  D1. Initialize  D2.

The order in which runs 34 through 65 are distributed to tapes, when advancing from level 4 to level 5.  See the table of perfect distributions, Eq.  1 .  Shaded areas represent the first 33 runs that were dis- tributed when level 4 was reached. The bottom row corresponds to the beginning of each tape.  The distribution rule that is stated so succinctly in step D3 of this algorithm is intended to equalize the number of dummies on each tape as well as possible. Figure 69 illustrates the order of distribution when we go from level 4  33 runs  to level 5  65 runs  in a six-tape sort; if there were only, say, 53 initial runs, all runs numbered 54 and higher would be treated as dummies.  The runs are actually being written at the end of the tape, but it is best to imagine them being written at the beginning, since the dummies are assumed to be at the beginning.  We have now discussed the first three questions listed above, and it remains to consider the number of “passes” over the data. Comparing our six-tape example to the table  1 , we see that the total number of initial runs processed when S = t6 was a5t1 + a4t2 + a3t3 + a2t4 + a1t5 + a0t6, excluding the initial distribution pass. Exercise 4 derives the generating functions  a z  = t z  =  n≥0  n≥1  1  anzn = 1 − z − z2 − z3 − z4 − z5 , tnzn = 5z + 4z2 + 3z3 + 2z4 + z5 1 − z − z2 − z3 − z4 − z5 .   7   It follows that, in general, the number of initial runs processed when S = tn is exactly the coefficient of zn in a z  t z , plus tn  for the initial distribution pass . This makes it possible to calculate the asymptotic behavior of polyphase merging, as shown in exercises 5 through 7, and we obtain the following results:  APPROXIMATE BEHAVIOR OF POLYPHASE MERGE SORTING  Tapes  Phases  Passes  Pass phase Growth ratio  Table 1  1.504 ln S + 0.992 1.015 ln S + 0.965 0.863 ln S + 0.921 0.795 ln S + 0.864 0.762 ln S + 0.797 0.744 ln S + 0.723 0.728 ln S + 0.568 0.721 ln S − 0.030  72% 62% 57% 54% 52% 51% 50% 50%  1.6180340 1.8392868 1.9275620 1.9659482 1.9835828 1.9919642 1.9980295 1.9999981  3 4 5 6 7 8 10 20  2.078 ln S + 0.672 1.641 ln S + 0.364 1.524 ln S + 0.078 1.479 ln S − 0.185 1.460 ln S − 0.424 1.451 ln S − 0.642 1.445 ln S − 1.017 1.443 ln S − 2.170  34 35 38 42 46 51 56 61 T1  36 39 43 47 52 57 62 T2  37 40 44 48 53 58 63 T3  41 45 49 54 59 64 T4  50 55 60 65 T5   5.4.2  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  273 In Table 1, the “growth ratio” is limn→∞ tn+1 tn, the approximate factor by which the number of runs increases at each level. “Passes” denotes the average number of times each record is processed, namely 1 S times the total number of initial runs processed during the distribution and merge phases. The stated number of passes and phases is correct in each case up to O S−ϵ , for some ϵ > 0, for perfect distributions as S → ∞.  Figure 70 shows the average number of times each record is merged, as a function of S, when Algorithm D is used to handle the case of nonperfect numbers. Note that with three tapes there are “peaks” of relative inefficiency occurring just after the perfect distributions, but this phenomenon largely dis- appears when there are four or more tapes. The use of eight or more tapes gives comparatively little improvement over six or seven tapes.  Fig. 70. Efficiency of polyphase merge using Algorithm D.  A closer look. In a balanced merge requiring k passes, every record is processed exactly k times during the course of the sort. But the polyphase procedure does not have this lack of bias; some records may get processed many more times than others, and we can gain speed if we arrange to put dummy runs into the oft-processed positions.  g n i g r e m e l i  h w ” s e s s a p “  f o  r e b m u N  14  13  12  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  T = 3  T = 4  T = 5  T = 6 T = 8 T = 10  1  2  5  10  20  50  100  200  500  1000 2000  5000  Initial runs, S   274  SORTING  5.4.2  . .

Figure 71 a  shows A5, B5, C5, D5, E5 tipped on end, showing how the merge numbers for each run appear on tape; notice, for example, that the run at the beginning of each tape will be processed five times, while the run at the end of T1 will be processed only once. This discriminatory practice of the polyphase merge makes it much better to put a dummy run at the beginning of the tape than at the end. Figure 71 b  shows an optimum order in which to distribute runs for a five-level polyphase merge, placing each new run into a position with the smallest available merge number. Algorithm D is not quite as good  see Fig. 69 , since it fills some “4” positions before all of the “3” positions are used up.  Fig. 71.

Further- more, the rule defining the A’s implies that essentially the same structure is present at the beginning of every level; we have An = n − Qn,   10   where Qn is a string of an values defined by the law  for n ≥ 1;  Qn = Qn−1 Qn−2 + 1  Qn−3 + 2  Qn−4 + 3  Qn−5 + 4 , Q0 = 0; for n < 0.   the empty string   Qn = ϵ   11  , whose first essentially characterizes all the  Since Qn begins with Qn−1, we can consider the infinite string Q∞ an elements are equal to Qn; this string Q∞ merge numbers in polyphase distribution.

Given that An is the string m1m2 . . . man, let  An x  = xm1 + xm2 + ··· + xman  be the corresponding generating function that counts the number of times each merge number appears; and define Bn x , Cn x , Dn x , En x  similarly. For example, A4 x  = x4 + x3 + x3 + x2 + x3 + x2 + x2 + x = x4 + 3x3 + 3x2 + x. Relations  9  tell us that  En x  = xAn−1 x , Dn x  = xAn−1 x  + An−2 x , Cn x  = xAn−1 x  + An−2 x  + An−3 x , Bn x  = xAn−1 x  + An−2 x  + An−3 x  + An−4 x , An x  = xAn−1 x  + An−2 x  + An−3 x  + An−4 x  + An−5 x , 1 − x z + z2 + z3 + z4 + z5  =   for n ≥ 1, where A0 x  = 1 and An x  = 0 for n = −1, −2, −3, −4.

We can use the functions Tn x  to determine the work involved when dummy runs are added in an optimum way. Let Σn m  be the sum of the smallest m merge numbers in an nth level distribution. These values are readily calculated by looking at the columns of  17 , and we find that Σn m  is given by  6  7  8  m = 1 2 3 4 5  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 5 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 1 2 3 4 8 10 12 14 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 6 1 2 3 4 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 24 27 30 33 36 ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ 7 1 2 3 5 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 29 32 35 38 41 44 47 1 2 4 6 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 32 35 38 41 44 47 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 23 26 29 32 35 38 41 44 47 50 53  n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 n = 4 n = 5 n = 6 n = 7 For example, if we wish to sort 17 runs using a level-3 distribution, the total amount of processing is Σ3 17  = 36; but if we use a level-4 or level-5 distribution   19    5.4.2  Level 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  277  NUMBER OF RUNS FOR WHICH A GIVEN LEVEL IS OPTIMUM T = 3  T = 10  T = 4 2 4 6 10 18 32 55 96 173 280 535 820 1635 2401 4959 7029 14953 20583 44899  T = 5 2 5 8 14 23 35 76 109 244 359 456 1197 1563 4034 5379 6456 18561 22876 64189  2 3 4 6 9 14 22 35 56 90 145 234 378 611 988 1598 2574 3955 6528  Table 2  T = 6 2 6 10 14 29 43 61 154 216 269 779 1034 1249 3910 4970 5841 19409 23918 27557  T = 7 2 7 12 17 20 53 73 98 283 386 481 555 1996 2486 2901 10578 13097 15336 17029  T = 8 2 8 14 20 24 27 88 115 148 168 640 792 922 1017 4397 5251 5979 6499 30164  T = 9 2 9 16 23 28 32 35 136 171 213 240 1002 1228 1432 1598 1713 8683 10069 11259  2 M1 10 M2 18 M3 26 M4 32 M5 37 M6 41 M7 44 M8 199 M9 243 M10 295 M11 330 M12 1499 M13 1818 M14 2116 M15 2374 M16 2576 M17 2709 M18 15787 M19  and position the dummy runs optimally, the total amount of processing during the merge phases is only Σ4 17  = Σ5 17  = 35. It is better to use level 4, even though 17 corresponds to a “perfect” level-3 distribution! Indeed, as S gets large it turns out that the optimum number of levels is many more than that used in Algorithm D. Exercise 14 proves that there is a nondecreasing sequence of numbers Mn such that level n is optimum for Mn ≤ S < Mn+1, but not for S ≥ Mn+1. In the six-tape case the table of Σn m  we have just calculated shows that M4 = 14.  M3 = 10,  M0 = 0,  M1 = 2,  M2 = 6,  The discussion above treats only the case of six tapes, but it is clear that the same ideas apply to polyphase merging with T tapes for any T ≥ 3; we simply replace 5 by P = T − 1 in all appropriate places. Table 2 shows the sequences Mn obtained for various values of T. Table 3 and Fig. 72 indicate the total number of initial runs that are processed after making an optimum distribution of dummy runs.  The formulas that appear at the bottom of Table 3 should be taken with a grain of salt, since they are least-squares fits over the range 1 ≤ S ≤ 5000, or 1 ≤ S ≤ 10000 for T = 3; this leads to somewhat erratic behavior because the given range of S values is not equally favorable for all T. As S → ∞, the number of initial runs processed after an optimum polyphase distribution is asymptotically S logP S, but convergence to this asymptotic limit is extremely slow.    278  SORTING  5.4.2  Fig. 72.

Fortunately, we rarely have to worry about large S  see Section 5.4.6 , so Algorithm D is not too bad in practice; in fact, it’s pretty good.  Polyphase sorting was first analyzed mathematically by W. C. Carter [Proc. IFIP Congress  1962 , 62–66]. Many of the results stated above about optimal dummy run placement are due originally to B. Sackman and T. Singer [“A vector model for merge sort analysis,” an unpublished paper presented at the ACM Sort Symposium  November 1962 , 21 pages]. Sackman later suggested the horizontal method of distribution used in Algorithm D. Donald Shell [CACM 14  1971 , 713–719; 15  1972 , 28] developed the theory independently, noted relation  10 , and made a detailed study of several different distribution algorithms. Further instructive developments and refinements have been made by Derek A. Zave [SICOMP 6  1977 , 1–39]; some of Zave’s results are discussed in exercises 15 through 17. The generating function  16  was first investigated by W. Burge [Proc. IFIP Congress  1971 , 1, 454–459]. But what about rewind time? So far we have taken “initial runs processed” as the sole measure of efficiency for comparing tape merge strategies. But after each of phases 2 through 6, in the examples at the beginning of this section, it is necessary for the computer to wait for two tapes to rewind; both the previous output tape and the new current output tape must be repositioned at the beginning, before the next phase can proceed. This can cause a significant delay, since the previous output tape generally contains a significant percentage of the records being sorted  see the “pass phase” column in Table 1 . It is a shame to have the computer twiddling its thumbs during all these rewind operations, since useful work could be done with the other tapes if we used a different merging pattern.  A simple modification of the polyphase procedure will overcome this prob- lem, although it requires at least five tapes [see Y. Césari, Thesis, U. of Paris  1968 , 25–27, where the idea is credited to J. Caron]. Each phase in Caron’s scheme merges runs from T − 3 tapes onto another tape, while the remaining two tapes are rewinding.   280  SORTING  5.4.2  For example, consider the case of six tapes and 49 initial runs.  In the following tableau, R denotes rewinding during the phase, and T5 is assumed to contain the original input: T3 Phase 113 15 — R 72 R 71 70 — R  8 × 3 = 24 5 × 3 = 15 4 × 5 = 20 2 × 7 = 14 2 × 11 = 22 1 × 15 = 15 1 × 23 = 23 0 × 33 = 0 1 × 49 = 49  49 − 17 = 32 max 8, 24  max 13, 15  max 17, 20  max 11, 14  max 22, 24  max 15, 15  max 20, 23   T1 111  R  16 12 — R 151 R 151  150   T5 — R 35 R 33 31 — R 330  R   T2 117 19 14 — R 112 R 111 111 —  T4 18 — R 54 R 52 51 — R 491  T6  R  38 R 34 32 — R 231 R  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  Rewind time  Write time   230   14  49  17  Here all the rewind time is essentially overlapped, except in phase 9  a “dummy phase” that prepares for the final merge , and after the initial distribution phase  when all tapes are rewound . If t is the time to merge the number of records in one initial run, and if r is the time to rewind over one initial run, this process takes about 182t+40r plus the time for initial distribution and final rewind. The corresponding figures for standard polyphase using Algorithm D are 140t+104r, which is slightly worse when r = 3  4 t, slightly better when r = 1 2 t.  Everything we have said about standard polyphase can be adapted to Caron’s  polyphase; for example, the sequence an now satisfies the recurrence   20  instead of  3 . The reader will find it instructive to analyze this method in the same way we analyzed standard polyphase, since it will enhance an understand- ing of both methods.  See, for example, exercises 19 and 20.   an = an−2 + an−3 + an−4  Table 5 gives statistics about Polyphase Caron that are analogous to the facts about Polyphase Ordinaire in Table 1. Notice that Caron’s method actually becomes superior to polyphase on eight or more tapes, in the number of runs processed as well as in the rewind time, even though it does  T −3 -way merging instead of  T − 1 -way merging!

As an extreme example, consider placing one run on T1 and n runs on T2, T3, T4, T5; if we alternately do five-way merging to T6 and T1 until T2, T3, T4, T5 are empty, the processing time is  2n2 + 3n  initial run lengths, essentially proportional to S2 instead of S log S, although five-way merging was done throughout. Tape splitting. Efficient overlapping of rewind time is a problem that arises in many applications, not just sorting, and there is a general approach that can often be used. Consider an iterative process that uses two tapes in the following way:  Phase 1  Phase 2  Phase 3  Phase 4  T1  Output 1 Rewind Input 1 Rewind Output 3 Rewind Input 3 Rewind  T2 — —  Output 2 Rewind Input 2 Rewind Output 4 Rewind  and so on, where “Output k” means write the kth output file and “Input k” means read it. The rewind time can be avoided when three tapes are used, as suggested by C. Weisert [CACM 5  1962 , 102]: T2 — —  Phase 1  T1  Phase 2  Phase 3  Phase 4  Output 1.1 Output 1.2 Rewind Input 1.1 Input 1.2 Rewind Output 3.1 Output 3.2 Rewind Input 3.1 Input 3.2 Rewind  Output 1.3 Output 2.1 Rewind Input 1.3 Input 2.1 Rewind Output 3.3 Output 4.1 Rewind Input 3.3  T3 — — — —  Output 2.2 Output 2.3 Rewind Input 2.2 Input 2.3 Rewind Output 4.2 Output 4.3  and so on. Here “Output k.j” means write the jth third of the kth output file, and “Input k.j” means read it. Virtually all of the rewind time will be eliminated if rewinding is at least twice as fast as the read write speed. Such a procedure, in which the output of each phase is divided between tapes, is called “tape splitting.”   282  SORTING  5.4.2  R. L. McAllester [CACM 7  1964 , 158–159] has shown that tape splitting leads to an efficient way of overlapping the rewind time in a polyphase merge. His method can be used with four or more tapes, and it does  T −2 -way merging. Assuming once again that we have six tapes, let us try to design a merge pattern that operates as follows, splitting the output on each level, where “I”, “O”, and “R”, respectively, denote input, output, and rewinding:  Level  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  T1 I I I I I I I I R O O R I I I I  T2 I I I I I I R O O R I I I I I I  T3 I I I I R O O R I I I I I I I I  T4 I I R O O R I I I I I I I I R O  T5 R O O R I I I I I I I I R O O R  T6 Number of runs output O R I I I I I I I I R O O R I I  u7 v7 u6 v6 u5 v5 u4 v4 u3 v3 u2 v2 u1 v1 u0 v0   21  In order to end with one run on T4 and all other tapes empty, we need to have  v0 = 1, u0 + v1 = 0, u1 + v2 = u0 + v0, u2 + v3 = u1 + v1 + u0 + v0, u3 + v4 = u2 + v2 + u1 + v1 + u0 + v0, u4 + v5 = u3 + v3 + u2 + v2 + u1 + v1 + u0 + v0, u5 + v6 = u4 + v4 + u3 + v3 + u2 + v2 + u1 + v1,  etc.; in general, the requirement is that un + vn+1 = un−1 + vn−1 + un−2 + vn−2 + un−3 + vn−3 + un−4 + vn−4 for all n ≥ 0, if we regard uj = vj = 0 for all j < 0.  There is no unique solution to these equations; indeed, if we let all the u’s be zero, we get the usual polyphase merge with one tape wasted! But if we choose un ≈ vn+1, the rewind time will be satisfactorily overlapped.   22   McAllester suggested taking  un = vn−1 + vn−2 + vn−3 + vn−4, vn+1 = un−1 + un−2 + un−3 + un−4,   5.4.2  so that the sequence  THE POLYPHASE MERGE  283  ⟨x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, . . .⟩ = ⟨v0, u0, v1, u1, v2, u2, . . .⟩  satisfies the uniform recurrence xn = xn−3 + xn−5 + xn−7 + xn−9. However, it turns out to be better to let  vn+1 = un−1 + vn−1 + un−2 + vn−2, un = un−3 + vn−3 + un−4 + vn−4;   23   this sequence not only leads to a slightly better merging time, it also has the great virtue that its merging time can be analyzed mathematically. McAllester’s choice is extremely difficult to analyze because runs of different lengths may occur during a single phase; we shall see that this does not happen with  23 .  We can deduce the number of runs on each tape on each level by working  backwards in the pattern  21 , and we obtain the following sorting scheme: Level  Write time Rewind time  T3 117 113 17 14 — R 73  T2 121 117 111 18 14 13 — R 131  T1 123 119 113 110 16 15 12 11 — R 191  T4 110 16 — R 44 4471 R 73131 4371 4271 131191 72131 4171 71 71131 71 191310 131191 71131 70 131 131 70 131 — 131  130191 191310 130191 191310 191310  310   191 191  190  — 821  R  R  R  T5 — R 46 49 R 48 45 44 43 42 41 41 — R 520  R 520820  R   T6 111 11144  82  R 1844 1444 1344 44 43 42 41 — R 311  4 × 4 = 16 6 × 4 = 24 3 × 4 = 12 4 × 4 = 16 1 × 7 = 7 3 × 7 = 21 1 × 13 = 13 1 × 13 = 13 1 × 19 = 19 1 × 19 = 19 0 × 31 = 0 1 × 31 = 31 0 × 52 = 0 0 × 52 = 0 0 × 82 = 0 311520  310520  1 × 82 = 82  311520  R    7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  82 − 23  23  27 10 36 17 23 21 34 23 32 27 19  0  max 36, 31, 23   Unoverlapped rewinding occurs in three places: when the input tape T5 is being rewound  82 units , during the first half of the level 2 phase  27 units , and during the final “dummy merge” phases in levels 1 and 0  36 units . So we may estimate the time as 273t + 145r; the corresponding amount for Algorithm D, 268t + 208r, is almost always inferior.

In general, when there are T ≥ 5 tapes, we let P = T − 2, and we define the sequences ⟨un⟩, ⟨vn⟩ by the rules  for n ≥ 0,  vn+1 = un−1 + vn−1 + ··· + un−r + vn−r, un = un−r−1 + vn−r−1 + ··· + un−P + vn−P ,   29  where r = ⌊P 2⌋; v0 = 1, and un = vn = 0 for n < 0. So if wn = un+vn, we have wn = wn−2 + ··· + wn−r + 2wn−r−1 + wn−r−2 + ··· + wn−P , for n > 0;  30  w0 = 1; and wn = 0 for n < 0. The initial distribution on tapes for level n + 1 places wn + wn−1 + ··· + wn−P +k runs on tape k, for 1 ≤ k ≤ P, and wn−1 + ··· + wn−r on tape T; tape T − 1 is used for input. Then un runs are merged to tape T while T − 1 is being rewound; vn are merged to T − 1 while T is rewinding; un−1 to T − 1 while T − 2 is rewinding; etc. Table 6 shows the approximate behavior of this procedure when S is not too small. The “pass phase” column indicates approximately how much of the entire file is being rewound during each half of a phase, and approximately how much of the file is being written during each full phase. The tape splitting method is superior to standard polyphase on six or more tapes, and probably also on five, at least for large S.

So the entries in Table 6 for T = 4 have been obtained by making a slight modification, letting v2 = 0, u1 = 1, v1 = 0, u0 = 0, v0 = 1, and vn+1 = un−1 + vn−1, un = un−2 + vn−2 for n ≥ 2. This leads to a very interesting sorting scheme  see exercises 25 and 26 .  EXERCISES 1.

See exercise 25.  27. [23] Once the initial runs have been distributed to tapes in a perfect distribution, the polyphase strategy is simply to “merge until empty”: We merge runs from all nonempty input tapes until one of them has been entirely read; then we use that tape as the next output tape, and let the previous output tape serve as an input.  Does this merge-until-empty strategy always sort, no matter how the initial runs are distributed, as long as we distribute them onto at least two tapes?  One tape will, of course, be left empty so that it can be the first output tape.  28. [M26] The previous exercise defines a rather large family of merging patterns. Show that polyphase is the best of them, in the following sense: If there are six tapes, and if we consider the class of all initial distributions  a, b, c, d, e  such that the merge- until-empty strategy requires at most n phases to sort, then a + b + c + d + e ≤ tn, where tn is the corresponding value for polyphase sorting  1 . 29. [M47] Exercise 28 shows that the polyphase distribution is optimal among all merge-until-empty patterns in the minimum-phase sense. But is it optimal also in the minimum-pass sense?  Let a be relatively prime to b, and assume that a + b is the Fibonacci number Fn. Prove or disprove the following conjecture due to R. M. Karp: The number of initial runs processed during the merge-until-empty pattern starting with distribution  a, b  is greater than or equal to   n− 5 Fn+1 +  2n + 2 Fn  5.  The latter figure is achieved when a = Fn−1, b = Fn−2.  30. [42] Prepare a table analogous to Table 2, for the tape-splitting polyphase merge. 31. [M22]  R. Kemp.

The Cascade Merge Another basic pattern, called the “cascade merge,” was actually discovered before polyphase [B. K. Betz and W. C. Carter, ACM National Meeting 14  1959 , Paper 14]. This approach is illustrated for six tapes and 190 initial runs in the following table, using the notation developed in Section 5.4.2:  Initial runs processed  T4 129 312 92 411 —  T3 141 29 123 291 —  T6 — 515 — 551 —  T5 115 414 ∗51 501 —  T1 155 — 155 — 1901  T2 150 ∗15 144 ∗151 —  190 190 190 190 190  Pass 1 Pass 2 Pass 3 Pass 4 Pass 5 A cascade merge, like polyphase, starts out with a “perfect distribution” of runs on tapes, although the rule for perfect distributions is somewhat different from those in Section 5.4.2. Each line in the table represents a complete pass over all the data. Pass 2, for example, is obtained by doing a five-way merge from {T1, T2, T3, T4, T5} to T6, until T5 is empty  this puts 15 runs of relative length 5 on T6 , then a four-way merge from {T1, T2, T3, T4} to T5, then a three-way merge to T4, a two-way merge to T3, and finally a one-way merge  a copying operation  from T1 to T2. Pass 3 is obtained in the same way, first doing a five-way merge until one tape becomes empty, then a four-way merge, and so on.  Perhaps the present section of this book should be numbered 5.4.3.2.1 instead of 5.4.3!   It is clear that the copying operations are unnecessary, and they could be omitted. Actually, however, in the six-tape case this copying takes only a small percentage of the total time. The items marked with an asterisk in the table above are those that were simply copied; only 25 of the 950 runs processed are of this type. Most of the time is devoted to five-way and four-way merging.

As we have observed in Section 5.4.2, a high order of merge is not a guarantee of efficiency. Table 1 shows the performance characteristics of cascade merge, by analogy with the similar tables in Section 5.4.2.  THE CASCADE MERGE  The “perfect distributions” for a cascade merge are easily derived by working  T1 1 1 5 15 55 190 . an  T2 0 1 4 14 50 175 . . bn  T3 0 1 3 12 41 146 . . cn  backwards from the final state  1, 0, . . . , 0 .

For example, the five diagonals in the hendecagon of Fig. 73 have relative lengths very nearly equal to 190, 175, 146, 105, and 55! We shall prove this remarkable fact later in this section, and we shall also see that the relative amount of time spent in  T−1 -way merging,  T −2 -way merging, . . . , 1-way merging is approximately proportional to the squares of the lengths of these diagonals.

Efficiency of cascade merge with the distribution of Algorithm D.  since cascade merging operates by complete passes; if we have 190 initial runs, each record is processed five times as in the example above, but if there are 191 we must apparently go up a level so that every record is processed six times. Fortunately this abrupt change is not actually necessary; David E. Ferguson has found a way to distribute initial runs so that many of the operations during the first merge pass reduce to copying the contents of a tape. When such copying relations are bypassed  by simply changing “logical” tape unit numbers relative to the “physical” numbers as in Algorithm 5.4.2D , we obtain a relatively smooth transition from level to level, as shown in Fig. 74. Suppose that  a, b, c, d, e  is a perfect distribution, where a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ e. By redefining the correspondence between logical and physical tape units, we can imagine that the distribution is actually  e, d, c, b, a , with a runs on T5, b on T4, etc. The next perfect distribution is  a+b+c+d+e, a+b+c+d, a+b+c, a+b, a ; and if the input is exhausted before we reach this next level, let us assume that the tapes contain, respectively,  D1, D2, D3, D4, D5  dummy runs, where  D1 ≤ a + b + c + d, D2 ≤ a + b + c, D3 ≤ a + b, D4 ≤ a, D5 = 0;  D1 ≥ D2 ≥ D3 ≥ D4 ≥ D5.   2   g n i g r e m e l i  h w ” s e s s a p “  f o  r e b m u N  14  13  12  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  T = 3  T = 4  T = 5  T = 6 T = 7 T = 8  T = 10  1  2  5  10  20  50  100  200  500  1000 2000  5000  Initial runs, S   5.4.3  THE CASCADE MERGE  291  We are free to imagine that the dummy runs appear in any convenient place on the tapes. The first merge pass is supposed to produce a runs by five-way merging, then b by four-way merging, etc., and our goal is to arrange the dummies so as to replace merging by copying. It is convenient to do the first merge pass as follows:  1. If D4 = a, subtract a from each of D1, D2, D3, D4 and pretend that T5 is the result of the merge. If D4 < a, merge a runs from tapes T1 through T5, using the minimum possible number of dummies on tapes T1 through T5 so that the new values of D1, D2, D3, D4 will satisfy  D1 ≤ b + c + d, D2 ≤ b + c, D3 ≤ b, D4 = 0;   3  Thus, if D2 was originally ≤ b + c, we use no dummies from it at this step, while if b + c < D2 ≤ a + b + c we use exactly D2 − b − c of them.  D1 ≥ D2 ≥ D3 ≥ D4.  2.  This step is similar to step 1, but “shifted.”  If D3 = b, subtract b from each of D1, D2, D3 and pretend that T4 is the result of the merge. If D3 < b, merge b runs from tapes T1 through T4, reducing the number of dummies if necessary in order to make  D1 ≤ c + d, D2 ≤ c, D3 = 0;  D1 ≥ D2 ≥ D3.  3. And so on.

Assume that “logical” tapes  T1, . . . , T5  contain respectively  5, 9, 12, 14, 15  runs and that we want eventually to bring this up to  55, 50, 41, 29, 15 . The procedure can be summa- rized as shown in Table 2. We first put nine runs on T1, then  3, 12  on T1 and T2, etc. If the input becomes exhausted during, say, Step  3,2 , then the “amount saved” is 15 + 9 + 5, meaning that the five-way merge of 15 runs, the two-way merge of 9 runs, and the one-way merge of 5 runs are avoided by the dummy run assignment. In other words, 15 + 9 + 5 of the runs present at level 3 are not processed during the first merge phase.   reached.  tape unit number j.  unit number j.  tape unit number j.  292  SORTING  5.4.3  The following algorithm defines the process in detail.  Algorithm C  Cascade merge sorting with special distribution . This algorithm takes initial runs and disperses them to tapes, one run at a time, until the supply of initial runs is exhausted. Then it specifies how the tapes are to be merged, assuming that there are T ≥ 3 available tape units, using at most  T − 1 -way merging and avoiding unnecessary one-way merging. Tape T may be used to hold the input, since it does not receive any initial runs. The following tables are maintained:  A[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: The perfect cascade distribution we have most recently  AA[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: The perfect cascade distribution we are striving for. D[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: Number of dummy runs assumed to be present on logical  M[j], 1 ≤ j < T: Maximum number of dummy runs desired on logical tape  TAPE[j], 1 ≤ j ≤ T: Number of the physical tape unit corresponding to logical  C1. [Initialize.] Set A[k] ← AA[k] ← D[k] ← 0 for 2 ≤ k ≤ T; and set A[1] ← 0, AA[1] ← 1, D[1] ← 1. Set TAPE[k] ← k for 1 ≤ k ≤ T. Finally set i ← T − 2, j ← 1, k ← 1, l ← 0, m ← 1, and go to step C5.  This maneuvering is one way to get everything started, by jumping right into the inner loop with appropriate settings of the control variables.   C2. [Begin new level.]  We have just reached a perfect distribution, and since there is more input we must get ready for the next level.  Increase l by 1. Set A[k] ← AA[k], for 1 ≤ k ≤ T; then set AA[T − k] ← AA[T − k + 1]+A[k], for k = 1, 2, . . . , T −1 in this order. Set  TAPE[1], . . . , TAPE[T −1]  ←  TAPE[T −1], . . . , TAPE[1] , and set D[k] ← AA[k + 1] for 1 ≤ k < T. Finally set i ← 1.  C3. [Begin ith sublevel.] Set j ← i.  The variables i and j represent “Step   i, j ” in the example shown in Table 2.   C4. [Begin Step  i, j .] Set k ← j and m ← A[T − j − 1]. If m = 0 and i = j, set i ← T − 2 and return to C3; if m = 0 and i ̸= j, return to C2.  Variable m represents the number of runs to be written onto TAPE[k]; m = 0 occurs only when l = 1.   C5.

Otherwise increase i by 1; if i < T − 1, return to C3. Otherwise go to C2.   5.4.3  THE CASCADE MERGE  293  Fig. 75. The cascade merge, with special distribution.  C7. [Prepare to merge.]  At this point the initial distribution is complete, and the AA, D, and TAPE tables describe the present states of the tapes.  Set M[k] ← AA[k + 1] for 1 ≤ k < T, and set FIRST ← 1.  Variable FIRST is nonzero only during the first merge pass.   C8. [Cascade.] If l = 0, stop; sorting is complete and the output is on TAPE[1]. Otherwise, for p = T −1, T −2, . . . , 1, in this order, do a p-way merge from TAPE[1], . . . , TAPE[p] to TAPE[p + 1] as follows: If p = 1, simulate the one-way merge by simply rewinding TAPE[2], then interchanging TAPE[1] ↔ TAPE[2]. Otherwise if FIRST = 1 and D[p − 1] = M[p − 1], simulate the p-way merge by simply interchanging TAPE[p] ↔ TAPE[p + 1], rewinding TAPE[p], and subtracting M[p − 1] from each of D[1], . . . , D[p−1], M[1], . . . , M[p−1]. Otherwise, subtract M[p − 1] from each of M[1], . . . , M[p − 1]. Then merge one run from each TAPE[j] such that 1 ≤ j ≤ p and D[j] ≤ M[j]; subtract one from each D[j] such that 1 ≤ j ≤ p and D[j] > M[j]; and put the output run on TAPE[p + 1]. Continue doing this until TAPE[p] is empty. Then rewind TAPE[p] and TAPE[p + 1].  C9.

The cascade merge is somewhat harder to analyze than polyphase, but the analysis is especially interesting because so many remarkable formulas are present. Readers who enjoy discrete mathematics are urged to study the cascade distribution for themselves, before reading further, since the numbers have extraordinary properties that are a pleasure to discover. We shall discuss here one of the many ways to approach the analysis, emphasizing the way in which the results might be discovered.  For convenience, let us consider the six-tape case, looking for formulas that  0  0  2  =0 generalize to all T. Relations  1  lead to the first basic pattern: an = an =1 bn = an−en−1 = an−an−2 =2 cn = bn−dn−1 = bn−an−2−bn−2 =3 dn = cn−cn−1 = cn−an−2−bn−2−cn−2 = dn−an−2−bn−2−cn−2−dn−2 =4 en = dn−bn−1 Let A z  = n≥0 anzn, . . . , E z  =  − m + 1  m   m + k  =  an, an−2 an−3 an−4 an−5  m + 2 n≥0 enzn, and define the polynomials m  an−2, an−2+4 an−2+5 an−2+6  2m − k  an−4, an−4−6 an−4−7  an−6, an−6+8  2  −1 kz2k =   −1 m−kz2m−2k.  z4 − ···  qm z  =  z2 +    4  0  8  4  4  6  4  6  2  0  2  2  0  0  an−8.   4    5   2k  k  k=0  k  The result of  4  can be summarized by saying that the generating functions B z  − q1 z A z , C z  − q2 z A z , D z  − q3 z A z , and E z  − q4 z A z  reduce to finite sums, corresponding to the values of a−1, a−2, a−3, . . . that appear in  4  for small n but do not appear in A z . In order to supply appropriate boundary conditions, let us run the recurrence backwards to negative levels, through level −8:  n 0 −1 −2 −3 −4 −5 −6 −7 −8  an 1 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 14  bn 0 0 −1 0 −3 0 −9 −1 −28  cn 0 0 0 0 1 1 5 6 20  dn 0 0 0 −1 0 −4 −1 −14 −7  en 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 14 1    6    7   5.4.3  THE CASCADE MERGE  295   On seven tapes the table would be similar, with entries for odd n shifted right one column.  The sequence a0, a−2, a−4, . . . = 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, . . . is a dead giveaway for computer scientists, since it occurs in connection with so many recursive algorithms  see, for example, exercise 2.2.1–4 and Eq. 2.3.4.4– 14  ; therefore we conjecture that in the T-tape case  2n   1  n + 1 ,  n  a−2n =  a−2n−1 = 0,  for 0 ≤ n ≤ T − 2; for 0 ≤ n ≤ T − 3.  To verify that this choice is correct, it suffices to show that  6  and  4  yield the correct results for levels 0 and 1. On level 1 this is obvious, and on level 0 we have to verify that   m    a0 − m + 1    0  2  a−2 +   m + 2    4  a−4 − m + 3   −1 k 2k  m + k a−6 + ··· = k + 1 = δm0  2k  6  k  k≥0  for 0 ≤ m ≤ T − 2. Fortunately this sum can be evaluated by standard tech- niques; it is, in fact, Example 2 in Section 1.2.6. Now we can compute the coefficients of B z − q1 z A z , etc. For example, consider the coefficient of z2m in D z  − q3 z A z : It is  3 + m + k    2m + 2k   −1 m+ka−2k =    k≥0  2m + 2k   −1 m+k 2k 3 + m + k  −3 + m  2 + m  =  −1 m+12 + m   =  −1 m  2m − 1  k + 1  k≥0  2m  k  ,  2m  by the result of Example 3 in Section 1.2.6. Therefore we have deduced that  A z  = q0 z A z , B z  = q1 z A z  − q0 z , D z  = q3 z A z  − q2 z ,  C z  = q2 z A z  − q1 z , E z  = q4 z A z  − q3 z .   8   Furthermore we have en+1 = an; hence zA z  = E z , and  A z  = q3 z  q4 z  − z.   9  The generating functions have now been derived in terms of the q polyno- mials, and so we want to understand the q’s better. Exercise 1.2.9–15 is useful in this regard, since it gives us a closed form that may be written     4 − z2 + iz  22m+1 +   √  4 − z2 − iz  22m+1  .   10   qm z  =  √ 4 − z2  √   296  SORTING  5.4.3  Everything simplifies if we now set z = 2 sin θ: qm 2 sin θ  =  cos θ+ i sin θ 2m+1 + cos θ− i sin θ 2m+1  This coincidence leads us to suspect that the polynomial qm z  is well known in mathematics; and indeed, a glance at appropriate tables will show that qm z  is essentially a Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind, namely  −1 mU2m z 2  in conventional notation.  We can now determine the roots of the denominator in  9 : The equation  = cos 2m+1 θ  2 cos θ  cos θ   11   .  q4 2 sin θ  = 2 sin θ reduces to  cos 9θ = 2 sin θ cos θ = sin 2θ.  14 π, 2 sin 3  14 π, 2 sin −1  We can obtain solutions to this relation whenever ±9θ = 2θ +  2n − 1 2 π; and all such θ yield roots of the denominator in  9  provided that cos θ ̸= 0.  When cos θ = 0, qm ±2  =  2m + 1  is never equal to ±2.  The following eight distinct roots for q4 z  − z = 0 are therefore obtained: 22 π, 2 sin −3 2 sin −5 22 π. Since q4 z  is a polynomial of degree 8, this accounts for all the roots. The first three of these values make q3 z  = 0, so q3 z  and q4 z  − z have a polynomial of degree three as a common factor. The other five roots govern the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of A z , if we expand  9  in partial fractions. Considering the general T-tape case, let θk =  4k + 1 π  4T − 2 . The generating function A z  for the T-tape cascade distribution numbers takes the form  14 π; 2 sin −7  22 π, 2 sin 1  22 π, 2 sin 5  22 π, 2 sin 9  4  2T − 1  −T  2<k<⌊T  2⌋  cos2 θk  1 − z  2 sin θk    see exercise 8 ; hence  an =  4  2T − 1  cos2 θk  −T  2<k<⌊T  2⌋  The equations in  8  now lead to the similar formulas   12    13    14   n  2 sin θk   1  1  1  1  2 sin θk  2 sin θk  2 sin θk  .  n n n  ,  ,  ,  4  4  4  bn =  2T − 1  cn =  2T − 1  dn =  2T − 1  cos θk cos 3θk  cos θk cos 5θk  cos θk cos 7θk  −T  2<k<⌊T  2⌋  −T  2<k<⌊T  2⌋  −T  2<k<⌊T  2⌋        and so on. Exercise 9 shows that these equations hold for all n ≥ 0, not only for large n. In each sum the term for k = 0 dominates all the others, especially   5.4.3  THE CASCADE MERGE  297  when n is reasonably large; therefore the “growth ratio” is + O T −2 .  T − 1  = 2  1  + π 48T  π  2 sin θ0  π   15   Cascade sorting was first analyzed by W. C. Carter [Proc. IFIP Congress  1962 , 62–66], who obtained numerical results for small T, and by David E. Ferguson [see CACM 7  1964 , 297], who discovered the first two terms in the asymptotic behavior  15  of the growth ratio. During the summer of 1964, R. W. Floyd discovered the explicit form 1  2 sin θ0  of the growth ratio, so that exact formulas could be used for all T. An intensive analysis of the cascade numbers was independently carried out by G. N. Raney [Canadian J. Math. 18  1966 , 332–349], who came across them in quite another way having nothing to do with sorting. Raney observed the “ratio of diagonals” principle of Fig. 73, and derived many other interesting properties of the numbers. Floyd and Raney used matrix manipulations in their proofs  see exercise 6 . Modifications of cascade sorting. If one more tape is added, it is possible to overlap nearly all of the rewind time during a cascade sort. For example, we can merge T1–T5 to T7, then T1–T4 to T6, then T1–T3 to T5  which by now is rewound , then T1–T2 to T4, and the next pass can begin when the comparatively short data on T4 has been rewound. The efficiency of this process can be predicted from the analysis of cascading.  See Section 5.4.6 for further information.   A “compromise merge” scheme, which includes both polyphase and cascade as special cases, was suggested by D. E. Knuth in CACM 6  1963 , 585–587. Each phase consists of  T − 1 -way,  T − 2 -way, . . . , P-way merges, where P is any fixed number between 1 and T − 1. When P = T − 1, this is polyphase, and when P = 1 it is pure cascade; when P = 2 it is cascade without copy phases. Analyses of this scheme have been made by C. E. Radke [IBM Systems J. 5  1966 , 226–247] and by W. H. Burge [Proc. IFIP Congress  1971 , 1, 454–  459]. Burge found the generating function Tn x zn for each  P, T  compromise  merge, generalizing Eq. 5.4.2– 16 ; he showed that the best value of P, from the standpoint of fewest initial runs processed as a function of S as S → ∞  using a straightforward distribution scheme and ignoring rewind time , is respectively  2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4  for T =  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 . These values of P lean more towards cascade than polyphase as T increases; and it turns out that the compromise merge is never substantially better than cascade itself. On the other hand, with an optimum choice of levels and optimum distribution of dummy runs, as described in Section 5.4.2, pure polyphase seems to be best of all the compromise merges; unfortunately the optimum distribution is comparatively difficult to implement.  Th. L. Johnsen [BIT 6  1966 , 129–143] has studied a combination of bal- anced and polyphase merging; a rewind-overlap variation of balanced merging has been proposed by M. A. Goetz [Digital Computer User’s Handbook, edited by M. Klerer and G. A. Korn  New York: McGraw–Hill, 1967 , 1.311–1.312]; and many other hybrid schemes can be imagined.   298  SORTING  5.4.3  EXERCISES 1.

An “nth level cascade distribution” is a multiset defined as follows  in the case of six tapes : {1, 0, 0, 0, 0} is a 0th level cascade distribution; and if {a, b, c, d, e} is an nth level cascade distribution, {a+b+c+d+e, a+b+c+d, a+b+c, a+b, a} is an  n + 1 st level cascade distribution.  A multiset is unordered, hence up to 5! different  n + 1 st level distributions can be formed from a single nth level distribution.  a  Prove that any multiset {a, b, c, d, e} of relatively prime integers is an nth level  cascade distribution, for some n. b  Prove that the distribution defined for cascade sorting is optimum, in the sense that, if {a, b, c, d, e} is any nth level distribution with a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ e, we have a ≤ an, b ≤ bn, c ≤ cn, d ≤ dn, e ≤ en, where  an, bn, cn, dn, en  is the distribution defined in  1 .   cid:120  5.

[M40] Prove that Ferguson’s distribution scheme is optimum, in the sense that no method of placing the dummy runs, satisfying  2 , will cause fewer initial runs to be processed during the first pass, provided that the strategy of steps C7–C9 is used during this pass. 13. [40] The text suggests overlapping most of the rewind time, by adding an extra tape. Explore this idea.  For example, the text’s scheme involves waiting for T4 to rewind; would it be better to omit T4 from the first merge phase of the next pass?   *5.4.4. Reading Tape Backwards Many magnetic tape units have the ability to read tape in the opposite direction from which it was written. The merging patterns we have encountered so far always write information onto tape in the “forward” direction, then rewind the tape, read it forwards, and rewind again. The tape files therefore behave as queues, operating in a first-in-first-out manner. Backwards reading allows us to eliminate both of these rewind operations: We write the tape forwards and read it backwards. In this case the files behave as stacks, since they are used in a last-in-first-out manner.  The balanced, polyphase, and cascade merge patterns can all be adapted to backward reading. The main difference is that merging reverses the order of the runs when we read backwards and write forwards. If two runs are in ascending order on tape, we can merge them while reading backwards, but this produces descending order. The descending runs produced in this way will subsequently become ascending on the next pass; so the merging algorithms must be capable of dealing with runs in either order. Programmers who are confronted with read-backwards for the first time often feel like they are standing on their heads! As an example of backwards reading, consider the process of merging 8 initial runs, using a balanced merge on four tapes. The operations can be summarized as follows:  T1  T2  T3 —  T4 —  — —  D2D2  — D8  — A4 —  — A4 —  A1A1A1A1  A1A1A1A1  Initial distribution  Pass 1 Pass 2 Pass 3 Pass 4 Here Ar stands for a run of relative length r that appears on tape in ascending order, if the tape is read forwards as in our previous examples; Dr is the corresponding notation for a descending run of length r. During Pass 2 the ascending runs become descending: They appear to be descending in the input, since we are reading T1 and T2 backwards. Then the runs switch orientation again on Pass 3.  D2D2 Merge to T3 and T4 Merge to T1 and T2 Final merge to T3  Notice that the process above finishes with the result on tape T3, in de- scending order. If this is bad  depending on whether the output is to be read   300  SORTING  5.4.4  backwards, or to be dismounted and put away for future use , we could copy it to another tape, reversing the direction. A faster way would be to rewind T1 and T2 after Pass 3, producing A8 during Pass 4. Still faster would be to start with eight descending runs during Pass 1, since this would interchange all the A’s and D’s. However, the balanced merge on 16 initial runs would require the initial runs to be ascending; and we usually don’t know in advance how many initial runs will be formed, so it is necessary to choose one consistent direction. Therefore the idea of rewinding after Pass 3 is probably best.  The cascade merge carries over in the same way. For example, consider  sorting 14 initial runs on four tapes:  T4 —  T1  T2  T3  — A6 —  A1A1A1A1A1  A1A1A1A1A1A1  A1A1A1 D2D2  Pass 1 Pass 2 Pass 3 Pass 4 Again, we could produce A14 instead of D14, if we rewound T1, T2, T3 just before the final pass. This tableau illustrates a “pure” cascade merge, in the sense that all of the one-way merges have been performed explicitly. If we had suppressed the copying operations, as in Algorithm 5.4.3C, we would have been confronted with the situation  — D14  D1 A5 —  D3D3D3  A3 —  —  A1  D2D2  D3D3D3 after Pass 2, and it would have been impossible to continue with a three-way merge since we cannot merge runs that are in opposite directions! The operation of copying T1 to T2 could be avoided if we rewound T1 and proceeded to read it forward during the next merge phase  while reading T3 and T4 backwards . But it would then be necessary to rewind T1 again after merging, so this trick trades one copy for two rewinds.  Thus the distribution method of Algorithm 5.4.3C does not work as efficient- ly for read-backwards as for read-forwards; the amount of time required jumps rather sharply every time the number of initial runs passes a “perfect” cas- cade distribution number. Another dispersion technique can be used to give a smoother transition between perfect cascade distributions  see exercise 17 . Read-backward polyphase. At first glance  and even at second and third glance , the polyphase merge scheme seems to be totally unfit for reading back- wards. For example, suppose that we have 13 initial runs and three tapes: T3 —  Phase 1 Phase 2 D2D2D2D2D2 Now we’re stuck; we could rewind either T2 or T3 and then read it forwards, while reading the other tape backwards, but this would jumble things up and we would have gained comparatively little by reading backwards.  A1A1A1A1A1A1A1A1 A1A1A1  A1A1A1A1A1  T2  T1  —   5.4.4  READING TAPE BACKWARDS  301  An ingenious idea that saves the situation is to alternate the direction of  runs on each tape. Then the merging can proceed in perfect synchronization:  T3 —  T1  T2  —  — A13  — D8 —  A1D1A1D1A1  A3D3A3 A3  — D5A5 D5 —  D2A2D2A2D2 D2A2  D1A1D1A1D1A1D1A1 D1A1D1  Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Phase 5 Phase 6 This principle was mentioned briefly by R. L. Gilstad in his original article on polyphase merging, and he described it more fully in CACM 6  1963 , 220–223. The ADA . . . technique works properly for polyphase merging on any num- ber of tapes; for we can show that the A’s and D’s will be properly synchronized at each phase, provided only that the initial distribution pass produces alter- nating A’s and D’s on each tape and that each tape ends with A  or each tape ends with D : Since the last run written on the output file during one phase is in the opposite direction from the last runs used from the input files, the next phase always finds its runs in the proper orientation. Furthermore we have seen in exercise 5.4.2–13 that most of the perfect Fibonacci distributions call for an odd number of runs on one tape  the eventual output tape , and an even number of runs on each other tape. If T1 is designated as the final output tape, we can therefore guarantee that all tapes end with an A run, if we start T1 with an A and let the remaining tapes start with a D. A distribution method analogous to Algorithm 5.4.2D can be used, modified so that the distributions on each level have T1 as the final output tape.  We skip levels 1, T +1, 2T +1, . . . , since they are the levels in which the initially empty tape is the final output tape.  For example, in the six-tape case, we can use the following distribution numbers in place of 5.4.2– 1 :  Level  0 2 3 4 5 6 8  T1 1 1 3 7 15 31 61  T2 0 2 4 8 16 30 120  T3 0 2 4 8 14 28 116  T4 0 2 4 6 12 24 108  T5 0 2 2 4 8 16 92  Total 1 9 17 33 65 129 497  Final output will be on  T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1   1   Thus, T1 always gets an odd number of runs, while T2 through T5 get the even numbers, in decreasing order for flexibility in dummy run assignment. Such a distribution has the advantage that the final output tape is known in advance, regardless of the number of initial runs that happen to be present. It turns out  see exercise 3  that the output will always appear in ascending order on T1 when this scheme is used.   302  SORTING  5.4.4  Another way to handle the distribution for read-backward polyphase has been suggested by D. T. Goodwin and J. L. Venn [CACM 7  1964 , 315]. We can distribute runs almost as in Algorithm 5.4.2D, beginning with a D run on each tape. When the input is exhausted, a dummy A run is imagined to be at the beginning of the unique “odd” tape, unless a distribution with all odd numbers has been reached. Other dummies are imagined at the end of the tapes, or grouped into pairs in the middle. The question of optimum placement of dummy runs is analyzed in exercise 5 below. Optimum merge patterns. So far we have been discussing various patterns for merging on tape, without asking for “best possible” methods. It appears to be quite difficult to determine the optimal patterns, especially in the read- forward case where the interaction of rewind time with merge time is hard to handle. On the other hand, when merging is done by reading backwards and writing forwards, all rewinding is essentially eliminated, and it is possible to get a fairly good characterization of optimal ways to merge. Richard M. Karp has introduced some very interesting approaches to this problem, and we shall conclude this section by discussing the theory he has developed.  In the first place we need a more satisfactory way to describe merging patterns, instead of the rather mysterious tape-content tableaux that have been used above. Karp has suggested two ways to do this, the vector representation and the tree representation of a merge pattern. Both forms of representation are useful in practice, so we shall describe them in turn.  The vector representation of a merge pattern consists of a sequence of “merge vectors” y m  . . . y 1  y 0 , each of which has T components. The ith-last merge step is represented by y i  in the following way:  if tape number j is an input to the merge; if tape number j is not used in the merge; if tape number j gets the output of the merge.   2   Thus, exactly one component of y i  is −1, and the other components are 0s and 1s. The final vector y 0  is special; it is a unit vector, having 1 in position j if the final sorted output appears on unit j, and 0 elsewhere. These definitions imply that the vector sum  v i  = y i  + y i−1  + ··· + y 0    3  represents the distribution of runs on tape just before the ith-last merge step, with v In particular, v m  tells how many runs the initial distribution pass places on each tape.  runs on tape j.  It may seem awkward to number these vectors backwards, with y m  coming first and y 0  last, but this peculiar viewpoint turns out to be advantageous for developing the theory. One good way to search for an optimal method is to start with the sorted output and to imagine “unmerging” it to various tapes, then unmerging these, etc., considering the successive distributions v 0 , v 1 , v 2 , . . . in the reverse order from which they actually occur during the sorting process.   i  j   +1,  0, −1,   i  j =  y   5.4.4  READING TAPE BACKWARDS  303  In fact that is essentially the approach we have taken already in our analysis of polyphase and cascade merging.  The three merge patterns described in tabular form earlier in this section  have the following vector representations: Balanced  T = 4, S = 8  v 7  =   4, 4, 0, 0  y 7  =  +1, +1,−1, 0  y 6  =  +1, +1, 0,−1  y 5  =  +1, +1,−1, 0  y 4  =  +1, +1, 0,−1  y 3  =  −1, 0, +1, +1  y 2  =   0,−1, +1, +1  y 1  =  +1, +1,−1, 0  y 0  =   0, 0, 1, 0   Cascade  T = 4, S = 14  v 10  =   6, 5, 3, 0  y 10  =  +1, +1, +1,−1  y 9  =  +1, +1, +1,−1  y 8  =  +1, +1, +1,−1  y 7  =  +1, +1,−1, 0  y 6  =  +1, +1,−1, 0  y 5  =  +1,−1, 0, 0  y 4  =  −1, +1, +1, +1  y 3  =   0,−1, +1, +1  y 2  =   0, 0,−1, +1  y 1  =  +1, +1, +1,−1  y 0  =   0, 0, 0, 1   Polyphase  T = 3, S = 13   v 12  =   5, 8, 0  y 12  =  +1, +1,−1  y 11  =  +1, +1,−1  y 10  =  +1, +1,−1  y 9  =  +1, +1,−1  y 8  =  +1, +1,−1  y 7  =  −1, +1, +1  y 6  =  −1, +1, +1  y 5  =  −1, +1, +1  y 4  =  +1,−1, +1  y 3  =  +1,−1, +1  y 2  =  +1, +1,−1  y 1  =  −1, +1, +1  y 0  =   1, 0, 0   Every merge pattern obviously has a vector representation. Conversely, it is easy to see that the sequence of vectors y m  . . . y 1  y 0  corresponds to an actual merge pattern if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:  i  y 0  is a unit vector. ii  y i  has exactly one component equal to −1, all other components equal to  0 or +1, for m ≥ i ≥ 1.  iii  All components of y i  + ··· + y 1  + y 0  are nonnegative, for m ≥ i ≥ 1.  The tree representation of a merge pattern gives another picture of the same information. We construct a tree with one external leaf node for each initial run, and one internal node for each run that is merged, in such a way that the descendants of each internal node are the runs from which it was fabricated. Each internal node is labeled with the step number on which the corresponding run was formed, numbering steps backwards as in the vector representation; furthermore, the line just above each node is labeled with the name of the tape on which that run appears. For example, the three merge patterns above have the tree representations depicted in Fig. 76, if we call the tapes A, B, C, D instead of T1, T2, T3, T4.  This representation displays many of the relevant properties of the merge pattern in convenient form; for example, if the run on level 0 of the tree  the root  is to be ascending, then the runs on level 1 must be descending, those on level 2 must be ascending, etc.; an initial run is ascending if and only if the corresponding external node is on an even-numbered level. Furthermore the total number of initial runs processed during the merging  not including the initial distribution  is exactly equal to the external path length of the tree, since each initial run on level k is processed exactly k times.   304  SORTING  5.4.4  Fig. 76. Tree representations of three merge patterns.  Every merge pattern has a tree representation, but not every tree defines a merge pattern. A tree whose internal nodes have been labeled with the numbers 1 through m, and whose lines have been labeled with tape names, represents a valid read-backward merge pattern if and only if a  no two lines adjacent to the same internal node have the same tape name; b  if i > j, and if A is a tape name, the tree does not contain the configuration  ;  c  if i < j < k < l, and if A is a tape name, the tree does not contain  both  and  or  both  and  .   4   Balanced  T = 4, S = 8   C  1  A  3  B  2  C  5  D  4  C  7  D  6  A B A B A B A B  Cascade  T = 4, S = 14   D  1  C  7  B  3  C  D  9  2  D  10  A  D  8  4  B  5  C  6  A A  B  A B  C  A  B  A B  C A B  C  Polyphase  T = 3, S = 13   A  1  B  4  C  11  A  5  C  10  B  A  B  B  C  2  A  7  C  8  A  B  A  B  B  A  B  C  12  B  3  A  6  C  9  A  B  A  i  j  A  i  k  A  j  l  A  i  k  j  A   5.4.4  READING TAPE BACKWARDS  305  Condition  a  is self-evident, since the input and output tapes in a merge must be distinct; similarly,  b  is obvious. The “no crossover” condition  c  mirrors the last-in-first-out restriction that characterizes read-backward operations on tape: The run formed at step k must be removed before any runs formed previously on that same tape; hence the configurations in  4  are impossible. It is not difficult to verify that any labeled tree satisfying conditions  a ,  b ,  c  does indeed correspond to a read-backward merge pattern. If there are T tape units, condition  a  implies that the degree of each internal node is T − 1 or less. It is not always possible to attach suitable labels to all such trees; for example, when T = 3 there is no merge pattern whose tree has the shape  This shape would lead to an optimal merge pattern if we could attach step numbers and tape names in a suitable way, since it is the only way to achieve the minimum external path length in a tree having four external nodes. But there is essentially only one way to do the labeling according to conditions  a  and  b , because of the symmetries of the diagram, namely,   5    6   and this violates condition  c . A shape that can be labeled according to the conditions above, using at most T tape names, is called a T-lifo tree.  Another way to characterize all labeled trees that can arise from merge patterns is to consider how all such trees can be “grown.” Start with some tape name, say A, and with the seedling  .  Step number i in the tree’s growth consists of choosing distinct tape names B, B1, B2, . . . , Bk, and changing the most recently formed external node corre-  A  1  B  2  C  3  A  AC  B  A   306  SORTING  sponding to B  from  to  .   7   This “last formed, first grown on” rule explains how the tree representation can be constructed directly from the vector representation.  The determination of strictly optimum T-tape merge patterns — that is, of T-lifo trees whose path length is minimum for a given number of external nodes — seems to be quite difficult. For example, the following nonobvious pattern turns out to be an optimum way to merge seven initial runs on four tapes, reading backwards:  5.4.4   8   A one-way merge is actually necessary to achieve the optimum!  See exercise 8.  On the other hand, it is not so difficult to give constructions that are asymptot- ically optimal, for any fixed T.  Let KT  n  be the minimum external path length achievable in a T-lifo tree with n external nodes. From the theory developed in Section 2.3.4.5, it is not difficult to prove that  KT  n  ≥ nq − T − 1 q − n  T − 2 ,   9  since this is the minimum external path length of any tree with n external nodes and all nodes of degree < T. At the present time comparatively few values of KT  n  are known exactly. Here are some upper bounds that are probably exact:  q = ⌈logT−1 n⌉,  n = 1 2 3 4  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 K3 n  ≤ 0 2 5 9 12 16 21 25 30 34 39 45 50 56 61 K4 n  ≤ 0 2 3 6 8 11 14 17 20 24 27 31 33 37 40  6  7  5  8   10   Karp discovered that any tree whose internal nodes have degrees < T is almost T-lifo, in the sense that it can be made T-lifo by changing some of the external nodes to one-way merges. In fact, the construction of a suitable labeling is fairly simple. Let A be a particular tape name, and proceed as follows:  B  B  i  B1  B2  · · ·  Bk  A  1  C  4  B  D  CA  AD  DB  2  3  A   5.4.4  READING TAPE BACKWARDS  307  Step 1. Attach tape names to the lines of the tree diagram, in any manner consistent with condition  a  above, provided that the special name A is used only in the leftmost line of a branch. Step 2. Replace each external node of the form  by  whenever B ̸= A. Step 3. Number the internal nodes of the tree in preorder. The result will be a labeling satisfying conditions  a ,  b , and  c .  For example, if we start with the tree  and three tapes, this procedure might assign labels as follows:   11    12   It is not difficult to verify that Karp’s construction satisfies the “last formed, first grown on” discipline, because of the nature of preorder  see exercise 12 .  The result of this construction is a merge pattern for which all of the initial runs appear on tape A. This suggests the following distribution and sorting scheme, which we may call the preorder merge:  B  B  A  A  1  B  2  C  8  A  3  C  6  A  9  B  12  B  4  C  5  A  B  C  A  B  7  10  11  C  13  A A  A A A  A   308  SORTING  5.4.4  P1. Distribute initial runs onto Tape A until the input is exhausted. Let S be  the total number of initial runs.  P2. Carry out the construction above, using a minimum-path-length  T − 1 - ary tree with S external nodes, obtaining a T-lifo tree whose external path length is within S of the lower bound in  9 .  P3. Merge the runs according to this pattern. This scheme will produce its output on any desired tape. But it has one serious flaw — does the reader see what will go wrong? The problem is that the merge pattern requires some of the runs initially on tape A to be ascending, and some to be descending, depending on whether the corresponding external node appears on an odd or an even level. This problem can be resolved without knowing S in advance, by copying runs that should be descending onto an auxiliary tape or tapes, just before they are needed. Then the total amount of processing, in terms of initial run lengths, comes to  S logT−1 S + O S .   13  Thus the preorder merge is definitely better than polyphase or cascade, as S → ∞; indeed, it is asymptotically optimum, since  9  shows that S logT−1 S + O S  is the best we could ever hope to achieve on T tapes. On the other hand, for the comparatively small values of S that usually arise in practice, the preorder merge is rather inefficient; polyphase or cascade methods are simpler and faster, when S is reasonably small. Perhaps it will be possible to invent a simple distribution-and-merge scheme that is competitive with polyphase and cascade for small S, and that is asymptotically optimum for large S.  The second set of exercises below shows how Karp has formulated the question of read-forward merging in a similar way. The theory turns out to be rather more complicated in this case, although some very interesting results have been discovered.  EXERCISES — First Set 1. [17] It is often convenient, during read-forward merging, to mark the end of each run on tape by including an artificial sentinel record whose key is +∞. How should this practice be modified, when reading backwards? 2.

[M39] Karp’s preorder construction in the text yields trees with one-way merges at several terminal nodes. Prove that when T = 3 it is possible to construct asymptotically optimal 3-lifo trees in which two-way merging is used throughout. In other words, let ˆKT  n  be the minimum external path length over all T -lifo trees with n external nodes, such that every internal node has degree T −1. Prove that ˆK3 n  = n lg n + O n . 16. [M46] In the notation of exercise 15, is ˆKT  n  = n logT−1 n + O n  for all T ≥ 3, when n ≡ 1  modulo T − 2 ?   310  SORTING   cid:120  17. [28]  Richard D. Pratt.  To achieve ascending order in a read-backward cascade  merge, we could insist on an even number of merging passes; this suggests a technique of initial distribution that is somewhat different from Algorithm 5.4.3C. a  Change 5.4.3– 1  so that it shows only the perfect distributions that require an  5.4.4  even number of merging passes.  b  Design an initial distribution scheme that interpolates between these perfect dis- tributions.  Thus, if the number of initial runs falls between perfect distributions, it is desirable to merge some, but not all, of the runs twice, in order to reach a perfect distribution.    cid:120  18. [M38] Suppose that T tape units are available, for some T ≥ 3, and that T1  contains N records while the remaining tapes are empty. Is it possible to reverse the order of the records on T1 in fewer than Ω N log N  steps, without reading backwards?  The operation is, of course, trivial if backwards reading is allowed.  See exercise 5.2.5–14 for a class of such algorithms that do require order N log N steps.  EXERCISES — Second Set The following exercises develop the theory of tape merging on read-forward tapes; in this case each tape acts as a queue instead of as a stack. A merge pattern can be represented as a sequence of vectors y m  . . . y 1  y 0  exactly as in the text, but when we convert the vector representation to a tree representation we change “last formed, first grown on” to “first formed, first grown on.” Thus the invalid configurations  4  would be changed to  both  and  or  both  and  .   4′   A tree that can be labeled so as to represent a read-forward merge on T tapes is called T -fifo, analogous to the term “T -lifo” in the read-backward case.  When tapes can be read backwards, they make very good stacks. But unfortu- nately they don’t make very good general-purpose queues. If we randomly write and read, in a first-in-first-out manner, we waste a lot of time moving from one part of the tape to another. Even worse, we will soon run off the end of the tape! We run into the same problem as the queue overrunning memory in 2.2.2– 4  and  5 , but the solution in 2.2.2– 6  and  7  doesn’t apply to tapes since they aren’t circular loops. Therefore we shall call a tree strongly T -fifo if it can be labeled so that the corresponding merge pattern makes each tape follow the special queue discipline “write, rewind, read all, rewind; write, rewind, read all, rewind; etc.”   cid:120  19.

Let us say that a segment y q  . . . y r  of a merge pattern is a stage if no output tape is subsequently used as an input tape — that is, if there do not exist i, j, k with q ≥ i > k ≥ r, y j = −1, and y  k  j = +1. The purpose of this exercise is to prove that cascade merge minimizes the number of stages, over all merge patterns having the same number of tapes and initial runs. It is convenient to define some notation. Let us write v → w if v and w are T - vectors such that w reduces to v in the first stage of some merge pattern.  Thus there is a merge pattern y m  . . . y 0  such that y m  . . . y l+1  is a stage, w = y m  +··· + y 0 , and v = y l  + ··· + y 0 .  Let us write v ⪯ w if v and w are T -vectors such that the sum of the largest k elements of v is ≤ the sum of the largest k elements of w, for 1 ≤ k ≤ T. Thus, for example,  2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1  ⪯  1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 1 , since 2 ≤ 3, 2+2 ≤ 3+3, . . . , 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 ≤ 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0.

Let us say that a segment y q  . . . y r  of a merge pattern is a phase if no tape is used both for input and for output — that is, if there do not exist i, j, k with q ≥ i ≥ r, q ≥ k ≥ r, yȷ  k  = −1. The purpose of this exercise is to investigate merge patterns that minimize the number of phases. We shall write v ⇒ w if w can be reduced to v in one phase  a similar notation was introduced in exercise 23 ; and we let   i  = +1, and yȷ  Dk v  =  sk+tk+1, sk+tk+2, . . . , sk+tT , 0, . . . , 0 , where tj denotes the jth largest element of v and sk = t1 + ··· + tk. a  Prove that v ⇒ Dk v  for 1 ≤ k < T. b  Prove that v ⪯ w implies Dk v  ⪯ Dk w , for 1 ≤ k < T. c  Prove that v ⇒ w implies w ⪯ Dk v , for some k, 1 ≤ k < T. d  Consequently, a merge pattern that sorts the maximum number of initial runs on T tapes in q phases can be represented by a sequence of integers k1 k2 . . . kq, such that the initial distribution is Dkq . . .  Dk2 Dk1 u    . . .  , where u =  1, 0, . . . , 0 . This minimum-phase strategy has a strongly T -fifo representation, and it also belongs to the class of patterns in exercise 22. When T = 3 it is the polyphase merge, and for T = 4, 5, 6, 7 it is a variation of the balanced merge.  26. [M46]  R. M. Karp.

The Oscillating Sort A somewhat different approach to merge sorting was introduced by Sheldon Sobel in JACM 9  1962 , 372–375. Instead of starting with a distribution pass where all the initial runs are dispersed to tapes, he proposed an algorithm that oscillates back and forth between distribution and merging, so that much of the sorting takes place before the input has been completely examined.   312  SORTING  5.4.5  Suppose, for example, that there are five tapes available for merging. Sobel’s  method would sort 16 initial runs as follows:  D4  D4  D4  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4 —  D4 —  D4 —  T5 — D4  T1 A1 — — D4  T2 A1 — A1 — — D4  T3 A1 — A1 — A1 — — D4 —  T4 A1 — A1 — A1 — A1 — A16  Operation Distribute Merge Distribute Merge Distribute Merge Distribute Merge Merge  Cost 4 Phase 1 4 Phase 2 4 Phase 3 4 Phase 4 4 Phase 5 4 Phase 6 4 Phase 7 4 Phase 8 Phase 9 16 Here, as in Section 5.4.4, we use Ar and Dr to stand respectively for ascending and descending runs of relative length r. The method begins by writing an initial run onto each of four tapes, and merges them  reading backwards  onto the fifth tape. Distribution resumes again, this time cyclically shifted one place to the right with respect to the tapes, and a second merge produces another run D4. When four D4’s have been formed in this way, an additional merge creates A16. We could go on to create three more A16’s, merging them into a D64, and so on until the input is exhausted. It isn’t necessary to know the length of the input in advance.  When the number of initial runs, S, is 4m, it is not difficult to see that this method processes each record exactly m + 1 times: once during the distribution, and m times during a merge. When S is between 4m−1 and 4m, we could assume that dummy runs are present, bringing S up to 4m; hence the total sorting time  would essentially amount to log4 S + 1 passes over all the data. This is just  what would be achieved by a balanced sort on eight tapes; in general, oscillating sort with T work tapes is equivalent to balanced merging with 2 T −1  tapes, since it makes  passes over the data. When S is a power of T − 1, this is the best any T-tape method could possibly do, since it achieves the lower bound in Eq. 5.4.4– 9 . On the other hand, when S is  logT−1 S + 1   T − 1 m−1 + 1,  just one higher than a power of T − 1, the method wastes nearly a whole pass. Exercise 2 shows how to eliminate part of this penalty for non-perfect- powers S, by using a special ending routine. A further refinement was discovered in 1966 by Dennis L. Bencher, who called his procedure the “criss-cross merge” [see H. Wedekind, Datenorganisation  Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1970 , 164–166; see also U.S. Patent 3540000  1970 ]. The main idea is to delay merging until more knowledge of S has been gained. We shall discuss a slightly modified form of Bencher’s original scheme.   5.4.5  THE OSCILLATING SORT  313  This improved oscillating sort proceeds as follows:  Cost  T5 A1  T4 A1  T3 A1  T1 — — D4  T2 A1 A1 — — D4  Operation Distribute Distribute Merge Distribute Merge Distribute Merge Distribute Merge  4  A1  A1  A1  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  D4  16  —  —  A16  A1A1  A1A1  A1A1  A1A1  A1A1  A1A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4A1  D4D4  D4D4  D4D4  D4D4  D4D4  A1 A1 —  A1 A1 — — D4  A1 A1 — — D4  Phase 1 4 Phase 2 3 Phase 3 4 Phase 4 3 Phase 5 4 Phase 6 3 Phase 7 4 Phase 8 3 Phase 9 4 We do not merge the D4’s into an A16 at this point  unless the input happens to be exhausted ; only after building up to Phase 15 Merge will we get Phase 16 Merge The second A16 will occur after three more D4’s have been made, Phase 22 Merge Phase 23 Merge and so on  compare with Phases 1–5 . The advantage of Bencher’s scheme can be seen for example if there are only five initial runs: Oscillating sort as modified in exercise 2 would do a four-way merge  in Phase 2  followed by a two-way merge, for a total cost of 4 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 14, while Bencher’s scheme would do a two-way merge  in Phase 3  followed by a four-way merge, for a total cost of 4 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 12. Both methods also involve a small additional cost, namely one unit of rewind before the final merge.  A precise description of Bencher’s method appears in Algorithm B below. Unfortunately it seems to be a procedure that is harder to understand than to code; it is much easier to explain the technique to a computer than to a computer scientist! This is partly because it is an inherently recursive method that has been expressed in iterative form and then optimized somewhat; the reader may find it necessary to trace through the operation of this algorithm several times before discovering what is really going on. Algorithm B  Oscillating sort with “criss-cross” distribution . This algorithm takes initial runs and disperses them to tapes, occasionally interrupting the distribution process in order to merge some of the tape contents. The algorithm uses P-way merging, assuming that T = P + 1 ≥ 3 tape units are available — not counting the unit that may be necessary to hold the input data. The tape units must allow reading in both forward and backward directions, and they are designated by the numbers 0, 1, . . . , P. The following tables are maintained:  — A16  A16D4  D4 —  4 16  A16  D4  D4   SORTING  314 5.4.5 D[j], 0 ≤ j ≤ P: Number of dummy runs assumed to be present at the end of  A[l, j], 0 ≤ l ≤ L, 0 ≤ j ≤ P  tape j. Here L is a number such that at most P L+1 initial runs will be input. When A[l, j] = k ≥ 0, a run of nominal length P k is present on tape j, corresponding to “level l” of the algorithm’s operation. This run is ascending if k is even, descending if k is odd. When A[l, j] < 0, level l does not use tape j.  The statement “Write an initial run on tape j” is an abbreviation for the following operations:  Set A[l, j] ← 0. If the input is exhausted, increase D[j] by 1; otherwise write an initial run  in ascending order  onto tape j.  The statement “Merge to tape j” is an abbreviation for the following operations: If D[i] > 0 for all i ̸= j, decrease D[i] by 1 for all i ̸= j and increase D[j] by 1. Otherwise merge one run to tape j, from all tapes i ̸= j such that D[i] = 0, and decrease D[i] by 1 for all other i ̸= j.  Fig. 77. Oscillating sort, with a “criss-cross” distribution.  B1. [Initialize.] Set D[j] ← 0 for 0 ≤ j ≤ P. Set A[0, 0] ← −1, l ← 0, q ← 0.  Then write an initial run on tape j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ P.  B2. [Input complete?]  At this point tape q is empty and the other tapes contain at most one run each.  If there is more input, go on to step B3. But if the input is exhausted, rewind all tapes j ̸= q such that A[0, j] is even; then merge to tape q, reading forwards on tapes just rewound, and reading backwards on the other tapes. This completes the sort, with the output in ascending order on tape q.  B3. [Begin new level.] Set l ← l + 1, r ← q, s ← 0, and q ←  q + 1  mod T. Write an initial run on tape  q + j  mod T, for 1 ≤ j ≤ T − 2.  Thus an initial run is written onto each tape except tapes q and r.  Set A[l, q] ← −1 and A[l, r] ← −2.  B4. [Ready to merge?] If A[l−1, q] ̸= s, go back to step B3.  B1. Initialize  Yes  B2. Input complete?  No  B3. Begin new level  B4. Ready to merge?  Yes  B5. Merge  No  Yes  No  B6.

See the definition of this operation above.  Then set s ← s + 1, l ← l − 1, A[l, r] ← s, and A[l, q] ← −1. Set r ←  2q − r  mod T.  In general, we have r =  q − 1  mod T when s is even, r =  q + 1  mod T when s is odd.   B6. [Is level complete?] If l = 0, go to B2. Otherwise if A[l, j] = s for all j ̸= q  = A[l0,  q0−1  mod T ]; and assume furthermore that either s+ = 0 or s−  and j ̸= r, go to B4. Otherwise return to B3. We can use a “recursion induction” style of proof to show that this al- gorithm is valid, just as we have done for Algorithm 2.3.1T. Suppose that we begin at step B3 with l = l0, q = q0, s+ = A[l0,  q0+1  mod T ], and = 1 s− = 3 or ··· . It is possible to verify by induction that the algorithm or s+ = 2 or s− will eventually get to step B5 without changing rows 0 through l0 of A, and with l = l0 + 1, q = q0 ± 1, r = q0, and s = s+ or s− , where we choose the + sign if ̸= 1, 3  or ··· , and we choose ̸= 1  or  s+ = 4 and s− s+ = 0 or  s+ = 2 and s− = 3 and s+ ̸= 0, 2  or ··· . The proof the − sign if  s− sketched here is not very elegant, but the algorithm has been stated in a form more suited to implementation than to verification.  = 1 and s+ ̸= 0  or  s−  Figure 78 shows the efficiency of Algorithm B, in terms of the average num- ber of times each record is merged as a function of the number S of initial runs, assuming that the initial runs are approximately equal in length.  Corresponding graphs for polyphase and cascade sort have appeared in Figs. 70 and 74.  A slight improvement, mentioned in exercise 3, has been used in preparing this chart.  A related method called the gyrating sort was developed by R. M. Karp, based on the theory of preorder merging that we have discussed in Section 5.4.4; see Combinatorial Algorithms, edited by Randall Rustin  Algorithmics Press, 1972 , 21–29. Reading forwards. The oscillating sort pattern appears to require a read- backwards capability, since we need to store long runs somewhere as we merge newly input short runs. However, M. A. Goetz [Proc. AFIPS Spring Joint Comp. Conf. 25  1964 , 599–607] has discovered a way to perform an oscillating sort using only forward reading and simple rewinding. His method is radically different from the other schemes we have seen in this chapter, in two ways: a  Data is sometimes written at the front of the tape, with the understanding  that the existing data in the middle of the tape is not destroyed.  b  All initial runs have a fixed maximum length. Condition  a  violates the first-in-first-out property we have assumed to be characteristic of forward reading, but it can be implemented reliably if a sufficient amount of blank tape is left between runs and if parity errors are ignored at appropriate times. Condition  b  tends to be somewhat incompatible with an efficient use of replacement selection.  Goetz’s read-forward oscillating sort has the somewhat dubious distinction of being one of the first algorithms to be patented as an algorithm instead of as   316  SORTING  5.4.5  a physical device [U.S. Patent 3380029  1968 ]; between 1968 and 1988, no one in the U.S.A. could legally use the algorithm in a program without permission of the patentee. Bencher’s read-backward oscillating sort technique was patented by IBM several years later. [Alas, we have reached the end of the era when the joy of discovering a new algorithm was satisfaction enough! Fortunately the oscillating sort isn’t especially good; let’s hope that community-minded folks who invent the best algorithms continue to make their ideas freely available. Of course the specter of people keeping new techniques completely secret is far worse than the public appearance of algorithms that are proprietary for a limited time.]  The central idea in Goetz’s method is to arrange things so that each tape begins with a run of relative length 1, followed by one of relative length P, then P 2, etc. For example, when T = 5 the sort begins as follows, using “.” to indicate the current position of the read-write head on each tape:  “Cost”  Remarks  Operation T1 T2 T4 T3 T5 [T5 not rewound] 5 Phase 1 Distribute .A1 .A1 .A1 .A1 A1.

During Phase 1, T1 was rewinding while T2 was receiving its input, then T2 was rewinding while T3 was receiving input, etc. Eventually, when the input is exhausted, dummy runs will start to appear, and we will sometimes need to imagine that they were written explicitly on the tape at full length. For example, if S = 18, the A1’s on T4 and T5 would be dummies during Phase 9; we would have to skip forwards on T4 and T5 while merging from T2 and T3 to T1 during Phase 10, because we have to get to the A4’s on T4 and T5 in preparation for Phase 11. On the other hand, the dummy A1 on T1 need not appear explicitly. Thus the “endgame” is a bit tricky.  Another example of this method appears in the next section.  EXERCISES 1. [22] The text illustrates Sobel’s original oscillating sort for T = 5 and S = 16. Give a precise specification of an algorithm that generalizes the procedure, sorting S = P L initial runs on T = P + 1 ≥ 3 tapes. Strive for simplicity. 2. [24] If S = 6 in Sobel’s original method, we could pretend that S = 16 and that 10 dummy runs were present. Then Phase 3 in the text’s example would put dummy runs A0 on T4 and T5; Phase 4 would merge the A1’s on T2 and T3 into a D2 on T1; Phases 5–8 would do nothing; and Phase 9 would produce A6 on T4. It would be better   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  317  Fig. 78.

Practical Considerations for Tape Merging Now comes the nitty-gritty: We have discussed the various families of merge patterns, so it is time to see how they actually apply to real configurations of computers and magnetic tapes, and to compare them in a meaningful way. Our study of internal sorting showed that we can’t adequately judge the efficiency of a sorting method merely by counting the number of comparisons it performs; sim- ilarly we can’t properly evaluate an external sorting method by simply knowing the number of passes it makes over the data.  g n i g r e m e l i  h w ” s e s s a p “  f o  r e b m u N  14  13  12  11  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  T = 3  T = 4  T = 5  T = 6  T = 8  T = 10  1  2  5  10  20  50  100  200  500  1000 2000  5000  Initial runs, S   318  SORTING  5.4.6  In this section we shall discuss the characteristics of typical tape units, and the way they affect initial distribution and merging. In particular we shall study some schemes for buffer allocation, and the corresponding effects on running time. We also shall consider briefly the construction of sort generator programs. How tape works. Different manufacturers have provided tape units with widely varying characteristics. For convenience, we shall define a hypothetical MIXT tape unit, which is reasonably typical of the equipment that was being manufactured at the time this book was first written. MIXT reads and writes 800 characters per inch of tape, at a rate of 75 inches per second. This means that one character is read or written every 1 3 microseconds, when the tape is active. Actual tape units that were available in 1970 had densities ranging from 200 to 1600 characters per inch, and tape speeds ranging from 37 1 2 to 150 inches per second, so their effective speed varied from 1 8 to 4 times as fast as MIXT.  60 ms, or 16 2  Of course, we observed near the beginning of Section 5.4 that magnetic tapes in general are now pretty much obsolete. But many lessons were learned during the decades when tape sorting was of major importance, and those lessons are still valuable. Thus our main concern here is not to obtain particular answers; it is to learn how to combine theory and practice in a reasonable way. Methodology is much more important than phenomenology, because the principles of problem solving remain useful despite technological changes. Readers will benefit most from this material by transplanting themselves temporarily into the mindset of the 1970s. Let us therefore pretend that we still live in that bygone era.  One of the important considerations to keep in mind, as we adopt the perspective of the early days, is the fact that individual tapes have a strictly limited capacity. Each reel contains 2400 feet of tape or less; hence there is room for at most 23,000,000 or so characters per reel of MIXT tape, and it takes about 23000000 3600000 ≈ 6.4 minutes to read them all. If larger files must be sorted, it is generally best to sort one reelful at a time, and then to merge the individually sorted reels, in order to avoid excessive tape handling. This means that the number of initial runs, S, actually present in the merge patterns we have been studying is never extremely large. We will never find S > 5000, even with a very small internal memory that produces initial runs only 5000 characters long. Consequently the formulas that give asymptotic efficiency of the algorithms as S → ∞ are primarily of academic interest.  Data appears on tape in blocks  Fig. 79 , and each read write instruction transmits a single block. Tape blocks are often called “records,” but we shall avoid that terminology because it conflicts with the fact that we are sorting a file of “records” in another sense. Such a distinction was unnecessary on many of the early sorting programs written during the 1950s, since one record was written per block; but we shall see that it is usually advantageous to have quite a few records in every block on the tape.  An interblock gap, 480 character positions long, appears between adjacent blocks, in order to allow the tape to stop and to start between individual read or write commands. The effect of interblock gaps is to decrease the number of   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  319  Fig. 79. Magnetic tape with variable-size blocks.  characters per reel of tape, depending on the number of characters per block  see Fig. 80 ; and the average number of characters transmitted per second decreases in the same way, since tape moves at a fairly constant speed.  Fig. 80. The number of characters per reel of MIXT tape, as a function of the block size.  Many old-fashioned computers had fixed block sizes that were rather small; their design was reflected in the MIX computer as defined in Chapter 1, which always reads and writes 100-word blocks. But MIX’s convention corresponds to about 500 characters per block, and 480 characters per gap, hence almost half the tape is wasted! Most machines of the 1970s therefore allowed the block size to be variable; we shall discuss the choice of appropriate block sizes below.  At the end of a read or write operation, the tape unit “coasts” at full speed over the first 66 characters  or so  of the gap. If the next operation for the same tape is initiated during this time, the tape motion continues without interruption. But if the next operation doesn’t come soon enough, the tape will stop and it will also require some time to accelerate to full speed on the next operation. The combined stop start time delay is 5 ms, 2 for the stop and 3 for the start  see Fig. 81 . Thus if we just miss the chance to have continuous full-speed reading, the effect on running time is essentially the same as if there were 780 characters instead of 480 in the interblock gap.  Now let us consider the operation of rewinding. Unfortunately, the exact time needed to rewind over a given number n of characters is not easy to characterize. On some machines there is a high-speed rewind that applies only when n is greater than 5 million or so; for smaller values of n, rewinding goes at  Load Point  Interblock Gaps  Block 1  Block 2  Block 3  Block 4  20,000,000  10,000,000  e p a t  r e p  s r e t c a r a h C  0  0  1000  2000  3000  4000  5000  Characters per block   320  SORTING  5.4.6  Fig. 81.

On other machines a special motor is used to control all of the rewind operations; it gradually accelerates the tape reel to a certain number of revolutions per minute, then puts on the brakes when it is time to stop, and the actual tape speed varies with the fullness of the reel. For simplicity, we shall assume that MIXT requires max 30, n 150  ms to rewind over n character positions  including gaps , roughly two-fifths as long as it took to write them. This is a reasonably good approximation to the behavior of many actual tape units, where the ratio of read write time to rewind time is generally between 2 and 3, but it does not adequately model the effect of combined low-speed and high-speed rewind that is present on many other machines.  See Fig. 82.   Initial loading and or rewinding will position a tape at “load point,” and an extra 110 ms are necessary for any read or write operation initiated at load point. When the tape is not at load point, it may be read backwards; an extra 32 ms is added to the time of any backward operation following a forward operation or any forward operation following a backward one.

Let us now look again at the process of P-way merging, with an emphasis on input and output activities, assuming that P +1 tape units are being used for the input files and the output file. Our goal is to overlap the input output operations as much as possible with each other and with the computations of the program, so that the overall merging time is minimized.  It is instructive to consider the following special case,  in which serious  restrictions are placed on the amount of simultaneity possible. Suppose that a  at most one tape may be written on at any one time; b  at most one tape may be read from at any one time; c  reading, writing, and computing may take place simultaneously only when  the read and write operations have been initiated simultaneously.  It turns out that a system of 2P input buffers and 2 output buffers is sufficient to keep the tape moving at essentially its maximum speed, even though these three restrictions are imposed, unless the computer is unusually slow. Note that condition  a  is not really a restriction, since there is only one output tape. Furthermore the amount of input is equal to the amount of output, so there is only one tape being read, on the average, at any given time; if condition  b  is not satisfied, there will necessarily be periods when no input at all is occurring. Thus we can minimize the merging time if we keep the output tape busy.  An important technique called forecasting leads to the desired effect. While we are doing a P-way merge, we generally have P current input buffers, which are being used as the source of data; some of them are more full than others, depending on how much of their data has already been scanned. If all of them become empty at about the same time, we will need to do a lot of reading before we can proceed further, unless we have foreseen this eventuality in advance. Fortunately it is always possible to tell which buffer will empty first, by simply looking at the last record in each buffer. The buffer whose last record has the smallest key will always be the first one empty, regardless of the values of any other keys; so we always know which file should be the source of our next input command. The following algorithm spells out this principle in detail. Algorithm F  Forecasting with floating buffers . This algorithm controls the buffering during a P-way merge of long input files, for P ≥ 2. Assume that the input tapes and files are numbered 1, 2, . . . , P. The algorithm uses 2P input buffers I[1], . . . , I[2P ]; two output buffers O[0] and O[1]; and the following auxiliary tables: A[j], 1≤ j ≤ 2P: 0 if I[j] is available for input, 1 otherwise. B[i], 1≤ i≤ P: C[i], 1≤ i≤ P: L[i], 1≤ i≤ P: The last key read so far from file i. S[j], 1≤ j ≤ 2P: Index of the buffer to use when I[j] becomes empty. The algorithm described here does not terminate; an appropriate way to shut it off is discussed below.  Index of the buffer holding the last block read so far from file i. Index of the buffer currently being used for the input from file i.   322  SORTING  5.4.6  Fig. 83. Forecasting with floating buffers.  F1. [Initialize.] Read the first block from tape i into buffer I[i], set A[i] ← 1, A[P + i] ← 0, B[i] ← i, C[i] ← i, and set L[i] to the key of the final record in buffer I[i], for 1 ≤ i ≤ P. Then find m such that L[m] = min{L[1], . . . , L[P ]}; and set t ← 0, k ← P + 1. Begin to read from tape m into buffer I[k].  F2. [Merge.] Merge records from buffers I[C[1]], . . . , I[C[P ]] to O[t], until O[t] is full. If during this process an input buffer, say I[C[i]], becomes empty and O[t] is not yet full, set A[C[i]] ← 0, C[i] ← S[C[i]], and continue to merge.  F3. [I O complete.] Wait until the previous read  or read write  operation is complete. Then set A[k] ← 1, S[B[m]] ← k, B[m] ← k, and set L[m] to the key of the final record in I[k].  F4. [Forecast.] Find m such that L[m] = min{L[1], . . . , L[P ]}, and find k such  that A[k] = 0.  F5. [Read write.] Begin to read from tape m into buffer I[k], and to write from  buffer O[t] onto the output tape. Then set t ← 1 − t and return to F2. The example in Fig. 84 shows how forecasting works when P = 2, assuming that each block on tape contains only two records. The input buffer contents are illustrated each time we get to the beginning of step F2. Algorithm F essentially forms P queues of buffers, with C[i] pointing to the front and B[i] to the rear of the ith queue, and with S[j] pointing to the successor of buffer I[j]; these pointers are shown as arrows in Fig. 84. Line 1 illustrates the state of affairs after initialization: There is one buffer for each input file, and another block is being read from File 1  since 03 < 05 . Line 2 shows the status of things after the first block has been merged: We are outputting a block containing 01 02 , and inputting the next block from File 2  since 05 < 09 . Note that in line 3, three of the four input buffers are essentially committed to File 2, since we are reading from that file and we already have a full buffer and a partly full buffer in its  F4.

This floating-buffer arrangement is an important feature of Algorithm F, since we would be unable to proceed in line 4 if we had chosen File 1 instead of File 2 for the input on line 3.  In order to prove that Algorithm F is valid, we must show two things:  i  There is always an input buffer available  that is, we can always find a k in  step F4 .  ii  If an input buffer is exhausted while merging, its successor is already present  in memory  that is, S[C[i]] is meaningful in step F2 .  Suppose  i  is false, so that all buffers are unavailable at some point when we reach step F4. Each time we get to that step, the total amount of unprocessed data among all the buffers is exactly P bufferloads, just enough data to fill P buffers if it were redistributed, since we are inputting and outputting data at the same rate. Some of the buffers are only partially full; but at most one buffer for each file is partially full, so at most P buffers are in that condition. By hypothesis all 2P of the buffers are unavailable; therefore at least P of them must be completely full. This can happen only if P are full and P are empty, otherwise we would have too much data. But at most one buffer can be unavailable and empty at any one time; hence  i  cannot be false.  Suppose  ii  is false, so that we have no unprocessed records in memory, for some file, but the current output buffer is not yet full. By the principle of forecasting, we must have no more than one block of data for each of the other files, since we do not read in a block for a file unless that block will be needed before the buffers on any other file are exhausted. Therefore the total number of unprocessed records amounts to at most P −1 blocks; adding the unfilled output buffer leads to less than P bufferloads of data in memory, a contradiction.  File 1 contains 01 03  04 09  11 13  16 18  File 2 contains 02 05  06 07  08 10  12 14  · · · · · ·  Line No.  Buﬀers for File 1  Buﬀers for File 2  Next input being  read from  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  01 03  02 05  04 09  03  09  09  09  11 13  11 13  13  16 18  05  05  07  10  14  06 07  08 10  12 14  File 1  File 2  File 2  File 1  File 2  File 1  File 2   324  SORTING  5.4.6  This argument establishes the validity of Algorithm F; and it also indicates the possibility of pathological circumstances under which the algorithm just barely avoids disaster. An important subtlety that we have not mentioned, regarding the possibility of equal keys, is discussed in exercise 5. See also exercise 4, which considers the case P = 1. One way to terminate Algorithm F gracefully is to set L[m] to ∞ in step F3 if the block just read is the last of a run.  It is customary to indicate the end of a run in some special way.  After all of the data on all of the files has been read, we will eventually find all of the L’s equal to ∞ in step F4; then it is usually possible to begin reading the first blocks of the next run on each file, beginning initialization of the next merge phase as the final P + 1 blocks are output.  Thus we can keep the output tape going at essentially full speed, without reading more than one tape at a time. An exception to this rule occurs in step F1, where it would be beneficial to read several tapes at once in order to get things going in the beginning; but step F1 can usually be arranged to overlap with the preceding part of the computation.  The idea of looking at the last record in each block, to predict which buffer will empty first, was discovered in 1953 by F. E. Holberton. The technique was first published by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 144–145, 165]. His rather complicated algorithm used 3P input buffers, with three dedicated to each input file; Algorithm F improves the situation by making use of floating buffers, allowing any single file to claim as many as P + 1 input buffers at once, yet never needing more than 2P in all. A discussion of merging with fewer than 2P input buffers appears at the end of this section. Some interesting improvements to Algorithm F are discussed in Section 5.4.9. Comparative behavior of merge patterns. Let us now use what we know about tapes and merging to compare the effectiveness of the various merge patterns that we have studied in Sections 5.4.2 through 5.4.5. It is very in- structive to work out the details when each method is applied to the same task. Consider therefore the problem of sorting a file whose records each contain 100 characters, when there are 100,000 character positions of memory available for data storage — not counting the space needed for the program and its auxiliary variables, or the space occupied by links in a selection tree.  Remember that we are pretending to live in the days when memories were small.  The input appears in random order on tape, in blocks of 5000 characters each, and the output is to appear in the same format. There are five scratch tapes to work with, in addition to the unit containing the input tape.  The total number of records to be sorted is 100,000, but this information is  not known in advance to the sorting algorithm.  The foldout illustration in Chart A summarizes the actions that transpire when ten different merging schemes are applied to this data. The best way to look at this important illustration is to imagine that you are actually watching the sort take place: Scan each line slowly from left to right, pretending that you can actually see six tapes reading, writing, rewinding, and or reading backwards, as   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  325   This page left blank on purpose   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  325  indicated on the diagram. During a P-way merge the input tapes will be moving only 1 P times as often as the output tape. When the original input tape has been completely read  and rewound “with lock” , Chart A assumes that a skilled computer operator dismounts it and replaces it with a scratch tape, in just 30 seconds. In examples 2, 3, and 4 this is “critical path time” when the computer is idly waiting for the operator to finish; but in the remaining examples, the dismount-reload operation is overlapped by other processing. Example 1. Read-forward balanced merge. Let’s review the specifications of the problem: The records are 100 characters long, there is enough internal memory to hold 1000 records at a time, and each block on the input tape contains 5000 characters  50 records . There are 100,000 records  = 10,000,000 characters = 2000 blocks  in all.  We are free to choose the block size for intermediate files. A six-tape balanced merge uses three-way merging, so the technique of Algorithm F calls for 8 buffers; we may therefore use blocks containing 1000 8 = 125 records  = 12500 characters  each.  The initial distribution pass can make use of replacement selection  Algo- rithm 5.4.1R , and in order to keep the tapes running smoothly we may use two input buffers of 50 records each, plus two output buffers of 125 records each. This leaves room for 650 records in the replacement selection tree. Most of the initial runs will therefore be about 1300 records long  10 or 11 blocks ; it turns out that 78 initial runs are produced in Chart A, the last one being rather short. The first merge pass indicated shows nine runs merged to tape 4, instead of alternating between tapes 4, 5, and 6. This makes it possible to do useful work while the computer operator is loading a scratch tape onto unit 6; since the total number S of runs is known once the initial distribution has been completed, the algorithm knows that ⌈S 9⌉ runs should be merged to tape 4, then ⌈ S − 3  9⌉ to tape 5, then ⌈ S − 6  9⌉ to tape 6.  The entire sorting procedure for this example can be summarized in the  following way, using the notation introduced in Section 5.4.2: — 38 — 241 —  126 — 9261 — —  126 — 93 — 781  — 39 — 271 —  — 39 — 271 —  126 — 93 — —  Example 2. Read-forward polyphase merge. The second example in Chart A carries out the polyphase merge, according to Algorithm 5.4.2D. In this case we do five-way merging, so the memory is split into 12 buffers of 83 records each. During the initial replacement selection we have two 50-record input buffers and two 83-record output buffers, leaving 734 records in the tree; so the initial runs this time are about 1468 records long  17 or 18 blocks . The situation illustrated shows that S = 70 initial runs were obtained, the last two   326  SORTING  5.4.6  actually being only four blocks and one block long, respectively. The merge pattern can be summarized thus:  013118 115 17 13 11 — 701  013117 114 16 12 — 341 —  013115 112 14 —  161191  191 —  012112  18 — 84 82 81 —  0818 — 48 44 42 41 —  —  08142153 142153 2153 52 51 —  Curiously, polyphase actually took about 25 seconds longer than the far less  sophisticated balanced merge! There are two main reasons for this:  1  Balanced merge was particularly lucky in this case, since S = 78 is just less than a perfect power of 3. If 82 initial runs had been produced, the balanced merge would have needed an extra pass.  2  Polyphase merge wasted 30 seconds while the input tape was being changed, and a total of more than 5 minutes went by while it was waiting for rewind operations to be completed. By contrast the balanced merge needed comparatively little rewind time. In the second phase of the polyphase merge, 13 seconds were saved because the 8 dummy runs on tape 6 could be assumed present even while that tape was rewinding; but no other rewind overlap oc- curred. Therefore polyphase lost out even though it required significantly less read write time.  Example 3. Read-forward cascade merge. This case is analogous to the preceding, but using Algorithm 5.4.3C. The merging may be summarized thus:  114 15 5163 — 701  115 19 53 121 —  112 — 5362 61 —  114 114 — 181 —  115 115 11 181 —  —  132336  22 161 —   Remember to watch each of these examples in action, by scanning Chart A in the foldout illustration.   Example 4. Tape-splitting polyphase merge. This procedure, described at the end of Section 5.4.2, allows most of the rewind time to be overlapped. It uses four-way merging, so we divide the memory into ten 100-record buffers; there are 700 records in the replacement selection tree, so it turns out that 72 initial runs are formed. The last run, again, is very short. A distribution scheme analogous to Algorithm 5.4.2D has been used, followed by a simple but somewhat ad hoc   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  327  method of placing dummy runs:  121 02117 113 110 16 15 12 11 — — 181 181 —  119 02115 111 18 14 13 — — 131  131141 131141  141 —  115 02111 17 14 — — 3172  3172131 3172131 72131 71131 131 —  18 0214 — — 44 4431 4431 4331 4231 4131 31 — 721  — — 0244  02443241 02443241 01443241 423241 413241 3241 3141 41 — —  0219 021944 021944 1844 1444 1344 44 43 42 41 — 271 —  This turns out to give the best running time of all the examples in Chart A that do not read backwards. Since S will never be very large, it would be possible to develop a more complicated algorithm that places dummy runs in an even better way; see Eq. 5.4.2– 26 . Example 5. Cascade merge with rewind overlap. This procedure runs almost as fast as the previous example, although the algorithm governing it is much simpler. We simply use the cascade sort method as in Algorithm 5.4.3C for the initial distribution, but with T = 5 instead of T = 6. Then each phase of each “cascade” staggers the tapes so that we ordinarily don’t write on a tape until after it has had a chance to be rewound. The pattern, very briefly, is  Example 6. Read-backward balanced merge. This is like example 1 but with all the rewinding eliminated:  121 14 72 — 721  A26 1 — A3 9 — A1 78  122 17 — 261 —  A26 1 — A3 9 — —  119 — 83 — —  110 — 7282 81 —  —  122235  — 221 —  A26 1 — A2 9A1 6 — —  — D9 3 — D1 24 —  — D9 3 — D1 27 —  — 410 41 161 —  — D8 3 — D1 27 —   328  SORTING  5.4.6  Since there was comparatively little rewinding in example 1, this scheme is not a great deal better than the read-forward case. In fact, it turns out to be slightly slower than tape-splitting polyphase, in spite of the fortunate value S = 78. Example 7. Read-backward polyphase merge. In this example only five of the six tapes are used, in order to eliminate the time for rewinding and changing the input tape. Thus, the merging is only four-way, and the buffer allocation is like that in examples 4 and 5. A distribution like Algorithm 5.4.2D is used, but with alternating directions of runs, and with tape 1 fixed as the final output tape. First an ascending run is written on tape 1; then descending runs on tapes 2, 3, 4; then ascending runs on 2, 3, 4; then descending on 1, 2, 3; etc. Each time we switch direction, replacement selection usually produces a shorter run, so it turns out that 77 initial runs are formed instead of the 72 in examples 4 and 5. This procedure results in a distribution of  22, 21, 19, 15  runs, and the next perfect distribution is  29, 56, 52, 44 . Exercise 5.4.4–5 shows how to generate strings of merge numbers that can be used to place dummy runs in optimum positions; such a procedure is feasible in practice because the finiteness of a tape reel ensures that S is never too large. Therefore the example in Chart A has been constructed using such a method for dummy run placement  see exercise 7 . This turns out to be the fastest of all the examples illustrated. Example 8. Read-backward cascade merge. As in example 7, only five tapes are used here. This procedure follows Algorithm 5.4.3C, using rewind and forward read to avoid one-way merging  since rewinding is more than twice as fast as reading on MIXT units . Distribution is therefore the same as in example 5. The pattern may be summarized briefly as follows, using ↓ to denote rewinding:  A21 1 1↓ A4 A8A2 7 —  A72  A22 1 1↓ A7 A2 5  D17 —  A19 1 — A4 9 A9↓ —  D2  A10 1 1D2 2D5 3 —  D25 —  — D10 4 4↓ D1 D21 —  Example 9. Read-backward oscillating sort. Oscillating sort with T = 5  Algorithm 5.4.5B  can use buffer allocation as in examples 4, 5, 7, and 8, since it does four-way merging. However, replacement selection does not behave in the same way, since a run of length 700  not 1400 or so  is output just before entering each merge phase, in order to clear the internal memory. Consequently 85 runs are produced in this example, instead of 72. Some of the key steps in the process are —  A1A1  A1A1  A1A1  D4 . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  A1 .  .

In the final example, replace- ment selection is not used because all initial runs must be the same length. Therefore full core loads of 1000 records are sorted internally whenever an initial run is required; this makes S = 100.

Estimating the running time. Let’s see now how to figure out the ap- proximate execution time of a sorting method using MIXT tapes. Could we have predicted the outcomes shown in Chart A without carrying out a detailed simulation?  One way that has traditionally been used to compare different merge pat- terns is to superimpose graphs such as we have seen in Figs. 70, 74, and 78. These graphs show the effective number of passes over the data, as a function of the number of initial runs, assuming that each initial run has approximately the same length.  See Fig. 85.  But this is not a very realistic comparison, because we have seen that different methods lead to different numbers of initial runs; furthermore there is a different overhead time caused by the relative frequency of interblock gaps, and the rewind time also has significant effects. All of these machine-dependent features make it impossible to prepare charts that provide a valid machine-independent comparison of the methods. On the other hand, Fig. 85 does show us that, except for balanced merge, the effective number of passes can be reasonably well approximated by smooth curves of the form α ln S + β. Therefore we can make a fairly good comparison of the methods in any particular situation, by studying formulas that approximate the running time. Our goal, of course, is to find formulas that are simple yet sufficiently realistic.  Let us now attempt to develop such formulas, in terms of the following  parameters: N = number of records to be sorted, C = number of characters per record, M = number of character positions available in the internal memory  assumed to  be a multiple of C ,  g n i g r e m e l i  h w ” s e s s a p “  f o  r e b m u N  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  Balanced  T = 6  Cascade  T = 5  Polyphase  T = 5  Oscillating  T = 5   1  2  5  10  20  50  100  200  500 1000 2000  5000  Initial runs, S   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  331  τ = number of seconds to read or write one character, ρτ = number of seconds to rewind over one character, στ = number of seconds for stop start time delay, γ = number of characters per interblock gap, δ = number of seconds for operator to dismount and replace input tape, Bi = number of characters per block in the unsorted input, Bo = number of characters per block in the sorted output. For MIXT we have τ = 1 60000, ρ = 2 5, σ = 300, γ = 480. The example application treated above has N = 100000, C = 100, M = 100000, δ = 30, Bi = Bo = 5000. These parameters are usually the machine and data characteristics that affect sorting time most critically  although rewind time is often given by a more complicated expression than a simple ratio ρ . Given the parameters above and a merge pattern, we shall compute further quantities such as  P = maximum order of merge in the pattern, P ′ = number of records in replacement selection tree, S = number of initial runs,  π = α ln S + β = approximate average number of times each character is read and written, not counting the initial distribution or the final merge,  π′ = α′ ln S + β′ = approximate average number of times rewinding over each  character during intermediate merge phases,  B = number of characters per block in the intermediate merge  phases,  ωi, ω, ωo = “overhead ratio,” the effective time required to read or write a character  due to gaps and stop start  divided by the hard- ware time τ.  The examples of Chart A have chosen block and buffer sizes according to  the formula      B =  M  C 2P + 2   C,  so that the blocks can be as large as possible consistent with the buffering scheme of Algorithm F.  In order to avoid trouble during the final pass, P should be small enough that  1  makes B ≥ Bo.  The size of the tree during replacement selection is then  For random data the number of initial runs S can be estimated as  P ′ =  M − 2Bi − 2B  C.

Assuming that Bi < B and that the input tape can be run at full speed during the distribution  see below , it takes about N Cωiτ seconds to distribute the initial runs, where  ωi =  Bi + γ  Bi.   4  While merging, the buffering scheme allows simultaneous reading, writing, and computing, but the frequent switching between input tapes means that we must add the stop start time penalty; therefore we set ω =  B + γ + σ  B,   5   and the merge time is approximately   π + ρπ′ N Cωτ.   6  This formula penalizes rewind slightly, since ω includes stop start time, but other considerations, such as rewind interlock and the penalty for reading from load point, usually compensate for this. The final merge pass, assuming that Bo ≤ B, is constrained by the overhead ratio  ωo =  Bo + γ  Bo.   7   We may estimate the running time of the final merge and rewind as  N C 1 + ρ  ωoτ;  in practice it might take somewhat longer due to the presence of unequal block lengths  input and output are not synchronized as in Algorithm F , but the running time will be pretty much the same for all merge patterns.  Before going into more specific formulas for individual patterns, let us try  to justify two of the assumptions made above.  a  Can replacement selection keep up with the input tape? In the examples of Chart A it probably can, since it takes about ten iterations of the inner loop of Algorithm 5.4.1R to select the next record, and we have Cωiτ > 1667 microseconds in which to do this. With careful programming of the replacement selection loop, this can be done on most machines  even in the 1970s . Notice that the situation is somewhat less critical while merging: The computation time per record is almost always less than the tape time per record during a P-way merge, since P isn’t very large.  b  Should we really choose B to be the maximum possible buffer size, as in  1 ? A large buffer size cuts down the overhead ratio ω in  5 ; but it also increases the number of initial runs S, since P ′ is decreased. It is not immediately clear which factor is more important. Considering the merging time as a function of x = CP ′, we can express it in the approximate form    θ1 ln   N  x    + 7 6  + θ2   θ3 − x    θ4 − x   8   for some appropriate constants θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, with θ3 > θ4. Differentiating with respect to x shows that there is some N0 such that for all N ≥ N0 it does not pay   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  333  to increase x at the expense of buffer size. In the sorting application of Chart A, for example, N0 turns out to be roughly 10000; when sorting more than 10000 records the large buffer size is superior.  Note, however, that with balanced merge the number of passes jumps sharply when S passes a power of P. If an approximation to N is known in advance, the buffer size should be chosen so that S will most likely be slightly less than a power of P. For example, the buffer size for the first line of Chart A was 12500; since S = 78, this was very satisfactory, but if S had turned out to be 82 it would have been much better to decrease the buffer size a little. Formulas for the ten examples. Returning to Chart A, let us try to give formulas that approximate the running time in each of the ten methods. In most cases the basic formula  N Cωiτ +  π + ρπ′ N Cωτ +  1 + ρ N Cωoτ   9  will be a sufficiently good approximation to the overall sorting time, once we have specified the number of intermediate merge passes π = α ln S + β and the number of intermediate rewind passes π′ = α′ ln S+β′. Sometimes it is necessary to add a further correction to  9 ; details for each method can be worked out as follows: Example 1. Read-forward balanced merge. The formulas  π = ⌈ln S ln P⌉ − 1,  π′ = ⌈ln S ln P⌉ P  may be used for P-way merging on 2P tapes. Example 2. Read-forward polyphase merge. We may take π′ ≈ π, since every phase is usually followed by a rewind of about the same length as the previous merge. From Table 5.4.2–1 we get the values α ≈ 0.795, β ≈ 0.864 − 2, in the case of six tapes.  We subtract 2 because the table entry includes the initial and final passes as well as the intermediate ones.  The time for rewinding the input tape after the initial distribution, namely ρN Cωiτ +δ, should be added to  9 . Example 3. Read-forward cascade merge. Table 5.4.3–1 gives the values α ≈ 0.773, β ≈ 0.808 − 2. Rewind time is comparatively difficult to estimate; perhaps setting π′ ≈ π is accurate enough. As in example 2, we need to add the initial rewind time to  9 . Example 4. Tape-splitting polyphase merge. Table 5.4.2–6 tells us that α ≈ 0.752, β ≈ 1.024 − 2. The rewind time is almost overlapped except after the initialization  ρN Cωiτ + δ  and two phases near the end  2ρN Cωτ times 36 percent . We may also subtract 0.18 from β since the first half phase is overlapped by the initial rewind. Example 5. Cascade merge with rewind overlap. In this case we use Table 5.4.3–1 for T = 5, to get α ≈ 0.897, β ≈ 0.800 − 2. Nearly all of the unoverlapped rewind occurs just after the initial distribution and just after each   334  SORTING  5.4.6  two-way merge. After a perfect initial distribution, the longest tape contains about 1 g of the data, where g is the “growth ratio.” After each two-way merge the amount of rewind in the six-tape case is dkdn−k  see exercise 5.4.3–5 , hence the amount of rewind after two-way merges in the T-tape case can be shown to be approximately  2  2T − 1 1 − cos4π  2T − 1   9 1 − cos 80◦  ≈ 0.184 of the file, and the  suggested by exercise 5.4.1–24, is S =N 3 + 1 P   6P ′  + 1. All rewind time  of the file. In our case, T = 5, this is 2 number of times it occurs is 0.946 ln S + 0.796 − 2. Example 6. Read-backward balanced merge. This is like example 1, ex- cept that most of the rewinding is eliminated. The change in direction from forward to backward causes some delays, but they are not significant. There is a 50-50 chance that rewinding will be necessary before the final pass, so we may take π′ = 1  2P . Example 7. Read-backward polyphase merge. Since replacement selec- tion in this case produces runs that change direction about every P times, we must replace  3  by another formula for S. A reasonably good approximation, is eliminated, and Table 5.4.2–1 gives α ≈ 0.863, β ≈ 0.921 − 2. Example 8. Read-backward cascade merge. From Table 5.4.3–1 we have α ≈ 0.897, β ≈ 0.800 − 2. The rewind time can be estimated as twice the difference between “passes with copying” minus “passes without copying” in that table, plus 1  2P  in case the final merge must be preceded by rewinding to get ascending order. Example 9. Read-backward oscillating sort. In this case replacement se- lection has to be started and stopped many times; bursts of P − 1 to 2P − 1 runs are distributed at a time, averaging P in length; the average length of runs therefore turns out to be approximately P ′ 2P − 4 3  P, and we may estimate distribution and vice-versa; this is approximately the time to read in P ′ records from the input tape, namely P ′Cωiτ, and it occurs about S P times. Rewind time and merging time may be estimated as in example 6. Example 10. Read-forward oscillating sort. This method is not easy to analyze, because the final “cleanup” phases performed after the input is ex- hausted are not as efficient as the earlier phases. Ignoring this troublesome aspect, and simply calling it one extra pass, we can estimate the merging time by setting α = 1 ln P, β = 0, and π′ = π P. The distribution of runs is somewhat different in this case, since replacement selection is not used; we set P ′ = M C and S = ⌈N P ′⌉. With care we will be able to overlap computing, reading, and writing during the distribution, with an additional factor of about  M+2B  M in the overhead. The “mode-switching” time mentioned in example 9 is not needed in the present case because it is overlapped by rewinding. So the estimated sorting time in this case is  9  plus 2BN Cωiτ  M.

The formulas in examples 2 and 3 indicate that cascade merge should be preferable to polyphase on six tapes, yet in practice polyphase was better. The reason is that graphs like Fig. 85  which shows the five-tape case  are more nearly straight lines for the polyphase algorithm; cascade is superior to polyphase on six tapes for 14 ≤ S ≤ 15 and 43 ≤ S ≤ 55, near the “perfect” cascade numbers 15 and 55, but the polyphase distribution of Algorithm 5.4.2D is equal or better for all other S ≤ 100. Cascade will win over polyphase as S → ∞, but S doesn’t actually approach ∞. The underestimate in example 9 is due to similar circumstances; polyphase was superior to oscillating even though the asymptotic theory tells us that oscillating will be better for large S. Some miscellaneous remarks. It is now appropriate to make a few more or less random observations about tape merging.    The formulas above show that the cost of tape sorting is essentially a function of N times C, not of N and C independently. Except for a few relatively minor considerations  such as the fact that B was taken to be a multiple of C , our formulas say that it takes about as long to sort one million records of 10 characters each as to sort 100,000 records of 100 characters each. Actually there may be a difference, not revealed in our formulas, because of the space used by link fields during replacement selection. In any event the size of the key makes hardly any difference, unless keys get so long and complicated that internal computation cannot keep up with the tapes.  With long records and short keys it is tempting to “detach” the keys, sort them first, and then somehow rearrange the records as a whole. But this idea doesn’t really work; it merely postpones the agony, because the final rearrange- ment procedure takes about as long as a conventional merge sort would take.    When writing a sort routine that is to be used repeatedly, it is wise to estimate the running time very carefully and to compare the theory with actual observed performance. Since the theory of sorting has been fairly well developed, this procedure has been known to turn up bugs in the input output hardware or   336  SORTING  5.4.6  software on existing systems; the service was substantially slower than it should have been, yet nobody had noticed it until the sorting routine ran too slowly!   Our analysis of replacement selection has been carried out for “random” files, but the files that actually arise in practice very often have a good deal of existing order.  In fact, sometimes people will sort a file that is already in order, just to be sure.  Therefore experience has shown that replacement selection is preferable to other kinds of internal sort, even more so than our formulas indicate. This advantage is slightly mitigated in the case of read-backward polyphase sorting, since a number of descending runs must be produced; indeed, R. L. Gilstad  who first published the polyphase merge  originally rejected the read-backward technique for that reason. But he noticed later that alternating directions will still pick up long ascending runs. Furthermore, read-backward polyphase is the only standard technique that likes descending input files as well as ascending ones.    Another advantage of replacement selection is that it allows simultaneous reading, writing, and computing. If we merely did the internal sort in an obvious way — filling the memory, sorting it, then writing it out as it becomes filled with the next load — the distribution pass would take about twice as long.  The only other internal sort we have discussed that appears to be amenable to simultaneous reading, writing, and computing is heapsort. Suppose for con- venience that the internal memory holds 1000 records, and that each block on tape holds 100. Example 10 of Chart A was prepared with the following strategy, letting B1 B2 . . . B10 stand for the contents of memory divided into ten 100-record blocks: Step 0. Fill memory, and make the elements of B2 . . . B10 satisfy the inequalities for a heap  with smallest element at the root . Step 1. Make B1 . . . B10 into a heap, then select out the least 100 records and move them to B10. Step 2. Write out B10, while selecting the smallest 100 records of B1 . . . B9 and moving them to B9. Step 3. Read into B10, and write out B9, while selecting the smallest 100 records of B1 . . . B8 and moving them to B8.  ...  Step 9. Read into B4, and write out B3, while selecting the smallest 100 records of B1 B2 and moving them to B2 and while making the heap inequalities valid in B5 . . . B10. Step 10. Read into B3, and write out B2, while sorting B1 and while making the heap inequalities valid in B4 . . . B10. Step 11. Read into B2, and write out B1, while making the heap inequalities valid in B3 . . . B10. Step 12. Read into B1, while making the heap inequalities valid in B2 . . . B10. Return to step 1.   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  337   We have been assuming that the number N of records to be sorted is not known in advance. Actually in most computer applications it would be possible to keep track of the number of records in all files at all times, and we could assume that our computer system is capable of telling us the value of N. How much help would this be? Unfortunately, not very much! We have seen that replacement selection is very advantageous, but it leads to an unpredictable number of initial runs. In a balanced merge we could use information about N to set the buffer size B in such a way that S will probably be just less than a power of P ; and in a polyphase distribution with optimum placement of dummy runs we could use information about N to decide what level to shoot for  see Table 5.4.2–2 .    Tape drives tend to be the least reliable part of a computer. Therefore the original input tape should never be destroyed until it is known that the entire sort has been satisfactorily completed. The “operator dismount time” is annoying in some of the examples of Chart A, but it would be too risky to overwrite the input in view of the probability that something might go wrong during a long sort.    When changing from forward write to backward read, we could save some time by never writing the last bufferload onto tape; it will just be read back in again anyway. But Chart A shows that this trick actually saves comparatively little time, except in the oscillating sort where directions are reversed frequently.   Although a large computer system might have lots of tape units, we might be better off not using them all. The percentage difference between logP S and logP +1 S is not very great when P is large, and a higher order of merge usually implies a smaller block size.  Consider also the poor computer operator who has to mount all those scratch tapes.  On the other hand, exercise 12 describes an interesting way to make use of additional tape units, grouping them so as to overlap input output time without increasing the order of merge.    On machines like MIX, which have fixed rather small block sizes, hardly any internal memory is needed while merging. Oscillating sort then becomes more attractive, because it becomes possible to maintain the replacement selection tree in memory while merging. In fact we can improve on oscillating sort in this case  as suggested by Colin J. Bell in 1962 , merging a new initial run into the output every time we merge from the working tapes.    We have observed that multireel files should be sorted one reel at a time, in order to avoid excessive tape handling. This is sometimes called a “reel time” application. Actually a balanced merge on six tapes can sort three reelfuls, up until the time of the final merge, if it has been programmed carefully.  To merge a fairly large number of individually sorted reels, a minimum- path-length merging tree will be fastest  see Section 5.4.4 . This construction was first made by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 166–167]; then W. H. Burge [Information and Control 1  1958 , 181–197] pointed out that an optimum way to merge runs of given  possibly unequal  lengths is obtained by constructing a tree with minimum weighted path length, using the run lengths as weights  see Sections 2.3.4.5 and 5.4.9 , if we ignore tape handling time.   338  SORTING  5.4.6   Our discussions have blithely assumed that we have direct control over the input output instructions for tape units, and that no complicated operating system keeps us from using tape as efficiently as the tape designers intended. These idealistic assumptions give us insights into the tape merging problem, and may give some insights into the proper design of operating system interfaces, but we should realize that multiprogramming and multiprocessing can make the situation considerably more complicated.    The issues we have studied in this section were first discussed in print by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 134–168], W. Zoberbier [Elektronische Daten- verarbeitung 5  1960 , 28–44], and M. A. Goetz [Digital Computer User’s Hand- book  New York: McGraw–Hill, 1967 , 1.292–1.320]. Summary. We can sum up what we have learned about the relative efficiencies of different approaches to tape sorting in the following way: Theorem A. situation.  It is difficult to decide which merge pattern is best in a given  The examples we have seen in Chart A show how 100,000 randomly ordered 100-character records  or 1 million 10-character records  might be sorted using six tapes under realistic assumptions. This much data fills about half of a tape, and it can be sorted in about 15 to 19 minutes on the MIXT tapes. However, there is considerable variation in available tape equipment, and running times for such a job could vary between about four minutes and about two hours on different machines of the 1970s. In our examples, about 3 minutes of the total time were used for initial distribution of runs and internal sorting; about 4 1 2 minutes were 2 to 11 1 used for the final merge and rewinding the output tape; and about 7 1 2 minutes were spent in intermediate stages of merging. Given six tapes that cannot read backwards, the best sorting method under our assumptions was the “tape-splitting polyphase merge”  example 4 ; and for tapes that do allow backward reading, the best method turned out to be read- backward polyphase with a complicated placement of dummy runs  example 7 . Oscillating sort  example 9  was a close second. In both cases the cascade merge provided a simpler alternative that was only slightly slower  examples 5 and 8 . In the read-forward case, a straightforward balanced merge  example 1  was surprisingly effective, partly by luck in this particular example but partly also because it spends comparatively little time rewinding.  The situation would change somewhat if we had a different number of  available tapes. Sort generators. Given the wide variability of data and equipment charac- teristics, it is almost impossible to write a single external sorting program that is satisfactory in a variety of different applications. And it is also rather difficult to prepare a program that really handles tapes efficiently. Therefore the preparation of sorting software is a particularly challenging job. A sort generator is a program that produces machine code specially tailored to particular sorting applications,   5.4.6  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  339  based on parameters that describe the data format and the hardware configura- tion. Such a program is often tied to high-level languages such as COBOL or PL I. One of the features normally provided by a sort generator is the ability to insert the user’s “own coding,” a sequence of special instructions to be in- corporated into the first and last passes of the sorting routine. First-pass own coding is usually used to edit the input records, often shrinking them or slightly expanding them into a form that is easier to sort. For example, suppose that the input records are to be sorted on a nine-character key that represents a date in month-day-year format:  JUL041776 OCT311517 NOV051605 JUL141789 NOV071917  On the first pass the three-letter month code can be looked up in a table, and the month codes can be replaced by numbers with the most significant fields at the left:  17760704 15171031 16051105 17890714 19171107  This decreases the record length and makes subsequent comparisons much sim- pler.  An even more compact code could also be substituted.  Last-pass own coding can be used to restore the original format, and or to make other desired changes to the file, and or to compute some function of the output records. The merging algorithms we have studied are organized in such a way that it is easy to distinguish the last pass from other merges. Notice that when own coding is present there must be at least two passes over the file even if it is initially in order. Own coding that changes the record size can make it difficult for the oscillating sort to overlap some of its input output operations.  Sort generators also take care of system details like tape label conventions, and they often provide for “hash totals” or other checks to make sure that none of the data has been lost or altered. Sometimes there are provisions for stopping the sort at convenient places and resuming later. The fanciest generators allow records to have dynamically varying lengths [see D. J. Waks, CACM 6  1963 , 267–272]. *Merging with fewer buffers. We have seen that 2P + 2 buffers are sufficient to keep tapes moving rapidly during a P-way merge. Let us conclude this section by making a mathematical analysis of the merging time when fewer than 2P +2 buffers are present.  Two output buffers are clearly desirable, since we can be writing from one while forming the next block of output in the other. Therefore we may ignore the output question entirely, and concentrate only on the input. Suppose there are P + Q input buffers, where 1 ≤ Q ≤ P. We shall use the following approximate model of the situation, as suggested by L. J. Woodrum [IBM Systems J. 9  1970 , 118–144]: It takes one unit of time to read a block of tape. During this time there is a probability p0 that no input buffers have been emptied, p1 that one has been emptied, p≥2 that two or more have been, etc. When completing a tape read we are in one of Q + 1 states:   340  SORTING  5.4.6  State 0. Q buffers are empty; we begin to read a block into one of them from the appropriate file, using the forecasting technique explained earlier in this section. After one unit of time we go to state 1 with probability p0, otherwise we remain in state 0. State 1. Q − 1 buffers are empty; we begin to read into one of them, forecasting the appropriate file. After one unit of time we go to state 2 with probability p0, to state 1 with probability p1, and to state 0 with probability p≥2. State Q − 1. One buffer is empty; we begin to read into it, forecasting the appropriate file. After one unit of time we go to state Q with probability p0, to state Q − 1 with probability p1, . . . , to state 1 with probability pQ−1, and to state 0 with probability p≥Q. State Q. All buffers are filled. Tape reading stops for an average of µ units of time and then we go to state Q − 1.  ...  n≥0 a Q   1− z. Now let gQ z  =  We start in state 0. This model of the situation corresponds to a Markov process  see exercise 2.3.4.2–26 , which can be analyzed via generating functions in the following interesting way: Let z be an arbitrary parameter, and assume that each time we have a chance to read from tape we make a decision to do so with probability z, but we decide to terminate the algorithm with probability n zn 1− z  be the average number of times that is the average number of state Q occurs in such a process; it follows that a Q  n µ is times state Q occurs when exactly n blocks have been read. Then n + a Q  the average total time for input plus computation. If we had perfect overlap, as in the  2P + 2 -buffer algorithm, the total time would be only n units, so a Q  n µ represents the “reading hangup” time. Let Aij be the probability that we go from state i to state j in this process, for 0 ≤ i, j ≤ Q + 1, where Q + 1 is a new “stopped” state. For example, the A-matrix takes the following forms for small Q: 1 − z 0 0   ,  p0z 0 0  Q = 1:  n  1 0   p≥1z  p≥1z   p≥1z p≥2z p≥3z 0 0  p≥2z 0 0  Q = 2:  Q = 3:  p0z p1z 1 0  p0z p1z p2z 0 0  0 p0z 0 0  0 p0z p1z 1 0  1 − z 1 − z 0 0  0 0 p0z 0 0   ,   .  1 − z 1 − z 1 − z 0 0    =  det  n≥0  PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR TAPE MERGING  5.4.6 341 Exercise 2.3.4.2–26 b  tells us that gQ z  = cofactorQ0 I − A  det I − A .

This of course was obvious a priori, since the problem is very so a simple when Q = 1.

For example, when P = 5 we have p0 = .32768, p1 = .4096, p2 = .2048, p3 = .0512, p4 = .0064, and p5 = .00032; hence α 1  ≈ 0.328, α 2  ≈ 0.182, and α 3  ≈ 0.125. In other words, if we use 5 + 3 input buffers instead of 5 + 5, we can expect an additional “reading hangup” time of about 0.125 5 ≈ 2.5 percent. Of course this model is only a very rough approximation; we know that when Q = P there is no hangup time at all, but the model says that there is. The extra reading hangup time for smaller Q just about counterbalances the savings in overhead gained by having larger blocks, so the simple scheme with Q = P seems to be vindicated.  EXERCISES 1. [13] Give a formula for the exact number of characters per tape, when every block on the tape contains n characters.

[22] What changes should be made to Algorithm 5.4.3C in order to convert it into an algorithm for cascade merge with rewind overlap, on T + 1 tapes?   cid:120  7.

Hint: To preserve parity it is necessary to insert many of the A0’s and D0’s as adjacent pairs. The merge numbers for each initial run may be computed as in exercise 5.4.4–5; some simplification occurs since adjacent runs always have adjacent merge numbers. 8. [20] Chart A shows that most of the schemes for initial distribution of runs  with the exception of the initial distribution for the cascade merge  tend to put consecutive runs onto different tapes. If consecutive runs went onto the same tape we could save the stop start time; would it therefore be a good idea to modify the distribution algorithms so that they switch tapes less often?   cid:120  9. [22] Estimate how long the read-backward polyphase algorithm would have taken  in Chart A, if we had used all T = 6 tapes for sorting, instead of T = 5 as in example 7.

[M23] Use the analyses in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 to show that the length of each rewind during a standard six-tape polyphase or cascade merge is rarely more than about 54 percent of the file  except for the initial and final rewinds, which cover the entire file . 11. [23] By modifying the appropriate entries in Table 1, estimate how long the first nine examples of Chart A would have taken if we had a combined low speed high speed rewind. Assume that ρ = 1 when the tape is less than about one-fourth full, and that the rewind time for fuller tapes is approximately five seconds plus the time that would be obtained for ρ = 1 5. Change example 8 so that it uses cascade merge with copying, since rewinding and reading forward is slower than copying in this case. [Hint: Use the result of exercise 10.] 12. [40] Consider partitioning six tapes into three pairs of tapes, with each pair playing the role of a single tape in a polyphase merge with T = 3. One tape of each pair will contains blocks 1, 3, 5, . . . and the other tape will contain blocks 2, 4, 6, . . . ; in this way we can essentially have two input tapes and two output tapes active at all times while merging, effectively doubling the merging speed. a  Find an appropriate way to extend Algorithm F to this situation.

External Radix Sorting The previous sections have discussed the process of tape sorting by merging; but there is another way to sort with tapes, based on the radix sorting principle that was once used in mechanical card sorters  see Section 5.2.5 . This method is sometimes called distribution sorting, column sorting, pocket sorting, digital sorting, separation sorting, etc.; it turns out to be essentially the opposite of merging!  —  T1  T4 —  T2 — —  {0, 2, 4, 6}  {0, 4}{1, 5}  {2, 6}{3, 7}  {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}  Suppose, for example, that we have four tapes and that there are only eight possible keys: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. If the input data is on tape T1, we can begin by transferring all even keys to T3, all odd keys to T4: T3 —  Given {1, 3, 5, 7} Pass 1 Now we rewind, and read T3 and then T4, putting {0, 1, 4, 5} on T1 and {2, 3, 6, 7} on T2: Pass 2  The notation “{0, 4}{1, 5}” stands for a file that contains some records whose keys are all 0 or 4 followed by records whose keys are all 1 or 5. Notice that T1 now contains those keys whose middle binary digit is 0.  After rewinding again and distributing 0, 1, 2, 3 to T3 and 4, 5, 6, 7 to T4, we have {4}{5}{6}{7} {0}{1}{2}{3} Pass 3 Now we can finish up by copying T4 to the end of T3. In general, if the keys range from 0 to 2k −1, we could sort the file in an analogous way using k passes, followed by a final collection phase that copies about half of the data from one tape to another. With six tapes we could use radix 3 representations in a similar way, to sort keys from 0 to 3k − 1 in k passes. Partial-pass methods can also be used. For example, suppose that there are ten possible keys {0, 1, . . . , 9}, and consider the following procedure due to  —  —   344  SORTING  5.4.7  {0, 1, . . . , 9}  R. L. Ashenhurst [Theory of Switching, Progress Report BL-7  Harvard Univ. Comp. Laboratory: May 1954 , I.1–I.76]: Phase  passes  T1  T2 —  T3 —  T4 —  —  — {0}  — {9}  {1, 5, 6}  {1, 5, 6}{2, 7}  {0, 2, 4, 7} {6}{7} {6}{7}{8}  {3, 8, 9} {3, 8, 9}{4} {3, 8, 9}{4}{5}  {0}{1}{2} {0}{1}{2}{3}  1 2 3 4 C {0}{1}{2}{3}{4} . . .{9}  1.0 0.4 0.5 0.3 0.6 2.8 Here C represents the collection phase. If each key value occurs about one-tenth of the time, the procedure above takes only 2.8 passes to sort ten keys, while the first example required 3.5 passes to sort only eight keys. Therefore we find that a clever distribution pattern can make a significant difference, for radix sorting as well as for merging.  {4}{5}  The distribution patterns in the examples above can conveniently be repre-  sented as tree structures:  Example 1  Example 2  The circular internal nodes of these trees are numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , corre- sponding to steps 1, 2, 3, . . . of the process. Tape names A, B, C, D  instead of T1, T2, T3, T4  have been placed next to the lines of the trees, in order to show where the records go. Square external nodes represent portions of a file that contain only one key, and that key is shown in boldface type just below the node. The lines just above square nodes all carry the name of the output tape  C in the first example, A in the second .  Thus, step 3 of example 1 consists of reading from tape D and writing 1s and 5s on tape A, 3s and 7s on tape B. It is not difficult to see that the number of passes performed is equal to the external path length of the tree divided by the number of external nodes, if we assume that each key occurs equally often.  A  1  C  2  B  6  D  3  A  5  B  7  C  D  C  2  1  C  10  C  6  D  9  C  3  D  11  C  5  7  C  0  A  4  D  8  C  4  A  1  B  C  D  A  C  D  A  B  A  B  C  3  8  D  7  5  10  11  0  A  B  A  A  A  A  A  1  3  2  6  5  8  9  2  4  9  A  7  6  4   5.4.7  EXTERNAL RADIX SORTING  345  Because of the sequential nature of tape, and the first-in-first-out discipline of forwards reading, we can’t simply use any labeled tree as the basis of a distribution pattern. In the tree of example 1, data gets written on tape A during step 2 and step 3; it is necessary to use the data written during step 2 before we use the data written during step 3. In general if we write onto a tape during steps i and j, where i < j, we must use the data written during step i first; when the tree contains two branches of the form  ,  i < j,  we must have k < l. Furthermore we cannot write anything onto tape A between steps k and l, because we must rewind between reading and writing.  The reader who has worked the exercises of Section 5.4.4 will now immedi- ately perceive that the allowable trees for read-forward radix sorting on T tapes are precisely the strongly T-fifo trees, which characterize read-forward merge sorting on T tapes!  See exercise 5.4.4–20.  The only difference is that all of the external nodes on the trees we are considering here have the same tape labels. We could remove this restriction by assuming a final collection phase that transfers all records to an output tape, or we could add that restriction to the rules for T-fifo trees by requiring that the initial distribution pass of a merge sort be explicitly represented in the corresponding merge tree.  In other words, every merge pattern corresponds to a distribution pattern, and every distribution pattern corresponds to a merge pattern. A moment’s reflection shows why this is so, if we consider the actions of a merge sort and imagine that time could run backwards: The final output is “unmerged” into subfiles, which are unmerged into others, etc.; at time zero the output has been unmerged into S runs. Such a pattern is possible with tapes if and only if the corresponding radix sort distribution pattern, for S keys, is possible. This duality between merging and distribution is almost perfect; it breaks down only in one respect, namely that the input tape must be saved at different times.  The eight-key example treated at the beginning of this section is clearly dual to a balanced merge on four tapes. The ten-key example with partial passes corresponds to the following ten-run merge pattern  if we suppress the copy phases, steps 6–11 in the tree :  Initial distribution  Tree step 5 Tree step 4 Tree step 3 Tree step 2 Tree step 1  T1 14 13 12 11 — 101  T2 13 12 11 — 41 —  T3 11 — 21 2131 31 —  T4 12 1231 1231 1131 31 —  If we compare this to the radix sort, we see that the methods have essentially the same structure but are reversed in time, with the tape contents also reversed  A  i  k  A  j  l   T2 —  T3 —  —  346  SORTING  5.4.7  from back to front: 1231  two runs each of length 1 followed by one of length 3  corresponds to {3, 8, 9}{4}{5}  two subfiles containing one key each, preceded by one subfile containing three .  Going the other way, we can in principle construct a radix sort dual to polyphase merge, another one dual to cascade merge, etc. For example, the 21-run polyphase merge on three tapes, illustrated at the beginning of Section 5.4.2, corresponds to the following interesting radix sort: Phase  T1  {0,1, ... ,20}  —  {0,5,10,13,18}{1,6,11,14,19}  {0,5,10,13,18} {2,7,12,15,20}  —  1 2  3  4  {0,2,4,5,7,9,10,12,13,15,17,18,20} {1,3,6,8,11,14,16,19} {1,3,6,8,11,14,16,19} {2,4,7,9,12,15,17,20}  —  {3,8,16}{4,9,17} {6,11,19}{7,12,20}  {3,8,16}{4,9,17}{5,10,18}  {0,13}{1,14}{2,15} {0,13}{1,14}{2,15} {3,16}...{7,20}  —  —  {0}{1}...{7}  {8}{9}{10}{11}{12}  5 6 {8}{9}{10}{11}{12}{13}...{20} The distribution rule used here to decide which keys go on which tapes at each step appears to be magic, but in fact it has a simple connection with the Fibonacci number system.  See exercise 2.  Reading backwards. Duality between radix sorting and merging applies also to algorithms that read tapes backwards. We have defined “T-lifo trees” in Section 5.4.4, and it is easy to see that they correspond to radix sorts as well as to merge sorts.  A read-backward radix sort was actually considered by John Mauchly al- ready in 1946, in one of the first papers ever to be published about sorting  see Section 5.5 ; Mauchly essentially gave the following construction: Phase  T2  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}  T3 —  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  {2, 3, 6, 7}  {0, 1, 8, 9} {0, 1, 8, 9}  . . — —  — {3, 6}  — — {9} . .  {4, 5}{2, 7}{0, 9}  {3, 6}{1, 8} {3, 6}{1, 8} . .  {4, 5}{2, 7} {4, 5}{2, 7} . .  1 2 3 4 . . . 8 {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}{5} . . .{9} C His scheme is not the most efficient one possible, but it is interesting because it shows that partial pass methods were considered for radix sorting already in 1946, although they did not appear in the literature for merging until about 1960. An efficient construction of read-backward distribution patterns has been suggested by A. Bayes [CACM 11  1968 , 491–493]: Given P + 1 tapes and S keys, divide the keys into P subfiles each containing ⌊S P⌋ or ⌈S P⌉ keys,  . . {9}{8}{7}{6}{5}  . . {0}{1}{2}{3}{4}  — {0} .  . . — —  —  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  T1 — {4, 5}  T4 —   5.4.7  EXTERNAL RADIX SORTING  347  and apply this procedure recursively to each subfile. When S < 2P, one subfile should consist of the smallest key alone, and it should be written onto the output file.  R. M. Karp’s general preorder construction, which appears at the end of Section 5.4.4, includes this method as a special case.   Backward reading makes merging a little more complicated because it re- verses the order of runs. There is a corresponding effect on radix sorting: The outcome is stable or “anti-stable” depending on what level is reached in the tree. After a read-backward radix sort in which some of the external nodes are at odd levels and some are at even levels, the relative order of different records with equal keys will be the same as the original order for some keys, but it will be the opposite of the original order for the other keys.  See exercise 6.   Oscillating merge sorts have their counterparts too, under duality. In an oscillating radix sort we continue to separate out the keys until reaching subfiles that have only one key or are small enough to be internally sorted; such subfiles are sorted and written onto the output tape, then the separation process is resumed. For example, if we have three work tapes and one output tape, and if the keys are binary numbers, we may start by putting keys of the form 0x on tape T1, keys 1x on T2. If T1 receives more than one memory load, we scan it again and put 00x on T2 and 01x on T3. Now if the 00x subfile is short enough to be internally sorted, we do so and output the result, then continue by processing the 01x subfile. Such a method was called a “cascading pseudo-radix sort” by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 157–159]; it was developed further by H. Nagler [JACM 6  1959 , 459–468], who gave it the colorful name “amphisbaenic sort,” and by C. H. Gaudette [IBM Tech. Disclosure Bull. 12  April 1970 , 1849–1853]. Does radix sorting beat merging? One important consequence of the duality principle is that radix sorting is usually inferior to merge sorting. This happens because the technique of replacement selection gives merge sorting a definite advantage; there is no apparent way to arrange radix sorts so that we can make use of internal sorts encompassing more than one memory load at a time. Indeed, the oscillating radix sort will often produce subfiles that are somewhat smaller than one memory load, so the distribution pattern will correspond to a tree with many more external nodes than would be present if merging and replacement selection were used. Consequently the external path length of the tree — the sorting time — will be increased.  See exercise 5.3.1–33.   On the other hand, external radix sorting does have its uses. Suppose, for example, that we have a file containing the names of all employees of a large corporation, in alphabetic order; the corporation has 10 divisions, and it is desired to sort the file by division, retaining the alphabetic order of the employees in each division. This is a perfect situation in which to apply a stable radix sort, if the file is long, since the number of records that belong to each of the 10 divisions is likely to be more than the number of records that would be obtained in initial runs produced by replacement selection. In general, if the range of key values is so small that the collection of records having a given key is expected to fill the internal memory more than twice, it is wise to use a radix sort technique.   348  SORTING  5.4.7  We have seen in Section 5.2.5 that internal radix sorting is superior to merging, on certain high-speed computers, because the inner loop of the radix sort algorithm avoids complicated branching. If the external memory is especially fast, it may be impossible for such machines to merge data rapidly enough to keep up with the input output equipment. Radix sorting may therefore turn out to be superior to merging in such a situation, especially if the keys are known to be uniformly distributed.  EXERCISES 1. [20] The general T -tape balanced merge with parameter P , 1 ≤ P < T, was defined near the beginning of Section 5.4. Show that this corresponds to a radix sort based on a mixed-radix number system. 2. [M28] The text illustrates the three-tape polyphase radix sort for 21 keys. Gener- alize to the case of Fn keys; explain what keys appear on what tapes at the end of each phase. [Hint: Consider the Fibonacci number system, exercise 1.2.8–34.] 3. [M35] Extend the results of exercise 2 to the polyphase radix sort on four or more tapes.  See exercise 5.4.2–10.  4. [M23] Prove that Ashenhurst’s distribution pattern is the best way to sort 10 keys on four tapes without reading backwards, in the sense that the associated tree has minimum external path length over all strongly 4-fifo trees.  Thus, it is essentially the best method if we ignore rewind time.  5. [15] Draw the 4-lifo tree corresponding to Mauchly’s read-backwards radix sort for 10 keys.   cid:120  6. [20] A certain file contains two-digit keys 00, 01,  . . . , 99. After performing Mauchly’s radix sort on the least significant digits, we can repeat the same scheme on the most significant digits, interchanging the roles of tapes T2 and T4. In what order will the keys finally appear on T2? 7. [21] Does the duality principle apply also to multireel files?  *5.4.8. Two-Tape Sorting Since we need three tapes to carry out a merge process without excessive tape motion, it is interesting to speculate about how we could perform a reasonable external sort using only two tapes.  One approach, suggested by H. B. Demuth in 1956, is sort of a combined replacement-selection and bubble sort. Assume that the input is on tape T1, and begin by reading P + 1 records into memory. Now output the record whose key is smallest, to tape T2, and replace it by the next input record. Continue outputting a record whose key is currently the smallest in memory, maintaining a selection tree or a priority queue of P + 1 elements. When the input is finally exhausted, the largest P keys of the file will be present in memory; output them in ascending order. Now rewind both tapes and repeat the process by reading from T2 and writing to T1; each such pass puts at least P more records into their proper place. A simple test can be built into the program that determines when the entire file is in sort. At most ⌈ N − 1  P⌉ passes will be necessary.   5.4.8  TWO-TAPE SORTING  349  A few moments’ reflection shows that each pass of this procedure is essen- tially equivalent to P consecutive passes of the bubble sort  Algorithm 5.2.2B . If an element has P or more inversions, it will be smaller than everything in the tree when it is input, so it will be output immediately — thereby losing P inversions. If an element has fewer than P inversions, it will go into the selection tree and will be output before all greater keys — thereby losing all its inversions. When P = 1, this is exactly what happens in the bubble sort, by Theorem 5.2.2I. The total number of passes will therefore be ⌈I P⌉, where I is the maximum number of inversions of any element. By the theory developed in Section 5.2.2,  the average value of I is N −πN 2 + 2 3 + O1   N.  If the file is not too much larger than the memory size, or if it is nearly in order to begin with, this order-P bubble sort will be fairly rapid; in fact, such a method might be advantageous even when extra tape units are available, because scratch tapes must be mounted by a human operator. But a two-tape bubble sort will run quite slowly on fairly long, randomly ordered files, since its average running time will be approximately proportional to N 2.  Let us consider how this method might be implemented for the 100,000- record example of Section 5.4.6. We need to choose P intelligently, in order to compensate for interblock gaps while doing simultaneous reading, writing, and computing. Since the example assumes that each record is 100 characters long and that 100,000 characters will fit into memory, we can make room for two input buffers and two output buffers of size B by setting  √  100 P + 1  + 4B = 100000.   1  Using the notation of Section 5.4.6, the running time for each pass will be about  2  Since the number of passes is inversely proportional to P, we want to choose B to be a multiple of 100 that minimizes the quantity ω P. Elementary calculus shows  that this occurs when B is approximately 24975γ + γ2 − γ, so we take B =  ω =  B + γ  B.  N Cωτ 1 + ρ ,  3000, P = 879. Setting N = 100000 in the formulas above shows that the number of passes ⌈I P⌉ will be about 114, and the total estimated running time will be approximately 8.57 hours  assuming for convenience that the initial input and the final output also have B = 3000 . This represents approximately 0.44 reelfuls of data; a full reel would take about five times as long. Some improvements could be made if the algorithm were interrupted periodically, writing the records with largest keys onto an auxiliary tape that is dismounted, since such records are merely copied back and forth once they have been put into order. Application of quicksort. Another internal sorting method that traverses the data in a nearly sequential manner is the partition exchange or quicksort procedure, Algorithm 5.2.2Q. Can we adapt it to two tapes? [N. B. Yoash, CACM 8  1965 , 649.]  It is not difficult to see how this can indeed be done, using backward reading. Assume that the two tapes are numbered 0 and 1, and imagine that the file is   350  SORTING  laid out as follows:  5.4.8  Each tape serves as a stack; putting them together like this makes it possible to view the file as a linear list in which we can move the current position left or right by copying from one stack to the other. The following recursive subroutines define a suitable sorting procedure:   SORT00 [Sort the top subfile on tape 0 and return it to tape 0]. If the subfile fits in the internal memory, sort it internally and return it to tape. Otherwise select one record R from the subfile, and let its key be K. Reading backwards on tape 0, copy all records whose key is > K, forming a new subfile on the top of tape 1. Now read forward on tape 0, copying all records whose key is = K onto tape 1. Then read backwards again, copying all records whose key is < K onto tape 1. Complete the sort by executing SORT10 on the < K keys, then copying the = K keys to tape 0, and finally executing SORT10 on the > K keys.   SORT01 [Sort the top subfile on tape 0 and write it on tape 1]. Same as SORT00, but the final “SORT10” is changed to “SORT11” followed by copying the ≤ K keys to tape 1.   SORT10 [Sort the top subfile on tape 1 and write it on tape 0]. Same as SORT01, interchanging 0 with 1 and  .   SORT11 [Sort the top subfile on tape 1 and return it to tape 1]. Same as SORT00, interchanging 0 with 1 and  . The recursive nature of these subroutines can be handled without difficulty by storing appropriate control information on the tapes.  The running time for this algorithm can be estimated as follows, if we assume that the data are in random order, with negligible probability of equal keys. Let M be the number of records that fit into internal memory. Let XN be the average number of records read while applying SORT00 or SORT11 to a subfile of N records, when N > M, and let YN be the corresponding quantity for SORT01 or SORT10.

We also know from Eq. 5.2.2– 25  that the average number of internal sort phases will be 2 N + 1   M + 2  − 1.  Tape 0  Tape 1  Beginning of tape  “bottom”   Current position  “top”   Current position  “top”   Beginning of tape  “bottom”    5.4.8  TWO-TAPE SORTING  351  If we apply this analysis to the 100,000-record example of Section 5.4.6, using 25,000-character buffers and assuming that the sorting time is 2nCωτ for a subfile of n ≤ M = 1000 records, we obtain an average sorting time of approximately 103 minutes  including the final rewind as in Chart A . Thus the quicksort method isn’t bad, on the average; but of course its worst case turns out to be even more awful than the bubble sort discussed above. Randomization will make the worst case extremely unlikely. Radix sorting. The radix exchange method  Algorithm 5.2.2R  can be adapted to two-tape sorting in a similar way, since it is so much like quicksort. The trick that makes both of these methods work is the idea of reading a file more than once, something we never did in our previous tape algorithms.  The same trick can be used to do a conventional least-significant-digit-first radix sort on two tapes. Given the input data on T1, we copy all records onto T2 whose key ends with 0 in binary notation; then after rewinding T1 we read it again, copying the records whose key ends with 1. Now both tapes are rewound and a similar pair of passes is made, interchanging the roles of T1 and T2, and using the second least significant binary digit. At this point T1 will contain all records whose keys are  . . . 00 2, followed by those whose keys are  . . . 01 2, then  . . . 10 2, then  . . . 11 2. If the keys are b bits long, we need only 2b passes over the file in order to complete the sort.  Such a radix sort could be applied only to the leading b bits of the keys, for some judiciously chosen number b; that would reduce the number of inversions by a factor of about 2b, if the keys were uniformly distributed, so a few passes of the P-way bubble sort could then be used to complete the job. This approach reads tape in the forward direction only.  A novel but somewhat more complicated approach to two-tape distribution sorting has been suggested by A. I. Nikitin and L. I. Sholmov [Kibernetika 2, 6  1966 , 79–84]. Counts are made of the number of keys having each possible configuration of leading bits, and artificial keys κ1, κ2, . . . , κM based on these counts are constructed so that the number of actual keys lying between κi and κi+1 is between predetermined limits P1 and P2, for each i. Thus, M lies between ⌈N P2⌉ and ⌈N P1⌉. If the leading bit counts do not give sufficient information to determine such κ1, κ2, . . . , κM, one or more further passes are made to count the frequency of less significant bit patterns, for certain configurations of most significant bits. After the table of artificial keys κ1, κ2, . . . , κM has been con- structed, 2⌈lg M⌉ further passes will suffice to complete the sort.  This method requires memory space proportional to N, so it can’t be used for external sorting as N → ∞. In practice we would not use the technique for multireel files, so M will be comparatively small and the table of artificial keys will fit comfortably in memory.  Simulation of more tapes. F. C. Hennie and R. E. Stearns have devised a general technique for simulating k tapes on only two tapes, in such a way that the tape motion required is increased by a factor of only O log L , where L is the maximum distance to be traveled on any one tape [JACM 13  1966 , 533–546].   352  SORTING  5.4.8  Fig. 86. Layout of tape T1 in the Hennie–Stearns construction; nonblank zones are shaded.  Their construction can be simplified slightly in the case of sorting, as in the following method suggested by R. M. Karp.  We shall simulate an ordinary four-tape balanced merge, using two tapes T1 and T2. The first of these, T1, holds the simulated tape contents in a way that may be diagrammed as in Fig. 86; we imagine that the data is written in four “tracks,” one for each simulated tape.  In actual fact the tape doesn’t have such tracks; blocks 1, 5, 9, 13, . . . are thought of as Track 1, blocks 2, 6, 10, 14, . . . as Track 2, etc.  The other tape, T2, is used only for auxiliary storage, to help move things around on T1.  The blocks of each track are divided into zones, containing, respectively, 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . , 2k, . . . blocks per zone. Zone k on each track is either filled with exactly 2k blocks of data, or it is completely blank. In Fig. 86, for example, Track 1 has data in zones 1 and 3; Track 2 in zones 0, 1, 2; Track 3 in zones 0 and 2; Track 4 in zone 1; and the other zones are blank.  Suppose that we are merging data from Tracks 1 and 2 to Track 3. The internal computer memory contains two buffers used for input to a two-way merge, plus a third buffer for output. When the input buffer for Track 1 becomes empty, we can refill it as follows: Find the first nonempty zone on Track 1, say zone k, and copy its first block into the input buffer; then copy the other 2k − 1 blocks of data onto T2, and move them to zones 0, 1, . . . , k−1 of Track 1.  Zones 0, 1, . . . , k−1 are now full and zone k is blank.  An analogous procedure is used to refill the input buffer for Track 2, whenever it becomes empty. When the output buffer is ready to be written on Track 3, we reverse the process, scanning across T1 to find the first blank zone on Track 3, say zone k, while copying the data from zones 0, 1, . . . , k−1 onto T2. The data on T2, augmented by the contents of the output buffer, is now used to fill zone k of Track 3.  This procedure requires the ability to write in the middle of tape T1, without destroying subsequent information on that tape. As in the case of read-forward oscillating sort  Section 5.4.5 , it is possible to do this reliably if suitable pre- cautions are taken. The amount of tape motion required to bring 2l − 1 blocks of Track 1 into 0≤k<l 2l−1−k · c · 2k = c l2l−1, for some constant c, since we scan up to zone k only once in every 2k steps. Thus each merge pass requires O N log N  steps. Since there are O log N  passes in a balanced merge, the total time to  memory is  Zone 0 Zone 1  Zone 2  Track 1  Track 2  Track 3  Track 4  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  Zone 3  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52   5.4.8  sort is guaranteed to be ON log N 2 in the worst case; this is asymptotically  TWO-TAPE SORTING  353  much better than the worst case of quicksort.  But this method wouldn’t work very well if we applied it to the 100,000- record example of Section 5.4.6, since the information specified for tape T1 would overflow the contents of one tape reel. Even if we ignore this fact, and if we use optimistic assumptions about read write compute overlap and interblock gap lengths, etc., we find that roughly 37 hours would be required to complete the  sort! So this method is purely of academic interest; the constant in ON log N 2  is much too high to be satisfactory when N is in a practical range. One-tape sorting. Could we live with only one tape? It is not difficult to see that the order-P bubble sort described above could be converted into a one-tape sort, but the result would be ghastly.  H. B. Demuth [Ph.D. thesis  Stanford University, 1956 , 85] observed that a computer with bounded internal memory cannot reduce the number of inversions of a permutation by more than a bounded amount as it moves a bounded distance on tape; hence every one-tape sorting algorithm must take at least N 2d units of time on the average, for some positive constant d that depends on the computer configuration.  R. M. Karp has pursued this topic in a very interesting way, discovering an essentially optimum way to sort with one tape. It is convenient to discuss Karp’s algorithm by reformulating the problem as follows: What is the fastest way to transport people between floors using a single elevator? [See Combinatorial Algorithms, edited by Randall Rustin  Algorithmics Press, 1972 , 17–21.]  Consider a building with n floors, having room for exactly b people on each floor. The building contains no doors, windows, or stairs, but it does have an elevator that can stop on each floor. There are bn people in the building, and exactly b of them want to be on each particular floor. The elevator holds at most m people, and it takes one unit of time to go from floor i to floor i ± 1. We wish to find the quickest way to get all the people onto the proper floors, if the elevator is required to start and finish on floor 1.  The connection between this elevator problem and one-tape sorting is not hard to see: The people are the records and the building is the tape. The floors are individual blocks on the tape, and the elevator is the internal computer memory. A computer program has more flexibility than an elevator operator  it can, for example, duplicate people, or temporarily chop them into two parts on different floors, etc. ; but the solution below solves the problem in the fastest conceivable time without doing such operations.  The following two auxiliary tables are required by Karp’s algorithm.  uk, 1 ≤ k ≤ n: Number of people on floors ≤ k whose destination is > k;  4  dk, 1 ≤ k ≤ n: Number of people on floors ≥ k whose destination is < k. When the elevator is empty, we always have uk = dk+1 for 1 ≤ k < n, since there are b people on every floor; the number of misfits on floors {1, . . . , k} must equal the corresponding number on floors {k+1, . . . , n}. By definition, un = d1 = 0.   354  SORTING  5.4.8  Fig. 87. Karp’s elevator algorithm.  It is clear that the elevator must make at least ⌈uk m⌉ trips from floor k to floor k + 1, for 1 ≤ k < n, since only m passengers can ascend on each trip. Similarly it must make at least ⌈dk m⌉ trips from floor k to floor k−1. Therefore the elevator must necessarily take at least  ⌈uk m⌉ + ⌈dk m⌉  n  k=1   5   units of time on any correct schedule. Karp discovered that this lower bound can actually be achieved, when u1, . . . , un−1 are nonzero. Theorem K. If uk > 0 for 1 ≤ k < n, there is an elevator schedule that delivers everyone to the correct floor in the minimum time  5 . Proof. Assume that there are m extra people in the building; they start in the elevator and their destination floor is artificially set to 0. The elevator can operate according to the following algorithm, starting with k  the current floor  equal to 1: K1. [Move up.] From among the b + m people currently in the elevator or on floor k, those m with the highest destinations get into the elevator, and the others remain on floor k. Let there be u people now in the elevator whose destination is > k, and d whose destination is ≤ k.  It will turn out that u = min m, uk ; if uk < m we may therefore be transporting some people away from their destination. This represents their sacrifice to the common good.  Decrease uk by u, increase dk+1 by d, and then increase k by 1.  K2. [Still going up?] If uk > 0, return to step K1. K3. [Move down.] From among the b + m people currently in the elevator or on floor k, those m with the lowest destinations get into the elevator, and the others remain on floor k. Let there be u people now in the elevator whose destination is ≥ k, and d whose destination is < k.  It will always turn out that u = 0 and d = m, but the algorithm is described here in terms of general u and d in order to make the proof a little clearer.  Decrease dk by d, increase uk−1 by u, and then decrease k by 1.  K1. Move up  K3. Move down  uk > 0  K2. Still going up?  uk = 0  k > 1, uk−1 > 0  K4.

An optimum way to rearrange people using a small, slow elevator.  People are each represented by the number of their destination floor.  K4. [Still going down?] If k > 1 and uk−1 > 0, return to step K3. If k = 1 and u1 = 0, terminate the algorithm  everyone has arrived safely and the m “extras” are back in the elevator . Otherwise return to step K2. Figure 88 shows an example of this algorithm, with a nine-floor building and b = 2, m = 3. Note that one of the 6s is temporarily transported to floor 7, in spite of the fact that the elevator travels the minimum possible distance. The idea of testing uk−1 in step K4 is the crux of the algorithm, as we shall see. To verify the validity of this algorithm, we note that steps K1 and K3 always keep the u and d tables  4  up to date, if we regard the people in the elevator as being on the “current” floor k. It is now possible to prove by induction that the following properties hold at the beginning of each step:  ul+1 = 0,  ul = dl+1, ul = dl+1 − m,  for k ≤ l < n; for 1 ≤ l < k; if ul = 0 and k ≤ l < n.   6   7   8  Furthermore, at the beginning of step K1, the min  uk, m  people with highest destinations, among all people on floors ≤ k with destination > k, are in the elevator or on floor k. At the beginning of step K3, the min  dk, m  people with lowest destinations, among all people on floors ≥ k with destination < k, are in the elevator or on floor k. From these properties it follows that the parenthesized remarks in steps K1 and K3 are valid. Each execution of step K1 therefore decreases ⌈uk m⌉ by 1 and leaves ⌈dk+1 m⌉ unchanged; each execution of K3 decreases ⌈dk m⌉ by 1 and leaves ⌈uk−1 m⌉ unchanged. The algorithm must therefore terminate in a finite number of steps, and everybody must then be on the correct floor because of  6  and  8 .   356  SORTING  5.4.8  When uk = 0 and uk+1 > 0 we have a “disconnected” situation; the elevator must journey up to floor k + 1 in order to rearrange the people up there, even though nobody wants to move from floors ≤ k to floors ≥ k + 1. Without loss of generality, we may assume that un−1 > 0; then every valid elevator schedule must include at least  9   max1,⌈uk m⌉  2   1≤k<n  moves, since we require the elevator to return to floor 1.

[20] How would you sort a multireel file with only two tapes?  *5.4.9. Disks and Drums So far we have considered tapes as the vehicles for external sorting, but more flexible types of mass storage devices are generally available. Although such “bulk memory” or “direct-access storage” units come in many different forms, they may be roughly characterized by the following properties:   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  357  i  Any specified part of the stored information can be accessed quickly. ii  Blocks of consecutive words can be transmitted rapidly between the internal  and external memory.  Magnetic tape satisfies  ii  but not  i , because it takes a long time to get from one end of a tape to the other.  Every external memory unit has idiosyncrasies that ought to be studied carefully before major programs are written for it; but technology changes so rapidly, it is impossible to give a complete discussion here of all the available varieties of hardware. Therefore we shall consider only some typical memory devices that illustrate useful approaches to the sorting problem.  One of the most common types of external memories satisfying  i  and  ii  is a disk device  see Fig. 89 . Data is kept on a number of rapidly rotating circular disks, covered with magnetic material; a comb-like access arm, containing one or more “read write heads” for each disk surface, is used to store and retrieve the information. Each individual surface is divided into concentric rings called tracks, so that an entire track of data passes a read write head every time the disk completes one revolution. The access arm can move in and out, shifting the read write heads from track to track; but this motion takes time. A set of tracks that can be read or written without repositioning the access arm is called a cylinder. For example, Fig. 89 illustrates a disk unit that has just one read write head per surface; the light gray circles show one of the cylinders, consisting of all tracks currently being scanned by the read write heads.  To fix the ideas, let us consider hypothetical MIXTEC disk units, for which  Fig. 89. A disk device.  1 track = 5000 characters  1 cylinder = 20 tracks 1 disk unit = 200 cylinders  Such a disk unit contains 20 million characters, slightly less than the amount of data that can be stored on a single MIXT magnetic tape. On some machines, tracks near the center have fewer characters than tracks near the rim; this tends  Disks  Access arm   358  SORTING  5.4.9  to make the programming much more complicated, and MIXTEC fortunately avoids such problems.  See Section 5.4.6 for a discussion of MIXT tapes. As in that section, we are studying classical techniques by considering machine characteristics that were typical of the early 1970s; modern disks are much bigger and faster.   The amount of time required to read or write on a disk device is essentially  the sum of three quantities:   seek time  the time to move the access arm to the proper cylinder ;   latency time  rotational delay until the read write head reaches the right spot ;   transmission time  rotational delay while the data passes the read write head . On MIXTEC devices the seek time required to go from cylinder i to cylinder j is 2i−j milliseconds. If i and j are randomly selected integers between 1 and 25+ 1 about 60 ms. MIXTEC disks rotate once every 25 ms, so the latency time averages about 12.5 ms. The transmission time for n characters is  n 5000  × 25 ms = 5n µs.  This is about 3 1 3 times as fast as the transmission rate of the MIXT tapes that were used in the examples of Section 5.4.6.  Thus the main differences between MIXTEC disks and MIXT tapes are these:   2002 ≈ 66.7, so the average seek time is  200, the average value of i − j is 2201  3  a  Tapes can only be accessed sequentially. b  Individual disk operations tend to require significantly more overhead  seek  time + latency time compared to stop start time .  c  The disk transmission rate is faster. By using clever merge patterns on tape, we were able to compensate somewhat for disadvantage  a . Our goal now is to think of some clever algorithms for disk sorting that will compensate for disadvantage  b . Overcoming latency time. Let us consider first the problem of minimizing the delays caused by the fact that the disks aren’t always positioned properly when we want to start an I O command. We can’t make the disk spin faster, but we can still apply some tricks that reduce or even eliminate all of the latency time. The addition of more access arms would obviously help, but that would be an expensive hardware modification. Here are some software ideas:    If we read or write several tracks of a cylinder at a time, we avoid the latency time  and the seek time  on all tracks but the first. In general it is often possible to synchronize the computing time with the disk movement in such a way that a sequence of input output instructions can be carried out without latency delays.    Consider the problem of reading half a track of data  Fig. 90 : If the read command begins when the heads are at axis A, there is no latency delay, and the 2 × 25 ms. If the command total time for reading is just the transmission time, 1 begins with the heads at B, we need 1 2 for 4 × 25 ms. The most interesting case occurs when the transmission, totalling 3  4 of a revolution for latency and 1   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  359  Fig. 90. Analysis of the latency time when reading half of a track.  heads are initially at C: With proper hardware and software we need not waste 3 4 of a revolution for latency delay. Reading can begin immediately, into the 2 × 25 ms pause, reading can resume second half of the input buffer; then after a 1 into the first half of the buffer, so that the instruction is completed when axis C is reached again. In a similar manner, we can ensure that the total latency plus transmission time will never exceed the time for one revolution, regardless of the initial position of the disk. The average amount of latency delay is reduced by 2 1− x2  of a revolution, if we are reading this scheme from half a revolution to 1 or writing a given fraction x of a track, for 0 < x ≤ 1. When an entire track is being read or written  x = 1 , this technique eliminates all the latency time. Drums: The no-seek case. Some external memory units, traditionally called drum memories, eliminate the seek time by having one read write head for every track. If the technique of Fig. 90 is employed on such devices, both seek time and latency time reduce to zero, provided that we always read or write a track at a time; this is the ideal situation in which transmission time is the only limiting factor.  Let us consider again the example application of Section 5.4.6, sorting 100,000 records of 100 characters each, with a 100,000-character internal memory. The total amount of data to be sorted fills half of a MIXTEC disk. It is usually impossible to read and write simultaneously on a single disk unit; we shall assume that two disks are available, so that reading and writing can overlap each other. For the moment we shall assume, in fact, that the disks are actually drums, containing 4000 tracks of 5000 characters each, with no seek time required.  What sorting algorithm should be used? The method of merging is a fairly natural choice; other methods of internal sorting do not lend themselves so well to a disk implementation, except for the radix techniques of Section 5.2.5. The considerations of Section 5.4.7 show that radix sorting is usually inferior to merging for general-purpose applications, because the duality theorem of that section applies to disks as well as to tapes. Radix sorting does have a strong advantage, however, when the keys are uniformly distributed and many disks can be used in parallel, because an initial distribution by the most significant digits of the keys will divide the work up into independent subproblems that need no further communication.  See, for example, R. C. Agarwal, SIGMOD Record 25, 2  June 1996 , 240–246.   Half-track of data  C  B  A   360  SORTING  5.4.9  We will concentrate on merge sorting in the following discussion. To begin a merge sort for the stated problem we can use replacement selection, with two 5000-character input buffers and two 5000-character output buffers. In fact, it is possible to reduce this to three 5000-character buffers, if records in the current input buffer are replaced by records that come off the selection tree. That leaves 85,000 characters  850 records  for a selection tree, so one pass over our example data will form about 60 initial runs.  See Eq. 5.4.6– 3 .  This pass takes only about 50 seconds, if we assume that the internal processing time is fast enough to keep up with the input output rate, with one record moving to the output buffer every 500 microseconds. If the input to be sorted appeared on a MIXT tape, instead of a drum, this pass would be slower, governed by the tape speed. With two drums and full-track reading writing, it is not hard to see that the total transmission time for P-way merging is minimized if we let P be as large as possible. Unfortunately we can’t simply do a 60-way merge on all of the initial runs, since there isn’t room for 60 buffers in memory.  A buffer of fewer than 5000 characters would introduce unwanted latency time. Remember that we are still pretending to be living in the 1970s, when internal memory space was significantly limited.  If we do P-way merges, passing all the data from one drum to the other so that reading and writing are overlapped, the number of merge  passes is logP 60, so we may complete the job in two passes if 8 ≤ P ≤ 59.  The smallest such P reduces the amount of internal computing, so we choose P = 8; if 65 initial runs had been formed we would take P = 9. If 82 or more initial runs had been formed, we could take P = 10, but since there is room for only 18 input buffers and 2 output buffers there would be a possibility of hangup during the merge  see Algorithm 5.4.6F ; it may be better in such a case to do two partial passes over a small portion of the data, reducing the number of initial runs to 81 or less.  Under our assumptions, both of the merging passes will take about 50 seconds, so the entire sort in this ideal situation will be completed in just 2.5 minutes  plus a few seconds for bookkeeping, initialization, etc. . This is six times faster than the best six-tape sort considered in Section 5.4.6; the reasons for this speedup are the improved external internal transmission rate  3.5 times faster , the higher order of merge  we can’t do an eight-way tape merge unless we have nine or more tapes , and the fact that the output was left on disk  no final rewind, etc., was necessary . If the initial input and sorted output were required to be on MIXT tapes, with the drums used for merging only, the corresponding sorting time would have been about 8.2 minutes.  If only one drum were available instead of two, the input-output time would take twice as long, since reading and writing must be done separately.  In fact, the input-output operations might take three times as long, since we would be overwriting the initial input data; in such a case it is prudent to follow each write by a “read-back check” operation, lest some of the input data be irretrievably lost, if the hardware does not provide automatic verification of written informa- tion.  But some of this excess time can be recovered because we can use partial pass methods that process some data records more often than others. The two-   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  361  drum case requires all data to be processed an even number or an odd number of times, but the one-drum case can use more general merge patterns.  We observed in Section 5.4.4 that merge patterns can be represented by trees, and that the transmission time corresponding to a merge pattern is proportional to the external path length of its tree. Only certain trees  T-lifo or strongly T-fifo  could be used as efficient tape merging patterns, because some runs get buried in the middle of a tape as the merging proceeds. But on disks or drums, all trees define usable merge patterns if the degrees of their internal nodes are not too large for the available internal memory size.  Therefore we can minimize transmission time by choosing a tree with mini- mum external path length, such as a complete P-ary tree where P is as large as possible. By Eq. 5.4.4– 9 , the external path length of such a tree is equal to  qS − P q − S   P − 1 ,  q =logP S,   1   if there are S external nodes  leaves .  It is particularly easy to design an algorithm that merges according to the complete P-ary tree pattern. See, for example, Fig. 91, which shows the case P = 3, S = 6. First we add dummy runs, if necessary, to make S ≡ 1  modulo P − 1 ; then we combine runs according to a first-in-first-out discipline, at every stage merging the P oldest runs at the front of the queue into a single run that is placed at the rear.  Fig. 91. Complete ternary tree with six leaves, and the corresponding merge pattern.  The complete P-ary tree gives an optimum pattern if all of the initial runs are the same length, but we can often do better if some runs are longer than others. An optimum pattern for this general situation can be constructed without difficulty by using Huffman’s method  exercise 2.3.4.5–10 , which may be stated in merging language as follows: “First add  1 − S  mod  P − 1  dummy runs of length 0. Then repeatedly merge together the P shortest existing runs until only one run is left.” When all initial runs have the same length this method reduces to the FIFO discipline described above.  In our 100,000-record example we can do nine-way merging, since 18 input buffers and two output buffers will fit in memory and Algorithm 5.4.6F will overlap all compute time. The complete 9-ary tree with 60 leaves corresponds to a merging pattern with 1 29 30 passes, if all initial runs have the same length. The total sorting time with one drum, using read-back check after every write,  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0   cid:122   0   cid:125  cid:124   1   cid:123   cid:122    cid:125  cid:124   4   cid:123   cid:122    cid:125  cid:124    cid:123   2  3  5  6  7  8  9   362  SORTING  5.4.9  therefore comes to about 7.4 minutes. A higher value of P may reduce this running time slightly; but the situation is complicated because “reading hangup” might occur when the buffers become too full or too empty. The influence of seek time. Our discussion shows that it is relatively easy to construct optimum merging patterns for drums, because seek time and latency time can be essentially nonexistent. But when disks are used with small buffers we often spend more time seeking information than reading it, so the seek time has a considerable influence on the sorting strategy. Decreasing the order of merge, P, makes it possible to use larger buffers, so fewer seeks are required; this often compensates for the extra transmission time demanded by the smaller value of P.  Seek time depends on the distance traveled by the access arm, and we could try to arrange things so that this distance is minimized. For example, it may be wise to sort the records within cylinders first. However, large-scale merging requires a good deal of jumping around between cylinders  see exercise 2 . Furthermore, the multiprogramming capability of modern operating systems means that users tend to lose control over the position of disk access arms. We are often justified, therefore, in assuming that each disk command involves a “random” seek.  Our goal is to discover a merge pattern that achieves the best balance between seek time and transmission time. For this purpose we need some way to estimate the goodness of any particular tree with respect to a particular hardware configuration. Consider, for example, the tree in Fig. 92; we want to estimate how long it will take to carry out the corresponding merge, so that we can compare this tree to other trees.  In the following discussion we shall make some simple assumptions about disk merging, in order to illustrate some of the general ideas. Let us suppose that  i  it takes 72.5 + 0.005n milliseconds to read or write n characters;  ii  100,000 characters of internal memory are available for working storage;  iii  an average of 0.004 milliseconds of computation time are required to transmit each character from input to output;  iv  there is to be no overlap between reading, writing, or computing; and  v  the buffer size used on output need not be the same as the buffer size used to read the data on the following pass. An analysis of the sorting problem under these simple assumptions will give us some insights when we turn to more complicated situations.  If we do a P-way merge, we can divide the internal working storage into P +1 buffer areas, P for input and one for output, with B = 100000  P +1  characters per buffer. Suppose the files being merged contain a total of L characters; then we will do approximately L B output operations and about the same number of input operations, so the total merging time under our assumptions will be approximately  + 0.005L  + 0.004L =  0.00145P + 0.01545 L   2     2  72.5 L B    milliseconds.   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  363  Fig. 92. A tree whose external path length is 16 and whose degree path length is 52.  In other words, a P-way merge of L characters takes about  αP + β L units of time, for some constants α and β depending on the seek time, latency time, compute time, and memory size. This formula leads to an interesting way to construct good merge patterns for disks. Consider Fig. 92, for example, and assume that all initial runs  represented by square leaf nodes  have length L0. Then the merges at nodes 9 and 10 each take  2α + β  2L0  units of time, the merge at node 11 takes  3α + β  4L0 , and the final merge at node 12 takes  4α + β  8L0 . The total merging time therefore comes to  52α + 16β L0 units. The coefficient “16” here is well-known to us, it is simply the external path length of the tree. The coefficient “52” of α is, however, a new concept, which we may call the degree path length of the tree; it is the sum, taken over all leaf nodes, of the internal-node degrees on the path from the leaf to the root. For example, in Fig. 92 the degree path length is  2 + 4  +  2 + 4  +  3 + 4  +  2 + 3 + 4  +  2 + 3 + 4  +  3 + 4  +  4  +  4   = 52. If T is any tree, let D T   and E T   denote its degree path length and its external path length, respectively. Our analysis may be summarized as follows: Theorem H. If the time required to do a P-way merge on L characters has the form  αP + β L, and if there are S equal-length runs to be merged, the best merge pattern corresponds to a tree T for which αD T  + βE T   is a minimum, over all trees having S leaves.  This theorem was implicitly contained in an unpublished paper that George U. Hubbard presented at the ACM National Conference in 1963.  Let α and β be fixed constants; we shall say a tree is optimal if it has the minimum value of αD T   + βE T   over all trees, T , with the same number of leaves. It is not difficult to see that all subtrees of an optimal tree are optimal, and therefore we can construct optimal trees with n leaves by piecing together optimal trees with < n leaves.  12  10  11  7  8  1  2  3  9  6  4  5   SORTING  364 5.4.9 Theorem K. Let the sequence of numbers Am n  be defined for 1 ≤ m ≤ n by the rules  for 2 ≤ m ≤ n;   3   4   A1 1  = 0; Am n  = min 1≤k≤n m A1 n  = min 2≤m≤n  A1 k  + Am−1 n − k , αmn + βn + Am n ,  for n ≥ 2.   5  Then A1 n  is the minimum value of αD T   + βE T  , over all trees T with n leaves. Proof. Equation  4  implies that Am n  is the minimum value of A1 n1  +··· + A1 nm  taken over all positive integers n1, . . . , nm such that n1 + ··· + nm = n. The result now follows by induction on n.  The recurrence relations  3 ,  4 ,  5  can also be used to construct the optimal trees themselves: Let km n  be a value for which the minimum occurs in the definition of Am n . Then we can construct an optimal tree with n leaves by joining m = k1 n  subtrees at the root; the subtrees are optimal trees with km n , km−1 leaves, respectively.  n − km n  − km−1 n − km n  , . . .  n − km n , km−2  For example, Table 1 illustrates this construction when α = β = 1. A com- pact specification of the corresponding optimal trees appears at the right of the table; the entry “4:9:9” when n = 22 means, for example, that an optimal tree T22 with 22 leaves may be obtained by combining T4, T9, and T9  see Fig. 93 . Optimal trees are not unique; for instance, 5:8:9 would be just as good as 4:9:9.  Fig. 93. An optimum way to merge 22 initial runs of equal length, when α = β in Theorem H. This pattern minimizes the seek time, under the assumptions leading to Eq.  2  in the text.  Our derivation of  2  shows that the relation α ≤ β will hold whenever P + 1 equal buffer areas are used. The limiting case α = β, shown in Table 1 and Fig. 93, occurs when the seek time itself is to be minimized without regard to transmission time.  Returning to our original application, we still haven’t considered how to get the initial runs in the first place; without read write compute overlap, replacement selection loses some of its advantages. Perhaps we should fill the entire internal memory, sort it, and output the results; such input and output   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  365  Table 1  OPTIMAL TREE CHARACTERISTICS Am n , km n  WHEN α = β = 1  m 6      3  2  8  5  4  7  1 n 0,0 1 0,1 6,2 2 6,1 12,3 3 12,1 20,4 4 18,2 30,5 5 0,1 24,3 42,2 6 0,1 6,1 32,3 52,3 7 0,1 6,1 12,1 40,4 62,3 8 6,1 12,1 18,1 50,4 72,3 9 12,1 18,1 24,1 60,5 84,3 10 18,1 24,1 30,1 72,4 11 96,3 24,1 30,1 36,1 82,4 12 108,3 30,1 36,1 42,1 13 121,4 92,4 36,1 42,1 48,1 14 134,4 102,5 42,1 48,1 54,1 15 147,4 114,5 48,1 54,1 60,1 16 160,4 124,7 54,1 60,1 66,2 17 175,4 134,8 60,1 66,1 72,3 18 190,4 144,9 66,1 72,1 80,3 19 205,4 156,9 72,1 78,2 88,3 20 220,4 168,9 78,1 84,3 21 236,5 180,9 96,3 84,1 22 252,3 192,10 164,4 142,4 120,4 104,3 92,3 90,2 23 266,3 204,11 174,5 152,4 130,4 112,3 100,3 24 282,3 216,12 186,5 162,5 140,4 120,4 108,3 96,3 25 296,3 229,12 196,7 174,4 150,5 130,4 116,3 104,3  0,1 0,1 6,1 0,1 6,1 12,1 6,1 12,1 18,1 12,1 18,1 24,1 18,1 24,1 30,2 24,1 30,1 36,3 30,1 36,1 44,3 36,1 42,2 52,3 42,1 48,3 60,4 48,1 56,3 70,4 54,2 64,3 80,4 60,3 72,3 90,4 68,3 80,4 102,4 76,3 112,4 90,4 84,3 122,4 100,4 132,5 110,4 92,3 144,4 120,5 100,4 154,4 132,4 110,4    9  12  10  11  Tree — 1:1 1:1:1 1:1:1:1 1:1:1:1:1  n 1 2 3 4 5 3:3 6 1:3:3 7 2:3:3 8 3:3:3 0,1 9 3:3:4 0,1 6,1 10 3:4:4 0,1 12,1 6,1 11 0,1 4:4:4 18,1 12,1 6,1 12 24,1 18,1 12,1 6,1 3:3:3:4 13 30,1 24,1 18,1 12,1 3:3:4:4 14 36,1 30,1 24,1 18,1 3:4:4:4 15 42,1 36,1 30,1 24,1 4:4:4:4 16 48,1 42,1 36,1 30,1 4:4:4:5 17 54,1 48,1 42,1 36,1 4:4:5:5 18 60,1 54,1 48,1 42,1 4:5:5:5 19 66,1 60,1 54,1 48,1 5:5:5:5 20 72,1 66,1 60,1 54,1 4:4:4:4:5 21 22 78,1 72,1 66,1 60,1 23 84,1 78,1 72,1 66,1 24 90,1 84,1 78,1 72,1 96,1 90,1 84,1 78,1 25  4:9:9 5:9:9 5:9:10 7:9:9  operations can each be done with one seek. Or perhaps we are better off using, say, 20 percent of the memory as a combination input output buffer, and doing replacement selection. This requires five times as many seeks  an extra 60 seconds or so! , but it reduces the number of initial runs from 100 to 64; the reduc- tion would be more dramatic if the input file were pretty much in order already. If we decide not to use replacement selection, the optimum tree for S = 100, α = 0.00145, β = 0.01545 [see  2 ] turns out to be rather prosaic: It is simply a 10-way merge, completed in two passes over the data. Allowing 30 seconds for internal sorting  100 quicksorts, say , the initial distribution pass takes about 2.5 minutes, and the merge passes each take almost 5 minutes, for a total of 12.4 minutes. If we decide to use replacement selection, the optimal tree for S = 64 turns out to be equally uninteresting  two 8-way merge passes ; the initial distribution pass takes about 3.5 minutes, the merge passes each take about 4.5 minutes, and the estimated total time comes to 12.6 minutes. Remember that both of these methods give up virtually all read write compute overlap in order to have larger buffers, reducing seek time. None of these estimated times includes the time that might be necessary for read-back check operations.  In practice the final merge pass tends to be quite different from the others; for example, the output is often expanded and or written onto tape. In such cases the tree pattern should be chosen using a different optimality criterion at the root.   366  SORTING  *A closer look at optimal trees. It is interesting to examine the extreme case β = 0 in Theorems H and K, even though practical situations usually lead to parameters with 0 ≤ α ≤ β. What tree with n leaves has the smallest possible degree path length? Curiously it turns out that three-way merging is best. Theorem L. The degree path length of a tree with n leaves is never less than   3qn + 2 n − 3q ,  3qn + 4 n − 3q ,  f n  =  if 2 · 3q−1 ≤ n ≤ 3q; if 3q ≤ n ≤ 2 · 3q.  Ternary trees Tn defined by the rules  T1 =  ,  T2 =  ,  Tn =  5.4.9   6    7   min 1≤k<n  have the minimum degree path length. Proof. It is important to observe that f n  is a convex function, namely that  f n + 1  − f n  ≥ f n  − f n − 1    8  The relevance of this property is due to the following lemma, which is dual to the result of exercise 2.3.4.5–17.

But the results we have seen for α = β in Table 1 show that the function A1 n  is not always convex. In fact, Table 1 is sufficient to disprove most simple conjectures about optimal trees! We can, however, salvage part of Theorem L in the general case; M. Schlumberger and J. Vuillemin have shown that large orders of merge can always be avoided:   10   T cid:106  n   cid:107  T cid:106  n+1   cid:107  T cid:106  n+2   cid:107   3  3  3   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  367  Theorem M.

Let n1, . . . , nm be positive integers such that n1 +··· + nm = n, A n1  + ··· + A nm  = Am n , and n1 ≤ ··· ≤ nm, and assume that m ≥ d α, β  + 1. Let k be the value that minimizes  12 ; we shall show that  αn m − k  + βn + Am−k n  ≤ αnm + βn + Am n ,  hence the minimum value in  5  is always achieved for some m ≤ d α, β .  By definition, since m ≥ k + 2, we must have  ≤ α n1+···+nk+1  k+1 +β n1+···+nk+1 +A1 n1 +···+A1 nm   Am−k n  ≤ A1 n1+···+nk+1 +A1 nk+2 +···+A1 nm   =α k+1 +β n1+···+nk+1 +Am n  ≤α k+1 +β k+1 n m+Am n ,   12    13   and  13  now follows easily.  Careful inspection of this proof shows that  12  is best possible, in the sense that some optimal trees must have nodes of degree d α, β ; see exercise 13.   The construction in Theorem K needs O N 2  memory cells and O N 2 log N  steps to evaluate Am n  for 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ N; Theorem M shows that only O N  cells and O N 2  steps are needed. Schlumberger and Vuillemin have discovered several more very interesting properties of optimal trees [Acta Informatica 3  1973 , 25–36]. Furthermore the asymptotic value of A1 n  can be worked out as shown in exercise 9. *Another way to allocate buffers. David E. Ferguson [CACM 14  1971 , 476–478] pointed out that seek time can be reduced if we don’t make all buffers the same size. The same idea occurred at about the same time to several other people [S. J. Waters, Comp. J. 14  1971 , 109–112; Ewing S. Walker, Software Age 4  August–September, 1970 , 16–17].  Suppose we are doing a four-way merge on runs of equal length L0, with M characters of memory. If we divide the memory into equal buffers of size B = M 5, we need about L0 B seeks on each input file and 4L0 B seeks for the output, totalling 8L0 B = 40L0 M seeks. But if we use four input buffers of size M 6 and one output buffer of size M 3, we need only about 4×  6L0 M  + 4×  3L0 M  = 36L0 M seeks! The transmission time is the same in both cases, so we haven’t lost anything by the change.  In general, suppose that we want to merge sorted files of lengths L1, . . . , LP  into a sorted file of length  LP +1 = L1 + ··· + LP ,   368  SORTING  5.4.9   15    16   and assume that a buffer of size Bk is being used for the kth file. Thus   14  where M is the total size of available internal memory. The number of seeks will be approximately  B1 + ··· + BP + BP +1 = M,  L1 B1  + ··· + LP BP  + LP +1 BP +1  .  Let’s try to minimize this quantity, subject to condition  14 , assuming for convenience that the Bk’s don’t have to be integers. If we increase Bj by δ and decrease Bk by the same amount, the number of seeks changes by  Lj  Bj + δ  − Lj Bj  + Lk  Bk − δ  − Lk Bk  =  so the allocation can be improved if Lj B2 minimum number of seeks only if  Lk  Bk Bk − δ  − j ̸= Lk B2  Lj  Bj Bj + δ   δ,  k. Therefore we get the      Bk =  B2 Since a minimum does exist it must occur when  L1 B2 1  = ··· = LP B2 P  = LP +1 P +1  .   17  these are the only values of B1, . . . , BP +1 that satisfy both  14  and  16 . Plug- ging  17  into  15  gives a fairly simple formula for the total number of seeks,  1 ≤ k ≤ P + 1;   18  which may be compared with the number  P + 1  L1 +··· + LP +1  M obtained if all buffers are equal in length. By exercise 1.2.3–31, the improvement is   M,  Lk M L1 + ··· +LP +1 ,  L1 + ··· +LP +1 2  2  √  √  Lj −  1≤j<k≤P +1  Lk   M.  Unfortunately formula  18  does not lend itself to an easy determination of optimum merge patterns as in Theorem K  see exercise 14 . The use of chaining. M. A. Goetz [CACM 6  1963 , 245–248] has suggested an interesting way to avoid seek time on output, by linking individual tracks together. His idea requires a fairly fancy set of disk storage management routines, but it applies to many problems besides sorting, and it may therefore be a very worthwhile technique for general-purpose use.  The concept is simple: Instead of allocating tracks sequentially within cyl- inders of the disk, we link them together and maintain lists of available space, one for each cylinder. When it is time to output a track of information, we write it on the current cylinder  wherever the access arm happens to be , unless that cylinder is full. In this way the seek time usually disappears.   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  369  The catch is that we can’t store a link-to-next-track within the track itself, since the necessary information isn’t known at the right time.  We could store a link-to-previous-track and read the file backwards on the next pass, if that were suitable.  A table of link addresses for the tracks of each file can be maintained separately, because it requires comparatively little space. The available space lists can be represented compactly by using bit tables, with 1000 bits specifying the availability or unavailability of 1000 tracks. Forecasting revisited. Algorithm 5.4.6F shows that we can forecast which input buffer of a P-way merge will empty first, by looking at the last keys in each buffer. Therefore we can be reading and computing at the same time. That algorithm uses floating input buffers, not dedicated to a particular file; so the buffers must all be the same size, and the buffer allocation technique above cannot be used. But the restriction to a uniform buffer size is no great loss, since computers now have much larger internal memories than they used to. Nowadays a natural buffer size, such as the capacity of a full disk track, often suggests itself. Let us therefore imagine that the P runs to be merged each consist of a sequence of data blocks, where each block  except possibly the last  contains exactly B records. D. L. Whitlow and A. Sasson developed an interesting algorithm called SyncSort [U.S. Patent 4210961  1980 ], which improves on Algorithm 5.4.6F by needing only three buffers of size B together with a memory pool holding PB records and PB pointers. By contrast, Algorithm 5.4.6F requires 2P input buffers and 2 output buffers, but no pointers.  SyncSort begins by reading the first block of each run and putting these PB records into the memory pool. Each record in the memory pool is linked to its successor in the run it belongs to, except that the final record in each block has no successor as yet. The smallest of the keys in those final records determines the run that will need to replenished first, so we begin to read the second block of that run into the first buffer. Merging begins as soon as that second block has been read; by looking at its final key we can accurately forecast the next relevant block, and we can continue in the same way to prefetch exactly the right blocks to input, just before they are needed.  The three SyncSort buffers are arranged in a circle. As merging proceeds, the computer is processing data in the current buffer, while input is being read into the next buffer and output is being written from the third. The merging algorithm exchanges each record in the current buffer with the next record of output, namely the record in the memory pool that has the smallest key. The selection tree and the successor links are also updated appropriately as we make each exchange. Once the end of the current buffer is reached, we are ready to rotate the buffer circle: The reading buffer becomes current, the writing buffer is used for reading, and we begin to write from the former current buffer.  Many extensions of this basic idea are possible, depending on hardware capabilities. For example, we might use two disks, one for reading and one for writing, so that input and output and merging can all take place simultaneously. Or we might be able to overlap seek time by extending the circle to four or more buffers, as in Fig. 26 of Section 1.4.4, and deviating from the forecast input order.   370  SORTING  5.4.9  Using several disks. Disk devices once were massive both in size and weight, but they became dramatically smaller, lighter, and less expensive during the late 1980s — although they began to hold more data than ever before. Therefore people began to design algorithms for once-unimaginable clusters of 5 or 10 or 50 disk devices or for even larger disk farms.  One easy way to gain speed with additional disks is to use the technique of disk striping for large files. Suppose we have D disk units, numbered 0, 1, . . . , D − 1, and consider a file that consists of L blocks a0 a1 . . . aL−1. Striping this file on D disks means that we put block aj on disk number j mod D; thus, disk 0 holds a0 aD a2D . . . , disk 1 holds a1 aD+1 a2D+1 . . . , etc. Then we can perform D reads or D writes simultaneously on D-block groups a0 a1 . . . aD−1, aD aD+1 . . . a2D−1, . . . , which are called superblocks. The individual blocks of each superblock should be on corresponding cylinders on different disks so that the seek time will be the same on each unit. In essence, we are acting as if we had a single disk unit with blocks and buffers of size DB, but the input and output operations run up to D times faster.  An elegant improvement on superblock striping can be used when we’re doing 2-way merging, or in general whenever we want to match records with equal keys in two files that are in order by keys. Suppose the blocks a0 a1 a2 . . . of the first file are striped on D disks as above, but the blocks b0 b1 b2 . . . of the other file are striped in the reverse direction, with block bj on disk  D − 1− j  mod D. For example, if D = 5 the blocks aj appear respectively on disks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, . . . , while the blocks bj for j ≥ 0 appear on 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 4, 3, . . . . Let αj be the last key of block aj and let βj be the last key of block bj. By examining the α’s and β’s we can forecast the sequence in which we will want to read the data blocks; this sequence might, for example, be  a0b0a1a2b1 a3a4b2a5a6 a7a8b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9b10 . . . .  These blocks appear respectively on disks  0 4 1 2 3 3 4 2 0 1 2 3 1 0 4 3 2 1 0 4  . . .  when D = 5, and if we read them five at a time we will be inputting successively from disks {0, 4, 1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 2, 0, 1}, {2, 3, 1, 0, 4}, {3, 2, 1, 0, 4}, . . . ; there will never be a conflict in which we need to read two blocks from the same disk at the same time! In general, with D disks we can read D at a time without conflict, because the first group will have k blocks a0 . . . ak−1 on disks 0 through k−1 and D − k blocks b0 . . . bD−k−1 on disks D − 1 through k, for some k; then we will be poised to continue in the same way but with disk numbers shifted cyclically by k. This trick is well known to card magicians, who call it the Gilbreath principle; it was invented during the 1960s by Norman Gilbreath [see Martin Gardner, Mathematical Magic Show  New York: Knopf, 1977 , Chapter 7; N. Gilbreath, Genii 52  1989 , 743–744]. We need to know the α’s and β’s, to decide what blocks should be read next, but that information takes up only a small fraction of the space needed by the a’s and b’s, and it can be kept in separate files. Therefore we need fewer buffers to keep the input going at full speed  see exercise 23 .   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  371  Randomized striping. If we want to do P-way merging with D disks when P and D are large, we cannot keep reading the information simultaneously from D disks without conflict unless we have a large number of buffers, because there is no analog of the Gilbreath principle when P > 2. No matter how we allocate the blocks of a file to disks, there will be a chance that we might need to read many blocks into memory before we are ready to use them, because the blocks that we really need might all happen to reside on the same disk.  Suppose, for example, that we want to do 8-way merging on 5 disks, and suppose that the blocks a0a1a2 . . . , b0b1b2 . . . , . . . , h0h1h2 . . . of 8 runs have been striped with aj on disk j mod D, bj on disk  j + 1  mod D, . . . , hj on disk  j + 7  mod D. We might need to access these blocks in the order a0b0 c0d0e0 f0g0h0d1e1 d2e2d3a1f1 b1 g1a2f2e3 d4c1h1b2 g2 a3f3e4d5d6 . . . ;  19  then they appear on the respective disks  0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 4 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 . . . ,  20   so our best bet is to input them as follows: Time 3  Time 1  Time 2  a0b0 c0d0e0  f0g0h0c1d1  e1 e2 b1h1d6  Time 4 d2d3g1 b2 ?  Time 5 ? a1a2g2 ?  Time 9 ? ? ? d5 ?  Time 8 ? ? d4e4 ?  Time 6 ? f1f2a3 ?  Time 7 ? ? e3f3 ?   21  By the time we are able to look at block d5, we need to have read d6 as well as 15 blocks of future data denoted by “?”, because of congestion on disk 3. And we will not yet be done with the seven buffers containing remnants of a3, b2, c1, e4, f3, g2, and h1; so we will need buffer space for at least  16 + 8 + 5 B input records in this particular example.  The simple superblock approach to disk striping would proceed instead to read blocks a0a1a2a3a4 at time 1, b0b1b2b3b4 at time 2, . . . , h0h1h2h3h4 at time 8, then d5d6d7d8d9 at time 9  since d5d6d7d8d9 is the superblock needed next , and so on. Using the SyncSort strategy, it would require buffers for  P + 3 DB records and PDB pointers in memory. The more versatile approach indicated above can be shown to need only about half as much buffer space; but the memory requirement is still approximately proportional to PDB when P and D are large  see exercise 24 .  R. D. Barve, E. F. Grove, and J. S. Vitter [Parallel Computing 23  1997 , 601–631] showed that a slight modification of the independent-block approach leads to an algorithm that keeps the disk input output running at nearly its full speed while needing only O P + D log D  buffer blocks instead of Ω PD . Their technique of randomized striping puts block j of run k on disk  xk + j  mod D, where xk is a random integer selected just before run k is first written. Instead of insisting that D blocks are constantly being input, one from each disk, they introduced a simple mechanism for holding back when there isn’t enough space to keep reading ahead on certain disks, and they proved that their method is asymptotically optimal.   372  SORTING  5.4.9  To do P-way merging on D disks with randomized striping, we can maintain 2D + P + Q − 1 floating input buffers, each holding a block of B records. Input is typically being read into D of these buffers, called active read buffers, while P of the others contain the leading blocks from which records are currently being merged; these are called active merge buffers. The remaining D + Q−1 “scratch buffers” are either empty or they hold prefetched data that will be needed later; Q is a nonnegative parameter that can be increased in order to lessen the chance that reading will be held back on any of the disks.  The blocks of all runs can be arranged into chronological order as in  19 : First we list block 0 of each run, then we list the others by determining the order in which active merge buffers will become empty. As explained above, this order is determined by the final keys in each block, so we can readily forecast which blocks ought to be prefetched first. Let’s consider example  19  again, with P = 8, D = 5, and Q = 4. Now we will have only 2D + P + Q − 1 = 21 input buffer blocks to work with instead of the 29 that were needed above for maximum-speed reading. We will use the offsets  b0  d0  x1 = 3, x2 = 1, x3 = 4, x4 = 1, x5 = 0, x6 = 4, x7 = 2, x8 = 1   22   suggested by the decimal digits of π  for runs a, b, . . . , h; thus the respective disks contain Disk Blocks 0: e0 1: 2: 3: a0 4: if we list their blocks in chronological order. The “random” offsets of  22 , together with sequential striping within each run, will tend to minimize the congestion of any particular chronological sequence. The actual processing now goes like this:  . . . . . . d6 . . . . . . . . .  g0 d1   23   d3a1  d4c1  h1  h0  a3  a2  d2  d5  f2  f3  f1  f0  g2  g1  e2  e1  e3  e4  c0  b1  b2  Time 1 Time 2 Time 3 Time 4 Time 5 Time 6 Time 7  Scratch Waiting for  Active reading  Active merging e0 b0 g0a0c0 − − − − − − − −  − − − − − − − −  a0 a0− − − − − − − b0 c0 e0g0− − − −  d0 f1d0d1d2f0 a2h0e2g1d3 a0b0 c0d0− − − − e0f0g0 d1d2f1− −  h0 a2e1 b1 g1a1 a0b0 c0d0e0f0g0h0 d1 d2e2d3f1g1a2−  e1 a0b0 c0d1e1f0g0h0 d2e2d3a1f1 b1 g1a2   f2 d4f2h1e3g2 e3d4 h1g2− − − −  c1a3f3 b2 e4 a2b1 c0d3e2f2g1h0 c1 a2b1 c1d4e3f2g1h0 h1b2 g2a3f3e4 − −  d5 ? d5d6 ? ?   24   At each unit of time we are waiting for the chronologically first block that is not yet merged and not yet in a scratch buffer; this is one of the blocks that is currently being input to an active read buffer. We assume that the computer is much faster than the disks; thus, all blocks before the one we are waiting for will have already entered the merging process before input is complete. We also   5.4.9  DISKS AND DRUMS  373  assume that sufficient output buffers are available so that merging will not be delayed by the lack of a place to place the output  see exercise 26 . When a round of input is complete, the block we were waiting for is immediately classified as an active merge buffer, and the empty merge buffer it replaces will be used for the next active reading. The other D−1 active read buffers now trade places with the D−1 least important scratch buffers; scratch buffers are ranked by chronological order of their contents. On the next round we will wait for the first unmerged block that isn’t present in the scratch buffers. Any scratch buffers preceding that block in chronological order will become part of the active merge before the next input cycle, but the others — shown in parentheses above — will be carried over and they will remain as scratch buffers on the next round. However, at most Q of the buffers in parentheses can be carried over, because we will need to convert D − 1 scratch buffers to active read status immediately after the input is ready. Any additional scratch buffers are effectively blanked out, as if they hadn’t been read. This blanking-out occurs at Time 4 in  24 : We cannot carry all six of the blocks d2e2d3f1g1a2 over to Time 5, because Q = 4, so we reread g1 and a2. Otherwise the reading operations in this example take place at full speed.  Exercise 29 proves that, given any chronological sequence of runs to be merged, the method of randomized striping will achieve the minimum number of disk reads within a factor of r D, Q + 2 , on the average, where the function r is tabulated in Table 2. For example, if D = 4 and Q = 18, the average time to do a P-way merge on L blocks of data with 4 disks and P + 25 input buffers will be at most the time to read r 4, 20 L D ≈ 1.785L 4 blocks on a single disk. This theoretical upper bound is quite conservative; in practice the performance is even better, very near the optimum time L 4.

When records are long and keys are short, it is very tempting to create a new file consisting simply of the keys together with a serial number specifying their original file location. After sorting this key file, we can replace the keys by the successive numbers 1, 2, . . . ; the new file can then be sorted by original file location and we will have a convenient specification of how to unshuffle the records for the final rearrangement. Schematically, the process   374  SORTING  has the following form:  i  Original file ii  Key file Sorted  ii  iii  iv  Edited  iii  v  Sorted  iv  vi  Edited  i    K1, I1  K2, I2  . . .

N, pN   q1, 1  q2, 2  . . .  qN , N   q1, I1  q2, I2  . . .  qN , IN   5.4.9  long short short short short long  Here pj = k if and only if qk = j. The two sorting processes in  iii  and  v  are comparatively fast  perhaps even internal sorts , since the records aren’t very long. In stage  vi  we have reduced the problem to sorting a file whose keys are simply the numbers {1, 2, . . . , N}; each record now specifies exactly where it is to be moved.  The external rearrangement problem that remains after stage  vi  seems trivial, at first glance; but in fact it is rather difficult, and no really good algorithms  significantly better than sorting  have yet been found. We could obviously do the rearrangement in N steps, moving one record at a time; for large enough N this is better than the N log N of a sorting method. But N is never that large; N is, however, sufficiently large that N seeks are unthinkable. A radix sorting method can be used efficiently on the edited records of  vi , since their keys have a perfectly uniform distribution. On modern computers, the processing time for an eight-way distribution is much faster than the processing time for an eight-way merge; hence a distribution sort is probably the best procedure.  See Section 5.4.7, and see also exercise 19.   On the other hand, it seems wasteful to do a full sort after the keys have already been sorted. One reason the external rearrangement problem is unex- pectedly difficult has been discovered by R. W. Floyd, who found a nontrivial lower bound on the number of seeks required to rearrange records on a disk device [Complexity of Computer Computations  New York: Plenum, 1972 , 105–109]. It is convenient to describe Floyd’s result in terms of the elevator problem of Section 5.4.8; but this time we want to find an elevator schedule that minimizes the number of stops, instead of minimizing the distance traveled. Minimizing the number of stops is not precisely equivalent to finding the minimum-seek rearrangement algorithm, since a stop combines input to the elevator with output from the elevator; but the stop-minimization criterion is close enough to indicate the basic ideas.  F n  =   We shall make use of the “discrete entropy” function  ⌈lg k⌉ + 1 = B n  + n − 1 = n⌈lg n⌉ − 2⌈lg n⌉ + n,   25   1<k≤n  where B n  is the binary insertion function, Eq. 5.3.1– 3 . By Eq. 5.3.1– 34 , F n  is the minimum external path length of a binary tree with n leaves, and  n lg n ≤ F n  ≤ n lg n + 0.0861n.   26    5.4.9  Since F n  is convex and satisfies F n  = n + F⌊n 2⌋ + F⌈n 2⌉, we know  DISKS AND DRUMS  375  by Lemma C above that  F n  ≤ F k  + F n − k  + n,   27  This relation is also evident from the external path length characterization of F; it is the crucial fact we need in the following argument.  for 0 ≤ k ≤ n.  configuration of people in the building is defined to be the sum  As in Section 5.4.8 we shall assume that each floor holds b people, the elevator holds m people, and there are n floors. Let sij be the number of people currently on floor i whose destination is floor j. The togetherness rating of any 1≤i,j≤n F sij . For example, assume that b = m = n = 6 and that the 36 people are initially  scattered among the floors as follows:  ␣␣␣␣␣␣ 123456 123456 123456 123456 123456 123456   28  The elevator is empty, sitting on floor 1; “␣” denotes a vacant position. Each floor contains one person with each possible destination, so all sij are 1 and the togetherness rating is zero. If the elevator now transports six people to floor 2, we have the configuration   29    30   123456  ␣␣␣␣␣␣ 123456 123456 123456 123456 123456  and the togetherness rating becomes 6F 0  + 24F 1  + 6F 2  = 12. Suppose the elevator now carries 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, and 4 to floor 3:  ␣␣␣␣␣␣ 245566 123456 123456 123456 123456  112334  The togetherness rating has jumped to 4F 2  + 2F 3  = 18. When all people have finally been transported to their destinations, the togetherness rating will be 6F 6  = 96.  Floyd observed that the togetherness rating can never increase by more than b+m at each stop, since a set of s equal-destination people joining with a similar set of size s′ improves the rating by F s + s′ − F s − F s′  ≤ s + s′. Therefore we have the following result. Theorem F. Let t be the togetherness rating of an initial configuration of bn people, in terms of the definitions above. The elevator must make at least   F b n − t   b + m   stops in order to bring them all to their destinations.  Translating this result into disk terminology, let there be bn records, with b per block, and suppose the internal memory can hold m records at a time. Every disk read brings one block into memory, every disk write stores one block, and sij is the number of records in block i that belong in block j. If n ≥ b, there are initial configurations in which all the sij are ≤ 1; so t = 0 and at least f b n  b + m  ≈  bn lg b  m block-reading operations are necessary to rearrange   376  SORTING  5.4.9  the records.  The factor lg b makes this lower bound nontrivial when b is large.  Exercise 17 derives a substantially stronger lower bound for the common case that m is substantially larger than b.  2 to 1  EXERCISES 1. [M22] The text explains a method by which the average latency time required to 2 1 − x2  revolutions. This is the read a fraction x of a track is reduced from 1 minimum possible value, when there is one access arm. What is the corresponding minimum average latency time if there are two access arms, 180◦ apart, assuming that only one arm can transmit data at any one time? 2. [M30]  A. G. Konheim.  The purpose of this problem is to investigate how far the access arm of a disk must move while merging files that are allocated “orthogonally” to the cylinders. Suppose there are P files, each containing L blocks of records, and assume that the first block of each file appears on cylinder 1, the second on cylinder 2, etc. The relative order of the last keys in each block governs the access arm motion during the merge, hence we may represent the situation in the following mathematically tractable way: Consider a set of P L ordered pairs   a11, 1   a12, 2    a21, 1   a22, 2   . . . . . .   aP 1, 1   aP 2, 2   ...  ...   a1L, L    a2L, L   . . .   aPL, L   ...

The bin number is the run number. The example above uses replacement selection with only two elements in the selection tree; the same size tree should be used for replacement selection in both  iv  and  vii . Notice that the bin contents are not necessarily in sorted order!  Prove that this method will sort, namely that the replacement selection in  vii  will produce only one run.  This technique reduces the number of bins needed in a conventional keysort by distribution, especially if the input is largely in order already.    cid:120  20. [25] Modern hardware software systems provide programmers with a virtual mem-  ory: Programs are written as if there were a very large internal memory, able to contain all of the data. This memory is divided into pages, only a few of which are in the actual internal memory at any one time; the others are on disks or drums. Programmers need not concern themselves with such details, since the system takes care of everything; new pages are automatically brought into memory when needed.  It would seem that the advent of virtual memory technology makes external sorting methods obsolete, since the job can simply be done using the techniques developed for internal sorting. Discuss this situation; in what ways might a hand-tailored external sorting method be better than the application of a general-purpose paging technique to an internal sorting method?   cid:120  21.

SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY Now that we have nearly reached the end of this enormously long chapter, we had better “sort out” the most important facts that we have studied.  An algorithm for sorting is a procedure that rearranges a file of records so that the keys are in ascending order. This orderly arrangement is useful because it brings equal-key records together, it allows efficient processing of several files that are sorted on the same key, it leads to efficient retrieval algorithms, and it makes computer output look less chaotic.  Internal sorting is used when all of the records fit in the computer’s high speed internal memory. We have studied more than two dozen algorithms for internal sorting, in various degrees of detail; and perhaps we would be happier if we didn’t know so many different approaches to the problem! It was fun to learn all the techniques, but now we must face the horrible prospect of actually deciding which method ought to be used in a given situation.  It would be nice if only one or two of the sorting methods would dominate all of the others, regardless of the application or the computer being used. But in fact, each method has its own peculiar virtues. For example, the bubble sort  Algorithm 5.2.2B  has no apparent redeeming features, since there is always a better way to do what it does; but even this technique, suitably generalized, turns out to be useful for two-tape sorting  see Section 5.4.8 . Thus we find that nearly all of the algorithms deserve to be remembered, since there are some applications in which they turn out to be best.  The following brief survey gives the highlights of the most significant al- gorithms we have encountered for internal sorting. As usual, N stands for the number of records in the given file.  1. Distribution counting, Algorithm 5.2D, is very useful when the keys have a small range. It is stable  doesn’t affect the order of records with equal keys , but requires memory space for counters and for 2N records. A modification that saves N of these record spaces at the cost of stability appears in exercise 5.2–13. 2. Straight insertion, Algorithm 5.2.1S, is the simplest method to program, requires no extra space, and is quite efficient for small N  say N ≤ 25 . For large N it is unbearably slow unless the input is nearly in order.  3. Shellsort, Algorithm 5.2.1D, is also quite easy to program, and uses minimum memory space; and it is reasonably efficient for moderately large N  say N ≤ 1000 .  4. List insertion, Algorithm 5.2.1L, uses the same basic idea as straight insertion, so it is suitable only for small N. Like the other list sorting methods described below, it saves the cost of moving long records by manipulating links; this is particularly advantageous when the records have variable length or are part of other data structures.  5. Address calculation techniques are efficient when the keys have a known  usually uniform  distribution; the principal variants of this approach are mul- tiple list insertion  Program 5.2.1M , and MacLaren’s combined radix-insertion   5.5  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  method  discussed at the close of Section 5.2.5 . The latter can be done with only  N cells of additional memory. A two-pass method that learns a nonuniform  O√  381  distribution is discussed in Theorem 5.2.5T.  6. Merge exchange, Algorithm 5.2.2M  Batcher’s method  and its cousin the bitonic sort  exercise 5.3.4–10  are useful when a large number of comparisons can be made simultaneously.  7. Quicksort, Algorithm 5.2.2Q  Hoare’s method  is probably the most useful general-purpose technique for internal sorting, because it requires very little memory space and its average running time on most computers beats that of its competitors when it is well implemented. It can run very slowly in its worst case, however, so a careful choice of the partitioning elements should be made whenever nonrandom data are likely. Choosing the median of three elements, as suggested in exercise 5.2.2–55, makes the worst-case behavior extremely unlikely and also improves the average running time slightly.  8. Straight selection, Algorithm 5.2.3S, is a simple method especially suitable when special hardware is available to find the smallest element of a list rapidly. 9. Heapsort, Algorithm 5.2.3H, requires minimum memory and is guaran- teed to run pretty fast; its average time and its maximum time are both roughly twice the average running time of quicksort.  10. List merging, Algorithm 5.2.4L, is a list sort that,  is guaranteed to be rather fast even in its worst case; moreover, it is stable with respect to equal keys.  like heapsort,  11. Radix sorting, using Algorithm 5.2.5R, is a list sort especially appropri- ate for keys that are either rather short or that have an unusual lexicographic collating sequence. The method of distribution counting  point 1 above  can also be used, as an alternative to linking; such a procedure requires 2N record spaces, plus a table of counters, but the simple form of its inner loop makes it especially good for ultra-fast, “number-crunching” computers that have look-ahead control. Caution: Radix sorting should not be used for small N!  12. Merge insertion, see Section 5.3.1, is especially suitable for very small values of N, in a “straight-line-coded” routine; for example, it would be the appropriate method in an application that requires the sorting of numerous five- or six-record groups.  13. Hybrid methods, combining one or more of the techniques above, are also possible. For example, merge insertion could be used for sorting short subfiles that arise in quicksort.  14. Finally, an unnamed method appearing in the answer to exercise 5.2.1–3 seems to require the shortest possible sorting program. But its average running time, proportional to N 3, makes it the slowest sorting routine in this book!  Table 1 summarizes the speed and space characteristics of many of these methods, when programmed for MIX. It is important to realize that the figures in this table are only rough indications of the relative sorting times; they apply to one computer only, and the assumptions made about input data are not   Table 1    f o  h t g n e L  e d o c  X I M  ? e l  b a t  A COMPARISON OF INTERNAL SORTING METHODS USING THE MIX COMPUTER  Running Time      Method  Reference S  Space  Average  Maximum N = 16 N = 1000 Notes  N  N + 1  N + ϵ lg N N 1 + ϵ   N 1 + ϵ  2N + 1000ϵ  3.9N 7 6 + 10N lg N + 166N  N + 2ϵ lg N N + 2ϵ lg N N + 68ϵ  4N 2 + 10N 22N + 10010 1.5N 2 + 9.5N  1.25N 2 + 13.25N .0175N 2 + 18N 2.875N lg N 2  5.5N 2 22N 3N 2 cN 4 3 2.5N 2 3.5N 2 4N lg N 2 ≥ 2N 2 ≥ N 2 272N 3.25N 2  Yes 22 Yes 26 Ex. 5.2.1–33 Yes 10 Prog. 5.2.1D No 21 Ex. 5.2.1–33 Yes 19  Comparison counting Ex. 5.2–5 Distribution counting Ex. 5.2–9 Straight insertion Shellsort List insertion 18 N + ϵ N + 100  Multiple list insertion Prog. 5.2.1M No 35 Ex. 5.2.2–12 No Merge exchange Quicksort 63 Prog. 5.2.2Q No Median-of-3 quicksort Ex. 5.2.2–55 No 100 Radix exchange 45 Prog. 5.2.2R No 15 Straight selection Prog. 5.2.3S No Prog. 5.2.3H No Heapsort 30 Prog. 5.2.4L Yes 44 List merge Radix list sort Prog. 5.2.5R Yes 36 N + ϵ N + 200  a: Three-digit keys only. b: Six-digit  that is, three-byte  keys only. c: Output not rearranged; final sequence is specified implicitly by links or counters. d: Increments chosen as in 5.2.1– 11 ; a slightly better sequence appears in exercise 5.2.1–29. e: M = 9, using SRB; for the version with DIV, add 1.60N to the average running time. f: M = 100  the byte size . g: M = 34, since 234 > 1010 > 233. h: The average time is based on an empirical estimate, since the theory is incomplete. i: The average time is based on the assumption of uniformly distributed keys. j: Further refinements, mentioned in the text and exercises accompanying this program, would reduce the running time.  1065 10362 412 567 433 645 939 470 487 1135 853 24.5N ln N 1068 761 14.4N ln N 4250  11.67N ln N − 1.74N 10.63N ln N + 2.12N 14.43N ln N + 23.9N  23.08N ln N + 0.01N 14.43N ln N + 4.92N  2.5N 2 + 3N ln N  32N + 4838  N 1 + ϵ   32N  N N  3992432 32010 1491928 128758 1248615  c a  d, h b, c  e  35246 b, c, f, i 284366 81486 74574 137614 2525287 159714 104716 36838  j h, j b, c, j b, c  g, i, j  3 8 2  S O R T N G  I  5 . 5   5.5  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  383  completely consistent for all programs. Comparative tables such as this have been given by many authors, with no two people reaching the same conclusions. On the other hand, the timings do give at least an indication of the kind of speed to be expected from each algorithm, when sorting a rather small array of one-word records, since MIX is a fairly typical computer.  The “space” column in Table 1 gives some information about the amount of auxiliary memory used by each program, in units of record length. Here ϵ denotes the fraction of a record needed for one link field; thus, for example, N 1 + ϵ  means that the method requires space for N records plus N link fields. The asymptotic average and maximum times appearing in Table 1 give only the leading terms that dominate for large N, assuming random input; c denotes an unspecified constant. These formulas can often be misleading, so actual total running times have also been listed, for sample runs of the program on two particular sequences of input data. The case N = 16 refers to the sixteen keys that appear in so many of the examples of Section 5.2; and the case N = 1000 refers to the sequence K1, K2, . . . , K1000 defined by  K1001 = 0;  Kn−1 =  3141592621Kn + 2113148651  mod 1010.  A MIX program of reasonably high quality has been used to represent each algo- rithm in the table, often incorporating improvements that have been suggested in the exercises. The byte size for these runs was 100.  External sorting techniques are different from internal sorting, because they must use comparatively primitive data structures, and because there is a great emphasis on minimizing their input output time. Section 5.4.6 summarizes the interesting methods that have been developed for tape merging, and Section 5.4.9 discusses the use of disks and drums.  Of course, sorting isn’t the whole story. While studying all of these sorting techniques, we have learned a good deal about how to handle data structures, how to deal with external memories, and how to analyze algorithms; and perhaps we have even learned a little about how to discover new algorithms. Early developments. A search for the origin of today’s sorting techniques takes us back to the nineteenth century, when the first machines for sorting were invented. The United States conducts a census of all its citizens every ten years, and by 1880 the problem of processing the voluminous census data was becoming very acute; in fact, the total number of single  as opposed to married  people was never tabulated that year, although the necessary information had been gathered. Herman Hollerith, a 20-year-old employee of the Census Bureau, devised an ingenious electric tabulating machine to meet the need for better statistics-gathering, and about 100 of his machines were successfully used to tabulate the 1890 census rolls.  Figure 94 shows Hollerith’s original battery-driven apparatus; of chief inter- est to us is the “sorting box” at the right, which has been opened to show half of the 26 inner compartments. The operator would insert a 6 5 4′′ punched card into the “press” and lower the handle; this caused spring-actuated pins in the  8′′ × 3 1   384  SORTING  5.5  upper plate to make contact with pools of mercury in the lower plate, wherever a hole was punched in the card. The corresponding completed circuits would cause associated dials on the panel to advance by one unit; and furthermore, one of the 26 lids of the sorting box would pop open. At this point the operator would reopen the press, put the card into the open compartment, and close the lid. One man reportedly ran 19071 cards through this machine in a single 6 1 2- hour working day, an average of about 49 cards per minute!  A typical operator would work at about one-third this speed.

Population continued its inexorable growth, and the original tabulator- sorters were not fast enough to handle the 1900 census; so Hollerith devised another machine to stave off another data processing crisis. His new device  patented in 1901 and 1904  had an automatic card feed, and in fact it looked essentially like modern card sorters. The story of Hollerith’s early machines has been told in interesting detail by Leon E. Truesdell, The Development of Punch Card Tabulation  Washington: U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1965 ; see also the contemporary accounts in Columbia College School of Mines Quarterly 10  1889 , 238–255; J. Franklin Inst. 129  1890 , 300–306; The Electrical Engineer 12  November 11, 1891 , 521–530; J. Amer. Statistical Assn. 2  1891 , 330– 341, 4  1895 , 365; J.

Hollerith and   5.5  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  385  another former Census Bureau employee, James Powers, went on to found rival companies that eventually became part of IBM and Remington Rand corpora- tions, respectively.  Hollerith’s sorting machine is, of course, the basis for radix sorting methods now used in digital computers. His patent mentions that two-column numerical items are to be sorted “separately for each column,” but he didn’t say whether the units or the tens columns should be considered first. Patent number 518240 by John K. Gore in 1894, which described another early machine for sorting cards, suggested starting with the tens column. The nonobvious trick of using the units column first was presumably discovered by some anonymous machine operator and passed on to others  see Section 5.2.5 ; it appears in the earliest extant IBM sorter manual  1936 . The first known mention of this right-to-left technique is in a book by Robert Feindler, Das Hollerith-Lochkarten-Verfahren  Berlin: Reimar Hobbing, 1929 , 126–130; it was also mentioned at about the same time in an article by L. J. Comrie, Transactions of the Office Machinery Users’ Association  London: 1929–1930 , 25–37. Incidentally, Comrie was the first person to make the important observation that tabulating machines could fruitfully be employed in scientific calculations, even though they were originally designed for statistical and accounting applications. His article is especially interesting because it gives a detailed description of the tabulating equipment available in England in 1930. Sorting machines at that time processed 360 to 400 cards per minute, and could be rented for $9 per month.  The idea of merging goes back to another card-walloping machine, the collator, which was a much later invention  1936 . With its two feeding stations, it could merge two sorted decks of cards into one, in only one pass; the technique for doing this was clearly explained in the first IBM collator manual  April 1939 . [See Ralph E. Page, U.S. Patent 2359670  1944 .]  Then computers arrived on the scene, and sorting was intimately involved in this development; in fact, there is evidence that a sorting routine was the first program ever written for a stored-program computer. The designers of EDVAC were especially interested in sorting, because it epitomized the potential nonnumerical applications of computers; they realized that a satisfactory order code should not only be capable of expressing programs for the solution of differ- ence equations, it must also have enough flexibility to handle the combinatorial “decision-making” aspects of algorithms. John von Neumann therefore prepared programs for internal merge sorting in 1945, in order to test the adequacy of some instruction codes he was proposing for the EDVAC computer. The existence of efficient special-purpose sorting machines provided a natural standard by which the merits of his proposed computer organization could be evaluated. Details of this interesting development have been described in an article by D. E. Knuth, Computing Surveys 2  1970 , 247–260; see also von Neumann’s Collected Works 5  New York: Macmillan, 1963 , 196–214, for the final polished form of his original sorting programs.  In Germany, K. Zuse independently constructed a program for straight inser- tion sorting in 1945, as one of the simplest examples of linear list operations in his   386  SORTING  5.5  “Plankalkül” language.  This pioneering work remained unpublished for nearly 30 years; see Berichte der Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung 63  Bonn: 1972 , part 4, 84–85.   The limited internal memory size planned for early computers made it natural to think of external sorting as well as internal sorting, and a “Progress Report on the EDVAC” prepared by J. P. Eckert and J. W. Mauchly of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering  30 September 1945  pointed out that a computer augmented with magnetic wire or tape devices could simulate the operations of card equipment, achieving a faster sorting speed. This progress report described balanced two-way radix sorting, and balanced two-way merging  called “collating” , using four magnetic wire or tape units, reading or writing “at least 5000 pulses per second.”  John Mauchly lectured on “Sorting and Collating” at the special session on computing presented at the Moore School in 1946, and the notes of his lecture constitute the first published discussion of computer sorting [Theory and Techniques for the Design of Electronic Digital Computers, edited by G. W. Patterson, 3  1946 , 22.1–22.20]. Mauchly began his presentation with an inter- esting remark: “To ask that a single machine combine the abilities to compute and to sort might seem like asking that a single device be able to perform both as a can opener and a fountain pen.” Then he observed that machines capable of carrying out sophisticated mathematical procedures must also have the ability to sort and classify data, and he showed that sorting may even be useful in connection with numerical calculations. He described straight insertion and binary insertion, observing that the former method uses about N 2 4 comparisons on the average, while the latter never needs more than about N lg N. Yet binary insertion requires a rather complex data structure, and he went on to show that two-way merging achieves the same low number of comparisons using only sequential accessing of lists. The last half of his lecture notes were devoted to a discussion of partial-pass radix sorting methods that simulate digital card sorting on four tapes, using fewer than four passes per digit  see Section 5.4.7 .  Shortly afterwards, Eckert and Mauchly started a company that produced some of the earliest electronic computers, the BINAC  for military applications  and the UNIVAC  for commercial applications . Again the U.S. Census Bureau played a part in this development, receiving the first UNIVAC. At this time it was not at all clear that computers would be economically profitable; computing machines could sort faster than card equipment, but they cost more. Therefore the UNIVAC programmers, led by Frances E. Snyder, put considerable effort into the design of high-speed external sorting routines, and their preliminary programs also influenced the hardware design. According to their estimates, 100 million 10-word records could be sorted on UNIVAC in 9000 hours, or 375 days. UNIVAC I, officially dedicated in July 1951, had an internal memory of 1000 12-character  72-bit  words. It was designed to read and write 60-word blocks on tapes, at a rate of 500 words per second; reading could be either forward or backward, and simultaneous reading, writing, and computing was possible. In 1948, Snyder devised an interesting way to do two-way merging with perfect   5.5  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  387  overlap of reading, writing, and computing, using six input buffers: Let there be one “current buffer” and two “auxiliary buffers” for each input file; it is possible to merge in such a way that, whenever it is time to output one block, the two current input buffers contain a total of exactly one block’s worth of unprocessed records. Therefore exactly one input buffer becomes empty while each output block is being formed, and we can arrange to have three of the four auxiliary buffers full at all times while we are reading into the other. This method is slightly faster than the forecasting method of Algorithm 5.4.6F, since it is not necessary to inspect the result of one input before initiating the next. [See Collation Methods for the UNIVAC System  Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corp., 1950 , 2 volumes.]  The culmination of this work was a sort generator program, which was the first major software routine ever developed for automatic programming. The user would specify the record size, the positions of up to five keys in partial fields of each record, and the sentinel keys that mark file’s end; then the sort generator would produce a copyrighted sorting program for one-reel files. The first pass of this program was an internal sort of 60-word blocks, using comparison count- ing  Algorithm 5.2C ; then came a number of balanced two-way merge passes, reading backwards and avoiding tape interlock as described above. [See “Master Generating Routine for 2-way Sorting”  Eckert–Mauchly Division of Remington Rand, 1952 ; the first draft of this report was entitled “Master Prefabrication Routine for 2-way Collation.” See also Frances E. [Snyder] Holberton, Sympo- sium on Automatic Programming  Office of Naval Research, 1954 , 34–39.]  By 1952, many approaches to internal sorting were well known in the pro- gramming folklore, but comparatively little theory had been developed. Daniel Goldenberg [“Time analyses of various methods of sorting data,” Digital Compu- ter Laboratory memo M-1680  Mass. Inst. of Tech., 17 October 1952 ] coded five different methods for the Whirlwind computer, and made best-case and worst- case analyses of each program. When sorting one hundred 15-bit words on an 8-bit key, he found that the fastest method was to use a 256-word table, storing each record into a unique position corresponding to its key, then compressing the table. But this technique had an obvious disadvantage, since it would eliminate a record whenever a subsequent one had the same key. The other four methods he analyzed were ranked as follows: Straight two-way merging beat radix-2 sorting beat straight selection beat bubble sort.  Goldenberg’s results were extended by Harold H. Seward in his 1954 Master’s thesis [“Information sorting in the application of electronic digital computers to business operations,” Digital Computer Lab. report R-232  Mass. Inst. of Tech., 24 May 1954; 60 pages ]. Seward introduced the ideas of distribution counting and replacement selection; he showed that the first run in a random permutation has an average length of e−1; and he analyzed external sorting as well as internal sorting, on various types of bulk memories as well as tapes.  An even more noteworthy thesis — a Ph.D. thesis in fact — was written by Howard B. Demuth in 1956 [“Electronic Data Sorting”  Stanford University, October 1956 , 92 pages; IEEE Trans. C-34  1985 , 296–310]. This work helped   388  SORTING  5.5  to lay the foundations of computational complexity theory. It considered three abstract models of the sorting problem, using cyclic, linear, and random-access memories; and optimal or near-optimal methods were developed for each model.  See exercise 5.3.4–68.  Although no practical consequences flowed immediately from Demuth’s thesis, it established important ideas about how to link theory with practice.  Thus the history of sorting has been closely associated with many “firsts” in computing: the first data-processing machines, the first stored programs, the first software, the first buffering methods, the first work on algorithmic analysis and computational complexity.  None of the computer-related documents mentioned so far actually appeared in the “open literature”; in fact, most of the early history of computing appears in comparatively inaccessible reports, because comparatively few people were involved with computers at the time. Literature about sorting finally broke into print in 1955–1956, in the form of three major survey articles.  The first paper was prepared by J. C. Hosken [Proc. Eastern Joint Computer Conference 8  1955 , 39–55]. He began with an astute observation: “To lower costs per unit of output, people usually increase the size of their operations. But under these conditions, the unit cost of sorting, instead of falling, rises.” Hosken surveyed all the available special-purpose equipment then being marketed, as well as the methods of sorting on computers. His bibliography of 54 items was based mostly on manufacturers’ brochures.  The comprehensive paper “Sorting on Electronic Computer Systems” by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 134–168] was a major milestone in the devel- opment of sorting. Although numerous techniques have been developed since 1956, this paper is still remarkably up-to-date in many respects. Friend gave careful descriptions of quite a few internal and external sorting algorithms, and he paid special attention to buffering techniques and the characteristics of magnetic tape units. He introduced some new methods  for example, tree selection, amphisbaenic sorting, and forecasting , and developed some of the mathematical properties of the older methods.  The third survey of sorting to appear about this time was prepared by D. W. Davies [Proc. Inst. Elect. Engineers 103B, Supplement 1  1956 , 87–93]. In the following years several other notable surveys were published, by D. A. Bell [Comp. J. 1  1958 , 71–77]; A. S. Douglas [Comp. J. 2  1959 , 1–9]; D. D. Mc- Cracken, H. Weiss, and T. Lee [Programming Business Computers  New York: Wiley, 1959 , Chapter 15, pages 298–332]; I. Flores [JACM 8  1961 , 41–80]; K. E. Iverson [A Programming Language  New York: Wiley, 1962 , Chapter 6, 176–245]; C. C. Gotlieb [CACM 6  1963 , 194–201]; T. N. Hibbard [CACM 6  1963 , 206–213]; M. A. Goetz [Digital Computer User’s Handbook, edited by M. Klerer and G. A. Korn  New York: McGraw–Hill, 1967 , Chapter 1.10, pages 1.292–1.320]. A symposium on sorting was sponsored by ACM in November 1962; most of the papers presented at that symposium were published in the May 1963 issue of CACM, and they constitute a good representation of the state of the art at that time. C. C. Gotlieb’s survey of contemporary sort generators,   5.5  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  389  T. N. Hibbard’s survey of minimal storage internal sorting, and G. U. Hubbard’s early exploration of disk file sorting are particularly noteworthy articles in this collection.  New sorting methods were being discovered throughout this period: Address calculation  1956 , merge insertion  1959 , radix exchange  1959 , cascade merge  1959 , shellsort  1959 , polyphase merge  1960 , tree insertion  1960 , oscillating sort  1962 , Hoare’s quicksort  1962 , Williams’s heapsort  1964 , Batcher’s merge exchange  1964 . The history of each individual algorithm has been traced in the particular section of this chapter where that method is described. The late 1960s saw an intensive development of the corresponding theory.  A complete bibliography of all papers on sorting examined by the author as this chapter was first being written, compiled with the help of R. L. Rivest, appeared in Computing Reviews 13  1972 , 283–289. Later developments. Dozens of sorting algorithms have been invented since 1970, although nearly all of them are variations on earlier themes. Multikey quicksort, which is discussed in the answer to exercise 5.2.2–30, is an excellent example of such more recent methods.  Another trend, primarily of theoretical interest so far, has been to study sorting schemes that are adaptive, in the sense that they are guaranteed to run faster when the input is already pretty much in order according to various criteria. See, for example, H. Mannila, IEEE Transactions C-34  1985 , 318– 325; V. Estivill-Castro and D. Wood, Computing Surveys 24  1992 , 441–476; C. Levcopoulos and O. Petersson, Journal of Algorithms 14  1993 , 395–413; A. Moffat, G. Eddy, and O. Petersson, Software Practice & Experience 26  1996 , 781–797.  Changes in computer hardware have prompted many interesting studies of the efficiency of sorting algorithms when the cost criteria change; see, for example, the discussion of virtual memory in exercise 5.4.9–20. The effect of hardware caches on internal sorting has been studied by A. LaMarca and R. E. Ladner, J. Algorithms 31  1999 , 66–104. One of their conclusions is that step Q9 of Algorithm 5.2.2Q is a bad idea on modern machines  although it worked well on traditional computers like MIX : Instead of finishing quicksort with a straight insertion sort, it is now better to sort the short subfiles earlier, while their keys are still in the cache.  What is the current state of the art for sorting large amounts of data? One popular benchmark since 1985 has been the task of sorting one million 100- character records that have uniformly random 10-character keys. The input and output are supposed to reside on disk, and the objective is to minimize the total elapsed time, including the time it takes to launch the program. R. C. Agarwal [SIGMOD Record 25, 2  June 1996 , 240–246] used a desktop RISC computer, the IBM RS 6000 model 39H, to implement radix sorting with files that were striped on 8 disk units, and he finished this task in 5.1 seconds. Input output was the main bottleneck; indeed, the processor needed only 0.6 seconds to control the actual sorting! Even faster times have been achieved when several processors are   390  SORTING  5.5  available: A network of 32 UltraSPARC I workstations, each with two internal disks, can sort a million records in 2.41 seconds using a hybrid method called NOW-Sort [A. C. Arpaci-Dusseau, R. H. Arpaci-Dusseau, D. E. Culler, J. M. Hellerstein, and D. A. Patterson, SIGMOD Record 26, 2  June 1997 , 243–254]. Such advances mean that the million-record benchmark has become mostly a test of startup and shutdown time; larger data sets are needed to give more meaningful results. For example, the present world record for terabyte sorting — 1010 records of 100 characters each — is 2.5 hours, achieved in September 1997 on a Silicon Graphics Origin2000 system with 32 processors, 8 gigabytes of internal memory, and 559 disks of 4 gigabytes each. This record was set by a commercially available sorting routine called NsortTM, developed by C. Nyberg, C. Koester, and J. Gray using methods that have not yet been published.  Perhaps even the terabyte benchmark will be considered too small some day. The best current candidate for a benchmark that will live forever is MinuteSort: How many 100-character records can be sorted in 60 seconds? As this book went to press, the current record holder for this task was NOW-Sort; 95 work- stations needed only 59.21 seconds to put 90.25 million records into order, on 30 March 1997. But present-day methods are not yet pushing up against any truly fundamental limitations on speed.  In summary, the problem of efficient sorting remains just as fascinating today  as it ever was.  EXERCISES 1. [05] Summarize the contents of this chapter by stating a generalization of Theo- rem 5.4.6A. 2. [20] Based on the information in Table 1, what is the best list-sorting method for six-digit keys, for use on the MIX computer? 3. [37]  Stable sorting in minimum storage.  A sorting algorithm is said to require minimum storage if it uses only O  log N 2  bits of memory space for its variables besides the space needed to store the N records. The algorithm must be general in the sense that it works for all N, not just for a particular value of N, assuming that a sufficient amount of random access memory has been made available whenever the algorithm is actually called upon to sort.  Many of the sorting methods we have studied violate this minimum-storage re- quirement; in particular, the use of N link fields is forbidden. Quicksort  Algorithm 5.2.2Q  satisfies the minimum-storage requirement, but its worst case running time is proportional to N 2. Heapsort  Algorithm 5.2.3H  is the only O N log N  algorithm we have studied that uses minimum storage, although another such algorithm could be formulated using the idea of exercise 5.2.4–18.  The fastest general algorithm we have considered that sorts keys in a stable manner is the list merge sort  Algorithm 5.2.4L , but it does not use minimum storage. In fact, the only stable minimum-storage sorting algorithms we have seen are Ω N 2  methods  straight insertion, bubble sorting, and a variant of straight selection .  Design a stable minimum-storage sorting algorithm that needs only O N log N 2  units of time in its worst case. [Hint: It is possible to do stable minimum-storage merg- ing — namely, sorting when there are at most two runs — in O N log N  units of time.]   5.5   cid:120  4. [28] A sorting algorithm is called parsimonious if it makes decisions entirely by  SUMMARY, HISTORY, AND BIBLIOGRAPHY  comparing keys, and if it never makes a comparison whose outcome could have been predicted from the results of previous comparisons. Which of the methods listed in Table 1 are parsimonious? 5. [46] It is much more difficult to sort nonrandom data with numerous equal keys than to sort uniformly random data. Devise a sorting benchmark that  i  is interesting now and will probably be interesting 100 years from now;  ii  does not involve uniformly random keys; and  iii  does not use data sets that change with time.  391  I shall have accomplished my purpose if I have sorted and put in logical order the gist of the great volume of material which has been generated about sorting over the past few years. — J. C. HOSKEN  1955    CHAPTER SIX  SEARCHING  Let’s look at the record. — AL SMITH  1928   This chapter might have been given the more pretentious title “Storage and Retrieval of Information”; on the other hand, it might simply have been called “Table Look-Up.” We are concerned with the process of collecting information in a computer’s memory, in such a way that the information can subsequently be recovered as quickly as possible. Sometimes we are confronted with more data than we can really use, and it may be wisest to forget and to destroy most of it; but at other times it is important to retain and organize the given facts in such a way that fast retrieval is possible.  Most of this chapter is devoted to the study of a very simple search problem: how to find the data that has been stored with a given identification. For example, in a numerical application we might want to find f x , given x and a table of the values of f; in a nonnumerical application, we might want to find the English translation of a given Russian word.  In general, we shall suppose that a set of N records has been stored, and the problem is to locate the appropriate one. As in the case of sorting, we assume that each record includes a special field called its key; this terminology is especially appropriate, because many people spend a great deal of time every day searching for their keys. We generally require the N keys to be distinct, so that each key uniquely identifies its record. The collection of all records is called a table or file, where the word “table” is usually used to indicate a small file, and “file” is usually used to indicate a large table. A large file or a group of files is frequently called a database.  Algorithms for searching are presented with a so-called argument, K, and the problem is to find which record has K as its key. After the search is complete, two possibilities can arise: Either the search was successful, having located the unique record containing K; or it was unsuccessful, having determined that K is nowhere to be found. After an unsuccessful search it is sometime desirable to enter a new record, containing K, into the table; a method that does this is called a search-and-insertion algorithm. Some hardware devices known as associative memories solve the search problem automatically, in a way that might resemble the functioning of a human brain; but we shall study techniques for searching on a conventional general-purpose digital computer.  Although the goal of searching is to find the information stored in the record associated with K, the algorithms in this chapter generally ignore everything but  392   6  SEARCHING  393  the keys themselves. In practice we can find the associated data once we have located K; for example, if K appears in location TABLE + i, the associated data  or a pointer to it  might be in location TABLE + i + 1, or in DATA + i, etc. It is therefore convenient to gloss over the details of what should be done after K has been successfully found.  Searching is the most time-consuming part of many programs, and the substitution of a good search method for a bad one often leads to a substantial increase in speed. In fact we can often arrange the data or the data structure so that searching is eliminated entirely, by ensuring that we always know just where to find the information we need. Linked memory is a common way to achieve this; for example, a doubly linked list makes it unnecessary to search for the predecessor or successor of a given item. Another way to avoid searching occurs if we are allowed to choose the keys freely, since we might as well let them be the numbers {1, 2, . . . , N}; then the record containing K can simply be placed in location TABLE + K. Both of these techniques were used to elimi- nate searching from the topological sorting algorithm discussed in Section 2.2.3. However, searches would have been necessary if the objects in the topological sorting algorithm had been given symbolic names instead of numbers. Efficient algorithms for searching turn out to be quite important in practice.  Search methods can be classified in several ways. We might divide them into internal versus external searching, just as we divided the sorting algorithms of Chapter 5 into internal versus external sorting. Or we might divide search methods into static versus dynamic searching, where “static” means that the contents of the table are essentially unchanging  so that it is important to min- imize the search time without regard for the time required to set up the table , and “dynamic” means that the table is subject to frequent insertions and perhaps also deletions. A third possible scheme is to classify search methods according to whether they are based on comparisons between keys or on digital properties of the keys, analogous to the distinction between sorting by comparison and sorting by distribution. Finally we might divide searching into those methods that use the actual keys and those that work with transformed keys.  The organization of this chapter is essentially a combination of the latter two modes of classification. Section 6.1 considers “brute force” sequential methods of search, then Section 6.2 discusses the improvements that can be made based on comparisons between keys, using alphabetic or numeric order to govern the deci- sions. Section 6.3 treats digital searching, and Section 6.4 discusses an important class of methods called hashing techniques, based on arithmetic transformations of the actual keys. Each of these sections treats both internal and external searching, in both the static and the dynamic case; and each section points out the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various algorithms.  Searching and sorting are often closely related to each other. For example, consider the following problem: Given two sets of numbers, A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} and B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn}, determine whether or not A ⊆ B. Three solutions suggest themselves:   394  SEARCHING  6  1. Compare each ai sequentially with the bj’s until finding a match. 2. Sort the a’s and b’s, then make one sequential pass through both files,  checking the appropriate condition.  3. Enter the bj’s in a table, then search for each of the ai.  Each of these solutions is attractive for a different range of values of m and n. Solution 1 will take roughly c1mn units of time, for some constant c1, and solution 2 will take about c2 m lg m+ n lg n  units, for some  larger  constant c2. With a suitable hashing method, solution 3 will take roughly c3m + c4n units of time, for some  still larger  constants c3 and c4. It follows that solution 1 is good for very small m and n, but solution 2 soon becomes better as m and n grow larger. Eventually solution 3 becomes preferable, until n exceeds the internal memory size; then solution 2 is usually again superior until n gets much larger still. Thus we have a situation where sorting is sometimes a good substitute for searching, and searching is sometimes a good substitute for sorting.  More complicated search problems can often be reduced to the simpler case considered here. For example, suppose that the keys are words that might be slightly misspelled; we might want to find the correct record in spite of this error. If we make two copies of the file, one in which the keys are in normal lexicographic order and another in which they are ordered from right to left  as if the words were spelled backwards , a misspelled search argument will probably agree up to half or more of its length with an entry in one of these two files. The search methods of Sections 6.2 and 6.3 can therefore be adapted to find the key that was probably intended.  A related problem has received considerable attention in connection with airline reservation systems, and in other applications involving people’s names when there is a good chance that the name will be misspelled due to poor handwriting or voice transmission. The goal is to transform the argument into some code that tends to bring together all variants of the same name. The following contemporary form of the “Soundex” method, a technique that was originally developed by Margaret K. Odell and Robert C. Russell [see U.S. Patents 1261167  1918 , 1435663  1922 ], has often been used for encoding surnames: 1. Retain the first letter of the name, and drop all occurrences of a, e, h, i, o,  u, w, y in other positions.  2. Assign the following numbers to the remaining letters after the first:  b, f, p, v → 1 c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2 d, t → 3  l → 4 m, n → 5 r → 6  3. If two or more letters with the same code were adjacent in the original name  before step 1 , or adjacent except for intervening h’s and w’s, omit all but the first.  4. Convert to the form “letter, digit, digit, digit” by adding trailing zeros  if there are less than three digits , or by dropping rightmost digits  if there are more than three .   6  SEARCHING  395  For example, the names Euler, Gauss, Hilbert, Knuth, Lloyd, Lukasiewicz, and Wachs have the respective codes E460, G200, H416, K530, L300, L222, W200. Of course this system will bring together names that are somewhat different, as well as names that are similar; the same seven codes would be obtained for Ellery, Ghosh, Heilbronn, Kant, Liddy, Lissajous, and Waugh. And on the other hand a few related names like Rogers and Rodgers, or Sinclair and St. Clair, or Tchebysheff and Chebyshev, remain separate. But by and large the Soundex code greatly increases the chance of finding a name in one of its disguises. [For further information, see C. P. Bourne and D. F. Ford, JACM 8  1961 , 538– 552; Leon Davidson, CACM 5  1962 , 169–171; Federal Population Censuses 1790–1890  Washington, D.C.: National Archives, 1971 , 90.]  When using a scheme like Soundex, we need not give up the assumption that all keys are distinct; we can make lists of all records with equivalent codes, treating each list as a unit.  Large databases tend to make the retrieval process more complex, since people often want to consider many different fields of each record as potential keys, with the ability to locate items when only part of the key information is specified. For example, given a large file about stage performers, a producer might wish to find all unemployed actresses between 25 and 30 with dancing talent and a French accent; given a large file of baseball statistics, a sportswriter may wish to determine the total number of runs scored by the Chicago White Sox in 1964, during the seventh inning of night games, against left-handed pitchers. Given a large file of data about anything, people like to ask arbitrarily complicated questions. Indeed, we might consider an entire library as a database, and a searcher may want to find everything that has been published about information retrieval. An introduction to the techniques for such secondary key  multi-attribute  retrieval problems appears below in Section 6.5.  Before entering into a detailed study of searching, it may be helpful to put things in historical perspective. During the pre-computer era, many books of logarithm tables, trigonometry tables, etc., were compiled, so that mathematical calculations could be replaced by searching. Eventually these tables were trans- ferred to punched cards, and used for scientific problems in connection with collators, sorters, and duplicating punch machines. But when stored-program computers were introduced, it soon became apparent that it was now cheaper to recompute log x or cos x each time, instead of looking up the answer in a table. Although the problem of sorting received considerable attention already in the earliest days of computers, comparatively little was done about algorithms for searching. With small internal memories, and with nothing but sequential media like tapes for storing large files, searching was either trivially easy or almost impossible.  But the development of larger and larger random-access memories during the 1950s eventually led to the recognition that searching was an interesting problem in its own right. After years of complaining about the limited amounts of space in the early machines, programmers were suddenly confronted with larger amounts of memory than they knew how to use efficiently.   396  SEARCHING  6  The first surveys of the searching problem were published by A. I. Dumey, Computers & Automation 5, 12  December 1956 , 6–9; W. W. Peterson, IBM J. Research & Development 1  1957 , 130–146; A. D. Booth, Information and Control 1  1958 , 159–164; A. S. Douglas, Comp. J. 2  1959 , 1–9. More extensive treatments were given later by Kenneth E. Iverson, A Programming Language  New York: Wiley, 1962 , 133–158, and by Werner Buchholz, IBM Systems J. 2  1963 , 86–111.  During the early 1960s, a number of interesting new search procedures based on tree structures were introduced, as we shall see; and research about searching is still actively continuing at the present time.  6.1. SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING “Begin at the beginning, and go on till you find the right key; then stop.” This sequential procedure is the obvious way to search, and it makes a useful starting point for our discussion of searching because many of the more intricate algorithms are based on it. We shall see that sequential searching involves some very interesting ideas, in spite of its simplicity.  The algorithm might be formulated more precisely as follows:  Algorithm S  Sequential search . Given a table of records R1, R2, . . . , RN, whose respective keys are K1, K2, . . . , KN, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. We assume that N ≥ 1. S1. [Initialize.] Set i ← 1. S2. [Compare.] If K = Ki, the algorithm terminates successfully. S3. [Advance.] Increase i by 1. S4. [End of file?] If i ≤ N, go back to S2. Otherwise the algorithm terminates  unsuccessfully. Notice that this algorithm can terminate in two different ways, successfully  having located the desired key  or unsuccessfully  having established that the given argument is not present in the table . The same will be true of most other algorithms in this chapter.  Fig. 1. Sequential or “house-to-house” search.  S1. Initialize  S2. Compare  S3. Advance   cid:54 =  =  SUCCESS  No  S4. End of ﬁle?

The analysis of this program is straightforward; it shows that the running  time of Algorithm S depends on two things,  C = the number of key comparisons; S = 1 if successful, 0 if unsuccessful.   1  Program S takes 5C − 2S + 3 units of time. If the search successfully finds K = Ki, we have C = i, S = 1; hence the total time is  5i + 1 u. On the other hand if the search is unsuccessful, we have C = N, S = 0, for a total time of  5N + 3 u.

We have saved 30 percent of the running time of Program S, when large tables are being searched; many existing programs can be improved in this way. The same ideas apply to programming in high-level languages. [See, for example, D. E. Knuth, Computing Surveys 6  1974 , 266–269.]  A slight variation of the algorithm is appropriate if we know that the keys  are in increasing order: Algorithm T  Sequential search in ordered table . Given a table of records R1, R2, . . . , RN whose keys are in increasing order K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. For convenience and speed, the algorithm assumes that there is a dummy record RN+1 whose key value is KN+1 = ∞ > K. T1. [Initialize.] Set i ← 1. T2. [Compare.] If K ≤ Ki, go to T4. T3.

If all input keys are equally likely, this algorithm takes essentially the same average time as Algorithm Q, for a successful search. But unsuccessful searches are performed about twice as fast, since the absence of a record can be established more quickly.  Each of the algorithms above uses subscripts to denote the table entries. It is convenient to describe the methods in terms of these subscripts, but the same search procedures can be used for tables that have a linked representation, since the data is being traversed sequentially.  See exercises 2, 3, and 4.  Frequency of access. So far we have been assuming that every argument occurs as often as every other. This is not always a realistic assumption; in a general situation, key Kj will occur with probability pj, where p1 + p2 + ··· + pN = 1. The time required to do a successful search is essentially proportional to the number of comparisons, C, which now has the average value   3  If we have the option of putting the records into the table in any desired order, this quantity C N is smallest when  C N = p1 + 2p2 + ··· + N pN .  p1 ≥ p2 ≥ ··· ≥ pN ,   4   that is, when the most frequently used records appear near the beginning.  Let’s look at several probability distributions, in order to see how much of a saving is possible when the records are arranged in the optimal manner specified in  4 . If p1 = p2 = ··· = pN = 1 N, formula  3  reduces to C N =  N + 1  2; we have already derived this in Eq.  2 . Suppose, on the other hand, that  p1 = 1 2 ,  p2 = 1 4 ,   5  Then C N = 2 − 21−N, by exercise 7; the average number of comparisons is less than two, for this distribution, if the records appear in the proper order within the table.  2N−1 .  . . . ,  pN−1 = 1 2N−1 ,  pN = 1  Another probability distribution that suggests itself is  p1 = N c,  p2 =  N − 1 c,  . . . ,  pN = c,  where c =  2  N N + 1  .   6   This wedge-shaped distribution is not as dramatic a departure from uniformity as  5 . In this case we find  C N = c  k N + 1 − k  = N + 2  ;  3   7   the optimum arrangement saves about one-third of the search time that would have been obtained if the records had appeared in random order.  N  k=1   400  SEARCHING  6.1  . . . ,  p1 = c 1,  p2 = c 2,  Of course the probability distributions in  5  and  6  are rather artificial, and they may never be a very good approximation to reality. A more typical sequence of probabilities, called “Zipf’s law,” has pN = c N,   8  This distribution was popularized by G. K. Zipf, who observed that the nth most common word in natural language text seems to occur with a frequency approx- imately proportional to 1 n. [The Psycho-Biology of Language  Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1935 ; Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort  Reading, Mass.: Addison–Wesley, 1949 .] He observed the same phenomenon in census tables, when metropolitan areas are ranked in order of decreasing population. If Zipf’s law governs the frequency of the keys in a table, we have immediately  where c = 1 HN .   9  C N = N HN; searching such a file is about 1 2 ln N times faster than searching the same file with randomly ordered records. [See A. D. Booth, L. Brandwood, and J. P. Cleave, Mechanical Resolution of Linguistic Problems  New York: Academic Press, 1958 , 79.]  Another approximation to realistic distributions is the “80-20” rule of thumb that has commonly been observed in commercial applications [see, for example, W. P. Heising, IBM Systems J. 2  1963 , 114–115]. This rule states that 80 per- cent of the transactions deal with the most active 20 percent of a file; and the same rule applies in fractal fashion to the top 20 percent, so that 64 percent of the transactions deal with the most active 4 percent, etc. In other words,  p1 + p2 + ··· + p.20n p1 + p2 + p3 + ··· + pn  ≈ .80  for all n.   10   One distribution that satisfies this rule exactly whenever n is a multiple of 5 is p1 = c,  11  where  pN =N θ− N−1 θc,  p3 =  3θ−2θ c,  p2 =  2θ−1 c,  . . . ,  c = 1 N θ,   12  since p1 + p2 + ··· + pn = cnθ for all n in this case. It is not especially easy to work with the probabilities in  11 ; we have, however, nθ −  n − 1 θ =  θnθ−11 + O 1 n , so there is a simpler distribution that approximately fulfills  log .20 ≈ 0.1386,  θ = log .80  the 80-20 rule, namely p1 = c 11−θ, p2 = c 21−θ,  . . . , pN = c N 1−θ,  where c = 1 H   1−θ   N  .   13    s  N is the Nth harmonic number of Here θ = log .80  log .20 as before, and H order s, namely 1−s + 2−s + ··· + N−s. Notice that this probability distribution is very similar to that of Zipf’s law  8 ; as θ varies from 1 to 0, the probabilities   6.1  SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING  401  H  H  vary from a uniform distribution to a Zipfian one. Applying  3  to  13  yields  C N = H   −θ   N   1−θ   N  θ + 1 + O N 1−θ  ≈ 0.122N = θN   14   as the mean number of comparisons for the 80-20 law  see exercise 8 .  A study of word frequencies carried out by E. S. Schwartz [see the interesting graph on page 422 of JACM 10  1963 ] suggests that distribution  13  with a slightly negative value of θ gives a better fit to the data than Zipf’s law  8 . In this case the mean value  C N = H   −θ   N   1−θ   N  =  N 1+θ   1 + θ ζ 1 − θ  + O N 1+2θ    15   is substantially smaller than  9  as N → ∞.  Distributions like  11  and  13  were first studied by Vilfredo Pareto in connection with disparities of personal income and wealth [Cours d’Économie Politique 2  Lausanne: Rouge, 1897 , 304–312]. If pk is proportional to the wealth of the kth richest individual, the probability that a person’s wealth exceeds or equals x times the wealth of the poorest individual is k N when x = pk pN. Thus, when pk = ckθ−1 and x =  k N θ−1, the stated probability is x−1  1−θ ; this is now called a Pareto distribution with parameter 1  1 − θ . Curiously, Pareto didn’t understand his own distribution; he believed that a value of θ near 0 would correspond to a more egalitarian society than a value near 1! His error was corrected by Corrado Gini [Atti della III Riunione della Società Italiana per il Progresso delle Scienze  1910 , reprinted in his Memorie di Metodologia Statistica 1  Rome: 1955 , 3–120], who was the first person to formulate and explain the significance of ratios like the 80-20 law  10 . People still tend to misunderstand such distributions; they often speak about a “75-25 law” or a “90-10 law” as if an a-b law makes sense only when a+ b = 100, while  12  shows that the sum 80 + 20 is quite irrelevant.  Another discrete distribution analogous to  11  and  13  was introduced by G. Udny Yule when he studied the increase in biological species as a function of time, assuming various models of evolution [Philos. Trans. B213  1924 , 21–87]. Yule’s distribution applies when θ < 2: p1 = c, p2 = c 2− θ   N − θ  . . .  2− θ  = cN−θ   N − 1 ! c  , p3 =  ;  2c  N−θ   3− θ  2− θ  , . . . , pN =  . 1 −N−θ  c = θ 1 − θ  N  N  N−1   16   The limiting value c = 1 HN or c = 1 N is used when θ = 0 or θ = 1. A “self-organizing” file. These calculations with probabilities are very nice, but in most cases we don’t know what the probabilities are. We could keep a count in each record of how often it has been accessed, reallocating the records on the basis of those counts; the formulas derived above suggest that this procedure would often lead to a worthwhile savings. But we probably don’t want to devote   402  SEARCHING  6.1  so much memory space to the count fields, since we can make better use of that memory by using one of the nonsequential search techniques that are explained later in this chapter.  A simple scheme, which has been in use for many years although its origin is unknown, can be used to keep the records in a pretty good order without auxiliary count fields: Whenever a record has been successfully located, it is moved to the front of the table.  The idea behind this “self-organizing” technique is that the oft-used items will tend to be located fairly near the beginning of the table, when we need them. If we assume that the N keys occur with respective probabilities {p1, p2, . . . , pN}, with each search being completely independent of previous searches, it can be shown that the average number of comparisons needed to find an item in such a self-organizing file tends to the limiting value  CN = 1 + 2   pipj pi + pj  1≤i<j≤N  2 +  i,j  = 1  pipj pi + pj  .   See exercise 11.  For example, if pi = 1 N for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the self-organizing table is always in completely random order, and this formula reduces to the familiar expression  N + 1  2 derived above. In general, the average number of  comparisons  17  is always less than twice the optimal value  3 , since CN ≤ 1 + 2N j=1 j − 1 pj = 2C N − 1. In fact, CN is always less than π 2 times the  optimal value C N [Chung, Hajela, and Seymour, J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 36  1988 , 148–157]; this ratio is the best possible constant in general, since it is approached when pj is proportional to 1 j2.  Let us see how well the self-organizing procedure works when the key prob-   17   abilities obey Zipf’s law  8 . We have  CN = 1 = 1  1  = 1  1≤i,j≤N   c i  c j  c i + c j   2 + c 2N  2 +  N N 2 + c 2N + 1 H2N − 2N − 2 N + 1 HN + 2N 2 + cN ln 4 − ln N + O 1  ≈ 2N lg N,   HN+i − Hi  = 1  Hi − 2c  1≤i,j≤N  2 + c  2 + c  i + j  i=1  i=1  i=1  Hi  = 1 = 1   18  by Eqs. 1.2.7– 8  and 1.2.7– 3 . This is substantially better than 1 2 N, when N is reasonably large, and it is only about ln 4 ≈ 1.386 times as many comparisons as would be obtained in the optimum arrangement; see  9 .  Computational experiments involving actual compiler symbol tables indicate that the self-organizing method works even better than our formulas predict, because successive searches are not independent  small groups of keys tend to occur in bunches .  This self-organizing scheme was first analyzed by John McCabe [Operations Research 13  1965 , 609–618], who established  17 . McCabe also introduced   6.1  SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING  403  another interesting scheme, under which each successfully located key that is not already at the beginning of the table is simply interchanged with the preceding key, instead of being moved all the way to the front. He conjectured that the limiting average search time for this method, assuming independent searches, never exceeds  17 . Several years later, Ronald L. Rivest proved in fact that the transposition method uses strictly fewer comparisons than the move-to-front method, in the long run, except of course when N ≤ 2 or when all the nonzero probabilities are equal [CACM 19  1976 , 63–67]. However, convergence to the asymptotic limit is much slower than for the move-to-front heuristic, so move-to- front is better unless the process is prolonged [J. R. Bitner, SICOMP 8  1979 , 82–110]. Moreover, J. L. Bentley, C. C. McGeoch, D. D. Sleator, and R. E. Tarjan have proved that the move-to-front method never makes more than four times the total number of memory accesses made by any algorithm on linear lists, given any sequence of accesses whatever to the data — even if the algorithm knows the future; the frequency-count and transposition methods do not have this property [CACM 28  1985 , 202–208, 404–411]. See SODA 8  1997 , 53–62, for an interesting empirical study of more than 40 heuristics for self-organizing lists, carried out by R. Bachrach and R. El-Yaniv. Tape searching with unequal-length records. Now let’s give the problem still another twist: Suppose the table we are searching is stored on tape, and the individual records have varying lengths. For example, in an old-fashioned operating system, the “system library tape” was such a file; standard system programs such as compilers, assemblers, loading routines, and report generators were the “records” on this tape, and most user jobs would start by searching down the tape until the appropriate routine had been input. This setup makes our previous analysis of Algorithm S inapplicable, since step S3 takes a variable amount of time each time we reach it. The number of comparisons is therefore not the only criterion of interest.  Let Li be the length of record Ri, and let pi be the probability that this record will be sought. The average running time of the search method will now be approximately proportional to  p1L1 + p2 L1 + L2  + ··· + pN L1 + L2 + L3 + ··· + LN .   19   When L1 = L2 = ··· = LN = 1, this reduces to  3 , the case already studied. It seems logical to put the most frequently needed records at the beginning of the tape; but this is sometimes a bad idea! For example, assume that the tape contains just two programs, A and B, where A is needed twice as often as B but it is four times as long. Thus,  N = 2,  pA = 2  pB = 1  3 , LB = 1.  If we place A first on tape, according to the “logical” principle stated above, the average running time is 2 3 ; but if we use an “illogical” idea, placing B first, the average running time is reduced to 1 The optimum arrangement of programs on a library tape may be determined  3 · 5 = 11 3 .  3 · 1 + 2  3 ·4+ 1  3 , LA = 4, 3 ·5 = 13  as follows.   404  SEARCHING  6.1   20   Theorem S. Let Li and pi be as defined above. The arrangement of records in the table is optimal if and only if  p1 L1 ≥ p2 L2 ≥ ··· ≥ pN  LN .  In other words, the minimum value of  pa1 La1 + pa2 La1 + La2  + ··· + paN  La1 + ··· + LaN  ,  over all permutations a1 a2 . . . aN of {1, 2, . . . , N}, is equal to  19  if and only if  20  holds. Proof. Suppose that Ri and Ri+1 are interchanged on the tape; the cost  19  changes from  to  ··· + pi L1 + ··· + Li−1 + Li  + pi+1 L1 + ··· + Li+1  + ··· ··· + pi+1 L1 + ··· + Li−1 + Li+1  + pi L1 + ··· + Li+1  + ··· ,  a net change of piLi+1 − pi+1Li. Therefore if pi Li < pi+1 Li+1, such an interchange will improve the average running time, and the given arrangement is not optimal. It follows that  20  holds in any optimal arrangement.  Conversely, assume that  20  holds; we need to prove that the arrangement is optimal. The argument just given shows that the arrangement is “locally optimal” in the sense that adjacent interchanges make no improvement; but there may conceivably be a long, complicated sequence of interchanges that leads to a better “global optimum.” We shall consider two proofs, one that uses computer science and one that uses a mathematical trick. First proof. Assume that  20  holds. We know that any permutation of the records can be sorted into the order R1 R2 . . . RN by using a sequence of inter- changes of adjacent records. Each of these interchanges replaces . . . RjRi . . . by . . . RiRj . . . for some i < j, so it decreases the search time by the nonnegative amount piLj − pjLi. Therefore the order R1 R2 . . . RN must have minimum search time. Second proof. Replace each probability pi by  pi ϵ  = pi + ϵi −  ϵ1 + ϵ2 + ··· + ϵN  N,   21  where ϵ is an extremely small positive number. When ϵ is sufficiently small, we will never have x1p1 ϵ +···+ xN pN ϵ  = y1p1 ϵ +···+ yN pN ϵ  unless x1 = y1, . . . , xN = yN; in particular, equality will not hold in  20 . Consider now the N! permutations of the records; at least one of them is optimum, and we know that it satisfies  20 . But only one permutation satisfies  20  because there are no equalities. Therefore  20  uniquely characterizes the optimum arrangement of records in the table for the probabilities pi ϵ , whenever ϵ is sufficiently small. By continuity, the same arrangement must also be optimum when ϵ is set equal to zero.  This “tie-breaking” type of proof is often useful in connection with combinatorial optimization.    6.1  SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING  405  Theorem S is due to W. E. Smith, Naval Research Logistics Quarterly 3  1956 , 59–66. The exercises below contain further results about optimum file arrangements.  EXERCISES 1.

[15] Restate the steps of Algorithm S, using linked-memory notation instead of subscript notation.  If P points to a record in the table, assume that KEY P  is the key, INFO P  is the associated information, and LINK P  is a pointer to the next record. Assume also that FIRST points to the first record, and that the last record points to Λ.  3. [16] Write a MIX program for the algorithm of exercise 2.

Then, for example, the probability that no subroutines at all are needed is  1 − P1  1 − P2  . . .  1 − PN ; and the probability that the search will end just after loading the jth subroutine is Pj  1 − Pj+1  . . .  1 − PN .

For example, we may want to test whether both x > 0 and y < z2, and it is not immediately clear which condition should be tested first.  Suppose that the testing of condition j costs Tj units of time, and that the condition will be true with probability pj, independent of the outcomes of all the other conditions. In what order should we make the tests?   6.1  SEQUENTIAL SEARCHING  407  Fig. 2. An “organ-pipe arrangement” of probabilities minimizes the average seek time in a catenated search.  17. [M23]  J. R.

This model can be applied, for example, to disk file seek time, if d i, j  is the time needed to travel from cylinder i to cylinder j. The object of this exercise is to characterize the optimum placement of records for catenated searches, whenever d i, j  is an increasing function of i − j, that is, whenever for d1 < d2 < ··· < dN−1.  The value of d0 is irrelevant.  Prove we have d i, j  = di−j that in this case the records are optimally placed, among all N! permutations, if and only if either p1 ≤ pN ≤ p2 ≤ pN−1 ≤ ··· ≤ p⌊N 2⌋+1 or pN ≤ p1 ≤ pN−1 ≤ p2 ≤ ··· ≤ p⌈N 2⌉ .

SEARCHING BY COMPARISON OF KEYS In this section we shall discuss search methods that are based on a linear ordering of the keys, such as alphabetic order or numeric order. After comparing the given argument K to a key Ki in the table, the search continues in three different ways, depending on whether K   Ki. The sequential search methods of Section 6.1 were essentially limited to a two-way decision  K = Ki versus K ̸= Ki , but if we free ourselves from the restriction of sequential access we are able to make effective use of an order relation.  6.2.1. Searching an Ordered Table What would you do if someone handed you a large telephone directory and told you to find the name of the person whose number is 795-6841? There is no better way to tackle this problem than to use the sequential methods of Section 6.1.  Well, you might try to dial the number and talk to the person who answers; or you might know how to obtain a special directory that is sorted by number instead of by name.  The point is that it is much easier to find an entry by the party’s name, instead of by number, although the telephone directory contains all the information necessary in both cases. When a large file must be searched, sequential scanning is almost out of the question, but an ordering relation simplifies the job enormously.  With so many sorting methods at our disposal  Chapter 5 , we will have little difficulty rearranging a file into order so that it may be searched conveniently. Of course, if we need to search the table only once, a sequential search would be faster than to do a complete sort of the file; but if we need to make repeated searches in the same file, we are better off having it in order. Therefore in this section we shall concentrate on methods that are appropriate for searching a table whose keys satisfy  K1 < K2 < ··· < KN ,  assuming that we can easily access the key in any given position. After comparing K to Ki in such a table, we have either    K < Ki   K = Ki   K > Ki  or or  [Ri, Ri+1, . . . , RN are eliminated from consideration]; [the search is done]; [R1, R2, . . . , Ri are eliminated from consideration].  In each of these three cases, substantial progress has been made, unless i is near one of the ends of the table; this is why the ordering leads to an efficient algorithm. Binary search. Perhaps the first such method that suggests itself is to start by comparing K to the middle key in the table; the result of this probe tells which half of the table should be searched next, and the same procedure can be used again, comparing K to the middle key of the selected half, etc. After at most about lg N comparisons, we will have found the key or we will have established   410  SEARCHING  6.2.1  Fig. 3. Binary search.  that it is not present. This procedure is sometimes known as “logarithmic search” or “bisection,” but it is most commonly called binary search.  Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky, and many good programmers have done it wrong the first few times they tried. One of the most popular correct forms of the algorithm makes use of two pointers, l and u, that indicate the current lower and upper limits for the search, as follows: Algorithm B  Binary search . Given a table of records R1, R2, . . . , RN whose keys are in increasing order K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. B1. [Initialize.] Set l ← 1, u ← N. B2. [Get midpoint.]  At this point we know that if K is in the table, it satisfies Kl ≤ K ≤ Ku. A more precise statement of the situation appears in exer- cise 1 below.  If u < l, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise,  set i ← l + u  2, the approximate midpoint of the relevant table area.  B3. [Compare.] If K   Ki, go to B5; and if K = Ki, the  algorithm terminates successfully.  B4. [Adjust u.] Set u ← i − 1 and return to B2. B5. [Adjust l.] Set l ← i + 1 and return to B2.  Figure 4 illustrates two cases of this binary search algorithm: first to search for the argument 653, which is present in the table, and then to search for 400, which is absent. The brackets indicate l and u, and the underlined key repre- sents Ki. In both examples the search terminates after making four comparisons.  B1. Initialize  B2. Get midpoint  FAILURE  u < l  B4.

A tree representation. In order to really understand what is happening in Algorithm B, our best bet is to think of the procedure as a binary decision tree, as shown in Fig. 5 for the case N = 16.   412  SEARCHING  6.2.1  Fig. 5. A comparison tree that corresponds to binary search when N = 16.  represented by the root node  cid:107 8  When N is 16, the first comparison made by the algorithm is K : K8; this is in the figure. Then if K < K8, the algorithm follows the left subtree, comparing K to K4; similarly if K > K8, the right subtree is used. An unsuccessful search will lead to one of the external square nodes numbered 0 if and only if K6 < K < K7.  through N ; for example, we reach node 6  The binary tree corresponding to a binary search on N records can be constructed as follows: If N = 0, the tree is simply 0 . Otherwise the root node is   cid:11   cid:8  cid:10   cid:9 ⌈N 2⌉ ,   cid:107 2   cid:107 1  the left subtree is the corresponding binary tree with ⌈N 2⌉ − 1 nodes, and the right subtree is the corresponding binary tree with ⌊N 2⌋ nodes and with all node numbers increased by ⌈N 2⌉.  In an analogous fashion, any algorithm for searching an ordered table of length N by means of comparisons can be represented as an N-node binary tree in which the nodes are labeled with the numbers 1 to N  unless the algorithm makes redundant comparisons . Conversely, any binary tree corresponds to a valid method for searching an ordered table; we simply label the nodes  N   1   0  1  2  . . .  N−1  in symmetric order, from left to right.  If the search argument input to Algorithm B is K10, the algorithm makes the comparisons K > K8, K < K12, K = K10. This corresponds to the path from  the root to  cid:107 10 in Fig. 5. Similarly, the behavior of Algorithm B on other keys  corresponds to the other paths leading from the root of the tree. The method of constructing the binary trees corresponding to Algorithm B therefore makes it easy to prove the following result by induction on N: Theorem B. If 2k−1 ≤ N < 2k, a successful search using Algorithm B requires If N = 2k − 1, an unsuccessful search requires  min 1, max k  comparisons.   cid:107   N  8  4  12  2  6  10  14  1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  16  15  16   SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE  6.2.1 413 k comparisons; and if 2k−1 ≤ N < 2k − 1, an unsuccessful search requires either k − 1 or k comparisons.  Further analysis of binary search. Nonmathematical readers should skip to Eq.  4 . The tree representation shows us also how to compute the average  number of comparisons in a simple way. Let CN be the average number of comparisons in a successful search, assuming that each of the N keys is an equally likely argument; and let C′N be the average number of comparisons in an unsuccessful search, assuming that each of the N + 1 intervals between and outside the extreme values of the keys is equally likely. Then we have C′N = external path length of tree CN = 1 + internal path length of tree by the definition of internal and external path length. We saw in Eq. 2.3.4.5– 3  that the external path length is always 2N more than the internal path length. Hence there is a rather unexpected relationship between CN and C′N:  N + 1  N  ,  ,      CN =  1 + 1  N  C′N − 1.   2   This formula, which is due to T. N. Hibbard [JACM 9  1962 , 16–17], holds for all search methods that correspond to binary trees; in other words, it holds for all methods that are based on nonredundant comparisons. The variance of successful-search comparisons can also be expressed in terms of the corresponding variance for unsuccessful searches  see exercise 25 .  From the formulas above we can see that the “best” way to search by comparisons is one whose tree has minimum external path length, over all binary trees with N internal nodes. Fortunately it can be proved that Algorithm B is optimum in this sense, for all N; for we have seen  exercise 5.3.1–20  that a binary tree has minimum path length if and only if its external nodes all occur on at most two adjacent levels. It follows that the external path length of the tree corresponding to Algorithm B is  See Eq. 5.3.1– 34 . From this formula and  2  we can compute the exact   N + 1 ⌊lg N⌋ + 2 − 2⌊lg N⌋+1.  average number of comparisons, assuming that all search arguments are equally probable.

No search method based on comparisons can do better than this. The average running time of Program B is approximately   5    18 lg N − 16 u  18 lg N + 12 u  for a successful search, for an unsuccessful search, if we assume that all outcomes of the search are equally likely. An important variation. Instead of using three pointers l, i, and u in the search, it is tempting to use only two, namely the current position i and its rate of change, δ; after each unequal comparison, we could then set i ← i ± δ and δ ← δ 2  approximately . It is possible to do this, but only if extreme care is paid to the details, as in the following algorithm. Simpler approaches are doomed to failure! Algorithm U  Uniform binary search . Given a table of records R1, R2, . . . , RN whose keys are in increasing order K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. If N is even, the algorithm will sometimes refer to a dummy key K0 that should be set to −∞  or any value less than K . We assume that N ≥ 1. U1. [Initialize.] Set i ← ⌈N 2⌉, m ← ⌊N 2⌋. U2.

[Decrease i.]  We have pinpointed the search to an interval that contains either m or m−1 records; i points just to the right of this interval.  If m = 0, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise set i ← i−⌈m 2⌉; then set m ← ⌊m 2⌋ and return to U2.  U4. [Increase i.]  We have pinpointed the search to an interval that contains either m or m−1 records; i points just to the left of this interval.  If m = 0, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise set i ← i +⌈m 2⌉; then set m ← ⌊m 2⌋ and return to U2. Figure 6 shows the corresponding binary tree for the search, when N = 10. In an unsuccessful search, the algorithm may make a redundant comparison just before termination; those nodes are shaded in the figure. We may call the search process uniform because the difference between the number of a node on level l and the number of its ancestor on level l − 1 has a constant value δ for all nodes on level l. The theory underlying Algorithm U can be understood as follows: Suppose that we have an interval of length n− 1 to search; a comparison with the middle element  for n even  or with one of the two middle elements  for n odd  leaves us with two intervals of lengths ⌊n 2⌋−1 and ⌈n 2⌉−1. After repeating this process k times, we obtain 2k intervals, of which the smallest has length ⌊n 2k⌋ − 1 and the largest has length ⌈n 2k⌉−1. Hence the lengths of two intervals at the same   6.2.1  SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE  415  Fig. 6. The comparison tree for a “uniform” binary search, when N = 10.  level differ by at most unity; this makes it possible to choose an appropriate “middle” element, without keeping track of the exact lengths.  The principal advantage of Algorithm U is that we need not maintain the value of m at all; we need only refer to a short table of the various δ to use at each level of the tree. Thus the algorithm reduces to the following procedure, which is equally good on binary or decimal computers: Algorithm C  Uniform binary search . This algorithm is just like Algorithm U, but it uses an auxiliary table in place of the calculations involving m.

In a successful search, this algorithm corresponds to a binary tree with the same internal path length as the tree of Algorithm B, so the average number of comparisons CN is the same as before. In an unsuccessful search, Algorithm C always makes exactly ⌊lg N⌋ + 1 comparisons. The total running time of Pro- gram C is not quite symmetrical between left and right branches, since C1 is weighted more heavily than C2, but exercise 11 shows that we have K < Ki roughly as often as K > Ki; hence Program C takes approximately   8.5 lg N − 6 u  8.5⌊lg N⌋ + 12 u  for a successful search, for an unsuccessful search.   7   This is more than twice as fast as Program B, without using any special prop- erties of binary computers, even though the running times  5  for Program B assume that MIX has a “shift right binary” instruction.  where l =lg N − 2k + 1 , and pretend that the first comparison was actually  Another modification of binary search, suggested in 1971 by L. E. Shar, will be still faster on some computers, because it is uniform after the first step, and it requires no table. The first step is to compare K with Ki, where i = 2k, k = ⌊lg N⌋. If K < Ki, we use a uniform search with the δ’s equal to 2k−1, 2k−2, . . . , 1, 0. On the other hand, if K > Ki we reset i to i′ = N + 1 − 2l, K > Ki′, using a uniform search with the δ’s equal to 2l−1, 2l−2, . . . , 1, 0. Shar’s method is illustrated for N = 10 in Fig. 7. Like the previous algorithms, it never makes more than ⌊lg N⌋ + 1 comparisons; hence it makes at most one more than the minimum possible average number of comparisons, in spite of the fact that it occasionally goes through several redundant steps in succession  see exercise 12 .  8  4  9  2  6  8  10  1  3  5  7  8  9  10  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7   6.2.1  SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE  417  Fig. 8.

See also exercise 24, for a method that is faster yet. *Fibonaccian search. In the polyphase merge we have seen that the Fibonacci numbers can play a role analogous to the powers of 2. A similar phenomenon occurs in searching, where Fibonacci numbers provide us with an alternative to binary search. The resulting method is preferable on some computers, because it involves only addition and subtraction, not division by 2. The procedure we are about to discuss should be distinguished from an important numerical procedure called “Fibonacci search,” which is used to locate the maximum of a unimodal function [see Fibonacci Quarterly 4  1966 , 265–269]; the similarity of names has led to some confusion.  The Fibonaccian search technique looks very mysterious at first glance, if we simply take the program and try to explain what is happening; it seems to work by magic. But the mystery disappears as soon as the corresponding search tree is displayed. Therefore we shall begin our study of the method by looking at Fibonacci trees.  Figure 8 shows the Fibonacci tree of order 6. It looks somewhat more like a real-life shrub than the other trees we have been considering, perhaps because many natural processes satisfy a Fibonacci law. In general, the Fibonacci tree of order k has Fk+1 − 1 internal  circular  nodes and Fk+1 external  square  nodes, and it is constructed as follows:  If k = 0 or k = 1, the tree is simply 0 . If k ≥ 2, the root is Fk; the left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order k − 1; and the right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order k − 2 with all numbers increased by Fk.  Except for the external nodes, the numbers on the two children of each internal node differ from their parent’s number by the same amount, and this amount  8  5  11  3  7  10  12  2  4  6  7  9  10  11  12  1  2  3  4  5  6  8  9  0  1   SEARCHING  418 6.2.1 is a Fibonacci number. For example, 5 = 8 − F4 and 11 = 8 + F4 in Fig. 8. When the difference is Fj, the corresponding Fibonacci difference for the next branch on the left is Fj−1, while on the right it skips down to Fj−2. For example, 3 = 5 − F3 while 10 = 11 − F2. If we combine these observations with an appropriate mechanism for recog- nizing the external nodes, we arrive at the following method: Algorithm F  Fibonaccian search . Given a table of records R1, R2, . . . , RN whose keys are in increasing order K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. For convenience in description, we assume that N + 1 is a perfect Fibonacci number, Fk+1. It is not difficult to make the method work for arbitrary N, if a suitable initialization is provided  see exercise 14 . F1. [Initialize.] Set i ← Fk, p ← Fk−1, q ← Fk−2.  Throughout the algorithm, F2. [Compare.] If K   Ki, go to F4; and if K = Ki,  p and q will be consecutive Fibonacci numbers.   the algorithm terminates successfully.  F3. [Decrease i.] If q = 0, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise  set i ← i − q, and set  p, q  ←  q, p−q ; then return to F2.  F4. [Increase i.] If p = 1, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. Otherwise  set i ← i + q, p ← p − q, then q ← q − p, and return to F2. The following MIX implementation gains speed by making two copies of the inner loop, one in which p is in rI2 and q in rI3, and one in which the registers are reversed; this simplifies step F3. In fact, the program actually keeps p − 1 and q − 1 in the registers, instead of p and q, in order to simplify the test “p = 1?” in step F4. Program F  Fibonaccian search .

Figure 8 shows, and the analysis proves, that a left branch is taken somewhat more often than a right branch. Let C, C1, and  C2 − S  be the respective number of times steps F2, F3, and F4 are performed. Then we have  ϕk   C =  ave C1 =  ave  k  C2 − S =  ave ϕ−1k   5 + O 1 , max k − 1 , 5 + O 1 , max k − 1 , 5 + O 1 , max ⌊k 2⌋ .  √ √ √   8   1 5   18 + 4ϕ k + 31 − 26ϕu ≈  7.050 lg N + 1.08 u  Thus the left branch is taken about ϕ ≈ 1.618 times as often as the right branch  a fact that we might have guessed, since each probe divides the remaining interval into two parts, with the left part about ϕ times as large as the right . The total average running time of Program F therefore comes to approximately  9  for a successful search, plus  9−3ϕ u ≈ 4.15u for an unsuccessful search. This is faster than Program C, although the worst-case running time  roughly 8.6 lg N  is slightly slower. Interpolation search. Let’s forget computers for a moment, and consider how people actually carry out a search. Sometimes everyday life provides us with clues that lead to good algorithms.  Imagine yourself looking up a word in a dictionary. You probably don’t begin by looking first at the middle page, then looking at the 1 4 or 3 4 point, etc., as in a binary search. It’s even less likely that you use a Fibonaccian search! If the word you want starts with the letter A, you probably begin near the front of the dictionary. In fact, many dictionaries have thumb indexes that show the starting page or the middle page for the words beginning with a fixed letter. This thumb-index technique can readily be adapted to computers, and it will speed up the search; such algorithms are explored in Section 6.3.  Yet even after the initial point of search has been found, your actions still are not much like the methods we have discussed. If you notice that the desired word is alphabetically much greater than the words on the page being examined, you will turn over a fairly large chunk of pages before making the next reference.   420  SEARCHING  6.2.1  √  This is quite different from the algorithms above, which make no distinction between “much greater” and “slightly greater.”  Such considerations suggest an algorithm that might be called interpolation search: When we know that K lies between Kl and Ku, we can choose the next probe to be about  K − Kl   Ku − Kl  of the way between l and u, assuming that the keys are numeric and that they increase in a roughly constant manner throughout the interval.  Interpolation search is asymptotically superior to binary search. One step of binary search essentially reduces the amount of uncertainty from n to 1 2 n, while one step of interpolation search essentially reduces it to n, when the keys in the table are randomly distributed. Hence interpolation search takes about lg lg N steps, on the average, to reduce the uncertainty from N to 2.  See exercise 22.  However, computer simulation experiments show that interpolation search does not decrease the number of comparisons enough to compensate for the extra computing time involved, unless the table is rather large. Typical files aren’t sufficiently random, and the difference between lg lg N and lg N is not substantial unless N exceeds, say, 216 = 65,536. Interpolation is most successful in the early stages of searching a large possibly external file; after the range has been narrowed down, binary search finishes things off more quickly.  Note that dictionary lookup by hand is essentially an external, not an internal, search. We shall discuss external searching later.  History and bibliography. The earliest known example of a long list of items that was sorted into order to facilitate searching is the remarkable Babylonian reciprocal table of Inakibit-Anu, dating from about 200 B.C. This clay tablet contains more than 100 pairs of values, which appear to be the beginning of a list of approximately 500 multiple-precision sexagesimal numbers and their reciprocals, sorted into lexicographic order. For example, the list included the following sequence of entries:  01 13 09 34 29 08 08 53 20 01 13 14 31 52 30 01 13 43 40 48 01 13 48 40 30 01 14 04 26 40  49 12 27 49 09 07 12 48 49 41 15 48 46 22 59 25 25 55 33 20 48 36  The task of sorting 500 entries like this, given the technology available at that time, must have been phenomenal. [See D. E. Knuth, Selected Papers on Com- puter Science  Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996 , Chapter 11, for further details.] It is fairly natural to sort numerical values into order, but an order relation between letters or words does not suggest itself so readily. Yet a collating sequence for individual letters was present already in the most ancient alpha- bets. For example, many of the Biblical psalms have verses that follow a strict alphabetic sequence, the first verse starting with aleph, the second with beth, etc.; this was an aid to memory. Eventually the standard sequence of letters was used by Semitic and Greek peoples to denote numerals; for example, α, β, γ stood for 1, 2, 3, respectively.   6.2.1  SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE  421  The use of alphabetic order for entire words seems to be a much later invention; it is something we might think is obvious, yet it has to be taught to children, and at some point in history it was necessary to teach it to adults. Several lists from about 300 B.C. have been found on the Aegean Islands, giving the names of people in certain religious cults; these lists have been alphabetized, but only by the first letter, thus representing only the first pass of a left- to-right radix sort. Some Greek papyri from the years A.D. 134–135 contain fragments of ledgers that show the names of taxpayers alphabetized by the first two letters. Apollonius Sophista used alphabetic order on the first two letters, and often on subsequent letters, in his lengthy concordance of Homer’s poetry  first century A.D. . A few examples of more perfect alphabetization are known, notably Galen’s Hippocratic Glosses  c. 200 , but they are very rare. Words were arranged by their first letter only in the Etymologiarum of St. Isidorus  c. 630, Book x ; and the Corpus Glossary  c. 725  used only the first two letters of each word. The latter two works were perhaps the largest nonnumerical files of data to be compiled during the Middle Ages.  It is not until Giovanni di Genoa’s Catholicon  1286  that we find a specific  description of true alphabetical order. In his preface, Giovanni explained that  amo abeo amatus imprudens iusticia polisintheton  precedes precedes precedes precedes precedes precedes  bibo adeo amor impudens iustus polissenus   thereby giving examples of situations in which the ordering is determined by the 1st, 2nd, . . . , 6th letters , “and so in like manner.” He remarked that strenuous effort was required to devise these rules. “I beg of you, therefore, good reader, do not scorn this great labor of mine and this order as something worthless.”  A detailed study of the development of alphabetic order, up to the time printing was invented, has been made by Lloyd W. Daly [Collection Latomus 90  1967 , 100 pages]. He found some interesting old manuscripts that were evidently used as worksheets while sorting words by their first letters  see pages 89–90 of his monograph .  The first dictionary of English, Robert Cawdrey’s Table Alphabeticall  Lon-  don, 1604 , contains the following instructions:  Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, beginne with  a  then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with  v  looke towards the end. Againe, if thy word beginne with  ca  looke in the beginning of the letter  c  but if with  cu  then looke toward the end of that letter. And so of all the rest. &c.  Cawdrey seems to have been teaching himself how to alphabetize as he prepared his dictionary; numerous misplaced words appear on the first few pages, but the alphabetic order in the last part is not as bad.   422  SEARCHING  6.2.1  Binary search was first mentioned by John Mauchly, in what was perhaps the first published discussion of nonnumerical programming methods [Theory and Techniques for the Design of Electronic Digital Computers, edited by G. W. Pat- terson, 1  1946 , 9.7–9.8; 3  1946 , 22.8–22.9]. The method became well known to programmers, but nobody seems to have worked out the details of what should be done when N does not have the special form 2n−1. [See A. D. Booth, Nature 176  1955 , 565; A. I. Dumey, Computers and Automation 5  December 1956 , 7, where binary search is called “Twenty Questions”; Daniel D. McCracken, Digital Computer Programming  Wiley, 1957 , 201–203; and M. Halpern, CACM 1, 1  February 1958 , 1–3.]  i ← ⌈ l + u  2⌉  D. H. Lehmer [Proc. Symp. Appl. Math. 10  1960 , 180–181] was apparently the first to publish a binary search algorithm that works for all N. The next step was taken by H. Bottenbruch [JACM 9  1962 , 214], who presented an interesting variation of Algorithm B that avoids a separate test for equality until the very end: Using instead of i ← ⌊ l + u  2⌋ in step B2, he set l ← i whenever K ≥ Ki; then u − l decreases at every step. Eventually, when l = u, we have Kl ≤ K < Kl+1, and we can test whether or not the search was successful by making one more comparison.  He assumed that K ≥ K1 initially.  This idea speeds up the inner loop slightly on many computers, and the same principle can be used with all of the algorithms we have discussed in this section; but a successful search will require about one more iteration, on the average, because of  2 . Since the inner loop is performed only about lg N times, this tradeoff between an extra iteration and a faster loop does not save time unless n is extremely large.  See exercise 23.  On the other hand Bottenbruch’s algorithm will find the rightmost occurrence of a given key when the table contains duplicates, and this property is occasionally important.  K. E. Iverson [A Programming Language  Wiley, 1962 , 141] gave the proce- dure of Algorithm B, but without considering the possibility of an unsuccessful search. D. E. Knuth [CACM 6  1963 , 556–558] presented Algorithm B as an example used with an automated flowcharting system. The uniform binary search, Algorithm C, was suggested to the author by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University in 1971.  Fibonaccian searching was invented by David E. Ferguson [CACM 3  1960 , 648]. Binary trees similar to Fibonacci trees appeared in the pioneering work of the Norwegian mathematician Axel Thue as early as 1910  see exercise 28 . A Fibonacci tree without labels was also exhibited as a curiosity in the first edition of Hugo Steinhaus’s popular book Mathematical Snapshots  New York: Stechert, 1938 , page 28; he drew it upside down and made it look like a real tree, with right branches twice as long as left branches so that all the leaves would occur at the same level.  Interpolation searching was suggested by W. W. Peterson [IBM J. Res. & Devel. 1  1957 , 131–132]. A correct analysis of its average behavior was not discovered until many years later  see exercise 22 .   6.2.1  SEARCHING AN ORDERED TABLE  423  EXERCISES   cid:120  1.

[M42] Carry out a detailed analysis of the average running time of the algorithm suggested in exercise 14. 20. [M22] The number of comparisons required in a binary search is approximately √ log2 N, and in the Fibonaccian search it is roughly  ϕ  5  logϕ N. The purpose of this exercise is to show that these formulas are special cases of a more general result. Let p and q be positive numbers with p + q = 1. Consider a search algorithm that, given a table of N numbers in increasing order, starts by comparing the argument with the  pN th key, and iterates this procedure on the smaller blocks.  The binary search has p = q = 1 2; the Fibonaccian search has p = 1 ϕ, q = 1 ϕ2.   If C N  denotes the average number of comparisons required to search a table of  size N, it approximately satisfies the relations  C 1  = 0;  C N  = 1 + pC pN  + qC qN   for N > 1.  This happens because there is probability p  roughly  that the search reduces to a pN-element search, and probability q that it reduces to a qN-element search, after the first comparison. When N is large, we may ignore the small-order effect caused by the fact that pN and qN aren’t exactly integers. a  Show that C N  = logb N satisfies these relations exactly, for a certain choice of b. For binary and Fibonaccian search, this value of b agrees with the formulas derived earlier.  b  Consider the following argument: “With probability p, the size of the interval being scanned in this algorithm is divided by 1 p; with probability q, the interval size is divided by 1 q. Therefore the interval is divided by p ·  1 p  + q ·  1 q  = 2 on the average, so the algorithm is exactly as good as the binary search, regardless of p and q.” Is there anything wrong with this reasoning?

[20] Draw the binary tree corresponding to interpolation search when N = 10. 22. [M41]  A. C. Yao and F. F. Yao.  Show that an appropriate formulation of interpolation search requires asymptotically lg lg N comparisons, on the average, when applied to N independent uniform random keys that have been sorted. Furthermore all search algorithms on such tables must make asymptotically lg lg N comparisons, on the average.   cid:120  23. [25] The binary search algorithm of H. Bottenbruch, mentioned at the close of  this section, avoids testing for equality until the very end of the search.  During the algorithm we know that Kl ≤ K < Ku+1, and the case of equality is not examined until l = u.  Such a trick would make Program B run a little bit faster for large N, since the ‘JE’ instruction could be removed from the inner loop.  However, the idea wouldn’t really be practical since lg N is always rather small; we would need N > 266 in order to compensate for the extra work necessary on a successful search, because the running time  18 lg N − 16 u of  5  is “decreased” to  17.5 lg N + 17 u!  Show that every search algorithm corresponding to a binary tree can be adapted to a search algorithm that uses two-way branching   < versus ≥   at the internal nodes of the tree, in place of the three-way branching       used in the text’s discussion. In particular, show how to modify Algorithm C in this way.   cid:120  24. [23] We have seen in Sections 2.3.4.5 and 5.2.3 that the complete binary tree is  cid:120  25.

Thus in the text’s notation we have CN = mean g , C′N = mean h , and Eq.  2  gives a relation between these quantities.  Find a relation between var g  and var h .  26. [22] Show that Fibonacci trees are related to polyphase merge sorting on three tapes. 27. [M30]  H. S. Stone and John Linn.  Consider a search process that uses k processors simultaneously and that is based solely on comparisons of keys. Thus at every step of the search, k indices i1, . . . , ik are specified, and we perform k simultaneous comparisons; if K = Kij for some j, the search terminates successfully, otherwise the search proceeds to the next step based on the 2k possible outcomes K < Kij or K > Kij , for 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Prove that such a process must always take at least approximately logk+1 N steps on the average, as N → ∞, assuming that each key of the table is equally likely as a search argument.  Hence the potential increase in speed over 1-processor binary search is only a factor of lg k +1 , not the factor of k we might expect. In this sense it is more efficient to assign each processor to a different, independent search problem, instead of making them cooperate on a single search.    426  SEARCHING  6.2.1  28.

Show that we can locate any given key K, or determine that K is not present, by making at most 2⌊lg N⌋+1 comparisons. 30. [27]  Involution coding.  Using the idea of the previous exercise, find a way to arrange N distinct keys in such a way that their relative order implicitly encodes an arbitrarily given array of t-bit numbers x1, x2, . . . , xm, when m ≤ N 4 + 1 − 2t. With your arrangement it should be possible to determine the leading k bits of xj by making only k comparisons, for any given j, as well as to look up an arbitrary key with ≤ 2⌊lg N⌋+1 comparisons.  This result is used in theoretical studies of data structures that are asymptotically efficient in both time and space.   6.2.2. Binary Tree Searching In the preceding section, we learned that an implicit binary tree structure makes the behavior of binary search and Fibonaccian search easier to understand. For a given value of N, the tree corresponding to binary search achieves the theoretical minimum number of comparisons that are necessary to search a table by means of key comparisons. But the methods of the preceding section are appropriate mainly for fixed-size tables, since the sequential allocation of records makes insertions and deletions rather expensive. If the table is changing dynamically, we might spend more time maintaining it than we save in binary-searching it.  The use of an explicit binary tree structure makes it possible to insert and delete records quickly, as well as to search the table efficiently. As a result, we essentially have a method that is useful both for searching and for sorting. This gain in flexibility is achieved by adding two link fields to each record of the table. Techniques for searching a growing table are often called symbol table algo- rithms, because assemblers and compilers and other system routines generally use such methods to keep track of user-defined symbols. For example, the key of each record within a compiler might be a symbolic identifier denoting a variable in some FORTRAN or C program, and the rest of the record might contain information about the type of that variable and its storage allocation. Or the key might be a symbol in a MIXAL program, with the rest of the record containing the equivalent of that symbol. The tree search and insertion routines to be described in this section are quite efficient for use as symbol table algorithms, especially in applications where it is desirable to print out a list of the symbols in alphabetic order. Other symbol table algorithms are described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4.  Figure 10 shows a binary search tree containing the names of eleven signs of the zodiac. If we now search for the twelfth name, SAGITTARIUS, starting at the   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  427  Fig. 10.

The search was unsuccessful; we can now insert SAGITTARIUS at the place the search ended, by linking it into the tree in place of the external node 8 . In this way the table can grow without the necessity of moving any of the existing records. Figure 10 was formed by starting with an empty tree and successively inserting the keys CAPRICORN, AQUARIUS, PISCES, ARIES, TAURUS, GEMINI, CANCER, LEO, VIRGO, LIBRA, SCORPIO, in this order.  All of the keys in the left subtree of the root in Fig. 10 are alphabetically less than CAPRICORN, and all keys in the right subtree are alphabetically greater. A similar statement holds for the left and right subtrees of every node. It follows that the keys appear in strict alphabetic sequence from left to right,  . . . ,  LEO,  ARIES,  GEMINI,  CANCER,  VIRGO AQUARIUS, if we traverse the tree in symmetric order  see Section 2.3.1 , since symmetric order is based on traversing the left subtree of each node just before that node, then traversing the right subtree.  CAPRICORN,  The following algorithm spells out the searching and insertion processes in  detail. Algorithm T  Tree search and insertion . Given a table of records that form a binary tree as described above, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. If K is not in the table, a new node containing K is inserted into the tree in the appropriate place.

Null subtrees  the external nodes in Fig. 10  are represented by the null pointer Λ. The variable ROOT points to the root of the tree. For convenience, we assume that the tree is not empty  that is, ROOT ̸= Λ , since the necessary operations are trivial when ROOT = Λ. T1. [Initialize.] Set P ← ROOT.  The pointer variable P will move down the tree.  T2. [Compare.] If K   KEY P , go to T4; and if If LLINK P  ̸= Λ, set P ← LLINK P  and go back to T2.  K = KEY P , the search terminates successfully.

Set Q ⇐ AVAIL, the address of a new node. Set KEY Q  ← K, LLINK Q  ← RLINK Q  ← Λ.  In practice, other fields of the new node should also be initialized.  If K was less than KEY P , set LLINK P  ← Q, otherwise set RLINK P  ← Q.  At this point we could set P ← Q and terminate the algorithm successfully.   Fig. 11. Tree search and insertion.  This algorithm lends itself to a convenient machine language implementa-  tion. We may assume, for example, that the tree nodes have the form  +  0 LLINK RLINK  KEY   1   followed perhaps by additional words of INFO. Using an AVAIL list for the free storage pool, as in Chapter 2, we can write the following MIX program:  T1. Initialize  =  T2. Compare  <  >  SUCCESS  T4. Move right  RLINK = Λ  T3.

C C C1  The first 13 lines of this program do the search; the last 11 lines do the insertion. The running time for the searching phase is  7C + C1 − 3S + 4 u, where  C = number of comparisons made; C1 = number of times K ≤ KEY P ; C2 = number of times K > KEY P ; S = [search is successful].  2 C + S , since C1 + C2 = C and C1 − S has On the average we have C1 = 1 the same probability distribution as C2; so the running time is about  7.5C − 2.5S + 4 u. This compares favorably with the binary search algorithms that use an implicit tree  see Program 6.2.1C . By duplicating the code as in Program 6.2.1F we could effectively eliminate line 08 of Program T, reducing the running time to  6.5C − 2.5S + 5 u. If the search is unsuccessful, the insertion phase of the program costs an extra 14u or 15u.  Algorithm T can conveniently be adapted to variable-length keys and vari- able-length records. For example, if we allocate the available space sequentially, in a last-in-first-out manner, we can easily create nodes of varying size; the first word of  1  could indicate the size. Since this is an efficient use of storage, symbol table algorithms based on trees are often especially attractive for use in compilers, assemblers, and loaders.   430  SEARCHING  6.2.2  But what about the worst case? Programmers are often skeptical of Algo- rithm T when they first see it. If the keys of Fig. 10 had been entered into the tree in alphabetic order AQUARIUS, . . . , VIRGO instead of the calendar order CAPRICORN, . . . , SCORPIO, the algorithm would have built a degenerate tree that essentially specifies a sequential search. All LLINKs would be null. Similarly, if the keys come in the uncommon order  AQUARIUS, VIRGO, ARIES, TAURUS, CANCER, SCORPIO,  CAPRICORN, PISCES, GEMINI, LIBRA, LEO  we obtain a “zigzag” tree that is just as bad.  Try it!   √  On the other hand, the particular tree in Fig. 10 requires only 3 2  11 com- parisons, on the average, for a successful search; this is just a little higher than the minimum possible average number of comparisons, 3, achievable in the best possible binary tree.  When we have a fairly balanced tree, the search time is roughly propor- tional to log N, but when we have a degenerate tree, the search time is roughly proportional to N. Exercise 2.3.4.5–5 proves that the average search time would N if we considered each N-node binary tree to be be roughly proportional to equally likely. What behavior can we really expect from Algorithm T? Fortunately, it turns out that tree search will require only about 2 ln N ≈ 1.386 lg N comparisons, if the keys are inserted into the tree in random order; well-balanced trees are common, and degenerate trees are very rare.  There is a surprisingly simple proof of this fact. Let us assume that each of the N! possible orderings of the N keys is an equally likely sequence of insertions for building the tree. The number of comparisons needed to find a key is exactly one more than the number of comparisons that were needed when that key was entered into the tree. Therefore if CN is the average number of comparisons involved in a successful search and C′N is the average number in an unsuccessful search, we have  But the relation between internal and external path length tells us that  CN = 1 + C′0 + C′1 + ··· + C′N−1  .    N    CN =  1 + 1  N  C′N − 1;  this is Eq. 6.2.1– 2 . Putting  3  together with  2  yields   N + 1 C′N = 2N + C′0 + C′1 + ··· + C′N−1.  This recurrence is easy to solve. Subtracting the equation  N C′N−1 = 2 N − 1  + C′0 + C′1 + ··· + C′N−2,  we obtain  N + 1 C′N − N C′N−1 = 2 + C′N−1,  hence  C′N = C′N−1 + 2  N + 1 .   2    3    4    431   5    6   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  Since C′0 = 0, this means that  Applying  3  and simplifying yields the desired result HN − 3.  1 + 1  CN = 2  C′N = 2HN+1 − 2.      N  Exercises 6, 7, and 8 below give more detailed information; it is possible to compute the exact probability distribution of CN and C′N, not merely the average values. Tree insertion sorting. Algorithm T was developed for searching, but it can also be used as the basis of an internal sorting algorithm; in fact, we can view it as a natural generalization of list insertion, Algorithm 5.2.1L. When properly programmed, its average running time will be only a little slower than some of the best algorithms we discussed in Chapter 5. After the tree has been constructed for all keys, a symmetric tree traversal  Algorithm 2.3.1T  will visit the records in sorted order.  A few precautions are necessary, however. Something different needs to be done if K = KEY P  in step T2, since we are sorting instead of searching. One solution is to treat K = KEY P  exactly as if K > KEY P ; this leads to a stable sorting method.  Equal keys will not necessarily be adjacent in the tree; they will only be adjacent in symmetric order.  But if many duplicate keys are present, this method will cause the tree to get badly unbalanced, and the sorting will slow down. Another idea is to keep a list, for each node, of all records having the same key; this requires another link field, but it will make the sorting faster when a lot of equal keys occur.  Thus if we are interested only in sorting, not in searching, Algorithm T isn’t the best, but it isn’t bad. And if we have an application that combines searching with sorting, the tree method can be warmly recommended.  It is interesting to note that there is a strong relation between the analysis of tree insertion sorting and the analysis of quicksort, although the methods are superficially dissimilar. If we successively insert N keys into an initially empty tree, we make the same average number of comparisons between keys as Algorithm 5.2.2Q does, with minor exceptions. For example, in tree insertion every key gets compared with K1, and then every key less than K1 gets compared with the first key less than K1, etc.; in quicksort, every key gets compared to the first partitioning element K and then every key less than K gets compared to a particular element less than K, etc. The average number of comparisons needed in both cases is N CN − N.  However, Algorithm 5.2.2Q actually makes a few more comparisons, in order to speed up the inner loops.  Deletions. Sometimes we want to make the computer forget one of the table entries it knows. We can easily delete a node in which either LLINK or RLINK = Λ; but when both subtrees are nonempty, we have to do something special, since we can’t point two ways at once.   432  SEARCHING  6.2.2  For example, consider Fig. 10 again; how could we delete the root node, CAPRICORN? One solution is to delete the alphabetically next node, which always has a null LLINK, then reinsert it in place of the node we really wanted to delete. For example, in Fig. 10 we could delete GEMINI, then replace CAPRICORN by GEMINI. This operation preserves the essential left-to-right order of the table entries. The following algorithm gives a detailed description of such a deletion process. Algorithm D  Tree deletion . Let Q be a variable that points to a node of a binary search tree represented as in Algorithm T. This algorithm deletes that node, leaving a binary search tree.  In practice, we will have either Q ≡ ROOT or Q ≡ LLINK P  or RLINK P  in some node of the tree. This algorithm resets the value of Q in memory, to reflect the deletion.  D1. [Is RLINK null?] Set T ← Q. If RLINK T  = Λ, set Q ← LLINK T  and go to D4.  For example, if Q ≡ RLINK P  for some P, we would set RLINK P  ← LLINK T .   D2. [Find successor.] Set R ← RLINK T . If LLINK R  = Λ, set LLINK R  ←  LLINK T , Q ← R, and go to D4.  D3. [Find null LLINK.] Set S ← LLINK R . Then if LLINK S  ̸= Λ, set R ← S and repeat this step until LLINK S  = Λ.  At this point S will be equal to Q$, the symmetric successor of Q.  Finally, set LLINK S  ← LLINK T , LLINK R  ← RLINK S , RLINK S  ← RLINK T , Q ← S.  D4. [Free the node.] Set AVAIL ⇐ T, thus returning the deleted node to the free  storage pool. The reader may wish to try this algorithm by deleting AQUARIUS, CANCER, and CAPRICORN from Fig. 10; each case is slightly different. An alert reader may have noticed that no special test has been made for the case RLINK T  ̸= Λ, LLINK T  = Λ; we will defer the discussion of this case until later, since the algorithm as it stands has some very interesting properties.  Since Algorithm D is quite unsymmetrical between left and right, it stands to reason that a sequence of deletions will make the tree get way out of balance, so that the efficiency estimates we have made will be invalid. But deletions don’t actually make the trees degenerate at all!  N. Hibbard, 1962  + .  Theorem H  T. N. Hibbard, 1962 . After a random element is deleted from a random tree by Algorithm D, the resulting tree is still random.  [Nonmathematical readers, please skip to  10 .] This statement of the theo- rem is admittedly quite vague. We can summarize the situation more precisely as follows: Let T be a tree of n elements, and let P T  be the probability that T occurs if its keys are inserted in random order by Algorithm T. Some trees are more probable than others. Let Q T  be the probability that T will occur if n+1 elements are inserted in random order by Algorithm T and then one of these elements is chosen at random and deleted by Algorithm D. In calculating P T , we assume that the n! permutations of the keys are equally likely; in calculating   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  433  Q T , we assume that the  n + 1 !  n + 1  permutations of keys and selections of the doomed key are equally likely. The theorem states that P T  = Q T  for all T. Proof. We are faced with the fact that permutations are equally probable, not trees, and therefore we shall prove the result by considering permutations as the random objects. We shall define a deletion from a permutation, and then we will prove that “a random element deleted from a random permutation leaves a random permutation.” Let a1 a2 . . . an+1 be a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n+1}; we want to define the operation of deleting ai, so as to obtain a permutation b1 b2 . . . bn of {1, 2, . . . , n}. This operation should correspond to Algorithms T and D, so that if we start with the tree constructed from the sequence of insertions a1, a2, . . . , an+1 and delete ai, renumbering the keys from 1 to n, we obtain the tree constructed from b1 b2 . . . bn.  It is not hard to define such a deletion operation. There are two cases: Case 1: ai = n + 1, or ai + 1 = aj for some j < i.  This is essentially the condition “RLINK ai  = Λ.”  Remove ai from the sequence, and subtract unity from each element greater than ai.  Case 2: ai + 1 = aj for some j > i. Replace ai by aj, remove aj from its  original place, and subtract unity from each element greater than ai.  For example, suppose we have the permutation 4 6 1 3 5 2. If we circle the  element to be deleted, we have   cid:107 4 6 1 3 5 2 = 4 5 1 3 2 4  cid:107 6 1 3 5 2 = 4 1 3 5 2 4 6  cid:107 1 3 5 2 = 3 5 1 2 4  4 6 1  cid:107 3 5 2 = 3 5 1 4 2 4 6 1 3  cid:107 5 2 = 4 5 1 3 2 4 6 1 3 5  cid:107 2 = 3 5 1 2 4  Since there are  n + 1 !  n + 1  possible deletion operations, the theorem will be established if we can show that every permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n} is the result of exactly  n + 1 2 deletions. Let b1 b2 . . . bn be a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. We shall define  n + 1 2 deletions, one for each pair i, j with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n + 1, as follows: If i < j, the deletion is b′1 . . . b′i−1   7  Here, as below, b′k stands for either bk or bk + 1, depending on whether or not bk is less than the circled element. This deletion corresponds to Case 2.   cid:109 bi b′i+1 . . . b′j−1  bi+1  b′j . . . b′n.  If i > j, the deletion is  this deletion fits the definition of Case 1.  Finally, if i = j, we have another Case 1 deletion, namely   cid:109 bj b′i . . . b′n;  cid:11   cid:8  cid:10   cid:9 n+1 b′i . . . b′n.  b′1 . . . b′i−1  b′1 . . . b′i−1   8    9    434  SEARCHING  6.2.2  As an example, let n = 4 and consider the 25 deletions that map into 3 1 4 2:  i = 1 cid:107 5 3 1 4 2  cid:107 3 4 1 5 2  cid:107 3 1 4 5 2  cid:107 3 1 5 4 2  cid:107 3 1 5 2 4  i = 2  4  cid:107 3 1 5 2 3  cid:107 5 1 4 2 4  cid:107 1 2 5 3 4  cid:107 1 5 2 3 4  cid:107 1 5 3 2  i = 3  4 1  cid:107 3 5 2 4 2  cid:107 1 5 3 3 1  cid:107 5 4 2 3 1  cid:107 4 5 2 3 1  cid:107 4 2 5  i = 4  4 1 5  cid:107 3 2 4 2 5  cid:107 1 3 3 1 5  cid:107 4 2 3 1 4  cid:107 5 2 4 1 5  cid:107 2 3  i = 5  4 1 5 2  cid:107 3 4 2 5 3  cid:107 1 3 1 5 2  cid:107 4 4 1 5 3  cid:107 2 3 1 4 2  cid:107 5  j = 1 j = 2 j = 3 j = 4 j = 5  The circled element is always in position i, and for fixed i we have con- structed n+1 different deletions, one for each j; hence  n+1 2 different deletions have been constructed for each permutation b1 b2 . . . bn. Since only  n + 1 2n! deletions are possible, we must have found all of them.  The proof of Theorem H not only tells us about the result of deletions, it also helps us analyze the running time in an average deletion. Exercise 12 shows that we can expect to execute step D2 slightly less than half the time, on the average, when deleting a random element from a random table.  Let us now consider how often the loop in step D3 needs to be performed: Suppose that we are deleting a node on level l, and that the external node immediately following in symmetric order is on level k. For example, if we are deleting CAPRICORN from Fig. 10, we have l = 0 and k = 3 since node 4 is on level 3. If k = l + 1, we have RLINK T  = Λ in step D1; and if k > l + 1, we will set S ← LLINK R  exactly k − l − 2 times in step D3. The average value of l is  internal path length  N; the average value of k is   external path length − distance to leftmost external node  N.  1   N  2 + 1  The distance to the leftmost external node is the number of left-to-right minima in the insertion sequence, so it has the average value HN by the analysis of Section 1.2.10. Since external path length minus internal path length is 2N, the average value of k − l − 2 is −HN  N. Adding to this the average number of times that k − l − 2 is −1, we see that the operation S ← LLINK R  in step D3 is performed only   10  times, on the average, in a random deletion. This is reassuring, since the worst case can be pretty slow  see exercise 11 .  Although Theorem H is rigorously true, in the precise form we have stated it, it cannot be applied, as we might expect, to a sequence of deletions followed by insertions. The shape of the tree is random after deletions, but the relative distribution of values in a given tree shape may change, and it turns out that the first random insertion after deletion actually destroys the randomness property on the shapes. This startling fact, first observed by Gary Knott in 1972, must be seen to be believed  see exercise 15 . Even more startling is the empirical evidence gathered by J. L. Eppinger [CACM 26  1983 , 663–669, 27  1984 ,  2 − HN   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  435  235], who found that the path length decreases slightly when a few random deletions and insertions are made, but then it increases until reaching a steady state after about N 2 deletion insertion operations have been performed. This steady state is worse than the behavior of a random tree, when N is greater than about 150. Further study by Culberson and Munro [Comp. J. 32  1989 , 68–75; Algorithmica 5  1990 , 295–311] has led to a plausible conjecture that  the average search time in the steady state is asymptotically2N 9π. However,  Eppinger also devised a simple modification that alternates between Algorithm D and a left-right reflection of the same algorithm; he found that this leads to an excellent steady state in which the path length is reduced to about 88% of its normal value for random trees. A theoretical explanation for this behavior is still lacking.  As mentioned above, Algorithm D does not test for the case LLINK T  = Λ, although this is one of the easy cases for deletion. We could add a new step between D1 and D2, namely, D1.5. [Is LLINK null?] If LLINK T  = Λ, set Q ← RLINK T  and go to D4. Exercise 14 shows that Algorithm D with this extra step always leaves a tree that is at least as good as the original Algorithm D, in the path-length sense, and sometimes the result is even better. When this idea is combined with Eppinger’s symmetric deletion strategy, the steady-state path length for repeated random deletion insertion operations decreases to about 86% of its insertion-only value. Frequency of access. So far we have assumed that each key was equally likely as a search argument. In a more general situation, let pk be the probability that we will search for the kth element inserted, where p1 + ··· + pN = 1. Then a straightforward modification of Eq.  2 , if we retain the assumption of random order so that the shape of the tree stays random and Eq.  5  holds, shows that the average number of comparisons in a successful search will be  N  k=1  N  k=1  1 +  pk 2Hk − 2  = 2  pkHk − 1.   11   For example, if the probabilities obey Zipf’s law, Eq. 6.1– 8 , the average  number of comparisons reduces to  HN − 1 + H   2  N  HN   12  if we insert the keys in decreasing order of importance.  See exercise 18.  This is about half as many comparisons as predicted by the equal-frequency analysis, and it is fewer than we would make using binary search.  Figure 12 shows the tree that results when the most common 31 words of English are entered in decreasing order of frequency. The relative frequency is shown with each word, using statistics from Cryptanalysis by H. F. Gaines  New York: Dover, 1956 , 226. The average number of comparisons for a successful search in this tree is 4.042; the corresponding binary search, using Algorithm 6.2.1B or 6.2.1C, would require 4.393 comparisons.   436  SEARCHING  6.2.2  Fig. 12. The 31 most common English words, inserted in decreasing order of frequency.  Optimum binary search trees. These considerations make it natural to ask about the best possible tree for searching a table of keys with given frequencies. For example, the optimum tree for the 31 most common English words is shown in Fig. 13; it requires only 3.437 comparisons for an average successful search. Let us now explore the problem of finding the optimum tree. When N = 3, let us assume that the keys K1 < K2 < K3 have respective  for example, probabilities p, q, r. There are five possible trees:   13   Figure 14 shows the ranges of p, q, r for which each tree is optimum; the balanced tree is best about 45 percent of the time, if we choose p, q, r at random  see exercise 21 .  Unfortunately, when N is large there are  2N    N   N + 1  ≈ 4N√  π N 3 2  binary trees, so we can’t just try them all and see which is best. Let us therefore study the properties of optimum binary search trees more closely, in order to discover a better way to find them.

An optimum search tree for the 31 most common English words.  Fig. 14. If the relative frequencies of  K1, K2, K3  are  p, q, r , this graph shows which of the five trees in  13  is best. The fact that p + q + r = 1 makes the graph two- dimensional although there are three coordinates.  So far we have considered only the probabilities for a successful search; in practice, the unsuccessful case must usually be considered as well. For example, the 31 words in Fig. 13 account for only about 36 percent of typical English text; the other 64 percent will certainly influence the structure of the optimum search tree.  Therefore let us set the problem up in the following way: We are given 2n+1  probabilities p1, p2, . . . , pn and q0, q1, . . . , qn, where  pi = probability that Ki is the search argument; qi = probability that the search argument lies between Ki and Ki+1.   By convention, q0 is the probability that the search argument is less than K1, and qn is the probability that the search argument is greater than Kn.

Thus the expected number of comparisons for the binary tree  where  cid:107 j   15   is 2q0 + 2p1 + 3q1 + 3p2 + 3q2 + p3 + q3. Let us call this the cost of the tree; and let us say that a minimum-cost tree is optimum. In this definition there is no need to require that the p’s and q’s sum to unity; we can ask for a minimum-cost tree with any given sequence of “weights”  p1, . . . , pn; q0, . . . , qn .  We have studied Huffman’s procedure for constructing trees with minimum weighted path length, in Section 2.3.4.5; but that method requires all the p’s to be zero, and the tree it produces will usually not have the external node weights  q0, . . . , qn  in the proper symmetric order from left to right. Therefore we need another approach.  What saves us is that all subtrees of an optimum tree are optimum. For example, if  15  is an optimum tree for the weights  p1, p2, p3; q0, q1, q2, q3 , then the left subtree of the root must be optimum for  p1, p2; q0, q1, q2 ; any improvement to a subtree leads to an improvement in the whole tree.  This principle suggests a computation procedure that systematically finds larger and larger optimum subtrees. We have used much the same idea in Sec- tion 5.4.9 to construct optimum merge patterns; the general approach is known as “dynamic programming,” and we shall consider it further in Section 7.7. Let c i, j  be the cost of an optimum subtree with weights  pi+1, . . . , pj; qi, . . . , qj ; and let w i, j  = pi+1 +··· + pj + qi +··· + qj be the sum of all those weights; thus c i, j  and w i, j  are defined for 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n. It follows that  c i, k−1  + c k, j ,  c i, i  = 0, c i, j  = w i, j  + min i<k≤j  since the minimum possible cost of a tree with root  cid:107 k is w i, j  + c i, k−1  +  c k, j . When i < j, let R i, j  be the set of all k for which the minimum is achieved in  16 ; this set specifies the possible roots of the optimum trees. Equation  16  makes it possible to evaluate c i, j  for j − i = 1, 2, . . . , n; 2 n2 such values, and the minimization operation is carried out  there are about 1  for i < j,   16   3  1  3  0  2  1  2   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  439  for about 1 O n3  units of time, using O n2  cells of memory.  6 n3 values of k. This means we can determine an optimum tree in A factor of n can actually be removed from the running time if we make use of a monotonicity property. Let r i, j  denote an element of R i, j ; we need not compute the entire set R i, j , a single representative is sufficient. Once we have found r i, j−1  and r i+1, j , the result of exercise 27 proves that we may always assume that  r i, j−1  ≤ r i, j  ≤ r i+1, j    17  when the weights are nonnegative. This limits the search for the minimum, since only r i+1, j  − r i, j−1  + 1 values of k need to be examined in  16  instead of j−i. The total amount of work when j−i = d is now bounded by the telescoping  r i+1, j  − r i, j−1  + 1 = r n−d+1, n  − r 0, d−1  + n − d + 1 < 2n;  series  d≤j≤n i=j−d hence the total running time is reduced to O n2 .  The following algorithm describes this procedure in detail.  Algorithm K  Find optimum binary search trees . Given 2n + 1 nonnegative weights  p1, . . . , pn; q0, . . . , qn , this algorithm constructs binary trees t i, j  that have minimum cost for the weights  pi+1, . . . , pj; qi, . . . , qj  in the sense defined above. Three arrays are computed, namely  c[i, j], r[i, j], w[i, j],  for 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, for 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n, for 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n,  the cost of t i, j ; the root of t i, j ; the total weight of t i, j .  The results of the algorithm are specified by the r array: If i = j, t i, j  is null; otherwise its left subtree is t i, r[i, j]−1  and its right subtree is t r[i, j], j . K1. [Initialize.] For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, set c[i, i] ← 0 and w[i, i] ← qi and w[i, j] ← w[i, j−1] + pj + qj for j = i + 1, . . . , n. Then for 1 ≤ j ≤ n set c[j−1, j] ← w[j−1, j] and r[j−1, j] ← j.  This determines all the 1-node optimum trees.   K2. [Loop on d.] Do step K3 for d = 2, 3, . . . , n, then terminate the algorithm. K3.

The titles of all articles in the   440  SEARCHING  6.2.2  first ten volumes of the Journal of the ACM were sorted to prepare a concordance in which there was one line for every word of every title. However, certain words like “THE” and “EQUATION” were felt to be sufficiently uninformative that they were left out of the index. These special words and their frequency of occurrence are shown in the internal nodes of Fig. 15. Notice that a title such as “On the solution of an equation for a certain new problem” would be so uninformative, it wouldn’t appear in the index at all! The idea of KWIC indexing is due to H. P. Luhn, Amer. Documentation 11  1960 , 288–295.  See W. W. Youden, JACM 10  1963 , 583–646, where the full KWIC index appears.   Fig. 15. An optimum binary search tree for a KWIC indexing application.  When preparing a KWIC index file for sorting, we might want to use a binary search tree in order to test whether or not each particular word is to be indexed. The other words fall between two of the unindexed words, with the frequencies shown in the external nodes of Fig. 15; thus, exactly 277 words that are alphabetically between “PROBLEMS” and “SOLUTION” appeared in the JACM titles during 1954–1963.  Figure 15 shows the optimum tree obtained by Algorithm K, with n = 35. The computed values of r[0, j] for j = 1, 2, . . . , 35 are  1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 11, 11, . . . , 11, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21 ; the values of r[i, 35] for i = 0, 1, . . . , 34 are  21, 21, . . . , 21, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 26, 26, 26, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 33, 33, 33, 35, 35 .  The “betweenness frequencies” qj have a noticeable effect on the optimum tree structure; Fig. 16 a  shows the optimum tree that would have been obtained with the qj set to zero. Similarly, the internal frequencies pi are important; Fig. 16 b  shows the optimum tree when the pi are set to zero. Considering the full set of frequencies, the tree of Fig. 15 requires only 4.15 comparisons, on the average, while the trees of Fig. 16 require, respectively, 4.69 and 4.72.  6 6 2  F O  8 5  D N A  2 4 1  A  5 3  0  N A  5  S A  9 2 1  R O F  2 5  N I  4  M O R F  5 1  N O I T A U Q E  3 2  S N O I T A U Q E  0  8 9  7 2  3 1 1  9  S N O I T A T U P M O C  N I A T R E C  0 2  Y B  4 3 3  5  0 1  N O I T A T U P M O C  8 3 5  5  S T I  8 3  D O H T E M  S D O H T E M  9  W E N  9 8  0 8 1  8 1  2  S E T O N  7  4  0  2 6  E T O N  G N I N I A T B O  2 0 1  7 0 3  7 2  N O I T U L O S  1 1  7 7 2  E M O S  0 1  0 7 1  E V L O S  0  S N O I T U L O S  8 1  S M E L B O R P  3 9  N O  3  5  T R A P  8 1  4 6  M E L B O R P  0 8 1  E H T  2 3  O T  1 2  E S U  1 2  H T I W  R I E H T  6 7  9 2  H C I H W  5  4  3  5 5  7 2  6 3  5 8  1 3  0 0 7  0 0  0  8 1  7 3 2   BINARY TREE SEARCHING  441  6.2.2  a   b   Fig. 16. Optimum binary search trees based on half of the data of Fig. 15:  a  external frequencies suppressed;  b  internal frequencies suppressed.  Since Algorithm K requires time and space proportional to n2, it becomes impractical when n is very large. Of course we may not really want to use binary search trees for large n, in view of the other search techniques to be discussed later in this chapter; but let’s assume anyway that we want to find an optimum or nearly optimum tree when n is large.  We have seen that the idea of inserting the keys in order of decreasing frequency can tend to make a fairly good tree, on the average; but it can also be very bad  see exercise 20 , and it is not usually very near the optimum, since it makes no use of the qj weights. Another approach is to choose the root k so that  the resulting maximum subtree weight, maxw 0, k−1 , w k, n , is as small as  possible. This approach can also be fairly poor, because it may choose a node with very small pk to be the root; however, Theorem M below shows that the resulting tree will not be extremely far from the optimum.  6 6 2  F O  8 3  D O H T E M  2 5  N I  M O R F  S T I  8 1  S D O H T E M  9  W E N  4  5  7  3 9  N O  8 1  M E L B O R P  T R A P  7 2  N O I T U L O S  S M E L B O R P  S N O I T U L O S  4  5  8 1  5  E T O N  2  S E T O N  G N I N I A T B O  0 8 1  E H T  0 1  E V L O S  1 1  E M O S  1 2  E S U  1 2  H T I W  2 3  O T  4  3  R I E H T  H C I H W  2 4 1  A  5 3  N A  8 5  D N A  0 2  Y B  5  S A  9 2 1  R O F  3 2  S N O I T A U Q E  5 1  N O I T A U Q E  S N O I T A T U P M O C  5  9  0 1  N O I T A T U P M O C  N I A T R E C  D O H T E M  S A  4 3 3  N O  N A  Y B  R O F  3 1 1  9 8  0 8 1  W E N  A  D N A  5 8  0  5 5  7 2  6 3  1 3  N I A T R E C  S N O I T A U Q E  0  8 9  N I  S T I  M O R F  7 2  N O I T A U Q E  S N O I T A T U P M O C  N O I T A T U P M O C  8 3 5  S E T O N  S D O H T E M  0  2 6  E T O N  2 0 1  7 3  F O  G N I N I A T B O  0 3  N O I T U L O S  E M O S  E V L O S  S N O I T U L O S  S M E L B O R P  7 7 2  T R A P  M E L B O R P  4 6  0  E H T  E S U  0 7 1  O T  H T I W  R I E H T  6 7  9 2  H C I H W  0 0 7  0 0  0  8 1  7 3 2   442  SEARCHING  6.2.2  Fig. 17. Behavior of the cost as a function of the root, k.  A more satisfactory procedure can be obtained by combining these two methods, as suggested by W. A. Walker and C. C. Gotlieb [Graph Theory and Computing  Academic Press, 1972 , 303–323]: Try to equalize the left-hand and right-hand weights, but be prepared to move the root a few steps to the left or right to find a node with relatively large pk. Figure 17 shows why this method is reasonable: If we plot c 0, k−1  + c k, n  as a function of k, for the KWIC data of Fig. 15, we see that the result is quite sensitive to the magnitude of pk.  A top-down method such as this can be used for large n to choose the root and then to work on the left and the right subtrees. When we get down to a sufficiently small subtree we can apply Algorithm K. The resulting method yields fairly good trees  reportedly within 2 or 3 percent of the optimum , and it requires only O n  units of space, O n log n  units of time. In fact, M. Fredman has shown that O n  units of time suffice, if suitable data structures are used [STOC 7  1975 , 240–244]; see K. Mehlhorn, Data Structures and Algorithms 1  Springer, 1984 , Section 4.2. Optimum trees and entropy. The minimum cost is closely related to a mathematical concept called entropy, which was introduced by Claude Shannon in his seminal work on information theory [Bell System Tech. J. 27  1948 , 379– 423, 623–656]. If p1, p2, . . . , pn are probabilities with p1 + p2 + ··· + pn = 1, we define the entropy H p1, p2, . . . , pn  by the formula  H p1, p2, . . . , pn  =   18   n  k=1  pk lg 1  .  pk  Intuitively, if n events are possible and the kth event occurs with probability pk, we can imagine that we have received lg 1 pk  bits of information when the kth  c 0, k−1  + c k, n  +w 0, n   w 0, n   k  t o o r  h t i w e e r t  a  f o  t s o c  e g a r e v a m u m n M  i  i  5.1  5.0  4.9  4.8  4.7  4.6  4.5  4.4  4.3  4.2  4.1  4.0  1  3  5  7  9  0 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35  pk  300  k p  200  100  , y c n e u q e r F   6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  443  event has occurred.  An event of probability 1 32 gives 5 bits of information, etc.  Then H p1, p2, . . . , pn  is the expected number of bits of information in a random event. If pk = 0, we define pk lg 1 pk  = 0, because  ϵ lg 1  ϵ  lim ϵ→0+  = lim m→∞  1 m  lg m = 0.  This convention allows us to use  18  when some of the probabilities are zero. The function x lg 1 x  is concave; that is, its second derivative, −1  x ln 2 , is negative. Therefore the maximum value of H p1, p2, . . . , pn  occurs when p1 = p2 = ··· = pn = 1 n, namely   19  In general, if we specify p1, . . . , pn−k but allow the other probabilities pn−k+1, . . . , pn to vary, we have  = lg n.  , . . . ,  H  n  ,   1  1 n    1 n  H p1, . . . , pn−k, pn−k+1, . . . , pn  ≤ H  p1, . . . , pn−k,  , . . . ,  q k  = H p1, . . . , pn−k, q  + q lg k, H p1, . . . , pn−k, pn−k+1, . . . , pn  ≥ H p1, . . . , pn−k, q, 0, . . . , 0   = H p1, . . . , pn−k, q ,  where q = 1 −  p1 + ··· + pn−k . assigned to the leaves, say  Consider any not-necessarily-binary tree in which probabilities have been    q k     20    21    22   Here pk represents the probability that a search procedure will end at leaf k .

The sum of p α H α  over all internal nodes α of a tree, where p α  is the probability of reaching node α and H α  is the entropy of α, equals the entropy of the probability distribution on the leaves. Proof. It is easy to establish this identity by induction from bottom to top. For example, we have H A + p1+p2+p3+p4 H B +p2 H C + p3+p4 H D + p6+p7+p8+p9 H E   = p1 lg 1  + p2 lg 1  + ··· + p9 lg 1  p1  p2  p9  with respect to the formulas above; all terms involving lg p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 , lg p3 + p4 , and lg p6 + p7 + p8 + p9  cancel out.  As a consequence of Lemma E, we can use entropy to establish a convenient  lower bound on the cost of any binary tree. Theorem B. Let  p1, . . . , pn; q0, . . . , qn  be nonnegative weights as in Algo- rithm K, normalized so that p1+···+pn+q0+···+qn = 1, and let P = p1+···+pn be the probability of a successful search. Let  H = H p1, . . . , pn, q0, . . . , qn   be the entropy of the corresponding probability distribution, and let C be the minimum cost,  14 .

Equation  23  does not necessarily hold when the entropy is extremely low. But the restriction to cases where H ≥ 2P e is not severe, since the value of H is usually near lg n; see exercise 37. Notice that the proof doesn’t actually use the left-to-right order of the nodes; the lower bound  23  holds for any binary search tree that has internal node probabilities pj and external node probabilities qk in any order.  Entropy calculations also yield an upper bound that is not too far from  23 ,  even when we do stick to the left-to-right order: Theorem M. Under the assumptions of Theorem B, we also have  C ≤ H + 2 − P. 2 q0, s1 = q0+p1+ 1   25  Proof. Form the n+1 sums s0 = 1 2 q2, . . . , sn = q0 + p1 +···+ qn−1 + pn + 1 2 qn; we may assume that s0 < s1 < ··· < sn  see exercise 38 .

Therefore Theorem B tells us that C ≥ 3.3800, and Theorem M tells us that C < 6.6098. *The Garsia–Wachs algorithm. An amazing improvement on Algorithm K is possible in the special case that p1 = ··· = pn = 0. This case, in which only the leaf probabilities  q0, q1, . . . , qn  are relevant, is especially important because it arises in several significant applications. Let us therefore assume in the remainder of this section that the probabilities pj are zero.

If qk−1 = Lemma W. qk+1 then lk ≤ lk+1 in some optimum tree. Proof. Suppose qk−1 ≥ qk+1 and consider a tree in which lk > lk+1. Then k must be a right child, and its left sibling L is a subtree of weight w ≥ qk−1. Replace the parent of k by L; replace k+1 by a node whose children are k and k+1 . This changes the overall cost by −w − qk lk − lk+1 − 1  + qk+1 ≤ qk+1− qk−1. So the given tree was not optimum if qk−1 > qk+1, and an optimum tree has been transformed into another optimum tree if qk−1 = qk+1. In the latter case we have found an optimum tree in which lk = lk+1.  A deeper analysis of the structure tells us considerably more.  is a left child.  Lemma X. Suppose j and k are indices such that j < k and we have i  qi−1 > qi+1 for 1 ≤ i < k; ii  qk−1 ≤ qk+1; iii  qi < qk−1 + qk for j ≤ i < k − 1; and iv  qj−1 ≥ qk−1 + qk. Then there is an optimum tree in which lk−1 = lk and either a  lj = lk − 1, or b  lj = lk and j Proof. By reversing left and right in Lemma W, we see that  ii  implies the existence of an optimum tree in which lk−1 ≥ lk. But Lemma W and  i  also imply that l1 ≤ l2 ≤ ··· ≤ lk. Therefore lk−1 = lk. Suppose ls < lk − 1 ≤ ls+1 for some s with j ≤ s < k − 1. Let t be the smallest index < k such that lt = lk. Then li = lk − 1 for s < i < t, and s+1 is a left child; possibly s + 1 = t. Furthermore t and t+1 are siblings. i by i+1 for s < i < t; and replace Replace their parent by t+1 ; replace s and s+1 . s by an internal node whose children are the external node This change increases the cost by ≤ qs − qt − qt+1 ≤ qs − qk−1 − qk, so it is an improvement if qs < qk−1 + qk. Therefore, by  iii , lj ≥ lk − 1. is not a left If lj = lk and j j−1 . Replace their parent by j−1 ; child, then replace leaf for j < i < k; and replace the external node k by an internal node whose children are k−1 and k . The cost increases by −qj−1 + qk−1 + qk ≤ 0, so we obtain an optimum tree satisfying  a  or  b . Lemma Y. Let j and k be as in Lemma X, and consider the modified probabil- ities  q′0, . . . , q′n−1  =  q0, . . . , qj−1, qk−1 + qk, qj, . . . , qk−2, qk+1, . . . , qn  obtained by removing qk−1 and qk and inserting qk−1 + qk after qj−1.

If it is of type  b , we simply rename the leaves, sliding k−1 and k to the left by k − 1 − j places. If it is of type  a , suppose ls−1 = lk − 1 and ls = lk; we proceed as follows: First slide k−1 and k left by k − 1− s places; then replace their  new  parent by s−1 ; finally replace j by a node whose children are k−1 and k , and replace node i by i−1 for j < i < s. Lemma Z. Under the hypotheses of Lemma Y, equality holds in  29 . Proof. Every tree for  q′0, . . . , q′n−1  corresponds to a tree with leaves  30  in which the two out-of-order leaf nodes k−1 and k are siblings. Let internal  node  cid:107 x be their parent. We want to show that any optimum tree of that type can be converted to a tree of the same cost in which the leaves appear in normal order 0 . . . n . lx ≤ lj ≤ ··· ≤ lk−2, where lx is the level of  cid:107 x and li is the level of There is nothing to prove if j = k − 1. Otherwise we have q′i−1 > q′i+1 for j ≤ i < k − 1. If lx = lk−2, we simply slide node  cid:107 x to the right, replacing the j ≤ i   qj. Therefore by Lemma W we have sequence  cid:107 x . . . k−2  cid:107 x ; this straightens out the leaves for Otherwise suppose ls = lx and ls+1 > lx. We first replace  cid:107 x s  cid:107 x ; this makes l ≤ ls+1 ≤ ··· ≤ lk−2, where l = lx + 1 is the  by j common level of nodes k−1 and k . Finally replace nodes  . . . k−2 by j  as desired.  . . .  . . .  s  j  j  i  k−1 by the cyclically shifted sequence  s+1 . . . k−2  k  s+1 . . . k−2  k−1  k .  Exercise 40 proves that these changes decrease the cost, unless lk−2 = l. But the cost cannot decrease, because of Lemma Y. Therefore lk−2 = l, and the proof is complete.  These lemmas show that the problem for n + 1 weights q0, q1, . . . , qn can be reduced to an n-weight problem: We first find the smallest index k with qk−1 ≤ qk+1; then we find the largest j < k with qj−1 ≥ qk−1 + qk; then we remove qk−1 and qk from the list, and insert the sum qk−1 + qk just after qj−1. In the special cases j = 0 or k = n, the proofs show that we should proceed as if infinite weights q−1 and qn+1 were present at the left and right. The proofs also show that any optimum tree T ′ that is obtained from the new weights  q′0, . . . , q′n−1  can be rearranged into a tree T that has the original weights  q0, . . . , qn  in the correct left-to-right order; moreover, each weight will appear at the same level in both T and T ′.  For example, Fig. 18 illustrates the construction when the weights qk are the relative frequencies of the characters ␣, A, B, . . . , Z in English text. The first few weights are  186, 64, 13, 22, 32, 103, . . .   4 5 0  S E A R C H N G  I  6 . 2 . 2  Fig. 19.

In the new sequence  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  we replace “35, 32” by 67 and slide 67 to the left of 64, obtaining  186, 64, 35, 32, 103, . . .  186, 67, 64, 103, . . . .  Then “67, 64” becomes 131, and we begin to examine the weights that follow 103. After the 27 original weights have been combined into the single weight 1000, the history of successive combinations specifies a binary tree whose weighted path length is the solution to the original problem.  binary tree with n internal nodes for whichn  But the leaves of the tree in Fig. 18 are not at all in the correct order, because they get tangled up when we slide qk−1 + qk to the left  see exercise 41 . Still, the proof of Lemma Z guarantees that there is a tree whose leaves are in the correct order and on exactly the same levels as in the tangled tree. This untangled tree, Fig. 19, is therefore optimum; it is the binary tree output by the Garsia–Wachs algorithm. Algorithm G  Garsia–Wachs algorithm for optimum binary trees . Given a sequence of nonnegative weights w0, w1, . . . , wn, this algorithm constructs a k=0 wklk is minimum, where lk is the distance of external node k from the root. It uses an array of 2n + 2 nodes whose addresses are Xk for 0 ≤ k ≤ 2n + 1; each node has four fields called WT, LLINK, RLINK, and LEVEL. The leaves of the constructed tree will be nodes X0 . . . Xn; the internal nodes will be Xn+1 . . . X2n; the root will be X2n; and X2n+1 is used as a temporary sentinel. The algorithm also maintains a working array of pointers P0, P1, . . . , Pt, where t ≤ n + 1. G1. [Begin phase 1.] Set WT Xk  ← wk and LLINK Xk  ← RLINK Xk  ← Λ for 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Also set P0 ← X2n+1, WT P0  ← ∞, P1 ← X0, t ← 1, m ← n. Then perform step G2 for r = 1, 2, . . . , n, and go to G3. G2. [Absorb wr.]  At this point we have the basic condition for 1 ≤ i < t;   31  in other words, the weights in the working array are “2-descending.”  If WT Pt−1  ≤ wr, set k ← t, perform Subroutine C below, and repeat step G2. Otherwise set t ← t + 1 and Pt ← Xr. G3. [Finish phase 1.] While t > 1, set k ← t and perform Subroutine C below. G4. [Do phase 2.]  Now P1 = X2n is the root of a binary tree, and WT P1  = w0+···+wn.  Set lk to the distance of node Xk from node P1, for 0 ≤ k ≤ n.  See exercise 43. An example is shown in Fig. 18, where level numbers appear at the right of each node.   WT Pi−1  > WT Pi+1   G5. [Do phase 3.] By changing the links of Xn+1, . . . , X2n, construct a new binary tree having the same level numbers lk, but with the leaf nodes in symmetric order X0, . . . , Xn.  See exercise 44; an example appears in Fig. 19.    452  SEARCHING  6.2.2  Subroutine C  Combination . This recursive subroutine is the heart of the Garsia–Wachs algorithm. It combines two weights, shifts them left as appropri- ate, and maintains the 2-descending condition  31 . Variables j and w are local, but variables k, m, and t are global. C1. [Create a new node.]   At this point we have k ≥ 2.  Set m ← m + 1, LLINK Xm  ← Pk−1, RLINK Xm  ← Pk, WT Xm  ← w ← WT Pk−1 +WT Pk . C2. [Shift the following nodes left.] Set t ← t− 1, then Pj ← Pj+1 for k ≤ j ≤ t. C3. [Shift the preceding nodes right.] Set j ← k − 2; then while WT Pj  < w set C4. [Insert the new node.] Set Pj+1 ← Xm. C5. [Done?] If j = 0 or WT Pj−1  > w, exit the subroutine. C6. [Restore  31 .] Set k ← j, j ← t−j, and call Subroutine C recursively. Then  Pj+1 ← Pj and j ← j − 1.  reset j ← t − j  note that t may have changed!  and return to step C5. Subroutine C might need Ω n  steps to create and insert a new node, because it uses sequential memory instead of linked lists. Therefore the total running time of Algorithm G might be Ω n2 . But more elaborate data structures can be used to guarantee that phase 1 will require at most O n log n  steps  see exercise 45 . Phases 2 and 3 need only O n  steps.  Kleitman and Saks [SIAM J. Algeb. Discr. Methods 2  1981 , 142–146] proved that the optimum weighted path length never exceeds the value of the optimum weighted path length that occurs when the q’s have been rearranged in “sawtooth order”:  q0 ≤ q2 ≤ q4 ≤ ··· ≤ q2⌊n 2⌋  ≤ q2⌈n 2⌉−1 ≤ ··· ≤ q3 ≤ q1 .   32   This is the inverse of the organ-pipe order discussed in exercise 6.1–18.  In the latter case the Garsia–Wachs algorithm essentially reduces to Huffman’s algorithm on the weights q0 + q1, q2 + q3, . . . , because the weights in the working array will actually be nonincreasing  not merely “2-descending” as in  31  . Therefore we can improve the upper bound of Theorem M without knowing the order of the weights.  The optimum binary tree in Fig. 19 has an important application to coding theory as well as to searching: Using 0 to stand for a left branch in the tree and 1 to stand for a right branch, we obtain the following variable-length codewords:  ␣ 00 A 0100 B 010100 C 010101 D 01011 E 0110 F 011100 G 011101 H 01111  I 1000 J 1001000 K 1001001 L 100101 M 10011 N 1010 O 1011 P 110000 Q 110001  R 11001 S 1101 T 1110 U 111100 V 111101 W 111110 X 11111100 Y 11111101 Z 1111111   33    6.2.2  BINARY TREE SEARCHING  453  Thus a message like “RIGHT ON” would be encoded by the string  1100110000111010111111100010111010.  Decoding from left to right is easy, in spite of the variable length of the codewords, because the tree structure tells us when one codeword ends and another begins. This method of coding preserves the alphabetical order of messages, and it uses an average of about 4.2 bits per letter. Thus the code could be used to compress data files, without destroying lexicographic order of alphabetic information.  The figure of 4.2 bits per letter is minimum over all binary tree codes, although it could be reduced to 4.1 bits per letter if we disregarded the alphabetic ordering constraint. A further reduction, preserving alphabetic order, could be achieved if pairs of letters instead of single letters were encoded.  History and bibliography. The tree search methods of this section were discovered independently by several people during the 1950s. In an unpublished memorandum dated August 1952, A. I. Dumey described a primitive form of tree insertion in the following way:  Consider a drum with 2n item storages in it, each having a binary address.  1. Read in the first item and store it in address 2n−1, i.e., at the  Follow this program:  halfway storage place.  2. Read in the next item. Compare it with the first. 3. If it is larger, put it in address 2n−1 + 2n−2. If it is smaller, put it  at 2n−2. . . .  Another early form of tree insertion was introduced by D. J. Wheeler, who actually allowed multiway branching similar to what we shall discuss in Section 6.2.4; and a binary tree insertion technique was devised by C. M. Berners-Lee [see Comp. J. 2  1959 , 5].  The first published descriptions of tree insertion were by P. F. Windley [Comp. J. 3  1960 , 84–88], A. D. Booth and A. J. T. Colin [Information and Control 3  1960 , 327–334], and Thomas N. Hibbard [JACM 9  1962 , 13–28]. Each of these authors seems to have developed the method independently of the others, and each paper derived the average number of comparisons  6  in a different way. The individual authors also went on to treat different aspects of the algorithm: Windley gave a detailed discussion of tree insertion sorting; Booth and Colin discussed the effect of preconditioning by making the first 2n−1 elements form a perfectly balanced tree  see exercise 4 ; Hibbard introduced the idea of deletion and showed the connection between the analysis of tree insertion and the analysis of quicksort. The idea of optimum binary search trees was first developed for the special case p1 = ··· = pn = 0, in the context of alphabetic binary encodings like  33 . A very interesting paper by E. N. Gilbert and E. F. Moore [Bell System Tech. J. 38  1959 , 933–968] discussed this problem and its relation to other coding problems. Gilbert and Moore proved Theorem M in the special case   454  SEARCHING  6.2.2  P = 0, and observed that an optimum tree could be constructed in O n3  steps, using a method like Algorithm K but without making use of the monotonicity relation  17 . K. E. Iverson [A Programming Language  Wiley, 1962 , 142–144] independently considered the other case, when all the q’s are zero. He suggested that an optimum tree would be obtained if the root is chosen so as to equalize the left and right subtree probabilities as much as possible; unfortunately we have seen that this idea doesn’t work. D. E. Knuth [Acta Informatica 1  1971 , 14–25, 270] subsequently considered the case of general p and q weights and proved that the algorithm could be reduced to O n2  steps; he also presented an example from a compiler application, where the keys in the tree are “reserved words” in an ALGOL-like language. T. C. Hu had been studying his own algorithm for the case pj = 0 for several years; a rigorous proof of the validity of that algorithm was difficult to find because of the complexity of the problem, but he eventually obtained a proof jointly with A. C. Tucker [SIAM J. Applied Math. 21  1971 , 514–532]. Simplifications leading to Algorithm G were found several years later by A. M. Garsia and M. L. Wachs, SICOMP 6  1977 , 622–642, although their proof was still rather complicated. Lemmas W, X, Y, and Z above are due to J. H. Kingston, J. Algorithms 9  1988 , 129–136. Further properties have been found by M. Karpinski, L. L. Larmore, and W. Rytter, Theoretical Comp. Sci. 180  1997 , 309–324. See also the paper by Hu, Kleitman, and Tamaki, SIAM J. Applied Math. 37  1979 , 246–256, for an elementary proof of the Hu–Tucker algorithm and some generalizations to other cost functions.  Theorem B is due to Paul J. Bayer, report MIT LCS TM-69  Mass. Inst. of Tech., 1975 , who also proved a slightly weaker form of Theorem M. The stronger form above is due to K. Mehlhorn, SICOMP 6  1977 , 235–239.  EXERCISES 1.

[M41] In order to find the binary search tree that minimizes the running time of Program T, we should minimize the quantity 7C + C1 instead of simply minimizing the number of comparisons C. Develop an algorithm that finds optimum binary search trees when different costs are associated with left and right branches in the tree.  Incidentally, when the right cost is twice the left cost, and the node frequencies are all equal, the Fibonacci trees turn out to be optimum; see L. E. Stanfel, JACM 17  1970 , 508–517. On machines that cannot make three-way comparisons at once, a program for Algorithm T will have to make two comparisons in step T2, one for equality and one for less-than; B. Sheil and V. R. Pratt have observed that these comparisons need not involve the same key, and it may well be best to have a binary tree whose internal nodes specify either an equality test or a less-than test but not both. This situation would be interesting to explore as an alternative to the stated problem.  34.

Balanced Trees The tree insertion algorithm we have just learned will produce good search trees, when the input data is random, but there is still the annoying possibility that a degenerate tree will occur. Perhaps we could devise an algorithm that keeps the tree optimum at all times; but unfortunately that seems to be very difficult. Another idea is to keep track of the total path length, and to reorganize the tree completely whenever its path length exceeds 5N lg N, say. But such an approach  might require aboutN 2 reorganizations as the tree is being built.   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  459  A very pretty solution to the problem of maintaining a good search tree was discovered in 1962 by two Russian mathematicians, G. M. Adelson-Velsky and E. M. Landis [Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR 146  1962 , 263–266; English trans- lation in Soviet Math. Doklady 3  1962 , 1259–1263]. Their method requires only two extra bits per node, and it never uses more than O log N  operations to search the tree or to insert an item. In fact, we shall see that their approach also leads to a general technique that is good for representing arbitrary linear lists of length N, so that each of the following operations can be done in only O log N  units of time:  i  Find an item having a given key. ii  Find the kth item, given k. iii  Insert an item at a specified place. iv  Delete a specified item. If we use sequential allocation for linear lists, operations  i  and  ii  are efficient but operations  iii  and  iv  take order N steps; on the other hand, if we use linked allocation, operations  iii  and  iv  are efficient but operations  i  and  ii  take order N steps. A tree representation of linear lists can do all four operations in O log N  steps. And it is also possible to do other standard operations with comparable efficiency, so that, for example, we can concatenate a list of  M elements with a list of N elements in Olog M + N  steps.  The method for achieving all this involves what we shall call balanced trees.  Many authors also call them AVL trees, where the AV stands for Adelson-Velsky and the L stands for Landis.  The preceding paragraph is an advertisement for balanced trees, which makes them sound like a universal panacea that makes all other forms of data representation obsolete; but of course we ought to have a balanced attitude about balanced trees! In applications that do not involve all four of the operations above, we may be able to get by with substantially less overhead and simpler programming. Furthermore, there is no advantage to bal- anced trees unless N is reasonably large; thus if we have an efficient method that takes 64 lg N units of time and an inefficient method that takes 2N units of time, we should use the inefficient method unless N is greater than 256. On the other hand, N shouldn’t be too large, either; balanced trees are appropriate chiefly for internal storage of data, and we shall study better methods for external direct- access files in Section 6.2.4. Since internal memories seem to be getting larger and larger as time goes by, balanced trees are becoming more and more important. The height of a tree is defined to be its maximum level, the length of the longest path from the root to an external node. A binary tree is called balanced if the height of the left subtree of every node never differs by more than ±1 from the height of its right subtree. Figure 20 shows a balanced tree with 17 internal nodes and height 5; the balance factor within each node is shown as +,   , or − according as the right subtree height minus the left subtree height is +1, 0, or −1. The Fibonacci tree in Fig. 8  Section 6.2.1  is another balanced binary tree of height 5, having only 12 internal nodes; most of the balance factors in that tree   460  SEARCHING  6.2.3  Fig. 20. A balanced binary tree.  are −1. The zodiac tree in Fig. 10  Section 6.2.2  is not balanced, because the height restriction on subtrees fails at both the AQUARIUS and GEMINI nodes.  This definition of balance represents a compromise between optimum binary trees  with all external nodes required to be on two adjacent levels  and arbitrary binary trees  unrestricted . It is therefore natural to ask how far from optimum a balanced tree can be. The answer is that its search paths will never be more than 45 percent longer than the optimum: Theorem A  Adelson-Velsky and Landis . The height of a balanced tree with N internal nodes always lies between lg N + 1  and 1.4405 lg N + 2  − 0.3277. Proof. A binary tree of height h obviously cannot have more than 2h external  nodes; so N + 1 ≤ 2h, that is, h ≥lg N + 1  in any binary tree.  In order to find the maximum value of h, let us turn the problem around and ask for the minimum number of nodes possible in a balanced tree of height h. Let Th be such a tree with fewest possible nodes; then one of the subtrees of the root, say the left subtree, has height h − 1, and the other subtree has height h−1 or h−2. Since we want Th to have the minimum number of nodes, we may assume that the left subtree of the root is Th−1, and that the right subtree is Th−2. This argument shows that the Fibonacci tree of order h + 1 has the fewest possible nodes among all possible balanced trees of height h.  See the definition of Fibonacci trees in Section 6.2.1.  Thus  N ≥ Fh+2 − 1 > ϕh+2√  5 − 2,  and the stated result follows as in the corollary to Theorem 4.5.3F.  The proof of this theorem shows that a search in a balanced tree will require more than 25 comparisons only if the tree contains at least F28 − 1 = 317,810 nodes. Consider now what happens when a new node is inserted into a balanced In Fig. 20, the tree will still be 4 , 7 , 10 , or 13 , but  tree using tree insertion  Algorithm 6.2.2T . balanced if the new node takes the place of  6 ,  5 ,  F  +  K  H  +  N  5  G  −  J  −  M  P  −  D  E  4  B  1  C  2  A  0  3  6  7  I  10  L  13  O  Q  8  9  11  12  14  15  16  17   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  461  some adjustment will be needed if the new node falls elsewhere. The problem arises when we have a node with a balance factor of +1 whose right subtree got higher after the insertion; or, dually, if the balance factor is −1 and the left subtree got higher. It is not difficult to see that trouble arises only in two cases:  Case 1  Case 2   1    Two other essentially identical cases occur if we reflect these diagrams, inter- changing left and right.  In these diagrams the large rectangles α, β, γ, δ represent subtrees having the respective heights shown. Case 1 occurs when a new element has just increased the height of node B’s right subtree from h to h + 1, and Case 2 occurs when the new element has increased the height of B’s left subtree. In the second case, we have either h = 0  so that X itself was the new node , or else node X has two subtrees of respective heights  h−1, h  or  h, h−1 .  Simple transformations will restore balance in both of these cases, while  preserving the symmetric order of the tree nodes:  Case 1  Case 2   2   In Case 1 we simply “rotate” the tree to the left, attaching β to A instead of B. This transformation is like applying the associative law to an algebraic formula, replacing α βγ  by  αβ γ. In Case 2 we use a double rotation, first rotating  X, B  right, then  A, X  left. In both cases only a few links of the tree need to be changed. Furthermore, the new trees have height h + 2, which is exactly the height that was present before the insertion; hence the rest of the tree  if any  that was originally above node A always remains balanced.  For example, if we insert a new node into position 17 of Fig. 20 we obtain the balanced tree shown in Fig. 21, after a single rotation  Case 1 . Notice that several of the balance factors have changed.  The details of this insertion procedure can be worked out in several ways. At first glance an auxiliary stack seems to be necessary, in order to keep track of which nodes will be affected, but the following algorithm gains some speed by  A  ++  α  h  +  B  β  γ  h  h+1  A  ++  α  h  − X  B  δ  β  γ  h−1  h  h  B  β  A  α  h  γ  h+1  X  β  γ  B  δ  A  α  h   462  SEARCHING  6.2.3  Fig. 21. The tree of Fig. 20, rebalanced after a new key R has been inserted.  exploiting the fact that the balance factor of node B in  1  was zero before the insertion. Algorithm A  Balanced tree search and insertion . Given a table of records that form a balanced binary tree as described above, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. If K is not in the table, a new node containing K is inserted into the tree in the appropriate place and the tree is rebalanced if necessary.  The nodes of the tree are assumed to contain KEY, LLINK, and RLINK fields  as in Algorithm 6.2.2T. We also have a new field  B P  = balance factor of NODE P ,  the height of the right subtree minus the height of the left subtree; this field always contains either +1, 0, or −1. A special header node also appears at the top of the tree, in location HEAD; the value of RLINK HEAD  is a pointer to the root of the tree, and LLINK HEAD  is used to keep track of the overall height of the tree.  Knowledge of the height is not really necessary for this algorithm, but it is useful in the concatenation procedure discussed below.  We assume that the tree is nonempty, namely that RLINK HEAD  ̸= Λ. as a synonym for LLINK P  if a = −1, and for RLINK P  if a = +1. A1. [Initialize.] Set T ← HEAD, S ← P ← RLINK HEAD .  The pointer variable P will move down the tree; S will point to the place where rebalancing may be necessary, and T always points to the parent of S.   For convenience in description, the algorithm uses the notation LINK a,P   A2. [Compare.] If K   KEY P , go to A4; and if  K = KEY P , the search terminates successfully.  A3.

[Insert.]  We have just linked a new node, NODE Q , into the tree, and its fields need to be initialized.  Set KEY Q  ← K, LLINK Q  ← RLINK Q  ← Λ, and B Q  ← 0.  A6. [Adjust balance factors.]  Now the balance factors on nodes between S and Q need to be changed from zero to ±1.  If K < KEY S  set a ← −1, otherwise set a ← +1. Then set R ← P ← LINK a,S , and repeatedly do the following operations zero or more times until P = Q: If K < KEY P  set B P  ← −1 and P ← LLINK P ; if K > KEY P , set B P  ← +1 and P ← RLINK P .  If K = KEY P , then P = Q and we proceed to the next step.   A7. [Balancing act.] Several cases now arise:  i  If B S  = 0  the tree has grown higher , set B S  ← a, LLINK HEAD  ii  If B S  = −a  the tree has gotten more balanced , set B S  ← 0 and  ← LLINK HEAD  + 1, and terminate the algorithm.  iii  If B S  = a  the tree has gotten out of balance , go to step A8 if  terminate the algorithm. B R  = a, to A9 if B R  = −a.  Case  iii  corresponds to the situations depicted in  1  when a = +1; S and R point, respectively, to nodes A and B, and LINK −a,S  points to α, etc.   A1.

[Finishing touch.]   We have completed the rebalancing transformation, taking  1  to  2 , with P pointing to the new subtree root and T pointing to the parent of the old subtree root S.  If S = RLINK T  then set RLINK T  ← P, otherwise set LLINK T  ← P. This algorithm is rather long, but it divides into three simple parts: Steps A1–A4 do the search, steps A5–A7 insert a new node, and steps A8–A10 rebal- ance the tree if necessary. Essentially the same method can be used if the tree is threaded  see exercise 6.2.2–2 , since the balancing act never needs to make difficult changes to thread links.  We know that the algorithm takes about C log N units of time, for some C, but it is important to know the approximate value of C so that we can tell how large N should be in order to make balanced trees worth all the trouble. The following MIX implementation gives some insight into this question. Program A  Balanced tree search and insertion .

No theoretical determination of the average behavior has been successfully com- pleted as yet, since the algorithm appears to be quite complicated, but several interesting theoretical and empirical results have been obtained.  In the first place we can ask about the number Bnh of balanced binary trees with n internal nodes and height h. It is not difficult to compute the generating  function Bh z  =  n≥0 Bnhzn for small h, from the relations B1 z  = z,  Bh+1 z  = zBh z Bh z  + 2Bh−1 z .  B0 z  = 1,   5    See exercise 6.  Thus B2 z  = 2z2 + z3, B3 z  = B4 z  =  4z4 + 6z5 + 4z6 + z7,  16z7 + 32z8 + 44z9 + ··· + 8z14 + z15,  and in general Bh z  has the form 2Fh+1−1zFh+2−1 + 2Fh+1−2Lh−1zFh+2 + complicated terms + 2h−1z2h−2 + z2h−1  6  for h ≥ 3, where Lk = Fk+1 + Fk−1.  This formula generalizes Theorem A.  The total number of balanced trees with height h is Bh = Bh 1 , which satisfies the recurrence  . . . AF1  Bh+1 = B2  B0 = B1 = 1,  Bh = AFh0 AFh−1  h + 2BhBh−1,   7  so that B2 = 3, B3 = 3 · 5, B4 = 32 · 5 · 7, B5 = 33 · 52 · 7 · 23; and, in general,  8  where A0 = 1, A1 = 3, A2 = 5, A3 = 7, A4 = 23, A5 = 347, . . . , Ah = Ah−1Bh−2 + 2. The sequences Bh and Ah grow very rapidly; in fact, they are doubly exponential: Exercise 7 shows that there is a real number θ ≈ 1.43687 such that  Bh =θ2h −θ2h−1 +θ2h−2 − ··· +  −1 hθ20.   9  If we consider each of the Bh trees to be equally likely, exercise 8 shows that the average number of nodes in a tree of height h is  h−1AF0 h ,  1  B′h 1  Bh 1  ≈  0.70118 2h − 1.   10  This indicates that the height of a balanced tree with N nodes is usually much closer to log2 N than to logϕ N.  Unfortunately, these results don’t really have much to do with Algorithm A, since the mechanism of that algorithm makes some trees significantly more probable than others. For example, consider the case N = 7, where 17 balanced trees are possible. There are 7! = 5040 possible orderings in which seven keys   468  SEARCHING  can be inserted, and the perfectly balanced “complete” tree  is obtained 2160 times. By contrast, the Fibonacci tree  occurs only 144 times, and the similar tree  6.2.3   11    12    13   occurs 216 times. Replacing the left subtrees of  12  and  13  by arbitrary four- node balanced trees, and then reflecting left and right, yields 16 different trees; the eight generated from  12  each occur 144 times, and those generated from  13  each occur 216 times. It is surprising that  13  is more common than  12 . The fact that the perfectly balanced tree is obtained with such high prob- ability — together with  10 , which corresponds to the case of equal probabili- ties — makes it plausible that the average search time for a balanced tree should be about lg N + c comparisons for some small constant c. But R. W. Floyd has observed that the coefficient of lg N is unlikely to be exactly 1, because the root of the tree would then be near the median, and the roots of its two subtrees would be near the quartiles; then single and double rotation could not easily keep the root near the median. Empirical tests indicate that the true average number of comparisons needed to insert the Nth item is approximately 1.01 lg N + 0.1, except when N is small.  In order to study the behavior of the insertion and rebalancing phases of Algorithm A, we can classify the external nodes of balanced trees as shown in Fig. 23. The path leading up from an external node can be specified by a sequence of +’s and -’s  + for a right link, - for a left link ; we write down the link specifications until reaching the first node with a nonzero balance factor, or until reaching the root, if there is no such node. Then we write A or B according as the new tree will be balanced or unbalanced when an internal node is ++-B, meaning is inserted in the given place. Thus the path up from 3 “right link, right link, left link, unbalance.” A specification ending in A requires   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  469  Fig. 23. Classification codes that specify the behavior of Algorithm A after insertion.  no rebalancing after insertion of a new node; a specification ending in ++B or --B requires a single rotation; and a specification ending in +-B or -+B requires a double rotation. When k links appear in the specification, step A6 has to adjust exactly k−1 balance factors. Thus the specifications give the essential facts that govern the running time of steps A6 to A10. Empirical tests on random numbers for 100 ≤ N ≤ 2000 gave the approxi- mate probabilities shown in Table 1 for paths of various types; apparently these probabilities rapidly approach limiting values as N → ∞. Table 2 gives the exact probabilities corresponding to Table 1 when N = 10, considering the 10! permutations of the input as equally probable.  The probabilities that show up as .143 in Table 1 are actually equal to 1 7, for all N ≥ 7; see exercise 11. Single and double rotations are equally likely when N ≤ 15, but double rotations occur slightly less often when N ≥ 16.

The average number of balanced factors changed from ±1 to 0 in steps A7 through A10 is approximately .534+2 .233+.232  ≈ 1.5; thus, inserting one new node adds about 1.8−1.5 = 0.3 unbalanced nodes, on the average. This agrees with the fact that about 68 percent of all nodes were found to be balanced in random trees built by Algorithm A.  2 1 − p , and it is −1 with the same probability 1  An approximate model of the behavior of Algorithm A has been proposed by C. C. Foster [Proc. ACM Nat. Conf. 20  1965 , 192–205.] This model is not rigorously accurate, but it is close enough to the truth to give some insight. Let us assume that p is the probability that the balance factor of a given node in a large tree built by Algorithm A is 0; then the balance factor is +1 with 2 1 − p . Let us probability 1 assume further  without justification  that the balance factors of all nodes are independent. Then the probability that step A6 sets exactly k−1 balance factors nonzero is pk−1 1 − p , so the average value of k is 1  1 − p . The probability that we need to rotate part of the tree is q ≈ 1 2. Inserting a new node should increase the number of balanced nodes by p, on the average; this number is actually increased by 1 in step A5, by −p  1 − p  in step A6, by q in step A7, and by 2q in step A8 or A9, so we should have  Solving for p yields fair agreement with Table 1:  p = 1 − p  1 − p  + 3q ≈ 5 2 − p  1 − p . p ≈ 9 − √  1  1 − p  ≈ 2.851.  ≈ 0.649;  41  4   14   The running time of the search phase of Program A  lines 01–19  is  10C + C1 + 2D + 2 − 3S,   15  where C, C1, S are the same as in previous algorithms of this chapter and D is the number of unbalanced nodes encountered on the search path. Empirical tests show that we may take D ≈ 1 2 C + S , C + S ≈ 1.01 lg N + 0.1, so the average search time is approximately 11.3 lg N + 3− 13.7S units.  If searching is done much more often than insertion, we could of course use a separate, faster program for searching, since it would be unnecessary to look at the balance factors; the average running time for a successful search would then be only about  6.6 lg N − 3.4 u, and the worst case running time would in fact be better than the average running time obtained with Program 6.2.2T.   3 C, C1 ≈ 1   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  471  Fig. 24. RANK fields, used for searching by position.  The running time of the insertion phase of Program A  lines 20–45  is 8F + 26 +  0, 1, or 2  units, when the search is unsuccessful. The data of Table 1 indicate that F ≈ 1.8 on the average. The rebalancing phase  lines 46–101  takes either 16.5, 8, 27.5, or 45.5  ±0.5  units, depending on whether we increase the total height, or simply exit without rebalancing, or do a single or double rotation. The first case almost never occurs, and the others occur with the approximate probabilities .534, .233, .232, so the average running time of the combined insertion-rebalancing portion of Program A is about 63u.  These figures indicate that maintenance of a balanced tree in memory is reasonably fast, even though the program is rather lengthy. If the input data are random, the simple tree insertion algorithm of Section 6.2.2 is roughly 50u faster per insertion; but the balanced tree algorithm is guaranteed to be reliable even with nonrandom input data.  One way to compare Program A with Program 6.2.2T is to consider the worst case of the latter. If we study the amount of time necessary to insert N keys in increasing order into an initially empty tree, it turns out that Program A is slower for N ≤ 26 and faster for N ≥ 27. Linear list representation. Now let us return to the claim made at the beginning of this section, that balanced trees can be used to represent linear lists in such a way that we can insert items rapidly  overcoming the difficulty of sequential allocation , yet we can also perform random accesses to list items  overcoming the difficulty of linked allocation .  The idea is to introduce a new field in each node, called the RANK field. The field indicates the relative position of that node in its subtree, namely one plus the number of nodes in its left subtree. Figure 24 shows the RANK values for the binary tree of Fig. 23. We can eliminate the KEY field entirely; or, if desired, we can have both KEY and RANK fields, so that it is possible to retrieve items either by their key value or by their relative position in the list.  Using such a RANK field, retrieval by position is a straightforward modifica-  tion of the search algorithms we have been studying.  +  6  −  4  2  1  1  1  1  5  +  2  −  2  3  −  2  2  1  1  1  1   472  SEARCHING  6.2.3  Algorithm B  Tree search by position . Given a linear list represented as a binary tree, this algorithm finds the kth element of the list  the kth node of the tree in symmetric order , given k. The binary tree is assumed to have LLINK and RLINK fields and a header as in Algorithm A, plus a RANK field as described above. B1. [Initialize.] Set M ← k, P ← RLINK HEAD . B2. [Compare.] If P = Λ, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully.  This can happen only if k was greater than the number of nodes in the tree, or k ≤ 0.  Otherwise if M   RANK P , go to B4; and if M = RANK P , the algorithm terminates successfully  P points to the kth node .  B3. [Move left.] Set P ← LLINK P  and return to B2. B4. [Move right.] Set M ← M−RANK P  and P ← RLINK P  and return to B2.  The only new point of interest in this algorithm is the manipulation of M in step B4. We can modify the insertion procedure in a similar way, although the details are somewhat trickier: Algorithm C  Balanced tree insertion by position . Given a linear list repre- sented as a balanced binary tree, this algorithm inserts a new node just before the kth element of the list, given k and a pointer Q to the new node. If k = N +1, the new node is inserted just after the last element of the list.  The binary tree is assumed to be nonempty and to have LLINK, RLINK and B fields and a header, as in Algorithm A, plus a RANK field as described above. This algorithm is merely a transcription of Algorithm A; the difference is that it uses and updates the RANK fields instead of the KEY fields. C1. [Initialize.] Set T ← HEAD, S ← P ← RLINK HEAD , U ← M ← k. C2. [Compare.] If M ≤ RANK P , go to C3, otherwise go to C4. C3.

Otherwise if B R  ̸= 0 set T ← P, S ← R, and U ← M. Finally set P ← R and return to C2.  C4. [Move right.] Set M ← M − RANK P , and R ← RLINK P . If R = Λ, set RLINK P  ← Q and go to C5. Otherwise if B R  ̸= 0 set T ← P, S ← R, and U ← M. Finally set P ← R and return to C2.  C5. [Insert.] Set RANK Q  ← 1, LLINK Q  ← RLINK Q  ← Λ, B Q  ← 0. C6. [Adjust balance factors.] Set M ← U.  This restores the former value of M when P was S; all RANK fields are now properly set.  If M < RANK S , set R ← P ← LLINK S  and a ← −1; otherwise set R ← P ← RLINK S , a ← +1, and M ← M − RANK S . Then repeatedly do the following operations If M < RANK P , set B P  ← −1 and P ← LLINK P ; if until P = Q: M > RANK P , set B P  ← +1 and M ← M − RANK P  and P ← RLINK P .  If M = RANK P , then P = Q and we proceed to the next step.   C7. [Balancing act.] Several cases now arise.   6.2.3  473 i  If B S  = 0, set B S  ← a, LLINK HEAD  ← LLINK HEAD  + 1, and  BALANCED TREES  terminate the algorithm.  ii  If B S  = −a, set B S  ← 0 and terminate the algorithm. iii  If B S  = a, go to step C8 if B R  = a, to C9 if B R  = −a.

Then if a = +1, set RANK R  ← RANK R  − RANK P , RANK P  ← RANK P  + RANK S ; if a = −1, set RANK P  ← RANK P  + RANK R , then RANK S  ← RANK S  − RANK P .  C10. [Finishing touch.] If S = RLINK T  then set RLINK T  ← P, otherwise set  LLINK T  ← P.  *Deletion, concatenation, etc. It is possible to do many other things to balanced trees and maintain the balance, but the algorithms are sufficiently lengthy that the details are beyond the scope of this book. We shall discuss the general ideas here, and an interested reader will be able to fill in the details without much difficulty.  . . . ,   Pl, al ,   P0, a0 ,   P1, a1 ,  The problem of deletion can be solved in O log N  steps if we approach it correctly [C. C. Foster, “A Study of AVL Trees,” Goodyear Aerospace Corp. report GER-12158  April 1965 ]. In the first place we can reduce deletion of an arbitrary node to the simple deletion of a node P for which LLINK P  or RLINK P  is Λ, as in Algorithm 6.2.2D. The algorithm should also be modified so that it constructs a list of pointers that specify the path to node P, namely  16  where P0 = HEAD, a0 = +1; LINK ai,Pi  = Pi+1, for 0 ≤ i < l; Pl = P; and LINK al,Pl  = Λ. This list can be placed on an auxiliary stack as we search down the tree. The process of deleting node P sets LINK al−1,Pl−1  ← LINK −al,Pl , and we must adjust the balance factor at node Pl−1. Suppose that we need to adjust the balance factor at node Pk, because the ak subtree of this node has just decreased in height; the following adjustment procedure should be used: If k = 0, set LLINK HEAD  ← LLINK HEAD  − 1 and terminate the algorithm, since the whole tree has decreased in height. Otherwise look at the balance factor B Pk ; there are three cases: i  B Pk  = ak. Set B Pk  ← 0, decrease k by 1, and repeat the adjustment ii  B Pk  = 0. Set B Pk  to −ak and terminate the deletion algorithm. iii  B Pk  = −ak. Rebalancing is required! The situations that require rebalancing are almost the same as we met in the insertion algorithm; referring again to  1 , A is node Pk, and B is the node LINK −ak,Pk , on the opposite branch from where the deletion has occurred. The only new feature is that node B might be balanced; this leads to a new  procedure for this new value of k.   474  SEARCHING  6.2.3  Case 3, which is like Case 1 except that β has height h + 1. In the for- mer cases, rebalancing as in  2  means that we decrease the height, so we set LINK ak−1,Pk−1  to the root of  2 , decrease k by 1, and restart the adjustment procedure for this new value of k. In Case 3 we do a single rotation, and this leaves the balance factors of both A and B nonzero without changing the overall height; after making LINK ak−1,Pk−1  point to node B, we therefore terminate the algorithm. The important difference between deletion and insertion is that deletion might require up to log N rotations, while insertion never needs more than one. The reason for this becomes clear if we try to delete the rightmost node of a Fibonacci tree  see Fig. 8 in Section 6.2.1 . But empirical tests show that only about 0.21 rotations per deletion are actually needed, on the average.  The use of balanced trees for linear list representation suggests also the need for a concatenation algorithm, where we want to insert an entire tree L2 to the right of tree L1, without destroying the balance. An elegant algorithm for concatenation was first devised by Clark A. Crane: Assume that height L1  ≥ height L2 ; the other case is similar. Delete the first node of L2, calling it the juncture node J, and let L′2 be the new tree for L2 \{J}. Now go down the right links of L1 until reaching a node P such that  height P  − height L′2  = 0 or 1;  this is always possible, since the height changes by 1 or 2 each time we go down one level. Then replace  by  and proceed to adjust L1 as if the new node J had just been inserted by Algorithm A.  Crane also solved the more difficult inverse problem, to split a list into two parts whose concatenation would be the original list. Consider, for example, the problem of splitting the list in Fig. 20 to obtain two lists, one containing {A, . . . , I} and the other containing {J, . . . , Q}; a major reassembly of the subtrees is required. In general, when we want to split a tree at some given node P, the path to P will be something like that in Fig. 25. We wish to construct a left tree that contains the nodes of α1, P1, α4, P4, α6, P6, α7, P7, α, P in symmetric order, and a right tree that contains β, P8, β8, P5, β5, P3, β3, P2, β2. This can be done by a sequence of concatenations: First insert P at the right of α, then concatenate β with β8 using P8 as juncture node, concatenate α7 with αP using P7 as juncture node, α6 with α7P7αP using P6, βP8β8 with β5 using P5, etc.; the nodes P8, P7, . . . , P1 on the path to P are used as juncture nodes. Crane proved that this splitting algorithm takes only O log N  units of time, when the original tree contains N nodes; the essential reason is that concatenation using a given juncture node takes O k  steps, where k is the difference in heights between the  P  J  L cid:48   2  P   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  475  Fig. 25. The problem of splitting a list.  trees being concatenated, and the values of k that must be summed essentially form a telescoping series for both the left and right trees being constructed.  All of these algorithms can be used with either KEY or RANK fields or both, although in the case of concatenation the keys of L2 must all be greater than the keys of L1. For general purposes it is often preferable to use a triply linked tree, with UP links as well as LLINKs and RLINKs, together with a new one-bit field that specifies whether a node is the left or right child of its parent. The triply linked tree representation simplifies the algorithms slightly, and allows us to specify nodes in the tree without explicitly tracing the path to that node; we can write a subroutine to delete NODE P , given P, or to delete the node that follows NODE P  in symmetric order, or to find the list containing NODE P , etc. In the deletion algorithm for triply linked trees it is unnecessary to construct the list  16 , since the UP links provide the information we need. Of course, a triply linked tree requires us to change a few more links when insertions, deletions, and rotations are being performed. The use of a triply linked tree instead of a doubly linked tree is analogous to the use of two-way linking instead of one-way: We can start at any point and go either forward or backward. A complete description of list algorithms based on triply linked balanced trees appears in Clark A. Crane’s Ph.D. thesis  Stanford University, 1972 . Alternatives to AVL trees. Many other ways have been proposed to organize trees so that logarithmic accessing time is guaranteed. For example, C. C. Foster [CACM 16  1973 , 513–517] considered the binary trees that arise when we allow the height difference of subtrees to be at most k. Such structures have been called HB k   meaning “height-balanced” , so that ordinary balanced trees represent the special case HB 1 .

Reingold, and C. K. Wong. Instead of considering the height of trees, they stipulate that the subtrees of all nodes must satisfy  √  2 − 1 <  left weight right weight <  √  2 + 1,  where the left and right weights count the number of external nodes in the left and right subtrees, respectively. It is possible to show that weight balance can be maintained under insertion, using only single and double rotations for rebalancing as in Algorithm A  see exercise 25 . However, it may be necessary to do several rebalancings during a single insertion. It is possible to relax the conditions of  17 , decreasing the amount of rebalancing at the expense of increased search time.  Weight-balanced trees may seem at first glance to require more memory than plain balanced trees, but in fact they sometimes require slightly less! If we already have a RANK field in each node, for the linear list representation, this is precisely the left weight, and it is possible to keep track of the corresponding right weights as we move down the tree. But it appears that the bookkeeping required for maintaining weight balance takes more time than Algorithm A, and the elimination of two bits per node is probably not worth the trouble.  Why don’t you pair ’em up in threes? — attributed to YOGI BERRA  c. 1970  Another interesting alternative to AVL trees, called “2-3 trees,” was intro- duced by John Hopcroft in 1970 [see Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms  Reading, Mass.: Addison–Wesley, 1974 , Chapter 4]. The idea is to have either 2-way or 3-way branching at each node, and to stipulate that all external nodes appear on the same level. Every internal node contains either one or two keys, as shown in Fig. 26.  Fig. 26. A 2-3 tree.  Insertion into a 2-3 tree is somewhat easier to explain than insertion into an AVL tree: If we want to put a new key into a node that contains just one key, we simply insert it as the second key. On the other hand, if the node already contains two keys, we divide it into two one-key nodes, and insert the middle key into the parent node. This may cause the parent node to be divided in a similar way, if it already contains two keys. Figure 27 shows the process of inserting a new key into the 2-3 tree of Fig. 26.

Hopcroft observed that deletion, concatenation, and splitting can all be done with 2-3 trees, in a reasonably straightforward manner analogous to the corresponding operations with AVL trees.  R. Bayer [Proc. ACM–SIGFIDET Workshop  1971 , 219–235] proposed an interesting binary tree representation for 2-3 trees. See Fig. 28, which shows the binary tree representation of Fig. 26; one bit in each node is used to distinguish “horizontal” RLINKs from “vertical” ones. Note that the keys of the tree appear from left to right in symmetric order, just as in any binary search tree. It turns out that the transformations we need to perform on such a binary tree, while in- serting a new key as in Fig. 27, are precisely the single and double rotations used while inserting a new key into an AVL tree, although we need just one version of each rotation, not the left-right reflections needed by Algorithms A and C.  Fig. 28. The 2-3 tree of Fig. 26 represented as a binary search tree.  Elaboration of these ideas has led to many additional flavors of balanced trees, most notably the red-black trees, also called symmetric binary B-trees or half-balanced trees [R. Bayer, Acta Informatica 1  1972 , 290–306; L. Guibas and R. Sedgewick, FOCS 19  1978 , 8–21; H. J. Olivié, RAIRO Informatique Théorique 16  1982 , 51–71; R. E. Tarjan, Inf. Proc.

There is also a strongly related family called hysterical B-trees or  a, b -trees, notably  2, 4 -trees [D. Maier and S. C. Salveter, Inf. Proc. Letters 12  1981 , 199–202; S. Huddleston and K. Mehlhorn, Acta Informatica 17  1982 , 157–184].

Dynamic trees that make it possible to maintain weighted balance within a constant factor of the optimum, called biased trees, have been developed by S. W. Bent, D. D. Sleator, and R. E. Tarjan, SICOMP 14  1985 , 545–568; J. Feigenbaum and R. E. Tarjan, Bell System Tech. J. 62  1983 , 3139–3158. The algorithms are, however, quite complicated.  A much simpler self-adjusting data structure called a splay tree was devel- oped subsequently by D. D. Sleator and R. E. Tarjan [JACM 32  1985 , 652–686], based on ideas like the move-to-front and transposition heuristics discussed in Section 6.1; similar techniques had previously been explored by B. Allen and I. Munro [JACM 25  1978 , 526–535] and by J. Bitner [SICOMP 8  1979 , 82–110]. Splay trees, like the other kinds of balanced trees already mentioned, support the operations of concatenation and splitting as well as insertion and deletion, and in a particularly simple way. Moreover, the time needed to access data in a splay tree is known to be at most a small constant multiple of the access time of a statically optimum tree, when amortized over any series of operations. Indeed, Sleator and Tarjan conjectured that the total splay tree access time is at most a constant multiple of the optimum time to access data and to perform rotations dynamically by any binary tree algorithm whatsoever.  Randomization leads to methods that appear to be even simpler and faster than splay trees. Jean Vuillemin [CACM 23  1980 , 229–239] introduced Car- tesian trees, in which every node has two keys  x, y . The x parts are ordered from left to right as in binary search trees; the y parts are ordered from top to bottom as in the priority queue trees of Section 5.2.3. C. R. Aragon and R. G. Seidel gave this data structure the more colorful name treap, because it neatly combines the notions of trees and heaps. Exactly one treap can be formed with n given key pairs  x1, y1 , . . . ,  xn, yn , if the x’s and y’s are distinct. One way to obtain it is to insert the x’s by Algorithm 6.2.2T according to the order of the y’s; but there is also a simple algorithm that inserts any new key pair directly into any treap. Aragon and Seidel observed [FOCS 30  1989 , 540–546] that if the x’s are ordinary keys while the y’s are chosen at random, we can be sure that the treap has the shape of a random binary search tree. In particular, a treap with random y values will always be reasonably well balanced, except with exponentially small probability  see exercise 5.2.2–42 . Aragon and Seidel also showed that treaps can readily be biased so that, for example, a key x with relative frequency f will appear suitably near the root when it is associated with y = U 1 f, where U is a random number between 0 and 1. Treaps performed consistently better than splay trees in some experiments conducted by D. E. Knuth relating to the calculation of convex hulls [Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 606  1992 , 53–55].  A new Section 6.2.5 devoted to randomized data structures is planned for the next edition of the present book. It will discuss “skip lists” [W. Pugh, CACM 33  1990 , 668–676] and “randomized binary search trees” [S. Roura and C. Martínez, JACM 45  1998 , 288–323] as well as treaps.   6.2.3  BALANCED TREES  479  EXERCISES 1.

Multiway Trees The tree search methods we have been discussing were developed primarily for internal searching, when we want to look at a table that is contained entirely within a computer’s high-speed internal memory. Let’s now consider the problem of external searching, when we want to retrieve information from a very large file that appears on direct access storage units such as disks or drums.  An introduction to disks and drums appears in Section 5.4.9.   Tree structures lend themselves nicely to external searching, if we choose an appropriate way to represent the tree. Consider the large binary search tree shown in Fig. 29, and imagine that it has been stored in a disk file.  The LLINKs and RLINKs of the tree are now disk addresses instead of internal memory addresses.  If we search this tree in a naïve manner, simply applying the algorithms we have learned for internal tree searching, we will have to make about lg N disk accesses before our search is complete. When N is a million, this means we will need 20 or so seeks. But suppose we divide the table into 7-node “pages,” as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 29; if we access one page at a time, we need only about one third as many seeks, so the search goes about three times as fast!  Grouping the nodes into pages in this way essentially changes the tree from a binary tree to an octonary tree, with 8-way branching at each page-node. If we let the pages be still larger, with 128-way branching after each disk access, we can find any desired key in a million-entry table after looking at only three pages. We can keep the root page in the internal memory at all times, so that only two references to the disk are required even though the internal memory never needs to hold more than 254 keys at any time.  Of course we don’t want to make the pages arbitrarily large, since the internal memory size is limited and also since it takes a long time to read a large page. For example, suppose that it takes 72.5 + 0.05m milliseconds to read a page that allows m-way branching. The internal processing time per page will   482  SEARCHING  6.2.4  Fig. 29. A large binary search tree can be divided into “pages.”  be about a + b lg m, where a is small compared to 72.5 ms, so the total amount of time needed for searching a large table is approximately proportional to lg N times   72.5 + 0.05m  lg m + b.  This quantity achieves a minimum when m ≈ 307; actually the minimum is very “broad” — a nearly optimum value is achieved for all m between 200 and 500. In practice there will be a similar range of good values for m, based on the characteristics of particular external memory devices and on the length of the records in the table.  W. I. Landauer [IEEE Trans. EC-12  1963 , 863–871] suggested building an m-ary tree by requiring level l to become nearly full before anything is allowed to appear on level l + 1. This scheme requires a rather complicated rotation method, since we may have to make major changes throughout the tree just to insert a single new item; Landauer was assuming that we need to search for items in the tree much more often than we need to insert or delete them.  When a file is stored on disk, and is subject to comparatively few insertions and deletions, a three-level tree is appropriate, where the first level of branching determines what cylinder is to be used, the second level of branching determines the appropriate track on that cylinder, and the third level contains the records themselves. This method is called indexed-sequential file organization [see JACM 16  1969 , 569–571].  R. Muntz and R. Uzgalis [Proc. Princeton Conf. on Inf. Sciences and Systems 4  1970 , 345–349] suggested modifying the tree search and insertion method, Algorithm 6.2.2T, so that all insertions go onto nodes belonging to the same page as their parent node, whenever possible; if that page is full, a new page is started, whenever possible. If the number of pages is unlimited, and if the data arrives in random order, it can be shown that the average number of page accesses is approximately HN   Hm−1 , only slightly more than we would obtain in the best possible m-ary tree.  See exercise 8.  B-trees. A new approach to external searching by means of multiway tree branching was discovered in 1970 by R. Bayer and E. McCreight [Acta Informa-   6.2.4  MULTIWAY TREES  483  tica 1  1972 , 173–189], and independently at about the same time by M. Kauf- man [unpublished]. Their idea, based on a versatile new kind of data structure called a B-tree, makes it possible both to search and to update a large file with guaranteed efficiency, in the worst case, using comparatively simple algorithms.  A B-tree of order m is a tree that satisfies the following properties:  i  Every node has at most m children. ii  Every node, except for the root and the leaves, has at least m 2 children. iii  The root has at least 2 children  unless it is a leaf . iv  All leaves appear on the same level, and carry no information. v  A nonleaf node with k children contains k − 1 keys.  As usual, a “leaf” is a terminal node, one with no children. Since the leaves carry no information, we may regard them as external nodes that aren’t really in the tree, so that Λ is a pointer to a leaf.  Figure 30 shows a B-tree of order 7. Each node  except for the root and the leaves  has between ⌈7 2⌉ and 7 children, so it contains 3, 4, 5, or 6 keys. The root node is allowed to contain from 1 to 6 keys; in this case it has 2. All of the leaves are at level 3. Notice that  a  the keys appear in increasing order from left to right, using a natural extension of the concept of symmetric order; and  b  the number of leaves is exactly one greater than the number of keys. B-trees of order 1 or 2 are obviously uninteresting, so we will consider only the case m ≥ 3. The 2-3 trees defined at the close of Section 6.2.3 are equivalent to B-trees of order 3.  Bayer and McCreight considered only the case that m is odd; some authors consider a B-tree of order m to be what we are calling a B-tree of order 2m + 1.   A node that contains j keys and j + 1 pointers can be represented as   1   where K1 < K2 < ··· < Kj and Pi points to the subtree for keys between Ki and Ki+1. Therefore searching in a B-tree is quite straightforward: After node  1  has been fetched into the internal memory, we search for the given argument among the keys K1, K2, . . . , Kj.  When j is large, we probably do a binary search; but when j is smallish, a sequential search is best.  If the search is successful, we have found the desired key; but if the search is unsuccessful because the argument lies between Ki and Ki+1, we fetch the node indicated by Pi and continue the process. The pointer P0 is used if the argument is less than K1, and Pj is used if the argument is greater than Kj. If Pi = Λ, the search is unsuccessful.  The nice thing about B-trees is that insertion is also quite simple. Consider Fig. 30, for example; every leaf corresponds to a place where a new insertion might happen. If we want to insert the new key 337, we simply change the  P  P0, K1, P1, K2, P2, . . . , Pj−1, Kj , Pj   484  SEARCHING  6.2.4  Fig. 30. A B-tree of order 7, with all leaves on level 3.

If that node now contains m keys, so that it has the form  1  with j = m, we split it into two nodes  and insert the key K⌈m 2⌉ into the parent of the original node.  Thus the pointer , P′.  This insertion P in the parent node is replaced by the sequence P, K⌈m 2⌉ may cause the parent node to contain m keys, and if so, it should be split in the same way.  Figure 27 in the previous section illustrates the case m = 3.  If we need to split the root node, which has no parent, we simply create a new root node containing the single key K⌈m 2⌉ ; the tree gets one level taller in this case. This insertion procedure neatly preserves all of the B-tree properties; in order to appreciate the full beauty of the idea, the reader should work exercise 1. The tree essentially grows up from the top, instead of down from the bottom, since it gains in height only when the root splits.  Deletion from B-trees is only slightly more complicated than insertion  see  exercise 6 . Upper bounds on the running time. Let us now see how many nodes have to be accessed in the worst case, while searching in a B-tree of order m. Suppose that there are N keys, and that the N + 1 leaves appear on level l. Then the number of nodes on levels 1, 2, 3, . . . is at least 2, 2⌈m 2⌉, 2⌈m 2⌉2, . . . ; hence  5   N + 1 ≥ 2⌈m 2⌉l−1.

Since we need to access at most l nodes during a search, this formula guarantees that the running time is quite small.  When a new key is being inserted, we may have to split as many as l nodes. However, the average number of nodes that need to be split is much less, since the total number of splittings that occur while the entire tree is being constructed is just the total number of internal nodes in the tree, minus l. If there are p  internal nodes, there are at least 1 +⌈m 2⌉ − 1 p − 1  keys; hence while building a tree of N keys, is less than 1 ⌈m 2⌉ − 1 split per insertion.   7  It follows that  p − l  N, the average number of times we need to split a node  p ≤ 1 + N − 1  ⌈m 2⌉ − 1 .  Refinements and variations. There are several ways to improve upon the basic B-tree structure defined above, by breaking the rules a little. In the first place, we note that all of the pointers in the level l − 1 nodes are Λ, and none of the pointers in the other levels are Λ. This often represents a significant amount of wasted space, so we can save both time and space by elim- inating all the Λ’s and using a different value of m for all of the “bottom” nodes. This use of two different m’s does not foul up the insertion algorithm, since both halves of a node that is being split remain on the same level as the original node. We could in fact define a generalized B-tree of orders m1, m2, m3, . . . by requiring all nonroot nodes on level l− k to have between mk 2 and mk children; such a B-tree has different m’s on each level, yet the insertion algorithm still works essentially as before.  To carry the idea in the preceding paragraph even further, we might use a completely different node format in each level of the tree, and we might also store information in the leaves. Sometimes the keys form only a small part of the records in a file, and in such cases it is a mistake to store the entire records in the branch nodes near the root of the tree; this would make m too small for efficient multiway branching.  We can therefore reconsider Fig. 30, imagining that all the records of the file are now stored in the leaves, and that only a few of the keys have been duplicated in the branch nodes. Under this interpretation, the leftmost leaf contains all records whose key is ≤ 011; the leaf marked A contains all records whose key satisfies   8  and so on. Under this interpretation the leaf nodes grow and split just as the branch nodes do, except that a record is never passed up from a leaf to the next level. Thus the leaves are always at least half filled to capacity. A new key enters the nonleaf part of the tree whenever a leaf splits. If each leaf is linked to its successor in symmetric order, we gain the ability to traverse the file both sequentially and randomly in an efficient and convenient manner. This variant has become known as a B+-tree.  439 < K ≤ 449;   6.2.4  MULTIWAY TREES  487  Some calculations by S. P. Ghosh and M. E. Senko [JACM 16  1969 , 569–579] suggest that it might be a good idea to make the leaves fairly large, say up to about 10 consecutive pages long. By linear interpolation in the known range of keys for each leaf, we can guess which of the 10 pages probably contains a given search argument. If our guess is wrong, we lose time, but experiments indicate that this loss might be less than the time we save by decreasing the size of the tree.  T. H. Martin [unpublished] has pointed out that the idea underlying B-trees can be used also for variable-length keys. We need not put bounds [m 2 . . m] on the number of children of each node; instead we can say merely that each node should be at least about half full of data. The insertion and splitting mechanism still works fine, even though the exact number of keys per node depends on whether the keys are long or short. However, the keys shouldn’t be allowed to get extremely long, or they can mess things up.  See exercise 5.   Another important modification to the basic B-tree scheme is the idea of overflow introduced by Bayer and McCreight. The idea is to improve the insertion algorithm by resisting its temptation to split nodes so often; a local rotation is used instead. Suppose we have a node that is over-full because it contains m keys and m + 1 pointers; instead of splitting it, we can look first at its sibling node on the right, which has say j keys and j + 1 pointers. In the parent node there is a key Kf that separates the keys of the two siblings; schematically,   m + j  2 keys in the left node, we replace Kf by K⌊ m+j  2⌋+1 in the parent containing, respectively, 2m − 2  3, 2m − 1  3, and ⌊2m 3⌋ keys:  If j < m − 1, a simple rearrangement makes splitting unnecessary: We leave node, and we put the ⌈ m + j  2⌉ remaining keys  including Kf  and the corresponding pointers into the right node. Thus the full node “flows over” into its sibling node. On the other hand, if the sibling node is already full  j = m−1 , we can split both of the nodes, making three nodes each about two-thirds full,   9    10   If the original node has no right sibling, we can look at its left sibling in essentially the same way.  If the original node has both a right and a left sibling, we could even refrain from splitting off a new node unless both left and right siblings are full.  Finally if the original node to be split has no siblings at all, it must be  · · · Kf P  · · · P cid:48  K cid:48  P cid:48   1  1  K1  · · · Km  P0  P1  Pm P cid:48   0  · · · K cid:48  P cid:48   j  j  · · · K cid:98  2m+1  3 cid:99  P cid:48  cid:48   K cid:48    cid:98  m−1  3 cid:99   · · ·  P · · ·  K1 K2  P0  P1  · · · Km Kf K cid:48  P cid:48   Pm P cid:48   1  0  1  · · ·  P cid:48   · · · K cid:48   j  P cid:48   j   6.2.4  488  SEARCHING  the root; we can change the definition of B-tree, allowing the root to contain as  many as 2 2m − 2  3 keys, so that when the root splits it produces two nodes of 2m − 2  3 keys each.  The effect of all the technicalities in the preceding paragraph is to produce a superior breed of tree, say a B∗-tree of order m, which can be defined as follows: i  Every node except the root has at most m children. ii  Every node, except for the root and the leaves, has at least  2m − 1  3  iii  The root has at least 2 and at most 2 2m − 2  3 + 1 children.  children.  iv  All leaves appear on the same level. v  A nonleaf node with k children contains k − 1 keys. The important change is condition  ii , which asserts that we utilize at least two-thirds of the available space in every node. This change not only uses space more efficiently, it also makes the search process faster, since we may replace  ⌈m 2⌉ by  2m − 1  3 in  6  and  7 . However, the insertion process gets  slower, because nodes tend to need more attention as they fill up; see B. Zhang and M. Hsu, Acta Informatica 26  1989 , 421–438, for an approximate analysis of the tradeoffs involved.  At the other extreme, it is sometimes better to let nodes become less than half full in a tree that changes quite frequently, especially if insertions tend to outnumber deletions. This situation has been analyzed by T. Johnson and D. Shasha, J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 47  1993 , 45–76.  Perhaps the reader has been skeptical of B-trees because the degree of the root can be as low as 2. Why should we waste a whole disk access on merely a 2-way decision?! A simple buffering scheme, called least-recently-used page replacement, overcomes this objection; we can keep several bufferloads of infor- mation in the internal memory, so that input commands can be avoided when the corresponding page is already present. Under this scheme, the algorithms for searching or insertion issue “virtual read” commands that are translated into actual input instructions only when the necessary page is not in memory; a subsequent “release” command is issued when the buffer has been read and possibly modified by the algorithm. When an actual read is required, the buffer that has least recently been released is chosen; we write out that buffer, if its contents have changed since they were read in, then we read the desired page into the chosen buffer.  Since the number of levels in the tree is generally small compared to the number of buffers, this paging scheme will ensure that the root page is always present in memory; and if the root has only 2 or 3 children, the first-level pages will almost surely stay there too. Any pages that might need to be split during an insertion are automatically present in memory when they are needed, because they will be remembered from the immediately preceding search.  Experiments by E. McCreight have shown that this policy is quite successful. For example, he found that with 10 buffers and m = 121, the process of inserting   6.2.4  MULTIWAY TREES  489  100,000 keys in ascending order required only 22 actual read commands, and only 857 actual write commands; thus most of the activity took place in the internal memory. Furthermore the tree contained only 835 nodes, just one higher than  the minimum possible value100000  m−1  = 834; thus the storage utilization  was nearly 100 percent. For this experiment he used the overflow technique, but with only 2-way node splitting as in  4 , not 3-way splitting as in  10 .  See exercise 3.   In another experiment, again with 10 buffers and m = 121 and the overflow technique, he inserted 5000 keys into an initially empty tree, in random order; this produced a 2-level tree with 48 nodes  87 percent storage utilization , after making 2762 actual reads and 2739 actual writes. Then 1000 random searches required 786 actual reads. The same experiment without the overflow feature produced a 2-level tree with 62 nodes  67 percent storage utilization , after making 2743 actual reads and 2800 actual writes; 1000 subsequent random searches required 836 actual reads. This shows not only that the paging scheme is effective but also that it is wise to handle overflows locally before deciding to split a node.  Andrew Yao has proved that the average number of nodes after random  insertions without the overflow feature will be  N  m ln 2  + O N m2 ,  for large N and m, so the storage utilization will be approximately ln 2 = 69.3 percent [Acta Informatica 9  1978 , 159–170]. See also the more detailed analyses by B. Eisenbarth, N. Ziviani, G. H. Gonnet, K. Mehlhorn, and D. Wood, Infor- mation and Control 55  1982 , 125–174; R. A. Baeza-Yates, Acta Informatica 26  1989 , 439–471.  B-trees became popular soon after they were invented. See, for example, the article by Douglas Comer in Computing Surveys 11  1979 , 121–137, 412, which discusses early developments and describes a widely used system called VSAM  Virtual Storage Access Method  developed by IBM Corporation. One of the innovations of VSAM was to replicate blocks on a disk track so that latency time was minimized.  Two of the most interesting developments of the basic B-tree strategy have unfortunately been given almost identical names: “SB-trees” and “SB-trees.” The SB-tree of P. E. O’Neil [Acta Inf. 29  1992 , 241–265] is designed to min- imize disk I O time by allocating nearby records to the same track or cylinder, maintaining efficiency in applications where many consecutive records need to be accessed at the same time; in this case “SB” is in italic type and the S connotes “sequential.” The SB-tree of P. Ferragina and R. Grossi [STOC 27  1995 , 693– 702; SODA 7  1996 , 373–382] is an elegant combination of B-tree structure with the Patricia trees that we will consider in Section 6.3; in this case “SB” is in roman type and the S connotes “string.” SB-trees have many applications to large-scale text processing, and they provide a basis for efficient sorting of variable-length strings on disk [see Arge, Ferragina, Grossi, and Vitter, STOC 29  1997 , 540–548].   490  SEARCHING  6.2.4  EXERCISES 1.

This area of investigation must draw upon the most powerful resources of both pure and applied mathematics for further progress. — ANTHONY G. OETTINGER  1961    492  SEARCHING  6.3  6.3. DIGITAL SEARCHING Instead of basing a search method on comparisons between keys, we can make use of their representation as a sequence of digits or alphabetic characters. Consider, for example, the thumb index on a large dictionary; from the first letter of a given word, we can immediately locate the pages that contain all words beginning with that letter.  If we pursue the thumb-index idea to one of its logical conclusions, we come up with a searching scheme based on repeated “subscripting” as illustrated in Table 1. Suppose that we want to test a given search argument to see whether it is one of the 31 most common words of English  see Figs. 12 and 13 in Section 6.2.2 . The data is represented in Table 1 as a trie structure; this name was suggested by E. Fredkin [CACM 3  1960 , 490–499] because it is a part of information retrieval. A trie — pronounced “try” — is essentially an M-ary tree, whose nodes are M-place vectors with components corresponding to digits or characters. Each node on level l represents the set of all keys that begin with a certain sequence of l characters called its prefix; the node specifies an M-way branch, depending on the  l + 1 st character.  For example, the trie of Table 1 has 12 nodes; node  1  is the root, and we look up the first letter here. If the first letter is, say, N, the table tells us that our word must be NOT  or else it isn’t in the table . On the other hand, if the first letter is W, node  1  tells us to go on to node  9 , looking up the second letter in the same way; node  9  says that the second letter should be A, H, or I. The prefix of node  10  is HA. Blank entries in the table stand for null links.  The node vectors in Table 1 are arranged according to MIX character code. This means that a trie search will be quite fast, since we are merely fetching words of an array by using the characters of our keys as subscripts. Techniques for making quick multiway decisions by subscripting have been called “table look-at” as opposed to “table look-up” [see P. M. Sherman, CACM 4  1961 , 172–173, 175]. Algorithm T  Trie search . Given a table of records that form an M-ary trie, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. The nodes of the trie are vectors whose subscripts run from 0 to M − 1; each component of these vectors is either a key or a link  possibly null . T1. [Initialize.] Set the link variable P so that it points to the root of the trie. T2. [Branch.] Set k to the next character of the input argument, K, from left to right.  If the argument has been completely scanned, we set k to a “blank” or end-of-word symbol. The character should be represented as a number in the range 0 ≤ k < M.  Let X be table entry number k in NODE P . If X is a link, go to T3; but if X is a key, go to T4.  T3. [Advance.]  If X ̸= Λ, set P ← X and return to step T2; otherwise the  algorithm terminates unsuccessfully.  T4. [Compare.] If X = K, the algorithm terminates successfully; otherwise it  terminates unsuccessfully.

This property is occasionally useful in applications.  In order to compare the speed of this algorithm to the others in this chapter, we can write a short MIX program assuming that the characters are bytes and that the keys are at most five bytes long. Program T  Trie search . This program assumes that all keys are represented in one MIX word, with blank spaces at the right whenever the key has less than five characters. Since we use MIX character code, each byte of the search argument is assumed to contain a number less than 30.

Since C ≤ 5, the search never needs more than 48 units of time. If we now compare the efficiency of this program  using the trie of Table 1  to Program 6.2.2T  using the optimum binary search tree of Fig. 13 , we can make the following observations.  Exit if not in the trie.  1. The trie takes much more memory space; we are using 360 words just to represent 31 keys, while the binary search tree uses only 62 words of memory.  However, exercise 4 shows that, with some fiddling around, we can actually fit the trie of Table 1 into only 49 words.   2. A successful search takes about 26 units of time for both programs. But an unsuccessful search will go faster in the trie, slower in the binary search tree. For this data the search will be unsuccessful more often than it is successful, so the trie is preferable from the standpoint of speed.  3. If we consider the KWIC indexing application of Fig. 15 instead of the 31 commonest English words, the trie loses its advantage because of the nature of the data. For example, a trie requires 12 iterations to distinguish between COMPUTATION and COMPUTATIONS. In this case it would be better to build the trie so that words are scanned from right to left instead of from left to right.  The abstract concept of a trie to represent a family of strings was introduced by Axel Thue, in a paper about strings that do not contain adjacent repeated substrings [Skrifter udgivne af Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiania, Mathematisk- Naturvidenskabelig Klasse  1912 , No. 1; reprinted in Thue’s Selected Mathe- matical Papers  Oslo: Universitetsforlaget, 1977 , 413–477].  Trie memory for computer searching was first recommended by René de la Briandais [Proc. Western Joint Computer Conf. 15  1959 , 295–298]. He pointed out that we can save memory space at the expense of running time if we use a linked list for each node vector, since most of the entries in the vectors tend to be empty. In effect, this idea amounts to replacing the trie of Table 1 by the forest of trees shown in Fig. 31. Searching in such a forest proceeds by finding the root that matches the first character, then finding the child node of that root that matches the second character, etc.  A  R  F  B  U   cid:32   N  S  T  E  Y  O  R  A A N D  A R E  A S  A T  B E  B U T  B Y  F O R  F R O M   6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  495  In his article, de la Briandais did not actually stop the tree branching exactly as shown in Table 1 or Fig. 31; instead, he continued to represent each key, character by character, until reaching the end-of-word delimiter. Thus he would actually have used  in place of the “H” tree in Fig. 31. This representation requires more storage, but it makes the processing of variable-length data especially easy. If we use two link fields per character, dynamic insertions and deletions can be handled in a simple manner.  If we use the normal way of representing trees as binary trees,  1  becomes  the binary tree   1    2    In the representation of the full forest, Fig. 31, we would also have a pointer leading to the right from H to its neighboring root I.  The search in this binary tree proceeds by comparing a character of the argument to the character in the tree, and following RLINKs until finding a match; then the LLINK is taken and we treat the next character of the argument in the same way.  With such a binary tree, we are more or less doing a search by comparison, with equal-unequal branching instead of less-greater branching. The elementary theory of Section 6.2.1 tells that we must make at least lg N comparisons, on  H  I  N  A  E  I   cid:32   N  S  T  F  R  O  A  I  Y  W  H  O  N  T  I  T H I S  H  E  T H E  A  T H A T  H A D  H A V E  H E  H E R  H I S  I I N  I S  I T  O F  O N  O R  N O T  T O  W A S  W H I C H  W I T H  Y O U  D  V   cid:32   R  H  E   cid:32   I  S   cid:32   R   cid:32   A  D   cid:32   V  E   cid:32   H  E   cid:32   I  S   cid:32   R   cid:32   A  D   cid:32   V  E   cid:32    496  SEARCHING  6.3  the average, to distinguish between N keys; the average number of tests made when searching a tree like that of Fig. 31 must be at least as many as we make when doing a binary search using the techniques of Section 6.2.  On the other hand, the trie in Table 1 is capable of making an M-way branch all at once; we shall see that the average search time for large N involves only about  logM N = lg N lg M  iterations, if the input data is random. We shall also see that a “pure” trie scheme like that in Algorithm T requires a total of approximately N ln M nodes to distinguish between N random inputs; hence the total amount of space is proportional to M N ln M.  From these considerations it is clear that the trie idea pays off only in the first few levels of the tree. We can get better performance by mixing two strategies, using a trie for the first few characters and then switching to some other technique. For example, E. H. Sussenguth, Jr. [CACM 6  1963 , 272– 279] suggested using a character-by-character scheme until we reach part of the tree where only, say, six or fewer keys of the file are possible, and then we can sequentially run through the short list of remaining keys. We shall see that this mixed strategy decreases the number of trie nodes by roughly a factor of six, without substantially changing the running time.  An interesting way to store large, growing tries in external memory was suggested by S. Y. Berkovich in Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR 202  1972 , 298–299 [English translation in Soviet Physics–Doklady 17  1972 , 20–21].  T. N. Turba [CACM 25  1982 , 522–526] points out that it is sometimes most convenient to search for variable-length keys by having one search tree or trie for each different length. The binary case. Let us now consider the special case M = 2, in which we scan the search argument one bit at a time. Two interesting methods have been developed that are especially appropriate for this case.  The first method, which we call digital tree search, is due to E. G. Coffman and J. Eve [CACM 13  1970 , 427–432, 436]. The idea is to store full keys in the nodes just as we did in the tree search algorithm of Section 6.2.2, but to use bits of the argument  instead of results of the comparisons  to govern whether to take the left or right branch at each step. Figure 32 shows the binary tree constructed by this method when we insert the 31 most common English words in order of decreasing frequency. In order to provide binary data for this illustration, the words have been expressed in MIX character code, and the codes have been converted into binary numbers with 5 bits per byte. Thus, the word WHICH is represented as the bit sequence 11010 01000 01001 00011 01000.  To search for this word WHICH in Fig. 32, we compare it first with the word THE at the root of the tree. Since there is no match and since the first bit of WHICH is 1, we move to the right and compare with OF. Since there is no match and since the second bit of WHICH is 1, we move to the right and compare with WITH; and so on. Alphabetic order of the keys in a digital search tree no longer corresponds to symmetric order of the nodes.   6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  497  Fig. 32. A digital search tree for the 31 most common English words, inserted in decreasing order of frequency.  It is interesting to note the contrast between Fig. 32 and Fig. 12 in Section 6.2.2, since the latter tree was formed in the same way but using comparisons instead of key bits for the branching. If we consider the given frequencies, the digital search tree of Fig. 32 requires an average of 3.42 comparisons per successful search; this is somewhat better than the 4.04 comparisons needed by Fig. 12, although of course the computing time per comparison will probably be different. Algorithm D  Digital tree search and insertion . Given a table of records that form a binary tree as described above, this algorithm searches for a given argument K. If K is not in the table, a new node containing K is inserted into the tree in the appropriate place.  This algorithm assumes that the tree is nonempty and that its nodes have In fact, the two  KEY, LLINK, and RLINK fields just as in Algorithm 6.2.2T. algorithms are almost identical, as the reader may verify.

Donald R. Morrison [JACM 15  1968 , 514–534] has discovered a very pretty way to form N-node search trees based on the binary representation of keys, without storing keys in the nodes. His method, called “Patricia”  Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric , is especially suit- able for dealing with extremely long, variable-length keys such as titles or phrases stored within a large bulk file. A closely related algorithm was published at almost exactly the same time in Germany by G. Gwehenberger, Elektronische Rechenanlagen 10  1968 , 223–226.  Patricia’s basic idea is to build a binary trie, but to avoid one-way branching by including in each node the number of bits to skip over before making the next test. There are several ways to exploit this idea; perhaps the simplest to explain is illustrated in Fig. 33. We have a TEXT array of bits, which is usually quite long; it may be stored as an external direct-access file, since each search accesses TEXT only once. Each key to be stored in our table is specified by a starting place in the text, and it can be imagined to go from this starting place all the way to the end of the text.  Patricia does not search for strict equality between key and argument; instead, it will determine whether or not there exists a key beginning with the argument.   T  H  I  S  ␣  I  S  ␣  T  H  E  ␣  H  O  U  S  E  ␣  T  H  A  T  ␣  J  A  C  K  ␣  B  U  I  L  T  ?  10111  01000  01001  10110  00000  01001  10110  00000  10111  01000  00101  00000  01000  10000  11000  10110  00101  00000  10111  01000  00001  10111  00000  01011  00001  00011  01100  00000  00010  11000  01001  01101  10111  11111  Fig. 33. An example of Patricia’s tree and TEXT.  The situation depicted in Fig. 33 involves seven keys, one starting at each word, namely “THIS IS THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT?” and “IS THE HOUSE THAT  α  1   IS   Header   THIS   γ  11   THE   δ  2   JACK    cid:15   1   THAT   β  1   BUILT   ζ  1   HOUSE    6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  499  JACK BUILT?” and . . . and “BUILT?”. There is one important restriction, namely that no one key may be a prefix of another; this restriction can be met if we end the text with a unique end-of-text code  in this case “?”  that appears nowhere else. The same restriction was implicit in the trie scheme of Algorithm T, where “␣” was the termination code.  The tree that Patricia uses for searching should be contained in random- access memory, or it should be arranged on pages as suggested in Section 6.2.4. It consists of a header and N − 1 nodes, where the nodes contain several fields: KEY, a pointer to the text. This field must be at least lg C bits long, if the text contains C characters. In Fig. 33 the words shown within each node would really be represented by pointers to the text; for example, instead of “ JACK ” the node would contain the number 24  which indicates the starting place of “JACK BUILT?” in the text string .  LLINK and RLINK, pointers within the tree. These fields must be at least  lg N bits long.  LTAG and RTAG, one-bit fields that tell whether or not LLINK and RLINK, respectively, are pointers to children or to ancestors of the node. The dotted lines in Fig. 33 correspond to pointers whose TAG bit is 1.  SKIP, a number that tells how many bits to skip when searching, as explained below. This field should be large enough to hold the largest number k such that all keys with prefix σ agree in the next k bits following σ, for some string σ that is a prefix of at least two different keys; in practice, we may usually assume that k isn’t too large, and an error indication can be given if the size of the SKIP field is exceeded. The SKIP fields are shown as numbers within each non-header node of Fig. 33.  The header contains only KEY, LLINK, and LTAG fields.  A search in Patricia’s tree is carried out as follows: Suppose we are looking up the word THE  bit pattern 10111 01000 00101 . We start by looking at the SKIP field of the root node α, which tells us to examine bit 1 of the argument. That bit is 1, so we move to the right. The SKIP field in the next node, γ, tells us to look at the 1 + 11 = 12th bit of the argument. It is 0, so we move to the left. The SKIP field of the next node, ϵ, tells us to look at the  12 + 1 st bit, which is 1; now we find RTAG = 1, so we go back to node γ, which refers us to the TEXT. The search path we have taken would occur for any argument whose bit pattern is 1xxxx xxxxx x01. . . , and we must check to see if it matches the unique key beginning with that pattern, namely THE.  Suppose, on the other hand, that we are looking for any or all keys starting with TH. The search process begins as above, but it eventually tries to look at the  nonexistent  12th bit of the 10-bit argument. At this point we compare the argument to the TEXT at the point specified in the current node  in this case node γ . If it does not match, the argument is not the beginning of any key; but if it does match, the argument is the beginning of every key represented by dotted links in node γ and its descendants  namely THIS, THAT, THE .   500  SEARCHING  6.3  The search process can be spelled out more precisely in the following way. Algorithm P  Patricia . Given a TEXT array and a tree with KEY, LLINK, RLINK, LTAG, RTAG, and SKIP fields, as described above, this algorithm determines whether or not there is a key in the TEXT that begins with a specified argument K.  If r such keys exist, for r ≥ 1, it is subsequently possible to locate them all in O r  steps; see exercise 14.  We assume that at least one key is present. P1. [Initialize.] Set P ← HEAD and j ← 0.  Variable P is a pointer that will move down the tree, and j is a counter that will designate bit positions of the argument.  Set n ← number of bits in K.  P2. [Move left.] Set Q ← P and P ← LLINK Q . If LTAG Q  = 1, go to P6. P3. [Skip bits.]  At this point we know that if the first j bits of K match any key whatsoever, they match the key that starts at KEY P .  Set j ← j+SKIP P . If j > n, go to P6.  P4. [Test bit.]  At this point we know that if the first j − 1 bits of K match any key, they match the key starting at KEY P .  If the jth bit of K is 0, go to P2, otherwise go to P5.  P5. [Move right.] Set Q ← P and P ← RLINK Q . If RTAG Q  = 0, go to P3. P6. [Compare.]  At this point we know that if K matches any key, it matches the key starting at KEY P .  Compare K to the key that starts at position KEY P  in the TEXT array. If they are equal  up to n bits, the length of K , the algorithm terminates successfully; if unequal, it terminates unsuccess- fully. Exercise 15 shows how Patricia’s tree can be built in the first place. We can also add to the text and insert new keys, provided that the new text material always ends with a unique delimiter  for example, an end-of-text symbol followed by a serial number .  Patricia is a little tricky, and she requires careful scrutiny before all of her  beauties are revealed. Analyses of the algorithms. We shall conclude this section by making a mathematical study of tries, digital search trees, and Patricia. A summary of the main consequences of these analyses appears at the very end.  Let us consider first the case of binary tries, namely tries with M = 2. Figure 34 shows the binary trie that is formed when the sixteen keys from the  sorting examples of Chapter 5 are treated as 10-bit binary numbers. The keys number 612 =  1001100100 2. As in Algorithm T, we use the trie to store  are shown in octal notation, so that for example 1144 represents the 10-bit  information about the leading bits of the keys until we get to the first point where the key is uniquely identified; then the key is recorded in full.  If Fig. 34 is compared to Table 5.2.2–3, an amazing relationship between trie memory and radix exchange sorting is revealed.  Then again, perhaps this relationship is obvious.  The 22 nodes of Fig. 34 correspond precisely to the 22   6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  501  Fig. 34. Example of a random binary trie.  partitioning stages in Table 5.2.2–3, with the pth node in preorder corresponding to Stage p. The number of bit inspections in a partitioning stage is equal to the number of keys within the corresponding node and its subtries; consequently we may state the following result. Theorem T. If N distinct binary numbers are put into a binary trie as described above, then  i  the number of nodes of the trie is equal to the number of partitioning stages required if these numbers are sorted by radix exchange; and  ii  the average number of bit inspections required to retrieve a key by means of Algorithm T is 1 N times the number of bit inspections required by the radix exchange sort.  Because of this theorem, we can make use of all the mathematical machinery that was developed for radix exchange in Section 5.2.2. For example, if we assume that our keys are infinite-precision random uniformly distributed real numbers between 0 and 1, the number of bit inspections needed for retrieval will be lg N + γ ln 2 + 1 2 + δ N  + O N−1 , and the number of trie nodes will be N ln 2 + N¯δ N  + O 1 . Here δ N  and ¯δ N  are complicated functions that may be neglected since their absolute value is always less than 10−6  see exercises 5.2.2–38 and 5.2.2–48 .  Of course there is still more work to be done, since we need to generalize from binary tries to M-ary tries. We shall describe only the starting point of the investigations here, leaving the instructive details as exercises. trie that contains N keys. Then A0 = A1 = 0, and for N ≥ 2 we have  Ak1 + ··· + AkM  ,  Let AN be the average number of internal nodes in a random M-ary search  AN = 1 +        3   N!  k1! . . . kM!

Similarly, if CN denotes the average total number of digit inspections needed to look up all N keys in the trie, we find C0 = C1 = 0 and  CN = N + M 1−N   N    k  k   M − 1 N−kCk  for N ≥ 2.   5   Exercise 17 shows how to deal with general recurrences of this type, and exercises 18–25 work out the corresponding theory of random tries. [The analysis of AN was first approached from another point of view by L. R. Johnson and M. H. McAndrew, IBM J. Res. and Devel. 8  1964 , 189–193, in connection with an equivalent hardware-oriented sorting algorithm.]  If we now turn to a study of digital search trees, we find that the formulas are similar, yet different enough that it is not easy to see how to deduce the asymptotic behavior. For example, if C N denotes the average total number of digit inspections made when looking up all N keys in an M-ary digital search tree, it is not difficult to deduce as above that C0 = C1 = 0, and  C N+1 = N + M 1−N   N    k  k   M − 1 N−k C k  for N ≥ 0.   6   This is almost identical to Eq.  5 ; but the appearance of N + 1 instead of N on the left-hand side of this equation is enough to change the entire character of the recurrence, so the methods we have used to study  5  are wiped out.  Let’s consider the binary case first. Figure 35 shows the digital search tree corresponding to the sixteen example keys of Fig. 34, when they have been inserted in the order used in the examples of Chapter 5. If we want to determine the average number of bit inspections made in a random successful search, this is just the internal path length of the tree divided by N, since we need l bit inspections to find a node on level l. Notice, however, that the average number of bit inspections made in a random unsuccessful search is not simply related to the external path length of the tree, since unsuccessful searches are more likely to occur at external nodes near the root; thus, the probability of reaching the left sub-branch of node 0075 in Fig. 35 is 1 8  assuming infinitely precise keys , and the left sub-branch of node 0232 will be encountered with probability only 1 32. For this reason, digital search trees tend to stay better balanced than the binary search trees of Algorithm 6.2.2T, when the keys are uniformly distributed.   6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  503  Fig. 35. A random digital search tree constructed by Algorithm D.  of a digital search tree.  We can use a generating function to describe the pertinent characteristics internal nodes on level l, consider l alzl; for example, the generating function If there are bl  the generating function a z  =  external nodes on level l, and if b z  =  corresponding to Fig. 35 is a z  = 1 + 2z + 4z2 + 5z3 + 4z4.  If there are al  l blzl, we have  2 b′  1  b z  = 1 +  2z − 1 a z   2  = a  1  l lbl2−l = 1  made in a random unsuccessful search is    7  by exercise 6.2.1–25. For example, 1 +  2z − 1  1 + 2z + 4z2 + 5z3 + 4z4  = 3z3 + 6z4 + 8z5. The average number of bit inspections made in a random successful search is a′ 1  a 1 , since a′ 1  is the internal path length of the tree and a 1  is the number of internal nodes. The average number of bit inspections 2 , since we end up at a given external node on level l with probability 2−l. The number of comparisons is the same as the number of bit inspections, plus one in a successful search. For example, in Fig. 35, a successful search will take 2 9 16 bit inspections 16 comparisons, on the average; an unsuccessful search will take 3 7 and 3 9 8 of each. Now let gN z  be the “average” a z  for trees with N nodes; in other words,  gN z  is the sum pT aT  z  over all binary digital search trees T with N internal  nodes, where aT  z  is the generating function for the internal nodes of T and pT is the probability that T occurs when N random numbers are inserted using Algorithm D. Then the average number of bit inspections will be g′N 1  N in a successful search, gN  1  2  in an unsuccessful search.  We can compute gN z  by mimicking the tree construction process, as follows. If a z  is the generating function for a tree of N nodes, we can form N +1 trees from it by making the next insertion into any one of the external node positions. The insertion goes into a given external node on level l with probability 2−l; hence the sum of the generating functions for the N +1 new trees, multiplied  by the probability of occurrence, is a z  + b 1  2 z = a z  + 1 +  z − 1 a 1 2 z.  0767  0127  1000  0075  0423  1215  1614  0252  0652  1144  1245  1601  0232  0775  1277  1375   504  SEARCHING  Averaging over all trees for N nodes, it follows that  gN+1 z  = gN z  + 1 +  z − 1 gN  g0 z  = 0.

Unfortunately, these expressions are not suitable for calculation or for finding an asymptotic expansion, since 2−j − 1 is negative; we get large terms and a lot of cancellation. A more useful formula for C N can be obtained by applying the partition identities of exercise 5.1.1–16.

A precisely analogous situation occurred for the trie case in Eqs. 5.2.2– 38  and 5.2.2– 39 ; in fact, if we consider only the terms of  14  with n = 0, we have exactly N − 1 plus the number of bit inspections in a binary trie. We can now proceed to get the asymptotic value in essentially the same way as before; see exercise 27. [The derivation above is largely based on an approach suggested by A. J. Konheim and D. J. Newman, Discrete Mathematics 4  1973 , 57–63.]  Fig. 36. Patricia constructs this tree instead of Fig. 34.  Finally let us take a mathematical look at Patricia. In her case the binary tree is like the corresponding binary trie on the same keys, but squashed together  because the SKIP fields eliminate 1-way branching , so that there are always exactly N−1 internal nodes and N external nodes. Figure 36 shows the Patrician tree corresponding to the sixteen keys in the trie of Fig. 34. The number shown in each branch node is the amount of SKIP; the keys are indicated with the external nodes, although the external node is not explicitly present  there is actually a tagged link to an internal node that references the TEXT, in place of each external node . For the purposes of analysis, we may assume that external nodes exist as shown.  Since successful searches with Patricia end at external nodes, the average number of bit inspections made in a random successful search will be the external path length, divided by N. If we form the generating function b z  for external  1  1  0 4 2 3  1  1  1  5  1  2  1  1  0 0 7 5  0 1 2 7  0 2 3 2  0 2 5 2  0 6 5 2  1 0 0 0  1 1 4 4  3  1  0 7 6 7  0 7 7 5  1 2 1 5  1 6 0 1  1 6 1 4  1  1  1  1 3 7 5  1 2 4 5  1 2 7 7   506  SEARCHING  6.3   16   nodes as above, this will be b′ 1  b 1 . An unsuccessful search with Patricia also ends at an external node, but weighted with probability 2−l for external nodes on level l, so the average number of bit inspections is 1 Fig. 36 we have b z  = 3z3+8z4+3z5+2z6; therefore there are 4 1 per successful search and 3 25  4 bit inspections Let hn z  be the “average” b z  for a Patrician tree constructed with n  32 per unsuccessful search, on the average.  . For example, in  hn z  = 21−n  external nodes, using uniformly distributed keys. The recurrence relation h1 z  = 1  2 b′ 1  h0 z  = 0,   n     15   2  appears to have no simple solution. But fortunately, there is a simple recurrence for the average external path length h′n 1 , since  k  k  hk z z + δkn 1 − z ,  n  n h′k 1  + 21−n    n    k  k  k  = n − 21−nn + 21−n  k  h′k 1 .  h′n 1  = 21−n    k  k  k 1 − δkn   Since this has the form of  6 , we can use the methods already developed to solve for h′n 1 , which turns out to be exactly n less than the corresponding number of bit inspections in a random binary trie. Thus, the SKIP fields save us about one bit inspection per successful search, on random data.  See exercise 31.  The redundancy of typical real data will lead to greater savings.  When we try to find the average number of bit inspections for a random  unsuccessful search by Patricia, we obtain the recurrence  an = 1 + 1  for n ≥ 2;  k  k<n  ak,   1  2n − 2  . This does not have the form of any recurrence we have  Here an = 1 studied, nor is it easily transformed into such a recurrence. The theory of Mellin transforms, introduced in Section 5.2.2 and the references cited there, provides a high-level way to deal with recurrences that have a digital character. It turns out that the solution to  17  involves the Bernoulli numbers:  2 h′n  a0 = a1 = 0.   17   2   n       n   Bk  n−1  k  k=2  2k−1 − 1 ,  2 − n + 2 = nan−1  for n ≥ 2.   18   This formula is probably the hardest asymptotic nut we have yet had to crack; the solution in exercise 34 is an instructive review of many things we have done before, with some slightly different twists. Summary of the analyses. As a result of all the complicated mathematics in this section, the following facts are perhaps the most noteworthy: a  The number of nodes needed to store N random keys in an M-ary trie, with the trie branching terminated for subfiles of ≤ s keys, is approximately N  s ln M . This approximation is valid for large N, small s, and small M.   6.3  DIGITAL SEARCHING  507  Since a trie node involves M link fields, we will need only about N ln M link fields if we choose s = M.  b  The number of digits or characters examined during a random search is approximately logM N for all methods considered. When M = 2, the various analyses give us the following more accurate approximations to the number of bit inspections:  Trie search Digital tree search Patricia  Successful  lg N + 1.33275 lg N − 1.71665 lg N + 0.33275  Unsuccessful lg N − 0.10995 lg N − 0.27395 lg N − 0.31875   These approximations can all be expressed in terms of fundamental mathemat- ical constants; for example, 0.31875 stands for  ln π − γ  ln 2 − 1 2.   c  “Random” data here means that the M-ary digits are uniformly distrib- uted, as if the keys were real numbers between 0 and 1 expressed in M-ary notation. Digital search methods are insensitive to the order in which keys are entered into the file  except for Algorithm D, which is only slightly sensitive to the order ; but they are very sensitive to the distribution of digits. For example, if 0-bits are much more common than 1-bits, the trees will become much more skewed than they would be for random data as considered in the analyses cited above.

The trees of Fig. 31 have their letters arranged in alphabetic  order within each family. This order is not necessary, and if we rearrange the order of nodes within the families before constructing binary tree representations such as  2  we may get a faster search. What rearrangement of Fig. 31 is optimum from this standpoint?  Use the frequency assumptions of Fig. 32, and find the forest that minimizes the successful search time when it has been represented as a binary tree.  6. [15] What digital search tree is obtained if the fifteen 4-bit binary keys 0001, 0010, 0011, . . . , 1111 are inserted in increasing order by Algorithm D?  Start with 0001 at the root and then do fourteen insertions.    cid:120  7. [M26] If the fifteen keys of exercise 6 are inserted in a different order, we might  get a different tree. Of all the 15! possible permutations of these keys, which is the worst, in the sense that it produces a tree with the greatest internal path length? 8. [20] Consider the following changes to Algorithm D, which have the effect of eliminating variable K′: Change “K′” to “K” in both places in step D2, and delete the operation “K′ ← K” from step D1. Will the resulting algorithm still be valid for searching and insertion? 9. [21] Write a MIX program for Algorithm D, and compare it to Program 6.2.2T. You may use binary operations such as SLB  shift left AX binary , JAE  jump if A even , etc.; and you may also use the idea of exercise 8 if it helps. 10. [23] Given a file in which all the keys are n-bit binary numbers, and given a search argument K = b1 b2 . . . bn, suppose we want to find the maximum value of k such that there is a key in the file beginning with the bit pattern b1 b2 . . . bk.

[M25] How many of the nodes, in a random M-ary trie containing N keys, have a null pointer in table entry 0?  For example, 9 of the 12 nodes in Table 1 have a null pointer in the “␣” position. “Random” in this exercise means as usual that the digits of the keys are uniformly distributed between 0 and M − 1.  22.

[25] Let a0 a1 a2 . . . be a periodic binary sequence with aN+k = ak for all k ≥ 0.  Show that there is a way to represent any fixed sequence of this type in O N  memory locations, so that the following operation can be done in only O N  steps: Given any binary pattern b0 b1 . . . bn−1, determine how often the pattern occurs in the period  thus, find how many values of p exist with 0 ≤ p < N and bk = ap+k for 0 ≤ k < n . The length n of the pattern is variable as well as the pattern itself. Assume that each memory location can hold arbitrary integers between 0 and N. [Hint: See exercise 14.] 41. [HM28] This is an application to group theory. Let G be the free group on the letters {a1, . . . , an}, namely the set of all strings α = b1 . . . br, where each bi is one of the aj or a−j and no adjacent pair aja−j or a−j aj occurs. The inverse of α is b−r . . . b−1 , and we multiply two such strings by concatenating them and canceling adjacent inverse pairs. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by the strings {β1, . . . , βp}, namely the set of all elements of G that can be written as products of the β’s and their inverses. According to a well-known theorem of Jakob Nielsen  see Marshall Hall, The Theory of Groups  New York: Macmillan, 1959 , Chapter 7 , we can always find generators θ1, . . . , θm   512  SEARCHING  6.3  j or θe  of H, with m ≤ p, having the property that the middle character of θi  or at least one of the two central characters of θi if it has even length  is never canceled in the expressions j θi, e = ±1, unless j = i and e = −1. This property implies that there is θiθe a simple algorithm for testing whether an arbitrary element of G is in H: Record the 2m keys θ1, . . . , θm, θ−1 , . . . , θ−m in a character-oriented search tree, using the 2n letters a1, . . . , an, a−1 , . . . , a−n . Let α = b1 . . . br be a given element of G; if r = 0, α is obviously in H. Otherwise look up α, finding the longest prefix b1 . . . bk that matches a key. If there is more than one key beginning with b1 . . . bk, α is not in H; otherwise let the . . . c−1 bk+1 . . . br. unique such key be b1 . . . bk c1 . . . cl = θe If this new value of α is longer than the old  that is, if l > k , α is not in H; otherwise repeat the process on the new value of α. The Nielsen property implies that this algorithm will always terminate. If α is eventually reduced to the null string, we can reconstruct the representation of the original α as a product of θ’s. For example, let {θ1, θ2, θ3} = {bbb, b−a−b−, ba−b} and α = bbabaab. The forest  i , and replace α by θ−e  i α = c−l  can be used with the algorithm above to deduce that α = θ1θ−3 θ1θ−3 θ−2 . Implement this algorithm, given the θ’s as input to your program. 42. [23]  Front and rear compression.  When a set of binary keys is being used as an index, to partition a larger file, we need not store the full keys. For example, if the sixteen keys of Fig. 34 are used, they can be truncated at the right, as soon as enough digits have been given to identify them uniquely: 0000, 0001, 00100, 00101, 010, . . . , 1110001. These truncated keys can be used to partition a file into seventeen parts, where for example the fifth part consists of all keys beginning with 0011 or 010, and the last part contains all keys beginning with 111001, 11101, or 1111. The truncated keys can be represented more compactly if we suppress all leading digits common to the previous key: 0000, ⋄⋄⋄1, ⋄⋄100, ⋄⋄⋄⋄1, ⋄10, . . . , ⋄⋄⋄⋄⋄⋄1. The bit following a ⋄ is always 1, so it may be suppressed. A large file will have many ⋄’s, and we need store only the number of ⋄’s and the values of the following bits. Show that the total number of bits in the compressed file, excluding ⋄’s and the following 1-bits, is always equal to the number of nodes in the binary trie for the keys.  Consequently the average total number of such bits in the entire index is about N ln 2, only 1.44 bits per key. This compression technique was shown to the author by A. Heller and R. L. Johnsen. Still further compression is possible, since we need only represent the trie structure; see Theorem 2.3.1A.  43. [HM42] Analyze the height of a random M-ary trie that has N keys and cutoff parameter s as in exercise 20.

HASHING So far we have considered search methods based on comparing the given argument K to the keys in the table, or using its digits to govern a branching process. A third possibility is to avoid all this rummaging around by doing some arithmetical calculation on K, computing a function f K  that is the location of K and the associated data in the table.  For example, let’s consider again the set of 31 English words that we have subjected to various search strategies in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.3. Table 1 shows a short MIX program that transforms each of the 31 keys into a unique number f K  between −10 and 30. If we compare this method to the MIX programs for the other methods we have considered  for example, binary search, optimal tree search, trie memory, digital tree search , we find that it is superior from the standpoint of both space and speed, except that binary search uses slightly less space. In fact, the average time for a successful search, using the program of Table 1 with the frequency data of Fig. 12, is only about 17.8u, and only 41 table locations are needed to store the 31 keys. Unfortunately, such functions f K  aren’t very easy to discover. There are 4131 ≈ 1050 possible functions from a 31-element set into a 41-element set, and only 41 · 40 · . . . · 11 = 41! 10! ≈ 1043 of them will give distinct values for each argument; thus only about one of every 10 million functions will be suitable.  Functions that avoid duplicate values are surprisingly rare, even with a fairly large table. For example, the famous “birthday paradox” asserts that if 23 or more people are present in a room, chances are good that two of them will have the same month and day of birth! In other words, if we select a random function that maps 23 keys into a table of size 365, the probability that no two keys map into the same location is only 0.4927  less than one-half . Skeptics who doubt this result should try to find the birthday mates at the next large parties they attend. [The birthday paradox was discussed informally by mathematicians in the 1930s, but its origin is obscure; see I. J. Good, Probability and the Weighing of Evidence  Griffin, 1950 , 38. See also R. von Mises, İstanbul Üniversitesi Fen Fakültesi Mecmuası 4  1939 , 145–163, and W. Feller, An Introduction to Probability Theory  New York: Wiley, 1950 , Section II.3.]  On the other hand, the approach used in Table 1 is fairly flexible [see M. Greniewski and W. Turski, CACM 6  1963 , 322–323], and for a medium- sized table a suitable function can be found after about a day’s work. In fact it is rather amusing to solve a puzzle like this. Suitable techniques have been discussed by many people, including for example R. Sprugnoli, CACM 20  1977 , 841–850, 22  1979 , 104, 553; R. J. Cichelli, CACM 23  1980 , 17–19; T. J. Sager, CACM 28  1985 , 523–532, 29  1986 , 557; B. S. Majewski, N. C. Wormald, G. Havas, and Z. J. Czech, Comp. J. 39  1996 , 547–554; Czech, Havas, and Majewski, Theoretical Comp.

Of course this method has a serious flaw, since the contents of the table must be known in advance; adding one more key will probably ruin everything,   514  SEARCHING  Table 1  6.4  TRANSFORMING A SET OF KEYS INTO UNIQUE ADDRESSES  A  D N A  E R A  S A  T A  E B  T U B  Y B  R O F  M O R F  D A H  E V A H  E H  R E H  .  .  .  9F  16  2 2 2  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  6 6 . 6 6  2 2 . 2 2  9 9 19  K 3:3  9F  10 13 14 −5 14 18 10 13 14 −5 14 18 . . 10 13 14 16 14 18 10 13 14 16 14 18  Instruction LD1N K 1:1  −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −2 −2 −2 −6 −6 −8 −8 −8 −8 K 2:2  −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −2 −2 −2 −6 −6 −8 −8 −8 −8 LD2 5 −15 −15 −11 −11 INC1 -8,2 5 −15 −15 −11 −11 J1P *+2 10 .

The verb “to hash” means to chop something up or to make a mess out of it; the idea in hashing is to scramble some aspects of the key and to use this partial information as the basis for searching. We compute a hash address h K  and begin searching there. The birthday paradox tells us that there will probably be distinct keys Ki ̸= Kj that hash to the same value h Ki  = h Kj . Such an occurrence is called a collision, and several interesting approaches have been devised to handle the collision problem. In order to use a hash table, programmers must make two almost independent decisions: They must choose a hash function h K , and they must select a method for collision resolution. We shall now consider these two aspects of the problem in turn. Hash functions. To make things more explicit, let us assume throughout this section that our hash function h takes on at most M different values, with   1  for all keys K. The keys in actual files that arise in practice usually have a great deal of redundancy; we must be careful to find a hash function that breaks up clusters of almost identical keys, in order to reduce the number of collisions.  0 ≤ h K  < M,   6.4  S I H  HASHING  515  I  N I  S I  T I  F O  N O  R O  T O N  T A H T  E H T  S I H T  O T  S A W  H C I H W  H T I W  U O Y  1 1 1  1 1 1  . . . . . . . .  5 5 . 5 5 . . . . . . . . 5 5 5  Contents of rI1 after executing the instruction, given a particular key K −8 −9 −9 −9 −9 −15 −16 −16 −16 −23 −23 −23 −23 −26 −26 −26 −28 −8 −9 −9 −9 −9 −15 −16 −16 −16 −23 −23 −23 −23 −26 −26 −26 −28 −7 −17 −2 6 −7 −18 −9 −5 −23 −23 −23 −15 −33 −26 −25 −20 −7 −17 −2 6 −7 −18 −9 −5 −23 −23 −23 −15 −33 −26 −25 −20 18 −1 29 12 . 18 −1 29 6 12 18 −1 29 12 6 8 . . 12 8 . . 12 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 −1 29 8 6 12 −1 29 8 6 12 −1 29 6 8 It is theoretically impossible to define a hash function that creates truly random data from the nonrandom data in actual files.

And in fact we can often do even better, by exploiting the nonrandom properties of actual data to construct a hash function that leads to fewer collisions than truly random keys would produce.  17 −16 −2 0 17 −16 −2 0 17 −16 −2 0 . −22 −21 −5 . −22 −21 −5 29 . . 29 29 . 11 . 11 . . 21 21 17 21 17 17 21  1 30 1 30 30 1 . −26 −22 −18 . −26 −22 −18 . −14 −6 2 . −14 −6 2 . −14 −6 2 . −2 . −10 . −2 . −10 . . . . 30 −10 −6 −2 30 −10 −6 −2 30 −10 −6 −2  11 −1 11 −1 11 −1 . −5 . −5 . . 11 −5 11 −5 11 −5  25 25 25 20 20 . . . . . . 20 20 20  22 22 22 . . . . . . . . 22 22 22  4 4 4 . . . . . . . . 4 4 4  Consider, for example, the case of 10-digit keys on a decimal computer. One hash function that suggests itself is to let M = 1000, say, and to let h K  be three digits chosen from somewhere near the middle of the 20-digit product K × K. This would seem to yield a fairly good spread of values between 000 and 999, with low probability of collisions. Experiments with actual data show, in fact, that this “middle square” method isn’t bad, provided that the keys do not have a lot of leading or trailing zeros; but it turns out that there are safer and saner ways to proceed, just as we found in Chapter 3 that the middle square method is not an especially good random number generator.  Extensive tests on typical files have shown that two major types of hash functions work quite well. One is based on division, and the other is based on multiplication.  The division method is particularly easy; we simply use the remainder  modulo M:   2  In this case, some values of M are obviously much better than others. For example, if M is an even number, h K  will be even when K is even and odd  h K  = K mod M.   516  SEARCHING  when K is odd, and this will lead to a substantial bias in many files. It would be even worse to let M be a power of the radix of the computer, since K mod M would then be simply the least significant digits of K  independent of the other digits . Similarly we can argue that M probably shouldn’t be a multiple of 3; for if the keys are alphabetic, two keys that differ only by permutation of letters would then differ in numeric value by a multiple of 3.  This occurs because 22n mod 3 = 1 and 10n mod 3 = 1.  In general, we want to avoid values of M that divide rk ± a, where k and a are small numbers and r is the radix of the alphabetic character set  usually r = 64, 256, or 100 , since a remainder modulo such a value of M tends to be largely a simple superposition of the key digits. Such considerations suggest that we choose M to be a prime number such that rk ̸≡ ±a  modulo M  for small k and a. This choice has been found to be quite satisfactory in most cases.  For example, on the MIX computer we could choose M = 1009, computing  h K  by the sequence  LDX K ENTA 0 DIV =1009=  rX ← K. rA ← 0. rX ← K mod 1009.  The multiplicative hashing scheme is equally easy to do, but it is slightly harder to describe because we must imagine ourselves working with fractions instead of with integers. Let w be the word size of the computer, so that w is usually 1010 or 230 for MIX; we can regard an integer A as the fraction A w if we imagine the radix point to be at the left of the word. The method is to choose some integer constant A relatively prime to w, and to let     A    K  w    h K  =  M  mod 1  .  In this case we usually let M be a power of 2 on a binary computer, so that h K  consists of the leading bits of the least significant half of the product AK. In MIX code, if we let M = 2m and assume a binary radix, the multiplicative  hash function is LDA K MUL A ENTA 0 SLB m Shift rAX m bits to the left.  rA ← K. rAX ← AK. rAX ← AK mod w.  6.4   3    4    5   Now h K  appears in register A. Since MIX has rather slow multiplication and shift instructions, this sequence takes exactly as long to compute as  3 ; but on many machines multiplication is significantly faster than division.  In a sense this method can be regarded as a generalization of  3 , since we could for example take A to be an approximation to w 1009; multiplying by the reciprocal of a constant is often faster than dividing by that constant. The technique of  5  is almost a “middle square” method, but there is one important difference: We shall see that multiplication by a suitable constant has demonstrably good properties.   6.4  HASHING  517  implies  K1 ̸= K2  f K1  ̸= f K2 .  One of the nice features of the multiplicative scheme is that no information is lost when we blank out the A register in  5 ; we could determine K again, given only the contents of rAX after  5  has finished. The reason is that A is relatively prime to w, so Euclid’s algorithm can be used to find a constant A′  with AA′ mod w = 1; this implies that K =A′ AK mod w  mod w. In other  words, if f K  denotes the contents of register X just before the SLB instruction in  5 , then   6  Of course f K  takes on values in the range 0 to w − 1, so it isn’t any good as a hash function, but it can be very useful as a scrambling function, namely a function satisfying  6  that tends to randomize the keys. Such a function can be very useful in connection with the tree search algorithms of Section 6.2.2, if the order of keys is unimportant, since it removes the danger of degeneracy when keys enter the tree in increasing order.  See exercise 6.2.2–10.  A scrambling function is also useful in connection with the digital tree search algorithm of Section 6.3, if the bits of the actual keys are biased.  Another feature of the multiplicative hash method is that it makes good use of the nonrandomness found in many files. Actual sets of keys often have a preponderance of arithmetic progressions, where {K, K+d, K+2d, . . . , K+td} all appear in the file; for example, consider alphabetic names like {PART1, PART2, PART3} or {TYPEA, TYPEB, TYPEC}. The multiplicative hash method converts an arithmetic progression into an approximate arithmetic progression h K , h K+d , h K+2d , . . . of distinct hash values, reducing the number of collisions from what we would expect in a random situation. The division method has this same property.  Fig. 37. Fibonacci hashing.  √  Figure 37 illustrates this aspect of multiplicative hashing in a particularly interesting case. Suppose that A w is approximately the golden ratio ϕ−1 =  5−1 2 ≈ 0.6180339887; then the successive values h K , h K +1 , h K +2 ,  . . . have essentially the same behavior as the successive hash values h 0 , h 1 , h 2 , . . . , so the following experiment suggests itself: Starting with the line  1  0  {nφ−1}  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  n   SEARCHING  518 6.4 segment [0 . . 1], we successively mark off the points {ϕ−1}, {2ϕ−1}, {3ϕ−1}, . . . , where {x} denotes the fractional part of x  namely x−⌊x⌋, or x mod 1 . As shown in Fig. 37, these points stay very well separated from each other; in fact, each newly added point falls into one of the largest remaining intervals, and divides it in the golden ratio! [This phenomenon was observed long ago by botanists Louis and Auguste Bravais, Annales des Sciences Naturelles 7  1837 , 42–110, who gave an illustration equivalent to Fig. 37 and related it to the Fibonacci sequence. See also S. Świerczkowski, Fundamenta Math. 46  1958 , 187–189.]  The remarkable scattering property of the golden ratio is actually just a special case of a very general result, originally conjectured by Hugo Steinhaus and first proved by Vera Turán Sós [Acta Math. Acad. Sci. Hung. 8  1957 , 461–471; Ann. Univ. Sci. Budapest. Eötvös Sect. Math. 1  1958 , 127–134]: Theorem S. Let θ be any irrational number. When the points {θ}, {2θ}, . . . , {nθ} are placed in the line segment [0 . . 1], the n + 1 line segments formed have at most three different lengths. Moreover, the next point { n+1 θ} will fall in one of the largest existing segments. Thus, the points {θ},{2θ}, . . . ,{nθ} are spread out very evenly between 0 and 1. If θ is rational, the same theorem holds if we give a suitable interpretation to the segments of length 0 that appear when n is greater than or equal to the denominator of θ. A proof of Theorem S, together with a detailed analysis of the underlying structure of the situation, appears in exercise 8; it turns out that the segments of a given length are created and destroyed in a first-in-first-out manner. Of course, some θ’s are better than others, since for example a value that is near 0 or 1 will start out with many small segments and one large segment. Exercise 9 shows that the two numbers ϕ−1 and ϕ−2 = 1− ϕ−1 lead to the “most uniformly distributed” sequences, among all numbers θ between 0 and 1. The theory above suggests Fibonacci hashing, where we choose the constant A to be the nearest integer to ϕ−1w that is relatively prime to w. For example if MIX were a decimal computer we would take  A = + 61 80 33 98 87 .   7  This multiplier will spread out alphabetic keys like LIST1, LIST2, LIST3 very nicely. But notice what happens when we have an arithmetic series in the fourth character position, as in the keys SUM1␣, SUM2␣, SUM3␣: The effect is as if Theorem S were being used with θ = {100A w} = .80339887 instead of θ = .6180339887 = A w. The resulting behavior is still all right, in spite of the fact that this value of θ is not quite as good as ϕ−1. On the other hand, if the progression occurs in the second character position, as in A1␣␣␣, A2␣␣␣, A3␣␣␣, the effective θ is .9887, and this is probably too close to 1.  Therefore we might do better with a multiplier like  A = + 61 61 61 61 61  in place of  7 ; such a multiplier will separate out consecutive sequences of keys that differ in any character position. Unfortunately this choice suffers from   HASHING  6.4 519 another problem analogous to the difficulty of dividing by rk ± 1: Keys such as XY and YX will tend to hash to the same location! One way out of this difficulty is to look more closely at the structure underlying Theorem S. For short progressions of keys, only the first few partial quotients of the continued fraction representation of θ are relevant, and small partial quotients correspond to good distribution properties. Therefore we find that the best values of θ lie in the ranges  4 < θ < 3 1 10 ,  3 < θ < 3 1 7 ,  7 < θ < 2 4 3 ,  10 < θ < 3 7 4 .  A value of A can be found so that each of its bytes lies in a good range and is not too close to the values of the other bytes or their complements, for example  8  Such a multiplier can be recommended.  These ideas about multiplicative hash- ing are due largely to R. W. Floyd.   A = + 61 25 42 33 71 .  A good hash function should satisfy two requirements:  a  Its computation should be very fast. b  It should minimize collisions. Property  a  is machine-dependent, and property  b  is data-dependent. If the keys were truly random, we could simply extract a few bits from them and use those bits for the hash function; but in practice we nearly always need to have a hash function that depends on all bits of the key in order to satisfy  b .  So far we have considered how to hash one-word keys. Multiword or vari- able-length keys can be handled by multiple-precision extensions of the methods above, but it is generally adequate to speed things up by combining the individual words together into a single word, then doing a single multiplication or division as above. The combination can be done by addition mod w, or by exclusive-or on a binary computer; both of these operations have the advantage that they are invertible, namely that they depend on all bits of both arguments, and exclusive- or is sometimes preferable because it avoids arithmetic overflow. However, both of these operations are commutative, hence  X, Y   and  Y, X  will hash to the same address; G. D. Knott has suggested avoiding this problem by doing a cyclic shift just before adding or exclusive-oring.  An even better way to hash l-character or l-word keys K = x1x2 . . . xl is to  h K  =h1 x1  + h2 x2  + ··· + hl xl  mod M,   9  where each hj is an independent hash function. This idea, introduced by J. L. Carter and M. N. Wegman in 1977, is especially efficient when each xj is a single character, because we can then use a precomputed array for each hj. Such arrays make multiplication unnecessary. If M is a power of 2, we can avoid the division in  9  by substituting exclusive-or for addition; this gives a different, but equally good, hash function. Therefore  9  certainly satisfies property  a . Moreover, Carter and Wegman proved that if the hj are chosen at random, property  b  will hold regardless of the input data.  See exercise 72.   compute   520  SEARCHING  6.4  Many more methods for hashing have been suggested, but none of them have proved to be superior to the simple methods described above. For a survey of several approaches together with detailed statistics on their performance with actual files, see the article by V. Y. Lum, P. S. T. Yuen, and M. Dodd, CACM 14  1971 , 228–239.  Of all the other hash methods that have been tried, perhaps the most in- teresting is a technique based on algebraic coding theory; the idea is analogous to the division method above, but we divide by a polynomial modulo 2 instead of dividing by an integer.  As observed in Section 4.6, this operation is analogous to division, just as addition is analogous to exclusive-or.  For this method, M should be a power of 2, say M = 2m, and we make use of an mth degree polynomial P x  = xm + pm−1xm−1 + ··· + p0. An n-digit binary key K =  kn−1 . . . k1 k0 2 can be regarded as the polynomial K x  = kn−1xn−1 + ··· + k1x + k0, and we compute the remainder  K x  mod P x  = hm−1xm−1 + ··· + h1x + h0  using polynomial arithmetic modulo 2; then h K  =  hm−1 . . . h1 h0 2. If P x  is chosen properly, this hash function can be guaranteed to avoid collisions between nearly equal keys. For example if n = 15, m = 10, and  P x  = x10 + x8 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1,   10  it can be shown that h K1  will be unequal to h K2  whenever K1 and K2 are distinct keys that differ in fewer than seven bit positions.  See exercise 7 for further information about this scheme; it is, of course, more suitable for hardware or microprogramming implementation than for software.   It is often convenient to use the constant hash function h K  = 0 when debugging a program, since all keys will be stored together; an efficient h K  can be substituted later. Collision resolution by “chaining.” We have observed that some hash addresses will probably be burdened with more than their share of keys. Perhaps the most obvious way to solve this problem is to maintain M linked lists, one for each possible hash code. A LINK field should be included in each record, and there will also be M list heads, numbered say from 1 through M. After hashing the key, we simply do a sequential search in list number h K  + 1.  See exercise 6.1–2. The situation is very similar to multiple-list-insertion sorting, Program 5.2.1M.   Figure 38 illustrates this simple chaining scheme when M = 9, for the  sequence of seven keys  K = EN, TO, TRE, FIRE, FEM, SEKS, SYV   the numbers 1 through 7 in Norwegian , having the respective hash codes  h K  + 1 = 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2.  The first list has two elements, and three of the lists are empty.   11    12    6.4  HASHING  521  Fig. 38. Separate chaining.  Chaining is quite fast, because the lists are short. If 365 people are gathered together in one room, there will probably be many pairs having the same birth- day, but the average number of people with any given birthday will be only 1! In general, if there are N keys and M lists, the average list size is N M; thus hashing decreases the average amount of work needed for sequential searching by roughly a factor of M.  A precise formula is worked out in exercise 34.   This method is a straightforward combination of techniques we have dis- cussed before, so we do not need to formulate a detailed algorithm for chained hash tables. It is often a good idea to keep the individual lists in order by key, so that unsuccessful searches — which must precede insertions — go faster. Thus if we choose to make the lists ascending, the TO and FIRE nodes of Fig. 38 would be interchanged, and all the Λ links would be replaced by pointers to a dummy record whose key is ∞.  See Algorithm 6.1T.  Alternatively we could make use of the “self-organizing” concept discussed in Section 6.1; instead of keeping the lists in order by key, they may be kept in order according to the time of most recent occurrence.  For the sake of speed we would like to make M rather large. But when M is large, many of the lists will be empty and much of the space for the M list heads will be wasted. This suggests another approach, when the records are small: We can overlap the record storage with the list heads, making room for a total of M records and M links instead of for N records and M + N links. Sometimes it is possible to make one pass over all the data to find out which list heads will be used, then to make another pass inserting all the “overflow” records into the empty slots. But this is often impractical or impossible, and we’d rather have a technique that processes each record only once when it first enters the system. The following algorithm, due to F. A. Williams [CACM 2, 6  June 1959 , 21–24], is a convenient way to solve the problem. Algorithm C  Chained hash table search and insertion . This algorithm looks for a given key K in an M-node table. If K is not in the table and the table is not full, K is inserted.

Chained hash table search and insertion.  The nodes of the table are denoted by TABLE[i], for 0 ≤ i ≤ M, and they are of two distinguishable types, empty and occupied. An occupied node contains a key field KEY[i], a link field LINK[i], and possibly other fields.  The algorithm makes use of a hash function h K . An auxiliary variable R is also used, to help find empty spaces; when the table is empty, we have R = M + 1, and as insertions are made it will always be true that TABLE[j] is occupied for all j in the range R ≤ j ≤ M. By convention, TABLE[0] will always be empty. C1. [Hash.] Set i ← h K  + 1.  Now 1 ≤ i ≤ M.  C2. [Is there a list?] If TABLE[i] is empty, go to C6.  Otherwise TABLE[i] is  occupied; we will look at the list of occupied nodes that starts here.   C3. [Compare.] If K = KEY[i], the algorithm terminates successfully. C4. [Advance to next.] If LINK[i] ̸= 0, set i ← LINK[i] and go back to step C3. C5. [Find empty node.]  The search was unsuccessful, and we want to find an empty position in the table.  Decrease R one or more times until finding a value such that TABLE[R] is empty. If R = 0, the algorithm terminates with overflow  there are no empty nodes left ; otherwise set LINK[i] ← R, i ← R.  C6. [Insert new key.] Mark TABLE[i] as an occupied node, with KEY[i] ← K  and LINK[i] ← 0. This algorithm allows several lists to coalesce, so that records need not be moved after they have been inserted into the table. For example, see Fig. 40, where SEKS appears in the list containing TO and FIRE since the latter had already been inserted into position 9.  In order to see how Algorithm C compares with others in this chapter, we can write the following MIX program. The analysis worked out below indicates that the lists of occupied cells tend to be short, and the program has been designed with this fact in mind.  C1. Hash  C2. Is there a list?  No  Yes  C3.

The running time of this program depends on C = number of table entries probed while searching; A = [initial probe found an occupied node]; S = [search was successful]; T = number of table entries probed while looking for an empty space.  Here S = S1 + S2, where S1 = 1 if successful on the first try. The total running time for the searching phase of Program C is  7C + 4A + 17 − 3S + 2S1 u, and the insertion of a new key when S = 0 takes an additional  8A + 4T + 4 u.  α = N M = load factor of the table.  Suppose there are N keys in the table at the start of this program, and let  14  Then the average value of A in an unsuccessful search is obviously α, if the hash function is random; and exercise 39 proves that the average value of C in an unsuccessful search is C′N = 1 + 1 4  N − 1 − 2N  ≈ 1 + e2α − 1 − 2α    1 + 2     15   M  M  4  .  Thus when the table is half full, the average number of probes made in an 4 e + 2  ≈ 1.18; and even when the table gets unsuccessful search is about 1 completely full, the average number of probes made just before inserting the 4 e2 + 1  ≈ 2.10. The standard deviation is also final item will be only about 1 small, as shown in exercise 40. These statistics prove that the lists stay short even though the algorithm occasionally allows them to coalesce, when the hash function is random. Of course C can be as high as N, if the hash function is bad or if we are extremely unlucky.  C′k + k M  N − 1 − 2N  In a successful search, we always have A = 1. The average number of probes during a successful search may be computed by summing the quantity C + A over the first N unsuccessful searches and dividing by N, if we assume that each  key is equally likely. Thus we obtain 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 CN = 1 8 ≈ 1 + e2α − 1 − 2α  N − 1  M ≈ 1 − 1   16  as the average number of probes in a random successful search. Even a full table will require only about 1.80 probes, on the average, to find an item! Similarly  see exercise 42 , the average value of S1 turns out to be   17  At first glance it may appear that step C5 is inefficient, since it has to search sequentially for an empty position. But actually the total number of table probes  S1N = 1 − 1 2  N − 1 M    + 1 4  + α 4  0≤k<N        M N  2 α.  8α  M  M  N   6.4  HASHING  525  made in step C5 as a table is being built will never exceed the number of items in the table; so we make an average of at most one of these probes per insertion. Exercise 41 proves that T is approximately αeα in a random unsuccessful search. It would be possible to modify Algorithm C so that no two lists coalesce, but then it would become necessary to move records around. For example, consider the situation in Fig. 40 just before we wanted to insert SEKS into position 9; in order to keep the lists separate, it would be necessary to move FIRE, and for this purpose it would be necessary to discover which node points to FIRE. We could solve this problem without providing two-way linkage by hashing FIRE and searching down its list, as suggested by D. E. Ferguson, since the lists are short. Exercise 34 shows that the average number of probes, when lists aren’t coalesced, is reduced to  C′N = 1 + N N − 1  2M 2 CN = 1 + N − 1 2M  ≈ 1 + α2 2 ≈ 1 + α 2   unsuccessful search ,   successful search .   18    19   This is not enough of an improvement over  15  and  16  to warrant changing the algorithm.  On the other hand, Butler Lampson has observed that most of the space that is occupied by links can actually be saved in the chaining method, if we avoid coalescing the lists. This leads to an interesting algorithm that is discussed in exercise 13. Lampson’s method introduces a tag bit in each entry, and causes the average number of probes needed in an unsuccessful search to decrease slightly, from  18  to  ≈ e−α + α.   18′     1 − 1  M  N + N  M  4  is thenL 2M + 1   1 + 2 M M − 1 + 1  Separate chaining as in Fig. 38 can be used when N > M, so overflow is not a serious problem in that case. When the lists coalesce as in Fig. 40 and Algorithm C, we can link extra items into an auxiliary storage pool; L. Guibas has proved that the average number of probes to insert the  M + L + 1 st item 2. However, it is usually preferable to use an alternative scheme that puts the first colliding elements into an auxiliary storage area, allowing lists to coalesce only when this auxiliary area has filled up; see exercise 43. Collision resolution by “open addressing.” Another way to resolve the problem of collisions is to do away with links entirely, simply looking at various entries of the table one by one until either finding the key K or finding an empty position. The idea is to formulate some rule by which every key K determines a “probe sequence,” namely a sequence of table positions that are to be inspected whenever K is inserted or looked up. If we encounter an empty position while searching for K, using the probe sequence determined by K, we can conclude that K is not in the table, since the same sequence of probes will be made every   526  SEARCHING  6.4  time K is processed. This general class of methods was named open addressing by W. W. Peterson [IBM J. Research & Development 1  1957 , 130–146].  The simplest open addressing scheme, known as linear probing, uses the  cyclic probe sequence  h K , h K  − 1, . . . , 0, M − 1, M − 2, . . . , h K  + 1   20   as in the following algorithm. Algorithm L  Linear probing and insertion . This algorithm searches an M- node table, looking for a given key K. If K is not in the table and the table is not full, K is inserted. The nodes of the table are denoted by TABLE[i], for 0 ≤ i < M, and they are of two distinguishable types, empty and occupied. An occupied node contains a key, called KEY[i], and possibly other fields. An auxiliary variable N is used to keep track of how many nodes are occupied; this variable is considered to be part of the table, and it is increased by 1 whenever a new key is inserted.  This algorithm makes use of a hash function h K , and it uses the linear probing sequence  20  to address the table. Modifications of that sequence are discussed below. L1. [Hash.] Set i ← h K .  Now 0 ≤ i < M.  L2. [Compare.] If TABLE[i] is empty, go to step L4. Otherwise if KEY[i] = K,  the algorithm terminates successfully.  L3. [Advance to next.] Set i ← i − 1; if now i < 0, set i ← i + M. Go back to  step L2. L4. [Insert.]   The search was unsuccessful.   If N = M − 1, the algorithm terminates with overflow.  This algorithm considers the table to be full when N = M − 1, not when N = M; see exercise 15.  Otherwise set N ← N + 1, mark TABLE[i] occupied, and set KEY[i] ← K. Figure 41 shows what happens when the seven example keys  11  are inserted by Algorithm L, using the respective hash codes 2, 7, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1: The last three keys, FEM, SEKS, and SYV, have been displaced from their initial locations h K .

This program deals with full-word keys; but a key of 0 is not allowed, since 0 is used to signal an empty position in the table.  Alternatively, we could require the keys to be nonnegative, letting empty positions contain −1.  The table size M is assumed to be prime, and TABLE[i] is stored in location TABLE + i for 0 ≤ i < M. For speed in the inner loop, location TABLE−1 is assumed to contain 0. Location VACANCIES is assumed to contain the value M − 1 − N; and rA ≡ K, rI1 ≡ i.  In order to speed up the inner loop of this program, the test “i < 0” has been removed from the loop so that only the essential parts of steps L2 and L3 remain. The total running time for the searching phase comes to  7C + 9E + 21 − 4S u, and the insertion after an unsuccessful search adds an extra 8u. 01 START LDX K ENTA 0 02 DIV =M= 03 STX *+1 0:2  04 ENT1 * 05 LDA K 06 JMP 2F 07 08 8H INC1 M+1 DEC1 1 09 3H CMPA TABLE,1 10 2H JE SUCCESS 11 LDX TABLE,1 12 JXNZ 3B 13 J1N 8B 14 LDX VACANCIES 15 4H JXZ OVERFLOW 16 DECX 1 17 STX VACANCIES 18 STA TABLE,1 19 As in Program C, the variable C denotes the number of probes, and S tells whether or not the search was successful.

The reason for this behavior can be understood by considering the following hypothetical hash table in which M = 19 and N = 9: 4  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  C + E − 1  C + E C + E  7  6  5  1  2  3  8  0   21   Shaded squares represent occupied positions. The next key K to be inserted into the table will go into one of the ten empty spaces, but these are not equally likely; in fact, K will be inserted into position 11 if 11 ≤ h K  ≤ 15, while it   528  SEARCHING  6.4  will fall into position 8 only if h K  = 8. Therefore position 11 is five times as likely as position 8; long lists tend to grow even longer.  This phenomenon isn’t enough by itself to account for the relatively poor behavior of linear probing, since a similar thing occurs in Algorithm C.  A list of length 4 is four times as likely to grow in Algorithm C as a list of length 1.  The real problem occurs when a cell like 4 or 16 becomes occupied in  21 ; then two separate lists are combined, while the lists in Algorithm C never grow by more than one step at a time. Consequently the performance of linear probing degrades rapidly when N approaches M.  We shall prove later in this section that the average number of probes needed  by Algorithm L is approximately  2      1 1 + 1 + 1 1 − α  1 − α    C′N ≈ 1 2 CN ≈ 1 2   unsuccessful search ,   successful search ,   22    23   where α = N M is the load factor of the table. Therefore Program L is almost as fast as Program C, when the table is less than 75 percent full, in spite of the fact that Program C deals with unrealistically short keys. On the other hand, when α approaches 1 the best thing we can say about Program L is that it works, slowly but surely. In fact, when N = M −1, there is only one vacant space in the table, so the average number of probes in an unsuccessful search is  M + 1  2; we shall also prove that the average number of probes in a successful search is  approximatelyπM 8 when the table is full.  The pileup phenomenon that makes linear probing costly on a nearly full table is aggravated by the use of division hashing, if consecutive key values {K, K+1, K+2, . . .} are likely to occur, since these keys will have consecutive hash codes. Multiplicative hashing will break up these clusters satisfactorily. Another way to protect against the consecutive hash code problem is to set i ← i − c in step L3, instead of i ← i − 1. Any positive value of c will do, so long as it is relatively prime to M, since the probe sequence will still examine every position of the table in this case. Such a change would make Program L a bit slower, because of the test for i < 0. Decreasing by c instead of by 1 won’t alter the pileup phenomenon, since groups of c-apart records will still be formed; equations  22  and  23  will still apply. But the appearance of consecutive keys {K, K+1, K+2, . . .} will now actually be a help instead of a hindrance.  Although a fixed value of c does not reduce the pileup phenomenon, we can improve the situation nicely by letting c depend on K. This idea leads to an important modification of Algorithm L, first introduced by Guy de Balbine [Ph.D. thesis, Calif. Inst. of Technology  1968 , 149–150]: Algorithm D  Open addressing with double hashing . This algorithm is almost identical to Algorithm L, but it probes the table in a slightly different fashion by making use of two hash functions h1 K  and h2 K . As usual h1 K  produces a value between 0 and M − 1, inclusive; but h2 K  must produce a value between   HASHING  6.4 529 1 and M − 1 that is relatively prime to M.  For example, if M is prime, h2 K  can be any value between 1 and M − 1 inclusive; or if M = 2m, h2 K  can be any odd value between 1 and 2m − 1.  D1. [First hash.] Set i ← h1 K . D2.

Several possibilities have been suggested for computing h2 K .  prime and h1 K  = K mod M, we might let h2 K  = 1 +K mod  M − 1 ; but since M − 1 is even, it would be better to let h2 K  = 1 +K mod  M − 2 . and 1019. Alternatively, we could set h2 K  = 1 +⌊K M⌋ mod  M − 2 ,  This suggests choosing M so that M and M − 2 are “twin primes” like 1021 since the quotient ⌊K M⌋ might be available in a register as a by-product of the computation of h1 K .  If M = 2m and we are using multiplicative hashing, h2 K  can be computed simply by shifting left m more bits and “oring in” a 1, so that the coding sequence in  5  would be followed by  If M is   24   ENTA 0 SLB m OR  =1=  Clear rA. Shift rAX m bits left. rA ← rA  1.  This is faster than the division method.  In each of the techniques suggested above, h1 K  and h2 K  are essentially independent, in the sense that different keys will yield the same values for both h1 and h2 with probability approximately proportional to 1 M 2 instead of to 1 M. Empirical tests show that the behavior of Algorithm D with independent hash functions is essentially indistinguishable from the number of probes that would be required if the keys were inserted at random into the table; there is practically no “piling up” or “clustering” as in Algorithm L.  It is also possible to let h2 K  depend on h1 K , as suggested by Gary Knott  in 1968; for example, if M is prime we could let  h2 K  =  M − h1 K ,  if h1 K  = 0; if h1 K  > 0.   25   This would be faster than doing another division, but we shall see that it does cause a certain amount of secondary clustering, requiring slightly more probes because of the increased chance that two or more keys will follow the same path. The formulas derived below can be used to determine whether the gain in hashing time outweighs the loss of probing time.   1,   530  SEARCHING  6.4  B  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  SUCCESS  VACANCIES OVERFLOW  C − 1 − S2 C − 1 − S2  1 − S 1 − S 1 − S 1 − S 1 − S 1 − S  VACANCIES K TABLE,1  15 3H DEC1 1,2 J1NN *+2 16 INC1 M 17 CMPA TABLE,1 18 SUCCESS JE 19 LDX TABLE,1 20 JXNZ 3B 21 22 4H LDX JXZ 23 DECX 1 24 STX 25 LDA 26 STA 27  Algorithms L and D are very similar, yet there are enough differences that it is instructive to compare the running time of the corresponding MIX programs.

The other variable B will be about  C−1  2 on the average.  If we restricted the range of h2 K  to, say, 1 ≤ h2 K  ≤ M 2, B would be only about  C − 1  4; this increase of speed will probably not be offset by a noticeable increase in the number of probes.  When there are N = αM keys in the table, the average value of A is, of course, α in an unsuccessful search, and A = 1 in a successful search. As in Algorithm C, the average value of S1 in a successful search is 1 − 1 2 α. The average number of probes 2 is difficult to determine exactly, but empirical tests show good agreement with formulas derived below for “uniform probing,” namely C′N = CN = M +1  27  when h1 K  and h2 K  are independent.

The running time for successful searching by three open addressing schemes.  Since each probe takes slightly less time in Algorithm L, double hashing is advantageous only when the table gets full. Figure 42 compares the average running time of Program L, Program D, and a modified Program D that involves secondary clustering, replacing the rather slow calculation of h2 K  in lines 10–13 by the following three instructions: c ← M − i. If i = 0, c ← 1.  ENN2 1-M,1 J1NZ *+2 ENT2 0  Program D takes a total of 8C + 19A + B + 26 − 13S − 17S1 units of time; modification  30  saves about 15 A − S1  ≈ 7.5α of these in a successful search. In this case, secondary clustering is preferable to independent double hashing. On a binary computer, we could speed up the computation of h2 K  in  another way, if M is prime greater than, say, 512, replacing lines 10–13 by   30   AND =511= STA *+1 0:2  ENT2 *  rA ← rA mod 512. c ← rA + 1.   31   This idea  suggested by Bell and Kaman, CACM 13  1970 , 675–677, who discovered Algorithm D independently  avoids secondary clustering without the expense of another division.  Many other probe sequences have been proposed as improvements on Algo- rithm L, but none seem to be superior to Algorithm D except possibly the method described in exercise 20.  By using the relative order of keys we can reduce the average running time for unsuccessful searches by Algorithms L or D to the average running time for successful search; see exercise 66. This technique can be important in applications for which unsuccessful searches are common; for example, TEX uses such an algorithm when looking for exceptions to its hyphenation rules.  e m  i t  X I M  60u  50u  40u  30u  20u  10u  0u  0  Program L  Program D  Program D modiﬁed as in     0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  Load factor, α = N M   532  SEARCHING  6.4  Fig. 43. The number of times a compiler typically searches for variable names. The names are listed from left to right in order of their first appearance.  Brent’s Variation. Richard P. Brent has discovered a way to modify Algo- rithm D so that the average successful search time remains bounded as the table gets full. His method [CACM 16  1973 , 105–109] is based on the fact that successful searches are much more common than insertions, in many applications; therefore he proposes doing more work when inserting an item, moving records in order to reduce the expected retrieval time.  For example, Fig. 43 shows the number of times each identifier was actually found to appear, in a typical PL I procedure. This data indicates that a PL I compiler that uses a hash table to keep track of variable names will be looking up many of the names five or more times but inserting them only once. Similarly, Bell and Kaman found that a COBOL compiler used its symbol table algorithm 10988 times while compiling a program, but made only 735 insertions into the table; this is an average of about 14 successful searches per unsuccessful search. Sometimes a table is actually created only once  for example, a table of symbolic opcodes in an assembler , and it is used thereafter purely for retrieval.  pj =h1 K − jh2 K  mod M and TABLE[pt] is empty. If t ≤ 1, we insert K in  Brent’s idea is to change the insertion process in Algorithm D as follows. Suppose an unsuccessful search has probed locations p0, p1, . . . , pt−1, pt, where position pt as usual; but if t ≥ 2, we compute c0 = h2 K0 , where K0 = KEY[p0], and see if TABLE[ p0 − c0  mod M] is empty. If it is, we set it to TABLE[p0] and then insert K in position p0. This increases the retrieval time for K0 by one step, but it decreases the retrieval time for K by t ≥ 2 steps, so it results in a net improvement. Similarly, if TABLE[ p0 − c0  mod M] is occupied and t ≥ 3, we try TABLE[ p0 − 2c0  mod M]; if that is full too, we compute c1 = h2 KEY[p1]  and try TABLE[ p1 − c1  mod M]; etc. In general, let cj = h2 KEY[pj]  and  25  20  15  10  5  0  T X Y A T S  X M U S  Y M U S  X X M U S  Y Y M U S  Y X M U S  X A M X  X A M Y  N I M X  N I M Y  P O T  X E G N A R  Y E G N A R  M R O T T O B  X E V A  Y E V A  X R A V  Y R A V  X D S  Y N I D S   HASHING  6.4 533 pj,k =  pj − kcj  mod M; if we have found TABLE[pj,k] occupied for all indices j and k such that j+k < r, and if t ≥ r+1, we look at TABLE[p0,r], TABLE[p1,r−1], . . . , TABLE[pr−1,1]. If the first empty space occurs at position pj,r−j we set TABLE[pj,r−j] ← TABLE[pj] and insert K in position pj. Brent’s analysis indicates that the average number of probes per successful search is reduced to the levels shown in Fig. 44, on page 545, with a maximum value of about 2.49.  3 α5 + α6 + ··· .  The number t+1 of probes in an unsuccessful search is not reduced by Brent’s variation; it remains at the level indicated by Eq.  26 , approaching 1 2 M + 1  as the table gets full. The average number of times h2 needs to be computed 3 α6 + ··· , according to Brent’s analysis, eventually per insertion is α2 + α5 + 1 √ approaching Θ  M  ; and the number of additional table positions probed while deciding how to make the insertion is about α2 + α4 + 4  E. G. Mallach [Comp. J. 20  1977 , 137–140] has experimented with refine- ments of Brent’s variation, and further results have been obtained by Gaston H. Gonnet and J. Ian Munro [SICOMP 8  1979 , 463–478]. Deletions. Many computer programmers have great faith in algorithms, and they are surprised to find that the obvious way to delete records from a hash table doesn’t work. For example, if we try to delete the key EN from Fig. 41, we can’t simply mark that table position empty, because another key FEM would suddenly be forgotten!  Recall that EN and FEM both hashed to the same location. When looking up FEM, we would find an empty place, indicating an unsuccessful search.  A similar problem occurs with Algorithm C, due to the coalescing of lists; imagine the deletion of both TO and FIRE from Fig. 40.  In general, we can handle deletions by putting a special code value in the corresponding cell, so that there are three kinds of table entries: empty, occupied, and deleted. When searching for a key, we should skip over deleted cells, as if they were occupied. If the search is unsuccessful, the key can be inserted in place of the first deleted or empty position that was encountered.  But this idea is workable only when deletions are very rare, because the entries of the table never become empty again once they have been occupied. After a long sequence of repeated insertions and deletions, all of the empty spaces will eventually disappear, and every unsuccessful search will take M probes! Furthermore the time per probe will be increased, since we will have to test whether i has returned to its starting value in step D4; and the number of probes in a successful search will drift upward from CN to C′N.  When linear probing is being used  Algorithm L , we can make deletions in a way that avoids such a sorry state of affairs, if we are willing to do some extra work for the deletion. Algorithm R  Deletion with linear probing . Assuming that an open hash table has been constructed by Algorithm L, this algorithm deletes the record from a given position TABLE[i]. R1. [Empty a cell.] Mark TABLE[i] empty, and set j ← i.   SEARCHING  534 R2. [Decrease i.] Set i ← i − 1, and if this makes i negative set i ← i + M. R3. [Inspect TABLE[i].] If TABLE[i] is empty, the algorithm terminates. Other- wise set r ← h KEY[i] , the original hash address of the key now stored at position i. If i ≤ r < j or if r < j < i or j < i ≤ r  in other words, if r lies cyclically between i and j , go back to R2.  R4. [Move a record.] Set TABLE[j] ← TABLE[i], and return to step R1.  6.4  Exercise 22 shows that this algorithm causes no degradation in performance; in other words, the average number of probes predicted in Eqs.  22  and  23  will remain the same.  A weaker result for tree insertion was proved in Theorem 6.2.2H.  But the validity of Algorithm R depends heavily on the fact that linear probing is involved, and no analogous deletion procedure for use with Algorithm D is possible. The average running time of Algorithm R is analyzed in exercise 64. Of course when chaining is used with separate lists for each possible hash value, deletion causes no problems since it is simply a deletion from a linked linear list. Deletion with Algorithm C is discussed in exercise 23.  Algorithm R may move some of the table entries, and this is undesirable if they are being pointed to from elsewhere. Another approach to deletions is possible by adapting some of the ideas used in garbage collection  see Section 2.3.5 : We might keep a reference count with each key telling how many other keys collide with it; then it is possible to convert unoccupied cells to empty status when their reference drops to zero. Alternatively we might go through the entire table whenever too many deleted entries have accumulated, changing all the unoccupied positions to empty and then looking up all remaining keys, in order to see which unoccupied positions still require “deleted” status. These proce- dures, which avoid relocation and work with any hash technique, were originally suggested by T. Gunji and E. Goto [J. Information Proc. 3  1980 , 1–12]. *Analysis of the algorithms. It is especially important to know the average behavior of a hashing method, because we are committed to trusting in the laws of probability whenever we hash. The worst case of these algorithms is almost unthinkably bad, so we need to be reassured that the average behavior is very good.  Before we get into the analysis of linear probing, etc., let us consider an approximate model of the situation, called uniform probing. In this model, which was suggested by W. W. Peterson [IBM J. Research & Devel. 1  1957 , 135–136], we assume that each key is placed in a completely random location of the table, so  that each of theM which r−1 given cells are occupied and another is empty, divided byM   possible configurations of N occupied cells and M−N empty , namely  cells is equally likely. This model ignores any effect of primary or secondary clustering; the occupancy of each cell in the table is essentially independent of all the others. Then the probability that any permutation of table positions needs exactly r probes to insert the  N + 1 st item is the number of configurations in  N  N   M − r  N − r + 1   M    ;  N  Pr =   6.4  HASHING  535  therefore the average number of probes for uniform probing is  C′N =    r=1   M + 1 − r Pr  rPr = M + 1 − M  M = M + 1 − M = M + 1 − M  r=1  M + 1 − r    M  M − r  M   M + 1 − r  M   M + 1 = M + 1 −  M − N  M − N + 1 M−N +1 = M + 1 = M + 1 −  M − N  M + 1 M−N +1 ,  M − N − 1   M − N   M − N  r=1  r=1  N  N  N  for 1 ≤ N < M.   32    We have already solved essentially the same problem in connection with random sampling, in exercise 3.4.2–5.  Setting α = N M, this exact formula for C′N is approximately equal to  1  1 − α  = 1 + α + α2 + α3 + ··· ,   33    34   a series that has a rough intuitive interpretation: With probability α we need more than one probe, with probability α2 we need more than two, etc. The corresponding average number of probes for a successful search is 1    N−1   1 M + 1 + 1 HM+1 − HM−N+1  M  + ··· +   ≈ 1  α  M − N + 2  ln  1  1 − α  .

In fact, double hashing is asymptotically equivalent to uniform probing, in the limit as M → ∞  see exercise 70 .  This completes our analysis of uniform probing.  In order to study linear probing and other types of collision resolution, we need to set up the theory in a different, more realistic way. The probabilistic model we shall use for this purpose assumes that each of the M N possible “hash sequences”  0 ≤ aj < M,  a1 a2 . . . aN ,   35  is equally likely, where aj denotes the initial hash address of the jth key inserted into the table. The average number of probes in a successful search, given any particular searching algorithm, will be denoted by CN as above; this is assumed to be the average number of probes needed to find the kth key, averaged over 1 ≤ k ≤ N with each key equally likely, and averaged over all hash sequences  35  with each sequence equally likely. Similarly, the average number of probes needed   6.4   36    37   536  SEARCHING  when the Nth key is inserted, considering all sequences  35  to be equally likely, will be denoted by C′N−1; this is the average number of probes in an unsuccessful search starting with N − 1 elements in the table. When open addressing is used,  N−1  k=0  C′k,  CN = 1  N  so that we can deduce one quantity from the other as we have done in  34 .  Strictly speaking, there are two defects even in this more accurate model. In the first place, the different hash sequences aren’t all equally probable, because the keys themselves are distinct. This makes the probability that a1 = a2 slightly less than 1 M; but the difference is usually negligible since the set of all possible keys is typically very large compared to M.  See exercise 24.  Furthermore a good hash function will exploit the nonrandomness of typical data, making it even less likely that a1 = a2; as a result, our estimates for the number of probes will be pessimistic. Another inaccuracy in the model is indicated in Fig. 43: Keys that occur earlier are  with some exceptions  more likely to be looked up than keys that occur later. Therefore our estimate of CN tends to be doubly pessimistic, and the algorithms should perform slightly better in practice than our analysis predicts.  With these precautions, we are ready to make an “exact” analysis of linear probing.* Let f M, N  be the number of hash sequences  35  such that position 0 of the table will be empty after the keys have been inserted by Algorithm L. The circular symmetry of linear probing implies that position 0 is empty just as often as any other position, so it is empty with probability 1 − N M; in other words      f M, N  =  1 − N M  M N .  By convention we also set f 0, 0  = 1. Now let g M, N, k  be the number of hash sequences  35  such that the algorithm leaves position 0 empty, positions 1 through k occupied, and position k + 1 empty. We have  g M, N, k  =  f k+1, k f M−k−1, N−k ,   38    N    k  because all such hash sequences are composed of two subsequences, one  con- taining k elements ai ≤ k  that leaves position 0 empty and positions 1 through k occupied and one  containing N − k elements aj ≥ k + 1  that leaves po- sition k + 1 empty; there are f k+1, k  subsequences of the former type and  f M−k−1, N−k  of the latter type, and there areN   ways to intersperse two  such subsequences. Finally let Pk be the probability that exactly k + 1 probes will be needed when the  N + 1 st key is inserted; it follows  see exercise 25   k  * The author cannot resist inserting a biographical note at this point: I first formulated the following derivation in 1962, shortly after beginning work on The Art of Computer Pro- gramming.

The lower bound is a better approximation than the upper bound.  When α approaches 1, these formulas become useless, but fortunately Q0 M, M−1  is the function Q M  whose asymptotic behavior was studied in great detail in Section 1.2.11.3; and Q1 M, M−1  is simply equal to M  see exercise 50 .

Schay, Jr. and W. G. Spruth [CACM 5  1962 , 459–462]. Although their method yielded only an approximation to the exact formulas in Theorem K, it sheds further light on the algorithm, so we shall sketch it briefly here. First let us consider a surprising property of linear probing that was first noticed by W. W. Peterson in 1957: Theorem P. The average number of probes in a successful search by Algo- rithm L is independent of the order in which the keys were inserted; it depends only on the number of keys that hash to each address.  In other words, any rearrangement of a hash sequence a1 a2 . . . aN yields a hash sequence with the same average displacement of keys from their hash addresses.  We are assuming, as stated earlier, that all keys in the table have equal importance. If some keys are more frequently accessed than others, the proof can be extended to show that an optimal arrangement occurs if we insert them in decreasing order of frequency, using the method of Theorem 6.1S.  Proof. It suffices to show that the total number of probes needed to insert keys for the hash sequence a1 a2 . . . aN is the same as the total number needed for a1 . . . ai−1 ai+1 ai ai+2 . . . aN, 1 ≤ i < N. There is clearly no difference unless the  i + 1 st key in the second sequence falls into the position occupied by the ith in the first sequence. But then the ith and  i + 1 st merely exchange places, so the number of probes for the  i + 1 st is decreased by the same amount that the number for the ith is increased.  Theorem P tells us that the average search length for a hash sequence a1 a2 . . . aN can be determined from the numbers b0 b1 . . . bM−1, where bj is the number of a’s that equal j. From this sequence we can determine the “carry sequence” c0 c1 . . . cM−1, where cj is the number of keys for which both locations j and j − 1 are probed as the key is inserted. This sequence is determined by the rule  cj =  bj + c j+1  mod M − 1, otherwise.  if bj = c j+1  mod M = 0;   44    0,  For example, let M = 10, N = 8, and b0 . . . b9 = 0 3 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 2; then c0 . . . c9 = 2 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 3, since one key needs to be “carried over” from position 2 to position 1, three from position 1 to position 0, two of these from position 0 to position 9, etc. We have b0 + b1 +··· + bM−1 = N, and the average number of probes needed for retrieval of the N keys is 1 +  c0 + c1 + ··· + cM−1  N.  45  Rule  44  seems to be a circular definition of the c’s in terms of themselves, but actually there is a unique solution to the stated equations whenever N < M  see exercise 32 .  Schay and Spruth used this idea to determine the probability qk that cj = k, in terms of the probability pk that bj = k.  These probabilities are independent   6.4  of j.  Thus  HASHING  539   46    47    48    49    50    51   q0 = p0q0 + p1q0 + p0q1, q1 = p2q0 + p1q1 + p0q2, q2 = p3q0 + p2q1 + p1q2 + p0q3,  bj + c j+1  mod M = 3. Let B z  = pkzk and C z  = qkzk be the generating  etc., since, for example, the probability that cj = 2 is the probability that  functions for these probability distributions; the equations  46  are equivalent to  B z C z  = p0q0 +  q0 − p0q0 z + q1z2 + ··· = p0q0 1 − z  + zC z . Since B 1  = 1, we may write B z  = 1 +  z − 1 D z , and it follows that  C z  = p0q0  1 − D z  = 1 − D 1  1 − D z  ,  since C 1  = 1. The average number of probes needed for retrieval, according to  45 , will therefore be  1 + M N  C′ 1  = 1 + M N  D′ 1  1 − D 1  = 1 + M 2N  B′′ 1  1 − B′ 1  .  Since we are assuming that each hash sequence a1 . . . aN is equally likely, we have  pk = Pr exactly k of the ai are equal to j, for fixed j   k  1 − 1  M  N−k;   N  k  =   1 N  M  ,    B z  =  1 + z − 1  M  hence  and the average number of probes according to  48  will be  B′ 1  = N M  ,    CN = 1 2  1 + M − 1 M − N  .  B′′ 1  = N N − 1    M 2  ,  Can the reader spot the incorrect reasoning that has caused this answer to be different from the correct result in Theorem K?  See exercise 33.  *Optimality considerations. We have seen several examples of probe sequences for open addressing, and it is natural to ask for one that can be proved best possible in some meaningful sense. This problem has been set up in the follow- ing interesting way by J. D. Ullman [JACM 19  1972 , 569–575]: Instead of computing a hash address h K , we map each key K into an entire permutation of {0, 1, . . . , M−1}, which represents the probe sequence to use for K. Each of the M! permutations is assigned a probability, and the generalized hash function is supposed to select each permutation with that probability. The question is, “What assignment of probabilities to permutations gives the best performance,   540  SEARCHING  6.4  in the sense that the corresponding average number of probes CN or C′N is minimized?” For example, if we assign the probability 1 M! to each permutation, it is easy to see that we have exactly the behavior of uniform probing that we have analyzed above in  32  and  34 . However, Ullman found an example with M = 4 and N = 2 for which C′N is smaller than the value 5 3 obtained with uniform probing. His construction assigns zero probability to all but the following six permutations:  Permutation  0 1 2 3 2 0 1 3 3 0 1 2  Probability  1 + 2ϵ  6  1 − ϵ  6  1 − ϵ  6  Permutation  1 0 3 2 2 1 0 3 3 1 0 2  Probability  1 + 2ϵ  6  1 − ϵ  6  1 − ϵ  6   52   3 − 1  However, the corresponding value of C′1 for these probabilities is 23  Roughly speaking, the first probe tends to be either 2 or 3, but the second probe is always 0 or 1. The average number of probes needed to insert the third item, C′2, turns out to be 5 9 ϵ + O ϵ2 , so we can improve on uniform probing by taking ϵ to be a small positive value. 18 + O ϵ , which is larger than 5 4  the uniform probing value . Ullman proved that any assignment of probabilities such that C′N <  M + 1   M + 1 − N  for some N always implies that C′n >  M + 1   M + 1 − n  for some n < N; you can’t win all the time over uniform probing. Actually the number of probes CN for a successful search is a better measure than C′N. The permutations in  52  do not lead to an improved value of CN for any N, and indeed Ullman conjectured that no assignment of probabilities will  be able to make CN less than the uniform value M +1  N HM+1−HM+1−N .  Andrew Yao proved an asymptotic form of this conjecture by showing that the limiting cost when N = αM and M → ∞ is always ≥ 1 1−α [JACM 32  1985 , 687–693]. The strong form of Ullman’s conjecture appears to be very difficult to prove, especially because there are many ways to assign probabilities to achieve the effect of uniform probing; we do not need to assign 1 M! to each permutation. For example, the following assignment for M = 4 is equivalent to uniform probing:  α ln 1  Permutation  Probability  Permutation  Probability  0 1 2 3 1 2 3 0 2 3 0 1 3 0 1 2  1 6 1 6 1 6 1 6  0 2 1 3 1 3 2 0 2 0 3 1 3 1 0 2  1 12 1 12 1 12 1 12   53   with zero probability assigned to the other 16 permutations.  The following theorem characterizes all assignments that produce the be-  havior of uniform probing. Theorem U. An assignment of probabilities to permutations will make each   configurations of empty and occupied cells equally likely after N  of the M  N   6.4  HASHING  541  N  , for all N and for all N-element sets.  insertions, for 0 < N < M, if and only if the sum of probabilities assigned to all permutations whose first N elements are the members of a given N-element set  is 1 M mutations beginning with the numbers {0, 1, 2} in some order must be 1 M  For example, the sum of probabilities assigned to each of the 3!

Let A ⊆ {0, 1, . . . , M−1}, and let Π A  be the set of all permutations whose first A elements are members of A; also let S A  be the sum of the probabilities assigned to those permutations. Let Pk A  be the probability that the first A insertions of the open addressing procedure occupy the locations specified by A, and that the last insertion required exactly k probes. Finally, let P A  = P1 A  + P2 A  + ··· . The proof is by induction on N ≥ 1, assuming that   =  3  for all sets A with A = n < N. Let B be any N-element set.

Hashing techniques lend themselves well to external searching on direct-access storage devices like disks or drums. For such ap- plications, as in Section 6.2.4, we want to minimize the number of accesses to the file, and this has two major effects on the choice of algorithms: 1  It is reasonable to spend more time computing the hash function, since the penalty for bad hashing is much greater than the cost of the extra time needed to do a careful job.  2  The records are usually grouped into pages or buckets, so that several records  are fetched from the external memory each time.   542  SEARCHING  6.4  The file is divided into M buckets containing b records each. Collisions now cause no problem unless more than b keys have the same hash address. The following three approaches to collision resolution seem to be best: A  Chaining with separate lists. If more than b records fall into the same bucket, a link to an overflow record can be inserted at the end of the first bucket. These overflow records are kept in a special overflow area. There is usually no advantage in having buckets in the overflow area, since comparatively few overflows occur; thus, the extra records are usually linked together so that the  b + k th record of a list requires 1 + k accesses. It is usually a good idea to leave some room for overflows on each cylinder of a disk file, so that most accesses are to the same cylinder.  Although this method of handling overflows seems inefficient, the number of overflows is statistically small enough that the average search time is very good. See Tables 2 and 3, which show the average number of accesses required as a function of the load factor   54  for fixed α as M, N → ∞. Curiously when α = 1 the asymptotic number of accesses for an unsuccessful search increases with increasing b.  α = N M b,  Table 2  50%  40%  30%  20%  AVERAGE ACCESSES IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL SEARCH BY SEPARATE CHAINING Bucket size, b  Load factor, α  10% 60% 70% 80% 90% 95% 1.0048 1.0187 1.0408 1.0703 1.1065 1.1488 1.197 1.249 1.307 1.34 1.0012 1.0088 1.0269 1.0581 1.1036 1.1638 1.238 1.327 1.428 1.48 1.0003 1.0038 1.0162 1.0433 1.0898 1.1588 1.252 1.369 1.509 1.59 1.0001 1.0016 1.0095 1.0314 1.0751 1.1476 1.253 1.394 1.571 1.67 1.0000 1.0007 1.0056 1.0225 1.0619 1.1346 1.249 1.410 1.620 1.74 1.0000 1.0000 1.0004 1.0041 1.0222 1.0773 1.201 1.426 1.773 2.00 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0001 1.0028 1.0234 1.113 1.367 1.898 2.29 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0007 1.018 1.182 1.920 2.70  1 2 3 4 5 10 20 50  Table 3  Load factor, α  AVERAGE ACCESSES IN A SUCCESSFUL SEARCH BY SEPARATE CHAINING  Bucket size, b  1 2 3 4 5 10 20 50  30%  50%  40%  20%  10% 60% 70% 80% 90% 95% 1.0500 1.1000 1.1500 1.2000 1.2500 1.3000 1.350 1.400 1.450 1.48 1.0063 1.0242 1.0520 1.0883 1.1321 1.1823 1.238 1.299 1.364 1.40 1.0010 1.0071 1.0215 1.0458 1.0806 1.1259 1.181 1.246 1.319 1.36 1.0002 1.0023 1.0097 1.0257 1.0527 1.0922 1.145 1.211 1.290 1.33 1.0000 1.0008 1.0046 1.0151 1.0358 1.0699 1.119 1.186 1.268 1.32 1.0000 1.0000 1.0002 1.0015 1.0070 1.0226 1.056 1.115 1.206 1.27 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0005 1.0038 1.018 1.059 1.150 1.22 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.001 1.015 1.083 1.16   6.4  HASHING  543  B  Chaining with coalescing lists. Instead of providing a separate overflow area, we can adapt Algorithm C to external files. A doubly linked list of available space can be maintained for each cylinder, linking together each bucket that is not yet full. Under this scheme, every bucket contains a count of how many record positions are empty, and the bucket is removed from the doubly linked list only when its count becomes zero. A “roving pointer” can be used to distribute overflows  see exercise 2.5–6 , so that different chains tend to use different overflow buckets. This method has not yet been analyzed, but it might prove to be quite useful. C  Open addressing. We can also do without links, using an “open” method. Linear probing is probably better than random probing when we consider exter- nal searching, because the increment c can often be chosen so that it minimizes latency delays between consecutive accesses. The approximate theoretical model of linear probing that was worked out above can be generalized to account for the influence of buckets, and it shows that linear probing is indeed satisfactory unless the table has gotten very full. For example, see Table 4; when the load factor is 90 percent and the bucket size is 50, the average number of accesses in a successful search is only 1.04.

Since chaining method  A  requires a separate overflow area, we need to estimate how many overflows will occur. The average number of overflows will be M C′N − 1  = N tb α , since C′N − 1 is the average number of overflows in any given list. Therefore Table 2 can be used to deduce the amount of overflow space required. For fixed α, the standard deviation of the total number of overflows will be roughly proportional to  √ M as M → ∞.  Asymptotic values for C′N and CN appear in exercise 53, but the approxi- mations aren’t very good when b is small or α is large; fortunately the series for R α, n  converges rather rapidly even when α is large, so the formulas can be evaluated to any desired precision without much difficulty. The maximum values occur for α = 1, when  max C′N = 1 + e−bbb+1 b! max CN = 1 + e−bbb 2b!  b 2π  =  R b  + 1 = 5 4 +   2  + 1 + O b−1 2 ,   60  as b → ∞, by Stirling’s approximation and the analysis of the function R n  = R 1, n  − 1 in Section 1.2.11.3.  + O b−1 ,  The average number of accesses in a successful external search with linear  9πb   59   probing has the remarkably simple expression  CN ≈ 1 + tb α  + t2b α  + t3b α  + ··· ,   61  which can be understood as follows: The average total number of accesses to look up all N keys is N CN, and this is N + T1 + T2 +··· , where Tk is the average number of keys that require more than k accesses. Theorem P says that we can enter the keys in any order without affecting CN, and it follows that Tk is the average number of overflow records that would occur in the chaining method if we had M k buckets of size kb, namely N tkb α  by what we said above. Further justification of Eq.  61  appears in exercise 55.  An excellent early discussion of practical considerations involved in the de- sign of external hash tables was given by Charles A. Olson, Proc. ACM Nat. Conf. 24  1969 , 539–549. He included several worked examples and pointed out that the number of overflow records will increase substantially if the file is subject to frequent insertion deletion activity without relocating records. He also presented an analysis of this situation that was obtained jointly with J. A. de Peyster.   6.4  HASHING  545  Fig. 44.

We have now studied a large number of techniques for searching; how can we select the right one for a given application? It is difficult to summarize in a few words all the relevant details of the trade-offs involved in the choice of a search method, but the following things seem to be of primary importance with respect to the speed of searching and the requisite storage space.  Figure 44 summarizes the analyses of this section, showing that the various methods for collision resolution lead to different numbers of probes.

Linear probing accesses the table more frequently than the other methods shown in Fig. 44, but it has the advantage of simplicity. Furthermore, even linear probing isn’t terribly bad: When the table is 90 percent full, Algorithm L requires fewer than 5.5 probes, on the average, to locate a random item in the table.  However, a 90-percent-full table does require about 50.5 probes for every new item inserted by Algorithm L.   Figure 44 shows that the chaining methods are quite economical with re- spect to the number of probes, but the extra memory space needed for link fields sometimes makes open addressing more attractive for small records. For example, if we have to choose between a chained hash table of capacity 500 and an open hash table of capacity 1000, the latter is clearly preferable, since it allows efficient searching when 500 records are present and it is capable of absorbing twice as much data. On the other hand, sometimes the record size and format will allow space for link fields at virtually no extra cost.  See exercise 65.   How do hash methods compare with the other search strategies we have studied in this chapter? From the standpoint of speed we can argue that they are better, when the number of records is large, because the average search time for a hash method stays bounded as N → ∞ if we stipulate that the table never gets too full. For example, Program L will take only about 55 units of time for a successful search when the table is 90 percent full; this beats the fastest MIX binary search routine we have seen  exercise 6.2.1–24  when N is greater than 600 or so, at the cost of only 11 percent in storage space. Moreover the binary search is suitable only for fixed tables, while a hash table allows efficient insertions.  We can also compare Program L to the tree-oriented search methods that allow dynamic insertions. Program L with a 90-percent-full table is faster than Program 6.2.2T when N is greater than about 90, and faster than Program 6.3D  exercise 6.3–9  when N is greater than about 75.  Only one search method in this chapter is efficient for successful searching with virtually no storage overhead, namely Brent’s variation of Algorithm D. His method allows us to put N records into a table of size M = N + 1, and to find any record in about 2.5 probes on the average. No extra space for link fields or tag bits is needed; however, an unsuccessful search will be very slow, requiring about N 2 probes.  Thus hashing has several advantages. On the other hand, there are three  important respects in which hash table searching is inferior to other methods:  a  After an unsuccessful search in a hash table, we know only that the desired key is not present. Search methods based on comparisons always yield more information; they allow us to find the largest key ≤ K and or the smallest key ≥ K. This is important in many applications; for example, it allows us to interpolate function values from a stored table. We can also use comparison- based algorithms to locate all keys that lie between two given values K and K′. Furthermore the tree search algorithms of Section 6.2 make it easy to traverse the contents of a table in ascending order, without sorting it separately.   6.4  HASHING  547  b  The storage allocation for hash tables is often somewhat difficult; we have to dedicate a certain area of the memory for use as the hash table, and it may not be obvious how much space should be allotted. If we provide too much memory, we may be wasting storage at the expense of other lists or other computer users; but if we don’t provide enough room, the table will overflow. By contrast, the tree search and insertion algorithms deal with trees that grow no larger than necessary. In a virtual memory environment we can keep memory accesses localized if we use tree search or digital tree search, instead of creating a large hash table that requires the operating system to access a new page nearly every time we hash a key.  c  Finally, we need a great deal of faith in probability theory when we use hashing methods, since they are efficient only on the average, while their worst case is terrible! As in the case of random number generators, we can never be completely sure that a hash function will perform properly when it is applied to a new set of data. Therefore hash tables are inappropriate for certain real- time applications such as air traffic control, where people’s lives are at stake; the balanced tree algorithms of Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 are much safer, since they provide guaranteed upper bounds on the search time. History. The idea of hashing appears to have been originated by H. P. Luhn, who wrote an internal IBM memorandum in January 1953 that suggested the use of chaining; in fact, his suggestion was one of the first applications of linked linear lists. He pointed out the desirability of using buckets that contain more than one element, for external searching. Shortly afterwards, A. D. Lin carried Luhn’s analysis further, and suggested a technique for handling overflows that used “degenerative addresses”; for example, the overflows from primary bucket 2748 were put in secondary bucket 274; overflows from that bucket went to tertiary bucket 27, and so on, assuming the presence of 10000 primary buckets, 1000 secondary buckets, 100 tertiary buckets, etc. The hash functions originally suggested by Luhn were digital in nature; for example, he combined adjacent pairs of key digits by adding them mod 10, so that 31415926 would be compressed to 4548.  At about the same time the idea of hashing occurred independently to another group of IBMers: Gene M. Amdahl, Elaine M. Boehm, N. Rochester, and Arthur L. Samuel, who were building an assembly program for the IBM 701. In order to handle the collision problem, Amdahl originated the idea of open addressing with linear probing. [See also Derr and Luke, JACM 3  1956 , 303.] Hash coding was first described in the open literature by Arnold I. Dumey, Computers and Automation 5, 12  December 1956 , 6–9. He was the first to mention the idea of dividing by a prime number and using the remainder as the hash address. Dumey’s interesting article mentions chaining but not open addressing. A. P. Ershov of Russia independently discovered linear open ad- dressing in 1957 [Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR 118  1958 , 427–430]; he published empirical results about the number of probes, conjecturing correctly that the average number of probes per successful search is < 2 when N M < 2 3.   548  SEARCHING  6.4  A classic article by W. W. Peterson, IBM J. Research & Development 1  1957 , 130–146, was the first major paper dealing with the problem of search- ing in large files. Peterson defined open addressing in general, analyzed the performance of uniform probing, and gave numerous empirical statistics about the behavior of linear open addressing with various bucket sizes, noting the degradation in performance that occurred when items were deleted. Another comprehensive survey of the subject was published six years later by Werner Buchholz [IBM Systems J. 2  1963 , 86–111], who gave an especially good discussion of hash functions. Correct analyses of Algorithm L were first pub- lished by A. G. Konheim and B. Weiss, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 14  1966 , 1266– 1274; V. Podderjugin, Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Technischen Universität Dresden 17  1968 , 1087–1089.  Up to this time linear probing was the only type of open addressing scheme that had appeared in the literature, but another scheme based on repeated ran- dom probing by independent hash functions had independently been developed by several people  see exercise 48 . During the next few years hashing became very widely used, but hardly anything more was published about it. Then Robert Morris wrote a very influential survey of the subject [CACM 11  1968 , 38–44], in which he introduced the idea of random probing with secondary clustering. Morris’s paper touched off a flurry of activity that culminated in Algorithm D and its refinements.  It is interesting to note that the word “hashing” apparently never appeared in print, with its present meaning, until the late 1960s, although it had already become common jargon in several parts of the world by that time. The first published appearance of the word seems to have been in H. Hellerman’s book Digital Computer System Principles  New York: McGraw–Hill, 1967 , 152; the only previous occurrence among approximately 60 relevant documents studied by the author as this section was being written was in an unpublished memorandum written by W. W. Peterson in 1961. Somehow the verb “to hash” magically became standard terminology for key transformation during the mid-1960s, yet nobody was rash enough to use such an undignified word in print until 1967! Later developments. Many advances in the theory and practice of hashing have been made since the author first prepared this chapter in 1972, although the basic ideas discussed above still remain useful for ordinary applications. For example, the book Design and Analysis of Coalesced Hashing by J. S. Vitter and W.-C. Chen  New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1987  discusses and analyzes several instructive variants of Algorithm C.  From a practical standpoint, the most important hash technique invented in the late 1970s is probably the method that Witold Litwin called linear hashing [Proc. 6th International Conf. on Very Large Databases  1980 , 212–223]. Linear hashing — which incidentally has nothing to do with the classical technique of linear probing — allows the number of hash addresses to grow and or contract gracefully as items are inserted and or deleted. An excellent discussion of linear hashing, including comparisons with other methods for internal searching, has   6.4  HASHING  549  been given by Per-Åke Larson in CACM 31  1988 , 446–457; see also W. G. Griswold and G. M. Townsend, Software Practice & Exp. 23  1993 , 351–367, for improvements when many large and or small tables are present simultane- ously. Linear hashing can also be used for huge databases that are distributed between many different sites on a network [see Litwin, Neimat, and Schneider, ACM Trans. Database Syst. 21  1996 , 480–525]. An alternative scheme called extendible hashing, which has the property that at most two references to external pages are needed to retrieve any record, was proposed at about the same time by R. Fagin, J. Nievergelt, N. Pippenger, and H. R. Strong [ACM Trans. Database Syst. 4  1979 , 315–344]; related ideas had been explored by G. D. Knott, Proc. ACM-SIGFIDET Workshop on Data Description, Access and Control  1971 , 187–206. Both linear hashing and extendible hashing are preferable to the B- trees of Section 6.2.4, when the order of keys is unimportant.  In the theoretical realm, more complicated methods have been devised by which it is possible to guarantee O 1  maximum time per access, with O 1  average amortized time per insertion and deletion, regardless of the keys being examined; moreover, the total storage used at any time is bounded by a constant times the number of items currently present, plus another additive constant. This result, which builds on ideas of Fredman, Komlós, and Szemerédi [JACM 31  1984 , 538–544], is due to Dietzfelbinger, Karlin, Mehlhorn, Meyer auf der Heide, Rohnert, and Tarjan [SICOMP 23  1994 , 738–761].

[HM30]  Polynomial hashing.  The purpose of this exercise is to consider the construction of polynomials P  x  such as  10 , which convert n-bit keys into m-bit addresses, in such a way that distinct keys differing in t or fewer bits will hash to different addresses. Given n and t ≤ n, and given an integer k such that n divides 2k − 1, we shall construct a polynomial whose degree m is a function of n, t, and k.  Usually n is increased, if necessary, so that k can be chosen to be reasonably small.  Let S be the smallest set of integers such that {1, 2, . . . , t} ⊆ S and  2j  mod n ∈ S for all j ∈ S. For example, when n = 15, k = 4, and t = 6, we have S = {1, 2, 3, 4, j∈S x − αj , where α is an element of order n in the finite field GF 2k , and where the coefficients of P  x  are computed in this field. The degree m of P  x  is the number of elements of S. Since α2j is a root of P  x  whenever αj is a root, it follows that the coefficients pi of P  x  satisfy p2 Prove that if R x  = rn−1xn−1+···+r1x+r0 is any nonzero polynomial modulo 2, with at most t nonzero coefficients, then R x  is not a multiple of P  x  modulo 2. [It follows that the corresponding hash function behaves as advertised.] 8. [M34]  The three-distance theorem.  Let θ be an irrational number between 0 and 1, whose regular continued fraction representation in the notation of Section 4.5.3 is θ =   a1, a2, a3, . . .   . Let q0 = 0, p0 = 1, q1 = 1, p1 = 0, and qk+1 = akqk + qk−1, pk+1 = akpk + pk−1 for k ≥ 1. Let {x} denote x mod 1 = x − ⌊x⌋, and let {x}+ denote x − ⌈x⌉ + 1. As the points {θ},{2θ},{3θ}, . . . are successively inserted into the interval [0 . . 1], let the line segments be numbered as they appear in such a way that the first segment of a given length is number 0, the next is number 1, etc. Prove that the following statements are all true: Interval number s of length {tθ}, where t = rqk+qk−1 and 0 ≤ r < ak and k is even and 0 ≤ s < qk, has left endpoint {sθ} and right endpoint { s + t θ}+. Interval number s of length 1−{tθ}, where t = rqk + qk−1 and 0 ≤ r < ak and k is odd and 0 ≤ s < qk, has left endpoint { s + t θ} and right endpoint {sθ}+. Every positive integer n can be uniquely represented as n = rqk + qk−1 + s for some k ≥ 1, 1 ≤ r ≤ ak, and 0 ≤ s < qk. In terms of this representation, just before the point {nθ} is inserted the n intervals present are  the first s intervals  numbered 0, . . . , s − 1  of length { −1 k rqk + qk−1 θ}; the first n − qk intervals  numbered 0, . . . , n − qk − 1  of length { −1 k+1qkθ}; the last qk−s intervals  numbered s, . . . , qk−1  of length { −1 k  r−1 qk+qk−1 θ}+. The operation of inserting {nθ} removes interval number s of the third type and converts it into interval number s of the first type, number n − qk of the second type. 9. [M30] When we successively insert the points {θ}, {2θ}, . . . into the interval [0 . . 1], Theorem S asserts that each new point always breaks up one of the largest remaining intervals. If the interval [a . . c] is thereby broken into two parts [a . . b], [b . . c], we may call it a bad break if one of these parts is more than twice as long as the other, namely if b − a > 2 c − b  or c − b > 2 b − a . Prove that bad breaks will occur for some {nθ} unless θ mod 1 = ϕ−1 or ϕ−2; and  the latter values of θ never produce bad breaks. 10. [M38]  R. L. Graham.  If θ, α1, . . . , αd are real numbers with α1 = 0, and if n1, . . . , nd are positive integers, and if the points {nθ+αj} are inserted into the interval [0 . . 1] for 0 ≤ n < nj and 1 ≤ j ≤ d, prove that the resulting n1 + ··· + nd  possibly empty  intervals have at most 3d different lengths. 11.

Let h K  be a hash function, and let q K  be a function  jump instruction in the inner loop. Compare the running time of the modified program with the original.  of K such that K can be determined once h K  and q K  are given. For example, in division hashing we may let h K  = K mod M and q K  = ⌊K M⌋; in multiplicative hashing we may let h K  be the leading bits of  AK w  mod 1, and q K  can be the other bits.  551  Show that when chaining is used without overlapping lists, we need only store q K  instead of K in each record.  This almost saves the space needed for the link fields.  Modify Algorithm C so that it allows such abbreviated keys by avoiding overlapping lists, yet uses no auxiliary storage locations for overflow records. 14. [24]  E. W. Elcock.  Show that it is possible to let a large hash table share memory with any number of other linked lists. Let every word of the list area have a 2-bit TAG field and two link fields called LINK and AUX, with the following interpretation: TAG P  = 0 indicates a word in the list of available space; LINK P  points to the  next entry in this list, and AUX P  is unused.  TAG P  = 1 indicates a word in use where P is not the hash address of any key in the hash table; the other fields of the word in location P may have any desired format.  TAG P  = 2 indicates that P is the hash address of at least one key; AUX P  points to a linked list specifying all such keys, and LINK P  points to another word in the list memory. Whenever a word with TAG P  = 2 is accessed during the processing of any list, we set P ← LINK P  repeatedly until reaching a word with TAG P  ≤ 1.  For efficiency we might also then change prior links so that it will not be necessary to skip over the same entries again and again.  Define suitable algorithms for inserting and retrieving keys in such a hash table. 15. [16] Why is it a good idea for Algorithm L and Algorithm D to signal overflow when N = M − 1 instead of when N = M? 16. [10] Program L says that K should not be zero.

[M30] In the old days when computers were much slower than they are now, it was possible to watch the lights flashing and see how fast Algorithm L was running. When the table began to fill up, some entries would be processed very quickly, while others took a great deal of time.  This experience suggests that the standard deviation of the number of probes in an unsuccessful search is rather high, when linear probing is used. Find a formula that expresses the variance in terms of the Qr functions defined in Theorem K, and estimate the variance when N = αM as M → ∞. 29. [M21]  The parking problem.  A certain one-way street has m parking spaces in a row, numbered 1 through m. A man and his dozing wife drive by, and suddenly she wakes up and orders him to park immediately. He dutifully parks at the first available space; but if there are no places left that he can get to without backing up  that is, if his wife awoke when the car approached space k, but spaces k, k + 1, . . . , m are all full , he expresses his regrets and drives on.  Suppose, in fact, that this happens for n different cars, where the jth wife wakes up just in time to park at space aj. In how many of the sequences a1 . . . an will all of the cars get safely parked, assuming that the street is initially empty and that nobody leaves after parking? For example, when m = n = 9 and a1 . . . a9 = 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5, the cars get parked as follows:  [Hint: Use the analysis of linear probing.]  2  4  1  3  5  7  8  9  6   6.4  HASHING  553  30.

The object of this exercise is to determine the expected number of probes in the open addressing scheme with probe sequence  h K  + pM−1  mod M, h K , where p1 p2 . . . pM−1 is a randomly chosen permutation of {1, 2, . . . , M−1} that depends on h K . In other words, all keys with the same value of h K  follow the same probe sequence, and the  M − 1 !M possible choices of M probe sequences with this property are equally likely.   h K  + p2  mod M,   h K  + p1  mod M,  This situation can be modeled accurately by the following experimental procedure performed on an initially empty linear array of size m. Do the following operation n times: “With probability p, occupy the leftmost empty position. Otherwise  that is, with probability q = 1 − p , select any table position except the one at the extreme left, with each of these m − 1 positions equally likely. If the selected position is empty, occupy it; otherwise select any empty position  including the leftmost  and occupy it, considering each of the empty positions equally likely.”  For example, when m = 5 and n = 3, the array configuration after such an  experiment will be  occupied, occupied, empty, occupied, empty  with probability  . . . ,  7 192 qqq + 1  6 pqq + 1  6 qpq + 11  64 qqp + 1  3 ppq + 1  4 pqp + 1  4 qpp.   This procedure corresponds to random probing with secondary clustering, when p = 1 m, since we can renumber the table entries so that a particular probe sequence is 0, 1, 2, . . . and all the others are random.   Find a formula for the average number of occupied positions at the left of the array  namely 2 in the example above . Also find the asymptotic value of this quantity when p = 1 m, n = α m + 1 , and m → ∞. 45. [M43] Solve the analog of exercise 44 with tertiary clustering, when the probe sequence begins h1 K ,   h1 K  + h2 K   mod M, and the succeeding probes are ran- domly chosen depending only on h1 K  and h2 K .  Thus the  M −2 !M M−1  possible choices of M M − 1  probe sequences with this property are considered to be equally likely.  Is this procedure asymptotically equivalent to uniform probing? 46.

RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS We have now completed our study of searching for primary keys, namely for keys that uniquely specify a record in a file. But it is sometimes necessary to conduct a search based on the values of other fields in the records besides the primary key; these other fields are often called secondary keys or attributes of the record. For example, in an enrollment file that contains information about the students at a university, it may be desirable to search for all sophomores from Ohio who are not majoring in mathematics or statistics; or to search for all unmarried French-speaking graduate student women; etc.  In general, we assume that each record contains several attributes, and we want to search for all records that have certain values of certain attributes. The specification of the desired records is called a query. Queries are usually restricted to at most the following three types: a  A simple query that gives a specific value of a specific attribute; for example,  “MAJOR = MATHEMATICS”, or “RESIDENCE.STATE = OHIO”.  b  A range query that gives a specific range of values for a specific attribute;  for example, “COST < $18.00”, or “21 < AGE ≤ 23”.  c  A Boolean query that consists of the previous types combined with the  operations AND, OR, NOT; for example,  “ CLASS = SOPHOMORE  AND  RESIDENCE.STATE = OHIO   AND NOT   MAJOR = MATHEMATICS  OR  MAJOR = STATISTICS  ”.  The problem of discovering efficient search techniques for these three types of queries is already quite difficult, and therefore queries of more complicated types are usually not considered. For example, a railroad company might have a file giving the current status of all its freight cars; a query such as “find all empty refrigerator cars within 500 miles of Seattle” would not be explicitly allowed, unless “distance from Seattle” were an attribute stored within each record instead of a complicated function to be deduced from other attributes. And the use of logical quantifiers, in addition to AND, OR, and NOT, would introduce further complications, limited only by the imagination of the query-poser; given a file of baseball statistics, for example, we might ask for the longest consecutive hitting streak in night games. These examples are complicated, but they can still be handled by taking one pass through a suitably arranged file. Other queries are even more difficult — for example, to find all pairs of records that have the same values on five or more attributes  without specifying which attributes must match . Such queries may be regarded as general programming tasks that are beyond the scope of this discussion, although they can often be broken down into subproblems of the kind considered here.  Before we begin to study the various techniques for secondary key retrieval, it is important to put the subject in a proper economic context. Although a vast number of applications fit into the general framework of the three types of queries outlined above, not many of these applications are really suited to the sophisticated techniques we shall be studying, and some of them are better done   560  SEARCHING  6.5  by hand than by machine! People climb Mt. Everest “because it is there” and because tools have been developed that make the climb possible; similarly, when faced with a mountain of data, people are tempted to use a computer to find the answer to the most difficult queries they can dream up, in an online real-time environment, without properly balancing the cost. The desired calculations are possible, but they’re not right for everyone’s application.  For example, consider the following simple approach to secondary key re- trieval: After batching a number of queries, we can do a sequential search through the entire file, retrieving all the relevant records.  “Batching” means that we accumulate a number of queries before doing anything about them.  This method is quite satisfactory if the file isn’t too large and if the queries don’t have to be handled immediately. It can be used even with tape files, and it only ties up the computer at odd intervals, so it will tend to be very economical in terms of equipment costs. Moreover, it will even handle computational queries of the “distance to Seattle” type discussed above.  Another simple way to facilitate secondary key retrieval is to let people do part of the work, by providing them with suitable printed indexes to the information. This method is often the most reasonable and economical way to proceed  provided, of course, that the old paper is recycled whenever a new index is printed , especially because people tend to notice interesting patterns when they have convenient access to masses of data.  The applications that are not satisfactorily handled by the simple schemes given above involve very large files for which quick responses to queries are im- portant. Such a situation would occur, for example, if the file were continuously being queried by a number of simultaneous users, or if the queries were being generated by machine instead of by people. Our goal in this section will be to see how well we can do secondary key retrieval with conventional computers, under various assumptions about the file structure. Fortunately, the methods we will discuss are becoming more and more feasible in practice, as the cost of computation continues to decrease dramatically.  A lot of good ideas have been developed for dealing with the problem, but  as the reader will have guessed from all these precautionary remarks  the algorithms are by no means as good as those available for primary key retrieval. Because of the wide variety of files and applications, we will not be able to give a complete discussion of all the possibilities that have been considered, or to analyze the behavior of each algorithm in typical environments. The remainder of this section presents the basic approaches that have been proposed, and it is left to the reader’s imagination to decide what combination of techniques is most appropriate in each particular case.  Inverted files. The first important class of techniques for secondary key re- trieval is based on the idea of an inverted file. This does not mean that the file is turned upside down; it means that the roles of records and attributes are reversed. Instead of listing the attributes of a given record, we list the records having a given attribute.   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  561  We encounter inverted files  under other names  quite often in our daily lives. For example, the inverted file corresponding to a Russian-English dictionary is an English-Russian dictionary. The inverted file corresponding to this book is the index that appears at the close of the book. Accountants traditionally use “double-entry bookkeeping,” where all transactions are entered both in a cash account and in a customer account, so that the current cash position and the current customer liability are both readily accessible.  In general, an inverted file usually doesn’t stand by itself; it is to be used together with the original uninverted file. It provides duplicate, redundant information in order to speed up secondary key retrieval. The components of an inverted file are called inverted lists, namely the lists of all records having a given value of some attribute.  Like all lists, the inverted lists can be represented in many ways within a computer, and different modes of representation are appropriate at different times. Some secondary key fields have only two values  for example, “SEX” , and the corresponding inverted lists are quite long; but other fields typically have a great many values with few duplications  for example, “PHONENUMBER” .  Imagine that we want to store the information in a telephone directory so that all entries can be retrieved on the basis of either name, phone number, or residence address. One solution is simply to make three separate files, oriented to retrieval on each type of key. Another idea is to combine the files, for example by making three hash tables that serve as the list heads for the chaining method. In the latter scheme, each record of the file would be an element of three lists, and it would therefore contain three link fields; this is the so-called multilist method illustrated in Fig. 13 of Section 2.2.6 and discussed further below. A third possibility is to combine the three files into one super file, by analogy with library card catalogues in which author cards, title cards, and subject cards are all alphabetized together.  A consideration of the format used in the index to this book leads to further ideas on inverted list representation. For secondary key fields in which there are typically five or so entries per attribute value, we can simply make a short sequential list of the record locations  analogous to page locations in a book index , following the key value. If related records tend to be clustered consecutively, a range specification code  for example, pages 559–582  is useful. If the records in the file tend to be reallocated frequently, it may be better to use primary keys instead of record locations in the inverted files, so that no updating needs to be done when the locations change; for example, references to Bible passages are always given by chapter and verse, and the index to some books is based on paragraph numbers instead of page numbers.  None of these ideas is especially appropriate for the case of a two-valued attribute like “SEX”. In such a case only one inverted list is needed, of course, since the non-males will be female and conversely. If each value relates to about half the items of the file, the inverted list will be horribly long, but we can solve the problem rather nicely on a binary computer by using a bit string representation, with each bit specifying the value of a particular record. Thus   562  SEARCHING  6.5  the bit string 01001011101 . . . might mean that the first record in the file refers to a male, the second female, the next two male, etc.  Such methods suffice to handle simple queries about specific attribute val- ues. A slight extension makes it possible to treat range queries, except that a comparison-based search scheme  Section 6.2  must be used instead of hashing. For Boolean queries like “ MAJOR = MATHEMATICS  AND  RESIDENCE.STATE = OHIO ”, we need to intersect two inverted lists. This can be done in several ways; for example, if both lists are ordered, one pass through each will pick out all common entries. Alternatively, we could select the shortest list and look up each of its records, checking the other attributes; but this method works only for AND’s, not for OR’s, and it is unattractive on external files because it requires many accesses to records that will not satisfy the query.  The same considerations show that a multilist organization as described above is inefficient for Boolean queries on an external file, since it implies many unnecessary accesses. For example, imagine what would happen if the index to this book were organized in a multilist manner: Each entry of the index would refer only to the last page on which its particular subject was mentioned; then on every page there would be a further reference, for each subject on that page, to the previous occurrence of that subject. In order to find all pages relevant to “[Analysis of algorithms] and [ External sorting  or  External searching ]”, we would need to turn many pages. On the other hand, the same query can be resolved by looking at only two pages of the real index as it actually appears, doing simple operations on the inverted lists in order to find the small subset of pages that satisfy the query.  When an inverted list is represented as a bit string, Boolean combina- tions of simple queries are, of course, easily performed, because computers can manipulate bit strings at relatively high speed. For mixed queries in which some attributes are represented as sequential lists of record numbers while other attributes are represented as bit strings, it is not difficult to convert the sequential lists into bit strings, then to perform the Boolean operations on these bit strings. A quantitative example of a hypothetical application may be helpful at this point. Assume that we have 1,000,000 records of 40 characters each, and that our file is stored on MIXTEC disks, as described in Section 5.4.9. The file itself therefore fills two disk units, and the inverted lists will probably fill several more. Each track contains 5000 characters = 30,000 bits, so an inverted list for a particular attribute will take up at most 34 tracks.  This maximum number of tracks occurs when the bitstring representation is the shortest possible one.  Suppose that we have a rather involved query that refers to a Boolean combination of 10 inverted lists; in the worst case we will have to read 340 tracks of information from the inverted file, for a total read time of 340×25 ms = 8.5 sec. The average latency delay will be about one half of the read time, but by careful programming we may be able to eliminate the latency. By storing the first track of each bitstring list in one cylinder, and the second track of each list in the next, etc., most of the seek time will be eliminated, so we can estimate the maximum seek time as about 34 × 26 ms ≈ 0.9 sec  or twice this if two independent disk   6.5  563  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  q ×60 ms  seek  + 12.5 ms  latency  + 0.2 ms  read  extra time to fetch each  units are involved . Finally, if q records satisfy the query, we will need about  one for subsequent processing. Thus an optimistic estimate of the total expected time to process this rather complicated query is roughly  10 + .073q  seconds. This may be contrasted with about 210 seconds to read through the entire file at top speed under the same assumptions without using any inverted lists.  This example shows that space optimization is closely related to time opti- mization in a disk memory; the time to process the inverted lists is roughly the time needed to seek and to read them.  The discussion above has more or less assumed that the file is not growing or shrinking as we query it; what should we do if frequent updates are necessary? In many applications it is sufficient to batch a number of requests for updates, and to take care of them in dull moments when no queries need to be answered. Alternatively, if updating the file has high priority, the method of B-trees  Sec- tion 6.2.4  is attractive. The entire collection of inverted lists could be made into one huge B-tree, with special conventions for the leaves so that the branch nodes contain key values while the leaves contain both keys and lists of pointers of records. File updates can also be handled by other methods that we shall discuss below. Geometric data. A great many applications deal with points, lines, and shapes in spaces of two or more dimensions. One of the first approaches to distance- oriented queries was the “post-office tree” proposed in 1972 by Bruce McNutt. Suppose, for example, that we wish to handle queries like “What is the nearest city to point x?”, given the value of x. Each node of McNutt’s tree corresponds to a city y and a “test radius” r; the left subtree of this node corresponds to all cities z entered subsequently into this part of the tree such that the distance from y to z is ≤ r + δ, and the right subtree similarly is for distances ≥ r − δ. Here δ is a given tolerance; cities between r − δ and r + δ away from y must be entered in both subtrees. Searching in such a tree makes it possible to locate all cities within distance δ of a given point.  See Fig. 45.   Fig. 45. The top levels of an example “post-office tree.” To search for all cities near a given point x, start at the root: If x is within 1800 miles of Las Vegas, go left, otherwise go to the right; then repeat the process until encountering a terminal node. The method of tree construction ensures that all cities within 20 miles of x will be encountered during this search.  Las Vegas NV  1800 mi  Wichita Falls TX  1206 mi  Waterbury CT  1026 mi  Davenport IA  808 mi  Sacramento CA  687 mi  Rochester NY  687 mi  Tampa FL 1026 mi  Lexington KY  541 mi  Boise ID 460 mi  Eugene OR  460 mi  Bellingham WA  Worcester MA  Jacksonville FL  687 mi  460 mi  391 mi  Miami FL 687 mi   564  SEARCHING  6.5  Several experiments based on this idea were conducted by McNutt and Edward Pring, using the 231 most populous cities in the continental United States in random order as an example database. They let the test radii shrink in a regular manner, replacing r by 0.67r when going to the left, and by 0.57r when going to the right, except that r was left unchanged when taking the second of two consecutive right branches. The result was that 610 nodes were required in the tree for δ = 20 miles, and 1600 nodes were required for δ = 35 miles. The top levels of their smaller tree are shown in Fig. 45.  In the remaining levels of this tree, Orlando FL appeared below both Jacksonville and Miami. Some cities occurred quite often; for example, 17 of the nodes were for Brockton MA!   The rapid file growth as δ increases indicates that post-office trees probably have limited utility. We can do better by working directly with the coordinates of each point, regarding the coordinates as attributes or secondary keys; then we can make Boolean queries based on ranges of the keys. For example, suppose that the records of the file refer to North American cities, and that the query asks for all cities with   21.49◦ ≤ LATITUDE ≤ 37.41◦  AND  70.34◦ ≤ LONGITUDE ≤ 75.72◦ .  Reference to a map will show that many cities satisfy this LATITUDE range, and many satisfy the LONGITUDE range, but hardly any cities lie in both ranges. One approach to such orthogonal range queries is to partition the set of all possible LATITUDE and LONGITUDE values rather coarsely, with only a few classes per attribute  for example, by truncating to the next lower multiple of 5◦ , then to have one inverted list for each combined  LATITUDE, LONGITUDE  class. This is like having maps with one page for each local region. Using 5◦ intervals, the query above would refer to eight pages, namely  20◦, 70◦ ,  25◦, 70◦ , . . . ,  35◦, 75◦ . The range query needs to be processed for each of these pages, either by going to a finer partition within the page or by direct reference to the records themselves, depending on the number of records corresponding to that page. In a sense this is a tree structure with two-dimensional branching at each internal node.  A substantial elaboration of this approach, called a grid file, was developed by J. Nievergelt, H. Hinterberger, and K. C. Sevcik [ACM Trans. Database Systems 9  1984 , 38–71]. If each point x has k coordinates  x1, . . . , xk , they divide the ith coordinate values into ranges  −∞ = gi0 < gi1 < ··· < giri = +∞ and locate x by determining indices  j1, . . . , jk  such that   1   0 ≤ ji < ri,  for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.  giji ≤ xi < gi ji+1    2  All points that have a given value of  j1, . . . , jk  are called cells. Records for points in the same cell are stored in the same bucket in an external memory. Buckets are also allowed to contain points from several adjacent cells, provided that each bucket corresponds to a k-dimensional rectangular region or “super- cell.” Various strategies for updating the grid boundary values gij and for splitting or combining buckets are possible; see, for example, K. Hinrichs, BIT 25   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  565   1985 , 569–592. The characteristics of grid files with random data have been analyzed by M. Regnier, BIT 25  1985 , 335–357; P. Flajolet and C. Puech, JACM 33  1986 , 371–407, §4.2.  A simpler way to deal with orthogonal range queries was introduced by J. L. Bentley and R. A. Finkel, using structures called quadtrees [Acta Informatica 4  1974 , 1–9]. In the two-dimensional case of their construction, every node of such a tree represents a rectangle and also contains one of the points in that rectangle; there are four subtrees, corresponding to the four quadrants of the original rectangle relative to the coordinates of the given point. Similarly, in three dimensions there is eight-way branching, and the trees are sometimes called octrees. A k-dimensional quadtree has 2k-way branching.  The mathematical analysis of random quadtrees is quite difficult, but in 1988 the asymptotic form of the expected insertion time for the N-th node in a random k-dimensional quadtree was determined to be  2 k  ln N + O 1 ,   3    4   by two groups of researchers working independently: See L. Devroye and L. La- forest, SICOMP 19  1990 , 821–832; P. Flajolet, G. Gonnet, C. Puech, and J. M. Robson, Algorithmica 10  1993 , 473–500. Notice that when k = 1, this result agrees with the well-known formula for insertion into a binary search tree, Eq. 6.2.2– 5 . Further work by P. Flajolet, G. Labelle, L. Laforest, and B. Salvy showed in fact that the average internal path length can be expressed in the   N surprisingly elegant form      l  j=3   −1 l  1 − 2k jk    ,  l  l≥2  and further analysis of random quadtrees was therefore possible with the help of hypergeometric functions [see Random Structures & Algorithms 7  1995 , 117–144].  Bentley went on to simplify the quadtree representation even further by introducing “k-d trees,” which have only two-way branching at each node [CACM 18  1975 , 509–517; IEEE Transactions SE-5  1979 , 333–340]. A 1-d tree is just an ordinary binary search tree, as in Section 6.2.2; a 2-d tree is similar, but the nodes on even levels compare x-coordinates and the nodes on odd levels compare y-coordinates when branching. In general, a k-d tree has nodes with k coordinates, and the branching on each level is based on only one of the coordinates; for example, we might branch on coordinate number  l mod k  + 1 on level l. A tie-breaking rule based on a record’s serial number or location in memory can be used to ensure that no two records agree in any coordinate position. Randomly grown k-d trees turn out to have exactly the same average path length and shape distribution as ordinary binary search trees, because the assumptions underlying their growth are the same as in the one-dimensional case  see exercise 6.2.2–6 .   566  SEARCHING  6.5  If the file is not changing dynamically, we can balance any N-node k-d tree so that its height is ≈ lg N, by choosing a median value for branching at each node. Then we can be sure that several fundamental types of queries will be handled efficiently. For example, Bentley proved that we can identify all records that have t specified coordinates in O N 1−t k  steps. We can also find all records that lie in a given rectangular region in at most O tN 1−1 k + q  steps, if t of the coordinates are restricted to subranges and there are q such records altogether [D. T. Lee and C. K. Wong, Acta Informatica 23  1977 , 23–29]. In fact, if the given region is nearly cubical and q is small, and if the coordinate chosen for branching at each node has the greatest spread of attribute values, Friedman, Bentley, and Finkel [ACM Trans. Math. Software 3  1977 , 209–226] showed that the average time for such a region query will be only O log N + q . The same formula applies when searching such k-d trees for the nearest neighbor of a given point in k-dimensional space.  When k-d trees are random instead of perfectly balanced, the average run- ning time for partial matches of t specified coordinates increases slightly to Θ N 1−t k+f t k  ; here the function f is defined implicitly by the equation  f x  + 3 − xxf x  + 2 − x1−x = 2,   5   and it is quite small: We have  0 ≤ f x  < 0.06329 33881 23738 85718 14011 27797 33590 58170−,   6  and the maximum occurs when x is near 0.585. [See P. Flajolet and C. Puech, JACM 33  1986 , 371–407, §3.]  Because of the aesthetic appeal and great significance of geometric algo- rithms, there has been an enormous growth in techniques for solving higher- dimensional search problems and related questions of many kinds. Indeed, a new subfield of mathematics and computer science called Computational Ge- ometry has developed rapidly since the 1970s. The Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, edited by J. E. Goodman and J. O’Rourke  Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, 1997 , is an excellent reference to the state of the art in that field as of 1997.  A comprehensive survey of data structures and algorithms for the important special cases of two- and three-dimensional objects has been prepared by Hanan Samet in a pair of complementary books, The Design and Analysis of Spatial Data Structures and Applications of Spatial Data Structures  Addison–Wesley, 1990 . Samet points out that the original quadtrees of Bentley and Finkel are now more properly called “point quadtrees”; the name “quadtree” itself has become a generic term for any hierarchical decomposition of geometric data. Compound attributes. It is possible to combine two or more attributes into one super-attribute. For example, a  CLASS, MAJOR  attribute could be created by combining the CLASS and MAJOR fields of a university enrollment file. In this way queries can often be satisfied by taking the union of disjoint, short lists instead of the intersection of longer lists.   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  567  The idea of attribute combination was developed further by V. Y. Lum [CACM 13  1970 , 660–665], who suggested ordering the inverted lists of com- bined attributes lexicographically from left to right, and making multiple copies, with the individual attributes permuted in a clever way. For example, suppose that we have three attributes A, B, and C; we can form three compound attributes  7  and construct ordered inverted lists for each of these.  Thus in the first list, the records occur in order of their A values, with all records of the same A value in order by B and then by C.  This organization makes it possible to satisfy queries based on any combination of the three attributes; for example, all records having specified values for A and C will appear consecutively in the third list.   B, C, A ,   A, B, C ,   C, A, B   Similarly, from four attributes A, B, C, D, we can form the six combined  attributes   A, B, C, D ,  B, C, D, A ,  B, D, A, C ,  C, A, D, B ,  C, D, A, B ,  D, A, B, C ,  procedure for constructing n   combined attributes from n attributes, where   8  which suffice to answer all combinations of simple queries relating to the simul- taneous values of one, two, three, or four of the attributes. There is a general k ≤ 1 2 n, such that all records having specified combinations of at most k or at least n − k of the attribute values will appear consecutively in one of the combined attribute lists  see exercise 1 . Alternatively, we can get by with fewer combinations when some attributes have a limited number of values. For example, if D is simply a two-valued attribute, the three combinations  k   D, C, A, B    D, A, B, C ,   D, B, C, A ,   9  obtained by placing D in front of  7  will be almost as good as  8  with only half the redundancy, since queries that do not depend on D can be treated by looking in just two places in one of the lists. Binary attributes. It is instructive to consider the special case in which all attributes are two-valued. In a sense this is the opposite of combining attributes, since we can represent any value as a binary number and regard the individual bits of that number as separate attributes. Table 1 shows a typical file involving “yes-no” attributes; in this case the records stand for selected cookie recipes, and the attributes specify which ingredients are used. For example, Almond Lace Wafers are made from butter, flour, milk, nuts, and granulated sugar. If we think of Table 1 as a matrix of zeros and ones, the transpose of the matrix is the inverted file, in bitstring form.  The right-hand column of Table 1 is used to indicate special items that occur only rarely. These can be coded in a more efficient way than to devote an entire column to each one; and the “Cornstarch” column could be treated similarly. Dually, we could find a more efficient way to encode the “Flour” column, since flour occurs in everything except Meringues. For the present, however, let us sidestep these considerations and simply ignore the “Special ingredients” column.

Using “*” to stand for an arbitrary value, we can represent any basic query as a sequence of 0’s, 1’s, and *’s. For example, consider a man who is in the mood for some coconut cookies, but he is allergic to chocolate, hates anise, and has run out of vanilla extract; he can formulate the query  * 0 * * * * 0 * * 1 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 0.   10   Table 1 now says that Delicious Prune Bars are just the thing.  Before we consider the general problem of organizing a file for basic queries, it is important to look at the special case where no 0’s are specified, only 1’s and *’s. This may be called an inclusive query, because it asks for all records that include a certain set of attributes, if we assume that 1’s denote attributes that are present and 0’s denote attributes that are absent. For example, the recipes in Table 1 that call for both baking powder and baking soda are Glazed Gingersnaps and Old-Fashioned Sugar Cookies.  In some applications it is sufficient to provide for the special case of inclusive queries. This occurs, for example, in the case of many manual card-filing systems, such as “edge-notched cards” or “feature cards.” An edge-notched card system corresponding to Table 1 would have one card for every recipe, with holes cut out for each ingredient  see Fig. 46 . In order to process an inclusive query, the file of cards is arranged into a neat deck and needles are put in each column position corresponding to an attribute that is to be included. After raising the needles, all cards having the appropriate attributes will drop out.  Fig. 46. An edge-notched card.  A feature-card system works on the inverse file in a similar way.  In this case there is one card for every attribute, and holes are punched in designated positions on the surface of the card for every record possessing that attribute. An ordinary 80-column card can therefore be used to tell which of 12× 80 = 960  I  E S N A  I  E C P S L L A  R E D W O P  I  G N K A B  R E T T U B  M O M A D R A C  E T A L O C O H C  A D O S  I  G N K A B  N O M A N N C  I  S E V O L C  E E F F O C  T U N O C O C  S E T A D  K L O Y  G G E  I  E T H W G G E  H C R A T S N R O C  R U O L F  R E G N G  I  E C U J  I  N O M E L  L E E P  N O M E L  K L M  I  S T U N  G E M T U N  L A E M T A O  S E S S A L O M  T L A S  I  S N S A R  I  I  A L L N A V  I  L A C E P S  R A G U S  X X  R A G U S  .

To process an inclusive query, the feature cards for the specified attributes are selected and put together; then light will shine through all positions corresponding to the desired records. This operation is analogous to the treatment of Boolean queries by intersecting inverted bit strings as explained above.

The reason these manual card systems are of special interest to us is that ingenious schemes have been devised to save space on edge-notched cards; the same principles can be applied in the representation of computer files. Superimposed coding is a technique similar to hashing, and it was   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  571  actually invented several years before hashing itself was discovered. The idea is to map attributes into random k-bit codes in an n-bit field, and to superimpose the codes for each attribute that is present in a record. An inclusive query for some set of attributes can be converted into an inclusive query for the corresponding superimposed bit codes. A few extra records may satisfy this query, but the number of such “false drops” can be statistically controlled. [See Calvin N. Mooers, Amer. Chem. Soc. Meeting 112  September 1947 , 14E–15E; American Documentation 2  1951 , 20–32.]  As an example of superimposed coding, let’s consider Table 1 again, but only the flavorings instead of the basic ingredients like baking powder, shortening, eggs, and flour. Table 2 shows what happens if we assign random 2-bit codes in a 10-bit field to each of the flavoring attributes and superimpose the coding. For example, the entry for Chocolate Chip Cookies is obtained by superimposing the codes for chocolate, nuts, and vanilla:  0010001000  0000100100  0000001001 = 0010101101.  The superimposition of these codes also yields some spurious attributes, in this case allspice, candied cherries, currant jelly, peanut butter, and pepper; these will cause false drops to occur on certain queries  and they also suggest the creation of a new recipe called False Drop Cookies! .  Superimposed coding actually doesn’t work very well in Table 2, because that table is a small example with lots of attributes present. In fact, Applesauce- Spice Squares will drop out for every query, since it was obtained by superim- posing seven codes that cover all ten positions; and Pfeffernuesse is even worse, obtained by superimposing twelve codes. On the other hand Table 2 works surprisingly well in some respects; for example, if we try the query “Vanilla extract”, only the record for Pfeffernuesse comes out as a false drop.   = 4960 different attributes, where each record is  a 32-bit field and a set of32  A more appropriate example of superimposed coding occurs if we have, say,  allowed to possess up to six attributes and each attribute is encoded by specifying 3 of the 32 bits. In this situation, if we assume that each record has six randomly selected attributes, the probability of a false drop in an inclusive query  3  on one attribute is on two attributes is on three attributes is on four attributes is on five attributes is on six attributes is  .07948358; .00708659; .00067094; .00006786; .00000728; .00000082.   11   Thus if there are M records that do not actually satisfy a two-attribute query, about .007M will have a superimposed code that spuriously matches all code bits of the two specified attributes.  These probabilities are computed in exercise 4.  The total number of bits needed in the inverted file is only 32 times the number of records, which is less than half the number of bits needed to specify the attributes themselves in the original file.   572  SEARCHING  6.5  If carefully selected nonrandom codes are used, it is possible to avoid false drops entirely in superimposed coding, as shown by W. H. Kautz and R. C. Singleton, IEEE Trans. IT-10  1964 , 363–377; one of their constructions ap- pears in exercise 16.  Malcolm C. Harrison [CACM 14  1971 , 777–779] has observed that super- imposed coding can be used to speed up text searching. Assume that we want to locate all occurrences of a particular string of characters in a long body of text, without building an extensive table as in Algorithm 6.3P; and assume, for example, that the text is divided into individual lines c1c2 . . . c50 of 50 characters each. Harrison suggests encoding each of the 49 pairs c1c2, c2c3, . . . , c49c50 by hashing each of them into a number between 0 and 127, say; then the “signature” of the line c1c2 . . . c50 is the string of 128 bits b0b1 . . . b127, where bi = 1 if and only if h cjcj+1  = i for some j.  If now we want to search for all occurrences of the word NEEDLE in a large text file called HAYSTACK, we simply look for all lines whose signature contains 1-bits in positions h NE , h EE , h ED , h DL , and h LE . Assuming that the hash function is random, the probability that a random line contains all these bits in its signature is only 0.00341  see exercise 4 ; hence the intersection of five inverted-list bit strings will rapidly identify all the lines containing NEEDLE, together with a few false drops.  The assumption of randomness is not really justified in this application, since typical text has so much redundancy; the distribution of adjacent letter pairs in English words is highly biased. For example, it will probably be very helpful to discard all pairs cjcj+1 containing a blank character, since blanks are usually much more common than any other symbol.  Another interesting application of superimposed coding to search problems has been suggested by Burton H. Bloom [CACM 13  1970 , 422–426]; his method actually applies to primary key retrieval, although it is most appropriate for us to discuss it in this section. Imagine a search application with a large database in which no calculation needs to be done if the search was unsuccessful. For example, we might want to check somebody’s credit rating or passport number, and if no record for that person appears in the file we don’t have to investigate further. Similarly in an application to computerized typesetting, we might have a simple algorithm that hyphenates most words correctly, but it fails on some 50,000 exceptional words; if we don’t find the word in the exception file we are free to use the simple algorithm.  In such situations it is possible to maintain a bit table in internal memory so that most keys not in the file can be recognized as absent without making any references to the external memory. Here’s how: Let the internal bit table be b0b1 . . . bM−1, where M is rather large. For each key Kj in the file, compute k independent hash functions h1 Kj , . . . , hk Kj , and set the corresponding k b’s equal to 1.  These k values need not be distinct.  Thus bi = 1 if and only if hl Kj  = i for some j and l. Now to determine if a search argument K is in the external file, first test whether or not bhl K  = 1 for 1 ≤ l ≤ k; if not, there is no need to access the external memory, but if so, a conventional search   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  573  will probably find K if k and M have been chosen properly. The chance of a false drop when there are N records in the file is approximately  1 − e−kN M k. In a sense, Bloom’s method treats the entire file as one record, with the primary keys as the attributes that are present, and with superimposed coding in a huge M-bit field.  Still another variation of superimposed coding has been developed by Rich- ard A. Gustafson [Ph.D. thesis  Univ. South Carolina, 1969 ]. Suppose that we have N records and that each record possesses six attributes chosen from a set of 10,000 possibilities. The records may, for example, stand for technical articles and the attributes may be keywords describing the article. Let h be a hash function that maps each attribute into a number between 0 and 15. If a record has attributes a1, a2, . . . , a6, Gustafson suggests mapping the record into the 16-bit number b0b1 . . . b15, where bi = 1 if and only if h aj  = i for some j; and furthermore if this method results in only k of the b’s equal to 1, for k < 6, another 6−k 1s are supplied by some random method  not necessarily depending   = 8008 sixteen-bit codes in which exactly  on the record itself . There are 16  six 1-bits are present, and with luck about N 8008 records will be mapped into each value. We can keep 8008 lists of records, directly calculating the address corresponding to b0b1 . . . b15 using a suitable formula. In fact, if the 1s occur in positions 0 ≤ p1 < p2 < ··· < p6, the function + ··· +   p6   p1   p2        +  6  1  2  6  3  will convert each string b0b1 . . . b15 into a unique number between 0 and 8007, as we have seen in exercises 1.2.6–56 and 2.2.6–7.  Now if we want to find all records having three particular attributes A1, A2, A3, we compute h A1 , h A2 , h A3 ; assuming that these three values are  distinct, we need only look at the records stored in the 13   = 286 lists whose  bit code b0b1 . . . b15 contains 1s in those three positions. In other words, only 286 8008 ≈ 3.5 percent of the records need to be examined in the search.  See the article by C. S. Roberts, Proc. IEEE 67  1979 , 1624–1642, for an excellent exposition of superimposed coding, together with an application to a large database of telephone-directory listings. An application to spelling-check software is discussed by J. K. Mullin and D. J. Margoliash, Software Practice & Exper. 20  1990 , 625–630. Combinatorial hashing. The idea underlying Gustafson’s method just de- scribed is to find some way to map the records into memory locations so that comparatively few locations are relevant to a particular query. But his method applies only to inclusive queries when the individual records possess few at- tributes. Another type of mapping, designed to handle arbitrary basic queries like  10  consisting of 0’s, 1’s, and *’s, was discovered by Ronald L. Rivest in 1971. [See SICOMP 5  1976 , 19–50.]  Suppose first that we wish to construct a crossword-puzzle dictionary for all six-letter words of English; a typical query asks for all words of the form N**D*E, say, and gets the reply {NEEDLE, NIDDLE, NODDLE, NOODLE, NUDDLE}. We   574  SEARCHING  6.5  can solve this problem nicely by keeping 212 lists, putting the word NEEDLE into list number  h N  h E  h E  h D  h L  h E .  Here h is a hash function taking each letter into a 2-bit value, and we get a 12-bit list address by putting the six bit-pairs together. Then the query N**D*E can be answered by looking through just 64 of the 4096 lists.  Similarly let’s suppose that we have 1,000,000 records each containing 10 secondary keys, where each secondary key has a fairly large number of possible values. We can map the records whose secondary keys are  K1, K2, . . . , K10  into the 20-bit number  h K1  h K2  . . . h K10 ,   12  where h is a hash function taking each secondary key into a 2-bit value, and  12  stands for the juxtaposition of these ten pairs of bits. This scheme maps 1,000,000 records into 220 = 1,048,576 possible values, and we can consider the total mapping as a hash function with M = 220; chaining can be used to resolve collisions. If we want to retrieve all records having specified values of any five secondary keys, we need to look at only 210 lists, corresponding to the five √ unspecified bit pairs in  12 ; thus only about 1000 = N records need to be examined on the average.  A similar approach was suggested by M. Arisawa, J. Inf. Proc. Soc. Japan 12  1971 , 163–167, and by B. Dwyer  unpublished . Dwyer suggested using a more flexible mapping than  12 , namely  h1 K1  + h2 K2  + ··· + h10 K10  mod M,  where M is any convenient number, and the hi are arbitrary hash functions possibly of the form wiKi for “random” wi.  Rivest has developed this idea further so that in many cases we have the following situation. Assume that there are N ≈ 2n records, each having m secondary keys. Each record is mapped into an n-bit hash address, in such a way that a query that leaves the values of k keys unspecified corresponds to approximately N k m hash addresses. All the other methods we have discussed in this section  except Gustafson’s  require order N steps for retrieval, although the constant of proportionality is small; for large enough N, Rivest’s method will be faster, and it requires no inverted files.  But we have to define an appropriate mapping before we can apply this technique. Here is an example with small parameters, when m = 4 and n = 3 and when all secondary keys are binary-valued; we can map 4-bit records into eight addresses as follows:  ∗ 0 0 1 → 0 0 ∗ 0 0 → 1 1 0 ∗ 0 → 2 1 1 0 ∗ → 3  ∗ 1 1 0 → 4 1 ∗ 1 1 → 5 0 1 ∗ 1 → 6 0 0 1 ∗ → 7   13   An examination of this table reveals that all records corresponding to the query 0 * * * are mapped into locations 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7; and similarly any basic query with three *’s corresponds to exactly five locations. The basic queries    14    15   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  575  with two *’s correspond to three locations each; and the basic queries with one * correspond to either one or two locations,  8 × 1 + 24 × 2  32 = 1.75 on the average. Thus we have  Number of unspecified  bits in the query  Number of locations  4 3 2 1 0  to search 8 = 84 4 5 ≈ 83 4 3 ≈ 82 4 1.75 ≈ 81 4 1 = 80 4  Of course this is such a small example, we could handle it more easily by brute force. But it leads to nontrivial applications, since we can use it also when m = 4r and n = 3r, mapping 4r-bit records into 23r ≈ N locations by dividing the secondary keys into r groups of 4 bits each and applying  13  in each group. The resulting mapping has the desired property: A query that leaves k of the m bits unspecified will correspond to approximately N k m locations.  See exercise 6.   A. E. Brouwer [SICOMP 28  1999 , 1970–1971] has found an attractive way to compress 8 bits to 5, with a mapping analogous to  13 . Every 8-bit byte belongs to exactly one of the following 32 classes:  0∗000∗0∗ 1∗000∗0∗ 0∗010∗0∗ 1∗010∗0∗ 0∗10∗1∗0 1∗10∗1∗0 0∗11∗1∗0 1∗11∗1∗0  01∗0∗∗11 11∗0∗∗11 01∗1∗∗11 11∗1∗∗11 0∗1∗000∗ 1∗1∗000∗ 0∗0∗11∗0 1∗0∗11∗0  00∗11∗∗1 10∗11∗∗1 00∗0∗01∗ 10∗0∗01∗ ∗01∗01∗1 ∗10∗10∗0 ∗00∗011∗ ∗11∗100∗  ∗11∗∗101 ∗11∗∗010 ∗10∗0∗10 ∗10∗1∗01 ∗0∗1001∗ ∗0∗0100∗ ∗0∗011∗1 ∗0∗110∗0  The ∗’s in this design are arranged in such a way that there are 3 in each row and 12 in each column. Exercise 18 explains how to obtain similar schemes that will compress records having, say, m = 4r bits into addresses having n = 3r bits. In practice, buckets of size b would be used, and we would take N ≈ 2nb; the case b = 1 has been used in the discussion above for simplicity in exposition. Rivest has also suggested another simple way to handle basic queries. Sup- pose we have, say, N ≈ 210 records of 30 bits each, where we wish to answer arbitrary 30-bit basic queries like  10 . Then we can simply divide the 30 bits into three 10-bit fields, and keep three separate hash tables of size M = 210. Each record is stored thrice, in lists corresponding to its bit configurations in the three fields. Under suitable conditions, each list will contain about one element. Given a basic query with k unspecified bits, at least one of the fields will have ⌊k 3⌋ or fewer bits unspecified; hence we need to look in at most 2⌊k 3⌋ ≈ N k 30 of the lists to find all answers to the query. Or we could use any other technique for handling basic queries in the selected field.   576  SEARCHING  6.5  Generalized tries. Rivest went on to suggest yet another approach, based on a data structure like the tries in Section 6.3. We can let each internal node of a generalized binary trie specify which bit of the record it represents. For example, in the data of Table 1 we could let the root of the trie represent Vanilla extract; then the left subtrie would correspond to those 16 cookie recipes that omit Vanilla extract, while the right subtrie would be for the 16 that use it. This 16–16 split nicely bisects the file; and we can handle each subfile in a similar way. When a subfile becomes suitably small, we represent it by a terminal node.  To process a basic query, we start at the root of the trie. When searching a generalized trie whose root specifies an attribute where the query has 0 or 1, we search the left or right subtrie, respectively; and if the query has * in that bit position, we search both subtries.  Suppose the attributes are not binary, but they are represented in binary notation. We can build a trie by looking first at the first bit of attribute 1, then the first bit of attribute 2, . . . , the first bit of attribute m, then the second bit of attribute 1, etc. Such a structure is called an “m-d trie,” by analogy with m-d trees  which branch by comparisons instead of by bit inspections . P. Flajolet and C. Puech have shown that the average time to answer a partial match query in a random m-d trie of N nodes is Θ N k m  when k m of the attributes are unspecified [JACM 33  1986 , 371–407, §4.1]; the variance has been calculated by W. Schachinger, Random Structures & Algorithms 7  1995 , 81–95.  Similar algorithms can be developed for m-dimensional versions of the digital search trees and Patricia trees of Section 6.3. These structures, which tend to be slightly better balanced than m-d tries, have been analyzed by P. Kirschenhofer and H. Prodinger, Random Structures & Algorithms 5  1994 , 123–134. *Balanced filing schemes. Another combinatorial approach to information retrieval, based on balanced incomplete block designs, has been the subject of considerable investigation. Although the subject is quite interesting from a mathematical point of view, it has unfortunately not yet proved to be more useful than the other methods described above. A brief introduction to the theory will be presented here in order to indicate the flavor of the results, in hopes that readers might think of good ways to put the ideas to practical use. A Steiner triple system is an arrangement of v objects into unordered triples in such a way that every pair of objects occurs in exactly one triple. For example, when v = 7 there is essentially only one Steiner triple system, namely  Triple {1, 2, 4} {2, 3, 5} {3, 4, 6} {4, 5, 0} {5, 6, 1} {6, 0, 2} {0, 1, 3}  Pairs included  {1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 4} {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 5} {3, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 6} {0, 4}, {0, 5}, {4, 5} {1, 5}, {1, 6}, {5, 6} {0, 2}, {0, 6}, {2, 6} {0, 1}, {0, 3}, {1, 3}   16    6.5  6 v v−1  and 1  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  577 2 v v − 1  pairs of objects and three pairs per triple, there must Since there are 1 6 v v−1  triples in all; and since each object must be paired with v−1 others, be 1 2 v−1  triples. These conditions imply that each object must appear in exactly 1 2 v−1  are integers, and a Steiner triple system can’t exist unless 1 this is equivalent to saying that v is odd and not congruent to 2 modulo 3; thus  17  Conversely, T. P. Kirkman proved in 1847 that Steiner triple systems do exist for all v ≥ 1 such that  17  holds. His interesting construction is given in exercise 10. Steiner triple systems can be used to reduce the redundancy of combined inverted file indexes. For example, consider again the cookie recipe file of Table 1, and convert the rightmost column into a 31st attribute that is 1 if any special ingredients are necessary, 0 otherwise. Assume that we want to answer all inclusive queries on pairs of attributes, such as “What recipes use both coconut  and raisins?” We could make up an inverted list for each of the 31 Pfeffernuesse  for example  would appear in17   = 465  = 136 of the lists, and a record  possible queries. But it would turn out that this takes a lot of space since  v mod 6 = 1 or 3.  with all 31 attributes would appear in every list! A Steiner triple system can be used to make a slight improvement in this situation. There is a Steiner triple system on 31 objects, with 155 triples and each pair of objects occurring in exactly one of the triples. We can associate four lists with each triple {a, b, c}, one list for all records having attributes a, b, ¯c  that is, a and b but not c ; another for a, ¯b, c; another for ¯a, b, c; and another for records having all three attributes a, b, c. This guarantees that no record will be included in more than 155 of the inverted lists, and it saves space whenever a record has three attributes that correspond to a triple of the system.  Triple systems are special cases of block designs that have blocks of three or more objects. For example, there is a way to arrange 31 objects into sextuples so that every pair of objects appears in exactly one sextuple:  2  2  {0, 4, 16, 21, 22, 24}, {1, 5, 17, 22, 23, 25}, . . . , {30, 3, 15, 20, 21, 23}   18   This design is formed from the first block by addition mod 31. To verify that it has the stated property, note that the 30 values  ai − aj  mod 31, for i ̸= j, are distinct, where  a1, a2, . . . , a6  =  0, 4, 16, 21, 22, 24 . To find the sextuple containing a pair  x, y , choose i and j such that ai − aj ≡ x − y  modulo 31 ; now if k =  x−ai  mod 31, we have  ai+k  mod 31 = x and  aj+k  mod 31 = y.  We can use the design above to store the inverted lists in such a way that no record can appear more than 31 times. Each sextuple {a, b, c, d, e, f} is associated with 57 lists, for the various possibilities of records having two or more of the attributes a, b, c, d, e, f, namely  a, b,¯c, ¯d, ¯e, ¯f ,  a,¯b, c, ¯d, ¯e, ¯f , . . . ,  a, b, c, d, e, f ; and the answer to each inclusive 2-attribute query is the disjoint union of 16 appropriate lists in the appropriate sextuple. For this design, Pfeffernuesse would be stored in 29 of the 31 blocks, since that record has two of the six attributes in all but blocks {19, 23, 4, 9, 10, 12} and {13, 17, 29, 3, 4, 6} if we number the columns from 0 to 30.   578  SEARCHING  6.5  The theory of block designs and related patterns is developed in detail in Marshall Hall, Jr.’s book Combinatorial Theory  Waltham, Mass.: Blaisdell, 1967 . Although such combinatorial configurations are very beautiful, their main application to information retrieval so far has been to decrease the redundancy incurred when compound inverted lists are being used; and David K. Chow [Information and Control 15  1969 , 377–396] has observed that this type of decrease can be obtained even without using combinatorial designs. A short history and bibliography. The first published article dealing with a technique for secondary key retrieval was by L. R. Johnson in CACM 4  1961 , 218–222. The multilist system was developed independently by Noah S. Prywes, H. J. Gray, W. I. Landauer, D. Lefkowitz, and S. Litwin at about the same time; see IEEE Trans. on Communication and Electronics 82  1963 , 488–492. Another rather early publication that influenced later work was by D. R. Davis and A. D. Lin, CACM 8  1965 , 243–246.  Since then a large literature on the subject grew up rapidly, but much of it dealt with the user interface and with programming language considerations, which are not within the scope of this book. In addition to the papers already cited, the following published articles were found to be most helpful to the author as this section was first being written in 1972: Jack Minker and Jerome Sable, Ann. Rev. of Information Science and Technology 2  1967 , 123–160; Robert E. Bleier, Proc. ACM Nat. Conf. 22  1967 , 41–49; Jerome A. Feldman and Paul D. Rovner, CACM 12  1969 , 439–449; Burton H. Bloom, Proc. ACM Nat. Conf. 24  1969 , 83–95; H. S. Heaps and L. H. Thiel, Information Storage and Retrieval 6  1970 , 137–153; Vincent Y. Lum and Huei Ling, Proc. ACM Nat. Conf. 26  1971 , 349–356. A good survey of manual card-filing systems appears in Methods of Information Handling by C. P. Bourne  New York: Wiley, 1963 , Chapter 5. Balanced filing schemes were originally developed by C. T. Abraham, S. P. Ghosh, and D. K. Ray-Chaudhuri in 1965; see the article by R. C. Bose and Gary G. Koch, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 17  1969 , 1203–1214.  are planned for the next edition of this book, including the following:  Most of the classical algorithms for multi-attribute data that are known to be of practical importance have been discussed above; but a few more topics   E. M. McCreight introduced priority search trees [SICOMP 14  1985 , 257– 276], which are specially designed to represent intersections of dynamically changing families of intervals, and to handle range queries of the form “Find all records with x0 ≤ x ≤ x1 and y ≤ y1.”  Notice that the lower bound on y must be −∞, but x can be bounded on both sides.    M. L. Fredman has proved several fundamental lower bounds, which show that a sequence of N intermixed insertions, deletions, and k-dimensional  range queries must take ΩN log N k operations in the worst case, re-  gardless of the data structure being used. See JACM 28  1981 , 696–705; SICOMP 10  1981 , 1–10; J. Algorithms 2  1981 , 77–87.  Basic algorithms for pattern matching and approximate pattern matching in text strings will be discussed in Chapter 9.   6.5  RETRIEVAL ON SECONDARY KEYS  579  It is interesting to note that the human brain is much better at secondary key retrieval than computers are; in fact, people find it rather easy to recognize faces or melodies from only fragmentary information, while computers have barely been able to do this at all. Therefore it is not unlikely that a completely new approach to machine design will someday be discovered that solves the problem of secondary key retrieval once and for all, making this entire section obsolete.  EXERCISES   cid:120  1. [M27] Let 0 ≤ k ≤ n 2. Prove that the following construction produces n   such paths. j ≥ 1, so that the path never goes below the x axis. There are exactlyn  permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} such that every t-element subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} appears as the first t elements of at least one of the permutations, for t ≤ k or t ≥ n − k: Consider a path in the plane from  0, 0  to  n, r  where r ≥ n − 2k, in which the ith step is from  i−1, j  to  i, j+1  or to  i, j−1 ; the latter possibility is allowed only if  For each path of this kind, a permutation is constructed as follows, using three lists that are initially empty: For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, if the ith step of the path goes up, put the number i into list B; if the step goes down, put i into list A and move the currently largest element of list B into list C. The resulting permutation is equal to the final contents of list A, then list B, then list C, each list in increasing order.

These six permutations correspond to the compound attributes in  8 .  Hint: Represent each t-element subset S by a path that goes from  0, 0  to  n, n−2t , whose ith step runs from  i−1, j  to  i, j+1  if i  ∈ S and to  i, j−1  if i ∈ S. Convert every such path into an appropriate path having the special form stated above. 2. [M25]  Sakti P. Ghosh.

[M20] Prove that when v = 3n, the set of all triples of the form { a1 . . . ak−1 0 b1 . . . bn−k 3,  a1 . . . ak−1 1 c1 . . . cn−k 3,  a1 . . . ak−1 2 d1 . . . dn−k 3}, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, forms a Steiner triple system, where the a’s, b’s, c’s, and d’s range over all combinations of 0s, 1s, and 2s such that bj + cj + dj ≡ 0  modulo 3  for 1 ≤ j ≤ n − k. 10. [M32]  Thomas P. Kirkman, Cambridge and Dublin Math. Journal 2  1847 , 191–204.  Let us say that a Kirkman triple system of order v is an arrangement of v + 1 objects {x0, x1, . . . , xv} into triples such that every pair {xi, xj} for i ̸= j occurs in exactly one triple, except that the v pairs {xi, x i+1  mod v} do not ever occur in the same triple, for 0 ≤ i < v.

The triples of K′ are those of S′ minus all those containing y1 and or yv−1. d  Use the preceding results to prove that Kirkman triple systems of order v exist for all v ≥ 0 of the form 6k or 6k + 4, and Steiner triple systems on v objects exist for all v ≥ 1 of the form 6k + 1 or 6k + 3.  11. [M25] The text describes the use of Steiner triple systems in connection with inclusive queries; in order to extend this to all basic queries it is natural to define the following concept. A complemented triple system of order v is an arrangement of 2v objects {x1, . . . , xv, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xv} into triples such that every pair of objects occurs together in exactly one triple, except that complementary pairs {xi, ¯xi} never occur together. For example,  {x1, x2, x3}, {x1, ¯x2, ¯x3}, {¯x1, x2, ¯x3}, {¯x1, ¯x2, x3}  is a complemented triple system of order three.  Prove that complemented triple systems of order v exist for all v ≥ 0 not of the  form 3k + 2. 12. [M23] Continuing exercise 11, construct a complemented quadruple system of order 7. 13.

[M35]  Associative block designs.  A set of m-tuples like  13 , with exactly m− n  ∗’s in each of 2n rows, is called an ABD m, n  if every column contains the same number of ∗’s and if every pair of rows has a “mismatch”  0 versus 1  in some column.

Persistent structures are able to represent changing information in such a way that the past history can be reconstructed efficiently. In other words, we might do many insertions and deletions, but we can still conduct searches as if the updates after a given time had not been made.

There need be no real danger of it ever becoming a drudge, for any processes that are quite mechanical may be turned over to the machine itself. — ALAN M.

Let p 1  . . . p N  and q 1  . . . q N  be different permutations satisfying the condi- tions, and let i be minimal with p i  ̸= q i . Then p i  = q j  for some j > i, and q i  = p k  for some k > i. Since Kp i  ≤ Kp k  = Kq i  ≤ Kq j  = Kp i  we have Kp i  = Kq i ; hence by stability p i  < p k  = q i  < q j  = p i , a contradiction. 2. Yes, if the sorting operations were all stable.  If they were not stable we cannot say.  Alice and Chris certainly have the same result; and so does Bill, since the stability shows that equal major keys in his result are accompanied by minor keys in nondecreasing order.  Formally, assume that Bill obtains Rp 1  . . . Rp N  = R′1 . . . R′N after sorting the minor keys, then R′q 1  . . . R′q N  = Rp q 1   . . . Rp q N   after sorting the major keys; we want to show that   Kp q i  , kp q i    ≤  Kp q i+1  , kp q i+1     for 1 ≤ i < N. If Kp q i   ̸= Kp q i+1  , we have Kp q i   < Kp q i+1  ; and if Kp q i   = Kp q i+1  , then K′q i  = K′q i+1 , hence q i  < q i + 1 , hence k′q i  ≤ k′q i+1 ; that is, kp q i   ≤ kp q i+1  . 3. We can always bring all records with equal keys together, preserving their relative order, treating these groups of records as a unit in further operations; hence we may assume that all keys are distinct. Let a < b < c < a; then we can arrange things so that the first three keys are abc, bca, or cab. Now if N − 1 distinct keys can be sorted in three ways, so can N; for if K1   KN we always have either Ki−1 < KN < Ki for some i, or KN < K1. 584   5  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  585  4. First compare words without case distinction, then use case to break ties. More precisely, replace each word α by the pair  α′, α  where α′ is obtained from α by mapping A → a, . . . , Z → z; then sort the pairs lexicographically. This procedure gives, for example, tex < Tex < TeX < TEX < text.  Dictionaries must also deal with accented letters, prefixes, suffixes, and abbrevia-  tions; for example,  a < A < Å < a- < a. < -a < A- < A. < aa < a.a.  < ¯aa < ¯a¯a < AA < A.A. < AAA < ··· < zz < Zz. < ZZ < zzz < ZZZ.  In this more general situation we obtain α′ by mapping ¯a → a, Å → a, etc., and dropping the hyphens and periods. 5. Let ρ 0  = 0 and ρ  1α 2  = 1ρ α α; here  1α 2 is the ordinary binary represen- tation of a positive integer, and α is the length of the string α. We have ρ 1  = 10, ρ 2  = 1100, ρ 3  = 1101, ρ 4  = 1110000, . . . , ρ 1009  = 111101001111110001, . . . , ρ 65536  = 15024, . . . , ρ 265536  = 16065560, etc. The length of ρ n  is ρ n  = λ n  + λ λ n   + λ λ λ n    + ··· + lg∗ n + 1,  where λ 0  = 0, λ n  = ⌊lg n⌋ for n ≥ 1, and lg∗ n is the least integer m ≥ 0 such that λ[m] n  = 0.

Some sorting methods make it convenient to drop records whose keys appear more than once as the sorting progresses.  11. Assign each person an identification number, which must appear on all forms concerning that individual. Sort the information forms and the tax forms separately, with this identification number as the key. Denote the sorted tax forms by R1, . . . , RN, with keys K1 < ··· < KN.  There should be no two tax forms with equal keys.  Add a new  N + 1 st record whose key is ∞, and set i ← 1. Then, for each record in the  r   5  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  587  information file, check if it has been reported, as follows: Let K denote the key on the information form being processed. a  If K > Ki, increase i by 1 and repeat this step. b  If K < Ki, or if K = Ki and the information is not reflected on tax form Ri,  signal an error.  Try to do all this processing without wasting the taxpayers’ money. 12. One way is to attach the key  j, i  to the entry ai,j and to sort using lexicographic order, then omit the keys.  A similar idea can be used to obtain any desired reordering of information, when a simple formula for the reordering can be given.   In the special case considered in this problem, the method of “balanced two-way merge sorting” treats the keys in such a simple manner that it is unnecessary to write any keys explicitly on the tapes. Given an n × n matrix, we may proceed as follows: First put odd-numbered rows on tape 1, even-numbered rows on tape 2, etc., obtaining  Tape 1: a11 a12 . . . a1n a31 a32 . . . a3n a51 a52 . . . a5n . . .

One way is to attach random distinct key values, sort on those keys, then discard the keys.  See exercise 12; a similar method for obtaining a random sample was discussed in Section 3.4.2.  Another technique, involving about the same amount of work but apparently not straining the accuracy of the random number generator as much, is to attach a random integer in the range 0 ≤ Ki ≤ N − i to Ri, then rearrange using the technique of exercise 5.1.1–5. 14. With a character-conversion table, you can design a lexicographic comparison rou- tine that simulates the order used on the other machine. Alternatively, you could create artificial keys, different from the actual characters but giving the desired ordering. The latter method has the advantage that it needs to be done only once; but it takes more space and requires conversion of the entire key. The former method can often determine the result of a comparison by converting only one or two letters of the keys; during later stages of sorting, the comparison will be between nearly equal keys, however, and the former method may find it advantageous to check for equality of letters before converting them. 15. For this problem, just run through the file once keeping 50 or so individual counts. But if “city” were substituted for “state,” and if the total number of cities were quite large, it would be a good idea to sort on the city name. 16. As in exercise 15, it depends on the size of the problem. If the total number of cross-reference entries fits into high-speed memory, the best approach is probably to use a symbol table algorithm  Chapter 6  with each identifier associated with the head of a linked list of references. For larger problems, create a file of records, one record for each cross-reference citation to be put in the index, and sort it.   588  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5  17. Carry along with each card a “shadow key” that, sorted lexicographically in the usual simple way, will define the desired ordering. This key is to be supplied by library personnel and attached to the catalog data when it first enters the system, although it is not visible to normal users. A possible key uses the following two-letter codes to separate words from each other:  The given example would come out as follows  showing only the first 25 characters :  ␣0 ␣1 ␣2 ␣3 ␣4 ␣5 ␣6 ␣7 ␣8  end of key; end of cross-reference card; end of surname; hyphen of multiple surname; end of author name; end of place name; end of subject heading; end of book title; space between words.

Notice that “Saint-Saëns” is a hyphenated name but not a compound name. The birth year of al-Khuw¯arizm¯ı should be given as, say, ␣40779 with a leading zero.  This scheme will work until the year 9999, after which the world will face a huge software crisis.   Careful study of this example reveals how to deal with many other unusual types  of order that are needed in human-computer interaction.   5  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  589  18. For example, we can make two files containing values of  u6 + v6 + w6  mod m and  z6 − x6 − y6  mod m for u ≤ v ≤ w, x ≤ y ≤ z, where m is the word size of our computer. Sort these and look for duplicates, then subject the duplicates to further tests.  Some congruences modulo small primes might also be used to place further restrictions on u, v, w, x, y, z.  19. In general, to find all pairs of numbers {xi, xj} with xi + xj = c, where c is given: Sort the file so that x1 < x2 < ··· < xN. Set i ← 1, j ← N, and then repeat the following operation until j ≤ i:  If xi + xj = c, output {xi, xj}, set i ← i + 1, j ← j − 1; If xi + xj < c, set i ← i + 1; If xi + xj > c, set j ← j − 1.  Finally if j = i and 2xi = c, output {xi, xi}. This process is like the method of exercise 18: We are essentially making two sorted files, one containing x1, . . . , xN and the other containing c−xN , . . . , c−x1, and checking for duplicates. But the second file doesn’t need to be explicitly formed in this case. Another approach, suggested by Jiang Ling, is to sort on a key such as  x > c 2 ⇒ x, x ≤ c 2 ⇒ c − x . A similar algorithm can be used to find max{xi + xj  xi + xj ≤ c}; or to find, say, min{xi + yj  xi + yj > t} given t and two sorted files x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xm, y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn. 20. Some of the alternatives are:  a  For each of the 499,500 pairs i, j, with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 1000, set y1 ← xi ⊕ xj, y2 ← y1 &  y1 − 1 , y3 ← y2 &  y2 − 1 ; then print  xi, xj  if and only if y3 = 0. Here ⊕ denotes “exclusive or” and & denotes “bitwise and”.  b  Create a file with 31,000 entries, forming 31 entries from each original word xi by including xi and the 30 words that differ from xi in one position. Sort this file and look for duplicates.  c  Do a test analogous to  a  on i  all pairs of words that agree in their first 10 bits; ii  all pairs of words that agree in their middle 10 bits, but not the first 10; iii  all pairs of words that agree in their last 10 bits, but neither the first nor middle 10. This involves three sorts of the data, using a specified 10-bit key each time. The expected number of pairs in each of the three cases is at most 499500 210, which is less than 500, if the original words are randomly distributed. 21. First prepare a file containing all five-letter English words.  Be sure to consider adding suffixes such as -ED, -ER, -ERS, -S to shorter words.  Now take each five- letter word α and sort its letters into ascending order, obtaining the sorted five-letter sequence α′. Finally sort all pairs  α′, α  to bring all anagrams together.  Experiments by Kim D. Gibson in 1967 showed that the second longest set of commonly known five-letter anagrams is LEAST, SLATE, STALE, STEAL, TAELS, TALES, TEALS. But if he had been able to use larger dictionaries, he would have been able to catapult this set into first place, by adding the words ALETS  steel shoulderplates , ASTEL  a splinter , ATLES  intends , LAETS  people who rank between slaves and freemen , LASET  an ermine , LATES  a Nile perch , LEATS  watercourses , SALET  a mediæval helmet , SETAL  pertaining to setae , SLEAT  to incite , STELA  a column , and TESLA  a unit of magnetic flux density . Together with the old spellings SATEL, TASEL, and TASLE for “settle” and “teasel,” we obtain 22 mutually permutable words, none of which needs to be spelled with an uppercase letter. And with a bit more daring we might add the Old English tæsl, German altes, and Madame de Staël! The set {LAPSE, LEAPS, PALES, PEALS, PLEAS, SALEP, SEPAL} can also be extended to at least 14 words when we turn to unabridged dictionaries. [See H. E. Dudeney, Strand 65  1923 , 208, 312, and   590  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5  his 300 Best Word Puzzles, edited by Martin Gardner  1968 , Puzzles 190 and 194; Ross Eckler, Making the Alphabet Dance  St. Martin’s Griffin, 1997 , Fig. 46c.] The first and last sets of three or more five-letter English anagrams are {ALBAS, BALAS, BALSA, BASAL} and {STRUT, STURT, TRUST}, if proper names are not allowed. How- ever, the proper names Alban, Balan, Laban, and Nabal lead to an earlier set {ALBAN, BALAN, BANAL, LABAN, NABAL, NABLA} if that restriction is dropped. The most striking example of longer anagram words in common English is perhaps the amazingly math- ematical set {ALERTING, ALTERING, INTEGRAL, RELATING, TRIANGLE}. A faster way to proceed is to compute f α  =  h a1 + h a2 +···+ h a5   mod m, where a1, . . . , a5 are numerical codes for the individual letters in α, and  h 1 , h 2 , . . .   are 26 randomly selected constants; here m is, say, 2⌊2 lg N⌋ when there are N words. Sorting the file  f α , α  with two passes of Algorithm 5.2.5R will bring anagrams together; afterwards when f α  = f β  we must make sure that we have a true anagram with α′ = β′. The value f α  can be calculated more rapidly than α′, and this method avoids the determination of α′ for most of the words α in the file.  Note: A similar technique can be used when we want to bring together all sets of records that have equal multiword keys  a1, . . . , an . Suppose that we don’t care about the order of the file, except that records with equal keys are to be brought together; it is sometimes faster to sort on the one-word key  a1xn−1 + a2xn−2 + ··· + an  mod m, where x is any fixed value, instead of sorting on the original multiword key. 22. Find isomorphic invariants of the graphs  functions that take equal values on isomorphic directed graphs  and sort on these invariants, to separate “obviously noni- somorphic” graphs from each other. Examples of isomorphic invariants:  a  Represent vertex vi by  ai, bi , where ai is its in-degree and bi is its out-degree; then sort the pairs  ai, bi  into lexicographic order. The resulting file is an isomorphic invariant.  b  Represent an arc from vi to vj by  ai, bi, aj, bj , and sort these quadruples into lexicographic order.  c  Separate the directed graph into connected components  see Algorithm 2.3.3E , determine invariants of each component, and sort the components into order of their invariants in some way. See also the discussion in exercise 21.  After sorting the directed graphs on their invariants, it will still be necessary to make secondary tests to see whether directed graphs with identical invariants are in fact isomorphic. The invariants are helpful for these tests too. In the case of free trees it is possible to find “characteristic” or “canonical” invariants that completely characterize the tree, so that secondary testing is unnecessary [see J. Hopcroft and R. E. Tarjan, in Complexity of Computer Computations  New York: Plenum, 1972 , 140–142]. 23. One way is to form a file containing all three-person cliques, then transform it into  cliques of size k; so this method can blow up even when n is only 25 or so.  leastn a file containing all four-person cliques, etc.; if there are no large cliques, this method will be quite satisfactory.  On the other hand, if there is a clique of size n, there are at Given a file that lists all  k − 1 -person cliques, in the form  a1, . . . , ak−1  where a1 < ··· < ak−1, we can find the k-person cliques by  i  creating a new file containing the entries  b, c, a1, . . . , ak−2  for each pair of  k − 1 -person cliques of the respective forms  a1, . . . , ak−2, b ,  a1, . . . , ak−2, c  with b < c;  ii  sorting this file on its first two components;  iii  for each entry  b, c, a1, . . . , ak−2  in this new file that matches a pair  b, c  of acquaintances in the originally given file, output the k-person clique  a1, . . . , ak−2, b, c . 24.  Solution by Norman Hardy, c. 1967.  Make another copy of the input file; sort one copy on the first components and the other on the second. Passing over these  k   5.1.1  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  591  files in sequence now allows us to create a new file containing all pairs  xi, xi+2  for 1 ≤ i ≤ N −2, and to identify  xN−1, xN . The pairs  N−1, xN−1  and  N, xN  should be written on still another file. The process continues inductively. Assume that file F contains all pairs  xi, xi+t  for 1 ≤ i ≤ N − t, in random order, and that file G contains all pairs  i, xi  for N − t < i ≤ N in order of the second components. Let H be a copy of file F, and sort H by first components, F by second. Now go through F, G, and H, creating two new files F ′ and G′, as follows. If the current records of files F, G, H are, respectively  x, x′ ,  y, y′ ,  z, z′ , then:  i  If x′ = z, output  x, z′  to F ′ and advance files F and H. ii  If x′ = y′, output  y−t, x  to G′ and advance files F and G. iii  If x′ > y′, advance file G. iv  If x′ > z, advance file H. When file F is exhausted, sort G′ by second components and merge G with it; then replace t by 2t, F by F ′, G by G′. Thus t takes the values 2, 4, 8, . . . ; and for fixed t we do O log N  passes over the data to sort it. Hence the total number of passes is O  log N 2 . Eventually t ≥ N, so F is empty; then we simply sort G on its first components. 25.  An idea due to D. Shanks.  Prepare two files, one containing amn mod p and the other containing ba−n mod p for 0 ≤ n < m. Sort these files and find a common entry. p log p . Signifi- cant further improvements are often possible; for example, we can easily determine if n is even or odd, in log p steps, by testing whether b p−1  2 mod p = 1 or  p−1 . In general if f is any divisor of p − 1 and d is any divisor of gcd f, n , we can similarly determine  n d  mod f by looking up the value of b p−1  f in a table of length f  d. If p − 1 has the prime factors q1 ≤ q2 ≤ ··· ≤ qt and if qt is small, we can therefore compute n rapidly by finding the digits from right to left in its mixed-radix representation, for radices q1, . . . , qt.  This idea is due to R. L. Silver, 1964; see also S. C. Pohlig and M. Hellman, IEEE Transactions IT-24  1978 , 106–110.  John M. Pollard discovered an elegant way to compute discrete logs with about O √ p   operations mod p, requiring very little memory, based on the theory of random mappings. See Math. Comp. 32  1978 , 918–924, where he also suggests another method based on numbers nj = r j mod p that have only small prime factors.  Note: This reduces the worst-case running time from Θ p  to Θ √  Asymptotically faster methods are discussed in exercise 4.5.4–46.

Let α be a string [m1, n1] . . . [mk, nk] of ordered pairs of nonnegative integers; we write α = k, the length of α. Let ϵ denote the empty  length 0  string. Consider the binary operation ◦ defined recursively on pairs of such strings as follows:  ϵ ◦ α = α ◦ ϵ = α;   [m, n] α  ◦  [m′, n′] β  =   [m, n] α ◦  [m′−m, n′] β  ,  [m′, n′]  [m−m′−1, n] α  ◦ β ,  if m ≤ m′, if m > m′.  It follows that the computation time required to evaluate α ◦ β is proportional to α ◦ β = α + β. Furthermore, we can prove that ◦ is associative and that [b1, 1] ◦ [b2, 2]◦···◦ [bn, n] = [0, a1][0, a2] . . . [0, an]. The expression on the left can be evaluated in ⌈lg n⌉ passes, each pass combining pairs of strings, for a total of O n log n  steps. Example: Starting from  2 , we want to evaluate [2, 1] ◦ [3, 2] ◦ [6, 3] ◦ [4, 4] ◦ [0, 5] ◦ [2, 6]◦[2, 7]◦[1, 8]◦[0, 9]. The first pass reduces this to [2, 1][1, 2]◦[4, 4][1, 3]◦[0, 5][2, 6]◦ [1, 8][0, 7]◦[0, 9]. The second pass reduces it to [2, 1][1, 2][1, 4][1, 3]◦[0, 5][1, 8][0, 6][0, 7]◦ [0, 9]. The third pass yields [0, 5][1, 1][0, 8][0, 2][0, 6][0, 4][0, 7][0, 3] ◦ [0, 9]. The fourth pass yields  1 . Motivation: A string such as [4, 4][1, 3] stands for “␣␣␣␣4␣3␣∞”, where “␣” denotes a blank; the operation α◦ β inserts the blanks and nonblanks of β into the blanks of α. Note that, together with exercise 2, we obtain an algorithm for the Josephus problem that is O n log n  instead of O mn , partially answering a question raised in exercise 1.3.2–22.  Another O n log n  solution to this problem, using a random-access memory, fol-  lows from the use of balanced trees in a straightforward manner. 6. Start with b1 = b2 = ··· = bn = 0. For k = ⌊lg n⌋, ⌊lg n⌋−1, . . . , 0 do the following: Set xs ← 0 for 0 ≤ s ≤ n 2k+1; then for j = 1, 2, . . . , n do the following: Set r ← ⌊aj 2k⌋ mod 2, s ← ⌊aj 2k+1⌋  these are essentially bit extractions ; if r = 0, set baj ← baj + xs, and if r = 1 set xs ← xs + 1.  Another solution appears in exercise 5.2.4–21.  7. Bj < j and Cj ≤ n− j, since aj has j −1 elements to its left and n− j elements to its right. To reconstruct a1 a2 . . . an from B1 B2 . . . Bn, start with the element 1; then for k = 2, . . . , n add one to each element ≥ k − Bk and append k − Bk at the right.  See Method 2 in Section 1.2.5 . A similar procedure works for the C’s. Alternatively, we could use the result of the following exercise. [The c inversion table was discussed by Rodrigues, J. de Math. 4  1839 , 236–240. The C inversion table was used by Rothe in 1800; see also Netto’s Lehrbuch der Combinatorik  1901 , §5.] 8. b′ = C, c′ = B, B′ = c, C′ = b, since each inversion  ai, aj  of a1 . . . an corresponds to the inversion  j, i  of a′1 . . . a′n.

Equivalently  see answer 8 f   we may represent π = a1 a2 a3 a4 by cent vertices is the vector  a′1, a′2, a′3, a′4 , where a′1 a′2 a′3 a′4 is the inverse permutation.  This 4-D repre- sentation of the truncated octahedron with permutations as coordinates was discussed together with its n-dimensional generalization by C. Howard Hinton in The Fourth Dimension  London, 1904 , Chapter 10. Further properties were found many years later by Guilbaud and Rosenstiehl, who called Fig. 1 the “permutahedron”; see exercise 12.  Replicas of the truncated octahedron will fill three-dimensional space in what has been called the simplest possible way [see H. Steinhaus, Mathematical Snapshots  Ox- ford, 1960 , 200–203; C. S. Smith, Scientific American 190, 1  January 1954 , 58–64]. Book V of Pappus’s Collection  c. A.D. 300  mentions the truncated octahedron as one of 13 special solid figures studied by Archimedes. Illustrations of the Archimedean solids — the nonprism polyhedra that have symmetries taking any vertex into any other, and whose faces are regular polygons but not all identical — can be found, for example, in books by W. W. Rouse Ball, Mathematical Recreations and Essays, revised by H. S. M. Coxeter  Macmillan, 1939 , Chapter 5; H. Martyn Cundy and A. P.

If there are no oriented cycles, this directed graph can be topologically sorted, and the resulting linear order is the desired permutation. If there is an oriented cycle, the shortest has length 3, since there are none of length 1 or 2 and since a longer cycle a1 → a2 → a3 → a4 → ··· → a1 can be shortened  either a1 → a3 or a3 → a1 . But an oriented cycle of length 3 contains two arcs of either E or E, and proves that E or E is not transitive after all. 12. [G. T. Guilbaud and P. Rosenstiehl, Math. et Sciences Humaines 4  1963 , 9–33.] Suppose that  a, b  ∈ E,  b, c  ∈ E,  a, c   ∈ E. Then for some k ≥ 1 we have a = x0 > x1 > ··· > xk = c, where  xi, xi+1  ∈ E π1  ∪ E π2  for 0 ≤ i < k. Consider a counterexample of this type where k is minimal. Since  a, b   ∈ E π1  and  b, c   ∈ E π1 , we have  a, c   ∈ E π1 , and similarly  a, c   ∈ E π2 ; hence k > 1. But if x1 > b, then  x1, b  ∈ E contradicts the minimality of k, while  x1, b  ∈ E implies that  a, b  ∈ E. Similarly, if x1 < b, both  b, x1  ∈ E and  b, x1  ∈ E are impossible. 13. For any fixed choice of b1, . . . , bn−m, bn−m+2, . . . , bn in the inversion table, the j bj will assume each possible residue modulo m exactly once as bn−m+1 runs through its possible values 0, 1, . . . , m − 1. 14.

The coefficient of znqm in the first identity is the number of partitions of m into at most n parts.

But if a1 > an, h α  has n−1 fewer inversions, because xj loses its inversion of an and of each element in αj. Therefore if we set xn = an and recursively let x1 . . . xn−1 = f h α  , the permutation f α  = x1 . . . xn has the desired properties. We have f 1 9 8 2 6 3 7 4 5  = 9 1 2 6 3 8 7 4 5, and f [−1] 1 9 8 2 6 3 7 4 5  = 1 9 2 6 8 7 3 4 5.   b  The key point is that inv α  = inv α−  and ind α−  = ind f α − , when α− is the inverse of α. Therefore if α1 = α−, α2 = f α1 , α3 = α−2 , α4 = f [−1] α3 , and α5 = α−4 , we have  inv α5  = inv α4  = ind α3  = ind α−2   = ind α−1   = ind α ; ind α5  = ind α−4   = ind α−3   = ind α2  = inv α1  = inv α .

Interchanging two adjacent elements changes the total displacement by 0 or ±2; hence td a1 a2 . . . an  ≤ 2 inv a1 a2 . . . an . We can also prove that td a1 a2 . . . an  ≥ inv a1 a2 . . . an . Suppose j is the smallest element out of place, and let ak = j. Let l be maximum with l < k and al ≥ k. Interchanging al with ak reduces the inversions by 2 k− l −1, and reduces the total displacement by 2 k−l . Therefore if m repetitions of this algorithm are needed to sort a given permutation a1 a2 . . . an, we have td a1 a2 . . . an  = inv a1 a2 . . . an  + m. The average total displacement of a random permutation is  n2−1  3; see exercise 5.2.1–7. The generating function for total displacement does not appear to have a simple form. References: C.

We can obtain π as a product of inv π  transpositions τj, where τj interchanges j and j + 1. For example, the path 1234 → 1324 → 1342 → 3142 in Fig. 1 corresponds to τ2, then τ3, then τ1; hence 3 1 4 2 = τ1τ3τ2. Therefore ππ′ is obtainable from π′ by making inv π  transpositions, each of which changes the number of inversions by ±1. It follows that inv ππ′  ≤ inv π  + inv π′ . If equality holds, each transposition adds a new inversion, hence E ππ′  ⊇ E π′ . Conversely, if E ππ′  ⊇ E π′ , we want to show that some sequence of E ππ′  − E π′  = inv ππ′ −inv π′  transpositions will transform π′ to ππ′. Such transpositions define π, so this will prove that inv π  ≤ inv ππ′  − inv π′ ; hence equality must hold. Suppose, for example, that π′ = 3 1 4 5 9 2 6 8 7 and that E ππ′  ⊇ E π′ . If E ππ′  does not contain  4, 1  or  5, 4  or  9, 5  or  6, 2  or  8, 6 , then ππ′ must be equal to π′. Otherwise E ππ′  contains one of them, say  9, 5 ; then E ππ′  contains E τ4π′  = E 3 1 4 9 5 2 6 8 7 . In this way we can prove the result by induction on E ππ′  − E π′ .  SECTION 5.1.2 1.

The complete factorization into primes is  d   b c d   b   a d b c   a b   b c d   d , which is unique since no adjacent pairs commute. So there are eight solutions, with α = ϵ,  d ,  d  10. False, but true in interesting cases. Given any linear ordering of the primes, there is at least one factorization of the stated form, since whenever the condition is violated we can make an interchange that reduces the number of “inversions” in the factorization. So the condition fails only because some permutations have more than one such factorization. Let ρ ∼ σ mean that ρ commutes with σ. The following condition is necessary  and sufficient for the uniqueness of the factorization as stated:  ρ ∼ σ ∼ τ  and  ρ ≺ σ ≺ τ  implies  ρ ∼ τ.  If ρ ∼ σ ∼ τ and ρ ≺ σ ≺ τ and ρ ̸∼ τ, we would have two factorizations Proof. σ τ ρ = τ ρ σ; hence the condition is necessary. Conversely, to show that it is sufficient for uniqueness, let ρ1 ··· ρn = σ1 ··· σn be two distinct factorizations satisfying the condition. We may assume that σ1 ≺ ρ1, and hence σ1 = ρk for some smallest k > 1; furthermore σ1 ∼ ρj for 1 ≤ j < k. Since ρk−1 ∼ σ1 = ρk, we have ρk−1 ≺ σ1; hence k > 2. Let j be such that σ1 ≺ ρj and ρi ≺ σ1 for j < i < k. Then ρj+1 ∼ σ1 ∼ ρj and ρj+1 ≺ σ1 ≺ ρj implies that ρj+1 ∼ ρj; hence ρj ≺ ρj+1, a contradiction.  Therefore if we are given an ordering relation on a set S of primes, satisfying the condition above, and if we know that all prime factors of a permutation π belongs to S, we can conclude that π has a unique factorization of the stated type. Such a condition holds, for example, when S is the set of cycles in  29 . But the set of all primes cannot be so ordered. For if we have, say,  a b  ≺  d e ,  then we are forced to define   a b  ≺  d e  ≻  b c  ≺  e a  ≻  c d  ≺  a b  ≻  d e ,  a contradiction.  See also the following exercise.  11. We wish to show that, if p 1  . . . p t  is a permutation of {1, . . . , t}, the permutation xp 1  . . . xp t  is topologically sorted if and only if we have σp 1  ··· σp t  = σ1 ··· σt and p i  < p j  whenever σp i  = σp j  for i < j. We also want to show that, if xp 1  . . . xp t  and xq 1  . . . xq t  are distinct topological sortings, we have σp j  ̸= σq j  for some j. The first property follows by observing that xp 1  can be first in a topological sort if and only if σp 1  commutes with  yet is distinct from  σp 1 −1, . . . , σ1; and this condition ··· σt, so induction can be implies that σp 2  used. The second property follows because if j is minimal with p j  ̸= q j , we have, say, p j  < q j  and xp j  ̸≺ xq j  by definition of topological sorting; hence σp j  has no letters in common with σq j .  ··· σp 1 −1 σp 1 +1  ··· σp t  = σ1   5.1.2  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  599  c columns.  To get an arbitrary partial ordering, let the cycle σk consist of all ordered pairs  i, j  such that xi ≺ xj and either i = k or j = k; these ordered pairs are to appear in some arbitrary order as individual elements of the cycle. Thus the cycles for the partial ordering x1 ≺ x2, x3 ≺ x4, x1 ≺ x4 would be σ1 =   1, 2  1, 4  , σ2 =   1, 2  , σ3 =   3, 4  , σ4 =   1, 4  3, 4  . 12. No other cycles can be formed, since, for example, the original permutation con- If  a b c d  occurs s times, then  a b  must occur A − r − s tains no a times, since there are A− r columns a b , and only two kinds of cycles contribute to such columns. 13. In the two-line notation, first place A − t columns of the form d other t a’s in the second line, then place the b’s, and finally the remaining letters. 14. Since the elements below any given letter in the two-line notation for π− are in nondecreasing order, we do not always have  π− − = π; but it is true that   π− − − = π−. In fact, the identity  a, then put the   α β − =   α− β− − −  holds for all α and β.  See exercise 5–2.   i ni!   xj in their two-line notation is   Given a multiset whose distinct letters are x1 < ··· < xm, we can characterize its self-inverse permutations by observing that they each have a unique prime factorization of the form β1 ··· βm, where βj has zero or more prime factors  xj  ···  xj   xjxk1  ···  xjxkt , j < k1 ≤ ··· ≤ kt. For example,  a   a b   a b   b c   c  is a self-inverse permutation. The number of self-inverse permutations of {m · a, n · b} is therefore min m, n  + 1; and the corresponding number for {l · a, m · b, n · c} is the number of solutions of the inequalities x + y ≤ l, x + z ≤ m, y + z ≤ n in nonnegative integers x, y, z. The number of self-inverse permutations of a set is considered in Section 5.1.4. The number of permutations of {n1 · x1, . . . , nm · xm} having nij occurrences of i,j nij!, the same as the number having nij xi in the two-line notation. Hence there ought to be a better way to occurrences of xj xi define the inverse of a multiset permutation. For example, if the prime factorization ··· σ−2 σ−1 , where of π is σ1 σ2  x1 . . . xn − =  xn . . . x1 . Dominique Foata and Guo-Niu Han have observed that it would be even more desirable to define inverses in such a way that π and π− have the same number of inversions, because the generating function for inversions given the numbers nij is i,j nij!z times a power of z; see exercise 16. However, there does not seem  ··· σt as in Theorem C, we can define π− = σ−t  to be any natural way to define an involution having that property. 15. See Theorem 2.3.4.2D and Lemma 2.3.4.2E. Removing one arc of the directed graph must leave an oriented tree. 16. If x1 < x2 < ··· , the inversion table entries for the xj’s must have the form bj1 ≤ ··· ≤ bjnj where bjnj  the number of inversions of the rightmost xj  is at most nj+1 + nj+2 + ··· . So the generating function for the jth part of the inversion table is the generating function for partitions into at most nj parts, no part exceeding nj+1 + nj+2 +··· .

The number p of 0s in l π  and r π  is the number of columns j form of π for which j ≤ t < k; this is also the number of columns with k ≤ t < j. We can easily reconstruct π from the two-line forms of l π  and r π , because each k with j, k ≤ t occurs in l π , each column with t < j, k occurs in r π , and the column j remaining columns are obtained by merging j 0 of r π  from left to right.   ways  k of l π  with 0   b  Let π be a permutation of the stated form, and let σ be any permutation of P0 0n01n1 . . . mnm . Construct λ as follows: Delete the first n0 entries of σ; then replace the 0s by x’s, subscripted with the first n0 entries of π; replace the other elements by y’s, subscripted with the remaining nonzero entries of π. Also construct ρ as follows: Delete the 0s of σ, and replace the nj occurrences of j with xj or yj according as the columns k of π have k = 0 or k ̸= 0, from left to right. For example, if π =  00000011111222233333 23131302310102032010  and σ =  00000011111222233333 32313201103201300201 , we have λ = x2y2y3x3y1y1x1y2y3x3x1y2x3y1 and ρ = y3y2y3x1x3x2y1y1y3y2y1x3x2x1.

A direct proof of this result, due to E. A.

The number of readings is the number of runs in the inverse permutation. The first run corresponds to the first reading, etc. 21. It has n + 1 − k runs and requires n + 1 − j readings. 22. [J. Combinatorial Theory 1  1966 , 350–374.] If rs < n, some reading will pick up t > r elements, ai1 = j + 1, . . . , ait = j + t, where i1 < ··· < it. We cannot have am > am+1 for all m in the range ik ≤ m < ik+1, so the permutation contains at least t − 1 places with am < am+1; it therefore has at most n − t + 1 runs. On the other hand, consider the permutation αr . . . α2 α1, where block αj contains the numbers ≡ j  modulo r , in decreasing order; for example, when n = 9 and r = 4, this permutation is 8 4 7 3 6 2 9 5 1. If n ≥ 2r − 1, this permutation has r − 1 ascents, so it has n + 1 − r runs. Moreover, it requires exactly n + 1 − ⌈n r⌉ readings, if r > 1. We can rearrange the elements of {kr + 1, . . . , kr + r} arbitrarily without changing the number of runs, thereby reducing the number of readings to any desired value ≥ ⌈n r⌉. Now suppose rs ≥ n and r + s ≤ n+1 and r, s ≥ 1. By exercises 20 and 21 we can assume that r ≤ s, since the reflection of the inverse of a permutation with n + 1 − r runs and s readings has n + 1 − s runs and r readings. Then the construction in the  j≥0 anj  k  j   606  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.1.3  preceding paragraph handles all cases except those where s > n + 1−⌈n r⌉ and r ≥ 2.

[SIAM Review 3  1967 , 121–122.] Assume that the infinite permutation consists of independent samples from the uniform distribution. Let fk x  dx be the probability that the kth long run begins with x; and let g u, x  dx be the probability that a long run begins with x, when the preceding long run begins with u. Then f1 x  = 1,  0 fk u g u, x  du.

The following rule defines a one-to-one correspondence that takes a permutation a1 a2 . . . an with k descents into an n-node increasing forest with k + 1 leaves: The first root is a1, and its descendants are the forest corresponding to a2 . . . ak, where k is minimal such that ak+1 < a1 or k = n.

When pi is inserted into column t, let the element in column t − 1 be pj. Then  qj, pj  is in class t−1, qj < qi, and pj < pi; so, by induction, indices i1, . . . , it exist with the property. Conversely, if qj < qi and pj < pi and if  qj, pj  is in class t−1, then column t − 1 contains an element < pi when pi is inserted, so  qi, pi  is in class ≥ t. 3. The columns are the bumping sequences  9  when pi is inserted. Lines 1 and 2 reflect the operations on row 1, see  14 . If we remove columns in which line 2 has ∞ entries, lines 0 and 2 constitute the bumped array, as in  15 . The stated method for going from line k to line k + 1 is just the class-determination algorithm of the text. 4.  a  Use a case analysis, by induction on the size of the tableau, considering first the effect on row 1 and then the effect on the sequence of elements bumped from row 1.  b  Admissible interchanges can simulate the operations of Algorithm I, with the tableau represented as a canonical permutation before and after the algorithm. For example, we can transform 17 11 4 13 14 2 6 10 15 1 3 5 9 12 16 8 by a sequence of admissible interchanges  see  4  and  5  . 5. Admissible interchanges are symmetrical between left and right, and the canonical permutation for P obviously goes into P T when the insertion order is reversed. 6. Let there be t classes in all; exactly k of them have an odd number of elements, since the elements of a class have the form  into 17 11 13 4 10 14 2 6 9 15 1 3 5 8 12 16   pik , pi1 ,   pik−1 , pi2 ,  . . . ,   pi1 , pik .   See  18  and  22 .  The bumped two-line array has exactly t− k fixed points, because of the way it is constructed; hence by induction the tableau minus its first row has t− k columns of odd length. So the t elements in the first row lead to k odd-length columns in the whole tableau. 7. The number of columns, namely the length of row 1, is the number of classes  exercise 2 . The number of rows is the number of columns of P T, so exercise 5  or Theorem D  completes the proof. 8. With more than n2 elements, the corresponding P tableau must either have more than n rows or more than n columns. But there are n × n tableaux.

We prove inductively that, at step S3, P r−1 s and Pr s−1  are both less than P r+1 s and Pr s+1 . 11. We also need to know, of course, the element that was originally P11. Then it is possible to restore things using an algorithm remarkably similar to Algorithm S. 12. , the total distance traveled.

Assume that the elements permuted are {1, 2, . . . , n}, so that ai = 1; and assume that aj = 2. Case 1: j < i. Then 1 bumps 2, so row 1 of the tableau corresponding to a1 . . . ai−1 ai+1 . . . an is row 1 of P S; and the bumped permutation is the former bumped permutation except for its smallest element, 2, so we may use induction on n. Case 2: j > i. Apply Case 1 to P T, in view of exercise 5 and the fact that  P T  S =  P S T . 15.

Consider the cells  i, j  =  i1, j1 ,  i2, j2 , . . . ,  ia+b, ja+b  =  i′, j′  that hug the bottom of the If ja+1 = ja, the cell  ia, j1  has a hook of length a; otherwise  ia+b, ja+1  shape.

Nakayama was the first to consider hooks in the study of permutation groups, and he came close to discovering Theorem H.] 35. The execution of steps G3–G5 decreases exactly hij elements of the p array by 1 when qij is increased, because the algorithm follows a zigzag path from pn′ j j to pini. The next execution of those steps either starts with a larger value of j or stays above or equal to the preceding zigzag. Therefore the q array is filled from left to right and bottom to top; to reverse the process we proceed from right to left and top to bottom: H1. [Initialize.] Set pij ← 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ ni and 1 ≤ i ≤ n′1. Then set i ← 1 and  j ← n1. H2. [Find nonzero cell.] If qij > 0, go on to step H3.

Q1. [Loop on  i, j .] Perform steps Q2 and Q3 for all cells  i, j  of the array in lexicographic order  that is, from top to bottom, and from left to right in each row ; then stop. Q2. [Adjust Q.] Find the “first candidate”  r, s  by the rule below. Then set Qi k+1  ← Qik − 1 for j ≤ k < s. Q3. [Unfix P at  i, j .] Set K ← Prs. Then do the following operations until  r, s  =  i, j : If P r−1 s > Pr s−1 , set Prs ← P r−1 s and r ← r−1; otherwise set Prs ← Pr s−1  and s ← s − 1. Finally set Pij ← K. In step Q2, cell  r, s  is a candidate when s ≥ j and Qis ≤ 0 and r = i−Qis. Let T be the oriented tree of the hint. One of the basic invariants of Algorithm Q is that there will be a path from  r, s  to  i, j  in T whenever  r, s  is a candidate in step Q2. The reverse of that path can be encoded by a sequence of letters D, Q, and R, meaning that we start at  i, j , then go down  D  or to the right  R  or quit  Q . The first candidate is the one whose code is lexicographically first in alphabetic order; intuitively, it is the candidate with the “leftmost and bottommost” path.  For example, the candidates when  i, j  =  1, 1  in the example of part  e  are  3, 1 ,  4, 2 ,  2, 3 ,  2, 4 , and  1, 6 . Their respective codes are DDQ, DDDRQ, RDRQ, RDRRQ, and RRRRRQ; so the first is  4, 2 .  M. L.

Analiz i Ego Priloz. 26, 3  1992 , 80–82. The proof of correctness is nontrivial; a proof was given by J.-C. Novelli, I. Pak, and A. V. Stoyanovskii in Disc. Math. and Theoretical Comp.

See also Dan Romik, The Surprising Mathematics of Longest Increasing Subsequences  2014 , Chapter 4. 41.  Solution by R. W. Floyd.  A deletion-insertion operation essentially moves only ai. In a sequence of such operations, unmoved elements retain their relative order. There- fore if π can be sorted with k deletion-insertions, it has an increasing subsequence of length n − k; and conversely. Hence dis π  = n −  length of longest increasing subsequence of π  = n −  length of row 1 in Theorem A . compute this length is n lg n − n lg lg n + O n  [Discrete Math. 11  1975 , 29–35]. 42. Construct a multigraph that has vertices {0R, 1L, 1R, . . . , nL, nR,  n + 1 L} and edges kR −−−  k + 1 L for 0 ≤ k ≤ n; also include the edges 0R −−− 7R, 7L −−− 1L, 1R −−− 2L, 2R −−− 4L, 4R −−− 5L, 5R −−− 3L, 3R −−− 6R, 6L −−− 8L, which define the “bonds” of Lobelia fervens. Exactly two edges touch each vertex, so the connected components are cycles:  0R 1L 7L 6R 3R 4L 2R 3L 5R 6L 8L 7R  1R 2L  4R 5L . Any flip operation changes the number of cycles by −1, 0, or +1. Therefore we need at least five flips to reach the eight cycles  0R 1L  1R 2L  . . .  7R 8L . [J. Kececioglu and D. Sankoff, Algorithmica 13  1995 , 180–210.] The first flip must break the bond 6L−−−8L, because we get no new cycle when we break two bonds that have the same left-to-right orientation in the linear arrangement. This leaves five possibilities after one flip, namely gR7 g6gR3 gR5 gR4 gR2 gR1 , gR7 g1g2g4g5g3g6, gR7 g1g2g6gR3 gR5 gR4 , gR7 g1g2g4g5g6gR3 , and g6gR3 gR5 gR4 gR2 gR1 g7; four more flips suffice to sort all but the second of these. Incidentally, there are 27 · 7! = 645120 different possible arrangements of g1 . . . g7, and 179904 of them are at distance ≤ 5 from tobacco order.   5.2  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  615  [An efficient algorithm to find the best way to sort any signed permutation by reversals was first developed by S. Hannenhalli and P. Pevzner, JACM 46  1999 , 1–27. Improvements that solve the problem in O n1.5√ log n  time were subsequently found by H. Kaplan and E. Verbin, J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 70  2005 , 321–341; E. Tannier, A. Bergeron, and M.-F. Sagot, Discrete Applied Math. 155  2007 , 881–888.] 43. Denote an arrangement like gR7 g1g2g4g5g3gR6 by the signed permutation 7124536. If there is a negated element, say k is present but not k − 1, one flip will create the 2-cycle   k−1 R kL . Similarly, if k is present but not k + 1, a single flip creates  kR  k+1 L . And if all flips of that special kind remove all negated elements, a single flip creates two 2-cycles. If no negated elements are present and the permutation isn’t sorted, some flip will preserve the number of cycles. Hence we can sort in ≤ n flips if the given permutation has a negated element, ≤ n + 1 otherwise. When n is even, the permutation n  n−1  . . . 1 requires n + 1 flips, because it has one cycle after the first flip. When n > 3 is odd, the permutation 2 1 3 n  n−1  . . . 4 requires n + 1 by a similar argument. 44. Let ck be the number of cycles of length 2k in the multigraph of the previous answers. An upper bound on the average value of ck can be found as follows: The total number of potential 2k-cycles is 2k n+1 k  2k , because we can choose a sequence of k distinct edges from {0R−−−1L, . . . , nR−−− n+1 L} in  n+1 k ways and orient them in 2k ways; this counts each cycle 2k times, including impossible cases like  1R 2L 2R 3L  or  1R 2L 3L 2R 3R 4L  or  1R 2L 6R 7L 4L 3R 2R 3L 6L 5R . When k ≤ n, every possible 2k-cycle occurs in exactly 2n−k n − k ! signed permutations. For example, consider the case k = 5, n = 9, and the cycle  0R 1L 9L 8R 7R 8L 1R 2L 5L 4R . This cycle occurs in the multigraph if and only if the signed permutation begins with 4 and contains the substrings 9187 and 25 or their reverses; we obtain all solutions by finding all signed permutations of {1, 2, 3, 6} and replacing 1 by 9187, 2 by 25. Therefore E ck ≤ 1  2k  2k n + 1 k2n−k n − k ! 2nn! = 1 2 1 k + 1  n + 1 − k  . It follows that k=1 E ck + E cn+1 < Hn + 1. Since n + 1 − c is a lower bound on the number of flips, we need ≥ n + 1 − E c > n − Hn of them. [This proof uses ideas of V. Bafna and P. Pevzner, SICOMP 25  1996 , 272–289, who studied the more difficult problem of sorting unsigned permutations by reversals. In that problem, an interesting permutation that can be written as the product of non-disjoint cycles  1 2 3  3 4 5  5 6 7  . . . , ending with either  n−1 n  or  n−2 n−1 n  depending on whether n is even or odd, turns out to be the hardest to sort.]  E c =n  SECTION 5.2 1. Yes; i and j may run through the set of values 1 ≤ j < i ≤ N in any order, possibly in parallel and or as records are being read in. 2. The sorting is stable in the sense defined at the beginning of this chapter, because the algorithm is essentially sorting by lexicographic order on the distinct key-pairs  K1, 1 ,  K2, 2 , . . . ,  KN , N .  If we think of each key as extended on the right by its location in the file, no equal keys are present, and the sorting is stable.  3. It would sort, but not in a stable manner; if Kj = Ki and j < i, Rj will come after Ri in the final ordering. This change would also make Program C run more slowly. 4.

In order to avoid using N extra “tag” bits [see Section 1.3.3 and Cybernetics 1  1965 , 95], yet keep the running time essentially proportional to N, we may use the following algorithm based on the cycle structure of the permutation:  P1. [Loop on i.] Do step P2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N; then terminate the algorithm.   5.2  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  617  P2. [Is p i  = i?] Do steps P3 through P5, if p i  ̸= i. P3. [Begin cycle.] Set t ← Ri, j ← i. P4. [Fix Rj.] Set k ← p j , Rj ← Rk, p j  ← j, j ← k. If p j  ̸= i, repeat this  step.  P5. [End cycle.] Set Rj ← t, p j  ← j.  This algorithm changes p i , since the sorting application lets us assume that p i  is stored in memory. On the other hand, there are applications such as matrix transpo- sition where p i  is a function of i that is to be computed  not tabulated  in order to save memory space. In such a case we can use the following method, performing steps B1 through B3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.  B1. Set k ← p i . B2. If k > i, set k ← p k  and repeat this step. B3. If k < i, do nothing; but if k = i  this means that i is smallest in its cycle , we permute the cycle containing i as follows: Set t ← Ri; then while p k  ̸= i repeatedly set Rk ← Rp k  and k ← p k ; finally set Rk ← t.  This algorithm is similar to the procedure of J. Boothroyd [Comp. J. 10  1967 , 310], but it requires less data movement; some refinements have been suggested by I. D. G. MacLeod [Australian Comp. J. 2  1970 , 16–19]. For random permutations the analysis in exercise 1.3.3–14 shows that step B2 is performed  N + 1 HN − N steps on the average. See also the references in the answer to exercise 1.3.3–12.

The obvious way is to run through the list, replacing the link of the kth element by the number k, and then to rearrange the elements in a second pass. The following more direct method, due to M. D. MacLaren, is shorter and faster if the records are not too long.  Assume for convenience that 0 ≤ LINK P  ≤ N, for 1 ≤ P ≤ N, where Λ ≡ 0.   M1. [Initialize.] Set P ← HEAD, k ← 1. M2. [Done?] If P = Λ  or equivalently if k = N + 1 , the algorithm terminates. M3. [Ensure P ≥ k.] If P < k, set P ← LINK P  and repeat this step. M4. [Exchange.] Interchange Rk and R[P].  Assume that LINK k  and LINK P  are also interchanged in this process.  Then set Q ← LINK k , LINK k  ← P, P ← Q, k ← k + 1, and return to step M2.  A proof that MacLaren’s method is valid can be based on an inductive verification of the following property that holds at the beginning of step M2: The entries that are ≥ k in the sequence P, LINK P , LINK LINK P  , . . . , Λ are a1, a2, . . . , aN+1−k, where R1 ≤ ··· ≤ Rk−1 ≤ Ra1 ≤ ··· ≤ RaN+1−k is the desired final order of the records. Furthermore LINK j  ≥ j for 1 ≤ j < k, so that LINK j  = Λ implies j ≥ k. It is quite interesting to analyze MacLaren’s algorithm; one of its remarkable prop- erties is that it can be run backwards, reconstructing the original set of links from the final values of LINK 1  . . . LINK N . Each of the N! possible output configurations with j ≤ LINK j  ≤ N corresponds to exactly one of the N! possible input configurations. If A is the number of times P ← LINK P  in step M3, then N − A is the number of j such that LINK j  = j at the conclusion of the algorithm; this occurs if and only if j was largest in its cycle; hence N − A is the number of cycles in the permutation, and A =  min 0, ave N − HN , max N−1 .

Otherwise, if COUNT[Kr] < r set r ← r − 1 and repeat this step; if COUNT[Kr] = r, decrease both COUNT[Kr] and r by 1 and repeat this step. Otherwise set R ← Rr, j ← COUNT[Kr], COUNT[Kr] ← j − 1.

To prove that this procedure is valid, observe that at the beginning of step D6′ all records Rj such that j > r that are not in their final resting place must move to the left; when r = 0 there can’t be any such records since somebody must move right. The algorithm is elegant but not stable for equal keys. It is intimately related to Foata’s construction in Theorem 5.1.2B.  SECTION 5.2.1 1. Yes; equal elements are never moved across each other. 2. Yes. But the running time would be slower when equal elements are present, and the sorting would be just the opposite of stable. 3.

Hence both B − A and B are maximized when the input permutation is N . . . 2 1; they both are minimized when the input is 1 2 . . . N.

For Table 3, A = 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 6, B = 3 + 1 + 4 + 21 = 29; in Table 4, A = 4 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 8, B = 4 + 3 + 8 + 10 = 25; hence the running time of Program D comes to 786u and 734u, respectively. Although the number of moves has been cut from 41 to 25, the running time is not competitive with Program S since the bookkeeping time for four passes is wasted when N = 16. When sorting 16 items we will be better off using only two passes; a two-pass Program D begins to beat Program S at about N = 13, although they are fairly equal for awhile  and for such small N the length of the program is perhaps significant .   j    +  2   n − j + 1    ;  2   620  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.1  10.

On the other hand, the analogous change to Program S is usually insignificant, since only O log N  time is saved in that case unless the input is known to be pretty well ordered.  11.   cid:45   2n − i − j   cid:63 always changes the number of inversions by ±1, depending on  A2n =  hence A2nzn =  12.

Assume that a k- ordered file R1, . . . , RN has been h-sorted, and let 1 ≤ i ≤ N − k; we want to show that Ki ≤ Ki+k. Find u, v such that i ≡ u and i+k ≡ v  modulo h , 1 ≤ u, v ≤ h; and apply Lemma L with xj = Kv+ j−1 h, yj = Ku+ j−1 h. Then the first r elements Ku, Ku+h, . . . , Ku+ r−1 h of the y’s are respectively ≤ the last r elements Ku+k, Ku+k+h, . . . , Ku+k+ r−1 h of the x’s, where r is the greatest integer such that u + k +  r − 1 h ≤ N. 21. If xh + yk = x′h + y′k, we have  x − x′ h =  y′ − y k, so x′ = x + tk and y′ = y − th for some integer t. Let h′h + k′k = 1; then n =  nh′ h +  nk′ k, so every integer n has a unique representation of the form n = xh + yk where 0 ≤ x < k, and n is generable if and only if y ≥ 0. Let, similarly, hk − h − k − n = x′h + y′k; then  x + x′ h +  y + y′ k = hk − h− k. Hence x + x′ ≡ k − 1  modulo k  and we must have x + x′ = k − 1. Hence y + y′ = −1, and y ≥ 0 if and only if y′ < 0. 2 h−1  k−1  positive integers are unrepresentable in the stated form, a result originally due to Sylvester [Mathematical Questions, with their Solutions, from the ‘Educational Times’ 41  1884 , 21]. 22. To avoid cumbersome notation, consider s = 4, which is representative of the general case. Let nk be the smallest number that is congruent to k  modulo 15  and representable in the form 15a0 + 31a1 + ··· ; then we find easily that  The symmetry of this result shows that exactly 1  k = 0 1 2 3 4 9 10 11 12 13 14 nk = 0 31 62 63 94 125 126 127 158 189 190 221 252 253 254.  6  7  5  8  Hence 239 = 24 24−1 −1 is the largest unrepresentable number, and the total number of unrepresentables is  x4 =  n1 − 1 + n2 − 2 + ··· + n14 − 14  15  =  2 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 8  + 8 +  10 + 12 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 16  + 16 = 2x3 + 8 · 9;  in general, xs = 2xs−1 + 2s−1 2s−1 + 1 . For the other problem the answers are 22s + 2s + 2 and 2s−1 2s + s − 1  + 2, respectively. 23. Each of the N numbers has at most ⌈ hs+2 − 1  hs+1 − 1  hs⌉ inversions in its subfile. 24.  Solution obtained jointly with V. Pratt.  Construct the “h-recidivous permuta- tion” of {1, 2, . . . , N} as follows. Start with a1 . . . aN blank; then for j = 2, 3, 4, . . . do Step j: Fill in all blank positions ai from left to right, using the smallest number that has not yet appeared in the permutation, whenever  2h − 1 j − i is a positive integer representable as in exercise 22. Continue until all positions are filled. Thus the 2-recidivous permutation for N = 20 is  6 2 1 9 4 3 12 7 5 15 10 8 17 13 11 19 16 14 20 18.  The h-recidivous permutation is  2k − 1 -ordered for all k ≥ h. When 2h < j ≤ N  2h−1 , exactly 2h − 1 positions are filled during step j; the  k + 1 st of them adds at least 2h−1 − 2k to the number of moves required to  2h−1 − 1 -sort the permutation. Hence the number of moves to sort the h-recidivous permutation with increments hs = 2s − 1 when N = 2h+1 2h − 1  is > 23h−4 > 1 64 N 3 2. Pratt generalized this   5.2.1  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  623  construction to a large family of similar sequences, including  12 , in his Ph.D. thesis  Stanford University, 1972 . Heuristics that find permutations needing even more moves are discussed by H. Erkiö, BIT 20  1980 , 130–136. See also Weiss and Sedgewick, J.

Note that the FN+1 permutations can conveniently be repre- sented by “Morse code” sequences of dots and dashes, where a dash corresponds to an inversion; see exercise 4.5.3–32. Hence we have found the total number of dashes among all Morse code sequences of length N.   b  This is obvious if m > 1  Our derivation shows that a random 3- and 2-ordered permutation has roughly 5 ≈ .276N inversions. But if a random permutation is 5 ϕ−1 + 2ϕ−2 N = ϕ−1N  1 3-sorted, then 2-sorted, exercise 42 shows that it has ≈ N 4 inversions; if it is 2-sorted, then 3-sorted, it has ≈ N 3. 26. Yes; a shortest example is 4 1 3 7 2 6 8 5, which has nine inversions. In general, the construction a3k+s = 3k + 4s for −1 ≤ s ≤ 1 yields files that are 3-, 5-, and 7-ordered, having approximately 4 3 N inversions. When N mod 3 = 2 this construction is best possible. 27.  a  See J. Algorithms 15  1993 , 101–124. A simpler proof, which shows that c can be any constant < 1 2, was found independently by C. G.

No nontrivial lower bounds are yet known for the asymptotic average running time. 28. 209 109 41 19 5 1, from  11 . But better sequences are possible; see exercise 29. 29. Experiments by C. Tribolet in 1971 resulted in the choices 373 137 53 19 7 3 1  Bave ≈ 7210  and 317 101 31 11 3 1  Bave ≈ 8170 . [The first of these yields a sorting time of ≈ 127720u, compared to ≈ 128593u when the same data are sorted using increments  11 .] In general Tribolet suggests letting hs be the nearest prime number to N s t. Experiments by Shelby Siegel in 1972 indicate that the best number of increments in such a method, for N ≤ 10000, is t ≈ 4 3 ln N 5.75 . On the other hand, Marcin Ciura’s experiments [Lect. Notes Comp. Sci. 2138  2001 , 106–117] indicate that the minimum 7-pass Bave  ≈ 6879  is obtained with increments 229 96 41 19 10 4 1, while the sequence 737 176 69 27 10 4 1 yields the smallest total sorting time  ≈ 125077u . The best three-increment sequence, according to extensive tests by Carole M. McNamee, appears to be 45 7 1  Bave ≈ 18240 . For four increments, 91 23 7 1 was the winner in her tests  Bave ≈ 11865 , but a rather broad range of increments gave roughly the same performance. 30. The number of integer points in the triangular region  {x ln 2 + y ln 3 < ln N, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0}  is  1 2 log2N  log3N  + O log N .  While we are h-sorting, the file is already 2h-ordered and 3h-ordered, by Theorem K; hence exercise 25 applies.   5.2.1  624  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  31. 01 START ENT3 T  02 1H 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 2H 10 4H 11 12 6H 13 14 7H 15 16 8H 17 18 19 9H 20 21 22  1 T T T T T T T  8F  6F 0:2  7F 0:2  4F 0:2   LD4 H,3 ENN2 -INPUT-N,4 ST2 ST2 ST2 ENT2 0,4 JMP 9F N T − S − B + A LDA INPUT+N,1 CMPA INPUT+N-H,1 N T − S − B + A N T − S − B + A JGE LDX INPUT+N-H,1 STX STA INPUT+N-H,1 INC1 0,4 INC1 0,4 J1NP 2B DEC2 1 ENT1 -N,2 8B J2P DEC3 1 J3P 1B  N T − B + A N T − B + A  T + S T + S  INPUT+N,1  B B B B  T T  S  Here A is related to right-to-left maxima in the same way that A in Program D is related to left-to-right minima; both quantities have the same statistical behavior.

When N = 1000 there are 40 increments, 972, 864, 768, 729, . . . , 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1; empirical tests like those in Table 6 give A ≈ 875, B ≈ 4250, and a total time of about 268000u  more than twice as long as Program D with the increments of exercise 28 .  Instead of storing the increments in an auxiliary table, it is convenient to generate  them as follows on a binary machine:  P1. Set m ← 2⌈lg N⌉−1, the largest power of 2 less than N. P2. Set h ← m. P3. Use h as the increment for one sorting pass. P4. If h is even, set h ← h + h 2; then if h < N, return to P3. P5. Set m ← ⌊m 2⌋ and if m ≥ 1 return to P2.

The elements Kj of concern to us have j ≡ 1  modulo 5  and j ≡ 3 or 7  modulo 12 ; hence j ≡ 51 or 31  modulo 60 , and we want to compute the average value of g 51, 31  where  1≤i<j≤k  √  2  2  .  g x, y  = r x, y  =  j<k  j   [Kx+ghj > Ky+ghk] + [Ky+ghj > Kx+ghk]  + r x, y  ,  [Kmin x,y +ghj > Kmax x,y +ghj ] < N gh + 1 .

This is clear whenever π′ is one step above π, and exercise 5.1.1–29 shows that there is a path of adjacent transpositions from π to any permutation above it.   b  Yes. Similarly, if π is above π′, πR is below π′R.  c  No; 2 1 3 is neither above nor below 3 1 2, but 2 1 3 ≤ 3 1 2. [The partial ordering π ≤ π′ was first discussed by C.

Many mathematicians now call it the “Bruhat order” of permutations, while aboveness is called the “weak Bruhat order” — although aboveness is actually a stronger condition, because it holds less often. Only the weak order defines a lattice.]  SECTION 5.2.2 1. No; it has 2m+1 fewer inversions, where m ≥ 0 is the number of elements ak such that i   ak > aj.

Any exchange of elements in the same cycle increases the number of cycles by 1; any exchange of elements in different cycles decreases the number by 1.  This is essentially the content of exercise 2.2.4–3.  A completely sorted permutation is characterized by having n cycles. Hence xch π  is n minus the number of cycles in π.  Algorithm 5.2.3S does exactly xch π  exchanges; see exercise 5.2.3–4.  3. Yes; equal elements are never moved across each other. 4.

Steps Q3 and Q4 make only a single change to i and j before exiting to Q5; the partitioning process for Rl . . . Rr ends with j = ⌈ l + r  2⌉ in step Q7, bisecting the subfile as perfectly as possible. Quantitatively speaking, we replace  17  by A = 1, B = ⌊ N − 1  2⌋, C = N +  N mod 2 ; this puts us essentially in the best case of the algorithm  see exercise 27 , except that B ≈ 1 2 C. If the “<” signs in steps Q3 and Q4 are changed to “≤ ,” the algorithm won’t sort any more; even if we assume “<” signs in  13 , it will interchange R0 with R1, then the third partitioning phase will move the original R0 to position R2, etc. — a real catastrophe. 19.

The partitioning phase ends with j = s, hence C − C′ = N + 1 − s is the number of times j decreases. We must also have i = s + 1 in step Q7 when the keys are distinct, since i = j implies Kj = K; thus C′ = s. 22.

The leading term n ln n   H2t+2 − Ht+1  was discovered by M. H. van Emden [CACM 13  1970 , 563–567] using an information-theoretic approach. In fact, suppose we wish to analyze any partitioning process such that the left subfile contains at most xN elements with 0 f x  dx, as N → ∞, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1; van Emden proved that the average number of comparisons required to sort the file completely is asymptotic 0  f x  + f 1 − x  x ln x dx. This formula applies to radix exchange as well as to quicksort and various other methods. See also H. Hurwitz, CACM 14  1971 , 99–102.  30. Solution 1  of historic interest : Each subfile may be identified by four quantities  l, r, k, X , where l and r are the boundaries  as presently , k indicates the number of words of the keys that are known to be equal throughout the subfile, and X is a lower bound for the  k + 1 st words of the key. Assuming nonnegative keys, we have  l, r, k, X  =  1, N, 0, 0  initially. When partitioning a file, we let K be the  k + 1 st If K > X, partitioning takes place with all keys ≥ K at word of the test key Kq. the right and all keys < K at the left  looking only at the  k + 1 st word of the key each time ; the partitioned subfiles get the respective identifications  l, j−1, k, X  and  j, r, k, K . But if K = X, partitioning takes place with all keys > K at the right and all keys ≤ K [actually = K] at the left; the partitioned subfiles get the respective identifications  l, j, k + 1, 0  and  j + 1, r, k, K . In both cases we are unsure that Rj is in its final position since we haven’t looked at the  k + 2 nd words. Obvious further changes are made to handle boundary conditions properly. By adding a fifth “upper bound” component, the method could be made symmetrical between left and right.  Solution 2, by Bentley and Sedgewick [SODA 8  1997 , 360–369]: In a subfile identified by  l, r, k , let K be word k + 1 of Kq as in solution 1, but use the algorithm of exercise 41 to tripartition the subfile into  l, i − 1, k ,  i, j, k + 1 ,  j + 1, r, k  for the cases  K. This approach, which the authors call multikey quicksort, is significantly better than solution 1, and it is competitive with the fastest known methods for sorting strings of characters. 31. Go through a normal partitioning process, with R1 finally falling into position Rs. If s = m, stop; if s < m, use the same technique to find the  m− s th smallest element of the right-hand subfile; and if s > m, find the mth smallest element of the left-hand subfile.

Dromey [Software Practice & Experience 16  1986 , 981–986] has observed that fewer comparisons and exchanges are needed if we stop each partitioning stage as soon as i or j has reached position m. 32. The recurrence is C11 = 0 and Cnm = n + 1 +  Anm + Bnm  n for n > 1, where  Anm =   1≤s<m  C n−s  m−s   and  Bnm =   C s−1 m,  m<s≤n  3 + O m−1  ≈ 3.39n.  for 1 ≤ m ≤ n. Since A n+1  m+1  = Anm + Cnm and B n+1 m = Bnm + Cnm, we can first find a formula for the quantity Dn =  n+1 C n+1  m+1  − nCnm, then sum this to obtain the answer 2  n+1 Hn− n+2−m Hn+1−m− m+1 Hm+n+ 5 3 δm1− 3 − 1 3 δmn− 1 3 1− δm1  = 3 δmnδm1.

The probability that node i is a common ancestor of nodes j and k in a random binary search tree is 1  max i, j, k  − min i, j, k  + 1 . We obtain the average number of comparisons from the facts that E Xjk = Hk + Hn+1−j + 1 − 2Hk−j+1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ k, and Pr node m is a leaf  = Pr m isn’t followed by m ± 1 in a random [See R.

Asymptotically faster methods are discussed in exercise 5.3.3–24. 33. Proceed as in the first stage of radix exchange, using the sign instead of bit 1. 34. We can avoid testing whether or not i ≤ j, as soon as we have found at least one 0 bit and at least one 1 bit in each stage — that is, after making the first exchange in each stage.

In general, the K = L = R = 0, S = 1 quantities A, C, G, K, L, R, and S depend only on the set of keys in the file, not on their initial order; only B and X are influenced by the initial order of the keys.  n−j δnjaj = an.  b  ⟨δn0⟩;  −a m 1−a n−m⟩.  c  Writing the relations to be yk =  36.  a  n  −1 k+jaj = n ⟨−δn1⟩; ⟨ −1 mδnm⟩; ⟨ 1−a n⟩; ⟨ n k≥2n proved as xn = yn = an + zn, we have yn = an + zn by part  a ; also 21−n 2−n⟩ for an arbitrary sequence of constants c0, c1, c2, . . . . 37. ⟨ that, in terms of the generating function A z  = anzn n!, we have ˆA z  = ezA −z ;  [This answer, although correct, does not reveal immediately that ⟨1  n + 1 ⟩ and ⟨n − δn1⟩ are such sequences!

A partitioning stage that yields a left subfile of size s and a right subfile of size N − s makes the following contributions to the total running time:  A = 1, B = t, C = N, K = δs1, L = δs0, R = δsN , X = h,  where t is the number of keys K1, . . . , Ks with bit b equal to 1, and h is bit b of Ks+1; if s = N, then h = 0.

Solving these recurrences by the method of exercise 36 yields the formulas AN = VN − UN + 1, BN = 1 4 UN + N − 1 , CN = VN + N, KN = N 2, LN = RN = 1 39. Each stage of quicksort puts at least one element into its final position, but this need not happen during radix exchange  see Table 3 . 40. If we switch to straight insertion whenever r − l < M in step R2, the problem doesn’t arise unless more than M equal elements occur. If the latter is a likely prospect, we can test whether or not Kl = ··· = Kr whenever j < l or j = r in step R8. 41. Lutz M. Wegner [IEEE Trans. C-34  1985 , 362–367] has discussed several ap- proaches, of which the following  as simplified by Bentley and McIlroy in Software Practice & Exp. 23  1993 , 1256–1258  appears to be best in practice. The basic idea is to work with the five-part array  = K  < K  ?  > K  = K  l  a  b  c  d  r  until the middle part is empty, then swap the two ends into the middle.  D1. [Initialize.] Set a ← b ← l, c ← d ← r. D2. [Increase b until Kb > K.] If b ≤ c and Kb < K, increase b by 1 and repeat this step. If b ≤ c and Kb = K, exchange Ra ↔ Rb, increase a and b by 1, and repeat this step.  D3. [Decrease c until Kc   K, decrease c by 1 and repeat this step. If b ≤ c and Kc = K, exchange Rc ↔ Rd, decrease c and d by 1, and repeat this step.  D4. [Exchange.] If b < c, exchange Rb ↔ Rc, increase b by 1, decrease c by 1, and return to D2. D5. [Cleanup.] Exchange Rl+k ↔ Rc−k for 0 ≤ k < min a−l, b−a ; also exchange Rb+k ↔ Rr−k for 0 ≤ k < min d − c, r − d . Finally set i ← l + b − a, j ← r − d + c. Straightforward modifications to step D1 will handle degenerate cases efficiently and ensure that a < b and c < d before we get to D2. Then the tests “b ≤ c” in D2 and D3 will be unnecessary; see exercise 24. Furthermore, this change will keep those steps from needlessly exchanging records with themselves.  One of the main applications of sorting is to bring records with equal keys to- gether. Therefore this tripartitioning scheme is often preferable to the bipartitioning   636  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.2  of Algorithm Q. The exchanges in step D5 are efficient because all records with keys equal to K are now in their final resting place.  43. As a → 0+, we have  1  This exercise is due to W. H. J. Feijen, who called it the “Dutch national flag problem”: Given a set of red, white, and blue tokens arranged randomly in a column, decide how to swap pairs of tokens so that the red ones will all be at the top and the blue ones all at the bottom, while looking at each token only once and using only a [See E.

This program essentially exchanges Rl+1 with R⌊ l+r  2⌋  and sorts the three records Rl, Rl+1, Rr, then applies normal partitioning to Rl+1 . . . Rr−1. It is tempting to save a few lines of code by simply putting the median element in rA, moving Rl to the median’s former place, and using Program Q as it stands. But such an approach has bad consequences, since it requires order N 2 steps to sort the file N N−1 . . . 1.  This amazing result, first noticed by D. B.

No; consider the case K1 > K2 = ··· = KN. But the method using ∞  described just before Algorithm S  is stable. 2. Traversing a linear list stored sequentially in memory is often slightly faster if we scan the list from higher indices to lower, since it is usually easier for a computer to test if an index is zero than to test if it exceeds N.  For the same reason, the search in step S2 runs from j down to 1; but see exercise 8!  3.  a  The permutation a1 . . . aN−1 N occurs for inputs N a2 . . . aN−1 a1, a1 N a3 . . . aN−1 a2,  . . . , a1 a2 . . . aN−2 N aN−1, a1 . . . aN−1 N.   b  The average number of times the maximum is changed during the first iteration of step S2 is HN − 1, as shown in Section 1.2.10. [Hence BN can be found from Eq. 1.2.7– 8 .] 4. If the input is a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , N}, the number of times i = j in step S3 is exactly one less than the number of cycles in the permutation.  Indeed, it is not hard to show that steps S2 and S3 simply remove element j from its cycle; hence S3 is   640  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.3  √  inactive only when j was the smallest element in its cycle.  By Eq. 1.3.3– 21  we could save HN − 1 of the N − 1 executions of step S3, on the average.  Thus it is inefficient to insert an extra test “i = j?” before step S3. Instead of testing i versus j, however, we could lengthen the program for S2 slightly, duplicating part of the code, so that S3 never is encountered if the initial guess Kj is not changed during the search for the maximum; this would make Program S a wee bit faster. 5.  N − 1  +  N − 3  + ··· = ⌊N 2 4⌋. 6.  a  If i ̸= j in step S3, that step decreases the number of inversions by 2m − 1, where m is one more than the number of keys in Ki+1 . . . Kj−1 that lie between Ki and Kj; clearly m is not less than the contribution to B on the previous step S2. Now apply the observation of exercise 4, connecting cycles to the condition i = j.  b  Every permutation can be obtained from N . . . 2 1 by successive interchanges of adjacent elements that are out of order.  Apply, in reverse sequence, the interchanges that sort the permutation into decreasing order.  Every such operation decreases I by one and changes C by ±1. Hence no permutation has a value of I − C exceeding the [By exercise 5 the inequality B ≤ ⌊N 2 4⌋ is best corresponding value for N . . . 2 1. possible.] 7. A. C. Yao, “On straight selection sort,” Computer Science Technical Report 185  Princeton University, 1988 , showed that the variance is αN 1.5 + O N 1.495 log N , e ≈ 0.9129; he also conjectured that the actual error term is where α = 4 π ln 4 3 significantly smaller. 8. We can start the next iteration of step S2 at position Ki, provided that we have remembered max  K1, . . . , Ki−1 . One way to keep all of this auxiliary information is to use a link table L1 . . .

Step H5 is inactive unless Kr < Kr+1, when step H6 will go to H8 anyway.  To ensure that K ≥ Kr+1 throughout the algorithm, we may start with KN+1 ≤ min K1, . . . , KN ; instead of setting Rr ← R1 in step H2, set Rr+1 ← RN+1 and RN+1 ← R1; also set R2 ← RN+1 after r = 1.  This trick does not speed up the algorithm nor does it make Program H any shorter.  14. When inserting an element, give it a key that is less  or greater  than all previously assigned keys, to get the effect of a simple queue  or stack, respectively . 15.

The sieve of Eratosthenes, as implemented in exercise 4.5.4–8, is a O N log log N  method requiring considerably more random access storage. More efficient implementations are discussed in Section 7.1.3. 16.  I1. [Make a new leaf j.] Set K ← key to be inserted; j ← n + 1. I2. [Find parent of j.] Set i ← ⌊j 2⌋. I3.

The file 1 2 3 goes into the heap 3 2 1 with Algorithm H, but into 3 1 2 with exercise 16. [Note: The latter method of heap creation has a worst case of order N log N; but empirical tests have shown that the average number of iterations of step 2 during the creation of a heap is less than about 2.28N, for random input. R. Hayward and C. McDiarmid [J. Algorithms 12  1991 , 126–153] have proved rigorously that the constant of proportionality lies between 2.2778 and 2.2994.] 18.

The method is essentially the same as in exercise 16, but with a different starting place in the heap. The net change to the file is the same as in Algorithm H. Empirical tests on this method show that the number of times Rj ← Ri occurs per siftup during the selection phase is  0, 1, 2  with respective probabilities  .837, .135, .016 . This method   5.2.3  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  643  makes Program H somewhat longer but improves its asymptotic speed to  13N lg N + O N  u. A MIX instruction to halve the value of an index register would be desirable. C. J. H. McDiarmid and B. A. Reed [J. Algorithms 10  1989 , 352–365] have proved that this modification also saves an average of  3β−8 N ≈ 0.232N comparisons during the heap-creation phase, where β is defined in the answer to exercise 27. For further analysis of Floyd’s improvement, see I. Wegener, Theoretical Comp. Sci. 118  1993 , 81–98.  J. Wu and H. Zhu [J. Comp. Sci. and Tech. 9  1994 , 261–266] have observed that binary search can also be used, so that each siftup of the selection phase involves at most lg N + lg lg N comparisons and lg N moves. 19. Proceed as in the revised siftup algorithm of exercise 18, with K = KN, l = 1, and r = N − 1, starting with a given value of j in step H3. 20.

We know by Theorem H that this upper bound on B is best possible during the heap-creation phase. Furthermore it is interesting to note that there is a unique heap containing the keys {1, 2, . . . , N} such that K is identically equal to 1 throughout the selection phase of Algorithm H.  For example, when N = 7 that heap is 7 5 6 2 4 3 1; it is not difficult to pass from N to N + 1.  This heap gives the maximum value of B  as well as the maximum value ⌈N 2⌉−1 of D  for the selection phase of heapsort, so the best possible upper bound on B for the entire sort is N − ν N  + N⌊lg N⌋ − 2⌊lg N⌋+1 + 2.  k=1⌊lg k⌋2 =  N + 1 − 2n n2 +0≤k<nk22k =  N + 1 n2 −  2n − 3 2n+1 − 6,  where n = ⌊lg N⌋  see exercise 4.5.2–22 ; hence the variance of the last siftup is βN =   N + 1 n2 −  2n− 3 2n+1 − 6  N −   N + 1 n + 2− 2n+1 2  N 2 = O 1 .

Let A be an array of 2n elements such that A[2⌊i 2⌋] ≤ A[2i] and A[2⌊i 2⌋ − 1] ≥ A[2i − 1] for 1 < i ≤ n; furthermore we require that A[2i − 1] ≥ A[2i] for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.  The latter condition holds for all i if and only if it holds for n 2 < i ≤ n, because of the heap structure.  This “twin heap” contains 2n elements; to handle an odd number of elements, we simply keep one element off to the side. Appropriate modifications of the other algorithms in this section can be used to maintain twin heaps, and it is interesting to work out the details. This idea was independently discovered and developed further by J. van Leeuwen and D. Wood [Comp. J. 36  1993 , 209–216], who called the structure an “interval heap.” 32. In any heap of N distinct elements, the largest m = ⌈N 2⌉ elements form a subtree. At least ⌊m 2⌋ of them must be nonleaves of that subtree, since a binary tree with k leaves has at least k − 1 nonleaves. Therefore at least ⌊m 2⌋ of the largest m elements appear in the first ⌊N 2⌋ positions of the heap. Those elements must be promoted to the root position before reaching their final destinations; so their movement contributes 2 m lg m + O m  to B, by exercise 1.2.4–42. Thus Bmin N  ≥ 4 N lg N + O N + Bmin ⌊N 2⌋ , and the result follows by induction on N. [I. Wegener, 1 Theoretical Comp. Sci. 118  1993 , 81–98, Theorem 5.1. Schaffer and Sedgewick, and independently Bollobás, Fenner, and Frieze, have constructed permutations that require 2 N lg N + O N log log N  promotions; see J.

[List merge.]  If Q = Λ, set D ← DIST P  and go to M3.  If P = Λ, set P ← Q, D ← DIST P , and go to M3. Otherwise if KEY P  ≥ KEY Q , set T ← RIGHT P , RIGHT P  ← R, R ← P, P ← T and repeat step M2. If KEY P  < KEY Q , set T ← RIGHT Q , RIGHT Q  ← R, R ← Q, Q ← T and repeat step M2.  This step essentially merges the two “right lists” of the given trees, temporarily inserting upward pointers into the RIGHT fields.   M3. [Done?] If R = Λ, terminate the algorithm; P points to the answer. M4. [Fix DISTs.] Set Q ← RIGHT R .  If DIST LEFT R   < D, then set D ← DIST LEFT R   + 1, RIGHT R  ← LEFT R , LEFT R  ← P; otherwise set D ← D + 1, RIGHT R  ← P. Finally set DIST R  ← D, P ← R, R ← Q, and return to M3.  34. Starting with the recurrence   for parts of the overall generating function L z  =  Lm+1 z  = Lm z   L1 z  = z,   L z  − m−1 n≥0 lnzn =   Lk z   k=1  ,  m≥1 Lm z , where Lm z  = z2m−1 + ··· generates leftist trees with shortest path length m from root m≥1 Lm z 2, and that to Λ, Rainer Kemp has proved that L z  = z + 1 a ≈ 0.25036 and b ≈ 2.7494879 [Inf. Proc. Letters 25  1987 , 227–232; Random Graphs ’87  1990 , 103–130]. Luis Trabb Pardo noticed in 1978 that the generating function G z  = zL z  satisfies the elegant relation G z  = z + G zG z  .  2 L z 2 + 1 2   646  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.3  35. Let the DIST field of the deleted node be d0, and let the DIST field of the merged subtrees be d1. If d0 = d1, we need not go up at all. If d0 > d1, then d1 = d0 − 1; and if we go up n levels, the new DIST fields of the ancestors of P must be, respectively, d1 + 1, d1 + 2, . . . , d1 + n. If d0 < d1, the upward path must go only leftwards. 36. Instead of a general priority queue, it is simplest to use a doubly linked list; move nodes to one end of the list whenever they are used, and delete nodes from the other end. [See the discussion of self-organizing files in Section 6.1.] 37. In an infinite heap, the kth-largest element is equally likely to appear in the left or the right subheap of its larger ancestors. Thus we can use the theory of digital search trees, obtaining e k  = C k − C k−1 in the notation of Eq. 6.3– 13 . By exercise 6.3–28 2 − α+ δ0 k + O k−1  ≈ lg k− .274, where α is defined we have e k  = lg k + γ  ln 2 + 1 in  19  and δ0 k  is a periodic function of lg k. [P. V. Poblete, BIT 33  1993 , 411–412.] 38. M0 = ∅; M1 = {1}; MN = {N} ⊎ M2k−1 ⊎ MN−2k for N > 1, where k = ⌊lg 2N 3 ⌋.  SECTION 5.2.4 1. Start with i1 = ··· = ik = 1, j = 1. Repeatedly find min x1i1 , . . . , xkik  = xrir, and set zj = xrir, j ← j + 1, ir ← ir + 1.  In this case the use of xi mi+1  = ∞ is a decided convenience.  When k is moderately large, it is desirable to keep the keys x1i1 , . . . , xkik in a tree structure suited to repeated selection, as discussed in Section 5.2.3, so that only ⌊lg k⌋ comparisons are needed to find the new minimum each time after the first. Indeed, this is a typical application of the principle of “smallest in, first out” in a priority queue. The keys can be maintained as a heap, and ∞ can be avoided entirely. See the further discussion in Section 5.4.1. 2. Let C be the number of comparisons; we have C = m + n − S, where S is the number of elements transmitted in step M4 or M6. The probability that S ≥ s is easily seen to be   m + n − s   m + n   m + n − s      qs =  +  m  n  m  for 1 ≤ s ≤ m + n; qs = 0 for s > m + n. Hence the mean of S is µmn = q1 + q2 +··· = m  n + 1  + n  m + 1  [see exercises 3.4.2–5, 6], and the variance is σ2 mn =  q1 + 3q2 + 5q3 +···  − µ2 mn. Thus  mn = m 2m+ n   n+1  n+2 + m+2n n  m+1  m+2 − µ2 C =  min min m, n , ave m + n − µmn, max m + n − 1, dev σmn .  When m = n the average was first computed by H. Nagler, CACM 3  1960 , 618–620; it is asymptotically 2n − 2 + O n−1 , with a standard deviation of 2 + O n−1 . Thus C hovers close to its maximum value. 3. M2′. If Ki   K′j, go to M5′.  M7′. Set K′′k ← K′j, k ← k+1, i ← i+1, j ← j +1. If i > M, go to M4′; otherwise  √  if j > N, go to M6′; otherwise return to M2′.   Appropriate modifications are made to other steps of Algorithm M. Again many special cases disappear if we insert artificial keys KM+1 = K′N+1 = ∞ at the end of the files.  4. The sequence of elements that appears at a fixed internal node of the selection tree, as time passes, is obtained by merging the sequences of elements that appear at   5.2.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  647  the children of that node.  The discussion in Section 5.2.3 is based on selecting the largest element, but it could equally well have reversed the order.  So the operations involved in tree selection are essentially the same as those involved in merging, but they are performed in a different sequence and using different data structures.  Another relation between merging and tree selection is indicated in exercise 1. Note that an N-way merge of one-element files is a selection sort; compare also four- way merging of  A, B, C, D  to two-way merging of  A, B ,  C, D , then  AB, CD . 5. In step N6 we always have Ki < Ki−1 ≤ Kj; in N10, Kj < Kj+1 < Ki. 6. For example, 2 6 4 10 8 14 12 16 15 11 13 7 9 3 5 1; after one pass, two of the expected stepdowns disappear: 1 2 5 6 7 8 13 14 16 15 12 11 10 9 4 3. This possibility was first noted by D. A. Bell, Comp. J. 1  1958 , 74. Quirks like this make it almost hopeless to carry out a precise analysis of Algorithm N. 7. ⌈lg N⌉, if N > 1.  Consider how many times p must be doubled until it is ≥ N.  8. If N is not a multiple of 2p, there is one short run on the pass, and it is always near the middle; letting its length be t, we have 0 ≤ t < p. Step S12 handles the cases where the short run is to be “merged” with an empty run, or where t = 0; otherwise we have essentially x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ··· ≤ xp  yt ≥ ··· ≥ y1. If xp ≤ yt, the left-hand run is exhausted first, and step S6 will take us to S13 after xp has been transmitted. On the other hand, if xp > yt, the right-hand side will be artificially exhausted, but Kj = xp will never be < Ki in step S3! Thus S6 will eventually take us to S13 in all cases. 10. For example, Algorithm M can merge elements xj+1 . . . xj+m with xj+m+1 . . . xj+m+n into positions x1 . . . xm+n of an array without conflict, if j ≥ n. With care we can exploit this idea so that N +2⌊lg N⌋−1 locations are required for an entire sort. But [Comp. J. 1 the program seems to be rather complicated compared to Algorithm S.  1958 , 75; see also L. S. Lozinskii, Kibernetika 1, 3  1965 , 58–62.] 11. Yes. This can be seen, for example, by considering the relation to tree selection mentioned in exercise 4. But Algorithms N and S are obviously not stable. 12. Set L0 ← 1, t ← N + 1; then for p = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1, do the following: If Kp ≤ Kp+1 set Lp ← p + 1; otherwise set Lt ← − p + 1 , t ← p.  Finally, set Lt ← 0, LN ← 0, LN+1 ← LN+1.   Stability is preserved. The number of passes is ⌈lg r⌉, where r is the number of ascending runs in the input; the exact distribution of r is analyzed in Section 5.1.3. We may conclude that natural merging is preferable to straight merging when linked allocation is being used, although it was inferior for sequential allocation.  13. The running time for N ≥ 3 is  11A + 6B + 3B′ + 9C + 2C′′ + 4D + 5N + 9 u, where A is the number of passes; B = B′+B′′ is the number of subfile-merge operations performed, where B′ is the number of such merges in which the p subfile was exhausted first; C = C′ + C′′ is the number of comparisons performed, where C′ is the number of such comparisons with Kp ≤ Kq; D = D′ + D′′ is the number of elements remaining in subfiles when the other subfile has been exhausted, where D′ is the number of such elements belonging to the q subfile. In Table 3 we have A = 4, B′ = 6, B′′ = 9, C′ = 22, C′′ = 22, D′ = 10, D′′ = 10, total time = 761u.  The comparable Program 5.2.1L takes only 433u, when improved as in exercise 5.2.1–33, so we can see that merging isn’t especially efficient when N is small.  Algorithm L does a sequence of merges on subfiles whose sizes  m, n  can be determined as follows: Let N − 1 =  bk . . . b1b0 2 in binary notation. There are   648  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.4   bk . . . bj+1 2 “ordinary” merges with  m, n  =  2j, 2j , for 0 ≤ j < k; and there are “special” merges with  m, n  =  2j, 1 +  bj−1 . . . b0 2  whenever bj = 1, for 0 ≤ j ≤ k. For example, when N = 14 there are six ordinary  1, 1  merges, three ordinary  2, 2  merges, one ordinary  4, 4  merge, and the special merges deal with subfiles of sizes  1, 1 ,  4, 2 ,  8, 6 . The multiset MN of merge sizes  m, n  can also be described by the recurrence relations  M1 = ∅;  M2k+r = { 2k, r } ⊎ M2k ⊎ Mr  for 0 < r ≤ 2k.  C′ + D′′ =k  2 j , C′′ + D′ =k  j=0 bj2j 1 + 1  j=0 bj 1 + 2j  1  only B′, C′, D′ need to be analyzed further.  It follows that, regardless of the input distribution, we have A = ⌈lg N⌉, B = N−1, 2 j + bj+1 + ··· + bk  ; hence If the input to Algorithm L is random, each of the merging operations satisfies the conditions of exercise 2, and is independent of the behavior of the other merges; so the distribution of B′, C′, D′ is the convolution of their individual distributions for each subfile merge. The average values for such a merge are B′ = n  m + n , C′ = mn  n + 1 , D′ = n  m + 1 . Sum these over all relevant  m, n  to get the exact average values.  When N = 2k we have, of course, the simplest situation; B′ave = 1  2 B, C′ave = 1  2 Cave,  j=1 2k−j2j  2j−1 + 1   = α′N + O 1 , where  C + D = kN, and Dave =k 2n + 1 = α + 1 1  α′ =  n≥0  2 − 2  n≥1  1  4n − 1  = 1.26449 97803 48444 20919 13197 47255 49848 25577−  can be evaluated to high precision as in exercise 5.2.3–27. This special case was first analyzed by A. Gleason [unpublished, 1956] and H. Nagler [CACM 3  1960 , 618–620]. 14. Set D = B in exercise 13 to maximize C. [A detailed analysis of Algorithm L has been carried out by W. Panny and H. Prodinger, Algorithmica 14  1995 , 340–354.] 15. Make extra copies of steps L3, L4, L6 for the cases that Ls is known to equal p or q. [A further improvement can also be made, removing the assignment s ← p  or s ← q  from the inner loop, by simply renaming the registers! For example, change lines 20 and 21 to ‘LD3 INPUT,1 L ’ and continue with p in rI3, s in rI1 and Ls known to equal p. With eighteen copies of the inner loop, corresponding to the different permutations of  p, q, s  with respect to  rI1, rI2, rI3 , and to different knowledge about Ls, we can cut the average running time to  8N lg N + O N  u.] 16.  The result will be slightly faster than Algorithm L; see exercise 5.2.3–28.  17. Consider the new record as a subfile of length 1. Repeatedly merge the smallest two subfiles if they have the same length.  The resulting sorting algorithm is essentially the same as Algorithm L, but the subfiles are merged at different relative times.  18. Yes, but it seems to be a complicated job. The first solution to be found used the following ingenious construction [Doklady Akad. Nauk SSSR 186  1969 , 1256– 1258]: Let n be ≈ √ N. Divide the file into m + 2 “zones” Z1 . . . Zm Zm+1 Zm+2, where Zm+2 contains N mod n records while each other zone contains exactly n records. Interchange the records of Zm+1 with the zone containing RM; the file now takes the form Z1 . . . Zm A, where each of the Z1 . . . Zm contains exactly n records in order and where A is an auxiliary area containing s records, for some s in the range n ≤ s < 2n. Find the zone with smallest leading element, and exchange that entire zone with Z1; if more than one zone has the smallest leading element, choose one that has the smallest   5.2.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  649  trailing element.  This takes O m + n  operations.  Then find the zone with the next smallest leading and trailing elements, and exchange it with Z2, etc. Finally in O m m + n   = O N  operations we will have rearranged the m zones so that their leading elements are in order. Furthermore, because of our original assumptions about the file, each of the keys in Z1 . . . Zm will now have fewer than n inversions.  We can merge Z1 with Z2, using the following trick: Interchange Z1 with the first n elements A′ of A; then merge Z2 with A′ in the usual way but exchanging elements with the elements of Z1Z2 as they are output. For example, if n = 3 and x1 < y1 < x2 < y2 < x3 < y3, we have  Initial contents: Exchange Z1: Exchange x1: Exchange y1: Exchange x2: Exchange y2: Exchange x3:  Zone 1  Zone 2  x1 x2 x3 a3 a1 a3 x1 x1 a3 x1 x1 x1  y2 y1 y2 y1 a2 y2 y1 a2 y2 y1 a2 y2 y1 x2 a2 y2 y1 x2 a2 y2 x3 y1 x2  y3 y3 y3 y3 y3 y3 y3  a2  Auxiliary a1 a3 x1 x2 x3 a1 x2 x3 a1 x2 x3 a1 a3 x3 a3 x3 a1 a1 a3 a2   The merge is always complete when the nth element of the auxiliary area has been exchanged; this method generally permutes the auxiliary records.   The trick above is used to merge Z1 with Z2, then Z2 with Z3, . . . , Zm−1 with Zm, requiring a total of O mn  = O N  operations. Since no element has more than n inversions, the Z1 . . . Zm portion of the file has been completely sorted.  For the final “cleanup,” we sort RN+1−2s . . . RN by insertion, in O s2  = O N  steps; this brings the s largest elements into area A. Then we merge R1 . . . RN−2s with RN+1−2s . . . RN−s, using the trick above with auxiliary storage area A  but interchanging the roles of right and left, less and greater, throughout . Finally, we sort RN+1−s . . . RN by insertion. Subsequent refinements are discussed by J. Katajainen, T. Pasanen, and J. Teuhola in Nordic J. Computing 3  1996 , 27–40. See answer 5.5–3 for the problem of stable merging in place. 19. We may number the input cars so that the final permutation has them in order, 1 2 . . . 2n; so this is essentially a sorting problem. First move the first 2n−1 cars through n − 1 stacks, putting them in decreasing order, and transfer them to the nth stack so that the smallest is on top. Then move the other 2n−1 cars through n − 1 stacks, putting them into increasing order and leaving them positioned just before the nth stack. Finally, merge the two sequences together in the obvious way. 20. For further information, see R. E. Tarjan, JACM 19  1972 , 341–346. 22. See Information Processing Letters 2  1973 , 127–128. 23. The merges can be represented by a binary tree that has all external nodes on levels ⌊lg N⌋ and ⌈lg N⌉. Therefore the maximum number of comparisons is the minimum external path length of a binary tree with N external nodes, Eq. 5.3.1– 34 , minus N − 1, since f m, n  = m + n− 1 gives the maximum and there are N − 1 merges.  See also Eq. 5.4.9– 1 .   General techniques for studying the asymptotic properties of such recurrences with the help of Mellin transforms have been presented by P. Flajolet and M. Golin in Acta Informatica 31  1994 , 673–696; in particular, they show that the average number of   650  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.4  comparisons is N lg N − θN + δ lg N N + O 1  and the variance is ≈ .345N, where δ is a continuous function of period 1 and average value 0, and  ∞  m=1  θ = 1  ln 2 − 1  2 + 1 ln 2  2   m + 1  m + 2  ln 2m + 1 2m  = 1.24815 20420 99653 84890 29565 64329 53240 16127+.  The total number of comparisons is well approximated by a normal distribution as N → ∞; see the complementary analyses by H.-K. Hwang and M. Cramer in Random Structures & Algorithms 8  1996 , 319–336; 11  1997 , 81–96.  SECTION 5.2.5 1. No, because radix sorting doesn’t work at all unless the distribution sorting is stable, after the first pass.  But the suggested distribution sort could be used in a most- significant-digit-first radix sorting method, generalizing radix exchange, as suggested in the last paragraph of the text.  2. It is “anti-stable,” just the opposite; elements with equal keys appear in reverse order, since the first pass goes through the records from RN to R1.  This proves to be convenient because of lines 28 and 20 of Program R, equating Λ with 0; but of course it is not necessary to make the first pass go backwards.  3. If pile 0 is not empty, BOTM[0] already points to the first element; if it is empty, we set P ← LOC BOTM[0]  and later make LINK P  point to the bottom of the first nonempty pile. 4. When there are an even number of passes remaining, take pile 0 first  top to bottom , followed by pile 1, . . . , pile  M − 1 ; the result will be in order with respect to the digits examined so far. When there are an odd number of passes remaining, take pile  M − 1  first, then pile  M − 2 , . . . , pile 0; the result will be in reverse order with respect to the digits examined so far.  This rule was apparently first published by E. H. Friend [JACM 3  1956 , 156, 165–166].  5. Change line 04 to ‘ENT3 7’, and change the R3SW and R5SW tables to:  R3SW  R5SW  KEY,1 1:1  KEY,1 2:2  KEY,1 3:3  KEY,1 4:4  KEY,1 5:5  INPUT,1 1:1  INPUT,1 2:2  INPUT,1 3:3  INPUT,1 LINK   repeat the previous line six more times   LD2 LD2 LD2 LD2 LD2 LD2 LD2 LD2 LD1 ... DEC1 1  The new running time is found by changing “3” to “8” everywhere; it amounts to  11p − 1 N + 16pM + 12p − 4E + 2, for p = 8. 6.  a  Consider placing an  N + 1 st element. The recurrence  pM N+1 k = k + 1  pMN k+1  + M − k  pMN k  M  M   5.2.5  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  651   n    b  The nth derivative satisfies g   n  M N+1  z  = is equivalent to the stated formula. MN z  +   1 − z  M g  1 − n M g  n+1  MN  z , by induction on n. Setting z = 1, we find MN 1  =  1 − n M N M n, since gM0 z  = zM. Hence mean gMN  =  1 − 1 M N M,  n  g var gMN  =  1 − 2 M N M M − 1  +  1 − 1 M N M −  1 − 1 M 2N M 2.  Notice that the generating function for E in Program R is gMN z p.  7. Let R = radix sort, RX = radix exchange. Some of the important similarities and differences: RX goes from most significant digit to least significant, while R goes the other way. Both methods sort by digit inspections, without making comparisons of keys. RX always has M = 2  but see exercise 1 . The running time for R is almost unvarying, while RX is sensitive to the distribution of the digits. In both cases the running time is O N log K , where K is the range of keys, but the constant of proportionality is higher for RX; on the other hand, when the keys are uniformly distributed in their leading digits, RX has an average running time of O N log N  regardless of the size of K. R requires link fields while RX runs in minimal space. The inner loop of R is more suited to pipeline computers. 8. On the final pass, the piles should be hooked together in another order; for example, if M = 256, pile  10000000 2 comes first, then pile  10000001 2, . . . , pile  11111111 2, pile  00000000 2, pile  00000001 2, . . . , pile  01111111 2. This change in hooking order can be done easily by modifying Algorithm H, or  in Table 1  by changing the storage allocation strategy, on the last pass. 9. We could first separate the negative keys from the positive keys, as in exercise 5.2.2–33; or we could change the keys to complement notation on the first pass. Alternatively, after the last pass we could separate the positive keys from the negative ones, reversing the order of the latter, although the method of exercise 5.2.2–33 no longer applies. 11. Without the first pass the method would still sort perfectly, because  by coinci- dence  503 already precedes 509. Without the first two passes, the number of inversions would be 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5. 12. After exchanging Rk with R[P] in step M4  exercise 5.2–12 , we can compare Kk to Kk−1. If Kk is less, we compare it to Kk−2, Kk−3, . . . , until finding Kk ≥ Kj. Then set  Rj+1, . . . , Rk−1, Rk  ←  Rk, Rj+1, . . . , Rk−1 , without changing the LINK fields. It is convenient to place an artificial key K0, which is ≤ all other keys, at the left of the file. 14. If the original permutation of the cards requires k readings, in the sense of exercise 5.1.3–20, and if we use m piles per pass, we must make at least ⌈logm k⌉ passes.  Consider going back from a sorted deck to the original one; the number of readings increases by at most a factor of m on each pass.  The given permutation requires 4 increasing readings, 10 decreasing readings; hence decreasing order requires 4 passes with two piles or 3 passes with three piles. Conversely, this optimum number of passes can be achieved: Number the cards from 0 to k − 1 according to which reading it belongs to, and use a radix sort  least significant digit first in radix m . [See Martin Gardner’s Sixth Book of Mathematical Games  San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1971 , 111–112.] 15. Let there be k readings and m piles. The order is reversed on each pass; if there are k readings in one order, the number of readings in the opposite order is n + 1− k. The minimum number of passes is either the smallest even number greater than or equal to logm k or the smallest odd number greater than or equal to logm n + 1 − k .  Going   652  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.2.5  backwards, there are at most m decreasing readings after one pass, m2 increasing readings after two passes, etc.  The example can be sorted into increasing order in min 2, 5  = 2 passes, into decreasing order in min 3, 4  = 3 passes, using only two piles. 16. Assume that each string is followed by a special null character that is less than any letter of the alphabet. Perform a left-to-right radix sort by starting with all strings linked together in a single block of data. Then for k = 1, 2, . . . , refine every block that contains more than one distinct string by splitting it into subblocks based on the kth letter of each string, meanwhile keeping the blocks sorted by their already-examined prefixes. When a block has only one item, or when its kth characters are all null  so that its keys are identical , we can arrange to avoid examining it again. [R. Paige and R. E. Tarjan, SICOMP 16  1987 , 973–989, §2.] This process is essentially that of constructing a trie as in Section 6.3. A simpler but slightly less efficient algorithm based on right-to-left radix sort was given for this problem by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms  Addison–Wesley, 1974 , 79–84. The methods of McIlroy, Bostic, and McIlroy, cited in the text, are faster yet in practice. 17. MacLaren’s method speeds up the second level, but it cannot be used at the top level because it does not compute the numbers Nk.  18. First we prove the hint: Let pk =   k+1  CN p2 N CN−1 CN−1  plus cN−1 so Tk = O bk c . And as N → ∞ we have cN−1  f x  dx be the probability that a key falls into bin k when there are CN bins. The time needed to distribute the rec- ords is O N , and the average number of inversions remaining after distribution is 1 k=0 pkB C, because 2 pk ≤ B CN. Now consider two levels of distribution, with cN top-level bins, and let bk = sup{f x   k cN ≤ x <  k + 1  cN}.

When an external node appears, we know all of the equality relations, since we have Ka1 ≤ Ka2 ≤ ··· ≤ Kan and an explicit comparison Kai : Kai+1 has been made for 1 ≤ i < n. M. Paterson observes that if the multiplicities of keys are  n1, . . . , nm , the number  of comparisons can be reduced to n lg n − nj lg nj + O n ; see SICOMP 5  1976 , 2.  This lower bound can almost be reached without substantial auxiliary memory by adapting heapsort to equal keys as suggested by Munro and Raman in Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 519  1991 , 473–480. 7. See Fig. A–1. The average number of comparisons is  2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 · 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2  16 = 2 3 4. 8. See Fig. A–2. The average number of comparisons is 3 56 81. 9. We need at least n − 1 comparisons to discover that all keys are equal, if they are. Conversely, n− 1 comparisons always suffice, since we can always deduce the final ordering after comparing K1 with all of the other keys. 10. Let f n  be the desired function, and let g n  be the minimum average number of comparisons needed to sort n+k elements when k > 0 and exactly k of the elements have 2 f n − 1  + known values  0 or 1 . Then f 0  = f 1  = g 0  = 0, g 1  = 1; f n  = 1 + 1 2 g n− 2 , g n  = 1 + min g n− 1 , 1 2 g n− 2 , 2 g n− 1  + 1 1 for n ≥ 2.  Thus the best strategy is to compare two unknown elements whenever possible.  It follows that f n  − g n  = 1 2 f n − 1  − g n − 1   for n ≥ 2, and g n  = 3 n + 1 2  2 g n− 2   = 1 + 1  2 g n− 1  + 1  3 1 −  − 1  2 n   for n ≥ 0.

O   m − 1  m n ; see Eq. 1.2.6– 53 . 12.  a  If there are no redundant comparisons, we can arbitrarily assign an order to keys that are actually equal, when they are first compared, since no order can be deduced from previously made comparisons.  b  Assume that the tree strongly sorts every sequence of zeros and ones; we shall prove that it strongly sorts every permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Suppose it doesn’t; then there is a permutation for which it claims that Ka1 ≤ Ka2 ≤ ··· ≤ Kan, whereas in fact Kai > Kai+1 for some i. Replace all elements < Kai by 0 and all elements ≥ Kai by 1; by assumption the method will now sort when we take the path that leads to Ka1 ≤ Ka2 ≤ ··· ≤ Kan, a contradiction. 13. If n is even, F  n − F  n−1  = 1+ F ⌊n 2⌋ − F ⌊n 2⌋−1  so we must prove that wk−1 < ⌊n 2⌋ ≤ wk; this is obvious since wk−1 = ⌊wk 2⌋. If n is odd, F  n −F  n−1  = G ⌈n 2⌉  − G ⌊n 2⌋ , so we must prove that tk−1 < ⌈n 2⌉ ≤ tk; this is obvious since tk−1 = ⌈wk 2⌉. 4 n⌉ −  w1 + ··· + wj  where wj < n ≤ 14.

No, since we are considering only the less efficient branch of the tree below each comparison. One of the more efficient branches might turn out to be harder to handle. 20. Let L be the maximum level on which an external node appears, and let l be If L ≥ l + 2, we can remove two nodes from level L and the minimum such level. place them below a node at level l; this decreases the external path length by l + 2L −  L − 1 + 2 l + 1   = L − l − 1 ≥ 1. Conversely, if L ≤ l + 1, let there be k external nodes on level l and N − k on level l + 1, where 0 < k ≤ N. By exercise 2.3.4.5–3, k2−l +  N − k 2−l−1 = 1; hence N + k = 2l+1. The inequalities 2l ≤ N < 2l+1 now show that l = ⌊lg N⌋; this defines k and yields the external path length  34 . 21. Let r x  be the root of x’s right subtree. All subtrees have minimum height if and only if ⌈lg t l x  ⌉ ≤ ⌈lg t x ⌉ − 1 and ⌈lg t r x  ⌉ ≤ ⌈lg t x ⌉ − 1 for all x. The first condition is equivalent to 2t l x   − t x  ≤ 2⌈lg t x ⌉ − t x , and the second condition is equivalent to t x  − 2t l x   ≤ 2⌈lg t x ⌉ − t x . 22. By exercise 20, the four conditions ⌊lg t l x  ⌋, ⌊lg t r x  ⌋ ≥ ⌊lg t x ⌋ − 1 and ⌈lg t l x  ⌉, ⌈lg t r x  ⌉ ≤ ⌈lg t x ⌉ − 1 are necessary and sufficient. Arguing as in exercise 21, we can prove them equivalent to the stated conditions. [Martin Sandelius, AMM 68  1961 , 133–134.] See exercise 33 for a generalization. 23. Multiple list insertion assumes that the keys are uniformly distributed in a known range, so it isn’t a “pure comparison” method satisfying the restrictions considered in this section. 24. First proceed as if sorting five elements, until after five comparisons we reach one of the configurations in  6 . In the first three cases, complete sorting the five elements in two more comparisons, then insert the sixth element f. In the other case, first compare f : b, insert f into the main chain, then insert c. [Picard, Théorie des Questionnaires, page 116.] 25. Since N = 7! = 5040 and q = 13, there would be 8192 − 5040 = 3152 external nodes on level 12 and 5040 − 3152 = 1888 on level 13. 26. ˇL. Kollár [Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 233  1986 , 449–457] has presented an excellent way to verify that the optimum method has an external path length of 62416. 27.  1 : 3  2 : 3  1 : 2  1 : 2  132  312  2 : 3  123  213  231  321   5.3.1  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  657  is the only way to recognize the two most frequent permutations with two comparisons, even though the first comparison produces a .27 .73 split! 28. Lun Kwan has constructed an 873-line program whose average running time is 38.925u. Its maximum running time is 43u; the latter appears to be optimal since it is the time for 7 compares, 7 tests, 6 loads, 5 stores. 29. We must make at least S n  comparisons, because it is impossible to know whether a permutation is even or odd unless we have made enough comparisons to determine it uniquely. For we can assume that enough comparisons have been made to narrow things down to two possibilities that depend on whether or not ai is less than aj, for some i and j; one of the two possibilities is even, the other is odd. [On the other hand there is an O n  algorithm for this problem, which simply counts the number of cycles and uses no comparisons at all; see exercise 5.2.2–2.] 30. Start with an optimal comparison tree of height S n ; repeatedly interchange i ↔ j in the right subtree of a node labeled i: j, from top to bottom. Interpreting the result as a comparison-exchange tree, every terminal node defines a unique permutation that can be sorted by at most n − 1 more comparison-exchanges  by exercise 5.2.2–2 .  [The idea of a comparison-exchange tree is due to T. N. Hibbard.]  31. At least 8 are required, since every tree of height 7 will produce the configuration   or its dual  in some branch after 4 steps, with a ̸= 1. This configuration cannot be sorted in 3 more comparison exchange operations. On the other hand the following tree achieves the desired bound  and perhaps also the minimum average number of comparison exchanges :  33. Simple operations applied to any tree of order x and resolution 1 can be applied to yield another whose weighted path length is no greater, where all external nodes lie on levels k and k−1 for some k, and at most one external node is noninteger. Furthermore, the noninteger external node lies on level k, if such a node is present. The weighted path length of any such tree has the stated value, so this must be minimal. Conversely, if  iv  and  v  hold in any real-valued search tree it is possible to show by induction that the weighted path length has the stated value, since there is a simple formula for  a  b  d  c  e  1 : 4  2 : 5  Symmetrical  4 : 5  Symmetrical  3 : 4  3 : 4  1 : 3  4 : 5  2 : 3  4 : 5  α  α  α  2 : 3  β  β  β  1 : 2  1 : 2  2 : 3  α =  2 : 3  1 : 2  3 : 4  β =  1 : 3  1 : 2  3 : 4  1 : 2  1 : 2   658  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.1  the weighted path length of a tree in terms of the weighted path lengths of the two subtrees of the root. 36.

ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  659  11. Let n = gt as in the hint. We may assume that t ≥ 6. Without loss of generality let A2 : Bj be the first comparison. If j > gt−1, the outcome A2 < Bj will require ≥ t more steps. If j ≤ gt−1, the outcome A2 < Bj would be no problem, so only the case A2 > Bj needs study, and we get the most information when j = gt−1. If t = 2k + 1, we might have to merge A2 with the gt − gt−1 = 2k−1 elements > Bgt−1, and merge A1 with the gt−1 others, but this requires k +  k + 1  = t further steps. On the other hand if n = gt − 1, we could merge A2 with 2k−1 − 1 elements, then A1 with n elements, in  k − 1  +  k + 1  further steps, hence M 2, gt−1  ≤ t. The case t = 2k is considerably more difficult; note that gt − gt−1 ≥ 2k−2. After A2 > Bgt−1, suppose we compare A1 : Bj. If j > 2k−1 the outcome A1 < Bj requires k +  k − 1  further comparisons  too many . If j ≤ 2k−1, we can argue as before that j = 2k−1 gives most information. After A1 > B2k−1, the next comparisons with A1 might as well be with B2k−1+2k−2, then B2k−1+2k−2+2k−3; since 2k−1 + 2k−2 + 2k−3 > gt−1, the remaining problem is to merge {A1, A2} with n −  2k−1 + 2k−2 + 2k−3  elements. Of course we needn’t make any comparisons with A1 right away; we could instead compare A2 : Bn+1−j. If j ≤ 2k−3, we consider the case A2 < Bn+1−j, while if j > 2k−3 we consider A2 > Bn+1−j. The latter case requires at least  k − 2  +  k + 1  more steps. Continuing, we find that the only potentially fruitful line is A2 > Bgt−1, A2   B2k−1, A1 > B2k−1+2k−2, A1 > B2k−1+2k−2+2k−3, but then we have exactly gt−5 elements left! Conversely, if n = gt − 1, this line works. [Acta Informatica 1  1971 , 145–158.] 12. The first comparison must be either α: Xk for 1 ≤ k ≤ i, or  symmetrically  β : Xn−k for 1 ≤ k ≤ j. In the former case the response α < Xk leaves us with Rn k−1, j  more comparisons to make; the response α > Xk leaves us with the problem of sorting α   Yn−k−j, where Yr = Xr−k. 13.

Michael Tanner [SICOMP 7  1978 , 18–38] has shown that a “fractile insertion”   comparisons on the average. ˇL. Kollár [Com-  algorithm makes at most 1.06 lgm+n  puters and Artificial Intelligence 5  1986 , 335–344] has studied the average behavior of Algorithm H. 23. The adversary keeps an n× n matrix X whose entries xij are initially all 1. When the algorithm asks if Ai = Bj, the adversary sets xij to 0. The answer is “No,” unless the permanent of X has just become zero. In the latter case, the adversary answers “Yes”  as it must, lest the algorithm terminate immediately! , and deletes row i and column j from X; the resulting  n−1 × n−1  matrix will have a nonzero permanent. The adversary continues in this way until only a 0 × 0 matrix is left.  If the permanent is about to become zero, we can rearrange rows and columns so that i = j = 1 and the matrix has all 1s on the diagonal, yet its permanent vanishes when x11 ← 0; then we must have x1kxk1 = 0 for all k > 1. It follows that at least n zeros are deleted when the adversary first answers “Yes,” and n − 1 the second time, etc. The algorithm will terminate only after receiving n “Yes” answers to nonredundant questions, and after asking at least n +  n − 1  + ··· + 1 questions [JACM 19  1972 , 649–659]. A similar argument shows that n +  n − 1  + ··· +  n − m + 1  questions are needed to determine that A ⊆ B when A = m ≤ n = B. 24. The coarse preliminary merge needs at most m + q − 1 comparisons, and the subsequent insertions need at most t each. These upper bounds cannot be decreased. So the maximum is the same as for Algorithm H  see  19  . 25. The general problem is as hard as the special case where each xij is 0 or 1 and x = 1 2. Then each comparison is equivalent to looking at the bit xij, and we want to determine the entire matrix by inspecting the fewest bits. Any merging problem  1  corresponds to such a 0–1 matrix if we set xij = [Ai > Bn+1−j ].  N. Linial and M. Saks, in J. Algorithms 6  1985 , 86–103, attribute this observation to J. Shearer. A similar result connects searching and sorting with respect to any partial order.   SECTION 5.3.3 1. Player 11 lost to 05; so 13 was known to be worse than 05, 11, and 12. 2. Let x be the tth largest, and let S be the set of all elements y such that the comparisons made are insufficient to prove either that x < y or y < x. There are permutations, consistent with all the comparisons made, in which all elements of S are less than x; for we can stipulate that all elements of S are less than x and   5.3.3  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  661  embed the resulting partial ordering in a linear ordering. Similarly there are consistent permutations in which all elements of S are greater than x. Hence we don’t know the rank of x unless S is empty. 3. An adversary may regard the loser of the first comparison as the worst player of all. 4. Suppose the largest t−1 elements are {a1, . . . , at−1}. Any path in the comparison tree to determine the largest t elements, consistent with this assumption, must include at least n− t comparisons to determine the largest of the remaining n− t + 1 elements. Such paths have at least n − t binary choice points, so there are at least 2n−t of them. Thus, each of the nt−1 choices for the largest t − 1 elements must appear in at least 2n−t leaves of the tree. 5. In fact, Wt n  ≤ Vt n  + S t − 1 , by exercise 2. 6. Let g l1, l2, . . . , lm  = m − 2 + ⌈lg 2l1 + 2l2 + ··· + 2lm ⌉, and assume that f = g whenever l1 + l2 + ··· + lm + 2m < N. We shall prove that f = g when l1 + l2 + ··· + lm + 2m = N. We may assume that l1 ≥ l2 ≥ ··· ≥ lm. There are only a few possible ways to make the first comparison: Strategy A j, k , for j < k. Compare the largest element of group j with the largest of group k. This gives the relation  f l1, . . . , lm  ≤ 1 + g l1, . . . , lj−1, lj+1, lj+1, . . . , lk−1, lk+1, . . . , lm   = g l1, . . . , lj−1, lj, lj+1, . . . , lk−1, lj, lk+1, . . . , lm  ≥ g l1, . . . , lm .  Strategy B j, k , for lk > 0. Compare the largest element of group j with one of the small elements of group k. This gives the relation  f l1, . . . , lm  ≤ 1 + max α, β  = 1 + β,  where  α = g l1, . . . , lj−1, lj+1, . . . , lm  ≤ g l1, . . . , lm  − 1, β = g l1, . . . , lk−1, lk−1, lk+1, . . . , lm  ≥ g l1, . . . , lm  − 1.  Strategy C j, k , for j ≤ k, lj > 0, lk > 0. Compare a small element from group j with a small element from group k. The corresponding relation is  f l1, . . . , lm  ≤ 1 + g l1, . . . , lk−1, lk − 1, lk+1, . . . , lm  ≥ g l1, . . . , lm .  The value of f l1, . . . , lm  is found by taking the minimum right-hand side over all these strategies; hence f l1, . . . , lm  ≥ g l1, . . . , lm . When m > 1, Strategy A m−1, m  shows that f l1, . . . , lm  ≤ g l1, . . . , lm , since g l1, . . . , lm−1, lm  = g l1, . . . , lm−1, lm−1  when l1 ≥ ··· ≥ lm.  Proof: ⌈lg M + 2a ⌉ = ⌈lg M + 2b ⌉ for 0 ≤ a ≤ b, when M is a positive multiple of 2b.  When m = 1, use Strategy C 1, 1 . [S. S. Kislitsyn’s paper determined the optimum strategy A m−1, m  and eval- uated f l, l, . . . , l  in closed form; the general formula for f and this simplified proof were discovered by Floyd in 1970.] 7. For j > 1, if j + 1 is in α′, cj is 1 plus the number of comparisons needed to select the next largest element of α′. Similar reasoning applies if j + 1 is in α′′; and c1 is always 0, since the tree always looks the same at the end. 8. In other words, is there an extended binary tree with n external nodes such that the sum of the distances to the t − 1 farthest internal nodes from the root is less than the corresponding sum for the complete binary tree? The answer is no, since it is not hard to show that the kth largest element of µ α  is at least ⌊lg n − k ⌋ for all α.   662  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.3  9.  All paths use six comparisons, yet the procedure is not optimum for V 3 5 .   10.  Found manually by trial and error, using exercise 6 to help find fruitful lines.   12.

After finding the median of the first f n  elements, say Xj, compare it to each of the others; this splits the elements into approximately n 2− k less than Xj and n 2+ k greater than Xj, for some k. It remains to find the kth largest or smallest element of the bigger set, which requires n 2+O k log n  further comparisons. The average value of k  consider points uniformly distributed in [0 . . 1]  is O 1  Let T  n  be the average number of comparisons when f n  = n2 3; then T  n  − n = T  n2 3  − n2 3 + n 2 + O n2 3 , and the result follows.  n   + O n f n   .  It is interesting to note that when n = 5, this method requires only 5 13  15 compar- isons on the average, slightly better than the tree of exercise 9. 14. In general, the t largest can be found in Ut n  ≤ Vt n − 1  + 1 comparisons, by finding the tth largest of {X1, . . . , Xn−1} and comparing it with Xn, because of exercise 2.  Kirkpatrick actually proved that  12  is a lower bound for Ut n + 1  − 1. For larger t, an improved bound for Ut n  was found by J. W. John, SICOMP 17  1988 , 640–647.  15. min t, n+1−t . Assuming that t ≤ n + 1 − t, if we don’t save each of the first t words when they are first read in, we may have forgotten the tth largest, depending on the subsequent values still unknown to us. Conversely, t locations are sufficient, since we can compare a newly input item with the previous tth largest, storing the register if and only if it is greater. 16. The algorithm starts with  a, b, c, d  =  n, 0, 0, 0  and ends with  0, 1, 1, n−2 . If the adversary avoids “surprising” outcomes, the only transitions possible after each comparison are from  a, b, c, d  to itself or to   a−2, b+1, c+1, d ,  a−1, b, c+1, d  or  a−1, b+1, c, d ,  a, b−1, c, d+1 ,  a, b, c−1, d+1 ,  if a ≥ 2; if a ≥ 1; if b ≥ 2; if c ≥ 2.  2 a⌉ + b + c − 2 comparisons are needed to get from  a, b, c, d  to It follows that ⌈ 3  0, 1, 1, a+b+c+d−2 . [Reference: CACM 15  1972 , 462–464. In FOCS 16  1975 , 71– 74, Pohl proved that the algorithm also minimizes the average number of comparisons.] 17. Use  6  first for the largest, then for the smallest, noting that ⌊n 2⌋ of the comparisons are common to both. 18. Vt n  ≤ 18n − 151, for all sufficiently large n. 21. Step 0. Build two knockout trees of sizes 2k and 2k−t+1. Step j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ t.  At this point we have output the largest j−1 elements. The remaining elements, together with a set of dummy placeholders that each equal −∞, now appear in two knockout trees A and B, where A has 2k leaves and B has 2k−t+j.  Let a be the champion of A, and assume that a has beaten a0, a1, . . . , ak−1, where al is a champion of 2l elements. Similarly, let b and b0, b1, . . . , bk−t+j−1 be the champion and subchampions of B. If j = t, output max a, b  and stop. Otherwise, “grow” another level at the bottom of B by introducing 2k−t+j dummies who each have lost their first game to the players of B.  Our strategy will be to merge B into A, if possible, by exchanging it with the subtree A′ of A that contains a0, a1, . . . , ak−t+j; notice that A′, like the newly enlarged B, is a knockout tree with 2k−t+j+1 leaves.  Compare b to ak−t+j+1, then compare the winner to ak−t+j+2, etc., until c = max b, ak−t+j−1, . . . , ak−1  has been found. Case 1, b < c: Output a and interchange   664  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.3  B with A′. Case 2, b = c and b < a: Output a and interchange B with A′. Case 3, b = c and b > a: Output b. After handling these three cases we are left with  possibly new  knockout trees A and B in which the champion of B has just been output. Remove that element from B and replace it by −∞, making any necessary comparisons to restore the knockout tournament structure  as in tree selection . This completes Step j. Step 0 makes 2k − 1 + 2k+1−t − 1 comparisons, and Step t makes 1. Steps 1, 2, . . . , t − 1 each make at most k − 1 comparisons, except in Case 2 when there might be k. But whenever Case 2 occurs, we’ll save one comparison the next time we’re in Case 1 or Case 2, because a0 will then be −∞. Thus the first t− 1 steps make at most  t − 1  k − 1  + 1 comparisons altogether. By exercise 3 we have Wt n  ≤ n +  t − 1  k − 1  for all n ≤ 2k + 2k+1−t, when k ≥ t ≥ 2. If n ≥ 2k+t−2, exercise 4 says that Wt n  ≥ n−t+⌈lg 2k+t−2 t−1⌉, which is n−t+ t−1 k+1 if t ≥ 3. Thus the method is optimum for 2k+t−2 ≤ n ≤ 2k+2k+1−t when k ≥ t ≥ 3.  Also for several smaller values of n, if t is large.  A similar method, which uses a reserved element instead of −∞ when rebuilding B at the end of steps 1, . . . , t−2  see the proof of  11  , proves that Vt n  ≤ n+ t−1  k−1  when n ≤ 2k + 2k+1−t + t − 2 and k ≥ t ≥ 3. [See J. Algorithms 5  1984 , 557–578.] 22. In general when 2r · 2k < n + 2 − t ≤  2r + 1  · 2k and t < 2r ≤ 2t, this procedure starting with t + 1 knockout trees of size 2k will yield ⌊ t − 1  2⌋ fewer comparisons than  11 , since at least this many of the comparisons that were used to find the minimum in  ii  can be “reused” in  iii .  n  n is bounded below by 2 as n → ∞. 23. According to  15 , the quantity V⌈n 2⌉ But D. Dor and U.

Since Wt n  = n + O t log n  by Eq.  6 , the statement in the hint is surely true when t ≤ √ n  ln n. Suppose that statement holds for n, and let u and v have ranks √ t− = ⌊t−√ t ln n⌉ in the first n of 2n randomly ordered elements. t ln n⌋ and t+ = ⌈t+ .

Let u and v have ranks s− and s+ among all to u is  n n+1 t; this is the average number of elements < x, hence the average number of comparisons 2n elements, and let T− = ⌊2t − √ √ 2t ln 2n⌉. If s− ≤ T− and s+ ≥ T+, we can find the elements of ranks T− and T+ by selecting from the s+−s− +1 elements between u and v. We will prove that it’s very unlikely to have s− > T− or s− < T− − 2 n ln n; therefore O n log n 1 2 further comparisons will almost always suffice. The hint will follow by induction on n if we can show that “very unlikely” means “with probability O n−1−ϵ  for all sufficiently large n.” Notice that ps+1 ps = s n − s + t   s + 1 − t  2n − s  decreases as s increases it is ≤ 1 − from t to n + t, and it is ≤ 1 if and only if s ≥ 2n t − 1   n − 1 ; 2 cn−1 2 + O n−1  when s = s c  = 2t + ct n − t  n3 2.

Let Bk π  = [the first charge to both t + k and t − k was 1  Thus the probability O n−1.2 log n 1 2  is indeed very unlikely. [A similar construction appeared in CACM 18  1975 , 165–172, but the analysis was incorrect.] 25. Given a selection algorithm and a permutation π of {1, . . . , n}, let’s charge each comparison πi : πj to πi if πi − t > πj − t; if πi − t = πj − t, we charge 1 2 to each. A charge to πi is called useful if πi   πj ≥ t; otherwise it’s useless. Let xk be the total charge to k. Then the total number of comparisons is x1 + ··· + xn. Clearly xt = 0; but xk ≥ 1 for all k ̸= t, because every element other than t has a useful charge. We will prove that E xt+k + E xt−k ≥ 3 for 0 < k < t. Let Ak π  = [the first charge to t + k was useless]. Then Ak π  = 1 − A−k π′ , where π′ is like π but with the elements  t− k, . . . , t+ k−1, t+ k  replaced respectively by  t−k+1, . . . , t+k, t−k . Therefore E Ak + E A−k = 1. 2, and t + k received its second charge before t − k did]. Also let Ck π  = [xt+k ≥ 2 + Ak]. Then Bk π  ≤ Ck π′ , where π′ is like π but with the elements  t− k, t− k + 1, . . . , t + k − 1  replaced by  t + k − 1, t − k, . . . , t + k − 2 . Similarly, B−k π  ≤ C−k π′′ , where π′′ is obtained from π by changing  t−k+1, . . . , t+k−1, t+k  to  t−k+2, . . . , t+k, t−k+1 . It follows that E Bk ≤ E Ck and E B−k ≤ E C−k. The proof is completed by observing that xt−k +xt+k ≥ 2+Ak +A−k−Bk−B−k + Ck + C−k. [See JACM 36  1989 , 270–279, for further results.] The upper bound in  17  also has a matching lower bound: Andrew and Frances Yao proved that V t n  ≥ n+ 1 2 t  ln ln n−ln t−9  for t > 1 and n ≥  8t 18t, in SICOMP 11  1982 , 428–447. 26.  a  Let the vertices of the two types of components be designated a; b < c. The adversary acts as follows on nonredundant comparisons: Case 1, a:a′, make an arbitrary decision. Case 2, x: b, say that x > b; all future comparisons y : b with this particular b will result in y > b, otherwise the comparisons are decided by an adversary for Ut n−1 , yielding ≥ 2 + Ut n − 1  comparisons in all. This reduction will be abbreviated “let b = min; 2 + Ut n − 1 .” Case 3, x: c, let c = max; 2 + Ut−1 n − 1 .  b  Let the new types of vertices be designated d1, d2   i.

Hence the number of 0s in the even subsequence minus the number of 0s in the odd subsequence is ±1 or 0. 11.  Solution by M. W. Green.  The network is symmetric in the sense that, whenever zi is compared to zj, there is a corresponding comparison of z2t−1−j : z2t−1−i. Any symmetric network capable of sorting a sequence ⟨z0, . . . , z2t−1⟩ will also sort the sequence ⟨−z2t−1, . . . ,−z0⟩. Batcher has observed that the network will actually sort any cyclic shift ⟨zj, zj+1, . . . , z2t−1, z0, . . . , zj−1⟩ of a bitonic sequence. This is a consequence of the 0–1 principle. [These results do not hold for bitonic sorters when the order is not a power of 2. For example, Fig. 52 does not sort ⟨0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0⟩. Batcher’s original definition of bitonic sequences was more complicated and less useful than the definition adopted here.] 12. x ∨ y is  consider 0–1 sequences , but not x ∧ y  consider ⟨3, 1, 4, 5⟩ ∧ ⟨6, 7, 8, 2⟩ . 13. A perfect shuffle has the effect of replacing zi by zj, where the binary representation of j is that of i rotated cyclically to the right one place  see exercise 3.4.2–13 . Consider shuffling the comparators instead of the lines; then the first column of comparators acts on the pairs z[i] and z[i ⊕ 2r−1], the next column on z[i] and z[i ⊕ 2r−2], . . . , the tth column on z[i] and z[i ⊕ 1], the  t + 1 st column on z[i] and z[i ⊕ 2r−1] again, etc. Here ⊕ denotes exclusive-or on the binary representation. This shows that Fig. 57 is equivalent to Fig. 56; after s stages we have groups of 2s elements that are alternatively sorted and reverse-sorted.  C. G. Plaxton and T. Suel [Math. Systems Theory 27  1994 , 491–508] have shown  that any such network requires at least Ω  log n 2 log log n  levels of delay. 14.  a  Let yis = xjs, yjs = xis, yk = xk for is ̸= k ̸= js; then yαs = xα.  b  This is obvious unless the set {is, js, it, jt} has only three distinct elements; suppose that is = it. Then if s < t the first s − 1 comparators have  is, js, jt  replaced, respectively, by  js, jt, is  in both  αs t and  αt s.  c   αs s = α, and α1 = α, so we can assume that s1 > s2 > ··· > sk > 1.  d  Let β = α[i: j]; then gβ x1, . . . , xn  =  ¯xi ∨ xj  ∧  gα x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xj, . . . , xn  ∨ gα x1, . . . , xj, . . . , xi, . . . , xn  . Iterating this identity yields the result.  e  fα x  = 1 if and only if no path in Gα goes from i to j where xi > xj. If α is a sorting network, the conjugates of α are also; and fα x  = 0 for all x with xi > xi+1. Take x = e i ; this shows that G has an arc from i to k1 for some k1 ̸= i. If k1 ̸= i+1, x = e i ∨ e k1  shows that G has an arc from i or k1 to k2 for some k2  ∈ {i, k1}. If k2 ̸= i + 1, continue in the same way until finding a path in G from i to i + 1. Conversely if α is not a sorting network, let x be a vector with xi > xi+1 and gα x  = 1. Some conjugate α′ has fα′ x  = 1, so Gα′ can have no path from i to i + 1. [In general,  xα i ≤  xα j for all x if and only if Gα′ has an oriented path from i to j for all α′ conjugate to α.] 15. [1:4][3:2][1:3][2:4][2:3]. 16. The process clearly terminates. Each execution of step T2 has the effect of interchanging the iqth and jqth outputs, so the result of the algorithm is to permute the output lines in some way. Since the resulting  standard  network makes no change to the input ⟨1, 2, . . . , n⟩, the output lines must have been returned to their original position. 17. Make the network standard by the algorithm of exercise 16; then by considering the input sequence ⟨1, 2, . . . , n⟩, we see that standard selection networks must take the   668  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.4  t largest elements into the t highest-numbered lines; and a ˆVt n  network must take the tth largest into line n + 1 − t. Apply the zero-one principle. 18. The proof in Theorem A shows that ˆVt n  ≥  n − t ⌈lg t + 1 ⌉ + ⌈lg t⌉. 19. The network [1: n][2: n] . . . [1:3][2:3] selects the smallest two elements with 2n − 4 comparators; add [1:2] for ˆV2 n . The lower bounds come from the proof of Theorem A  see the previous answer . 20.  a  First note that ˆV3 n  ≥ ˆV3 n − 1  + 2 when n ≥ 4: By symmetry the first comparator may be assumed to be [1: n]; after this must come a network to select the third largest of ⟨x2, x3, . . . , xn⟩, and an- other comparator touching line 1. On the other hand, ˆV3 5  ≤ 7, since four comparators find the min and max of {x1, x2, x3, x4}, then we sort the other three.  b  A subtle construction by M. W. Green, shown  for n = 11, does the job.  Equality probably holds.  21. False; consider, for example, the two networks [1:2][3:4][2:3][1:4][1:2][3:4] and [1:2][3:4][2:3][3:4][1:4][1:2][3:4].  However, N. G. de Bruijn proved in Discrete Math. 9  1974 , 337, that new comparators do not mess up sorting networks that are primitive in the sense of exercise 36.  22.  a  By induction on the length of α, since xi ≤ yi and xj ≤ yj implies that xi ∧ xj ≤ yi ∧ yj and xi ∨ xj ≤ yi ∨ yj.  b  By induction on the length of α, since  xi∧xj  yi∧yj + xi∨xj  yi ∨ yj  ≥ xiyi + xjyj. [Consequently ν x∧y  ≤ ν xα∧yα , an observation due to W. Shockley.] 23. Let xk = 1 if and only if pk ≥ j, yk = 1 if and only if pk > j; then  xα k = 1 if and only if  pα k ≥ j, etc. 24. The formula for l′i is obvious and for l′j take z = x ∧ y as in the hint and observe that  zα i =  zα j = 0 by exercise 21. Adding additional 1s to z shows the existence of a permutation p with  pα′ j ≤ ζ z , by exercise 23. The relations for u′i and u′j follow by reversing the order. 25.  Solution by H. Shapiro.  Let p and q be permutations with  pα k = lk and  qα k = uk. We can transform p into q by repeatedly interchanging pairs  i, i + 1  of adjacent integers; such an interchange in the input affects the kth output by at most ±1. 26. There is a one-to-one correspondence that takes the element ⟨p1, . . . , pn⟩ of Pnα into the “covering sequence” x 0  covers x 1  covers . . . covers x n , where the x i  are in Dnα; in this correspondence, x i−1  = x i  ∨ e j  if and only if pj = i. For example, ⟨3, 1, 4, 2⟩ corresponds to the sequence ⟨1, 1, 1, 1⟩ covers ⟨1, 0, 1, 1⟩ covers ⟨1, 0, 1, 0⟩ covers ⟨0, 0, 1, 0⟩ covers ⟨0, 0, 0, 0⟩. [Andrew Yao observes that consequently it suffices any 4-network that sorts ⟨4, 1, 2, 3⟩, ⟨3, 1, 4, 2⟩, ⟨3, 4, 1, 2⟩, ⟨2, 4, 1, 3⟩, and ⟨2, 3, 4, 1⟩ sorts everything. See exercise 6.5–1; see also exercise 56.] 27. The principle holds because  xα i is the ith smallest element of x. If x and y denote different columns of a matrix whose rows are sorted, so that xi ≤ yi for all i, and if xα and yα denote the result of sorting the columns, the stated principle shows that  xα i ≤  yα i for all i, since we can choose i elements of x in the same rows as any i given elements of y. [We have used this principle to prove the invariance property of shellsort, Theorem 5.2.1K. Further exploitation of the idea appears in an interesting paper by David Gale and R. M. Karp, J.

The fact that column sorting does not mess up sorted rows was apparently first observed in connection with the manipulation of tableaux; see Hermann Boerner, Darstellung von Gruppen  Springer, 1955 , Chapter V, §5.] 28. If {xi1 , . . . , xit} are the t largest elements, then xi1 ∧ . . . ∧ xit is the tth largest. If {xi1 , . . . , xit} are not the t largest, then xi1 ∧ . . . ∧ xit is less than the tth largest. 29. ⟨x1 ∧ y1,  x2 ∧ y1  ∨  x1 ∧ y2 ,  x3 ∧ y1  ∨  x2 ∧ y2  ∨  x1 ∧ y3 , y1 ∨  x3 ∧ y2  ∨  x2 ∧ y3 ∨  x1 ∧ y4 , y2 ∨  x3 ∧ y3 ∨  x2 ∧ y4 ∨  x1 ∧ y5 , y3 ∨  x3 ∧ y4 ∨  x2 ∧ y5 ∨ x1, y4 ∨  x3 ∧ y5  ∨ x2, y5 ∨ x3⟩. 30. Applying the distributive and associative laws reduces any formula to ∨’s of ∧’s; then the commutative, idempotent, and absorption laws lead to canonical form. The Si are precisely those sets S such that the formula is 1 when xj = [j ∈ S] while the formula is 0 when xj = [j ∈ S′] for any proper subset S′ of S. 31. δ4 = 166. R. Church [Duke Math. J. 6  1940 , 732–734] found δ5 = 7579, M. Ward [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 52  1946 , 423] found δ6 = 7828352, and the next values are δ7 = 2414682040996, δ8 = 56130437228687557907786 [R.

Sapozhenko, with a similar formula for δ2m+1; see Russian Math. Surveys 58  2003 , 929–1001, Theorem 1.8. 32. Gt+1 is also the set of all strings θψ where θ and ψ are in Gt and θ ⊆ ψ as vectors of 0s and 1s. It follows that Gt is the set of all strings z0 . . . z2t−1 of 0s and 1s having the property that zi ≤ zj whenever the binary representation of i is “⊆” the binary representation of j in the 0–1 vector sense. Each element z0 . . . z2t−1 of Gt, except 00 . . . 0 and 11 . . . 1, represents a ∧–∨ function f x1, . . . , xt  from D2t into {0, 1}, under the correspondence f x1, . . . , xt  = z x1...xt 2. 33. If such a network existed we would have  x1 ∧ x2  ∨  x2 ∧ x3  ∨  x3 ∧ x4  = f x1 ∧ x2, x1 ∨ x2, x3, x4  or f x1 ∧ x3, x2, x1 ∨ x3, x4  or . . . or f x1, x2, x3 ∧ x4, x3 ∨ x4  for some function f. The choices ⟨x1, x2, x3, x4⟩ = ⟨x, ¯x, 1, 0⟩, ⟨x, 0, ¯x, 1⟩, ⟨x, 1, 0, ¯x⟩, ⟨1, x, ¯x, 0⟩, ⟨1, x, 0, ¯x⟩, ⟨0, 1, x, ¯x⟩ show that no such f exists. 34. Yes; after proving this, you are ready to tackle the network for n = 16 in Fig. 49  unless you simply checked all 2n bit vectors by brute force using Theorem Z . 35. Otherwise the permutation in which only i and i+1 are misplaced would never be sorted. Let Dk be the number of comparators [i: i+k] in a standard sorting network. Then D1 + 2D2 + D3 ≥ 2 n − 2  since there must be two comparators from {i, i+1} to {i+2, i+3}, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 3, as well as [1:2] and [n−1: n]. Similarly D1 + 2D2 +··· + kDk + k−1 Dk+1 +···+ D2k−1 ≥ k n− k , a formula suggested by J. M. Pollard. We can also prove that 2D1+D2 ≥ 3n−4: If we strike out the first comparators of the form [j : j+1] for all j there must be at least one more comparator lying within {i, i+1, i+2}, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2. Similarly kD1 +  k − 1 D2 + ··· + Dk ≥ S k + 1  n − k  + k k − 1 .  inversions.  b  Let α = β[p: p+1], and argue by induction on ⟨n, n−1, . . . , 1⟩ has n 36.  a  Each adjacent comparator reduces the number of inversions by 0 or 1, and  the length of α. If p = i, then j > p + 1, and  xβ p >  xβ j,  xβ p+1 >  xβ j; hence If p = i − 1, then either  xβ p or  xβ p+1 is  yβ p >  yβ j and  yβ p+1 >  yβ j. >  xβ j; hence either  yβ p or  yβ p+1 is >  yβ j. If p = j − 1 or j, the arguments are similar. For other p the argument is trivial.  2   670  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.4  Notes: If α is a primitive sorting network, so is αR  the comparators in reverse order . For generalizations and another proof of  c , see N. G. de Bruijn, Discrete Mathematics 9  1974 , 333–339; Indagationes Math. 45  1983 , 125–132. In the latter paper, de Bruijn proved that a primitive network sorts all permutations of the multiset {n1 · 1, . . . , nm · m} if and only if it sorts the single permutation mcm . . . 1c1. The relation x ⪯ y, defined for permutations x and y to mean that there exists a standard network α such that x = yα, is called Bruhat order; the analogous relation restricted to primitive α is weak Bruhat order  see the answer to exercise 5.2.1–44 . 37. It suffices to show that if each comparator is replaced by an interchange operation we obtain a “reflection network” that transforms ⟨x1, . . . , xn⟩ into ⟨xn, . . . , x1⟩. But in this interpretation it is not difficult to trace the route of xk. Note that the per- mutation π =  1 2  3 4  . . .  2n−1 2n  2 3  4 5  . . .  2n−2 2n−1  =  1 3 5 . . . 2n−1 2n 2n−2 . . . 2  satisfies πn =  1 2n  2 2n−1  . . .  n−1 n . The odd-even transposition sort was mentioned briefly by H. Seward in 1954; it has been discussed by A. Grasselli [IRE Trans. EC-11  1962 , 483] and by Kautz, Levitt, and Waksman [IEEE Trans. C-17  1968 , 443–451]. The reflective property of this network was introduced much earlier by H. E. Dudeney in one of his “frog puzzles” [Strand 46  1913 , 352, 472; Amusements in Mathematics  1917 , 193]. 38. Insert the elements i1, . . . , iN into an initially empty tableau using Algorithm 5.1.4I but with one crucial change: Set Pij ← xi in step I3 only if xi ̸= Pi j−1 . It can be proved that xi will equal Pi j−1  in that step only if xi + 1 = Pij, when the inputs i1 . . . iN define a primitive sorting network.  The parenthesized assertions of the algorithm need to be modified.  After ij has been inserted into P , set Qst ← j as in Theorem 5.1.4A. After N steps, the tableau P will always contain  r, r+1, . . . , n−1  in row r, while Q will be a tableau from which the sequence i1 . . . iN can be reconstructed by working backwards.  For example, when n = 6 the sequence i1 . . . iN = 4 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 3 1 2 3 5 1 4 corre-  sponds to  P =  ,  Q =  1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 4 5 5  1 4 5 8 13 2 6 7 15 3 9 12 10 11 14  .  The transpose of Q corresponds to the complementary network [n−i1 : n−i1+1] . . . [n−iN : n−iN+1].  References: A. Lascoux and M. P. Schützenberger, Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci.

The diagrams of primitive sorting networks also correspond to arrangements of pseudolines and to other abstractions of two-dimensional convexity; see D. E. Knuth, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 606  1992 , for further information. 39. When n = 8, for example, such a network must include the comparators shown here; all other comparators are ineffective on 10101010. Then lines ⌈n 3⌉ . .⌈2n 3⌉ = 3 . . 6 sort 4 elements, as in exercise 37.  This exercise is based on an idea of David B. Wilson.   Notes: There is a one-to-one correspondence between minimal-length primitive networks that sort a given bit string and Young tableaux whose   5.3.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  671  2  2  shape is bounded by the zigzag path defined by that bit string. Thus, exercise 38  yields a one-to-one correspondence between primitive networks ofn 2+1 that sort  10 n 2 and primitive networks of n 2+1   comparators  comparators that sort n 2 + 1  arbitrary numbers. If a primitive network sorts the bit string 1n 20n 2, we can make a stronger statement: All of its “halves,” consisting of the subnetworks on lines k through k + n 2 inclusive, are sorting networks, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n 2.  See also de Bruijn’s theorem, cited in the answer to exercise 36.  40. This follows by applying the tail inequalities to the interesting construction in Proposition 7 of a paper by H. Rost, Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und verwandte Gebiete 58  1981 , 41–53, setting b = 1  Experiments show that the expected time to reach any primitive sorting network — not necessarily the bubble sort — is very nearly 2n2. Curiously, R. P. Stanley and S. V. Fomin have proved that if the comparators [ik :ik+1] are chosen nonuniformly in such a  , the corresponding expected time comes  way that ik = j occurs with probability j n to exactlyn  4, and t = 4n +  2, a = 1  n ln n.  √  2  H n  2 .  2  42. There must exist a path of length ⌈lg n⌉ or more, from some input to the largest output  consider mn in Theorem A . When that input is set to ∞, the comparators on this path have a predetermined behavior, and the remaining network must be an  n − 1 -sorter. [IEEE Trans. C-21  1972 , 612–613.] 45. After l levels the input x1 can be in at most 2l different places. After merging is complete, x1 can be in n + 1 different places. 46. [J. Algorithms 3  1982 , 79–88; the following alternative proof is due to V. S. Grinberg.] We may assume that 1 ≤ m ≤ n and that every stage makes m comparisons. Let l = ⌈ n−m  2⌉ and suppose we are merging x1 ≤ ··· ≤ xm with y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn. An adversary can force ⌈lg m+n ⌉ stages as follows: In the first stage some xj is compared to an element yk where we have either k ≤ l or k ≥ l + m. The adversary decides that xj−1   yn; also that xj > yk if k ≤ l, xj < yk if k ≥ l+m. The remaining task is essentially to merge xj with either yk+1 ≤ ··· ≤ yn and k ≤ l or y1 ≤ ··· ≤ yk−1 and k ≥ l + m; so at least min n−l+1, l+m  = ⌈ m + n  2⌉ outcomes remain. At least ⌈lg⌈ m + n  2⌉⌉ = ⌈lg m + n ⌉ − 1 subsequent stages are therefore necessary. 48. Let u be the smallest element of  xα j, and let y 0  be any vector in Dn such that  y 0  k = 0 implies  xα k contains an element ≤ u,  y 0  k = 1 implies  xα k contains an element > u. If α = β[p: q], it is possible to find a vector y 1  satisfying the same conditions but with α replaced by β, and such that y 1 [p: q] = y 0 . Starting with  y 0  i = 1,  y 0  j = 0, we eventually reach y = y r  satisfying the desired condition. G. Baudet and D. Stevenson have observed that exercises 37 and 48 combine to yield a simple sorting method with  n ln n  k+O n  comparison cycles on k processors: First sort k subfiles of size ≤ ⌈n k⌉, then merge them in k passes using the “odd-even transposition merge” of order k. [IEEE Trans. C-27  1978 , 84–87.] 49. Both  x ∨∨ y  ∨∨ z and x ∨∨  y ∨∨ z  represent the largest m elements of the multiset x ⊎ y ⊎ z;  x ∧∧ y  ∧∧ z and x ∧∧  y ∧∧ z  represent the smallest m. If x = y = z = {0, 1},  x ∧∧ z  ∨∨  y ∧∧ z  =  x ∧∧ y  ∨∨  x ∧∧ z  ∨∨  y ∧∧ z  = {0, 0}, but the middle elements of {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1} are {0, 1}. Sorting networks for three elements and the result of exercise 48 imply that the middle elements of x ⊎ y ⊎ z may be expressed either as   x ∨∨ y  ∧∧ z  ∨∨  x ∧∧ y  or   x ∧∧ y  ∨∨ z  ∧∧  x ∨∨ y  or any other formula obtained by permuting x, y, z in these expressions.  There seems to be no symmetrical formula for the middle elements.    672  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.3.4  50. Equivalently by Theorem Z, we must find all identities satisfied by the operations  x ∨∨ y = min x+y, 1 ,  x ∧∧ y = max 0, x+y−1   on rational values x, y in [0 . . 1]. [This is the operation of pouring as much liquid as possible from a glass that is x full into another that is y full, as observed by J. M. Pollard.] All such identities can be obtained from a system of four axioms and a rule of inference for multivalued logic due to Łukasiewicz; see Rose and Rosser, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 87  1958 , 1–53. 51. Let α′ = α[i: j], and let k be an index ̸= i, j. If  xα i ≤  xα k for all x, then  xα′ i ≤  xα′ k; if  xα k ≤  xα i and  xα k ≤  xα j for all x, the same holds when α is replaced by α′; if  xα k ≤  xα i for all x, then  xα′ k ≤  xα′ j. In this way we see that α′ has at least as many known relations as α, plus one more if [i: j] isn’t redundant. [Bell System Tech. J. 49  1970 , 1627–1644.] 52.  a  Consider sorting 0s and 1s; let w = x0 + x1 +···+ xN. The network fails if and only if w ≤ t and x0 = 1 before the complete N-sort. If x0 = 1 at this point, it must have been 1 initially, and for 1 ≤ j ≤ n we must have initially had either x2j−1+2nk = 1 for 0 ≤ k ≤ m or x2j+2nk = 1 for 0 ≤ k ≤ m; therefore w ≥ 1+ m+1 n = t. So failure implies that w = t and xj = xj+2nk for 1 ≤ k ≤ m and x2j = ¯x2j−1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Furthermore the special subnetwork must transform such inputs so that x2m+2n+j = 1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ m.  b  For example, the special subnetwork for  y1 ∨ y2 ∨ ¯y3  ∧  ¯y2 ∨ y3 ∨ ¯y4  ∧ . . .  could be  [1 + 2n:2mn + 2n + 1][3 + 2n:2mn + 2n + 1][6 + 2n:2mn + 2n + 1]  [4 + 4n:2mn + 2n + 2][5 + 4n:2mn + 2n + 2][8 + 4n:2mn + 2n + 2] ... , using x2j−1+2kn and x2j+2kn to represent yj and ¯yj in the kth clause, and x2m+2n+k to represent that clause itself. 53.

Now observe that the first t − 1 levels of the network consist of two separate networks, one for the 2t−1 red lines and another for the 2t−1 blue lines. The comparators on the tth level complete a merging network, as in the bitonic or odd-even merge. This establishes the desired result for k = 1.  The red-blue decomposition also establishes the case k = 2. For if the input is 4-ordered, the red lines contain 2t−1 numbers that are 2-ordered, and so do the blue lines, so we are left with  x0y0y1x1x2y2y3x3 . . .  case  a    or  x0x1y0y1x2x3y2y3 . . .  case  b    after t − 1 levels; the final result  x0∧y0  x0∨y0  y1∧x1  y1∨x1  . . . is clearly 2-ordered.  or  x0 x1∧y0  x1∨y0  y1∧x2  y1∨x2  . . .   5.3.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  673  ,  m2  j=0  m2    bk =  Now for k ≥ 2, we can assume that k ≤ t. The first t − k + 2 levels decompose into 2k−2 separate networks of size 2t−k+2, which each are 2-ordered by the case k = 2; hence the lines are 2k−1-ordered after t − k + 2 levels. The subsequent levels clearly preserve 2k−1-ordering, because they have a “vertical” periodicity of order 2k−2.  We can imagine −∞ on lines −1, −2, . . . and +∞ on lines 2t, 2t + 1, . . . .   −1  References: Network  a  was introduced by M. Dowd, Y. Perl, L. Rudolph, and M.

It is interesting to note that in case  a  we have Dnα = Gt, where Gt is defined in exercise 32 [Dowd et al., Theorem 17]; thus the image of Dn is not enough by itself to characterize the behavior of a periodic network. 54. The following construction by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [FOCS 33  1992 , 686–692] shows how to sort m3 elements with four levels of m2-sorters: We may suppose that the elements being sorted are 0s and 1s; let the lines be numbered  a, b, c  = am2 + bm + c for 0 ≤ a, b, c < m. The first level sorts the lines { a, b,  b + k  mod m   0 ≤ a, b < m} for 0 ≤ k < m; let ak be the number of 1s in the kth group of m2 lines. The second level sorts { a, b, k   0 ≤ a, b < m} for 0 ≤ k < m; the number of 1s in the kth group is then  and it follows that b0 ≤ b1 + 1, b1 ≤ b2 + 1, . . . , bm−1 ≤ b0 + 1. In the third level we sort { k, a, b   0 ≤ a, b < m} for 0 ≤ k < m; the number of 1s in the kth group is   a k−j  mod m + j  bi + km + j m−1 m−1 If 0 < ck+1 < m2 we have ck ≤m−1  and cj = 0 for j < k.

This proves the stated result, since f f m   > m2 when m > 24.  The construction is not “tight,” so we can probably do the job with substantially fewer than 16 levels.  55.  [If P  n  denotes the minimum number of switches needed in a permutation network, it is clear that P  n  ≥ ⌈lg n!⌉. By slightly extending a construction due to L. J. Goldstein and S. W. Leibholz, IEEE Trans. EC-16  1967 , 637–641, one can show that P  n  ≤ P  ⌊n 2⌋  + P  ⌈n 2⌉  + n − 1, hence P  n  ≤ B n  for all n, where B n  is the binary insertion function of Eq. 5.3.1– 3 . M. W.

Otherwise at least one of the following four cases applies, where y is not sorted:  1  x = y0, αx = αy[n−1: n][n−2: n−1] . . . [1:2].  2  x = y1, αx = αy[1: n][2: n] . . .

[See H. Zhu and R. Sedgewick, STOC 14  1982 , 296–302.] The stated delay time is easily verified by induction. But the problem of analyzing the recurrence  2  A m, n  = A ⌊m 2⌋,⌈n 2⌉  + A ⌈m 2⌉,⌊n 2⌋  + ⌈m 2⌉ + ⌈n 2⌉ − 1,  when A 0, n  = A m, 0  = 0, is more difficult. A bitonic merge makes B m, n  = C ′ m + n  comparisons; see  15 . Therefore we can use the fact that {⌊m 2⌋ + ⌈n 2⌉,⌈m 2⌉ + ⌊n 2⌋} = {⌊ m + n  2⌋,⌈ m + n  2⌉} to show that B m, n  = B ⌊m 2⌋,⌈n 2⌉  + B ⌈m 2⌉,⌊n 2⌋  + ⌊ m + n  2⌋. Then A m, n  ≤ B m, n  by induction. Let D m, n  = C m + 1, n + 1  + C m, n  − C m + 1, n  − C m, n + 1 . We have D 0, n  = D m, 0  = 1, and D m, n  = 1 when m + n is odd. Otherwise m + n is even and mn ≥ 1, and we have D m, n  = D ⌊m 2⌋,⌊n 2⌋ − 1. Consequently D m, n  ≤ 1 for all m, n ≥ 0. The recurrence for A is equivalent to the recurrence for C except when m and n are both odd. And in that case we have A m, n  ≥ C ⌊m 2⌋,⌈n 2⌉  + C ⌈m 2⌉,⌊n 2⌋  + ⌈m 2⌉ + ⌈n 2⌉ − 1 = C m, n  + 1 − D ⌊m 2⌋,⌊n 2⌋  ≥ C m, n  by induction. Let l = ⌈lg min m, n ⌉. On level k of the even-odd recursion, for 0 ≤ k < l, we per- form 2k merges of the respective sizes  mjk, njk  =  ⌊ m+j  2k⌋,⌊ n+2k − 1−j  2k⌋  j ⌈mjk 2⌉+⌈njk 2⌉−1 , is fk m +fk n −2k; we can write fk n  = max n′k, n − n′k , where n′k = 2k⌊n 2k+1 + 1 2⌋ is the multiple of 2k that is nearest to n 2. Since 0 ≤ fk n  − n 2 ≤ 2k−1, the total cost of recursion for levels 0 to l − 1 lies between 1 Finally, if m ≤ n, the 2l merges  mjl, njl  on level l have mjl = 0 for 0 ≤ j < 2l−m, and mjl = 1 for the other m values of j. Since A 1, n  = n, the total cost of level l is  for 0 ≤ j < 2k. The cost of recursion,  2 m + n l − 2l and 1  2 m + n l.  k m = m−1  2 + n.  Thus even-odd merging, unlike bitonic merging, is within O m + n  of the opti- mum number of comparisons ˆM m, n . Our derivation shows in fact that A m, n  = k=0 fk m  + fk n  − 2k  + gl m + n  − gl max m, n  , where gl n  can be expressed  k=0⌊k 2l⌋ = ⌊n 2l⌋ n − 2l−1 ⌊n 2l⌋ + 1  .  58. If h[k + 1] = h[k] + 1 and the file is not in order, something must happen to it on the next pass; this decreases the number of inversions, by exercise 5.2.2–1, hence the file will eventually become sorted. But if h[k + 1] ≥ h[k] + 2 for 1 ≤ k < m, the smallest key will never move into its proper place if it is initially in R2. 59. We use the hint, and also regard KN+1 = KN+2 = ··· = 1. If Kh[1]+j = ··· = Kh[m]+j = 1 at step j, and if Ki = 0 for some i > h[1] + j, we must have i < h[m] + j since there are fewer than n 1s. Suppose k and i are minimal such that h[k] + j < i < h[k + 1] + j and Ki = 0. Let s = h[k + 1] + j − i; we have s < h[k + 1] − h[k] ≤ k. At step j − s, at least k + 1 0s must have been under the heads, since Ki = Kh[k+1]+j−s was set to zero at that step; s steps later, there are at least k + 1 − s ≥ 2 0s remaining between Kh[1]+j and Ki, inclusive, contradicting the minimality of i. The second pass gets the next n − 1 elements into place, etc. If we start with the permutation N N−1 . . . 2 1, the first pass changes it to  ⌊k 2l⌋ ≤m+n−1  k=n  k=n  m+n−1 l−1 in the formn−1  N+1−n N−n . . . 1 N+2−n . . . N−1 N,  since Kh[1]+j > Kh[m]+j whenever 1 ≤ h[1] + j and h[m] + j ≤ N; therefore the bound is best possible.   5.3.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  675  60. Suppose that h[k + 1] − s > h[k] and h[k] ≤ s; the smallest key ends in position Ri for i > 1 if it starts in Rn−s. Therefore h[k + 1] ≤ 2h[k] is necessary; it is also sufficient, by the special case t = 0 of the following result: If n = N and if K1 . . . KN is a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}, a single Theorem. sorting pass will set Ki = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ t + 1, if h[k + 1] ≤ h[k] + h[k − i] + i for 1 ≤ k < m and 0 ≤ i ≤ t.  By convention, let h[k] = k when k ≤ 0.  Proof. By induction on t; if step t does not find the key t + 1 under the heads, we may assume that it appears in position Rh[k+1]+t−s for some s > 0, where h[k+1]−s < h[k]; hence h[k − t] + t − s > 0. But this is impossible if we consider step t − s, which presumably placed the element t + 1 into position Rh[k+1]+t−s although there were at least t + 1 lower heads active.   The condition is necessary for t = 0 and t = 1, but not for t = 2.   61. If the numbers {1, . . . , 23} are being sorted, the theorem in the previous exercise shows that {1, 2, 3, 4} find their true destination. When 0s and 1s are being sorted one can verify that it is impossible to have all heads reading 0 while all positions not under the heads contain 1s, at steps −2, −1, and 0; hence the proof in the previous exercise can be extended to show that {5, 6, 7} find their true destination. Finally {8, . . . , 23} must be sorted, by the argument in exercise 59. 63. When r ≤ m−2, the heads take the string 0p110130170 . . . 012r−101q into the string 0p+1110130170 . . . 012r−1 −1012r−1+q; hence m−2 passes are necessary. [When the heads are at positions 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . , 1+2m−2, Pratt has discovered a similar result: The string 0p1a012b−1012b+1 −10 . . . 012r−1 −1012r+q, hence at least m−⌈log2 m⌉−1 passes are necessary in the worst case for this sequence of heads. The latter head sequence is of special interest since it has been used as the basis of a very ingenious sorting device invented by P. N. Armstrong [see U.S. Patent 3399383  1965 ]. Pratt conjectures that these input sequences provide the true worst case, over all inputs.] 64. During quicksort, each key K2, . . . , KN is compared with K1; let A = {i  Ki < K1}, B = {j  Kj > K1}. Subsequent operations quicksort A and B independently; all comparisons Ki : Kj for i in A and j in B are suppressed, by both quicksort and the restricted uniform algorithm, and no other comparisons are suppressed by the unrestricted uniform algorithm.  −10 . . . 012r−101q, 1 ≤ a ≤ 2b−1, goes into 0p+11a−1012b−1012b+1  In this case we could restrict the algorithm even further, omitting cases 1 and 2 so that arcs are added to G only when comparisons are explicitly made, yet considering only paths of length 2 when testing for redundancy. Another way to solve this problem is to consider the equivalent tree insertion sorting algorithm of Section 6.2.2, which makes precisely the same comparisons as the uniform algorithm in the same order. 65.  a  The probability that Kai is compared with Kbi is the probability that ci other specified keys do not lie between Kai and Kbi; this is the probability that two numbers chosen at random from {1, 2, . . . , ci+2} are consecutive, namely 2  ci + 2 .  b  The first n − 1 values of ci are zero, then come  n − 2  1s,  n − 3  2s, k=1  n + 1   k + 1  − 1  =  c  The “bipartite” nature of merging shows that the restricted uniform algorithm is the same as the uniform algorithm for this sequence.

No; when N = 5 every pair sequence beginning with  1, 2  2, 3  3, 4  4, 5  1, 5  will avoid at least one subsequent comparison. [An interesting research problem: For all N, find a  restricted  uniform sorting method whose worst case is as good as possible.] 67. Suppose ci = j for exactly tj values of i. For the restricted case we need to prove j tj  2 + j  is minimized when  t0, t1, . . . , tN−2  =  N−1, . . . , 2, 1 . Gil Kalai has shown that the achievable vectors  t0, t1, . . . , tN−2  are always lexicographically ≥  N−1, . . . , 2, 1 ; see Graphs and Combinatorics 1  1985 , 65–79. 68. An item can lose at most one inversion per pass, so the minimum number of passes is at least the maximum number of inversions of any item in the input permutation. The bubble sort strategy achieves this bound, since each pass decreases the inversion count of every inverted item by one  see exercise 5.2.2–1 . An additional pass may be needed to determine whether or not sorting is complete, but the wording of this exercise allows us to overlook such considerations.  It is perhaps unfortunate that the first theorem in the study of computational complexity via automata established the “optimality” of a sorting method that is so poor from a programming standpoint! The situation is analogous to the history of random number generation, which took several backward steps when generators that are “optimum” from one particular point of view were recommended for general use.  See the comments following Eq. 3.3.3– 39 .  The moral is that optimality results are often heavily dependent on the abstract model; the results are quite interesting, but they must be applied wisely in practice.  [Demuth went on to consider a generalization to an r-register machine  saving a factor of r , and to a Turing-like machine in which the direction of scan could oscillate between left-right and right-left at will. He observed that the latter type of machine can do the straight insertion and the cocktail-shaker sorts; but any such 1-register machine 4 N 2 − N  steps on the average, since each step reduces the must go through at least 1 total number of inversions by at most one. Finally he considered r-register random- access machines and the question of minimum-comparison sorting. These portions of his thesis have been reprinted in IEEE Transactions C-34  1985 , 296–310.]  SECTION 5.4 1. We could omit the internal sorting phase, but that would generally be much slower since it would increase the number of times each piece of data is read and written on the external memory. 2. The runs are distributed as in  1 , then Tape 3 is set to R1 . . . R2000000; R2000001 . . . R4000000; R4000001 . . . R5000000. After all tapes are rewound, a “one-way merge” sets T1 and T2 to the respective contents of T3 and T4 in  2 . Then T1 and T2 are merged to T3, and the information is copied back and merged once again, for a total of five passes. In general, the procedure is like the four-tape balanced merge, but with copy passes between each of the merge passes, so one less than twice as many passes are performed.  3.  a  ⌈logP S⌉.  b  logB S, where B =P  T − P   is called the “effective power of power isP  P − 1  = P − 1  the merge.” When T = 2P the effective power is P ; when T = 2P − 1 the effective  8 P −1 + O P −2 , slightly less than 1  2 − 1  2 T.   5.4.1  677 2 T. If T is odd and P must be an integer, both ⌈T  2⌉ and ⌊T  2⌋ give the same 4. 1 maximum value. It is best to have P ≥ T − P , according to exercise 3, so we should choose P = ⌈T  2⌉ for balanced merging.

False; the complete binary tree with P external nodes is defined for all P ≥ 1. 6. Insert “If T = LOC X[0]  then go to R2, otherwise” at the beginning of step R6, and delete the similar clause from step R7. 7. There is no output, and RMAX stays equal to 0. 8. If any of the first P actual keys were ∞, their records would be lost. To avoid ∞, we can make two almost-identical copies of the program; the first copy omits the test involving LASTKEY in step R4, and it jumps to the second copy when RC ̸= 0 in step R3 for the first time. The second copy needs no step R1, and it never needs to test RC in step R3.  Further optimization is possible because of answer 10.  9. Assume, for example, that the current run is ascending, while the next should be descending. Then the steps of Algorithm R will work properly except for one change: In step R6, if RN L  = RN Q  > RC, reverse the test on KEY L  versus KEY Q .  When RC changes, the key tests of steps R4 and R6 should change appropriately. 10. Let ·j ≡ LOC X[j] , and suppose we add the unnecessary assignment ‘LOSER ·0  ← Q’ at the beginning of step R3. The mechanism of Algorithm R ensures that the follow- ing conditions are true just after we’ve done that assignment: The values of LOSER ·0 , . . . , LOSER · P − 1   are a permutation of {·0, ·1, . . . ,· P − 1 }; and there exists a permutation of the pointers {LOSER ·j   RN LOSER ·j   = 0} that corresponds to an actual tournament. In other words, when RN ·j  is zero, the value of KEY ·j  is irrele- vant; we may permute such “winners” among themselves. After P iterations all RN ·j  will be nonzero, so the entire tree will be consistent.  The answer to the hint is “yes.”  David P. Kanter observes that we can go directly from R6 to R4 as soon as RN Q  = 0, thereby avoiding all comparisons that involve uninitialized keys when N ≥ P . 11. True.  The proof of Theorem K notes that both keys belong to the same sub- sequence; hence the probability is 1 2, given that LASTKEY ̸= ∞.    678  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.4.1  3 P in the last.  3 P records in the penultimate run, 1  13. The keys left in memory when the first run has ended tend to be smaller than average, since they didn’t make it into the first run. Thus the second run can output more of the smaller keys. 14. Assume that the snow suddenly stops when the snowplow is at a random point x, 0 ≤ x < 1, after it has reached its steady state. Then the next-to-last run contains  2−  1−x 2 P records, and the last run contains x2P . Integrating this times dx yields an average of  2 − 1 15. False; the last run can be arbitrarily long, whenever all records in memory belong to the same run at the moment the input is exhausted  for example, in a one-pass sort . 16. If and only if each element has fewer than P inversions.  See Sections 5.1.1, 5.4.8.  The probability is 1 when N ≤ P , P N−PP ! N! when N ≥ P , by considering inversion tables.  In actual practice, however, a one-pass sort is not too uncommon, since people tend to sort a file even when they suspect that it might be in order, as a precautionary measure.  17. Exactly ⌈N P ⌉ runs, all but the last having length P .  The “worst case.”  18. Nothing changes on the second pass, since it is possible to show that the kth record of a run is less than at least P + 1 − k records of the preceding run, for 1 ≤ k ≤ P .  However, there seems to be no simple way to characterize the result of P -way replacement selection followed by P ′-way replacement selection when P ′ > P .  19. Argue as in the derivation of  2  that h x, t  dx = KL dt, where this time h x, t  = I + Kt for all x, and P = LI. This implies x t  = L ln  I + Kt  I , so that when x T   = L we have KT =  e − 1 I. The amount of snowfall since t = 0 is therefore  e − 1 LI =  e − 1 P . 20. As in exercise 19, we have  I + Kt  dx = K L− x  dt; hence x t  = LKt  I + Kt . 0 x t K dt = L KT − I ln  I + KT   I  ; hence KT = αI, where α ≈ 2.14619 is the root of 1 + α = eα−1. The run length is the total amount of snowfall during 0 ≤ t ≤ T, namely LKT = αP . 21. Proceed as in the text, but after each run wait for P − P ′ snowflakes to fall before the plow starts out again. This means that h x t , t  is now KT1, instead of KT, where T1 − T is the amount of time taken by the extra snowfall. The run length is LKT1, 0 x t K dt = P + LK T − T1 . In other words, a run length of eθP is obtained when P ′ =  1− 1− θ eθ P , for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1. 22. For 0 ≤ t ≤  κ − 1 T, dx · h = K dt  x t + T   − x t  , and for  κ − 1 T ≤ t ≤ T, dx · h = K dt  L − x t  , where h is seen to be constantly equal to KT at the position It follows that for 0 ≤ j ≤ k, 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, and t =  κ − j − u T , of the plows. we have x t  = L 1 − eu−θFj u  F  κ  . The run length is LKT , the amount of snowfall between the times that consecutive snowplows leave point 0 in the steady state; P is the amount cleared during each snowplow’s last burst of speed, namely 0 x t K dt can be shown to have the stated form. It turns out that the stated formulas are valid also for k = 0. When Notes: k ≥ 1 the number of elements per run that go into the reservoir twice is P ′′ = x t K dt, and it is easy to show that  run length  − P ′ + P ′′ =  e − 1 P , 0 a phenomenon noticed by Frazer and Wong. Is it a coincidence that the generating function for Fk θ  is so similar to the generating function in exercise 5.1.3–11?

Let P = pP ′ and q = 1 − p. For the first T1 units of time the snowfall comes from the qP ′ elements remaining in the reservoir after the first pP ′ have been initially removed in random order; and when the old reservoir is empty, uniform snow begins to fall again. We choose T1 so that LKT1 = qP ′. For 0 ≤ t ≤ T1, h x, t  =  p+qt T1 g x , where g x  is the height of snow put into the reservoir from position x; for T1 ≤ t ≤ T, h x, t  = g x + t− T1 K. For 0 ≤ t ≤ T1, g x t   is  q T1− t  T1 g x t  + T − T1 K; and for T1 ≤ t ≤ T, g x t   =  T − t K. Hence h x t , t  =  T − T1 K for 0 ≤ t ≤ T, and x t  = L 1 − exp −t  T − T1   . The total run length is LK T − T1 ; the total amount “recycled” from the reservoir back again  see exercise 22  is LKT1; and the total amount cleared after time T is P = KT  L − x T   . So the assumptions of this exercise give runs of length  es s P when the reservoir size is  1 +  s − 1 es s P . This is considerably worse than the results of exercise 22, since the reservoir contents are being used in a more advantageous order in that case.  The fact that h x t , t  is constant in so many of these problems is not surprising, since it is equivalent to saying that the elements of each run obtained during a steady state of the system are uniformly distributed.  24.  a  Essentially the same proof works; each of the subsequences has runs in the same direction as the output runs.  b  The stated probability is the probability that the run has length n + 1 and is followed by y; it equals  1 − x n n! when x > y, and it is  1 − x n n! −  y − x n n! when x ≤ y.  c  Induction. For example, if the nth run is ascending, the  n − 1 st was descending with probability p, so the first integral applies.  d  We find that f′ x  = f x  − c − pf 1 − x  − qf x , then f′′ x  = −2pc, pex + qe1−x is monotone increasing for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, and  1 which ultimately leads to f x  = c 1 − qx − px2 , c = 6  3 + p .  e  If p > eq then 0 pex + qe1−x − e1 2 dx = p + qe, so  1 pqe and p − √ 2 √ 0 pex + qe1−x − 1 C such that 1 qe 2 < 0.4; and if  1 − ey−1  1 p < q we may use a symmetrical argument.

For example, if P ′ = .5P and we continue replace- ment selection until the current run contains .209P records, the average run length increases from about 2.55P to about 2.61P with this modification. If P ′ = P and we continue replacement selection until only .314P records remain in the current run, the average run length increases from eP to about 3.034P . [See Comp. J. 27  1984 , 334– 339, where an even more efficient method called “merge replacement” is also presented.] 28. For multiway merging there is comparatively little problem, since P stays constant and records are processed sequentially on each file; but when forming initial runs, we would like to vary the number of records in memory depending on their lengths. We could keep a heap of as many records as will fit in memory, using dynamic storage allocation as described in Section 2.5. M. A. Goetz [Proc. AFIPS Joint Computer Conf. 25  1964 , 602–604] has suggested another approach, breaking each record into fixed-size parts that are linked together; they occupy space at the leaves of the tree, but only the leading part participates in the tournament. 29. The top 2k loser nodes go into the corresponding host positions. The remaining loser nodes consist of 2k subtrees of 2n − 1 nodes each; they are assigned to host nodes in symmetric order — the leftmost subtree into the leftmost host node, etc. [See K. Efe and N. Eleser, Acta Informatica 34  1997 , 429–447.] 30. Suppose t of the host nodes hold a connected 2n-node subgraph of the complete 2n+k-node loser tree. That tree has one node at level 0 and 2l−1 nodes at level l for 1 ≤ l ≤ n + k. A subtree rooted at level l ≥ 1 has 2n+k+1−l − 1 nodes; therefore the roots of t disjoint 2n-node subtrees must all be on levels ≤ k. And each of these subtrees must contain at least one node on level k, because there are only 2k−1 < 2n nodes on levels < k. It follows that t ≤ 2k−1. But the number of edges in the host graph is at least t + 2 2k − t  − 1, by  ii  and  iii , since there are at least this many loser nodes whose parent has a different image in the host.  [The hypothesis n ≥ k is necessary: When n = k − 1 there is a suitable host graph  with 2k + 2k−1 − 2 edges.]  SECTION 5.4.2 1.  1 6 10 13 18 20 24 29  2 7 11 14 19 21 25 30  3 8 12 15 22 26 31  4 9 16 23 27 32  5 17 28 33   5.4.2  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  681  2.

Let gp z  =  z−1 fp z  = zp+1−2zp+1, and let hp z  = zp+1−2zp. Rouché’s the- orem [J. École Polytechnique 21, 37  1858 , 1–34] tells us that hp z  and gp z  have the same number of roots inside the circle z = 1+ϵ, provided hp z  > hp z −gp z  = 1 on the circle. If ϕ−1 > ϵ > 0 we have hp z  ≥  1+ϵ p 1−ϵ  >  1+ϕ−1 2 1−ϕ−1  = 1. Hence gp has p roots of magnitude ≤ 1. They are distinct, since gcd gp z , g′p z   = gcd gp z ,  p + 1 z − 2p  = 1.

Thus, ln S = n ln α + ln c0 + O  αR −n ; and n =  ln S ln α  + O 1  implies that O  αR −n  = O S−ϵ .

See the sequences of 0s and 1s in exercise 9, in the order listed.  A similar number system has been studied by W. C.

Let r be any positive −r  k−1  > Tn′ k−1 ; then T n−r  k−1  ≥ integer, and let n′ be minimal such that T n′ Tn k−1  for all n ≥ n′, since this relation is trivial for n ≥ n k − 1  + r and otherwise −r  k−1  ≥ Tn′ k−1  ≥ Tn k−1 .  b  The same argument with r = T n−r  k−1  ≥ T n′ n − n′ shows that Tn′k′ < Tnk′ implies T n′ −j k′ ≤ T n−j k′ for all j ≥ 0; hence the −j k ≤ T n−j k for all j ≥ 0 and k ≥ k′.  c  Let ℓ S  be recurrence implies that T n′ the least n such that Σn S  assumes its minimum value.

There is some smallest S′ such that Σn S′  < Σn′ S′ , and we have m = Σn S′ −Σn S′−1  < Σn′ S′ −Σn′ S′−1  = m′. k=1 Tnk; hence there is some k′ ≤ m such that Tn′k′ < Tnk′. k=1 Tn′k ≥ k=1 Tnk.

Let T = 3; A11 x  = 6x6 + 35x7 + 56x8 + ··· , B11 x  = x6 + 15x7 + 35x8 + ··· , T11 x  = 7x6 + 50x7 + 91x8 + 64x9 + 19x10 + 2x11. The optimum distribution for S = 144 requires 55 runs on T2, and this forces a nonoptimum distribution for S = 145. D. A. Zave has studied near-optimum procedures of this kind. 18. Let S = 9, T = 3, and consider the following two patterns.  T3 Cost  Optimum Polyphase: T1 T2 0216 0213 — 13 — 0223 22 — 1231 32 31 — 31 — 61 — 91 —  6 5 6 6 9 32  T3 Cost  Alternative: T1 T2 0116 0113 — 13 — 0123 21 — 1132 32 — 31 — 31 61 91 — —  6 7 3 6 9 31   Still another way to improve on “optimum” polyphase is to reconsider where dummy runs appear on the output tape of every merge phase. For example, the result of merging 0213 with 0213 might be regarded as 2101210121 instead of 0223. Thus, many unresolved questions of optimality remain.    5.4.2  19.

It works if and only if the gcd of the distribution numbers is 1. For example, if we distribute  a, b, c, d, e  to T1 through T5, where a ≥ let there be six tapes; b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ e > 0, the first phase leaves a distribution  a−e, b−e, c−e, d−e, e , and   684  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.4.2  gcd a−e, b−e, c−e, d−e, e  = gcd a, b, c, d, e , since any common divisor of one set of numbers divides the others too. The process decreases the number of runs at each phase until gcd a, b, c, d, e  runs are left on a single tape.  [Nonpolyphase distributions sometimes turn out to be superior to polyphase under certain configurations of dummy runs, as shown in exercise 18. This phenomenon was first observed by B. Sackman about 1963.] 28. We get any such  a, b, c, d, e  by starting with  1, 0, 0, 0, 0  and doing the following operation exactly n times: Choose x in {a, b, c, d, e}, and add x to each of the other four elements of  a, b, c, d, e . To show that a+b+c+d+e ≤ tn, we shall prove that if a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d ≥ e on level n, we always have a ≤ an, b ≤ bn, c ≤ cn, d ≤ dn, e ≤ en.

An initial run must be A if and only if its merge number is even, D if and only if odd. Simple distribution schemes such as Algorithm 5.4.2D are not quite as effective at placing dummies into high-merge-number positions; therefore it is probably advantageous to compute Qn between phases 1 and 2, in order to help control dummy run placement. 6. y 4  =  +1, +1,−1, +1  y 3  =  +1, 0,−1, 0  y 2  =  +1,−1, +1, +1  y 1  =  −1, +1, +1, +1  y 0  =   1, 0, 0, 0    5.4.4  7.  See exercise 15.   ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  687  Incidentally, 34 is apparently the smallest Fibonacci number Fn for which polyphase doesn’t produce the optimum read-backward merge for Fn initial runs on three tapes. This tree has external path length 178, which beats polyphase’s 180. 8. For T = 4, the tree with external path length 13 is not T -lifo, and every tree with external path length 14 includes a one-way merge. 9. We may consider a complete  T −1 -ary tree, by the result of exercise 2.3.4.5–6; the degree of the “last” internal node is between 2 and T −1. When there are  T −1 q − m external nodes, ⌊m  T − 2 ⌋ of them are on level q − 1, and the rest are on level q. 11. True by induction on the number of initial runs. If there is a valid distribution with S runs and two adjacent runs in the same direction, then there is one with fewer than S runs; but there is none when S = 1. 12. Conditions  a  and  b  are obvious. If either configuration in  4  is present, for some tape name A and some i < j < k, node j must be in a subtree below node i and to the left of node k, by the definition of preorder. Hence the case “j −−− l” can’t be present, and A must be the “special” name since it appears on an external branch. But this contradicts the fact that the special name is supposed to be on the leftmost branch below node i. 13. Nodes now numbered 4, 7, 11, 13 could be external instead of one-way merges.  This gives an external path length one higher than the polyphase tree.  15. Let the tape names be A, B, and C. We shall construct several species of trees, botanically identified by their root and leaf  external node  structure:  Root A  Type r A  Type s A, C  Root A, no C leaves Type t A  Root A, no A leaves Type u A, C  Root A, no C leaves, no compound B leaves Type v A, C  Root A, no C leaves, no compound A leaves Type w A, C  Root A, no A leaves, no compound C leaves  A  1  2  18  B  C  A  12  A  C  8  3  B  4  C  A  C  20  B  A  28  27  C  32  11  19  B  14  24  B  C  25  B  26  B  22  A  5  C  A  7  B  9  B  13  C  A  C  A  17  15  A  21  B  23  B  29  C  A  31  B  33  B  C  A  B  A  C  A  C  A  B  A  B  A  C  A  C  A  C  A  B  A  C  6  10  16  A  B  A  B  A  B  A  C  A  C  30  A  B   688  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.4.4  A “compound leaf” is a leaf whose sibling is not a leaf. We can grow a 3-lifo type r A  tree by first growing its left subtree as a type s B, C , then growing the right subtree as type r C . Similarly, type s A, C  comes from a type s B, C  then t C ; type u A, C  from v B, C  and w C, B ; type v A, C  from u B, C  and w C, A . We can grow a 3-lifo type t A  tree whose left subtree is type u B, A  and whose right subtree is type s C, A , by first letting the left subtree grow except for its  non-compound  C leaves and its right subtree; at this point the left subtree has only A and B leaves, so we can grow the right subtree of the whole tree, then grow off the A leaves of the left left subtree, and finally grow the left right subtree. Similarly, a type w A, C  tree can be fabricated from a u B, A  and a v C, A . [The tree of exercise 7 is an r A  tree constructed in this manner.]  Let r n , . . . , w n  denote the minimum external path length over all n-leaf trees of the relevant type, when they are constructed by such a procedure. We have r 1  = s 1  = u 1  = 0, r 2  = t 2  = w 2  = 2, t 1  = v 1  = w 1  = s 2  = u 2  = v 2  = ∞; and for n ≥ 3,  r n  = n + mink s k  + r n − k  , s n  = n + mink s k  + t n − k  , t n  = n + mink u k  + s n − k  ,  u n  = n + mink v k  + w n − k  , v n  = n + mink u k  + w n − k  , w n  = n + mink u k  + v n − k  .  It follows that r n  ≤ s n  ≤ u n , s n  ≤ v n , and r n  ≤ t n  ≤ w n  for all n; furthermore s 2n  = t 2n + 1  = ∞.  The latter is evident a priori.  Let A n  be the function defined by the laws A 1  = 0, A 2n  = 2n + 2A n , A 2n+1  = 2n+1+ A n + A n+1 ; then A 2n  = 2n+ A n−1 + A n+1 − 0 or 1  for all n ≥ 2. Let C be a constant such that, for 4 ≤ n ≤ 8,  6 n−1. [The constant 5  i  n even implies that w n  ≤ A n  + Cn − 1. ii  n odd implies that u n  and v n  are ≤ A n  + Cn − 1.  This actually works for all C ≥ 5 6.  Then an inductive argument, choosing k to be ⌊n 2⌋ ± 1 as appropriate, shows that the relations are valid for all n ≥ 4. But A n  is the lower bound in  9  when T = 3, and r n  ≤ min u n , v n , w n  , hence we have proved that A n  ≤ ˆK3 n  ≤ r n  ≤ A n + 5 6 can be improved.] 17.

A strongly T -fifo tree has a T -fifo labeling in which there are no three branches having the respective forms  ,  or  ,  or  ,  for some tape name A and some i < j < k < l < s. Informally, when we grow on an A, we must grow on all other A’s before creating any new A’s. 21. It is very weakly fifo:  22.

Hence u 1  ⪯ C u , u 2  ⪯ C C u  , . . . , v ⪯ C [q] u . Hence v1 + ··· + vT is less than or equal to the sum of the elements of C [q] u ; and the latter is obtained in cascade merge. [This theorem generalizes the result of exercise 5.4.3–4. Unfortunately the concept of “stage” as defined here doesn’t seem to have any practical significance.] 24. Let y m  . . . y l+1  be a stage that reduces w to v. If we have y = 0, j = −1, for some k < i − 1, we can insert y k  between y i  . . . , y and y i−1 . Repeat this operation until all  −1 ’s in each column are adjacent. Then j ← 1; ultimately each column ̸= 0 it is possible to set y if y consists of +1’s followed by −1’s followed by 0s, and we have constructed a stage that reduces w′ to v for some w′ ⪰ w.

When T = 5 the undominated strategies are 1 32 n−12, 1 32 n−13 for q = 2n ≥ 2; 1 32 n−132, 1 32 n−122, 1 32 n−123 for q = 2n + 1 ≥ 3.  The first strategy listed has most runs in its distribution.  On six tapes they are 13 or 14, 142 or 132 or 133, 1333 or 1423, then 13q−1 for q ≥ 5.  SECTION 5.4.5 1. The following algorithm is controlled by a table A[L − 1] . . . A[1]A[0] that essen- tially represents a number in radix P notation. As we repeatedly add unity to this number, the carries tell us when to merge. Tapes are numbered from 0 to P .  O1. [Initialize.] Set  A[L−1], . . . , A[0]  ←  0, . . . , 0  and q ← 0.  During this  algorithm, q will equal  A[L−1] + ··· + A[0]  mod T.   O2. [Distribute.] Write an initial run on tape q, in ascending order. Set l ← 0. O3. [Add one.] If l = L, stop; the output is on tape  −L  mod T, in ascending order if and only if L is even. Otherwise set A[l] ← A[l]+1, q ←  q+1  mod T. O4. [Carry?] If A[l] < P , return to O2. Otherwise merge to tape  q − l  mod T ,  set A[l] ← 0 and q ←  q + 1  mod T, increase l by 1, and return to O3.  2. Keep track of how many runs are on each tape. When the input is exhausted, add dummy runs if necessary and continue merging until reaching a situation with at most one run on each tape and at least one tape empty. Then finish the sort in one more merge, rewinding some tapes first if necessary.  It is possible to deduce the orientation of the runs from the A table.  3.

To avoid useless copying in which runs are simply shifted back and forth, we can say “If the input is exhausted, go to B7” at the end of B3, and add the following new step:  B7. [Do the endgame.] Set s ← −1, and go to B2 after repeating the following operations until l = 0: Set s′ ← A[l − 1, q], and set q′ and r′ to the indices such that A[l − 1, q′] = −1 and A[l − 1, r′] = −2.  We will have q′ = r, and s′ ≤ A[l − 1, j] ≤ s′ + 1 for j ̸= q′, j ̸= r′.  If s′ − s is odd, promote level l, otherwise demote it  see below . Then merge to tape r, reading backwards; set l ← l − 1, A[l, q] ← −1, A[l, r] ← s′ + 1, r ← r′, and repeat.  Here “promotion” means to repeat the following operation until  q+ −1 s  mod T = r: Set p ←  q +  −1 s  mod T and copy one run from tape p to tape q, then set A[l, q] ← s + 1, A[l, p] ← −1, q ← p. And “demotion” means to repeat the following until  q −  −1 s  mod T = r: Set p ←  q −  −1 s  mod T and copy one run from tape p to tape q, then set A[l, q] ← s, A[l, p] ← −1, q ← p. The copy operation reads backwards   692  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.4.5  on tape p, hence it reverses the direction of the run being copied. If D[p] > 0 when copying from p to q, we simply decrease D[p] and increase D[q] instead of copying.  [The basic idea is that, once the input is exhausted, we want to reduce to at most one run on each tape. The parity of each nonnegative entry A[l, j] tells us whether a run is ascending or descending. The smallest S for which this change makes any difference is P 3 + 1. When P is large, the change hardly ever makes much difference, but it does keep the computer from looking too foolish in some circumstances. The algorithm should also be changed to handle the case S = 1 more efficiently.] 4. We can, in fact, omit setting A[0, 0] in step B1, A[l, q] in steps B3 and B5. [But A[l, r] must be set in step B3.] The new step B7 in the previous answer does need the value of A[l, q]  unless it explicitly uses the fact that q′ = r, as noted there . 5.

Step F2 insists that the test “Is output buffer full?” precede the test “Is input buffer empty?” while merging, otherwise we would have trouble  unless the changes of exer- cise 4 were made . 3. No; for example, we might reach a state with P buffers 1 P full and P − 1 buffers full, if file i contains the keys i, i + P , i + 2P , . . . , for 1 ≤ i ≤ P . This example shows that 2P input buffers would be necessary for continuous output even if we allowed simultaneous reading, unless we reallocated memory for partial buffers. [Well, we don’t really need 2P buffers if the blocks contain fewer than P − 1 records; but that is unlikely.] 4. Set up S sooner  in steps F1 and F4 instead of F3 . 5. If, for example, all keys of all files were equal, we couldn’t simply make arbitrary decisions while forecasting; the forecast must be compatible with decisions made by the merging process. One safe way is to find the smallest possible m in steps F1 and F4, namely to consider a record from file C[i] to be less than all records having the same key on file C[j] whenever i < j.  In essence, the file number is appended to the key.  6. In step C1 also set TAPE[T + 1] ← T + 1.

No, since at most S stop starts are saved, and since the speed of the input tape  not the output tapes  tends to govern the initial distribution time anyway.

But note that three output buffers are sufficient: At a given moment we can be performing the second half of a write from one, the first half of a write from another, and outputting into a third. This approach suggests a corresponding improvement in the input buffer situation. It turns out that 3P input buffers and 3 output buffers are necessary and sufficient, using a slightly weakened forecasting technique. A simpler and superior approach, suggested by J. Sue, adds a “lookahead key” to each block, specifying the final key of the subsequent block. Sue’s method requires 2P + 1 input buffers and 4 output buffers, and it is a straightforward modification of Algorithm F.  See also Section 5.4.9.    b  In this case the high value of α means that we must do between five and six passes over the data, which wipes out the advantage of double-quick merging. The idea works out much better on eight or nine tapes. 13. No; consider, for example, the situation just before A16A16A16A16.

Sort from least significant digit to most significant digit in the number system whose radices are alternately P and T − P .  If pairs of digits are grouped, we have essentially the pure radix P ·  T − P  . Thus, if P = 2 and T = 7, the number system is “biquinary,” related to decimal notation in a simple way.  2. If K is a key between 0 and Fn − 1, let the Fibonacci representation of Fn − 1− K be an−2Fn−1 + ··· + a1F2, where the aj are 0 or 1, and no two consecutive 1s appear. After phase j, tape  j + 1  mod 3 contains the keys with aj = 0, and tape  j − 1  mod 3 contains those with aj = 1, in decreasing order of aj−1 . . . a1. [Imagine a card sorter with two pockets, “0” and “1”, and consider the procedure of sorting Fn cards that have been punched with the keys an−2 . . . a1 in n− 2 columns. The conventional procedure for sorting these into decreasing order, starting at the least significant digit, can be simplified since we know that everything in the “1” pocket at the end of one pass will go into the “0” pocket on the following pass.] 4. If there were an external node on level 2 we could not construct such a good tree. Otherwise there are at most three external nodes on level 3, and six on level 4, since each external node is supposed to appear on the same tape. 5.  6. 09, 08, . . . , 00, 19, . . . , 10, 29, . . . , 20, 39, . . . , 30, 40, 41, . . . , 49, 59, . . . , 50, 60, 61, . . . , 99. 7. Yes; first distribute the records into smaller and smaller subfiles until obtaining one-reel files that can be sorted individually. This is dual to the process of sorting one-reel files and then merging them into larger and larger multireel files.  SECTION 5.4.8 1. Yes. If we alternately use ascending and descending order in the selection tree, we have in effect an order-P cocktail-shaker sort.  See exercise 9.  2.

Yes; find a median element in O N  steps, using a construction like that of Theorem 5.3.3L, and use it to partition the file. Another interesting approach, due to R. W. Floyd and A. J. Smith, is to merge two runs of N items in O N  units of time as follows: Spread the items out on the tapes, with spaces between them, then successively fill each space with a number specifying the final position of the item just preceding that space. 4. It is possible to piece together a schedule for floors {1, . . . , p + 1} with a schedule for floors {q, . . . , n}: When the former schedule first reaches floor p + 1, go up to floor q and carry out the latter schedule  using the current elevator contents as if they were the “extras” in the algorithm of Theorem K . After finishing that schedule, go back to floor p + 1 and resume the previous schedule. 5.

[After constructing an example such as this, the reader should be able to see how  to demonstrate the weaker property required in the proof of Theorem K.] 6. Let i and j be minimal with bi   b′j. Introduce a new person who wants to go from i to j. This doesn’t increase max uk, dk+1, 1  or max bk, b′k  for any k. Continue this until bj = b′j for all j. Now observe that the algorithm in the text works also with b replaced by bk in steps K1 and K3. 8. Let the number be Pn, and let Qn be the number of permutations such that uk = 1 for 1 ≤ k < n. Then Pn = Q1Pn−1 + Q2Pn−2 + ··· + QnP0, P0 = 1.

This correspondence was obtained by the author jointly with E. A. Bender.  9. The number of passes of the cocktail-shaker sort is 2 max u1, . . . , un  −  0 or 1 , since each pair of passes  left-right-left  reduces each of the nonzero u’s by 1. 10.

The change suggested in this exercise saves about 10 percent of the merging time, when n = 64 or 100 as in the text’s example. This style of buffer allocation was considered already in 1954 by H. Seward, who found that four-way merging minimizes the seek time.]   5.4.9  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  697  5. Let Am n  and Bm n  be the cost of optimum sets of m trees whose n leaves are all at  even, odd  levels, respectively.

[Curiously, n = 23 is the only value ≤ 50 for which no equal- parity tree with n leaves is optimal in the unrestricted-parity case. Perhaps it is the only such value, when α = β.] 7. Consider the quantities αd1 + βe1, . . . , αdn + βen in any tree, where dj is the degree sum and ej is the path length for the jth leaf. An optimum tree for weights w1 ≤ ··· ≤ wn will have αd1 + βe1 ≥ ··· ≥ αdn + βen. It is always possible to reorder the indices so that αd1 + βe1 = ··· = αdk + βek where the first k leaves are merged together. 9. Let d minimize  αm + β  ln m. A simple induction using convexity shows that A1 n  ≥  αd + β n logd n, with equality when n = dt. A suitable upper bound comes from complete d-ary trees, since these have D T   = dE T  , E T   = tn + dr for n = dt +  d − 1 r, 0 ≤ r ≤ dt. 10. See STOC 6  1974 , 216–229. 11. Using exercise 1.2.4–38, fm n  = 3qn + 2 n − 3qm , when 2 · 3q−1 ≤ n m ≤ 3q; fm n  = 3qn + 4 n − 3qm , when 3q ≤ n m ≤ 2 · 3q. Thus f2 n  + 2n ≥ f n , with equality if and only if 4 · 3q−1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 3q; f3 n  + 3n = f n ; f4 n  + 4n ≥ f n , with equality if and only if n = 4 · 3q; and fm n  + mn > f n  for all m ≥ 5. 12.

When n = 4 · 3q, two such trees are formed.  14.

If a people initially got on the elevator, the togetherness rating increases by at most a + b at the first stop. When it next stops at the initial floor, the rating increases by at most b + m − a. Hence the rating increases at most kb +  k − 1 m after k stops. 16. Eleven stops: 123456 to floor 2, 334466 to 3, 444666 to 4, 256666 to 5, 466666 to 6, 123445 to 4, 112335 to 5, 222333 to 3, 122225 to 2, 111555 to 5, 111111 to 1.

Conference on Information Sciences and Systems 6  1972 , 140–144.] 20. The internal sort must be carefully chosen, with paging in mind; methods such as shellsort, address calculation, heapsort, and list sorting can be disastrous if the actual internal memory is small, since they require a large “working set” of pages. Quicksort, radix exchange, and sequentially allocated merge or radix sorting are much better suited to a paging environment.  n log 1 + n  log 1 + m b   Some things the designer of an external sort can do that are virtually impossible to include in an automatically paged method are:  i  Forecasting the input file that should be read next, so that the data is available when it is required;  ii  choosing the buffer sizes and the order of merge according to hardware and data characteristics.  On the other hand a virtual machine is considerably easier to program, and it can give results that aren’t bad, if the programmer is careful and knows the properties of the underlying actual machine. The first substantial study of this question was made by Brawn, Gustavson, and Mankin [CACM 13  1970 , 483–494.] 21. ⌈ L − j  D⌉; see CMath, Eq.  3.24 . 22. After reading a group of D blocks that contains aj, we might need to know αj+D−1 before reading the next group of D blocks. And if we store αj+D−1 with aj, we also need the values α0, . . . , αD−2 in some sort of file header to get the process started. But with this scheme we cannot write blocks a0 . . . aD−1 until we have computed aD . . . a2D−2, so we will need 3D − 1 output buffers instead of 2D to keep writing continuously. It is therefore better to put the α’s in a separate  short  file. [The same analysis applies to randomized striping.]   5.4.9  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  699  23.  a  Algorithm 5.4.6F needs 4 input buffers, each of superblock size DB.  If we count output buffers as well, we have a total of 6DB buffer records in memory with Algorithm 5.4.6F and 5DB with SyncSort.    b  While we are reading a group of D blocks we need buffer space for the previous D blocks and one unfinished block, for a total of  2D + 1 B records.  Output requires another 2DB. But many data processing operations that do 2-way merging on input actually produce comparatively little output.  24. Let the lth block in chronological order be block jl of run kl; in particular, jl = 0  and kl = l for 1 ≤ l ≤ P . We will read that block at time tl =P  k=1 tlkd, where  tlkd = {r  1 ≤ r ≤ l and kr = k and  xk + jr  mod D = d}  is the number of blocks of run k on disk d that are chronologically ≤ l, and d =   xkl + jl  mod D. Let ulk = {r  1 ≤ r ≤ l and kr = k}; then   ulk −  d − xk  mod D  tlkd =  D  ,  because jr runs through the values 0, 1, . . . , ulk − 1 when 1 ≤ r ≤ l and kr = k. The sequence tl for the example of  19 ,  20 , and  21  is  11111 22223 43456 34567 82345 67893 . . . .  If l > P , the number of buffer blocks we need as we begin to merge from the lth block in chronological order is Il + D + P , where Il is the number of “inversions-with- equality” of tl, namely {r  r > l and tr ≤ tl}, the number of bufferfuls that we’ve read but aren’t ready to use; D represents the buffers into which the next input is going, and P represents the partially full buffers from which we are currently merging.  With special care, using links as in SyncSort, we could reduce the latter requirement from P to P − 1, but the extra complication is probably not worthwhile.  So the problem boils down to getting an upper bound on Il. We may assume that the input runs are infinitely long. Suppose s of the elements {t1, . . . , tl} are greater than tl; then tl has tlD − l + s inversions-with-equality, because exactly tlD elements are ≤ tl. It follows that the maximum Il occurs when s = 0 and tl is a left-to-right  maximum.

While D blocks are being read and D are being written, the merging procedure might generate up to P + Q − 1 blocks of output, under the assumptions of  24 .

The next Q blocks are never removed from the scratch buffers once they have been read. Thus the relevant blocks on disk j all are read by time ≤ t + Nj; they must all participate in the merge by time t + max N0, . . . , ND−1 .  b  If the  Q + 1 st block after a marked block is not removed, the same argument applies. Otherwise the previous Q are not marked, and the Q + 2 blocks cannot all be on different disks.   c  Divide the chronological order of blocks into groups of size Q + 2, and consider any particular group. If there are Mk blocks from run k, then the numbers Nj are equivalent to the number of balls in the jth urn, in a cyclic occupancy problem with n = D and m = Q + 2. Thus the expected number of marked cells in any group is at most the upper bound in exercise 27 b . Calling that upper bound en m , we may take r d, m  =  d m ed m .  [Actually this function r 2, m  is not monotonic in m when m is small. Therefore the entries listed for r 2, 4  and r 2, 12  in Table 2 are actually the values of r 2, 3  and r 2, 11 ; additional buffers cannot increase the number of marked blocks.] 30.

Convergence to this asymptotic behavior is rather slow  see Table 2 . 31.  When Q = 0, we mark the first block and then repeatedly mark the next block that shares a disk with one of the blocks in the group starting with the pre- viously marked block. For example, if the chronological order of disk accesses is 112020121210122, the marking would be ¯1¯120¯201¯21¯210¯12¯2. Therefore as P → ∞, we read an average of Q D n blocks during n units of time, where Q is Ramanujan’s function, defined in Eq. 1.2.11.3– 2 . By contrast, r d, 2  =  d + 1  2 gives a much more pessimistic estimate.   SECTION 5.5 1. It is difficult to decide which sorting algorithm is best in a given situation. 2. For small N, list insertion; for medium N, say N = 64, list merge; for large N, radix list sort. 3.  Solution by V. Pratt.  Given two nondecreasing runs α and β to be merged, determine in a straightforward way the subruns α1α2α3β1β2β3 such that α2 and β2 contain precisely the keys of α and β having the median value of the entire file. By successive “reversals,” first forming α1α2βR1 αR3 β2β3, then α1β1αR2 βR2 α3β3, then α1β1α2β2α3β3, we can reduce the problem to the merging of subfiles α1β1 and α3β3 that are of length ≤ N 2.   702  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  5.5  A considerably more complicated algorithm due to L. Trabb Pardo provides the best possible asymptotic answer to this problem: We can do stable merging in O N  time and stable sorting in O N log N  time, using only O log N  bits of auxiliary memory for a fixed number of index variables, without transforming the records being sorted in any way [SICOMP 6  1977 , 351–372].

Consider the corresponding tree, such as Fig. 6: When N is odd, the left subtree of the root is a mirror image of the right subtree, so K < Ki occurs just as often as 2 1 − S .

One idea is to find the least M ≥ 0 such that N + M has the form Fk+1 − 1, then to start with i ← Fk − M in step F1, and to insert “If i ≤ 0, go to F4” at the beginning of F2. A better solution would be to adapt Shar’s idea to the Fibonaccian case: If the result of the very first comparison is K > KFk, set i ← i− M and go to F4  proceeding normally from then on . This avoids extra time in the inner loop. 15. The external nodes appear on levels ⌊k 2⌋ through k − 1; the difference between these levels is greater than unity except when k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 16. The Fibonacci tree of order k, with left and right reversed, is the binary tree corre- sponding to the lineal chart up to the kth month, under the “natural correspondence” of Section 2.3.2, if we remove the topmost node of the lineal chart. 17.

See exercise 1.2.8–12 for the solution to related recurrences.  20.  a  b = p−pq−q.  b  There are at least two errors. The first blunder is that division is not a linear function, so it can’t be simply “averaged over.” Actually with probability p we get pN elements remaining, and with probability q we get qN, so we can expect to get  p2 + q2 N; thus the average reduction factor is really 1  p2 + q2 . Now the reduction factor after k iterations is 1  p2 + q2 k, but we cannot conclude that b = 1  p2 + q2  since the number of iterations needed to locate some of the items is much more than to locate others. This is a second fallacy.

Marsaglia and B. Narasimhan, Computers and Math. 26, 8  1993 , 31–42, show that the average number of table accesses is very close to lg lg N, plus about 0.7 if the search is unsuccessful. When N = 220, for example, a random successful search in a random table takes about 4.29 accesses, while a random unsuccessful search takes about 5.05. 23. Go to the right on ≥ , to the left on < ; when reaching node it follows from  1  that Ki ≤ K < Ki+1, so a final test for equality will distinguish between success or failure.  The key K0 = −∞ should always be present.  In C3 if DELTA[j] = 0, set i ← i − 1 and go to C5. In C4 if DELTA[j] = 0, go directly to C5. Add a new step C5: “If K = Ki, the algorithm terminates successfully, otherwise it terminates unsuccessfully.” [This would not speed up Program C unless N > 226; the average successful search time changes from  8.5 lg N − 6 u to  8 lg N + 7 u.] 24. The keys can be arranged so that we first set i ← 1, then i ← 2i or 2i + 1 according as K   Ki; the search is unsuccessful when i > N.

When programmed for MIX this method will take only about 6 lg N units of time, so it is faster than Program C. The only disadvantage is that it is a little tricky to set up the table in the first place. 25.  a  Since a0 = 1 − b0, a1 = 2a0 − b1, a2 = 2a1 − b2, etc., we have A z  + B z  = 1 + 2zA z . Several of the formulas derived in Section 2.3.4.5 follow immediately from this relation by considering A 1 , B 1 , B  1 2 , A′ 1 , and B′ 1 . If we use two variables to distinguish left and right steps of a path we obtain the more general result A x, y  + B x, y  = 1 +  x + y A x, y , a special case of a formula that holds in t-ary trees [see R.

At most k + 1 of the 2k outcomes will ever occur, since we may order the indices in such a way that Ki1 < Ki2 < ··· < Kik. Thus the search can be described by a tree with at most  k + 1 -way branching at each node. The number of items that can be found on the mth step is at most k k + 1 m−1; hence the average number of comparisons is at least N−1 times the sum of the smallest N elements of the multiset {k·1, k k + 1 ·2, k k + 1 2·3, . . .}. When N ≥  k + 1 n − 1, the average number of  comparisons is ≥   k + 1 n − 1 −1n  m=1 k k + 1 m−1m > n − 1 k.   708  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.2.1  28. [Skrifter udgivne af Videnskabs-Selskabet i Christiania, Mathematisk-Naturviden- skabelig Klasse  1910 , No. 8; reprinted in Thue’s Selected Mathematical Papers  Oslo: the so-called Lucas number Ln = ϕn+ϕ n.   b  The axiom says that T0 T2 x   = T1 x , Universitetsforlaget, 1977 , 273–310.]  a  Tn has Fn+1+Fn−1 = F2n Fn leaves.  This is and we obviously have Tm Tn x   = Tm+n−1 x  when m = 1 or n = 1. By induction on n, the result holds when m = 0; for example, T0 T3 x   = T0 T2 x  ∗ T1 x   = T0 T1 T2 x  ∗T0 T2 x    = T0 T2 T2 x    = T2 x . Finally we can use induction on m. 29. Assume that K0 = −∞ and KN+1 = KN+2 = ∞. First do a binary search on K2 < K4 < ··· ; this takes at most ⌊lg N⌋ comparisons. If unsuccessful, it determines an interval with K2j−2 < K < K2j; and K is not present if 2j = N + 2. Otherwise, a binary search for K2j−1 will determine i such that K2i−2 < K2j−1 < K2i. Then either K = K2i−1 or K is not present. [See Theor. Comp. Sci. 58  1988 , 67.] 30. Let n = ⌊N 4⌋. Starting with K1 < K2 < ··· < KN, we can put K1, K3, . . . , K2n−1 into any desired order by swapping them with a permutation of K2n+1, K2n+3, . . . , K4n−1; this arrangement satisfies the conditions of the previous exercise. Now we let K1 < K3 < ··· < K2t+1−3 represent the boundaries between all possible t-bit numbers, and we insert K2t+1−1, K2t+1+1, . . . , K2t+1+2m−3 between these “fence- posts” according to the values of x1, x2, . . . , xm. For example, if m = 4, t = 3, x1 =  001 2, x2 =  111 2, and x3 = x4 =  100 2, the desired order is  K1 < K15 < K3 < K5 < K7 < K19 < K21 < K9 < K11 < K13 < K17.   We could also let K21 precede K19.  A binary search for K2t+1+2j−3 in the subarray K1 < K3 < ··· < K2t+1−3 will now find the bits of xj from left to right. [See Fiat, Munro, Naor, Schäffer, Schmidt, and Siegel, J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 43  1991 , 406–424.]  SECTION 6.2.2 1. Use a header node, with say ROOT ≡ RLINK HEAD ; start the algorithm at step T4 with P ← HEAD. Step T5 should act as if K > KEY HEAD . [Thus, change lines 04 and 05 of Program T to ‘ENT1 ROOT; CMPA K’.] 2. In step T5, set RTAG Q  ← 1. Also, when inserting to the left, set RLINK Q  ← P; when inserting to the right, set RLINK Q  ← RLINK P  and RTAG P  ← 0. In step T4, change the test “RLINK P  ̸= Λ” to “RTAG P  = 0”. [If nodes are inserted into successively increasing locations Q, and if all deletions are last-in-first-out, the RTAG fields can be eliminated since RTAG P  will be 1 if and only if RLINK P  < P. Similar remarks apply with simultaneous left and right threading.] 3. We could replace Λ by a valid address, and set KEY Λ  ← K at the beginning of the algorithm; then the tests for LLINK or RLINK = Λ could be removed from the inner loop. However, in order to do a proper insertion we need to introduce another pointer variable that follows P; this can be done without losing the stated speed advantage, by duplicating the code as in Program 6.2.1F. Thus the MIX time would be reduced to about 5.5C units. 4. CN = 1+ 0·1+1·2+···+ n−1 2n−1+C′2n−1+···+C′N−1  N =  1+1 N C′N−1, for N ≥ 2n−1. The solution to these equations is C′N = 2 HN+1−H2n +n for N ≥ 2n−1, a savings of 2H2n − n − 2 ≈ n ln 4 − 1  comparisons. The actual improvement for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 is, respectively 0, 1 360360; thus comparatively little is gained 6, for small fixed n.

A comparison with the kth largest element will be made if and only if that element occurs before the mth and before all those between the kth and mth; this happens with probability 1  m−k+1 .

For example, each word x of the key could be replaced by ax mod m, where m is the computer word size and a is a random multiplier relatively prime to m. A value near to  ϕ−1 m can be recommended  see Section 6.4 . The flexible storage allocation of a tree method may make it more attractive than a hash coding scheme. 11.

Yes. In fact, the proof of Theorem H shows that if we delete the kth element inserted, for any fixed k, the result is random.  G. D. Knott [Ph.D. thesis, Stanford, 1975] showed that the result is random after an arbitrary sequence of random insertions followed by successive deletion of the  k1, . . . , kd th elements inserted, for any fixed sequence k1, . . . , kd.  14. Let NODE T  be on level k, and let LLINK T  = Λ, RLINK T  = R1, LLINK R1  = R2, . . . , LLINK Rd  = Λ, where Rd ̸= Λ and d ≥ 1. Let NODE Ri  have ni internal nodes in its right subtree, for 1 ≤ i ≤ d. With step D1.5 the internal path length decreases by k + d + n1 + ··· + nd; without that step it decreases by k + d + nd. 15. 11, 13, 25, 11, 12. [If aj is the  smallest, middle, largest  of {a1, a2, a3}, the tree   cid:113   cid:113  cid:64  is obtained  4, 2, 3  × 4 times after the deletion.]  19. 2HN−1−2N  16. Yes; even the deletion operation on permutations, as defined in the proof of Theorem H, is commutative  if we omit the renumbering aspect . If there is an element between X and Y, deletion is obviously commutative since the operation is affected only by the relative positions of X, Y, and their successors and there is no interaction between the deletion of X and the deletion of Y. On the other hand, if Y is the successor of X, and Y is the largest element, both orders of deletion have the effect of simply removing X and Y. If Y is the successor of X and Z the successor of Y, both orders of deletion have the effect of replacing the first occurrence of X, Y, or Z by Z and deleting the second and third occurrences of these elements within the permutation. 18. Use exercise 1.2.7–14.  k=1 k−1 θ kN θ = 2HN−1−2 θ+O N−θ . [The Pareto distribution 6.1– 13  also gives the same asymptotic result, to within O n−θ log n .] 20. Yes indeed. Assume that K1 < ··· < KN, so that the tree built by Algorithm T is degenerate; if, say, pk =  1 +   N + 1  2 − k ϵ  N, the average number of comparisons is  N + 1  2 −  N 2 − 1 ϵ 12, while the optimum tree requires fewer than ⌈lg N⌉ comparisons. 21. 1 20, 9 22. This is obvious when d = 2, and for d > 2 we had r[i, j−1] ≤ r[i+1, j−1] ≤ r[i+1, j]. 23.  8.  Most of the angles are 30◦, 60◦, or 90◦.   20, 3  20, 1  8, 3  [Increasing the weight of the first node will eventually make it move to the root position; this suggests that dynamically maintaining a perfectly optimum tree is hard.] 24. Let c be the cost of a tree obtained by deleting the nth node of an optimum tree. Then c 0, n−1  ≤ c ≤ c 0, n  − qn−1, since the deletion operation always moves n−1 up one level. Also c 0, n  ≤ c 0, n−1  + qn−1, since the stated replacement yields a tree of the latter cost. It follows that c 0, n−1  = c = c 0, n  − qn−1.  9   6.2.2  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  711  25.  a  Assume that A ≤ B and B ≤ C, and let a ∈ A, b ∈ B, c ∈ C, c < a. If c ≤ b then c ∈ B; hence c ∈ A and a ∈ B; hence a ∈ C. If c > b, then a ∈ B; hence a ∈ C and c ∈ B; hence c ∈ A.  b  Not hard to prove. 26. The cost of every tree has the form y + lx for some real y ≥ 0 and integer l > 0. The minimum of a finite number of such functions  taken over all trees  always has the form described. 27.  a  The answer to exercise 24  especially the fact that c = c 0, n−1   implies that R 0, n−1  = R 0, n  \ {n}.   b  If l = l′, the result in the hint is trivial. Otherwise let the paths to n be   cid:109 r0 ,  cid:109 r1 , . . . , rl  and  cid:109 s0 ,  cid:109 s1 , . . . , sl′ .  Since r = r0 > s0 = s and rl′   sk and rk+1 ≤ sk+1. We have rk+1 ∈ R rk, n , sk+1 ∈ R sk, n , and R sk, n  ≤ R rk, n  by induction, hence rk+1 ∈ R sk, n  and sk+1 ∈ R rk, n ; the result in the hint follows. Now to prove that R′h ≤ Rh, let r ∈ R′h, s ∈ Rh, s < r, and consider the optimum trees shown when x = xh; we must have l ≥ lh and we may assume that l′ = lh. To prove that Rh ≤ R′h+1, let r ∈ Rh, s ∈ R′h+1, s < r, and consider the optimum trees shown when x = xh+1; we must have l′ ≤ lh and we may assume that l = lh. 29. It is a degenerate tree  see exercise 5  with YOU at the top, THE at the bottom, needing 19.158 comparisons on the average.  Douglas A. Hamilton has proved that some degenerate tree is always worst. There-  fore an O n2  algorithm exists to find pessimal binary search trees. 30. See R. L. Wessner, Information Processing Letters 4  1976 , 90–94; F. F. Yao, SIAM J.

When M is large enough, the optimum tree must have the stated form and the minimum cost must be M times the minimum external path length plus the solution to the stated problem. [Notes: The paper by Wessner cited in answer 30 explains how to find optimum binary search trees of height ≤ L. In the special case p1 = ··· = pn = 0, the stated result is due to T. C. Hu and K. C. Tan, MRC Report 1111  Univ. of Wisconsin, 1970 . A. M. Garsia and M. L. Wachs proved that in this case all external nodes will appear on at most two levels if minn k=0 qk, and they presented an algorithm that needs only O n  steps to find an optimum two-level tree.] 33. For the stated problem, see A. Itai, SICOMP 5  1976 , 9–18. For the alternatives, see D. Spuler, Acta Informatica 31  1994 , 729–740. 34. It equals 2H p1,...,pn N 2πN  1−n  2 p1 . . . pn −1 2 1 + O 1 N  , if p1 . . . pn ̸= 0, by Stirling’s approximation. 35. The minimum value of the right-hand side occurs when 2x =  1 − p  p, and it equals 1 − p + H p, 1 − p . But H p, q, r  ≤ 1 − p + H p, 1 − p , by  20  with k = 2. 36. First we prove the hint, which is due to Jensen [Acta Math. 30  1906 , 175–193]. If f is concave, the function g p  = f px +  1 − p y  − pf x  −  1 − p f y  is concave and satisfies g 0  = g 1  = 0. If g p  < 0 and 0 < p < 1 there must be a value p0 < p with g′ p0    p with g′ p1  > 0, by the mean value theorem; but this contradicts concavity. Therefore f px +  1 − p y  ≥ pf x  +  1 − p f y  for 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, a fact that is also geometrically obvious. Now we can prove by induction  k=1 qk−1 + qk  ≥ maxn   m  712  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.2.2  that f p1x1 + ··· + pnxn  ≥ p1f x1  + ··· + pnf xn , since f p1x1 + ··· + pnxn  ≥ p1f x1  + ··· + pn−2f xn−2  +  pn−1 + pn f  pn−1xn−1 + pnxn   pn−1 + pn   if n > 2.

Thus the answer is  Hn − 1   ln 2.  This is lg n +  γ − 1   ln 2 + O n−1 , very near the maximum entropy H  1 n  = lg n. Therefore H p1, . . . , pn  is Ω log n  with high probability.  38. If sk−1 = sk we have qk−1 = pk = qk = 0; see  26 . Construct a tree for the n − 1 probabilities  p1, . . . , pk−1, pk+1, . . . , pn; q0, . . . , qk−1, qk+1, . . . , qn , and replace leaf k−1 by a 2-leaf subtree. 39. We can argue as in Theorem M, if 0 < w1 ≤ w2 ≤ ··· ≤ wn and sk = w1 +···+wk, because wk ≥ 2−t implies that sk−1 + 2−t ≤ sk ≤ sk+1 − 2−t when the weights are ordered; hence we have σk < 1 + lg 1 wk . [This result, together with the matching lower bound H w1, . . . , wn , was Theorem 9 in Shannon’s original paper of 1948.] 40. If k = s+3, the stated rearrangement changes the cost from qk−1l+ qkl+ qk−2lk−2 to qk−2l + qk−1l + qklk−2, so the net change is  qk−2 − qk  l − lk−2 ; this is negative if l   qk.  Similarly, if k ≥ s + 4 the rearrangement changes the cost by δ = qs+1 l − ls+1  + qs+2 l − ls+2  + qs+3 ls+1 − ls+3  + ··· + qk−2 lk−4 − lk−2   + qk−1 lk−3 − l  + qk lk−2 − l .  We have qs+1 > qs+3, qs+2 > qs+4, . . . , qk−2 > qk. Therefore we find δ ≤  qk−2 − qk  l − lk−2  +  qk−3 − qk−1  l − lk−3  ≤ 0;  for example, when k − s is even we have  δ ≤ qk−3 l − ls+1  + qk−2 l − ls+2  + qk−3 ls+1 − ls+3  + ··· + qk−2 lk−4 − lk−2   + qk−1 lk−3 − l  + qk lk−2 − l   and a similar derivation works when k − s is odd. It follows that δ is negative unless lk−2 = l. 41. E F G H T U X Y Z V W B C D A P Q R J K L M I N O S ␣. 42. Let qj = WT Pj .

Set the global variables t ← 0, m ← 2n, and invoke the recursive subroutine build 1 , where build l  means the following:  Set j ← m; if LEVEL Xt  = l then set LLINK Xj  ← Xt and t ← t + 1, if LEVEL Xt  = l then set RLINK Xj  ← Xt and t ← t + 1,  otherwise set m ← m − 1, LLINK Xj  ← Xm, and build l + 1 ; otherwise set m ← m − 1, RLINK Xj  ← Xm, and build l + 1 .  The variable j is local to the build routine. [This elegant solution is due to R. E.

Maintain the working array P0, . . . , Pt as a doubly linked list that also has the links of a balanced tree  see Section 6.2.3 . If the 2-descending weights are q0, . . . , qt, with qh at the root of the tree, we can decide whether to proceed left or right in the tree based on the values of qh and qh+1; the double linking provides instant access to qh+1.  No RANK fields are needed; rotation preserves symmetric order, so it does not require any changes to the double links.   Several families of weights for which the problem can be solved in O n  time have been presented by Hu and Morgenthaler, Lecture Notes in Comp.

B S  = 0 can happen only when S points to the root of the tree  it has never been changed in steps A3 or A4 , and all nodes from S to the point of insertion were balanced. 3. Let ρh be the largest possible ratio of unbalanced nodes in balanced trees of 2. We will prove that ρh =  Fh+1 −1   Fh+2 −1 . height h. Thus ρ1 = 0, ρ2 = 1 Let Th be a tree that maximizes ρh; then we may assume that its left subtree has height h − 1 and its right subtree has height h − 2, for if both subtrees had height h − 1 the ratio would be less than ρh−1. Thus the ratio for Th is at most  ρh−1Nl + ρh−2Nr + 1    Nl + Nr + 1 , where there are  Nl, Nr  nodes in the  left, right  subtree. This formula takes its maximum value when  Nl, Nr  take their minimum values; hence we may assume that Th is a Fibonacci tree. And ρh < ϕ − 1 by exercise 1.2.8–28. 4. When h = 7,  2, ρ3 = 1  has greater path length. [Note: C. C. Foster, Proc. ACM Nat.

It is difficult to insert a new node at the extreme left of the tree  ,  but K.-J. Räihä and S. H. Zweben have devised a general insertion algorithm that takes O log N  steps. [CACM 22  1979 , 508–512.] 21. Algorithm A does the job in order N log N steps  see exercise 5 ; the following algorithm creates the same trees in O N  steps, using an interesting iterative rendition of a recursive method. We use three auxiliary lists:  D1, . . . , Dl  a binary counter that essentially controls the recursion ; J1, . . . , Jl  a list of pointers to juncture nodes ; T1, . . . , Tl  a list of pointers to trees .  Here l = ⌈lg N +1 ⌉. For convenience the algorithm also sets D0 ← 1, J0 ← Jl+1 ← Λ.  G1. [Initialize.] Set l ← 0, J0 ← J1 ← Λ, D0 ← 1. G2. [Get next item.] Let P point to the next input node.  We may invoke another coroutine in order to obtain P.  If there is no more input, go to G5. Otherwise, set k ← 1, Q ← Λ, and interchange P ↔ J1.  G3. [Carry.] If k > l  or, equivalently, if P = Λ , set l ← l + 1, Dk ← 1, Tk ← Q, Jk+1 ← Λ, and return to G2. Otherwise set Dk ← 1− Dk, interchange Q ↔ Tk, P ↔ Jk+1, and increase k by 1. If now Dk−1 = 0, repeat this step. return to G2.  G4. [Concatenate.] Set LLINK P  ← Tk, RLINK P  ← Q, B P  ← 0, Tk ← P, and G5. [Finish up.] Set LLINK Jk  ← Tk, RLINK Jk  ← Jk−1, B Jk  ← 1 − Dk−1, for 1 ≤ k ≤ l. Then terminate the algorithm; Jl points to the root of the desired tree.  √ 2 external nodes.  Step G3 is executed 2N − ν N  times, where ν N  is the number of 1s in the binary representation of N. 22. The height of a weight-balanced tree with N internal nodes always lies between lg N + 1  and 2 lg N + 1 . To get this upper bound, note that the heavier subtree of the root has at most  N + 1   23.  a  Form a tree whose right subtree is a complete binary tree with 2n − 1 nodes, and whose left subtree is a Fibonacci tree with Fn+1 − 1 nodes.  b  Form a weight- balanced tree whose right subtree is about 2 lg N levels high and whose left subtree is about lg N levels high  see exercise 22 . 24. Consider a smallest tree that satisfies the condition but is not perfectly balanced. Then its left and right subtrees are perfectly balanced, so they have 2l and 2r external nodes, respectively, where l ̸= r. But this contradicts the stated condition. 25. After inserting a node at the bottom of the tree, we work up from the bottom to check the weight balance at each node on the search path. Suppose imbalance occurs at node A in  1 , after we have inserted a new node in the right subtree, where B and   718  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.2.3  its subtrees are weight-balanced. Then a single rotation will restore the balance unless √  α + β  γ > 2 + 1, where x denotes the number of external nodes in a tree x. [See SICOMP 2 But in this case it can be shown that a double rotation will suffice.  1973 , 33–43; N. Blum and K. Mehlhorn, Theoretical Comp. Sci. 11  1980 , 303–320.] 27. It is sometimes necessary to make two comparisons in nodes that contain two keys. The worst case occurs in a tree like the following, which sometimes needs 2 lg N +2 −2 comparisons:  7 N + 1  one-key nodes and 1  29. Partial solution by A. Yao: With N ≥ 6 keys the lowest level will contain an average of 2 7 N + 1  two-key nodes. The average total [Acta Informatica 9 number of nodes lies between 0.70N and 0.79N, for large N.  1978 , 159–170.] 30. For best-fit, arrange the records in order of size, with an arbitrary rule to break ties in case of equality.  See exercise 2.5–9.  For first fit, arrange the records in order of location, with an extra field in each node telling the size of the largest area in the subtree rooted at that node. This extra field can be maintained under insertions and deletions.  Although the running time is O log n , it probably still doesn’t beat the “ROVER” method of exercise 2.5–6 in practice; but the memory distribution may be better without ROVER, since there will usually be a nice large empty region for emergencies.   An improved method has been developed by R. P. Brent, ACM Trans. Prog.  Languages and Systems 11  1989 , 388–403. 31. Use a nearly balanced tree, with additional upward links for the leftmost part, plus a stack of postponed balance factor adjustments along this path.  Each insertion does a bounded number of these adjustments.   This problem can be generalized to require O log m  steps to find, insert, and or delete items that are m steps away from any given “finger,” where any key once located [See S. Huddleston and K. Mehlhorn, Acta can serve as a finger in later operations. Inf. 17  1982 , 157–184.] 32. Each right rotation increases one of the r’s and leaves the others unchanged; hence rk ≤ r′k is necessary. To show that it is sufficient, suppose rj = r′j for 1 ≤ j < k but rk < r′k. Then there is a right rotation that increases rk to a value ≤ r′k, because the numbers r1r2 . . . rn satisfy the condition of exercise 2.3.3–19 a . Notes: This partial ordering, first introduced by D. Tamari in 1951, has many interesting properties. Any two trees have a greatest lower bound T ∧ T ′, determined by the right-subtree sizes min r1, r′1  min r2, r′2  . . . min rn, r′n , as well as a least upper bound T ∨ T ′ determined by the left-subtree sizes min l1, l′1  min l2, l′2  . . . min ln, l′n . The left-subtree sizes are, of course, one less than the RANK fields of Algorithms B and C. For further information, see H. Friedman and D. Tamari, J.

First, we can reduce the storage to one bit A P  in each node P, so that B P  = A RLINK P   − A LLINK P   whenever LLINK P  and RLINK P  are both nonnull; oth- erwise B P  is known already. Moreover, we can assume that A P  = 0 whenever LLINK P  and RLINK P  are both null. Then A P  can be eliminated in all other nodes by swapping LLINK P  with RLINK P  whenever A P  = 1; a comparison of KEY P  with KEY LLINK P   or KEY RLINK P   will determine A P .  Of course, on machines for which pointers are always even, two unused bits are present already in every node. Further economies are possible as in exercise 2.3.1–37.  SECTION 6.2.4 1.

The worst case occurs if we have 1005 characters and the key to be passed to the parent must be 50 characters long: 445 chars + ptr + 50-char key + ptr + 50-char key + ptr + 445 chars.

This underflow operation will fail only if the sibling was minimally full, but in that case the two nodes can be collapsed into one  together with one key from their parent ; such collapsing may cause the parent in turn to underflow, etc. With variable-length keys as in exercise 5, a parent node may need to split when one of its keys becomes longer. 8. Given a tree T with N internal nodes, let there be a external nodes that require k accesses and whose parent node belongs to a page containing j keys; and let A j  z  be the corresponding generating function. Thus A 1  1  + ··· + A M  1  = N + 1.  Note is a multiple of j + 1, for 1 ≤ j < M.

The subscript M M denotes the lower right corner element of the matrix.  Now W = S−1 diag  λ1, . . . , λM S, for some matrix S, where diag  λ1, . . . , λM  denotes the diagonal matrix whose entries are the roots of χ λ  =  λ+2  . . .  λ+M+1 − M+1 !.  The roots are distinct, since χ λ  = χ′ λ  = 0 implies 1  λ+2 +··· +1  λ+M +1  = 0; the latter can hold only when λ is real, and −M − 1 < λ < −2, which implies that λ + 2 . . .λ + M + 1 <  M + 1 !, a contradiction.  If p x  is any polynomial, p W   = p S−1 diag  λ1, . . . , λM S  = S−1 diag  p λ1 , . . . , p λM  S; hence the lower right corner element of p W   has the form c1p λ1  +··· + cM p λM  for some constants c1, . . . , cM independent of p. These constants may be evaluated by setting p λ  = χ λ   λ−λj ; since  W k MM =  −2 k for 0 ≤ k ≤ M−1, we have p W  MM = p −2  =  M +1 !  λj +2  = cjp λj  = cjχ′ λj  = cj M +1 !  1  λj +2 +···+1  λj + M +1  ; hence cj =  λj + 2 −1 1  λj + 2  + ··· + 1  λj + M + 1  −1. This yields an “explicit” j=1 2cjfN λj ; and it remains to study the roots λj. Note that λj+M +1 ≤ M +1 for all j, otherwise we would have λj+2 . . .λj+M +1 >  M +1 !. Taking λ1 = 0, this implies that ℜ λj  < 0 for 2 ≤ j ≤ M. By Eq. 1.2.5– 15 , gn x  ∼  n + 1 x Γ  x + 2  as n → ∞; hence gn λj  → 0 for 2 ≤ j ≤ M.

Algorithms 10  1989 , 52–75], who discovered that the variance of the storage utilization undergoes a sur- prising phase transition: When M ≤ 25, the variance is Θ N ; but when M ≥ 26 it is asymptotically f N N 1+2α where f eπ βN  = f N , if − 1 2 + α − βi are the nonzero roots λj with largest real part. The height of such trees has been analyzed by L. Devroye [Random Structures & Algorithms 1  1990 , 191–203]; see also B. Pittel, Random Structures & Algorithms 5  1994 , 337–347. 9. Yes; for example we could replace each Ki in  1  by i plus the number of keys in subtrees P0, . . . , Pi−1. The search, insertion, and deletion algorithms can be modified appropriately. 10. Brief sketch: Extend the paging scheme so that exclusive access to buffers is given to one user at a time; the search, insertion, and deletion algorithms must be carefully modified so that such exclusive access is granted only for a limited time when absolutely necessary, and in such a way that no deadlocks can occur. For details, see B. Samadi, Inf. Proc. Letters 5  1976 , 107–112; R. Bayer and M. Schkolnick, Acta Inf. 9  1977 , 1–21; Y. Sagiv, J. Comp. Syst. Sci. 33  1986 , 275–296.  SECTION 6.3 1. Lieves  the plural of “lief” . 2. Perform Algorithm T using the new key as argument; it will terminate unsuccess- fully in either step T3 or T4. If in T3, simply set table entry k of NODE P  to K and terminate the insertion algorithm. Otherwise set this table entry to the address of a new node Q ⇐ AVAIL, containing only null links, then set P ← Q. Now set k and k′ to the respective next characters of K and X; if k ̸= k′, store K in position k of NODE P  and store X in position k′, but if k = k′ again make the k position point to a new node Q ⇐ AVAIL, set P ← Q, and repeat the process until eventually k ̸= k′.  We must assume that no key is a prefix of another.  3. Replace the key by a null link, in the node where it appears. If this node is now useless because all its entries are null except one that is a key X, delete the node and replace the corresponding pointer in its parent by X. If the parent node is now useless, delete it in the same way. 4. Successful searches take place exactly as with the full table, but unsuccessful searches in the compressed table may go through several additional iterations. For example, an input argument such as TRASH will make Program T take six iterations  more than five! ; this is the worst case. It is necessary to verify that no infinite looping on blank sequences is possible.  This remarkable 49-place packing is due to J. Scot Fishburn, who also showed that 48 places do not suffice.   A slower but more versatile way to economize on trie storage has been proposed  by Kurt Maly, CACM 19  1976 , 409–415.  In general, if we want to compress n sparse tables containing respectively x1, . . . , xn nonzero entries, a first-fit method that offsets the jth table by the minimum   722  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.3  amount rj that will not conflict with the previously placed tables will have rj ≤  x1 + ··· + xj−1 xj, since each previous nonzero entry can block at most xj offsets. This worst-case estimate gives rj ≤ 93 for the data in Table 1, guaranteeing that any twelve tables of length 30 containing respectively 10, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2 nonzero entries can be packed into 93 + 30 consecutive locations regardless of the pattern of the nonzeros. Further refinements of this method have been developed by R. E. Tarjan and A. C. Yao, CACM 22  1979 , 606–611. A dynamic implementation of compressed tries, due to F. M. Liang, is used for hyphenation tables in the TEX typesetting system. [See D. E. Knuth, CACM 29  1986 , 471–478; Literate Programming  1992 , 206–233.] 5. In each family, test for the most probable outcome first, by arranging the letters from left to right in decreasing order of probability. The optimality of this arrangement can be proved as in Theorem 6.1S. [See CACM 12  1969 , 72–76.]  6.  7. For example, 8, 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15.  No matter what sequence is used, the left subtree cannot contain more than two nodes on level 4, nor can the right subtree.  Even this “worst” tree is within 4 of the best possible tree, so we see that digital search trees aren’t very sensitive to the order of insertion. 8. Yes. The KEY fields now contain only a truncated key; leading bits implied by the node position are chopped off.  A similar modification of Algorithm T is possible.  9.

For random data, the approximate average running times are therefore:  Program 6.2.2T This program  Successful  15 ln N − 12.34 14.4 ln N − 6.17  Unsuccessful 15 ln N − 2.34 14.4 ln N + 1.26   Consequently Program 6.2.2T is a shade faster unless N is very large.  10. Let ⊕ denote the exclusive or operation on n-bit numbers, and let f x  = n − ⌈lg x + 1 ⌉ be the number of leading zero bits of x. One solution:  b  If a search via Algorithm T ends unsuccessfully in step T3, K is one less than the number of bit inspections made so far; otherwise if the search ends in step T4, k = f K ⊕ X .  a, c  Do a regular search, but also keep track of the minimum value, x, of K ⊕ KEY P  over all KEY P  compared with K during the search. Then k = f x .  Prove that no other key can have more bits in common with K than those compared to K. In case  a , the maximum k occurs for either the largest key ≤ K or the smallest key > K.  11. No; eliminating a node with only one empty subtree will “forget” one bit in the keys of the nonempty subtree. To delete a node, we should replace it by one of its terminal descendants, for example by searching to the right whenever possible. 12. Insert three random numbers α, β, γ between 0 and 1 into an initially empty tree; then delete α with probability p, β with probability q, γ with probability r, using the algorithm suggested in the previous exercise. The tree  2 q + 1  4 p + 1  2 only if p = 0.  2 r, and this is 1  is obtained with probability 1 13. Add a KEY field to each node, and compare K with this key before looking at the vector element in step T2. Table 1 would change as follows: Nodes  1 , . . . ,  12  would contain the respective keys THE, AND, BE, FOR, HIS, IN, OF, TO, WITH, HAVE, HE, THAT  if we inserted them in order of decreasing frequency , and these keys would be deleted from their previous positions. [The corresponding program would be slower and more complicated than Program T, in this case. A more direct M-ary generalization of Algorithm D would create a tree with N nodes, having one key and M links per node.] 14. If j ≤ n, there is only one place, namely KEY P . But if j > n, the set of all occurrences is found by traversing the subtree of node P: If there are r occurrences, this subtree contains r−1 nodes  including node P , and so it has r link fields with TAG = 1; these link fields point to all the nodes that reference TEXT positions matching K.  It isn’t necessary to check the TEXT again at all.  15. To begin forming the tree, set KEY HEAD  to the first TEXT reference, and set LLINK HEAD  ← HEAD, LTAG HEAD  ← 1. Further TEXT references can be entered into the tree using the following insertion algorithm:  Set K to the new key that we wish to enter.   This is the first reference the insertion algorithm makes to the TEXT array.  Perform Algorithm P; it must terminate unsuccessfully, since no key is allowed to be a prefix of another.  Step P6 makes the second reference to the TEXT; no more references will be needed!  Now suppose that the key located in step P6 agrees with the argument K in the first l bits, but differs   724  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.3  from it in position l + 1, where K has the digit b and the key has 1 − b.  Even though the search in Algorithm P might have let j get much greater than l, it is possible to prove that the procedure specified here will find the longest match between K and any existing key. Thus, all keys of the text that start with the first l bits of K have 1 − b as their  l + 1 st bit.  Now repeat Algorithm P with K replaced by these leading l bits  thus, n ← l . This time the search will be successful, so we needn’t perform step P6. Now set R ⇐ AVAIL, KEY R  ← position of the new key in TEXT. If LLINK Q  = P, set LLINK Q  ← R, t ← LTAG Q , LTAG Q  ← 0; otherwise set RLINK Q  ← R, t ← RTAG Q , RTAG Q  ← 0. If b = 0, set LTAG R  ← 1, LLINK R  ← R, RTAG R  ← t, RLINK R  ← P; otherwise set RTAG R  ← 1, RLINK R  ← R, LTAG R  ← t, LLINK R  ← P. If t = 1, set SKIP R  ← 1+ l−j; otherwise set SKIP R  ← 1+ l−j+SKIP P  and SKIP P  ← j−l−1. 16. The tree setup requires precisely one dotted link coming from below a node to that node; it comes from that part of the tree where this key first differs from all others. If there is no such part of the tree, the algorithms break down. We could simply drop keys that are prefixes of others, but then the algorithm of exercise 14 wouldn’t have enough data to find all occurrences of the argument. 17.

To solve  4  we need the transform of an = [n > 1], namely ˆan = [n = 0] − 1 + n; hence for N ≥ 2 we obtain AN = 1 − UN + VN, where UN = K N, 0, M  and VN = K N, 1, M  in the notation of exercise 19. Similarly, to solve  5 , take an = n−[n = 1] = ˆan and obtain CN = N + VN for N ≥ 2. 19. For s = 1, we have Vn = K n, 1, m  = n  ln n + γ  ln m − 1 2 − δ0 n − 1   + O 1 , and for s ≥ 2 we have K n, s, m  =  −1 sn 1 ln m + δs−1 n − s   s s − 1  + O 1 , where  ℜ Γ  s − 2πik ln m  exp 2πik logm n    is a periodic function of log n.

Let there be AN nodes in all. The number of nonnull pointers is AN − 1, and the number of nonpointers is N, so the total number of null pointers is M AN − AN +1− N. To get the average number of null pointers in any fixed position, divide by M. [The average value of AN appears in exercise 20 a .] 22. There is a node for each of the M l sequences of leading bits such that at least two keys have this bit pattern. The probability that exactly k keys have a particular bit pattern is   N    k  M−lk 1 − M−l N−k,  so the average number of trie nodes on level l is M l 1− 1− M−l N − N 1− M−l N−1. 23. More generally, consider the case of arbitrary s as in exercise 20. If there are al nodes on level l, they contain al+1 links and M al − al+1 places where the search might be unsuccessful.

Taking q = 1 1  3·7 +1  3·7·15 −··· = 0.28879; it’s slightly faster to use z = − 1 4 and take half of the result. Alternatively, Euler’s formula from exercise 5.1.1–14 can be used, involving only negative powers of 2.

The hash function is bad since it assumes at most 26 different values, and some of them occur much more often than the others. Even with double hashing  letting h2 K  = 1 plus the second byte of K, say, and M = 101  the search will be slowed down more than the time saved by faster hashing. Also M = 100 is too small, since FORTRAN programs often have more than 100 distinct variables. 6. Not on MIX, since arithmetic overflow will almost always occur  dividend too large .

The strong induction hypotheses can be supplemented by the fact that { −1 k rqk + qk−1 θ} =  −1 k r qkθ − pk  +  qk−1θ − pk−1   for 0 ≤ r ≤ ak. The “record low” values of {nθ} occur for n = q1, q2 + q1, 2q2 + q1, . . . , a2q2 + q1 = 0q4 + q3, q4 + q3, . . . , a4q4 + q3 = 0q6 + q5, . . . ; the “record high” values occur for n = q0, q1 + q0, . . . , a1q1 + q0 = 0q3 + q2, . . . . These are the steps when interval number 0 of a new length is formed. [Further structure can be deduced by generalizing the Fibonacci number system of exercise 1.2.8–34; see L. H. Ramshaw, J.

Let θ =   a1, a2, . . .    and θk =   ak+1, ak+2, . . .   , and let Qk = qk + qk−1θk−2 in the notation of exercise 8. If a1 > 2, the very first break is bad. The three sizes of intervals in exercise 8 are, respectively,  1 − rθk−1  Qk, θk−1 Qk, and  1 −  r − 1 θk−1  Qk, so the ratio of the first length to the second is  ak − r  + θk. This will be less than 1 2 when r = ak and ak+1 ≥ 2; hence {a2, a3, . . .} must all equal 1 if there are to be no bad breaks. [For related theorems, see R. L. Graham and J. H. van Lint, Canadian J.

If keys were required to be nonzero as in Program L, this change would be worthwhile, and we could also represent empty positions by 0. 12.

An inner loop shouldn’t always be optimized!  13. Let the table entries be of two distinguishable types, as in Algorithm C, with an additional one-bit TAG[i] field in each entry. This solution uses circular lists, following a suggestion of Allen Newell, with TAG[i] = 1 in the first word of each list.   730  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.4  A1. [Initialize.] Set i ← j ← h K  + 1, Q ← q K . A2. [Is there a list?] If TABLE[i] is empty, set TAG[i] ← 1 and go to A8. Otherwise  if TAG[i] = 0, go to A7.  A3. [Compare.] If Q = KEY[i], the algorithm terminates successfully. A4. [Advance to next.] If LINK[i] ̸= j, set i ← LINK[i] and go back to A3. A5. [Find empty node.] Decrease R one or more times until finding a value such that TABLE[R] is empty. If R = 0, the algorithm terminates with overflow; otherwise set LINK[i] ← R.  A6. [Prepare to insert.] Set i ← R, TAG[R] ← 0, and go to A8. A7. [Displace a record.] Repeatedly set i ← LINK[i] one or more times until LINK[i] = j. Then do step A5. Then set TABLE[R] ← TABLE[j], i ← j, TAG[j] ← 1.  A8. [Insert new key.] Mark TABLE[i] as an occupied node, with KEY[i] ← Q,  LINK[i] ← j.   Note that if TABLE[i] is occupied it is possible to determine the corresponding full key K, given only the value of i. We have q K  = KEY[i], and then if we set i ← LINK[i] zero or more times until TAG[i] = 1 we will have h K  = i − 1.  14. According to the stated conventions, the notation “X ⇐ AVAIL” of 2.2.3– 6  now stands for the following operations: “Set X ← AVAIL; then set X ← LINK X  zero or more times until either X = Λ  an OVERFLOW error  or TAG X  = 0; finally set AVAIL ← LINK X .” To insert a new key K: Set Q ⇐ AVAIL, TAG Q  ← 1, and store K in this word. [Alternatively, if all keys are short, omit this and substitute K for Q in what follows.] Then set R ⇐ AVAIL, TAG R  ← 1, AUX R  ← Q, LINK R  ← Λ. Set P ← h K , and  if TAG P  = 0, set TAG P  ← 2, AUX P  ← R; if TAG P  = 1, set S ⇐ AVAIL, CONTENTS S  ← CONTENTS P , TAG P  ← 2,  AUX P  ← R, LINK P  ← S;  if TAG P  = 2, set LINK R  ← AUX P , AUX P  ← R.  To retrieve a key K: Set P ← h K , and  if TAG P  ̸= 2, K is not present; if TAG P  = 2, set P ← AUX P ; then set P ← LINK P  zero or more times until either P = Λ, or TAG P  = 1 and either AUX P  = K  if all keys are short  or AUX P  points to a word containing K  perhaps indirectly through words with TAG = 2 .  Elcock’s original scheme [Comp. J. 8  1965 , 242–243] actually used TAG = 2 and TAG = 3 to distinguish between lists of length one  when we can save one word of space  and longer lists. This is a worthwhile improvement, since we presumably have such a large hash table that almost all lists have length one.  Another way to place a hash table “on top of” a large linked memory, using coalescing lists instead of separate chaining, has been suggested by J. S. Vitter [Inf. Proc. Letters 13  1981 , 77–79]. 15. Knowing that there is always an empty node makes the inner search loop faster, since we need not maintain a counter to determine how many times step L2 is per- formed. The shorter program amply compensates for this one wasted cell. [On the   6.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  731  other hand, there is a neat way to avoid the variable N and to allow the table to become completely full, in Algorithm L, without slowing down the method appreciably except when the table actually does overflow: Simply check whether i < 0 happens twice! This trick does not apply to Algorithm D.] 16. No: 0 always leads to SUCCESS, whether it has been inserted or not, and SUCCESS occurs with different values of i at different times. 17. The second probe would then always be to position 0. 18. The code in  31  costs about 3 A − S1  units more than  30 , and it saves 4u times the difference between  26 ,  27 , and  28 ,  29 . For a successful search,  31  is advantageous only when the table is more than about 94 percent full, and it never saves more than about 1 2 u of time. For an unsuccessful search,  31  is advantageous when the table is more than about 71 percent full. 20. We want to show that   modulo 2m   and  1 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ 2m   j  2   ≡ k    2  3  implies j = k. Observe that the congruence j j − 1  ≡ k k − 1   modulo 2m+1  implies  k − j  k + j − 1  ≡ 0. If k − j is odd, k + j − 1 must be a multiple of 2m+1, but that’s impossible since 2 ≤ k + j − 1 ≤ 2m+1 − 2. Hence k − j is even, so k + j − 1 is odd, so k − j is a multiple of 2m+1, so k = j. [Conversely, if M is not a power of 2, this probe sequence does not work.]   M 2 C−1 − A−S1  units since B ≈C+1  The probe sequence has secondary clustering, and it increases the running time of  Program D  as modified in  30   by about 1 will now be negligible. This is a small improvement, until the table gets about 60 percent full. 21. If N is decreased, Algorithm D can fail since it might reach a state with no empty spaces and loop indefinitely. On the other hand, if N isn’t decreased, Algorithm D might signal overflow when there still is room. The latter alternative is the lesser of the two evils, because rehashing can be used to get rid of deleted cells.  In the latter case Algorithm D should increase N and test for overflow only when inserting an item into a previously empty position, since N represents the number of nonempty positions.  We could also maintain two counters. 22. Suppose that positions j − 1, j − 2, . . . , j − k are occupied and j − k − 1 is empty  modulo M . The keys that probe position j and find it occupied before being inserted are precisely those keys in positions j − 1 through j − k whose hash address does not lie between j − 1 and j − k; such problematical keys appear in the order of insertion. Algorithm R moves the first such key into position j, and repeats the process on a smaller range of problematical positions until no problematical keys remain. 23. A deletion scheme for coalesced chaining devised by J. S. Vitter [J. Algorithms 3  1982 , 261–275] preserves the distribution of search times. 24.

Conversely, if p1p2 . . . pn exists, let q1q2 . . . qn be the inverse permutation  qi = j if and only if pj = i , and let bi be the number of aj that equal i. Every car will be parked if we can prove that bn ≤ 1, bn−1 + bn ≤ 2, etc.; equivalently b1 ≥ 1, b1 + b2 ≥ 2, etc. But this is clearly true, since the k elements aq1, . . . , aqk are all ≤ k.

Many interesting connections are possible, and the following three are the author’s favorites [see also Foata and Riordan, Æquat. Math. 10  1974 , 10–22]:   6.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  733  a  In the notation of the previous answer, the counts b1, b2, . . . , bn correspond to a full parking sequence if and only if  b1, b2, . . . , bn, 0  is a valid sequence of degrees of tree nodes in preorder.  Compare with 2.3.3– 9 , which illustrates postorder.  Every such tree corresponds to n! b1! . . . bn! distinct labeled free trees on {0, . . . , n}, since we can let 0 be the label of the root, and for k = 1, 2, . . . , n we can successively choose the labels of the children of the kth node in preorder in  bk +··· + bn ! bk!  bk+1 +··· + bn ! ways from the remaining unused labels, attaching labels from left to right in increasing order. And every such sequence of counts corresponds to n! b1! . . . bn! wakeup sequences.  b  Dominique Foata has given the following pretty one-to-one correspondence: Let a1 . . . an be a safe parking sequence, which leaves car qj parked in space j. A labeled free tree on {0, 1, . . . , n} is constructed by drawing a line from j to 0 when aj = 1, and from j to qaj−1 otherwise, for 1 ≤ j ≤ n.  Think of the tree nodes as cars; car j is connected to the car that eventually winds up parked just before where wife j woke up.  For example, the wakeup times 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 lead to the free tree   cid:114 2 cid:114   cid:114 0  cid:0  cid:0    cid:64  cid:64  4   cid:114   cid:114 7  cid:114   1   cid:114 9  cid:114 6 cid:114   cid:114   8   cid:0  cid:0   cid:64  cid:64  3 5  by Foata’s rule. Conversely, the sequence of parked cars may be obtained from the tree by topological sorting, assuming that arrows emanate from the root 0 and choosing the smallest “source” at each step. From this sequence, a1 . . . an can be reconstructed.  c  First construct an auxiliary tree by letting the parent of node k be the first element > k that follows k in the permutation q1 . . . qn; if there’s no such element, let the parent be 0. Then make a copy of the auxiliary tree and relabel the nonzero nodes of the new tree by proceeding as follows, in preorder: If the label of the current node was k in the auxiliary tree, swap its current label with the label that is currently  1 + pk − ak th smallest in its subtree. For example,  auxiliary tree  final tree   cid:114 6 cid:114   cid:114 0  cid:0  cid:0    cid:64  cid:64  9   cid:114    cid:114   8  7   cid:114    cid:114 3  cid:114 1 cid:114   cid:114   2   cid:0  cid:0   cid:64  cid:64  5 4   cid:114 6 cid:114   cid:114 0  cid:0  cid:0    cid:64  cid:64  4   cid:114    cid:114   2  8   cid:114    cid:114 3  cid:114 5 cid:114   cid:114   7   cid:0  cid:0   cid:64  cid:64  1 9  To reverse the procedure, we can reconstruct the auxiliary tree by proceeding in preorder to swap the label of each node with the largest label currently in its subtree. Constructions  a  and  b  are strongly related, but construction  c  is quite dif- ferent. It has the interesting property that the sum of displacements of cars from their preferred locations is equal to the number of inversions in the tree — the number of pairs of labels a > b where a is an ancestor of b. This relation between parking sequences and tree inversions was first discovered by G. Kreweras [Periodica Math. Hung. 11  1980 , 309–320]. The fact that tree inversions are intimately related to connected graphs [Mallows and Riordan, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 74  1968 , 92–94] now makes D p  =  p1 − a1  + ··· +  pn − an , is equal to the total number of connected graphs with n + k edges on the labeled vertices {0, 1, . . . , n}. [See equations  2.11 ,  3.5 , and  it possible to deduce that the sum of D p    taken over all parking sequences, where  k   734  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  6.4   8.13  in the paper by Janson, Łuczak, Knuth, and Pittel, Random Struct. & Alg. 4  1993 , 233–358.] 32. Let  j  k=0  sj =   bk mod M − 1 .  k  k  PN k =  k aknk mk.  Then, as observed by Svante Janson, we have cj = maxk≥j sk − sj , a quantity that is well defined because limk→∞ sk = −∞. The solution can be found by defining cM−1, cM−2, . . . on the assumption that c0 = 0; then if c0 turns out to be greater than 0, it suffices to redefine cM−1, cM−2, . . . until no more changes are made. 33. The individual probabilities are not independent, since the condition b0 +b1 +···+ bM−1 = N was not taken into account; the derivation allows a nonzero probability that imply, for example, that qk is positive for all k, contradicting the fact that cj can never exceed N − 1.   bj has any given nonnegative value.

When α = 1 this is about 2.65, so the standard deviation is bounded by 1.63. [Svante Janson, in Combinatorics, Prob. and Comp. 17  2008 , 799– 814, has found the asymptotic moments of all orders, also when the search is successful.] 41. Let VN be the average length of the block of occupied cells at the “high” end of the table. The probability that this block has length k is AN k M − 1 − k N−k M N, where AN k is the number of hash sequences  35  such that Algorithm C leaves the first N − k and the last k cells occupied and such that the subsequence 1 2 . . . N−k appears in increasing order. Therefore  = M N+1 −  M − N   k M − k AN k M − 1 − k N−k k AN k M − k N−k = M N+1 −  M − N  M + 1 N . Now TN =  N M  1+VN −T0−···−TN−1 , since T0+···+TN−1 is the average number of times R has previously decreased and N M is the probability that it decreases on the current step. The solution to this recurrence is TN =  N M  1 + 1 M N.  Such a simple formula deserves a simpler proof!  42. S1N is the number of items that were inserted with A = 0, divided by N. 43. Let N = αM′ and M = βM′, and let e−λ + λ = 1 β, ρ = α β. Then CN ≈ 1+ 1 2 ρ and C′N ≈ ρ+e−ρ, if ρ ≤ λ; CN ≈ 1 4 ρ+2λ−λ2 ρ  2 ρ− λ , if ρ ≥ λ. For α = 1 we get the and C′N ≈ 1 β + 1 smallest CN ≈ 1.69 when β ≈ .853; the smallest C′N ≈ 1.79 occurs when β ≈ .782. The setting β = .86 gives near-optimal search performance for a wide range of α. So it pays to put the first collisions into an area that doesn’t conflict with hash addresses, even though a smaller range of hash addresses will cause more collisions to occur. These results are due to Jeffrey S. Vitter, JACM 30  1983 , 231–258. 44.  The following brute-force approach was the solution found by the author in 1972; a much more elegant solution by M. S. Paterson is explained in Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms by Greene and Knuth  Birkhäuser Boston, 1980 , §3.4. Paterson also found significant ways to simplify several other analyses in this section.    sequences of operations with k “p steps” and n− k “q steps” to be equally likely,  times the probability that the first r − 1 positions become  alln let g m, n+1, k, r  be n  Number the positions of the array from 1 to m, left to right.

This method is inferior to those described in the text, but it is of historical importance because it suggested Morris’s method, which led to Algorithm D. See CACM 6  1963 , 101, where M. D.

The keys can be stored in a separate table, allocated sequentially  assuming that deletions, if any, are LIFO . The hash table entries point to this “names table”; for example, TABLE[i] might have the form  1−α − 1  α ln 1  Li KEY[i] ,  where Li is the number of words in the key stored at locations KEY[i], KEY[i] + 1, . . . . The rest of the hash table entry might be used in any of several ways:  i  as a link for Algorithm C;  ii  as part of the information associated with the key; or  iii  as a “secondary hash code.” The latter idea, suggested by Robert Morris, sometimes speeds up a search [we take a careful look at the key in KEY[i] only if h2 K  matches its secondary hash code, for some function h2 K ]. 66. Yes; and the arrangement of the records is unique. The average number of probes per unsuccessful search is reduced to CN−1, although it remains C′N when the Nth term is inserted. This important technique is called ordered hashing. See Comp. J. 17  1974 , 135–142; D. E. Knuth, Literate Programming  1992 , 144–149, 216–217. 67.  a  If cj = 0 in  44 , an optimum arrangement is obtained by sorting the a’s into nonincreasing “cyclic order,” assuming that j − 1 > ··· > 0 > M − 1 > ··· > j.  b  Between steps L2 and L3, exchange the record-in-hand with TABLE[i] if the latter is closer to home than the former.

The Robin Hood and last-come-first-served techniques apply to double hashing as well as to linear probing, but the reduction in probes does not compensate for the increased time per probe with respect to double hashing unless the table is extremely full.  See Poblete and Munro, J. Algorithms 10  1989 , 228–248.  68.

Hence the expected list size is ≤ 1 +  N − 1  M.   b  Suppose there are Q possible characters; then there are M Q possible choices for each hj. Choosing each hj at random is equivalent to choosing a random row from a matrix H of M Ql rows and Ql columns, with the entry h x1 . . . xl  =  h1 x1  + ··· + hl xl   mod M in column x1 . . . xl. In columns K = x1 . . . xl and K′ = x′1 . . . x′l with xj ̸= x′j for some j, we have h K  =  s + hj xj   mod M and h K′  =  s′ + hj x′j   i̸=j hi x′i  are independent of hj. The value of hj xj  − hj x′j  is uniformly distributed modulo M; hence we have h K  = h K′  with probability 1 M, regardless of the values of s and s′.  i̸=j hi xi  and s′ =  mod M, where s =   c  Yes; adding any constant to hj xj  changes h x  by a constant, modulo M.  73.  i  This is the special case of exercise 72 c  when each key is regarded as a sequence of bits, not characters. [It was invented as early as 1970 by Alfred L. Zobrist, whose original technical report has been reprinted in ICCA Journal 13  1990 , 69–73.]  ii  The proof of  b  shows that it suffices to show that hj xj  − hj x′j  is uniform modulo M when xj ̸= x′j. And in fact, the probability that hj xj  = y and hj x′j  = y′ is 1 M 2, for any given y and y′, because the congruences ajxj + bj ≡ y and ajx′j + bj ≡ y′ have a unique solution  aj, bj  for any given  y, y′ , modulo the prime M. When M is not prime and p is a prime > M, a similar result holds if we let hj xj  =   ajxj + bj  mod p  mod M, where aj and bj are chosen randomly mod p. In this case the family is not quite universal, but it comes close enough for practical   6.4  ANSWERS TO EXERCISES  743  √  N  purposes: The probability that different keys collide is at most 1 M + r M − r  M p2 ≤ 1 M + M 4p2, where r = p mod M. 74.

Consider letting h x1 . . . xl  = h1 x1 , where h1 is chosen at random. This family of hash functions makes the expected size of every list N M; yet it is certainly not universal, because a set of N keys that have the same first character x1 will lead to one list of size N and all other lists empty. The expected number of collisions will be N N −1  2, but with a universal hash family this number is at most N N − 1  2M, regardless of the set of keys.   M, namely  1 4 + N N − 1   contains at least zh2  ≤N R  On the other hand we can show that the expected size of every list is O 1  + √ M   in a universal family.

Then the quantities hj xj  + hk xk , hj xj  + hk x′k , and hj x′′j   + hk x′k  are independent of each other, uniformly distributed, and independent of the other l − 2 characters of the keys.  d  False. Consider, for example, the case M = l = 2 with 1-bit characters. Then all four keys hash to the same location with probability 1 4. 76.

Generate the random coefficients for hj  and, if desired, precompute its array of values  when a key of length ≥ j occurs for the first time. Since l is unbounded, the matrix H is infinite; but only a finite portion is relevant in any particular program run. 77. Let p ≤ 2−16 be the probability that two 32-bit keys have the same image under H. The worst case occurs when two given keys agree in seven of their eight 32-bit subkeys; then the probability of collision is 1− 1−p 4 < 4p. [See Wegman and Carter, J. Comp. Syst.

If c such changes are made, the path ends at  m, n − 2t + 2c , where c ≥ 0 and c ≥ 2t − n; hence n − 2t + 2c ≥ n − 2k. In the permutation corresponding to the changed path, the smallest c elements of list B correspond to the downward steps that changed, and list A contains the t− c elements corresponding to downward steps that didn’t change.

The construction used here is a disguised form of a more general construction by which N. G. de Bruijn, C. van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen, and D. Kruyswijk [Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde  2  23  1951 , 191–193] proved the multiset generalization of Sperner’s Theorem: “Let M be a multiset containing n elements  counting multiplicities . The collection of all ⌊n 2⌋-element submultisets of M is the largest possible collection such that no submultiset is contained in another.” For example, the largest such collection when M = {a, a, b, b, c, c} consists of the seven submultisets {a, a, b}, {a, a, c}, {a, b, b}, {a, b, c}, {a, c, c}, {b, b, c}, {b, c, c}. This would correspond to seven permutations of six attributes A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3 in which all queries involving Ai also involve Bi. Further comments appear in a paper by C. Greene and D. J.

Therefore ft s, m  is the minimum of ft s0, m−1 +ft−1 s0, m−1 +ft−1 s1, m−1  over all s0 and s1 such that 2m−1 ≥ s0 ≥ s1 ≥ 0 and s0+s1 = s. To prove that the minimum occurs for s0 = ⌈s 2⌉ and s1 = ⌊s 2⌋, we can use induction on m, the result being clear for m = 1: Given m ≥ 2, let gt s  = ft s, m − 1  and ht s  = ft s, m − 2 . Then, by induction, gt s0  + gt−1 s0  + gt−1 s1  = ht ⌈s0 2⌉  + ht−1 ⌈s0 2⌉  + ht−1 ⌊s0 2⌋  + ht−1 ⌈s0 2⌉ +ht−2 ⌈s0 2⌉ +ht−2 ⌊s0 2⌋ +ht−1 ⌈s1 2⌉ +ht−2 ⌈s1 2⌉ +ht−2 ⌊s1 2⌋ , which is ≥ gt ⌈s0 2⌉ +⌈s1 2⌉  + gt−1 ⌈s0 2⌉ +⌈s1 2⌉  + gt−1 ⌊s0 2⌋ +⌊s1 2⌋ . And if s0 > s1+1, we have ⌈s0 2⌉+⌈s1 2⌉ < s0, except in the case s0 = 2k+1 and s1 = 2k−1. In the latter case, however, gt s0  + gt−1 s0  + gt−1 s1  ≥ ht 2k + 1  + 2ht−1 2k  ≥ ht 2k  + 2ht−1 2k .  b  Observe that the set S containing the numbers 0, 1, . . . , s − 1 in binary notation has the property that S0 ∪ S1 = S0, and S0 contains ⌈s0 2⌉ elements.

The pairs missing in K′ are {z, x2}, {x2, y2}, {y2, x3}, {x3, y3}, . . . , {xv−1, yv−1}, {yv−1, xv}, {xv, z}.  d  Starting with the case v = 1 and applying the operations v → 2v − 2, v → 2v + 1 yields all nonnegative numbers not of the form 3k + 2, because the cases 6k +  0, 1, 3, 4  come respectively from the smaller cases 3k +  1, 0, 1, 3 .  Incidentally, “Steiner triple systems” should not have been named after Steiner, although that name has become deeply entrenched in the literature. Steiner’s publica- tion [Crelle 45  1853 , 181–182] came several years after Kirkman’s, and Felix Klein has noted [Vorlesungen über die Entwicklung der Math. im 19. Jahrhundert 1  Springer, 1926 , 128] that Steiner quoted English authors without giving them credit, during the later years of his life. Moreover, the concept had appeared already in two well-known books of J. Plücker [System der analytischen Geometrie  1835 , 283–284; Theorie der algebraischen Curven  1839 , 245–247]. Kirkman wrote his paper in response to a substantially more general problem posed by W. S. B. Woolhouse, namely to find the maximum number of t-element subsets of {1, . . . , n} in which no q-element subset appears more than once; that problem remains unsolved. [See Lady’s and Gentleman’s Diary  1844 , 84;  1845 , 63–64;  1846 , 76, 78;  1847 , 62–67.] 11. Take a Steiner triple system on 2v + 1 objects.

In post-office trees, deletion is almost hopeless. 16. Let each triple correspond to a codeword, where each codeword has exactly three 1-bits, identifying the elements of the corresponding triple. If u, v, w are distinct codewords, u has at most two 1 bits in common with the superposition of v and w, since it had at most one in common with v or w alone.

Then we can split each row into two rows, with the circled element replaced by 0 and 1. To show that such encirclement is possible, note that the asterisks of each column can be arbitrarily divided into 32 groups of 7 each; then the 512 rows each contain asterisks of 7 different groups, and the 32 × 16 = 512 groups each appear in 7 different rows. Theorem 7.5.1E  the “marriage theorem”  now guarantees the existence of a perfect matching with exactly one circled element in each row and each group.  References: R. L.

One of my mathematician friends told me he would be willing to recognize computer science as a worthwhile ﬁeld of study as soon as it contains 1,000 deep theorems. This criterion should obviously be changed to include algorithms as well as theorems — say 500 deep theorems and 500 deep algorithms. But even so, it is clear that computer science today doesn’t measure up to such a test, if “deep” means that a brilliant person would need many months to discover the theorem or the algorithm. . . . The potential for “1,000 deep results” is there, but only perhaps 50 have been discovered so far. — DONALD E.

This book forms a natural sequel to the material on information structures in Chapter 2 of Volume 1, because it adds the concept of linearly ordered data to the other basic structural ideas. The title “Sorting and Searching” may sound as if this book is only for those systems programmers who are concerned with the preparation of general-purpose sorting routines or applications to information retrieval.
