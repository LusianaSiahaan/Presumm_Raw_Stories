Preface   ix  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Flash Catalyst 5.5  Adobe Flash is one of the most powerful products in the Adobe Creative Suite family. With their frequent enhancements and developments, Adobe Flash has become a ver- satile multitasking application that allows you to create websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, cartoon animations, and more. The secret behind Flash is that it has been developed side by side with the newest trends in web technology, such as the Rich Internet Applications. Another secret is the diverse capabilities within ActionScript, which have helped Flash extend its implementations into various projects, especially ActionScript 3 and other Object-Oriented Program- ming concepts. Flash presents an innovative tool for both designers and developers in creating websites and developing interactive designs. Along with the expansion of Flash, Adobe also released a developer version called Flex, and later renamed it Flash Builder. This tool is directed toward code lovers who would like to build intensive code applications in both Flash and Flash Builder. At the same time, Adobe also released Flash Catalyst for designers like me, who do not like to write a single line of code. Flash Catalyst is a platform for designers for creating interactive wireframes, websites, and user interfaces based on previous designs that they can import from other Adobe design tools like Photoshop and Illustrator. In Flash Catalyst, the design elements can also be converted into interactive compo- nents, which will be explored in this book. However, Flash Catalyst is not a substitute for Flash Builder, as it does not take care of the whole coding process, but only creates the basic interactions that can be used in creating wireframes for projects and basic application interactions. In this book we are going to discuss the different components of this software, and then briefly look at how Flash Catalyst can help us add interactivity to static designs. After going through the workflow, we will learn how to export projects to either SWF for web use, or AIR-installable applications for desktops.  1  www.it-ebooks.info   Let’s start with a quick overview of the Flash Catalyst interface and the structure of its panels.  Figure 1-1. Flash Catalyst CS 5.5  Flash Catalyst is very simple in its design and looks similar to other Adobe tools. Its workspace includes the following panels and features:    The Pages States panel lets you add pages to your projects, components to pages,  and states to the buttons.    The Breadcrumbs bar shows where you are in the artwork. For example, when you enter a component you want to edit, it will appear as a path at the top right of the workspace. The Breadcrumbs bar enables you to easily move around the project or the stage area by simply clicking on the path.    The Tools panel includes the basic shapes and tools you can create directly in Flash  Catalyst.    The Layers panel displays the layers of the imported files inside Flash Catalyst. You can also use it to create new layers when you want to create elements directly inside Catalyst.    The Library panel includes the elements and components that you have created or  imported into Flash Catalyst.    The Align panel allows you to align objects with each other on the stage area.   The Interaction panel helps you set the interaction properties for the components,  such as the buttons.  2  Chapter 1: Introduction to Flash Catalyst 5.5  www.it-ebooks.info     The Properties panel displays the properties of each object or component on the  stage.    The Appearance panel contains the blending modes and object properties.   The Filter panel lets you add filters to the images and objects onto the stage.   The Timeline panel is where you can add transitions between objects and pages.   The Common Library contains a collection of wireframes and placeholders that can be used inside Flash Catalyst. These wireframes are either Flash Catalyst or Flex components, or just placeholders.    The Component HUD is not a panel, but it becomes visible when you select a text or a component. You can use it to convert graphic elements into components, or to edit an existing component on the stage.  Figure 1-2. The new Common Library panel in Flash CS5.5  The above panels are parts of the Flash Catalyst Design workspace. If you would like to preview the code behind the project design, you can switch to the Code Workspace from the Window menu.  Figure 1-3. The Code Workspace in Flash Catalyst CS 5.5  Introduction to Flash Catalyst 5.5  3  www.it-ebooks.info   The Code Workspace includes the code of the project in MXML. The Side Navigation panel allows you to navigate between project files, while the Problems panel at the bottom allows you to check the code errors.  4  Chapter 1: Introduction to Flash Catalyst 5.5  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 2 Flash Catalyst Components  As we mentioned before, Flash Catalyst uses components to build user interfaces and wireframes. In the new Flash Catalyst CS5.5, these components are found in the Com- mon Library. In this chapter we will go through the components to understand their different types, and in the following chapters we will learn how to customize them. In the Common Library panel, the components are classified into three categories:    The Flash Catalyst components are editable components that can be customized  and are able to interact with other content inside Flash Catalyst.    Flex components are Flash Builder-based, therefore they are not functional in Flash Catalyst; you need to import your project into Flash Builder to be able to work with these components.    Placeholders are objects that will be replaced by the actual objects in Flash Builder. They are used for marking the places of common objects, such as charts, avatars, maps, etc.  Figure 2-1. The available components in Flash Catalyst  Now, let’s go through each component of Flash Catalyst and learn how to edit them.  5  www.it-ebooks.info   Button This component converts the artwork into an interactive button you can use to execute specific actions from the Interaction panel. To add a button to the stage, just drag the Button component from the Common Li- brary at the bottom of the workspace. You can edit a button by double-clicking it to give it a customized name, or you can click on any of the button states in the HUD. When you activate the button-editing mode, you will notice that in addition to the scale handles, the component also contains the constrain handles dots. When you click on these constrains, a guide appears between the component edges and document edges to show the distance between the edges of the project and the component.  Figure 2-2. The Button component’s different states  The Button component includes the following four options for button states:    Up is the normal state of the button when no interaction is made.   The Over state is when the user hovers over the button with the mouse.   The Down state is when the user clicks on the button.   The Disabled state shows when the button is inactive.  You can either use default shapes for the button states, or customize them with your own design.  6  Chapter 2: Flash Catalyst Components  www.it-ebooks.info   Checkbox and Radio Button These are components for forms. They are default shapes. They consist of two parts, the checkbox and the label, which is the one that includes the text. The Checkbox includes the eight states listed below:    Up   Over   Down   Disabled   Selected, Up   Selected, Over   Selected, Down   Selected, Disabled  Figure 2-3. The Checkbox and Radio Button components  These states are similar to button states; the difference is that they only show the states in two cases: the selected and unselected.  Checkbox and Radio Button  7  www.it-ebooks.info   Horizontal and Vertical Scrollbars These two components are similar in structure and are used for creating scrolling con- tent. When you drag any of them onto the stage and double-click to edit them, you will notice that they have three states: Active, Inactive and Disabled.  Figure 2-4. The Horizontal and Vertical Scrollbars  The artwork of the scrollbar consists of the following:    The Up and Down buttons allow the user to scroll up and down. In the Horizontal  scrollbars, the buttons represent the left and right buttons.    The Thumb part is the scrolling part that the user can click and drag.   The Track part is the background of the moving thumb that indicates the active  area in which the thumb will move.  While you customize your own artwork and convert it into a scrollbar, some parts are essential for creating the components; these are the Thumb and the Track. If you had not defined the Up and Down buttons previously, you will get a scrollbar without up and down buttons.  8  Chapter 2: Flash Catalyst Components  www.it-ebooks.info   Horizontal and Vertical Sliders Unlike scrollbars, the Slider component does not include up and down buttons, but you can scroll the content by dragging the Track part.  Figure 2-5. The Horizontal and Vertical Sliders  The  Horizontal  and  Vertical  Sliders  consist  of  two  main  parts,  the  Thumb  and  the Track. The states for this component are either Normal or Disabled.  Text Input Component This component is used for creating a text field where the user can enter specific in- formation. When you enter the component-editing mode of the Text Input component, you will notice that it contains the input text field, which you can find in the HUD named as Editable Text.  Text Input Component   9  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-6. The input text component  You can edit the style and format of the text field through the Appearance panel. This component includes four states: Normal, Disabled, Prompt Normal, and Prompt Disabled.  Toggle Button The Toggle button component allows you to toggle between two modes for buttons, both of which have eight states, as listed below:    Up   Over   Down   Disabled   Selected, Up   Selected, Over   Selected, Down   Selected, Disabled  10  Chapter 2: Flash Catalyst Components  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-7. The Toggle button cases  These buttons consist of a required text label and an optional background image.  Data List Component This component allows you to add multiple list items and scroll through them hori- zontally, or pan them vertically using horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  Figure 2-8. The Data List component  Data List Component   11  www.it-ebooks.info   When you click to edit the component, you will notice that it contains the list content and both the vertical and horizontal scrollbars. These items are required for the com- ponent to work. The repeated data list is a text area where you can add or edit list items through the Design Time Data panel at the bottom of the workspace. When you open this panel, you will notice that there are items listed in it. You can delete a value through the Delete icon at the bottom of the panel, or add new items with the Add Row button.  12  Chapter 2: Flash Catalyst Components  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 3 Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  There are two methods by which you can start working with Flash Catalyst: you can either import artwork as Photoshop PSD, Illustrator AI, or FXG for Adobe Fireworks, or create the artwork in Flash Catalyst. Flash Catalyst’s default components are only useful as wireframe tools, as they do not provide creative artwork, so if you are using Flash Catalyst to add interactivity to your creative design, it is preferable to create the artwork in Photoshop or Illustrator.  Figure 3-1. The New document dialog box  When you want to create a Flash Catalyst file from scratch, a dialog box appears for setting the file’s dimensions and background color. But before you can create a Flash Catalyst file based on the imported Photoshop artwork, a dialog box appears where you can set the following:    The Artboard size and color lets you set the file size and background color.   The Fidelity section lets you choose from the following:  — Keep the image layers editable or flatten its effects.  13  www.it-ebooks.info   — Crop or flatten the shape layers. — The text layer import options, such as editable text, vector outlines or flatten  text layers.    You can also choose whether you want to import the non-visible layers.  Figure 3-2. The Import PSD dialog box  You can also click the Advanced button to access the advanced dialog box where you can preview the layers of the artwork and each of their import options individually. When you import an Illustrator artwork into Flash Catalyst, the import dialog box will look a little different, as Illustrator’s import feature includes some extra options for converting or flattening blends and gradients. It also has an option for importing unused symbols.  Figure 3-3. The Import AI dialog box  14  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   In addition to importing PSD, AI, and FXG files, Flash Catalyst also allows you to import various types of other resources while you’re working on the project, such as SWF, images, videos, and sound files. Images can be imported in JPG, PNG, GIF, and JPEG formats, videos in FLV or F4V formats, and sound files in MP3 format. In the example below, we will start by importing an Adobe Illustrator web page design into Flash Catalyst and then learn how to modify it in the Catalyst workspace.  1. Open Flash Catalyst and notice the New from the Design File part. 2. Choose Create a New Project from Illustrator File and open webpage_ai.ai. 3. In the import dialog box, make sure to keep all the elements editable so that you  can modify them later.  Figure 3-4. Import Illustrator Artwork into Flash Catalyst project  This will import the web page design into the stage, and you will see that Page1 is created in the Page Status panel. The artwork layers and elements have also been im- ported into the Layers and Library panels.  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   15  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-5. The Flash Catalyst project with the imported content  To start adding interactivity, first we need to convert the webpage elements into inter- active components. Now, let us start converting the web design elements with the top menu and then continue by converting each link to a button component as follows:  4. Select the first link, Home, and from the HUD, choose to convert it to a button.  Figure 3-6. The Button component in the HUD  5. The text has been converted into a link, and the HUD now allows you to edit the  button. Click on any of the button statuses to enter the Button editing mode.  16  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-7. The Button component selected  6. Click the Up button in the HUD. You will find four statuses in the Page Status  panel. Keep the first status the same.  7. Select the Over status and draw a yellow rectangle under the text with the rectangle tool, as below. In the Properties panel, set the outline to none and the fill color to yellow.  Figure 3-8. The Over state of the button  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   17  www.it-ebooks.info   8. In Down status, draw the same rectangle and change the opacity of the text to 50%  in the Properties panel.  Figure 3-9. The Opacity value in the Properties panel  9. Repeat these steps with the rest of the menu links.  Now we will move on to the search white box to set the text input field as below:  10. Select the white area under the image. 11. From the HUD, select Text Input and click Edit.  18  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-10. The Text Input component in the HUD  12. Select the white box. Navigate to Filter in the Properties panel and choose Inner  Shadow.  13. In the Filter properties, set the distance to 0 and the blur to 10. 14. Deselect the white area and the text field above it. Now you can edit the input text  properties, such as the font, size, color, etc.  Figure 3-11. The search box background effect  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   19  www.it-ebooks.info   15. Click the white area again to display the text field. You can choose to edit the text properties from the Properties panel. In this example, I just moved the text area to be aligned with the center of the white area.  16. After converting the white area into a text input field, we will need to convert the  button next to it into clickable button, like we did with the menu above.  17. Select the button and from the HUD, choose the button component.  Figure 3-12. The search field button  Up state with no change.  Properties panel.  18.

You can also change its size in the Properties panel.  21. Now  exit  the  button-editing  mode  by  clicking  on  the  root  workspace  on  the  Breadcrumbs bar.  22. Now test what we have done so far by choosing File > Run Project, or click Cmd  +Enter  Ctrl+Enter in Windows .  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   21  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-14.

In the scrollbar area, select the gray scrolling background and the scrolling rectan-  gle to convert it into a scrolling bar.  24. From the components HUD, select the Vertical Scrollbar and then click Edit to  access the editing mode.  22  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-15.

Click Cmd+Enter  Ctrl+Enter in Windows  to test the scrolling functionality and  how the scrollbar scrolls to display the hidden text.  On the left side, the Read More link will point to an external URL. In the next steps, we will convert this text into a link to which we can add interaction later:  33. Select the Read More text and choose the Button component from the HUD. 34. Click the Up state in the HUD to enter the component-editing mode. 35. In the Over state, select the text and set its opacity to 75% in the Properties panel. 36. Using the Rectangle tool, draw a thin line under the text, which will appear when  the user hovers over it.  37. Repeat the same steps in the Down state and exit the component-editing mode.  By this point, we have prepared the first page and converted the required areas into components for interaction. Before moving on to the interaction part, we will need to import the rest of the website pages that will be linked together through the top navi- gation menu. In the second page, we will learn about adding videos to Flash Catalyst projects. Im- porting videos is as simple as importing other content like images, SWF, and sounds. You can create a new page by clicking the New Blank State icon in the Page State top panel and importing the new web design to it through the File→Import command, or you can click the Duplicate State icon to duplicate the current web design. In our ex- ample, we will duplicate the first page to get a similar page to the first one, and we will customize it as follows:  38. Click the Duplicate State icon in the Page State panel and rename the second page  Gallery.  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   25  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-18.

Test the current video properties by choosing Run Project in the File menu.  28  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   46. Since we will use our own Play and Stop custom buttons, we need to remove the current  controller.  In  the  video  Properties  panel,  choose  None  from  the  Video Controls option.  Figure 3-22. Choose None from the controller drop-down list  47. Make the video buttons layer visible in the Layers panel in order for the video Play  and Stop buttons to be displayed on the stage.  48. Place the buttons under the video. 49. Click the player button and form the HUD, choose the Button component, then  click the Up state to enter the editing mode for this component.

Now select the Over state and set the opacity  of the button to 100%.  51. Repeat the above steps with the pause button.  As we mentioned above, in the current stage, we are setting up the artwork for inter- action. In the next chapter we will learn how to add interaction to the components we have created, including the video controllers. After completing the settings for the second page, we will add a new page to create the contact page as follows:  52. Click Duplicate State in the Page State panel and take the video and the controllers’ content off the design stage and hide them through the Layers panel. Rename the duplicated page Contact us.  30  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-24. Duplicate the video page to create the contact page  53. Make the contact layer visible in the Layers panel to reveal the contact form fields. 54. Place the contact form fields in the content area.  Figure 3-25. Importing the contact page artwork  55. Select the first white area and then go to the HUD to convert the selected area into  a Text Input component.  56. Repeat this with the other form fields as well.  Starting a Flash Catalyst Project   31  www.it-ebooks.info   57. Select the form button and convert it into a button component.  By this stage, we have finished converting the web design artwork into an interactive component in Flash Catalyst. We will use these elements in the next chapter to interact with each other and link the pages together. For further interactivity and more complex Flash projects, you can export your project to Flash Builder and add more components and functions to it.  32  Chapter 3: Starting a Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 4 Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  The purpose of converting the artwork into components was to prepare them for exe- cuting specific actions and transitions between pages, as we will discuss in this chapter. I chose to cover both interactions and transitions in the same chapter because they are linked together, as transitions in Flash Catalyst are done through either opening a spe- cific page or clicking a specific button. In this chapter we will start by looking at adding interaction to specific buttons, and after that we will move on to the interaction part. Interaction in Flash Catalyst is done through the Interaction panel, which allows you to add actions either to the components similar to buttons, or the application itself. You can also add an action that is applied once the page is loaded, such as a special animation or a transition. When you select a component or the applications stage by clicking on the stage area, the Add Interaction function will be activated. The first drop-down list shows how the action will respond to the mouse action. For example, the On Click action indicates that the action will be executed when the user clicks on the component. The component interaction includes the following events that will trigger the action:    On Click   On Double Click   On Mouse Up   On Mouse Down   On Roll Out   On Roll Over  33  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-1. The components interaction event triggered  When you add an action to the application itself without any of the components se- lected, you will notice that the On Application Start is the only available option. The Actions drop-down list includes the following actions:    Play Transition to State is used for linking pages to each other by animated transi-  tions between them, if applied.    Play Action Sequence lets you play a specific set of actions in the timeline.   The Go to URL opens a URL when the user clicks on it. You can also set how you  want the new URL to be opened  for example, in a new page .    Play Video   Pause Video   Stop Video  34  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-2. The Action drop-down list  Each of the actions has its own options, as we will see in the steps below. In the previous steps, we saw that the project consists of three pages that are linked together by the top menu navigation. Here we will continue adding interaction to this menu so that we can navigate between pages. We will also add interaction to other parts of the design as follows:  1. If you did not rename the pages already, double-click the first page and name it Home. Repeat this with the second and third pages and name them Gallery and Contact us.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   35  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-3. Renaming the Pages in the Page State panel  2. Make sure you are on the first page. Select the first Home button. 3. Open  the  Interaction  panel  and  click  Add  Interaction.  From  the  action  trigger,  choose On Click.  Figure 4-4.

Repeat the above steps with the second and third button and link them to the  Gallery and Contact us pages.  7. Move the Read more link under the text, then choose the Go to URL from the  Actions drop-down list in the Interaction panel.  8. In the URL section, type the web address you would like to access, for example, www.oreilly.com. You do not need to add HTTP:  , because Flash Catalyst adds it by default.  Figure 4-6. Add Go to URL action to the button  9. From the next drop-list, choose Open in New Window to open the web page in a  new browser window or tab.  10. Now let’s move on to the second page. On this page, the Gallery button will not be active, and the first button—Home—will interact with the user to return to the first page. Select the Home button and from the Interaction panel, choose Play Transition to State, then select Home from the Choose State drop-down list.  11. In the Properties panel, choose the Hand cursor to display the hand. 12. Repeat this action with the Contactus button. 13. Repeat the same actions in the third page, Contact us. 14. Choose the play button of the video, and from the Interaction panel, choose Play  video and then choose the video name from the drop-down list.  15. Select the video stop button and choose Stop video in the Interaction panel.  38  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-7. The play and stop video buttons  16. Test the project by pressing Cmd+Enter  Ctrl+Enter in Windows  to check the pages’  navigation between each other.  These steps show an example of the interaction we can create in Flash Catalyst. Both the interactions and the transitions work closely together, since adding transitions and animations between pages and over buttons also improves the interactivity of the de- sign, as we will see in the next part. Before we discover how animations and transitions work in Flash Catalyst, let’s discuss the Timeline panel. It is quite different from the timelines we have in Flash or After Effects, which depend on keyframes and in between frames.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   39  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-8. The timeline in Flash and After Effects  Unlike in those applications, transitions in the Flash Catalyst timeline are controlled by start points and end points. For example, if you want to create a fade in transition between two pages, you have to determine the first page where the animation starts from and the end page where the animation will end. The animation displays as a block in the timeline, as we can see in the figure about the anatomy of the timeline below.  Figure 4-9. The timeline in Flash Catalyst    The State Transitions section includes all possible transition combinations between  states and pages. Also, it contains the action sequences.  40  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info     The second section is the start page or state, which defines the start point of the animation. Below it you will find all the elements of the page in layers; each layer should display the animation associated with each element.    The animation part shows the transition in a green block with a handle on its right, which controls the duration of the transition. By increasing the green area, you can make the animation slower, whereas if you decrease it, the animation will get faster. If more than one transition effect is associated with an object, you will find them under each other, linked to their layers. When you choose one of the transitions, you will notice that its properties appear in the properties panel where you can set its options, such as duration and easing.    The end state is on the right side of the timeline and shows the end point of the  animation, which can either be a page or a component state.    The bottom section lets you create smooth transitions between the states and set their smoothness. You can add other types of transitions such as Move, Resize, Rotate, and 3D Rotate. The Zoom slider lets you zoom in and out of the timeline blocks so that you can see more of the areas in the timeline. Also, you can delete any of the animations by selecting them and clicking the delete icon.  Figure 4-10. The Add Action list in the Timeline panel  Now we will learn how to add transition effects to our project by animating each ele- ment through the timeline. First, we will need to play a transition when the page loads. Based on the idea we discussed before, the animation should have start and end points. We will need to create a new duplicated page from the first Home page, which we can add to the beginning of the page sequence. In this page we will position the elements to the start point of the animation. We will also need to tell Flash Catalyst that this newly created page is the default start page, as every project must have a default start page. You can easily find this default page through the dot in the page or state in the Page State panel. Let’s see how to apply this concept to our example as below:  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   41  www.it-ebooks.info   17. Select the Home page in the Page State panel and click Duplicate State to create a  duplicated version of the home page.  18. Double-click on the duplicated version and name it Start. 19. Right-click the Start page and select Set as Default. This way, the animation will  start with the Start page.  20. Click on the Start page stage without selecting any element. From the Interaction  panel, choose Play Transition to State and choose target the Home page.  Figure 4-11. Set the Start page as the Default page  In the Start page, we are going to set the elements to the first position of the animation as follows: 21. In the Timeline panel, make sure you are selecting the Start→Home on the right  side of the panel.  22. Drag the webpage logo to the top of the screen. You will notice that a green block appears on the timeline next to the logo layer to show that there has been a change in the logo position between the Start page and the Home page.  42  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-12. Animating the webpage logo  23. While the logo is still selected, click on the Smooth transition to create a smooth  change in the animation’s position.  Figure 4-13. The Smooth animation in the timeline  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   43  www.it-ebooks.info   24. Select each of the top menu buttons and set their opacity value to 0% in the Prop-  erties panel.  Figure 4-14. The top menu animation  25. Select the image and shrink it into thin line in the banner area, using the resize handlers  in  the  transform  rectangle.  Then  click  Smooth  Transition  to  create  a smooth animation.  44  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-15. The banner image animation  26. Now select the Home page title, the line under it, the paragraph text, and the Read more button. Move all of them to the left of the screen stage and set their transition to smooth.  27. Select the search text area and the button next to it and set their opacity to 0%. 28. Drag the scrolling text content and background to the right side of the screen off  the stage.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   45  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-16. The scrolling content animation setup  29. If you want to preview the animation, click the Play button on the top right of the  Timeline panel to preview the animation without having to run the project.  By this stage, we have created a transition that will appear when the user loads the project. However, the transition may not look the way you want it, as all the content is animated with the same timing and animation speed. It is a good idea to create some variations in the timing of each animation to make the transitions more interesting, as we will see in the following steps and the figure below:  30. Keep the transitions of the logo and the Home button the same. 31. Select the Gallery button and move it a little so that it will appear after the Home  button animation.  starts.  32. Select and drag the Contact us button to start after the Gallery button transition  33. Drag the image banner animation’s handler to start where the timeline does and  end by the Contact us button’s transition.  34. Change the transition time of the Home title, the line under it, the text, and the Read more button so that they appear one by one with intersected animations between them.  35. Drag the animation of the search text area, its button, and the scrollbar to appear  after the Read more button.  46  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-17. The timeline animation block after modifications  In addition to these, you can also improve the transitions by adding easing to the ani- mations to give them a more realistic effect. The easing options are located in the Prop- erties panel. But before we look at how to add the easing to the transitions, let’s see the different easing types we can choose from:    Default is when the animation moves at a constant rate from the beginning to the  end of the transition.  then slows down again.  down toward the end.    Linear easing starts slowly and keeps on its speed until the middle of the animation,    Sine is a transition that moves fast until the middle of the animation and slows    Power is similar to Sine, the only difference being that it includes an Exponent value  that allows you to control the acceleration and deceleration of the transition.    Elastic makes the transition swing before it reaches its end point.   Bounce lets the transition move after the end point value and then return to the  end point again.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   47  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-18. The different easing options in the Properties panel  You can easily understand the difference between each easing if you look at how the curves appear under them to demonstrate how the transition will move. You can also edit the easing values through the properties related to each type. Now, let’s see how to apply easing methods to the transitions we have created previ- ously.  36. Select the logo animation block. In the Properties panel, go to the Easing part and  set the easing to Bounce.  37. Click the Play button to see how the easing will affect the animation’s transition. 38. Select the Home title, the line under it, the paragraph, and the Read more part and  set the easing to Elastic. Click the Play button to test the animation.  By this point, we have learned how to apply transition animations to the pages. In addition  to  the  default  transition  properties,  you  can  also  add  extra  transitions  by clicking the Add Action button next to the Smooth Transition button in the Timeline. The Add Action button allows you to add the following actions:    Video Controls, such as Play, Pause, and Stop.   SWF controls that include Play SWF, Stop SWF, Go to Frame and Play, and Go to  Frame and Stop.    Set Component State   Set Property, which lets you set a specific property for the component.  48  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info     Fade, which gives you the option to create a fade for the object from one state to  another; you can set this in the Properties panel.    Sound Effects lets you add a sound effect to the stage transition or component  status, such as buttons.    Move   Resize   Rotate 3D lets you create 3D transitions in the 3D space, such as rotating the object  in the 3D axes values that are listed in the Properties panel.  Notice that the added transition properties are added as green animation blocks under the default one in the artwork layer in the timeline.  Figure 4-19. Adding extra animation properties in the timeline  These transition effects can be applied to the button statuses as well, so you can create animations that occur when the user hovers over a button, as we will see in the top menu button states. In these buttons, we need to apply transitions for the lines under the menu text to appear along with a sound effect when the user hovers over it, as follows:  39. Double-click the Home button in the top menu to access the button editing-mode. 40. Move the rectangle under the text to the Up state a little below the text, and set its  opacity to 0%.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   49  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-20. The rectangle in the Up state  41. In the Over state, move the rectangle just under the text and set its opacity to 100%.  Figure 4-21. The rectangle in the Over state  42. Repeat what you did in the Up state in the Down state.  50  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   43. In the Timeline panel, select the Up→Over from the side list to change the anima-  tion between those two cases.  44. Select the rectangle’s layer and choose Smooth Transition to create a smooth move  when the user hovers over the button.  Figure 4-22. The button timeline smooth transition  45. In the Up→Over state we need to add a sound effect that will be played when the user hovers over the button. While the rectangle layer is selected, click Add Ac- tion and choose Sound Effect from the list.  Figure 4-23. Add Sound Effect from the Add Action list  46. A dialog box appears to let you select the sound effect from the available assets.  Click the Import button to import sound effects.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   51  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-24. The Sound Effect dialog box  47. You can choose a sound effect from your own library or go to the Adobe Flash Catalyst  sound  effects  folder   Applications→Adobe  Flash  Catalyst  CS5.5→Sound Effects on a Mac, or Program files→Adobe→Adobe Flash Catalyst CS5.5→Sound Ef- fects in Windows .  48. Select a sound file, for example Electronic Slide.mp3, and click OK. 49. You will find the sound files listed under the Media section. Choose one and click  OK.  52  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-25. The selected sound listed in the Media section in the dialog box  50. Repeat the same rectangle animation actions with the Over→Down state to make  the rectangle fade when the user clicks the button.  51. Press the Play button to test the button animation sequence.  In the above steps, we learned to create transitions between two pages that have the same content. Now let’s see how to create transitions between two pages with different content. When making a transition between two pages with different content, the content of each page should be located in both pages. This way, you can control the fade in and fade out of the content during the transition, as we will see on the Home and Gallery pages below. 52. Select the Home→Gallery from the state transition side list in the Timeline. You will notice that the Gallery’s page content is put outside the screen in the Home page. On the other hand, the Home page’s content is still located in the Gallery page outside the workspace.  Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst   53  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-26. The Home→Gallery stage animation  53. Select all the elements in the Home page and click Smooth Transition to create an animated move off screen for the Home elements. Then move the animation to its position in the stage for the Gallery elements.  54. You can edit the transitions and apply easing options as we did in the previous  steps.  In this chapter, we have learned to add interactivity and animated transitions to our project. Now let’s see how to create user interfaces or web pages in Flash Catalyst based on imported artworks from Adobe Illustrator, and how to convert the artworks into func- tional components. After finishing the project or wireframe and testing it, the project can be published in either SWF or AIR formats, as we will see in the next chapter.  54  Chapter 4: Interactions and Transitions in Flash Catalyst  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 5 Publishing the Flash Catalyst Project  This is the final step in the design or wireframe project process, in which we are going to learn how to publish projects in SWF format to display them on the web, or in AIR format to create desktop-installable applications. As we saw in the previous example, we do not need to publish the project to see it while we are still working, but it is possible to preview it through File→Run Project, or by pressing Cmd+Enter  Ctrl+Enter in Windows  to run the project in the default browser. You can publish the project by choosing Publish SWF AIR from the File menu or using the shortcut Shift+Cmd+F12  Shift+Ctrl+F12 in Windows .  Figure 5-1. Publish SWF AIR from the File menu  55  www.it-ebooks.info   Since Flash Catalyst does not provide extensive functionality, many users export their Flash Catalyst projects to Flash Builder to complete them. However, it is preferable to do the publish step in Flash Builder rather than Catalyst. The Publish SWF AIR dialog box in Flash Catalyst includes the following options:    The Output directory is the location where the published project will be saved.   Build for Accessibility checkbox   Build version for uploading to web server checkbox   Build version to view offline checkbox   Build AIR application checkbox   Embed fonts  Figure 5-2. Publish SWF AIR dialog box  The Embed fonts option allows you to embed fonts in Flash Catalyst projects. If the project does not include any fonts to embed, this option will not be selectable. The advantage of embedding the font in the project is that you can make sure that the user will see the project as you designed it, even if they do not have the font installed on their computer. Make sure to only embed the fonts that will not be available on the user’s computer, otherwise this will affect the size and performance of your project. When you click publish, you will notice that Flash Catalyst saves three versions of the project to the specified location: a web version, a local version, and an AIR application version. The web version includes the SWF, the HTML container, the SWFObject.js,  56  Chapter 5: Publishing the Flash Catalyst Project  www.it-ebooks.info   and the files that will ensure that the application runs properly on your client’s com- puter.  Project Performance Running an optimized project can help the application load faster and prevents the computer from consuming a lot of the CPU resources. However, it is important to consider the following optimization tips to help you create fast-loading applications. Remove the unnecessary artwork or components from the project at each state. For example, if you have an element that is not used in the state and is not part of the state transition, you can delete this element by selecting it and clicking the Delete key. Note that the element may appear nonfunctional in a specific state but can still be part of the transition  animation.  If  you  remove  it  from  this  state,  the  transition  will  not  work properly. The second tip is optimizing the artwork through the Optimize Artwork drop-down menu from the HUD. In this menu, you have different optimization options, such as:  Optimize Vector Graphics  This option allows you to compress the vector elements in the design. If you choose it, you will notice that the HUD displays Optimized Graphics in the element title.  In some cases, the complex vector graphics can cause huge CPU consumption, which may result in slow performance, even if the size of the project is fine. In this case, converting the vector graphics into rasterized bitmaps will ensure that the project runs properly.  Rasterize  Compress  This option allows you to compress the image by a specified percentage. Please note that the higher the compression percentage, the lower quality you get.  Convert to Linked Image  This smart solution takes the image out of the project and loads it externally from the project folder. This option can decrease the project size and allows you easily edit images by replacing them in the external folder.  Project Performance  57  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-3. Optimize artwork options in the HUD  In this quick guide to Flash Catalyst CS5.5, we have learned how to import artwork, convert it into interactive components that can do specific actions, and how to apply animated transitions between project pages. Most of the other tasks in Flash Catalyst are based on these concepts and workflow, so you can start creating your own project and practice using the different options to create interactive UI or application wire- frames.
