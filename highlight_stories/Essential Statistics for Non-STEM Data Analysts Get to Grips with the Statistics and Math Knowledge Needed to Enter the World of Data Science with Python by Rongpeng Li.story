really  on the increase as companies, governments, and non-profit organizations have shifted  toward a data-driven approach.  Many new graduates, as well as people who have been working for years, are now trying  to add data science as a new skill to their resumes. One significant barrier for stepping  into the realm of data science is statistics, especially for people who do not have a science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics  STEM  background or left the classroom  years ago. This book is designed to fill the gap for those people. While writing this book,   I tried to explore the scattered concepts in a dot-connecting fashion such that readers   feel that new concepts and techniques are needed rather than simply being created from   thin air. By the end of this book, you will be able to comfortably deal with common statistical  concepts and computation in data science, from fundamental descriptive statistics and  inferential statistics to advanced topics, such as statistics using tree-based methods and  ensemble methods. This book is also particularly handy if you are preparing for a data  scientist or data analyst job interview. The nice interleaving of conceptual contents and  code examples will prepare you well.  Who this book is for This book is for people who are looking for materials to fill the gaps in their statistics  knowledge. It should also serve experienced data scientists as an enjoyable read. The book  assumes minimal mathematics knowledge and it may appear verbose, as it is designed so  that novices can use it as a self-contained book and follow the book chapter by chapter  smoothly to build a knowledge base on statistics from the ground up.   viii     Preface What this book covers Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing, introduces basic  concepts in data collection, cleaning, and simple preprocessing. Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, talks about descriptive statistics, which  are handy for the assessment of data quality and exploratory data analysis  EDA . Chapter 3, Visualization with Statistical Graphs, introduces common graphs that suit  different visualization scenarios. Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics, introduces the fundamental concepts and  methodologies in sampling and the inference techniques associated with it. Chapter 5, Common Probability Distributions, goes through the most common discrete  and continuous distributions, which are the building blocks for more sophisticated real- life empirical distributions. Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation, covers a classic and rich topic that solidifies your  knowledge of statistics and probability by having you estimate parameters from   accessible datasets. Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, looks at a must-have skill for any data scientist  or data analyst. We will cover the full life cycle of hypothesis testing, from assumptions to  interpretation. Chapter 8, Statistics for Regression, discusses statistics for regression problems, starting  with simple linear regression. Chapter 9, Statistics for Classification, explores statistics for classification problems,  starting with logistic regression. Chapter 10, Statistics for Tree-Based Methods, delves into statistics for tree-based methods,  with a detailed walk through of building a decision tree from first principles. Chapter 11, Statistics for Ensemble Methods, moves on to ensemble methods, which are  meta-algorithms built on top of basic machine learning or statistical algorithms. This  chapter is dedicated to methods such as bagging and boosting. Chapter 12, Best Practice Collection, introduces several important practice tips based on  the author's data science mentoring and practicing experience. Chapter 13, Exercises and Projects, includes exercises and project suggestions grouped   by chapter.    To get the most out of this book As Jupyter notebooks can run on Google Colab, a computer connected to the internet and  a Google account should be sufficient.

Section 1:   Getting Started   with Statistics for   Data Science  In this section, you will learn how to preprocess data and inspect distributions and  correlations from a statistical perspective. This section consists of the following chapters:     Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing    Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment    Chapter 3, Visualization with Statistical Graphs    1 Fundamentals of  Data Collection,  Cleaning, and  Preprocessing   Thank you for purchasing this book and welcome to a journal of exploration and  excitement! Whether you are already a data scientist, preparing for an interview, or  just starting learning, this book will serve you well as a companion. You may already  be familiar with common Python toolkits and have followed trending tutorials online.  However, there is a lack of a systematic approach to the statistical side of data science. This  book is designed and written to close this gap for you. As the first chapter in the book, we start with the very first step of a data science project:  collecting, cleaning data, and performing some initial preprocessing. It is like preparing  fish for cooking. You get the fish from the water or from the fish market, examine it, and  process it a little bit before bringing it to the chef.   4     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   You are going to learn five key topics in this chapter. They are correlated with other topics,  such as visualization and basic statistics concepts. For example, outlier removal will be  very hard to conduct without a scatter plot. Data standardization clearly requires an  understanding of statistics such as standard deviation. We prepared a GitHub repository  that contains ready-to-run codes from this chapter as well as the rest.  Here are the topics that will be covered in this chapter:     Collecting data from various data sources with a focus on data quality    Data imputation with an assessment of downstream task requirements    Outlier removal    Data standardization – when and how    Examples involving the scikit-learn preprocessing module  The role of this chapter is as a primer. It is not possible to cover the topics in an entirely  sequential fashion. For example, to remove outliers, necessary techniques such as  statistical plotting, specifically a box plot and scatter plot, will be used. We will come back  to those techniques in detail in future chapters of course, but you must bear with it now.  Sometimes, in order to learn new topics, bootstrapping may be one of a few ways to break  the shell. You will enjoy it because the more topics you learn along the way, the higher  your confidence will be.  Technical requirements The best environment for running the Python code in the book is on Google Colaboratory   https:  colab.research.google.com . Google Colaboratory is a product that  runs Jupyter Notebook in the cloud. It has common Python packages that are pre-installed  and runs in a browser. It can also communicate with a disk so that you can upload local  files to Google Drive. The recommended browsers are the latest versions of Chrome   and Firefox.  For more information about Colaboratory, check out their official notebooks: https:   colab.research.google.com . You can find the code for this chapter in the following GitHub repository: https:   github.com PacktPublishing Essential-Statistics-for-Non-STEM- Data-Analysts   Collecting data from various data sources     5  Collecting data from various data sources There are three major ways to collect and gather data. It is crucial to keep in mind that  data doesn't have to be well-formatted tables:     Obtaining structured tabulated data directly: For example, the Federal Reserve   https:  www.federalreserve.gov data.htm  releases well-structured  and well-documented data in various formats, including CSV, so that pandas can  read the file into a DataFrame format.      Requesting data from an API: For example, the Google Map API  https:   developers.google.com maps documentation  allows developers to  request data from the Google API at a capped rate depending on the pricing plan.  The returned format is usually JSON or XML.     Building a dataset from scratch: For example, social scientists often perform   surveys and collect participants' answers to build proprietary data.  Let's look at some examples involving these three approaches. You will use the UCI  machine learning repository, the Google Map API and USC President's Office websites as  data sources, respectively.  Reading data directly from files  Reading data from local files or remote files through a URL usually requires a good  source of publicly accessible data archives. For example, the University of California,  Irvine maintains a data repository for machine learning. We will be reading the air  quality dataset with pandas. The latest URL will be updated in the book's official GitHub  repository in case the following code fails. You may obtain the file from https:   archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning-databases heart- disease . From the datasets, we are using the processed.hungarian.data file.  You need to upload the file to the same folder where the notebook resides.   6     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   The following code snippet reads the data and displays the first several rows of   the datasets:  import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv "processed.hungarian.data",                  sep=",",                  names = ["age","sex","cp","trestbps",                           "chol","fbs","restecg","thalach",                           "exang","oldpeak","slope","ca",                           "thal","num"]  df.head    This produces the following output:  Figure 1.1 – Head of the Hungarian heart disease dataset  In the following section, you will learn how to obtain data from an API.  Obtaining data from an API In plain English, an Application Programming Interface  API  defines protocols,  agreements, or treaties between applications or parts of applications. You need to pass  requests to an API and obtain returned data in JSON or other formats specified in the   API documentation. Then you can extract the data you want.  Note  When working with an API, you need to follow the guidelines and restrictions  regarding API usage. Improper usage of an API will result in the suspension of  an account or even legal issues.    Collecting data from various data sources     7  Let's take the Google Map Place API as an example. The Place API  https:   developers.google.com places web-service intro  is one of many Google  Map APIs that Google offers. Developers can use HTTP requests to obtain information  about certain geographic locations, the opening hours of establishments, and the types of  establishment, such as schools, government offices, and police stations.  In terms of using external APIs Like many APIs, the Google Map Place API requires you to create an account  on its platform – the Google Cloud Platform. It is free, but still requires a credit  card account for some services it provides. Please pay attention so that you  won't be mistakenly charged.  After obtaining and activating the API credentials, the developer can build standard  HTTP requests to query the endpoints. For example, the textsearch endpoint is used  to query places based on text. Here, you will use the API to query information about  libraries in Culver City, Los Angeles:  1.  First, let's import the necessary libraries:  import requests import json  2.   Initialize the API key and endpoints. We need to replace API_KEY with a real API  key to make the code work:  API_KEY = Your API key goes here TEXT_SEARCH_URL = https:  maps.googleapis.com maps api  place textsearch json? query = "Culver City Library"  3.  Obtain the response returned and parse the returned data into JSON format. Let's   examine it:  response = requests.get TEXT_SEARCH_ URL+'query='+query+'&key='+API_KEY   json_object = response.json    print json_object    8     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   This is a one-result response. Otherwise, the results fields will have multiple entries.  You can index the multi-entry results fields as a normal Python list object:  {'html_attributions': [],  'results': [{'formatted_address': '4975 Overland Ave, Culver  City, CA 90230, United States',    'geometry': {'location': {'lat': 34.0075635, 'lng':  -118.3969651},     'viewport': {'northeast': {'lat': 34.00909257989272,       'lng': -118.3955611701073},      'southwest': {'lat': 34.00639292010727, 'lng':  -118.3982608298927}}},    'icon': 'https:  maps.gstatic.com mapfiles place_api  icons civic_building-71.png',    'id': 'ccdd10b4f04fb117909897264c78ace0fa45c771',    'name': 'Culver City Julian Dixon Library',    'opening_hours': {'open_now': True},    'photos': [{'height': 3024,      'html_attributions': ['<a href="https:  maps.google.com  maps contrib 102344423129359752463">Khaled Alabed '],      'photo_reference': 'CmRaAAAANT4Td01h1tkI7dTn35vAkZhx_- mg3PjgKvjHiyh80M5UlI3wVw1cer4vkOksYR68NM9aw33ZPYGQzzXTE 8bkOwQYuSChXAWlJUtz8atPhmRht4hP4dwFgqfbJULmG5f1EhAfWlF_ cpLz76sD_81fns1OGhT4KU-zWTbuNY54_4_XozE02pLNWw',      'width': 4032}],    'place_id': 'ChIJrUqREx-6woARFrQdyscOZ-8',    'plus_code': {'compound_code': '2J53+26 Culver City,  California',     'global_code': '85632J53+26'},    'rating': 4.2,    'reference': 'ChIJrUqREx-6woARFrQdyscOZ-8',    'types': ['library', 'point_of_interest', 'establishment'],    'user_ratings_total': 49}],  'status': 'OK'}  The address and name of the library can be obtained as follows:  print json_object["results"][0]["formatted_address"]  print json_object["results"][0]["name"]    Collecting data from various data sources     9  The result reads as follows:  4975 Overland Ave, Culver City, CA 90230, United States Culver City Julian Dixon Library  Information An API can be especially helpful for data augmentation. For example, if you  have a list of addresses that are corrupted or mislabeled, using the Google Map  API may help you correct wrong data.   Obtaining data from scratch There are instances where you would need to build your own dataset from scratch.  One way of building data is to crawl and parse the internet. On the internet, a lot of  public resources are open to the public and free to use. Google's spiders crawl the internet  relentlessly 24 7 to keep its search results up to date. You can write your own code to  gather information online instead of opening a web browser to do it manually. Doing a survey and obtaining feedback, whether explicitly or implicitly, is another way   to obtain private data. Companies such as Google and Amazon gather tons of data  from user profiling. Such data builds the core of their dominating power in ads and  e-commerce. We won't be covering this method, however.  Legal issue of crawling Notice that in some cases, web crawling is highly controversial. Before crawling  a website, do check their user agreement. Some websites explicitly forbid web  crawling. Even if a website is open to web crawling, intensive requests may  dramatically slow down the website, disabling its normal functionality to serve  other users. It is a courtesy not only to respect their policy, but also the law.   Here is a simple example that uses regular expression to obtain all the phone   numbers from the web page of the president's office, University of Southern   California: http:  departmentsdirectory.usc.edu pres_off.html:  1.  First, let's import the necessary libraries. re is the Python built-in regular   expression library. requests is an HTTP client that enables communication   with the internet through the http protocol:  import re import requests   10     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   2.   If you look at the web page, you will notice that there is a pattern within the phone  numbers. All the phone numbers start with three digits, followed by a hyphen and  then four digits. Our objective now is to compile such a pattern:  pattern = re.compile "\d{3}-\d{4}"   3.  The next step is to create an http client and obtain the response from the GET call:  response = requests.get "http:  departmentsdirectory.usc. edu pres_off.html"    4.  The data attribute of response can be converted into a long string and fed to the   findall method:  pattern.findall str response.data    The results contain all the phone numbers on the web page:   ['740-2111',  '821-1342',  '740-2111',  '740-2111',  '740-2111',  '740-2111',  '740-2111',  '740-2111',  '740-9749',  '740-2505',  '740-6942',  '821-1340',  '821-6292']  In this section, we introduced three different ways of collecting data: reading tabulated  data from data files provided by others, obtaining data from APIs, and building data from  scratch. In the rest of the book, we will focus on the first option and mainly use collected  data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In most cases, API data and scraped  data will be integrated into tabulated datasets for production usage.   Data imputation     11  Data imputation Missing data is ubiquitous and data imputation techniques will help us to alleviate   its influence. In this section, we are going to use the heart disease data to examine the pros and cons  of basic data imputation. I recommend you read the dataset description beforehand to  understand the meaning of each column.  Preparing the dataset for imputation The heart disease dataset is the same one we used earlier in the Collecting data from  various data sources section. It should give you a real red flag that you shouldn't take   data integrity for granted. The following screenshot shows missing data denoted by   question marks:  Figure 1.2 – The head of Hungarian heart disease data in VS Code  CSV rainbow extension enabled   First, let's do an info   call that lists column data type information:  df.info    Note df.info   is a very helpful function that provides you with pointers for  your next move. It should be the first function call when given an unknown  dataset.   12     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   The following screenshot shows the output obtained from the preceding function:  Figure 1.3 – Output of the info   function call  If pandas can't infer the data type of a column, it will interpret it as objects. For example,  the chol  cholesterol  column contains missing data. The missing data is a question mark  treated as a string, but the remainder of the data is of the float type. The records are  collectively called objects.  Python's type tolerance As Python is pretty error-tolerant, it is a good practice to introduce a necessary  type check. For example, if a column mixes the numerical values, instead of  using numerical values to check truth, explicitly check its type and write two  branches. Also, it is advised to avoid type conversion on columns with data  type objects. Remember to make your code completely deterministic and  future-proof.   Data imputation     13  Now, let's replace the question mark with the NaN values. The following code snippet  declares a function that can handle three different cases and treat them appropriately. The  three cases are listed here:     The record value is "?".    The record value is of the integer type. This is treated independently because  columns such as num should be binary. Floating numbers will lose the essence of  using 0-1 encoding.     The rest includes valid strings that can be converted to float numbers and original   float numbers.  The code snippet will be as follows:  import numpy as np def replace_question_mark val :     if val == "?":         return np.NaN     elif type val ==int:         return val     else:         return float val  df2 = df.copy   for  columnName, _  in df2.iteritems  :     df2[columnName] = df2[columnName].apply replace-question_ mark   Now we call the info   function and the head   function, as shown here:  df2.info     14     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   You should expect that all fields are now either floats or integers, as shown in the   following output:  Figure 1.4 – Output of info   after data type conversion  Now you can check the number of non-null entries for each column, and different  columns have different levels of completeness. age and sex don't contain missing values,  but ca contains almost no valid data. This should guide you on your choices of data  imputation. For example, strictly dropping all the missing values, which is also considered  a way of data imputation, will almost remove the complete dataset. Let's check the shape  of the DataFrame after the default missing value drops. You see that there is only one row  left. We don't want it:  df2.dropna  .shape  A screenshot of the output is as follows:  Figure 1.5 – Removing records containing NaN values leaves only one entry  Before moving on to other more mainstream imputation methods, we would love to  perform a quick review of our processed DataFrame.   Check the head of the new DataFrame. You should see that all question marks are  replaced by NaN values. NaN values are treated as legitimate numerical values, so native  NumPy functions can be used on them:  Data imputation     15  df2.head    The output should look as follows:  Figure 1.6 – The head of the updated DataFrame  Now, let's call the describe   function, which generates a table of statistics. It is a very  helpful and handy function for a quick peak at common statistics in our dataset:  df2.describe    Here is a screenshot of the output:  Figure 1.7 – Output from the describe   call  Understanding the describe   limitation Note that the describe   function only considers valid values. In this  sample, the average age value is more trustworthy than the average thal  value. Do also pay attention to the metadata. A numerical value doesn't  necessarily have a numerical meaning. For example, a thal value is encoded  to integers with given meanings.  Now, let's examine the two most common ways of imputation.   16     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing  Imputation with mean or median values Imputation with mean or median values only works on numerical datasets. Categorical  variables don't contain structures, such as one label being larger than another. Therefore,  the concepts of mean and median won't apply. There are several advantages associated with mean median imputation:     It is easy to implement.    Mean median imputation doesn't introduce extreme values.    It does not have any time limit.  However, there are some statistical consequences of mean median imputation. The  statistics of the dataset will change. For example, the histogram for cholesterol prior to  imputation is provided here:  Figure 1.8 – Cholesterol concentration distribution  The following code snippet does the imputation with the mean. Following imputation the  with mean, the histogram shifts to the right a little bit:   chol = df2["chol"] plt.hist chol.apply lambda x: np.mean chol  if np.isnan x  else  x , bins=range 0,630,30   plt.xlabel "cholesterol imputation"  plt.ylabel "count"    Data imputation     17  Figure 1.9 – Cholesterol concentration distribution with mean imputation  Imputation with the median will shift the peak to the left because the median is smaller  than the mean. However, it won't be obvious if you enlarge the bin size. Median and mean  values will likely fall into the same bin in this eventuality:  Figure 1.10 – Cholesterol imputation with median imputation  The good news is that the shape of the distribution looks rather similar. The bad news  is that we probably increased the level of concentration a little bit. We will cover such  statistics in Chapter 3, Visualization with Statistical Graphs.   18     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   Note In other cases where the distribution is not centered or contains a substantial  ratio of missing data, such imputation can be disastrous. For example, if the  waiting time in a restaurant follows an exponential distribution, imputation  with mean values will probably break the characteristics of the distribution.  Imputation with the mode most frequent value The advantage of using the most frequent value is that it works well with categorical  features and, without a doubt, it will introduce bias as well. The slope field is categorical in  nature, although it looks numerical. It represents three statuses of a slope value as positive,  flat, or negative.  The following code snippet will reveal our observation:  plt.hist df2["slope"],bins = 5  plt.xlabel "slope"  plt.ylabel "count" ;  Here is the output:  Figure 1.11 – Counting of the slope variable   Data imputation     19  Without a doubt, the mode is 2. Following imputation with the mode, we obtain the  following new distribution:   plt.hist df2["slope"].apply lambda x: 2 if np.isnan x  else  x ,bins=5  plt.xlabel "slope mode imputation"  plt.ylabel "count" ;  In the following graph, pay attention to the scale on y:  Figure 1.12 – Counting of the slope variable after mode imputation  Replacing missing values with the mode in this case is disastrous. If positive and  negative values of slope have medical consequences, performing prediction tasks on the  preprocessed dataset will depress their weights and significance.  Different imputation methods have their own pros and cons. The prerequisite is to fully  understand your business goals and downstream tasks. If key statistics are important, you  should try to avoid distorting them. Also, do remember that collecting more data is always  an option.   20     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing  Outlier removal Outliers can stem from two possibilities. They either come from mistakes or they have a  story behind them. In principle, outliers should be very rare, otherwise the experiment  survey for generating the dataset is intrinsically flawed. The definition of an outlier is tricky. Outliers can be legitimate because they fall into the  long tail end of the population. For example, a team working on financial crisis prediction  establishes that a financial crisis occurs in one out of 1,000 simulations. Of course, the  result is not an outlier that should be discarded. It is often good to keep original mysterious outliers from the raw data if possible. In other  words, the reason to remove outliers should only come from outside the dataset – only  when you already know the originals. For example, if the heart rate data is strangely  fast and you know there is something wrong with the medical equipment, then you can  remove the bad data. The fact that you know the sensor equipment is wrong can't be  deduced from the dataset itself. Perhaps the best example for including outliers in data is the discovery of Neptune.  In 1821, Alexis Bouvard discovered substantial deviations in Uranus' orbit based on  observations. This led him to hypothesize that another planet may be affecting Uranus'  orbit, which was found to be Neptune. Otherwise, discarding mysterious outliers is risky for downstream tasks. For example,  some regression tasks are sensitive to extreme values. It takes further experiments to  decide whether the outliers exist for a reason. In such cases, don't remove or correct  outliers in the data preprocessing steps. The following graph generates a scatter plot for the trestbps and chol fields. The  highlighted data points are possible outliers, but I probably will keep them for now:  Figure 1.13 – A scatter plot of two fields in heart disease dataset   Data standardization – when and how     21  Like missing data imputation, outlier removal is tricky and depends on the quality of data  and your understanding of the data. It is hard to discuss systemized outlier removal without talking about concepts such  as quartiles and box plots. In this section, we looked at the background information  pertaining to outlier removal. We will talk about the implementation based on statistical  criteria in the corresponding sections in Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment,  and Chapter 3, Visualization with Statistical Graphs.  Data standardization – when and how Data standardization is a common preprocessing step. I use the terms standardization  and normalization interchangeably. You may also encounter the concept of rescaling in  literature or blogs. Standardization often means shifting the data to be zero-centered with a standard  deviation of 1. The goal is to bring variables with different units ranges down to the same  range. Many machine learning tasks are sensitive to data magnitudes. Standardization is  supposed to remove such factors.  Rescaling doesn't necessarily bring the variables to a common range. This is done by  means of customized mapping, usually linear, to scale original data to a different range.  However, the common approach of min-max scaling does transform different variables  into a common range [0, 1]. People may argue about the difference between standardization and normalization. When  comparing their differences, normalization will refer to normalizing different variables  to the same range [0, 1], and min-max scaling is considered a normalization algorithm.  However, there are other normalization algorithms as well. Standardization cares more  about the mean and standard deviation. Standardization also transforms the original distribution closer to a Gaussian distribution.  In the event that the original distribution is indeed Gaussian, standardization outputs   a standard Gaussian distribution.  When to perform standardization Perform standardization when your downstream tasks require it. For example,  the k-nearest neighbors method is sensitive to variable magnitudes, so you  should standardize the data. On the other hand, tree-based methods are not  sensitive to different ranges of variables, so standardization is not required.    22     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   There are mature libraries to perform standardization. We first calculate the standard  deviation and mean of the data, subtract the mean from every entry, and then divide by  the standard deviation. Standard deviation describes the level of variety in data that will  be discussed more in Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment. Here is an example involving vanilla Python:   stdChol = np.std chol  meanChol = np.mean chol  chol2 = chol.apply lambda x:  x-meanChol  stdChol  plt.hist chol2,bins=range int min chol2  , int max chol2  +1,  1  ;  The output is as follows:     Figure 1.14 – Standardized cholesterol data  Note that the standardized distribution looks more like a Gaussian distribution now. Data standardization is irreversible. Information will be lost in standardization. It is only  recommended to do so when no original information, such as magnitudes or original  standard deviation, will be required later. In most cases, standardization is a safe choice  for most downstream data science tasks.  In the next section, we will use the scikit-learn preprocessing module to demonstrate tasks  involving standardization.   Examples involving the scikit-learn preprocessing module     23  Examples involving the scikit-learn  preprocessing module For both imputation and standardization, scikit-learn offers similar APIs:   1.  First, fit the data to learn the imputer or standardizer. 2.  Then, use the fitted object to transform new data.  In this section, I will demonstrate two examples, one for imputation and another   for standardization.  Note Scikit-learn uses the same syntax of fit and predict for predictive models. This  is a very good practice for keeping the interface consistent. We will cover the  machine learning methods in later chapters.  Imputation First, create an imputer from the SimpleImputer class. The initialization of the instance  allows you to choose missing value forms. It is handy as we can feed our original data into  it by treating the question mark as a missing value:  from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer imputer = SimpleImputer missing_values=np.nan, strategy="mean"   Note that fit and transform can accept the same input:  imputer.fit df2  df3 = pd.DataFrame imputer.transform df2    Now, check the number of missing values – the result should be 0:  np.sum np.sum np.isnan df3     Standardization Standardization can be implemented in a similar fashion:  from sklearn import preprocessing   24     Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing   The scale function provides the default zero-mean, one-standard   deviation transformation:  df4 = pd.DataFrame preprocessing.scale df2    Note In this example, categorical variables represented by integers are also zero- mean, which should be avoided in production.  Let's check the standard deviation and mean. The following line outputs   infinitesimal values:  df4.mean axis=0   The following line outputs values close to 1:  df4.std axis=0   Let's look at an example of MinMaxScaler, which transforms every variable into the  range [0, 1]. The following code fits and transforms the heart disease dataset in one step. It  is left to you to examine its validity:  minMaxScaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler   df5 = pd.DataFrame minMaxScaler.fit_transform df2    Let's now summarize what we have learned in this chapter.  Summary In this chapter, we covered several important topics that usually emerge at the earliest  stage of a data science project. We examined their applicable scenarios and conservatively  checked some consequences, either numerically or visually. Many arguments made here  will be more prominent when we cover other more sophisticated topics later. In the next chapter, we will review probabilities and statistical concepts, including the  mean, the median, quartiles, standard deviation, and skewness. I am sure you will then  have a deeper understanding of concepts such as outliers.   2  Essential Statistics  for Data Assessment  In Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing, we learned  about data collection, basic data imputation, outlier removal, and standardization. Hence,  this will provide you with a good foundation to understand this chapter. In this chapter, you are going to learn how to examine the essential statistics for  data assessment. Essential statistics are also often referred to as descriptive statistics.  Descriptive statistics provide simple, quantitative summaries of datasets, usually  combined with descriptive graphics. For example, descriptive statistics can demonstrate  the tendency of centralization or measures of the variability of features, and so on. Descriptive statistics are important. Correctly represented descriptive statistics give you   a precise summary of the datasets at your disposal. In this chapter, we will learn to   extract information and make quantitative judgements from descriptive statistics. Just   a heads-up at this point. Besides descriptive statistics, another kind of statistics is known  as inferential statistics, which tries to learn information from the distribution of the  population that the dataset was generated or sampled from. In this chapter, we assume the  data covers a whole population rather than a subset sampled from a distribution.   We will see the differences between the two statistics in later chapters as well. For now,  don't worry.   26     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:    Classifying numerical and categorical variables    Understanding mean, median, and mode    Learning about variance, standard deviation, percentiles, and skewness    Knowing how to handle categorical variables and mixed data types    Using bivariate and multivariate descriptive statistics  Classifying numerical and categorical  variables Descriptive statistics are all about variables. You must know what you are describing to  define corresponding descriptive statistics. A variable is also referred to as a feature or attribute in other literature. They all mean the  same thing: a single column in a tabulated dataset. In this section, you will examine the two most important variable types, numerical and  categorical, and learn to distinguish between them. Categorical variables are discrete and  usually represent a classification property of entry. Numerical variables are continuous and  descriptive quantitatively. Descriptive statistics that can be applied to one kind of variable  may not be applied to another one, hence distinguishing between them precedes analytics.  Distinguishing between numerical and categorical  variables In order to understand the differences between the two types of variables with the help  of an example, I will be using the population estimates dataset released by the United  States Department of Agriculture by way of a demonstration. It contains the estimated  population data at county level for the United States from 2010 to 2018. You can obtain  the data from the official website, https:  www.ers.usda.gov data-products  county-level-data-sets download-data , or the book's GitHub repository.  The following code snippet loads the data and examines the first several rows:  import pandas as pd df = pd.read_excel "PopulationEstimates.xls",skiprows=2  df.head 8    Classifying numerical and categorical variables     27  The output is a table with more than 140 columns. Here are two screenshots showing the  beginning and trailing columns:  Figure 2.1 – First 6 columns of the dfad   output  In the preceding dataset, there is a variable called Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013.  It takes the value of integers. This leads to pandas autointerpreting this variable; pandas  auto-interprets it as numerical. Instead, however, the variable is actually categorical.   Should you always trust libraries? Don't always trust what functions from Python libraries give you. They may be  wrong, and the developer, which is you, has to make the final decision.  After some research, we found the variable description on this page: https:   www.ers.usda.gov data-products rural-urban-continuum-codes .  According to the code standard published in 2013, the Rural-urban_Continuum  Code_2013 variable indicates how urbanized an area is.   28     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The meaning of Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013 is shown in Figure 2.2.  Figure 2.2 – Interpretation of Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013  Note Pandas makes intelligent auto-interpretations of variable types, but oftentimes  it is wrong. It is up to the data scientist to investigate the exact meaning of the  variable type and then change it.   Many datasets use integers to represent categorical variables. Treating them as numerical  values may result in serious consequences in terms of downstream tasks such as machine  learning, mainly because artificial distances between numerical values will be introduced. On the other hand, numerical variables often have a direct quantitative meaning. For  example, R_NET_MIG_2013 means the rate of net immigration in 2013 for a specific  area. A histogram plot of this numerical variable gives a more descriptive summary of  immigration trends in the States, but it makes little sense plotting the code beyond simple  counting.  Let's check the net immigration rate for the year 2013 with the following code snippet:  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.hist df["R_NET_MIG_2013"],bins=np.linspace np.nanmin df["R_ NET_MIG_2013"] ,np.nanmax df["R_NET_MIG_2013"] ,num=100   plt.title "Rate of Net Immigration Distribution for All  Records, 2013" ;   The result appears as follows.  Classifying numerical and categorical variables     29  Figure 2.3 – Distribution of the immigration rate for all records in datasets  Here are the observations drawn from Figure 2.3:      In either categorical or numerical variables, structures can be introduced to  construct special cases. A typical example is date or time. Depending on the  scenarios, date and time can be treated as categorical variables as well as numerical  variables with a semi-continuous structure.      It is common to convert numerical variables to categorical variables on the basis of  a number of rules. The rural-urban code is a typical example. Such a conversion is  easy for conveying a first impression.   30     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  Now that we have learned how to distinguish between numerical and categorical variables,  let's move on to understanding a few essential concepts of statistics, namely, mean,  median, and mode.  Understanding mean, median, and mode Mean, median, and mode describe the central tendency in some way. Mean and median  are only applicable to numerical variables whereas mode is applicable to both categorical  and numerical variables. In this section, we will be focusing on mean, median, and  mode for numerical variables as their numerical interactions usually convey interesting  observations.   Mean Mean, or arithmetical mean, measures the weighted center of a variable. Let's use n to  denote the total number of entries and    as the index. The mean   ̅  reads as follows:  Mean is influenced by the value of every entry in the population.  Let me give an example. In the following code, I will generate 1,000 random numbers  from 0 to 1 uniformly, plot them, and calculate their mean:  import random random.seed 2019  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   rvs = [random.random   for _ in range 1000 ] plt.hist rvs, bins=50  plt.title "Histogram of Uniformly Distributed RV" ;   = ∑xin   x̅   The resulting histogram plot appears as follows:  Understanding mean, median, and mode     31  Figure 2.4 – Histogram distribution of uniformly distributed variables between 0 and 1  The mean is around 0.505477, pretty close to what we surmised.  Median Median measures the unweighted center of a variable. If there is an odd number of entries,  the median takes the value of the central one. If there is an even number of entries,  the median takes the value of the mean of the central two entries. Median may not be  influenced by every entry's value. On account of this property, median is more robust or  representative than the mean value. I will use the same set of entries as in previous sections  as an example. The following code calculates the median:  np.median rvs    32     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The result is 0.5136755026003803. Now, I will be changing one entry to 1,000,  which is 1,000 times larger than the maximal possible value in the dataset and repeat the  calculation:  rvs[-1]=1000 print np.mean rvs   print np.median rvs    The results are 1.5054701085937803 and 0.5150437661964872. The mean  increased by roughly 1, but the median is robust.  The relationship between mean and median is usually interesting and worth investigating.  Usually, the combination of a larger median and smaller mean indicates that there are  more points on the bigger value side, but that an extremely small value also exists. The  reverse is true when the median is smaller than the mean. We will demonstrate this with  some examples later.  Mode The mode of a set of values is the most frequent element in a set. It is evident in a  histogram plot such that it represents the peak s . If the distribution has only one mode,  we call it unimodal. Distributions with two peaks that don't have to have equal heights are  referred to as bimodal.  Bimodals and bimodal distribution Sometimes, the definition of bimodal is corrupted. The property of being  bimodal usually refers to the property of having two modes, which, according  to the definition of mode, requires the same height of peaks. However, the term  bimodal distribution often refers to a distribution with two local maxima.  Double-check your distribution and state the modes clearly.  The following code snippet demonstrates two distributions with unimodal and bimodal  shapes, respectively:  r1 = [random.normalvariate 0.5,0.2  for _ in range 10000 ] r2 = [random.normalvariate 0.2,0.1  for _ in range 5000 ] r3 = [random.normalvariate 0.8,0.2  for _ in range 5000 ]  fig, axes = plt.subplots 1,2,figsize= 12,5   axes[0].hist r1,bins=100  axes[0].set_title "Unimodal"    Learning about variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, and skewness     33  axes[1].hist r2+r3,bins=100  axes[1].set_title "Bimodal" ;  The resulting two subplots appear as follows:  Figure 2.5 – Histogram of unimodal and bimodal datasets with one mode and two modes  So far, we have talked about mean, median and mode, mean, median and mode, which   are the first three statistics of a dataset. They are the start of almost all exploratory   data analysis.  Learning about variance, standard deviation,  quartiles, percentiles, and skewness In the previous section, we studied the mean, median, and mode. They all describe, to  a certain degree, the properties of the central part of the dataset. In this section, we will  learn how to describe the spreading behavior of data.  Variance With the same notation, variance for the population is defined as follows:  σ2 = ∑ xi−x̅ 2 n     Intuitively, the further away the elements are from the mean, the larger the variance.   Here, I plotted the histogram of two datasets with different variances. The one on the left  subplot has a variance of 0.09 and the one on the right subplot has a variance of 0.009, 10  times smaller.    34     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The following code snippet generates samples from the two distributions and plots them:  r1 = [random.normalvariate 0.5,0.3  for _ in range 10000 ] r2 = [random.normalvariate 0.5,0.1  for _ in range 10000 ]  fig, axes = plt.subplots 1,2,figsize= 12,5   axes[0].hist r1,bins=100  axes[0].set_xlim [-1,2]  axes[0].set_title "Big Variance"  axes[1].hist r2,bins=100  axes[1].set_title "Small Variance"  axes[1].set_xlim [-1,2] ;  The results appear as follows:  Figure 2.6 – Big and small variances with the same mean at 0.5  The following code snippet generates a scatter plot that will demonstrate the difference  more clearly. The variable on the x axis spreads more widely:  plt.figure figsize= 8,8   plt.scatter r1,r2,alpha=0.2  plt.xlim -1,2  plt.ylim -1,2  plt.xlabel "Big Variance Variable"    Learning about variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, and skewness     35  plt.ylabel "Small Variance Variable"  plt.title "Variables With Different Variances" ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 2.7 – Scatter plot of large-variance and small-variance variables  The spread in the x axis is significantly larger than the spread in the y axis, which indicates  the differences in variance magnitude. A common mistake is not getting the range correct.  Matplotlib will, by default, try to determine the ranges. You need to use   a code such as plt.xlim   to force it, otherwise the result is misleading.   36     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment Standard deviation Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is used more commonly to  measure the level of dispersion since it has the same unit as the original data. The formula  for the standard deviation of a population reads as follows:  σ =√∑ xi−x̅ 2 n     Standard deviation is extremely important in scientific graphing. A standard deviation is  often plotted together with the data and represents an estimate of variability.   For this chapter, I will be using the net immigration rate for Texas from 2011 to 2018  as an example. In the following code snippet, I will first extract the county-level data,  append the means and standard deviations to a list, and then plot them at the end. The  standard deviation is obtained using numpy.std   and the error bar is plotted using  matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar  :  dfTX = df[df["State"]=="TX"].tail -1   YEARS = [year for year in range 2011,2019 ] MEANS = [] STDS = [] for i in range 2011,2019 :     year = "R_NET_MIG_"+str i      MEANS.append np.mean dfTX[year]       STDS.append np.std dfTX[year]    plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.errorbar YEARS,MEANS,yerr=STDS  plt.xlabel "Year"  plt.ylabel "Net Immigration Rate" ;   Learning about variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, and skewness     37  The output appears as shown in the following figure:  Figure 2.8 – Net immigration rate across counties in Texas from 2011 to 2018  We can see in Figure 2.8 that although the net immigration in Texas is only slightly  positive, the standard deviation is huge. Some counties may have a big positive net rate,  while others may potentially suffer from the loss of human resources.  Quartiles Quartiles are a special kind of quantile that divide data into a number of equal portions.  For example, quartiles divide data into four equal parts with the ½ quartile as the median.  Deciles and percentiles divide data into 10 and 100 equal parts, respectively.   The first quartile, also known as the lower quartile  1  takes the value such that 25% of  all the data lies below it. The second quartile is the median. The third quartile,  3 , is also   known as the upper quartile and 25% of all values lie above it. Quartiles are probably the most commonly used quantiles because they are associated  with a statistical graph called a boxplot. Let's use the same set of Texas net immigration  data to study it.    38     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The function in NumPy is quantile   and we specify a list of quantiles as an argument  for the quantiles we want to calculate, as in the following single-line code snippet:  np.quantile dfTX["R_NET_MIG_2013"],[0.25,0.5,0.75]   The output reads as follows:  array [-7.83469971,  0.87919226,  8.84040759]   The following code snippet visualizes the quartiles:  plt.figure figsize= 12,5   plt.hist dfTX["R_NET_MIG_2013"],bins=50,alpha=0.6  for quartile in np.quantile dfTX["R_NET_ MIG_2013"],[0.25,0.5,0.75] : plt.axvline quartile,linestyle=':',linewidth=4   As you can see from the following output, the vertical dotted lines indicate the three  quartiles:  Figure 2.9 – Quartiles of the net immigration data in 2013  The lower and upper quartiles keep exactly 50% of the data values in between.  3− 1  is   referred to as the interquartile range called Interquartile Range  IQR  and it plays an  important role in outlier detection. We will see more about this soon.   Learning about variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, and skewness     39  Skewness Skewness differs from the three measures of variability we discussed in the previous  subsections. It measures the direction the data takes and the extent to which the data  distribution tilts. Skewness is given as shown in the following equation:  = ̅−σ     Various definitions of skewness The skewness we defined earlier is precisely referred to as Pearson's first  skewness coefficient. It is defined through the mode, but there are other  definitions of skewness. For example, skewness can be defined through the  median.  Skewness is unitless. If the mean is larger than the mode, skewness is positive, and we say  the data is skewed to the right. Otherwise, the data is skewed to the left.  Here is the code snippet that generates two sets of skewed data and plots them:  r1 = [random.normalvariate 0.5,0.4  for _ in range 10000 ] r2 = [random.normalvariate 0.1,0.2  for _ in range 10000 ] r3 = [random.normalvariate 1.1,0.2  for _ in range 10000 ]  fig, axes = plt.subplots 1,2,figsize= 12,5   axes[0].hist r1+r2,bins=100,alpha=0.5  axes[0].axvline np.mean r1+r2 , linestyle=':',linewidth=4  axes[0].set_title "Skewed To Right"  axes[1].hist r1+r3,bins=100,alpha=0.5  axes[1].axvline np.mean r1+r3 ,linestyle=':',linewidth=4  axes[1].set_title "Skewed to Left" ;   40     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The vertical dotted line indicates the position of the mean as follows:     Figure 2.10 – Skewness demonstration  Think about the problem of income inequality. Let's say you have a plot of the histogram  of the population with different amounts of wealth. A larger value just like where the x  axis value indicates the amount of wealth and the y axis value indicates the portion of the  population that falls into a certain wealth amount range. A larger x value means more  wealth. A larger y value means a greater percentage of the population falls into that range  of wealth possession. Positive skewness  the left subplot in Figure 2.10  means that even  though the average income looks good, this may be driven up by a very small number  of super rich individuals when the majority of people earn a relatively small income.  Negative skewness  the right subplot in Figure 2.10  indicates that the majority may have  an income above the mean value, so there might be some very poor people who may   need help. A revisit of outlier detection Now, let's use what we have learned to revisit the outlier detection problem.   The z-score, also known as the standard score, is a good criterion for detecting outliers. It  measures the distance between an entry and the population mean, taking the population  variance into consideration:  z= − ̅σ     Learning about variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, and skewness     41  If the underlying distribution is normal, a situation where a z-score is greater than 3 or  less than 0 only has a probability of roughly 0.27%. Even if the underlying distribution  is not normal, Chebyshev's theorem guarantees a strong claim such that at most 1\k^2,  where k is an integer, of the total population can fall outside k standard deviations. As an example, the following code snippet generates 10,000 data points that follow a  normal distribution:  random.seed 2020  x = [random.normalvariate 1, 0.5  for _ in range 10000 ] plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.hist x,bins=100,alpha=0.5 ; styles = [":","--","-."] for i in range 3 :     plt.axvline np.mean x  +  i+1 *np.std x ,                 linestyle=styles[i],                 linewidth=4      plt.axvline np.mean x  -  i+1 *np.std x ,                 linestyle=styles[i],                 linewidth=4  plt.title "Integer Z values for symmetric distributions" ;   In the generated histogram plot, the dotted line indicates the location where  dashed line indicates the location of  of    = ±1 . The   = ±2 . The dashed dotted line indicates the location    = ±3 :  Figure 2.11 – Integer z value boundaries for normally distributed symmetric data   42     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  If we change the data points, the distribution will change, but the z-score criteria will  remain valid. As you can see in the following code snippet, an asymmetric distribution   is generated rather than a normal distribution:  x = [random.normalvariate 1, 0.5  + random.expovariate 2  for _  in range 10000 ]  This produces the following output:      Figure 2.12 – Integer z value boundaries for asymmetric data  Note on the influence of extreme outliers A drawback of the z-score is that the mean itself is also influenced by extreme  outliers. The median can replace a mean to remove this effect. It is flexible to  set different criteria in different production cases.  We have covered several of the most important statistics to model variances in a dataset.  In the next section, let's work on the data types of features.   Knowing how to handle categorical variables and mixed data types     43  Knowing how to handle categorical variables  and mixed data types Categorical variables usually have simpler structures or descriptive statistics than  continuous variables. Here, we introduce the two main descriptive statistics and talk   about some interesting cases when converting continuous variables to categorical ones.  Frequencies and proportions When we discussed the mode for categorical variables, we introduced Counter, which  outputs a dictionary structure whose key-value pair is the element-counting pair. The  following is an example of a counter:  Counter {2.0: 394, 3.0: 369, 6.0: 597, 1.0: 472, 9.0: 425, 7.0:  434, 8.0: 220, 4.0: 217, 5.0: 92}   The following code snippet illustrates frequency as a bar plot where the absolute values of  counting become intuitive:  counter = Counter df["Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013"]. dropna    labels = [] x = [] for key, val in counter.items  :     labels.append str key       x.append val  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.bar labels,x  plt.title "Bar plot of frequency" ;   44     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  What you will get is the bar plot that follows:  Figure 2.13 – Bar plot of rural-urban continuum code  For proportionality, simply divide each count by the summation of counting, as shown in  the following code snippet:  x = np.array x  sum x   The shape of the bar plot remains the same, but the y axis ticks change. To better check   the relative size of components, I have plotted a pie plot with the help of the following   code snippet:  plt.figure figsize= 10,10   plt.pie x=x,labels=labels,  plt.title "Pie plot for rural-urban continuum code" ;   Knowing how to handle categorical variables and mixed data types     45  What you get is a nice pie chart as follows:  Figure 2.14 – Pie plot of rural-urban continuum code  It becomes evident that code 2.0 contains about twice as many samples as code   8.0 does.  Unlike the mean and median, categorical data does have a mode. We are going to reuse  the same data:  Counter df["Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013"].dropna     The output reads as follows:  Counter {2.0: 394, 3.0: 369, 6.0: 597, 1.0: 472, 9.0: 425, 7.0:  434, 8.0: 220, 4.0: 217, 5.0: 92}    46     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment  The mode is 6.0.   Note The mode means that the counties with urban populations of 2,500 to 19,999  adjacent to a metro area are most prevalent in the United States, and not the  number 6.0.  Transforming a continuous variable to a categorical  one Occasionally, we may need to convert a continuous variable to a categorical one. Let's take  lifespan as an example. The 80+ age group is supposed to be very small. Each of them will  represent a negligible data point in classification tasks. If they can be grouped together, the  noise introduced by the sparsity of this age group's individual points will be reduced. A common way to perform categorization is to use quantiles. For example, quartiles will  divide the datasets into four parts with an equal number of entries. This avoids issues such  as data imbalance. For example, the following code indicates the cut-offs for the categorization of the  continuous variable net immigration rate:   series = df["R_NET_MIG_2013"].dropna   quantiles = np.quantile series,[0.2*i for i in range 1,5 ]  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.hist series,bins=100,alpha=0.5  plt.xlim -50,50  for i in range len quantiles  :     plt.axvline quantiles[i],linestyle=":",                 linewidth=4  plt.title "Quantiles for net immigration data" ;   Using bivariate and multivariate descriptive statistics     47  As you can see in the following output, the dotted vertical lines split the data into 5 equal  sets, which are hard to spot with the naked eye. I truncated the x axis to select the part  between -50 and 50. The result looks as follows:  Figure 2.15 – Quantiles for the net immigration rate   Note on the loss of information Categorization destroys the rich structure in continuous variables. Only use it  when you absolutely need to.  Using bivariate and multivariate descriptive  statistics In this section, we briefly talk about bivariate descriptive statistics. Bivariate descriptive  statistics apply two variables rather than one. We are going to focus on correlation for  continuous variables and cross-tabulation for categorical variables.   48     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment Covariance The word covariance is often incorrectly used as correlation. However, there are a number  of fundamental differences. Covariance usually measures the joint variability of two  variables, while correlation focuses more on the strength of variability. Correlation  coefficients have several definitions in different use cases. The most common descriptive  statistic is the Pearson correlation coefficient. We will also be using it to describe the  covariance of two variables. The correlation coefficient for variables x and y from a  population is defined as follows:  ρ ,  =1∑   − ̅   − ̅   =1 σxσy     Let's first examine the expression's sign. The coefficient becomes positive when x is greater  than its mean and y is also greater than its own mean.  Another case is when x and y are both smaller than their means, respectively. The  products sum together and then get normalized by the standard deviation of each variable.  So, a positive coefficient indicates that x and y vary jointly in the same direction. You can  make a similar argument about negative coefficients. In the following code snippet, we select the net immigration rates for counties in Texas   as our datasets and use the corr   function to inspect the correlation coefficient   across years:   corrs = dfTX[['R_NET_MIG_2011','R_NET_MIG_2012', 'R_NET_ MIG_2013', 'R_NET_MIG_2014', 'R_NET_MIG_2015','R_NET_MIG_2016',  'R_NET_MIG_2017', 'R_NET_MIG_2018']].corr    The output is a so-called correlation matrix whose diagonal elements are the self- correlation coefficients, which are just 1:  Figure 2.16 – Correlation matrix for the net immigration rate   Using bivariate and multivariate descriptive statistics     49  A good way to visualize this matrix is to use the heatmap   function from the Seaborn  library. The following code snippet generates a nice heatmap:  import seaborn as sns plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 12}  sns.heatmap corrs,cmap="YlGnBu" ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 2.17 – Heatmap of a correlation matrix for net immigration rates in Texas  We do see an interesting pattern that odd years correlate with one another more strongly,  and even years correlate with each other more strongly, too. However, that is not the case  between even - and odd - numbered years. Perhaps there is a 2-year cyclic pattern and the  heatmap of the correlation matrix just helped us discover it.   50     Essential Statistics for Data Assessment Cross-tabulation Cross-tabulation can be treated as a discrete version of correlation detection for  categorical variables. It helps derive innumerable insights and sheds light on downstream  task designs. Here is an example. I am creating a list of weather information and another list of a  golfer's decisions on whether to go golfing. The crosstab   function generates the  following table:  weather = ["rainy","sunny","rainy","windy","windy",            "sunny","rainy","windy","sunny","rainy",            "sunny","windy","windy"] golfing = ["Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No",           "Yes","No","Yes","No","No"]  dfGolf = pd.DataFrame {"weather":weather,"golfing":golfing}  pd.crosstab dfGolf.weather, dfGolf.golfing, margins=True   Figure 2.18 – Cross-tabulation for golfing decisions  As you can see, the columns and rows give the exact counts, which are identified by the  column name and row name. For a dataset with a limited number of features, this is a  handy way to inspect imbalance or bias. We can tell that the golfer goes golfing if the weather is sunny, and that they seldom go  golfing on rainy or windy days. With that, we have come to the end of the chapter!   Summary     51  Summary Statistics or tools to assess datasets were introduced and demonstrated in this chapter. You  should be able to identify different kinds of variables, compute corresponding statistics,  and detect outliers. We do see graphing as an essential part of descriptive statistics.  In the next chapter, we will cover the basics of Python plotting, the advanced  customization of aesthetics, and professional plotting techniques.     3 Visualization with  Statistical Graphs  A picture is worth a thousand words. Humans rely on visual input for more than 90% of  all information obtained. A statistical graph can demonstrate trends, explain reasons,   or predict futures much better than words if done right.  Python data ecosystems come with a lot of great tools for visualization. The three most  important ones are Matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The first two are mainly for   static plotting, while plotly is capable of interactive plotting and is gaining in   popularity gradually. In this chapter, you will focus on static plotting, which is the backbone of data  visualization. We have already extensively used some plots in previous chapters to  illustrate concepts.  In this chapter, we will approach them in a systematic way. The topics that will be covered  in this chapter are as follows:     Picking the right plotting types for different tasks    Improving and customizing visualization with advanced aesthetic customization    Performing statistical plotting tailored for business queries    Building stylish and professional plots for presentations or reports   54     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Let's start with the basic Matplotlib library.  Basic examples with the Python   Matplotlib package In this chapter, we will start with the most basic functionalities of the Matplotlib package.  Let's first understand the elements to make a perfect statistical graph.  Elements of a statistical graph Before we dive into Python code, l will give you an overview of how to decompose the  components of a statistical graph. I personally think the philosophy that embeds the R  ggplot2 package is very concise and clear.   Note R is another famous programming language for data science and statistical  analysis. There are also successful R packages. The counterpart of Matplotlib is  the R ggplot2 package mentioned previously.   ggplot2 is a very successful visualization tool developed by Hadley Wickman.   It decomposes a statistical plot into the following three components:     Data: The data must have the information to display; otherwise, the plotting   becomes totally misleading. The data can be transformed, such as with  categorization, before being visualized.     Geometries: Geometry here means the types of plotting. For example, bar plot, pie  plot, boxplot, and scatter plot are all different types of plotting. Different geometries  are suitable for different visualization purposes.     Aesthetics: The size, shape, color, and positioning of visual elements, such as the  title, ticks, and legends, all belong to aesthetics. A coherent collection of aesthetic  elements can be bundled together as a theme. For example, Facebook and The  Economist have very distinguishable graphical themes.   Basic examples with the Python Matplotlib package      55  Let's use the birth rate and death rate data for Texas counties grouped by urbanization  level as an example. Before that, let's relate this data with the three components   mentioned previously:     The data is the birth rate and death rate data, which determines the location of the   scattered points.     The geometry is a scatter plot. If you use a line plot, you are using the wrong type of   plot because there isn't a natural ordering structure in the dataset.     There are many aesthetic elements, but the most important ones are the size and   the color of the spots. How they are determined will be detailed when we reach the  second section of this chapter.  Incorporating this data into a graph gives a result that would look something like this:  Figure 3.1 – Example for elements of statistical graphing   56     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Geometry is built upon data, and the aesthetics will only make sense if you have the   right data and geometry. In this chapter, you can assume we already have the right data.   If you have the wrong data, you will end up with graphs that make no sense and are   oftentimes misleading. In this section, let's focus mainly on geometry. In the following sections, I will talk about  how to transform data and customize aesthetics.  Exploring important types of plotting in Matplotlib Let's first explore the most important plotting types one by one.  Simple line plots A simple line plot is the easiest type of plotting. It represents only a binary mapping  relationship between two ordered sets. Stock price versus date is an example; temperature  versus time is another.  The following code snippet generates a list of evenly spaced numbers and their sine and  plots them. Please note that the libraries only need to be imported once:  import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline fig = plt.figure   x = np.linspace 0, 10, 1000  plt.plot x, np.sin x  ;  This generates the following output:     Figure 3.2 – A simple line plot of the sine function   Basic examples with the Python Matplotlib package      57  You can add one or two more simple line plots; Matplotlib will decide the default color of  the lines for you. The following snippet will add two more trigonometric functions:  fig = plt.figure figsize= 10,8   x = np.linspace 0, 10, 100  plt.plot x, np.sin x ,linestyle=":",linewidth=4  plt.plot x,np.cos x ,linestyle="--",linewidth=4  plt.plot x,np.cos 2*x ,linestyle="-.",linewidth=4 ;  Different sets of data are plotted with dashed lines, dotted lines, and dashed-dotted lines,  as shown in the following figure:  Figure 3.3 – Multiple simple line plots  Now that we have understood a simple line plot, let's move on to the next type of plotting  – a histogram plot.   58     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Histogram plots We used a histogram plot extensively in the previous chapter. This type of plot groups data  into bins and shows the counts of data points in each bin with neighboring bars. The following code snippet demonstrates a traditional one-dimensional histogram plot:  x1 = np.random.laplace 0, 0.8, 500  x2 = np.random.normal 3, 2, 500  plt.hist x1, alpha=0.5, density=True, bins=20  plt.hist x2, alpha=0.5, density=True, bins=20 ;  The following output shows the histogram plots overlapping each other:   Figure 3.4 – A one-dimensional histogram  Here, density is normalized, so the histogram is no longer a frequency count but a  probability count. The transparency level, the alpha value, is set to 0.5, so the histogram  underline is displayed properly.  Boxplot and outlier detection A two-dimensional histogram plot is especially helpful for visualizing correlations  between two quantities. We will be using the immigration data we used in the Classifying  numerical and categorical variables section in Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data  Assessment, as an example.    Basic examples with the Python Matplotlib package      59  The good thing about a boxplot is that it gives us a very good estimation of the existence  of outliers. The following code snippet plots the Texas counties' net immigration rate of  2017 in a boxplot:  import pandas as pd df = pd.read_excel "PopulationEstimates.xls",skiprows=2  dfTX = df[df["State"]=="TX"].tail -1  plt.boxplot dfTX['R_NET_MIG_2017'] ;  The plot looks as in the following figure:  Figure 3.5 – A boxplot of the 2017 net immigration rate of Texas counties   What we generated is a simple boxplot. It has a box with a horizontal line in between.  There are minimum and maximum data points, which are represented as short horizontal  lines. However, there are also data points above the maximum and below the minimum.  You may also wonder what they are since there are already maximum and minimum data  points. We will solve these issues one by one. Let's understand the box first. The top and bottom of the box are the ¾ quartile and the  ¼ quartile, respectively. This means exactly 50% of the data is in the box. The distance  between the ¼ quartile and the ¾ quartile is called the Interquartile Range  IQR .  Clearly, the shorter the box is, the more centralized the data points are. The orange line in  the middle represents the median.   60     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  The position of the maximum is worked out as the sum of the ¾ quartile and 1.5 times the  IQR. The minimum is worked out as the difference between the ¼ quartile and 1.5 times  the IQR. What still lies outside of the range are considered outliers. In the preceding  boxplot, there are four outliers. For example, if the distribution is normal, a data point  being an outlier has a probability of roughly 0.7%, which is small.  Note A boxplot offers you a visual approach to detect outliers. In the preceding  example, 1.5 times the IQR is not a fixed rule, and you can choose a cut-off for  specific tasks.   Scatter plots A scatter plot is very useful for visually inspecting correlations between variables. It is  especially helpful to display data at a different time or date from different locations in the  same graph. Readers usually find it difficult to tell minute distribution differences from  numerical values, but a scatter plot makes them easy to spot. For example, let's plot the birth rate and death rate for all the Texas counties in 2013  and 2017. It becomes somewhat clear that from 2013 to 2017, some data points with the  highest death rate disappear, while the birth rates remain unchanged. The following code  snippet does the job:  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.scatter dfTX.R_birth_2013,dfTX.R_ death_2013,alpha="0.5",label="2013"  plt.scatter dfTX.R_birth_2017,dfTX.R_ death_2017,alpha="0.5",label="2017"  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "Birth Rate"  plt.ylabel "Death Rate"  plt.title "Texas Counties Birth Death Rates" ;   Basic examples with the Python Matplotlib package      61  The output looks as in the following figure:  Figure 3.6 – A scatter plot of the birth rate and death rate in Texas counties  Note The scatter plot shown in Figure 3.6 doesn't reveal one-to-one dynamics.  For example, we don't know the change in the birth rate or death rate of a  specific county, and it is possible, though unlikely, that county A and county B  exchanged their positions in the scatter plot. Therefore, a basic scatter plot only  gives us distribution-wise information, but no more than that.   62     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Bar plots A bar plot is another common plot to demonstrate trends and compare several quantities  side by side. It is better than a simple line chart because sometimes line charts can be  misleading without careful interpretation.  For example, say I want to see the birth rate and death rate data for Anderson County in  Texas from 2011 to 2018. The following short code snippet would prepare the column  masks to select features and examine the first row of the DataFrame, which is the data for  Anderson County:  birthRates = list filter lambda x: x.startswith "R_ birth" ,dfTX.columns   deathRates = list filter lambda x: x.startswith "R_ death" ,dfTX.columns   years = np.array list map lambda x: int x[-4:] , birthRates     The Anderson County information can be obtained by using the iloc method, as shown  in the following snippet:  dfTX.iloc[0]  Figure 3.7 shows the first several columns and the last several ones of the Anderson  County data:  Figure 3.7 – Anderson County data  Note DataFrame.iloc[] in pandas allows you to slice a DataFrame by the  index field.   Basic examples with the Python Matplotlib package      63  The following code snippet generates a simple line plot:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   width=0.4 plt.plot years-width 2, dfTX.iloc[0][birthRates], label= "birth  rate"  plt.plot years+width 2, dfTX.iloc[0][deathRates],label="death  rate"  plt.xlabel "years"  plt.ylabel "rate"  plt.legend   plt.title "Anderson County birth rate and death rate" ;  The following figure shows the output, which is a simple line plot with the dotted line  being the birth rate and the dashed line being the death rate, by default:     Figure 3.8 – A line chart of the birth rate and death rate  Without carefully reading it, you can derive two pieces of information from the plot:     The death rates change dramatically across the years.    The death rates are much higher than the birth rates.   64     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Even though the y - axis tick doesn't support the two claims presented, admit it, this is the  first impression we get without careful observation.  However, with a bar plot, this illusion can be eliminated early. The following code snippet  will help in generating a bar plot:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   width=0.4 plt.bar years-width 2, dfTX.iloc[0][birthRates],         width=width, label= «birth rate», alpha = 1  plt.bar years+width 2, dfTX.iloc[0][deathRates],         width=width,label="death rate", alpha = 1  plt.xlabel "years"  plt.ylabel "rate"  plt.legend   plt.title "Anderson County birth rate and death rate" ;  I slightly shifted year to be the X value and selected birthRates and deathRates  with the iloc[] method we introduced earlier. The result will look as shown in   Figure 3.9:  Figure 3.9 – A bar plot of the Anderson County data   Advanced visualization customization     65  The following is now much clearer:     The death rate is higher than the birth rate but not as dramatically as the line    plot suggests.     The rates do not change dramatically across the years, except in 2014.  The bar plot will, by default, show the whole scale of the data, therefore eliminating the  earlier illusion. Note how I used the width parameter to shift the two sets of bars so that they can be  properly positioned.   Advanced visualization customization In this section, you are going to learn how to customize the plots from two perspectives,  the geometry and the aesthetics. You will see examples and understand how the  customization works.  Customizing the geometry There isn't enough time nor space to cover every detail of geometry customization. Let's  learn by understanding and following examples instead.  Example 1 – axis-sharing and subplots Continuing from the previous example, let's say you want the birth rate and the  population change to be plotted on the same graph. However, the numerical values of the  two quantities are drastically different, making the birth rate basically indistinguishable.  There are two ways to solve this issue. Let's look at each of the ways individually.  Axis-sharing We can make use of both the left-hand y axis and the right-hand Y axis to represent  different scales. The following code snippet copies the axes with the twinx   function,  which is the key of the whole code block:  figure, ax1 = plt.subplots figsize= 10,6   ax1.plot years, dfTX.iloc[0][birthRates], label= "birth  rate",c="red"  ax2 = ax1.twinx   ax2.plot years, dfTX.iloc[0][popChanges][1:], label="population  change"    66     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  ax1.set_xlabel "years"  ax1.set_ylabel "birth rate"  ax2.set_ylabel "population change"  ax1.legend   ax2.legend   plt.title "Anderson County birth rate and population change" ;  As you can see, the preceding code snippet does three things, in order:  1.  Creates a figure instance and an axis instance, ax1 2.  Creates a twin of ax1 and plots the two sets of data on two different axes 3.  Creates labels for two different axes, shows the legend, sets the title, and so on  The following is the output:  The output looks nice, and both trends are clearly visible.  Figure 3.10 – Double Y axes example  Subplots With subplots, we can also split the two graphs into two subplots. The following code  snippet creates two stacked subplots and plots the dataset on them separately:   Advanced visualization customization     67  figure, axes = plt.subplots 2,1,figsize= 10,6   axes[0].plot years, dfTX.iloc[0][birthRates], label= "birth  rate",c="red"  axes[1].plot years, dfTX.iloc[0][popChanges][1:],  label="population change"  axes[1].set_xlabel "years"  axes[0].set_ylabel "birth rate"  axes[1].set_ylabel "population change"  axes[0].legend   axes[1].legend   axes[0].set_title "Anderson County birth rate and population  change" ;  Note The subplots function takes 2 and 1 as two arguments. This means the  layout will have 2 rows but 1 column. So, the axes will be a two-element list.  The output of the previous code will look as follows:  Figure 3.11 – Birth rate and population subplots example   68     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  The two plots will adjust the scale of the Y axis automatically. The advantage of using  subplots over a shared axis is that subplots can support the addition of more complicated  markups, while a shared axis is already crowded.  Example 2 – scale change In this second example, we will be using the dataset for the total number of coronavirus  cases in the world published by WHO. At the time of writing this book, the latest data  I could obtain was from March 15, 2020. You can also obtain the data from the official  repository of this book. The following code snippet loads the data and formats the date column into a date   data type:  coronaCases = pd.read_csv "total_cases_03_15_2020.csv"  from datetime import datetime coronaCases["date"] = coronaCases["date"].apply lambda x:  datetime.strptime x, "%Y-%m-%d"    Then, we plot the data for the world and the US. The output of the previous code snippet  will look like this:   Advanced visualization customization     69  Figure 3.12 – Coronavirus cases in linear and log scales  Note how I changed the second subplot from a linear scale to a log scale. Can you work  out the advantage of doing so? On a linear scale, because the cases in the world are much larger than the cases in the US,  the representation of cases in the US is basically a horizontal line, and the details in the  total case curve at the early stage are not clear. In the log-scale plot, the Y axis changes to a  logarithm scale, so exponential growth becomes a somewhat linear line, and the numbers  in the US are visible now.   70     Visualization with Statistical Graphs Customizing the aesthetics Details are important, and they can guide us to focus on the right spot. Here, I use one  example to show the importance of aesthetics, specifically the markers. A good choice of  markers can help readers notice the most important information you want to convey.  Example – markers Suppose you want to visualize the birth rate and death rate for counties in Texas but also  want to inspect the rates against the total population and rural_urban_continuum_ code for a specific year.  In short, you have four quantities to inspect, so which geometry will you choose and how  will you represent the quantities?  Note  The continuum code is a discrete variable, but the other three are continuous  variables. To represent a discrete variable that doesn't have numerical  relationships between categories, you should choose colors or markers over  others, which may suggest numerical differences.  A naïve choice is a scatter plot, as we did earlier. This is shown in the following   code snippet:   plt.figure figsize= 12,6   plt.scatter dfTX.R_birth_2013,             dfTX.R_death_2013,             alpha=0.4,             s = dfTX.POP_ESTIMATE_2013 1000,               plt.xlabel "Birth Rate"  plt.ylabel "Death Rate"  plt.title "Texas Counties Birth Death Rates in 2013" ;  Note that I set the s parameter, the size of the default marker, to be 1 unit for every   1,000 of the population.   The output already looks very informative:  Advanced visualization customization     71  Figure 3.13 – The birth rate and death rate in Texas  However, this is probably not enough because we can't tell whether the region is a rural  area or an urban area. To do this, we need to introduce a color map.   Note A color map maps a feature to a set of colors. In Matplotlib, there are many  different color maps. For a complete list of maps, check the official document  at https:  matplotlib.org 3.2.0 tutorials colors  colormaps.html.  The following code snippet maps rural_urban_continuum_code to colors and  plots the color bar. Although the code itself is numerical, the color bar ticks contain no  numerical meaning:  plt.figure figsize= 12,6   plt.scatter dfTX.R_birth_2013,             dfTX.R_death_2013,             alpha=0.4,             s = dfTX.POP_ESTIMATE_2013 1000,             c= dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2003»],             cmap =  'Dark2',                 72     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  plt.colorbar   plt.xlabel "Birth Rate"  plt.ylabel "Death Rate"  plt.title "Texas Counties Birth Death Rates in 2013" ;  The output looks much easier to interpret:  Figure 3.14 – The birth rate and death rate in Texas  revised   From this plotting, counties with smaller code numbers have a bigger population, a  relatively moderate birth rate, but a lower death rate. This is possibly due to the age  structure because cities are more likely to attract younger people. This information can't  be revealed without adjusting the aesthetics of the graph.  Query-oriented statistical plotting The visualization should always be guided by business queries. In the previous section, we  saw the relationship between birth and death rates, population, and code, and with that,  we designed how the graph should look.    Query-oriented statistical plotting     73  In this section, we will see two more examples. The first example is about preprocessing  data to meet the requirement of the plotting API in the seaborn library. In the second  example, we will integrate simple statistical analysis into plotting, which will also serve as  a teaser for our next chapter.  Example 1 – preparing data to fit the plotting   function API seaborn is another popular Python visualization library. With it, you can write less code  to obtain more professional-looking plots. Some APIs are different, though. Let's plot a boxplot. You can check the official documentation at https:  seaborn. pydata.org generated seaborn.boxplot.html. Let's try to use it to plot the  birth rates from different years for Texas counties. However, if you look at the DataFrame that the seaborn library imported, it looks  different from what we used earlier:  import seaborn as sns tips = sns.load_dataset "tips"  tips.head    The output looks as follows:  Figure 3.15 – Head of tips, a seaborn built-in dataset   The syntax of plotting a boxplot is shown in the following snippet:  ax = sns.boxplot x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips    74     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  The output is as follows:  Figure 3.16 – The seaborn tips boxplot  Note It is hard to generate such a beautiful boxplot with one-line code using the  Matplotlib library. There is always a trade-off between control and easiness. In  my opinion, seaborn is a good choice if you have limited time for your tasks.  Notice that the x parameter, day, is a column name in the tips DataFrame, and it can  take several values: Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sun. However, in the Texas county data,   records for each year are separated as different columns, which is much wider than the  tidy tips DataFrame. To convert a wide table into a long table, we need the pandas melt function: https:   pandas.pydata.org pandas-docs stable reference api pandas. melt.html.   Query-oriented statistical plotting     75  The following code snippet selects the birth rate-related columns and transforms the table  into a longer, thinner format:  birthRatesDF = dfTX[birthRates] birthRatesDF["index"] = birthRatesDF.index; birthRatesDFLong = pd.melt birthRatesDF,id_ vars=["index"],value_vars = birthRatesDF.columns[:-1]  birthRatesDFLong["variable"] = birthRatesDFLong["variable"]. apply lambda x: int x[-4:]    The long-format table now looks as in the following figure:  Now, the seaborn API can be used directly, as follows:  Figure 3.17 – Long format of the birth rates data  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   sns.boxplot x="variable", y="value", data=birthRatesDFLong  plt.xlabel "Year"  plt.ylabel "Birth Rates" ;   76     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  The following will be the output:  Figure 3.18 – Texas counties' birth rates boxplot with the seaborn API  Nice, isn't it? You've learned how to properly transform the data into the formats that the  library APIs accept. Good job!  Example 2 – combining analysis with plain plotting In the second example, you will see how one-line code can add inference flavor to your  plots. Suppose you want to examine the birth rate and the natural population increase rate  in the year 2017 individually, but you also want to check whether there is some correlation  between the two.  To summarize, we need to do the following:  1.  Examine the individual distributions of each quantity. 2.  Examine the correlation between these two quantities. 3.  Obtain a mathematical visual representation of the two quantities.   Query-oriented statistical plotting     77  seaborn offers the jointplot function, which you can make use of. It enables you to  combine univariate plots and bivariate plots. It also allows you to add annotations with  statistical implications. The following code snippet shows the univariate distribution, bivariate scatter plot,   an estimate of univariate density, and bivariate linear regression information in   one command:  g = sns.jointplot "R_NATURAL_INC_2017", "R_birth_2017",  data=dfTX, kind="reg",height=10   The following graph shows the output:  Figure 3.19 – Joint plot of a scatter plot and histogram plot example   78     Visualization with Statistical Graphs  Tip By adding inference information, density estimation, and the linear regression  part to an exploratory graph, we can make the visualization very professional.  Presentation-ready plotting tips Here are some tips if you plan to use plots in your professional work.  Use styling Consider using the following tips to style plots:     You should consider using a style that accommodates your PowerPoint or slides. For  example, if your presentation contains a lot of grayscale elements, you shouldn't use  colorful plots.     You should keep styling consistent across the presentation or report.     You should avoid using markups that are too fancy.    Be aware of the fact that sometimes people only have grayscale printing, so red and   green may be indistinguishable. Use different markers and textures in this case.  For example, the following code replots the joint plot in grayscale style:   with plt.style.context 'grayscale' :     plt.figure figsize= 12,6       g = sns.jointplot "R_NATURAL_INC_2017", "R_birth_2017",  data=dfTX, kind="reg",height=10    The result is as follows:  Presentation-ready plotting tips     79  Figure 3.20 – Replot with grayscale style   80     Visualization with Statistical Graphs Font matters a lot Before the end of this chapter, I would like to share my tips for font choice aesthetics:     Font size is very important. It makes a huge difference. What you see on a screen   can be very different from what you see on paper or on a projector screen. For  example, you can use plt.rc 'ytick', labelsize='x-medium'  to  specify the xtick size of your graph.     Be aware that the font size usually won't scale when the graph scales. You should   test it and set it explicitly, if necessary.     Font family is also important. The font family of graphs should match the font of the   paper. Serif is the most common one. Use the following code to change the default  fonts to serif: plt.rc 'font', family='serif' .  Let's summarize what we have learned in this chapter.  Summary In this chapter, we discussed the most important plots in Python. Different plots suit  different purposes, and you should choose them accordingly. The default settings of each  plot may not be perfect for your needs, so customizations are necessary. You also learned  the importance of choosing the right geometries and aesthetics to avoid problems in  your dataset, such as significant quantity imbalance or highlighting features to make an  exploratory argument.  Business queries are the starting point of designing a statistical plot. We discussed  the necessity of transforming data to fit a function API and choosing proper plotting  functions to answer queries without hassle. In the next chapter, let's look at some probability distributions. After all, both the  histogram plot and the density estimation plot in a joint plot try to uncover the probability  distributions behind the dataset.    Section 2:   Essentials of  Statistical Analysis  Section 2 covers the most fundamental and classical contents of statistical analysis at the  undergraduate level. However, the statistical analysis we'll get into is applied to messy   real-word datasets. This section will give you a taste of statistical analysis as well as  sharpening your math skills for further chapters. This section consists of the following chapters:     Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics    Chapter 5, Common Probability Distributions    Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation    Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing    4 Sampling and  Inferential Statistics  In this chapter, we focus on several difficult sampling techniques and basic inferential  statistics associated with each of them. This chapter is crucial because in real life, the data  we have is, most likely, only a small portion of a whole set. Sometimes, we also need to  perform sampling on a given large dataset. Common reasons for sampling are listed   as follows:     The analysis can run quicker when the dataset is small.    Your model doesn't benefit much from having gazillions of pieces of data.  Sometimes, you also don't want sampling. For example, sampling a small dataset with  sub-categories may be detrimental. Understanding how sampling works will help you to  avoid various kinds of pitfalls. The following topics will be covered in this chapter:     Understanding fundamental concepts in sampling techniques    Performing proper sampling under different scenarios    Understanding statistics associated with sampling   84     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  We begin by clarifying the concepts.  Understanding fundamental concepts in  sampling techniques In Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, I emphasized that statistics such  as mean and variance were used to describe the population. The intent is to help you  distinguish between the population and samples. With a population at hand, the  information is complete, which means all statistics you calculated will be authentic since  you have everything. With a sample, the information you have only relates to a small  portion, or a subset of the population. What exactly is a population? A population is the whole set of entities under study. If you want to study the average  monthly income of all American women, then the population includes every woman in  the United States. Population will change if the study or the question changes. If the study  is about finding the average monthly income of all Los Angeles women, then a subset of  the population for the previous study becomes the whole population of the current study. Certain populations are accessible for a study. For example, it probably only takes 1 hour  to measure kids' weights in a single kindergarten. However, it is both economically and  temporally impractical to obtain income information for American women or even Los  Angeles women. In order to get a good estimate of such an answer, sampling is required. A sample is a subset of the population under study. The process of obtaining a sample is  called sampling. For example, you could select 1,000 Los Angeles women and make this  your sample. By collecting their income information, you can infer the average income of  all Los Angeles women.  As you may imagine, selecting 1,000 people will likely give us a more confident estimation  of the statistics. The sampling size matters because more entries will increase the  likelihood of representing more characteristics of the original population. What is more important is the way how sampling is done. if you randomly select people  walking on the street in Hollywood, you probably will significantly overestimate the true  average income. If you go to a college campus to interview students, you will likely find an  underestimated statistic because students won't have a high income in general.    Understanding fundamental concepts in sampling techniques     85  Another related concept is the accessible population. The whole population under  study is also referred to as the target population, which is supposed to be the set to  study. However, sometimes only part of it is accessible. The key characteristic is that the  sampling process is restricted by accessibility. As regards a study of the income of all Los  Angeles women, an accessible population may be very small. Even for a small accessible  population, researchers or survey conductors can only sample a small portion of it. This  makes the sampling process crucially important.  Failed sampling Failed sampling can lead to disastrous decision making. For example, in  earlier times when phones were not very accessible to every family, if political  polling was conducted based on phone directories, the result could be wildly  inaccurate. The fact of having a phone indicated a higher household income,  and their political choices may not reveal the characteristics of the whole  community or region. In the 1936 Presidential election between Roosevelt  and Landon, such a mistake resulted in an infamous false Republican victory  prediction by Literary Digest.  In the next section, you will learn some of the most important sampling methods. We will  still be using the Texas population data. For your reference, the following code snippet  reads the dataset and creates the dfTX DataFrame:  import pandas as pd df = pd.read_excel "PopulationEstimates.xls",skiprows=2  dfTX = df[df["State"]=="TX"].tail -1   The first several columns of the dfTX DataFrame appear as follows:  Figure 4.1 – First several columns of the dfTX DataFrame  Next, let's see how different samplings are done.   86     Sampling and Inferential Statistics Performing proper sampling under   different scenarios The previous section introduced an example of misleading sampling in political polling.  The correctness of a sampling approach will change depending on its content. When  telephones were not accessible, polling by phone was a bad practice. However, now  everyone has a phone number associated with them and, in general, the phone number  is largely random. If a polling agency generates a random phone number and makes  calls, the bias is likely to be small. You should keep in mind that the standard of judging a  sampling method as right or wrong should always depend on the scenario. There are two major ways of sampling: probability sampling and non-probability  sampling. Refer to the following details:      Probability sampling, as the name suggests, involves random selection. In   probability sampling, each member has an equal and known chance of being  selected. This theoretically guarantees that the results obtained will ultimately reveal  the behavior of the population.      Non-probability sampling, where subjective sampling decisions are made by the   researchers. The sampling process is usually more convenient though.  The dangers associated with non-probability sampling Yes. Here I do indeed refer to non-probability sampling as being dangerous, and I am not  wrong. Here I list the common ways of performing non-probability sampling and we will  discuss each in detail:     Convenience sampling    Volunteer sampling    Purposive sampling  There are two practical reasons why people turn to non-probability sampling.  Non-probability sampling is convenient. It usually costs much less to obtain an initial  exploratory result with non-probability sampling than probability sampling. For example,  you can distribute shopping surveys in a supermarket parking lot to get a sense of people's  shopping habits on a Saturday evening. But your results will likely change if you do it on  a Monday morning. For example, people might tend to buy more alcohol at the weekend.  Such sampling is called convenience sampling.   Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      87  Convenience sampling is widely used in a pilot experiment study. It can avoid wasting  study resources on improper directions or find hidden issues at the early stages of study. It  is considered unsuitable for a major study. Two other common non-probability sampling methods are volunteer sampling and  purposive sampling. Volunteer sampling relies on the participants' own self-selection to  join the sampling. A purposive selection is highly judgmental and subjective such that  researchers will manually choose participants as part of the sample. A typical example of volunteer sampling is a survey conducted by a political figure with  strong left- or right-wing tendencies. Usually, only their supporters will volunteer to  spend time taking the survey and the results will be highly biased, tending to support this  person's political ideas. An exaggerated or even hilarious example of purposive sampling is asking people whether  they successfully booked a plane ticket on the plane. The result is obvious because it is  done on the plane. You may notice that such sampling techniques are widely and deliberately used in  everyday life, such as in commercials or political campaigns, in an extremely disrespectful  way. Many surveys conclude the results before they were performed.  Be careful with non-probability sampling Non-probability sampling is not wrong. It is widely used. For inexperienced  researchers or data scientists who are not familiar with the domain knowledge,  it is very easy to make mistakes with non-probability sampling. The non- probability sampling method should be justified carefully to avoid mistakes  such as ignoring the fact that people who own a car or a telephone in 1936 were  likely Republican.  In the next section, you are going to learn how to perform sampling safely. Also, since  probability sampling doesn't involve much subjective judgement, you are going to see  some working code again.   88     Sampling and Inferential Statistics Probability sampling – the safer approach I refer to probability sampling as a safer sampling approach because it avoids serious  distribution distortion due to human intervention in most cases. Here I introduce three  ways of probability sampling. They are systematic and objective, and are therefore more  likely to lead to unbiased results. We will spend more time on them. As before, I will list  them first:     Simple random sampling    Stratified random sampling    Systematic random sampling  Let's start with simple random sampling.  Simple random sampling The first probability sampling is Simple Random Sampling  SRS . Let's say we have a study that aims to find the mean and standard deviation of the  counties' populations in Texas. If it is not possible to perform this in all counties in Texas,  simple random sampling can be done to select a certain percentage of counties in Texas. The following code shows the total number of counties and plots their population  distributions. The following code selects 10%, which is 25 counties, of all of all the counties' populations  in 2018. First, let's take a look at our whole dataset's distribution:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.hist dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"],bins=100  plt.title "Total number of counties: {}".format len dfTX["POP_ ESTIMATE_2018"]    plt.axvline np.mean dfTX["POP_ ESTIMATE_2018"] ,c="r",linestyle="--"  plt.xlabel "Population"  plt.ylabel "Count" ;   Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      89  The result is a highly skewed distribution with few very large population outliers. The  dashed line indicates the position of the mean:  Figure 4.2 – Population histogram plotting of all 254 Texas counties  Most counties have populations of below half a million and fewer than 5 counties have  population in excess of 2 million. The population mean is 112,999, according to the following one-line code:  np.mean dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"]   Now, let's use the random.sample   function from the random module to select 25  non-repetitive samples and plot the distribution. To make the result reproducible, I set the  random seed to be 2020.  Note on reproducibility To make your analysis such that it involves reproducible randomness, set a  random seed so that randomness becomes deterministic.  The following code snippet selects 25 counties' data and calculates the mean   population figure:  random.seed 2020  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   sample = random.sample dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_list  ,25  plt.hist sample,bins=100  plt.axvline np.mean sample ,c="r"  plt.title "Mean of sample population: {}".format np. mean sample      90     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  plt.xlabel "Population"  plt.ylabel "Count" ;  The result appears as follows. Notice that the sample's mean is about 50% smaller than the  population's mean:  Figure 4.3 – Simple random sample results  We can do this several more times to check the results since the sampling will be different  each time. The following code snippet calculates the mean of the sample 100 times and  visualizes the distribution of the sampled mean. I initialize the random seed so that it  becomes reproducible. The following code snippet repeats the SRS process 100 times and calculates the mean  for each repetition. Then, plot the histogram of the means. I call the number of occasions   100  trials, and the size of each sample  25  numSample:  numSample = 25 trials = 100 random.seed 2020  sampleMeans = [] for i in range trials :     sample = random.sample dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_ list  ,numSample      sampleMeans.append np.mean sample   plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.hist sampleMeans,bins=25  plt.title "Distribution of the {} sample means for sample size    Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      91  of {}".format trials, numSample   plt.gca  .xaxis.set_tick_params rotation=45  plt.xlabel "Sample Mean"  plt.ylabel "Count" ;  The result looks somewhat like the original distribution of the population:  Figure 4.4 – Distribution of the mean of 100 SRS processes  However, the distribution shape will change drastically if you modify the sample size or  number of trials. Let me first demonstrate the change in sample size. In the following code  snippet, the number of samples takes values of 25 and 100 and the number of trials is  1000. Note that the distribution is normed, so the scale becomes comparable:  numSamples = [25,100] colors = ["r","b"] trials = 1000 random.seed 2020  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   sampleMeans = [] for j in range len numSamples  :     for i in range trials :         sample = random.sample dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_ list  ,numSamples[j]          sampleMeans.append np.mean sample       plt.hist sampleMeans,color=colors[j],  alpha=0.5,bins=25,label="sample size: {}".   92     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  format numSamples[j] ,density=True  plt.legend   plt.title "Distribution density of means of 1000 SRS, \nwith  respect to sample sizes"  plt.xlabel "Sample Mean"  plt.ylabel "Density" ;  You can clearly see the influence of sample size on the result in the following graph:  Figure 4.5 – Demonstration of the influence of sample size  In short, if you choose a bigger sample size, it is more likely that you will obtain a larger  estimation of the mean of the population data. It is not counter-intuitive because the  mean is very susceptible to extreme values. With a larger sample size, the extreme values,  those > 1 million, are more likely to be selected and therefore increase the chance that the  sample mean is large.   Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      93  I will leave it to you to examine the influence of the number of trials. You can run the  following code snippet to find out. The number of trials should only influence accuracy:  numSample = 100 colors = ["r","b"] trials = [1000,5000] random.seed 2020  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   sampleMeans = [] for j in range len trials  :     for i in range trials[j] :         sample = random.sample dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_ list  ,numSample          sampleMeans.append np.mean sample       plt.hist sampleMeans,color=colors[j],  alpha=0.5,bins=25,label="trials: {}". format trials[j] ,density=True  plt.legend  ; plt.title "Distribution density of means of 1000 SRS and 5000  SRS"  plt.xlabel "Sample Mean"  plt.ylabel "Density" ;  Most of the code is the same as the previous one, except the number of trials now takes  another value, that is, 5000 in line 3.  Stratified random sampling Another common method of probability sampling is stratified random sampling.  Stratifying is a process of aligning or arranging something into categories or groups.  In stratified random sampling, you should first classify or group the population into  categories and then select elements from each group randomly. The advantage of stratified random sampling is that every group is guaranteed to be  represented in the final sample. Sometimes this is important. For example, if you want to  sample the income of American women without SRS, it is likely that most samples will  fall into high-population states such as California and Texas. Information about small  states will be completely lost. Sometimes you want to sacrifice the absolute equal chance to  include the representativeness.   94     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  For the Texas county population data, we want to include all counties from different  urbanization levels. The following code snippet examines the urbanization code   level distribution:  from collections import Counter Counter dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum Code_2013"]   The result shows some imbalance:  Counter {7.0: 39,          6.0: 65,          5.0: 6,          2.0: 25,          3.0: 22,          1.0: 35,          8.0: 20,          9.0: 29,          4.0: 13}   If we want equal representativeness from each urbanization group, such as two elements  from each group, stratified random sampling is likely the only way to do it. In SRS, the  level 5 data will have a very low chance of being sampled. Think about the choice between sampling equal numbers of entries in each level strata   or a proportional number of entries as a choice between selecting senators and   House representatives.   Note In the United States, each state has two senators, regardless of the population  and state size. The number of representatives in the House reflects how large  the state's population is. The larger the population, the more representatives the  state has in the House.  The following code snippet samples four representatives from each urbanization level  and prints out the mean. Note that the code is not optimized for performance but for  readability:  random.seed 2020  samples = [] for level in sorted np.unique dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum  Code_2013"]  :   Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      95      samples += random.sample dfTX[dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum  Code_2013"]==level]["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_list  ,4  print np.mean samples    The result is about 144010, so not bad. Let's do this four more times and check the distribution of the sample mean. The  following code snippet performs stratified random sampling 1,000 times and plots the  distribution of means:  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.hist sampleMeans,bins=25 ; plt.title "Sample mean distribution, with stratified random  sampling "  plt.gca  .xaxis.set_tick_params rotation=45  plt.xlabel "Sample Mean"  plt.ylabel "Count" ;  The following results convey some important information. As you can tell, the sampled  means are pretty much centered around the true mean of the population:     Figure 4.6 – Distribution of sample means from stratified random sampling   96     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  To clarify the origin of this odd shape, you need to check the mean of each group. The  following code snippet does the job:  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   levels = [] codeMeans = [] for level in sorted np.unique dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum  Code_2013"]  :     codeMean = np.mean dfTX[dfTX["Rural-urban_Continuum  Code_2013"]==level]["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"]      levels.append level      codeMeans.append codeMean  plt.plot levels,codeMeans,marker=10,markersize=20  plt.title "Urbanization level code versus mean population"  plt.xlabel "Urbanization level code  2013 "  plt.ylabel "Population mean" ;  The result looks like the following:   Figure 4.7 – Urbanization level code versus the mean population  Note that the larger the urbanization level code, the smaller the mean population.  Stratified random sampling takes samples from each group, so an improved performance  is not surprising.   Performing proper sampling under different scenarios      97  Recall that the urbanization level is a categorical variable, as we introduced it in Chapter  2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment. The previous graph is for visualization purposes  only. It doesn't tell us information such as that the urbanization difference between levels  3 and 2 is the same as the difference between levels 5 and 6. Also notice that it is important to choose a correct stratifying criterion. For example,  classifying counties into different levels based on the first letter in a county name doesn't  make sense here.  Systematic random sampling The last probability sampling method is likely the easiest one. If the population has an  order structure, you can first select one at random, and then select every n-th member  after it. For example, you can sample the students by ID on campus or select households  by address number. The following code snippet takes every tenth of the Texas dataset and calculates the mean:  random.seed 2020  idx = random.randint 0,10  populations = dfTX["POP_ESTIMATE_2018"].to_list   samples = [] samples.append populations[idx]  while idx + 10 < len populations :     idx += 10     samples.append populations[idx]  print np.mean samples    The result is 158799, so not bad. Systematic random sampling is easy to implement and understand. It naturally avoids  potential clustering in the data. However, it assumes a natural randomness in the dataset  such that manipulation of the data may cause false results. Also, you have to know the size  of the population beforehand in order to determine a sampling interval. We have covered three ways of probability sampling. Combining previous non-probability  sampling techniques, you have six methods at your disposal. Each of the sampling  techniques has its own pros and cons. Choose wisely in different cases. In the next section,  we will study some statistics associated with sampling techniques that will help us make  such decisions.   98     Sampling and Inferential Statistics Understanding statistics associated   with sampling In the previous section, you saw something like a histogram plot of the samples' means.  We used the histogram to show the quality of the sampled mean. If the distribution of the  mean is centered around the true mean, I claim it has a better quality. In this section, we  will go deeper into it. Instead of using Texas population data, I will be using artificial uniform distributions as  examples. It should be easier for you to grasp the quantitative intuition if the distribution  underlining the population is clear.  Sampling distribution of the sample mean You have seen the distribution of the sampled mean in the previous section. There are  some questions remaining. For example, what is the systematic relationship between the  sample size and the sample mean? What is the relationship between the number of times  of sampling and the sample mean's distribution?  Assume we have a population that can only take values from integers 1 to 10 with equal  probability. The population is very large, so we can sample as many as we want. Let me  perform an experiment by setting the sample size to 4 and then calculate the sample  mean. Let's do the sampling 100 times and check the distribution of the sample   mean. We did similar computational experiments for the Texas population data,   but here you can obtain the theoretical mean and standard deviation of the uniform  distribution beforehand. The theoretical mean and standard deviation of the distribution can be calculated in   one line:  print np.mean [i for i in range 1,11 ]   print np.sqrt np.mean [ i-5.5 **2 for i in range 1,11 ]     The mean is 5.5 and the standard deviation is about 2.87.  The following code snippet performs the computational experiment and plots the  distribution of the sample mean:  trials = 100 sampleSize = 4 random.seed 2020  sampleMeans = [] candidates = [i for i in range 1,11 ]   Understanding statistics associated with sampling      99  plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 18}  for i in range trials :     sampleMean = np.mean [random.choice candidates  for _ in  range sampleSize ]      sampleMeans.append sampleMean  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.hist sampleMeans, bins=25 ; plt.axvline 5.5,c="r", linestyle="--"  plt.title "Sample mean distribution, trial: {}, sample size:  {}".format trials, sampleSize   plt.xlabel "Sample mean"  plt.ylabel "Count" ;  I used the dashed vertical line to highlight the location of the true population mean. The  visualization can be seen here:   Figure 4.8 – Sample mean distribution for 100 trials with a sample size of 4  Let's also take a note of the sample means' standard deviation:  np.mean sampleMeans   The result is 5.9575.  Now, let's repeat the process by increasing the number of trials to 4, 16, 64, and 100,  keeping sampleSize = 4 unchanged. I am going to use a subplot to do this.   100     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  The follow code snippet first declares a function that returns the sample means as a list:  def obtainSampleMeans trials = 100, sampleSize = 4 :     sampleMeans = []     candidates = [i for i in range 1,11 ]     for i in range trials :         sampleMean = np.mean [random.choice candidates  for _  in range sampleSize ]          sampleMeans.append sampleMean      return sampleMeans  The following code snippet makes use of the function we declared and plots the result of  the experiments:  random.seed 2020  figure, axes = plt.subplots 4,1,figsize= 8,16   figure.tight_layout   times = [4,16,64,100] for i in range len times  :     sampleMeans = obtainSampleMeans 100*times[i],4      axes[i].hist sampleMeans,bins=40,density= True ;     axes[i].axvline 5.5,c="r"      axes[i].set_title "Sample mean distribution, trial: {},  sample size: {}".format 100*times[i], 4  ; print "mean: {}, std: {}".format np.mean sampleMeans ,np. std sampleMeans      Understanding statistics associated with sampling      101  You may observe an interesting trend where the distributions assume an increasingly  smooth shape. Note that the skipping is due to the fact that the possible sample values are  all integers:  Figure 4.9 – Sample mean distribution with 400, 1,600, 6,400, and 10,000 trials   102     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  There are two discoveries here:     As the number of trials increases, the sample means' distribution becomes smoother      When the number of trials reaches a certain level, the standard deviation doesn't   and bell-shaped.  seem to change.   To verify the second claim, you need to compute the standard deviation of the sample  means. I will leave this to you. The result is listed here. As regards the four different  numbers of trials, the standard deviations are all around 1.44. Here is the output of the  code snippet showing no significant decrease in standard deviation:  trials: 400, mean: 5.64, std: 1.4078218992472025 trials: 1600, mean: 5.53390625, std: 1.4563112832464553 trials: 6400, mean: 5.4877734375, std: 1.4309896472527093 trials: 10000, mean: 5.51135, std: 1.4457899838842432   Next, let's study the influence of the number of trials. The following code snippet does  the trick. In order to obtain more data points for future analysis, I am going to skip some  plotting results, but you can always check the official notebook of the book for yourself. I  am going to stick to trials = 6400 for this experiment:  random.seed 2020  sizes = [2**k for k in range 1,9 ] figure, axes = plt.subplots 8,1,figsize= 8,4*8   figure.tight_layout   for i in range len sizes  :     sampleMeans = obtainSampleMeans 6400,sizes[i]      axes[i].hist sampleMeans,bins=np.linspace np. min sampleMeans ,np.max sampleMeans ,40 ,density= True ;     axes[i].axvline 5.5,c="r", linestyle="--"      axes[i].set_title "Sample mean distribution, trial: {},  sample size: {}".format 6400, sizes[i]  ;     axes[i].set_xlim 0,10  print "mean: {}, std: {}".format np.mean sampleMeans ,np. std sampleMeans      Understanding statistics associated with sampling      103  Let's check the sampleSize = 16 result:  Figure 4.10 – Sample mean distribution; sample size = 16  If the sample size increases eightfold, you obtain the following:  Figure 4.11 – Sample mean distribution; sample size = 128  We do see that the standard error of the sample mean shrinks when the sample size  increases. The estimates of the population mean are more precise, hence a tighter and  tighter histogram. We will study this topic more quantitatively in the next subsection.  Standard error of the sample mean The sample mean's standard error decreases when the sample size increases. We will do  some visualization to find out the exact relationship. The standard error is the standard  deviation of a statistic of a sampling distribution. Here, the statistic is the mean.   104     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  The thought experiment tip A useful technique for checking a monotonic relationship is to perform a  thought experiment. Imagine the sample size is 1, then, when the number of  trials increases to infinity, basically we will be calculating the statistics of the  population itself. On the other hand, if the sample size increases to a very large  number, then every sample mean will be very close to the true population  mean, which leads to small variance.  Here, I plotted the relationship between the size of the sample and the standard deviation  of the sample mean. The following code snippet does the job:  random.seed 2020  sizes = [2**k for k in range 1,9 ] ses = [] figure, axes = plt.subplots 8,1,figsize= 8,4*8   for i in range len sizes  :     sampleMeans = obtainSampleMeans 6400,sizes[i]  ses.append np.std sampleMeans    Due to space limitations, here we only show two of the eight sub-figures:  Figure 4.12 – Sample mean distribution when the sample size is 2   Understanding statistics associated with sampling      105  With a larger sample size, we have the following diagram:  Figure 4.13 – Sample mean distribution when the sample size is 256  Then we plot the relationship in a simple line chart:  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.plot sizes,ses  plt.title "Standard Error of Sample Mean Versus Sample Size"  plt.xlabel "Sample Size"  plt.ylabel "Standard Error of Sample Mean" ;  What you get is a following curve:  Figure 4.14 – The sample mean standard error decreases with the sample size   106     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  Now, let's perform a transformation of the standard error so the relationship   becomes clear:  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.plot sizes,[1 ele**2 for ele in ses]  plt.title "Inverse of the Square of Standard Error \nversus  Sample Size"  plt.xlabel "Sample Size"  plt.ylabel "Transformed Standard Error of Sample Mean" ;  The output becomes a straight linear line:  Figure 4.15 – Standard error transformation  There is a linear relationship between the sample size and the inverse of the square of the  standard error. Let's use n to denote the sample size:  σ𝑛𝑛∝ 1√𝑛𝑛    σ𝑛𝑛= σ√𝑛𝑛   Understanding statistics associated with sampling      107  Now, recall that if the sample size is 1, we are basically calculating the population itself.  Therefore, the relationship is exactly the following:  This equation is useful for estimating the true population standard deviation.   Note on replacement I used the random.choice   function for sampleSize times in this  example. This suggests that I am sampling from an infinitely large population,  or sampling with replacements. However, in the first section, when sampling  Texas population data, I used the random.sample  sampleSize   function to sample a finite dataset without replacements.  The analysis of the sample mean will still apply, but the standard error's coefficient will  be different. You will pick up a finite population correction factor that is related to the  population size. We won't go deeper into this topic due to content limitation.  The central limit theorem One last topic to discuss in this chapter is probably one of the most important theorems in  statistics. You may notice that the shape of the sample mean distribution tends to a bell- shaped distribution, indeed, a normal distribution. This is due to one of the most famous  and important theorems in statistics – the Central Limit Theorem  CLT . The CLT states that, given a sufficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the  mean for a variable will approximate a normal distribution regardless of that variable's  distribution in the population. Recall that the example distribution I used is the simplest discrete uniform distribution.  You can already see that the sample mean follows the bell-shaped distribution, which is  equivalent to checking the sample sum. The CLT is very strong. Normal distribution is  the most important distribution among many others, as we will cover in the next chapter.  Mathematicians developed a lot of theories and tools relating to normal distribution. The  CLT enables us to apply those tools to other distributions as well. Proving the CLT is beyond the scope of this introductory book. However, you are  encouraged to perform the following thought experiment and do a computational  experiment to verify it.   108     Sampling and Inferential Statistics  You toss an unfair coin that favors heads, and record the heads as 1 and tails as 0. A set  of tossings contains n tossings. If n equals 1, you can do m sets of tossing and count the  sum of each set's results. What you can get is m binary numbers, either 0 or 1, with 1 more  likely than 0. If n = 10, the sum of a set can now take values from 0 to 10 and will likely have an average  greater than 5 because the coin is unfair. However, now you have a spread of the possible  outcomes, no longer binary. As n increases, the sum of the tossing set keeps increasing,  but it will likely increase at a more stable rate, probably around 0.7? Casually speaking, the sum hides the intrinsic structure of the original distribution. To  verify this amazing phenomenon, perform some computational experiments. The code  snippets in this chapter provides useful skeletons.  Summary In this chapter, you learned important but often undervalued concepts such as population,  samples, and sampling methods. You learned the right ways to perform sampling as well  as the pitfalls of dangerous sampling methods. We also made use of several important  distributions in this chapter.  In the next chapter, you are going to systematically learn some common important  distributions. With these background concepts solidified, we can then move on to  inferential statistics with confidence.   5 Common Probability  Distributions  In the previous chapter, we discussed the concepts of population and sampling. In  most cases, it is not likely that you will find a dataset that perfectly obeys a well-defined  distribution. However, common probability distributions are the backbone of data science  and serve as the first approximation of real-world distributions.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:     Understanding important concepts in probability    Understanding common discrete probability distributions    Understanding common continuous probability distributions     Learning about joint and conditional distribution    Understanding the power law and black swan  Recall the famous saying, there is nothing more practical than good theory. The theory of  probability is beyond greatness. Let's get started!   110     Common Probability Distributions Understanding important concepts in  probability First of all, we need to clarify some fundamental concepts in probability theory.  Events and sample space The easiest and most intuitive way to understand probability is probably through the idea  of counting. When tossing a fair coin, the probability of getting a heads is one half. You  count two possible results and associate the probability of one half with each of them. And  the sum of all the associated non-overlapping events, not including having a coin standing  on its edge, must be unity. Generally, probability is associated with events within a sample space, S. In the coin  tossing example, tossing the coin is considered a random experiment; it has two possible  outcomes, and the collection of all outcomes is the sample space. The outcome of having a  heads tails is an event. Note that an event is not necessarily single-outcome, for example, tossing a dice and  defining an event as having a result larger than 4. The event contains a subset of the  six-outcome sample space. If the dice is fair, it is intuitive to say that such an event having   a result larger than 4 is associated with the probability P A  =13 .  The probability of the whole sample space is 1 and any probability lies between 0 and 1. If  an event A contains no outcomes, the probability is 0.  Such intuition doesn't only apply to discrete outcomes. For continuous cases such as the  arrival time of a bus between 8 A.M. and 9 A.M., you can define the sample space S as the  whole-time interval from 8 A.M. to 9 A.M. An event A can be a bus arriving between 8:30  and 8:40, while another event B can be a bus arriving later than 8:50. A has a probability of   𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  =16  and B has a probability of 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 =16  as well.  Let's use ∪  and ∩  to denote the union and intersection of two events. The following three     𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  > 0  for any event 𝐴𝐴 ⊆𝑆𝑆     𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆  = 1     If A, B are mutually exclusive, then 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∪𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 +𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵   relationship holds: 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∪𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 +𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 −𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵    This leaves to you to verify that if A, B are not mutually exclusive, the following   axioms for probability calculation will hold:   Understanding important concepts in probability     111  The probability mass function and the probability  density function Both the Probability Mass Function  PMF  and the Probability Density Function   PDF  we are invented to describe the point density of a distribution. PMF can be used  to describe the probability of discrete events, whereas PDF can be used to describe  continuous cases. Let's look at some examples to understand these functions better.  PMF PMF associates each single outcome of a discrete probability with a probability. For  example, the following table represents a PMF for our coin-tossing experiment:  Figure 5.1 – Probability of coin tossing outcomes  If the coin is biased toward heads, then the probability of having heads will be larger than  0.5, but the sum will remain as 1. Let's say you toss two fair dice. What is the PMF for the sum of the outcomes? We can  achieve the result by counting. The table cells contain the sum of the two outcomes:  Figure 5.2 – Sum of two dice-tossing outcomes   112     Common Probability Distributions  We can then build a PMF table as shown in the following table. As you can see, the  probability associated with each outcome is different. Also note that the sample space  changes its definition when we change the random experiment. In these two-dice cases,  the sample space S becomes all the outcomes of the possible sums:  Figure 5.3 – Probability of the sum of dice tossing  Let's denote the one dice's outcome as A and another as B. You can verify that P A.B  =  P A .P B . In this case, the easiest example is the case of that sum being 2 and 12.   Understanding important concepts in probability     113  The following code snippet can simulate the experiment as we know that each dice  generates the possible outcome equally. First, generate all the possible outcomes:  import random import numpy as np dice = [1,2,3,4,5,6] probs = [1 6,1 6,1 6,1 6,1 6,1 6] sums = sorted np.unique [dice[i] + dice[j] for i in range 6   for j in range 6 ]    The following code then calculates all the associated probabilities. I iterated every possible  pair of outcomes and added the probability product to the corresponding result. Here, we  make use of the third axiom declared earlier, and the relationship we just claimed:  from collections import OrderedDict res = OrderedDict   for s in sums:     res[s] = 0     for i in range 6 :         for j in range 6 :             if dice[i]+dice[j]==s:                 res[s] += probs[i]*probs[j]  Note on code performance The code is not optimized for performance but for readability.  OrderedDict creates a dictionary that maintains the order of the key as the order in  which the keys are created. Let's check the results and plot them with a bar plot. Since the dictionary is ordered, it is  OK to plot keys   and values   directly as x and height as per the function's API:  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.bar res.keys  ,res.values    plt.title "Probabilities of Two Dice Sum"  plt.xlabel "Sum Value"  plt.ylabel "Probability" ;   114     Common Probability Distributions  Let's check out the beautiful symmetric result:  You can check the sum of the values by using sum res.values   .  Figure 5.4 – Probabilities of two dice sums  PDF PDF is the equivalent of PMF for continuous distribution. For example, a uniform   distribution at interval [0,1] will have a PDF of 𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥 =𝑃𝑃 𝑥𝑥 =1  for any x in the range.  The requirements for a PDF to be valid are straightforward from the axioms for a valid  probability. A PDF must be non-negative and integrates to 1 in the range where it takes   a value. Let's check a simple example. Suppose the PDF of the bus' arrival time looks as follows:  Figure 5.5 – PDF of the bus arrival time   Understanding important concepts in probability     115  You may check that the shaded region does have an area of 1. The bus has the highest  probability of arriving at 8:30 and a lower probability of arriving too early or too late. This  is a terrible bus service anyway. Unlike PMF, a PDF's value can take an arbitrarily high number. The highest probability for  the two-dice outcome is   , but the highest value on the PDF graph is 2. This is one crucial  difference between PDF and PMF. A single point on the PDF function doesn't hold the  same meaning as a value in the PMF table. Only the integrated Area Under the   Curve  AUC  represents a meaningful probability. For example, in the previous PDF,   the probability that the bus will arrive between 8:24 A.M.  8.4 on the x-axis  and 8:36   A.M.  8.6 on the x-axis  is the area of the central lightly shaded part, as shown in the   following graph:   Figure 5.6 – Probability that a bus will arrive between 8:24 A.M. and 8:36 A.M.  Note on the difference between PMF PDF plots and histogram plots Don't confuse the PMF or PDF plots with the histogram plots you saw in  previous chapters. A histogram shows data distribution, whereas the PMF  and PDF are not backed by any data but theoretical claims. It is not possible  to schedule a bus that obeys the preceding weird PDF strictly, but when we  estimate the mean arrival time of the bus, the PDF can be used as a simple  approachable tool.  Integrating a PDF up to a certain value x gives you the Cumulative Distribution   𝑥𝑥 Function  CDF , which is shown as the following formula: 𝐹𝐹𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥 =∫ 𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥  −∞  values between 0 and 1. A CDF contains all the information a PDF contains. Sometimes it  is easier to use a CDF instead of a PDF in order to solve certain problems.  .  It takes    116     Common Probability Distributions Subjective probability and empirical probability From another perspective, you can classify probabilities into two types:      Subjective probability, or theoretical probability     Empirical probability, or objective probability  Let's look at each of these classifications in detail. Subjective probability stems from a theoretical argument without any observation of the  data. You check the coin and think it is a fair one, and then you come up with an equal  probability of heads and tails. You don't require any observations or random experiments.  All you have is a priori knowledge.  On the other hand, empirical probability is deduced from observations or experiments.  For example, you observed the performance of an NBA player and estimated his  probability of 3-point success for next season. Your conclusion comes from a   posteriori knowledge.  If theoretical probability exists, by the law of large numbers, given sufficient observations,  the observed frequency will approximate the theoretical probability infinitely closely. For  the content of this book, we won't go into details of the proof, but the intuition is clear. In a real-world project, you may wish to build a robust model to obtain a subjective  probability. Then, during the process of observing random experiment results, you adjust  the probability to reflect the observed correction.   Understanding common discrete probability  distributions In this section, we will introduce you to some of the most important and common  distributions. I will first demonstrate some examples and the mechanism behind them  that exhibits corresponding probability. Then I will calculate the expectation and variance  of the distribution, show you samples that generated from the probability, and plot its  histogram plot and boxplot.  The expectation of X that follows a distribution is the mean value that X can take. For   example, with PDF 𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥 , the mean is calculated as follows: 𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥 =∫ 𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥  ∞ −∞      Understanding common discrete probability distributions     117  The variance measures the spreading behavior of the distribution and is calculated   as follows:  𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑥𝑥 =∫ 𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥  𝑥𝑥−𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥  2𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥  ∞ −∞     μ and σ2 are the common symbols for expectation and variance. X is called a random variable. Note that it is the outcome of a random experiment.  However, not all random variables represent outcomes of events. For example, you  can take Y = exp X , and Y is also a random variable, but not an outcome of a random  experiment. You can calculate the expectation and variance of any random variable.  We have three discrete distributions to cover. They are as follows:     Bernoulli distribution    Binomial distribution    Poisson distribution  Now, let's look at these in detail one by one.  Bernoulli distribution Bernoulli distribution is the simplest discrete distribution that originates from a Bernoulli  experiment. A Bernoulli experiment resembles a general coin-tossing scenario. The name  comes from Jakob I. Bernoulli, a famous mathematician in the 1600s.  A Bernoulli experiment has two outcomes, and the answer is usually binary that one  outcome excludes another. For example, the following are all valid Bernoulli experiments:     Randomly ask a person whether they are married.    Buy a lottery ticket to win the lottery.    Whether a person will vote for Trump in 2020.  If one event is denoted as a success with probability p, then the opposite is denoted as a  failure with probability 1 - p.  Using X to denote the outcome and x to denote the outcome's realization, where we set   x = 1 to be a success and x = 0 to be a failure, the PMF can be concisely written as follows:  𝑓𝑓𝑋𝑋 𝑥𝑥 =𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 1−𝑝𝑝  1−𝑥𝑥     118     Common Probability Distributions  Note on notations As you may have already noticed, the uppercase letter is used to denote the  outcome or event itself, whereas the lowercase letter represents a specific  realization of the outcome. For example, x can represent the realization that X  takes the value of married in one experiment. X denotes the event itself.  Given the definitions, the mean is as follows:  The variance is as follows:  𝑝𝑝∗1 +  1−𝑝𝑝  ∗ 0 = 𝑝𝑝    0−𝑝𝑝 2 1−𝑝𝑝 + 1−𝑝𝑝 2𝑝𝑝=𝑝𝑝 1−𝑝𝑝    The following code performs a computational experiment with p = 0.7 and sample  size = 1000:  p = 0.7 samples = [random.random   < 0.7 for _ in range 1000 ] print np.mean samples ,np.var samples    Since the result is straightforward, we won't get into it. You are welcome to examine it.  Binomial distribution Binomial distribution is built upon the Bernoulli distribution. Its outcome is the sum of a  collection of independent Bernoulli experiments.  Note on the concept of independency This is the first time that we have used the word independent explicitly. In  a two-coin experiment, it is easy to imagine the fact that tossing one coin  won't influence the result of another in any way. It is enough to understand  independent this way and we will go into its mathematical details later.  Let's say you do n Bernoulli experiments, each with a probability of success p. Then we  say the outcome X follows a binomial distribution parametrized by n and p. The outcome  of the experiment can take any value k as long as k is smaller than or equal to n. The PMF  reads as follows:  𝑓𝑓 𝑘𝑘,𝑛𝑛,𝑝𝑝 =𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑘𝑘 =  𝑛𝑛! 𝑘𝑘! 𝑛𝑛−𝑘𝑘 !𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘 1−𝑝𝑝 𝑛𝑛−𝑘𝑘    Understanding common discrete probability distributions     119  The first term represents the combination of selecting k successful experiments out of n.  The second term is merely a product of independent Bernoulli distribution PMF. The expectation mean of the binomial distribution is np and the variance is np 1 – p . This  fact follows the results of the sums of independent random variables. The mean is the sum  of means and the variance is the sum of the variance. Let's do a simple computational example, tossing a biased coin with P Head  = 0.8 100  times and plotting the distribution of the sum with 1,000 trials. The following code  snippet first generates the theoretical data points:  X = [i for i in range 1,101 ] p = 0.8 Fx = [np.math.factorial n   np.math.factorial n-k *np.math. factorial k  *p**k* 1-p ** n-k  for k in X]  Then the following code snippet conducts the experiment and the plotting:  random.seed 2020  n = 100 K = [] for trial in range 1000 :     k = np.sum [random.random   < p for _ in range n ]      K.append k  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   plt.hist K,bins=30,density=True,label="Computational Experiment  PMF" ; plt.plot X,Fx,color="r",label="Theoretical PMF",linestyle="--"  plt.legend  ;   120     Common Probability Distributions  The result looks as follows:  Figure 5.7 – Binomial distribution, theoretical, and simulation results  The simulated values and the theoretical values agree pretty well. Now, we'll move on to  another important distribution.  Poisson distribution The last discrete distribution we will cover is Poisson distribution. It has a PMF as shown  in the following equation, where λ is a parameter:  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑘𝑘 =𝑒𝑒−λλ𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘!     k can take values of positive integers. This distribution looks rather odd, but it appears in  nature everywhere. Poisson distribution can describe the times a random event happens  during a unit of time. For example, the number of people calling 911 in the United States  every minute will obey a Poisson distribution. The count of gene mutations per unit of  time also follows a Poisson distribution. Let's first examine the influence of the value λ.  The following code snippet plots the theoretical PMF for different values of λ:  lambdas = [2,4,6,16] K = [k for k in range 30 ] plt.figure figsize= 8,6   for i,l in enumerate lambdas :     plt.plot K,[np.exp -l *l**k np.math.factorial k  for k in  K],              label=str l ,   Understanding the common continuous probability distribution      121              marker=i*2  plt.legend   plt.ylabel "Probability"  plt.xlabel "Values"  plt.title "Parameterized Poisson Distributions" ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 5.8 – Poisson distribution with various λ values  The trend is that the larger λ is, the larger the mean and variance will become. This  observation is true. Indeed, the mean and variance of Poisson distribution are both λ. The numpy.random.poisson   function can easily generate Poisson distribution  samples. The computational experiment is left to you. You can try and conduct  computational experiments on your own for further practice.  Understanding the common continuous  probability distribution  In this section, you will see the three most important continuous distributions:     Uniform distribution    Exponential distribution    Gaussian normal distribution Let's look at each of these in detail.   122     Common Probability Distributions Uniform distribution Uniform distribution is an important uniform distribution. It is useful computationally  because many other distributions can be simulated with uniform distribution. In  earlier code examples, I used random.random   in the simulation of the Bernoulli  distribution, which itself generates a uniform random variable in the range [0,1]. For a uniformly distributed random variable on [0,1], the mean is 0.5 and the variance is   112 . This is a good number to remember for a data scientist role interview. For a general uniform distribution, If the range is [a,b], the PDF reads as 𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑥𝑥 = 1𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎   if x is in the range [a,b]. The mean and variance become  +2   and   −  2 12   , respectively.  If you remember calculus, check it yourself. We will skip the computational experiments  part for simplicity and move on to exponential distribution.  Exponential distribution The exponential distribution function is another important continuous distribution  function. In nature, it mostly describes the time difference between independent random  distribution. For example, the time between two episodes of lightning in a thunderstorm  or the time between two 911 calls. Recall that the number of 911 calls in a unit of time  follows the Poisson distribution. Exponential distribution and Poisson distribution do  have similarities. The PDF for exponential distribution is also parameterized by λ. The value x can only take  non-negative values. Its PDF observes the following form:  Because of the monotonicity of the PDF, the maximal value always happens at x = 0,  where f 0,λ  = λ. The following code snippet plots the PDF for different λ:  𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥,λ =λ𝑒𝑒−λ𝑥𝑥   lambdas = [0.2,0.4,0.8,1.0] K = [0.5*k for k in range 15 ] plt.figure figsize= 8,6   for i,l in enumerate lambdas :     plt.plot K,[np.exp -l*k *l for k in K],              label=str l ,             marker=i*2  plt.legend   plt.ylabel "Probability"    Understanding the common continuous probability distribution      123  plt.xlabel "Values"  plt.title "Parameterized Exponential Distributions" ;   The result looks as follows:  Figure 5.9 – Exponential distribution with various λ  The larger λ is, the higher the peak at 0 is, but the faster the distribution decays. A smaller  λ gives a lower peak, but a fatter tail. Integrating the product of x and PDF gives us the expectation and variance. First the  expectation reads as follows:  The variance reads as follows:  ∞ 0  =1λ  𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥 =∫ 𝑥𝑥λ𝑒𝑒−λxdx ∞ 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑥𝑥 =∫  𝑥𝑥−𝐸𝐸 𝑥𝑥  2λ𝑒𝑒−λxdx 0  =1λ2   The result agrees with the graphical story. The larger λ is, the thinner the tail is, and hence  the smaller the expectation is. Meanwhile, the peakier shape brings down the variance. Next, we will investigate normal distribution.   124     Common Probability Distributions Normal distribution We have used the term normal distribution quite often in previous chapters without  defining it precisely.  A one-dimensional normal distribution has a PDF as follows. μ and σ2 are the parameters  as expectation and standard deviation:  A standard normal function has an expectation of 0 and a variance of 1. Therefore, its PDF  reads as follows in a simpler form:  𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥 = 1𝜎𝜎√2𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒− 𝑥𝑥−𝜇𝜇 2 2𝜎𝜎2   𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥 = 1√2π𝑒𝑒−𝑥𝑥22    Qualitative argument of a normal distribution PDF The standard normal distribution PDF is an even function, so it is symmetric  with a symmetric axis x = 0. Its PDF also monotonically decays from its peak  at a faster rate than the exponential distribution PDF because it has a squared  form.  Transforming the standard PDF to a general PDF, the expectation μ  on the exponent   shifts the position of the symmetric axis and the variance σ2 determines how quick the  decay is. The universality of normal distribution is phenomenal. For example, the human  population's height and weight roughly follow a normal distribution. The number of  leaves on trees in a forest will also roughly follow a normal distribution. From the CLT, we  know that the sample sum from a population of any distribution will ultimately tend to  follow a normal distribution.  Take the tree leaves example, and imagine that the probability of growing a leaf follows a  very sophisticated probability. The total number of leaves on a tree will, however, cloud  the details of the sophistication of the probability, but gives you a normal distribution. A  lot of phenomena in nature follow a similar pattern: what we observe is a collection or  summation of lower-level mechanisms. This is how the CLT makes normal distribution so  universal and important. For now, let's focus on a one-dimensional one.   Understanding the common continuous probability distribution      125  Let's plot several normal distribution PDFs with different expectations, [ -1, 0 and  1], with the following code snippet:  mus = [-1,0,1] K = [0.2*k-5 for k in range 50 ] plt.figure figsize= 8,6   for i,mu in enumerate mus :     plt.plot K, [1  np.sqrt 2*np.pi  *np.exp - k-mu **2 2  for  k in K],              label=str mu ,             marker=i*2  plt.legend   plt.ylabel „Probability"  plt.xlabel „Values"  plt.title „Parameterized Normal Distributions" ;   The result looks as follows:   Figure 5.10 – Normal distribution with different expectations  I will leave the exercise with a different variance to you.  Normal distribution has a deep connection with various statistical tests. We will cover the  details in Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing.   126     Common Probability Distributions Learning about joint and conditional  distribution We have covered basic examples from discrete probability distributions and continuous  probability distributions. Note that all of them describe the distribution of a single  experiment outcome. How about the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of two  events outcomes? The proper mathematical language is joint distribution. Suppose random variables X and Y denote the height and weight of a person. The  following probability records the probability that X = x and Y = y simultaneously, which  is called a joint distribution. A joint distribution is usually represented as shown in the  following equation:  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑥𝑥,𝑌𝑌=𝑦𝑦    For a population, we may have P X = 170cm, Y = 75kg  = 0.25. You may ask the question:  What is the probability of a person being 170 cm while weighing 75 kg? So, you see that  there is a condition that we already know this person weighs 75 kg. The expression for a  conditional distribution is a ratio as follows:  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=170𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑌𝑌=75𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 =𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=170𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐,𝑌𝑌=75𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘  𝑃𝑃 𝑌𝑌=75𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘      The notation P XY  represents the conditional distribution of X given Y. Conditional  distributions are everywhere, and people often misread them by ignoring the conditions.  For example, does the following argument make sense?   Most people have accidents within 5 miles of their home, therefore, the   further away you drive, the safer you are.  What's wrong with this claim? It claims the probability P death  more than 5 miles away   to be small as compared to P death  less than 5 miles away  given the fact that P death   less than 5 miles away  is larger than P death  more than 5 miles away . It intentionally  ignores the fact that the majority of commutes take place within short distances of the  home in its phrasing of the claim. The denominator is simply too small on the right-hand  side in the following equation:  P death  more than 5 miles away  = 𝑃𝑃 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑ℎ,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎 5 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚 𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎  𝑃𝑃 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑 𝑑𝑑ℎ𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎 5 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚 𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑎𝑎   I hope you are able to spot such tricks and understand the essence of these concepts.      Understanding the power law and black swan     127  Independency and conditional distribution Now, we can explore the true meaning of independency. In short, there are two equivalent  ways to declare two random variables independent. P X = x, Y = y  = P X = x P Y =  y  for any x,y and P X = xY = y  = P X = x  for any x,y. You can check that they are  indeed equivalent. We see an independent relationship between X and Y implies that  a conditional distribution of a random variable X over Y doesn't really depend on the  random variable Y.  If you can decompose the PDF PMF of a joint probability into a product of two PDFs  PMFs that one only contains one random variable and another only contains another  random variable, then the two random variables are independent. Let's look at a quick example. You toss a coin three times. X denotes the event when you  see two or more heads and Y denotes the event when the sum of heads is odd. Are X and  Y independent? Let's do a quick calculation to obtain the probabilities:  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 =12   ,  𝑃𝑃 𝑌𝑌=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 =12   ,  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇,𝑌𝑌=𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 =14   You can verify the remaining three cases to check that X and Y are indeed independent.  The idea of conditional distribution is key to understanding many behaviors: for example,  the survival bias. For all the planes returning from the battlefield, if the commander  reinforces those parts where the plane got shot, will the air force benefit from it? The  answer is probably no. The commander is not looking at the whole probability, but a  conditional probability distribution based on the fact the plane did return. To make the  correct judgement, the commander should reinforce those parts where the plane was not  shot. It is likely that a plane that got shot in those areas didn't make it back. Conditional probability is also crucial to understanding the classical classification  algorithm: the Bayes-based classifier. Adding an independence requirement to the features  of the data, we simplify the algorithm further to the naïve Bayes classifier. We will cover  these topics in Chapter 9, Working with Statistics for Classification Tasks.  .   Understanding the power law and black swan In this last section, I want to give you a brief overview of the so-called power law and  black swan events.    128     Common Probability Distributions The ubiquitous power law What is the power law? If you have two quantities such that one varies according to  a power relationship of another, and independent of the initial sizes, then you have a  power law relationship. Many distributions have a power law shape, rather than normal   distributions: 𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑥𝑥 =𝐶𝐶𝑥𝑥−α . The exponential distribution we saw previously is one   such example. For a real-word example, the frequency of words in most languages follows a power  law. The English letter frequencies also roughly follow a power law. e appears the most  often, with a frequency of 11%. The following graph taken from Wikipedia  https:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Letter_frequency  shows a typical example of such   a power law:  Figure 5.11 – Frequency of English letters   Understanding the power law and black swan     129  What's amazing about a power law is not only its universality, but also its lack of   well-defined mean and variance in some cases. For example, when α is larger than 2,   the expectation of such a power law distribution will explode to infinity, while when α   is larger than 3, the variance will also explode.   Be aware of the black swan Simply put, a lack of well-defined variance implications is known as black swan behavior.  A black swan event is a rare event that is hard to predict or compute scientifically.  However, black swan events have a huge impact on history, science, or finance, and   make people rationalize black swan events in hindsight.  Note Before people found black swans in Australia, Europeans believed that all  swans were white. The term black swan was coined to represent ideas that were  considered impossible.  Here are some of the typical examples of black swan events:     The 2020 coronavirus outbreak    The 2008 financial crisis    The assassination of Franz Ferdinand, which sparked World War I  People can justify those events afterward, which make black swans totally inescapable, but  no one was prepared to prevent the occurrence of those black swans beforehand.  Beware of black swan events in the distribution you are working on. Remember, in the  case of our Texas county population data in Chapter 4, Sampling and Inference Statistics,  that most of the counties have small populations, but quite a few have populations that are  10 times above the average. If you have sampled your data on a fair number of occasions  and didn't see these outliers, you may be inclined toward making incorrect estimations.   130     Common Probability Distributions Summary In this chapter, we covered the basics of common discrete and continuous probability  distributions, examined their statistics, and also visualized the PDFs. We also talked about  joint distribution, conditional distribution, and independency. We also briefly covered  power law and black swan behavior. Many distributions contain parameters that dictate the behavior of the probability  distribution. Suppose we know a sample comes from a population that follows a certain  distribution; how do you find the parameter of the distribution? This will be the topic of  our next chapter: parametric estimation.   6 Parametric  Estimation  One big challenge when working with probability distributions is identifying the  parameters in the distributions. For example, the exponential distribution has a parameter  λ, and you can estimate it to get an idea of the mean and the variance of the distribution. Parametric estimation is the process of estimating the underlying parameters that govern  the distribution of a dataset. Parameters are not limited to those that define the shape of  the distribution, but also the locations. For example, if you know that a dataset comes  from a uniform distribution but you don't know the lower bound, a, and upper bound, b,  of the distribution, you can also estimate the values of a and b as they are also considered  legitimate parameters. Parametric estimation is important because it gives you a good idea of the dataset with a  handful of parameters, for example, the distributions and associated descriptive statistics.  Although real-life examples won't exactly follow a distribution, parameter estimation   does serve as a benchmark for building more complicated models to model the   underlying distribution.    132     Parametric Estimation  After finishing this chapter, you will be able to complete the following   tasks independently:     Understanding the concepts of parameter estimation and the features of estimators    Using the method of moments to estimate parameters    Applying the maximum likelihood approach to estimate parameters with Python  Understanding the concepts of parameter  estimation and the features of estimators A introduction to estimation theory requires a good mathematical understanding and  careful derivation. Here, I am going to use layman's terms to give you a brief but adequate  introduction so that we can move on to concrete examples quickly. Estimation, in statistics, refers to the process of estimating unknown values from  empirical data that involves random components. Sometimes, people confuse estimation  with prediction. Estimation usually deals with hidden parameters that are embodied in a  known dataset: things that already happened, while prediction tries to predict values that  are explicitly not in the dataset: things that haven't happened. For example, estimating  the population of the world 1,000 years ago is an estimation problem. You can use  various kinds of data that may contain information about the population. The population  is a number that will not change but is unknown. On the other hand, predicting the  population in the year 2050 is a prediction problem because the number is essentially  unknown, and we have no data that contains it explicitly.  What parameters can we estimate? In principle, you can estimate any parameter as long  as it is involved in the creation or generation of the random datasets. Let's use the symbol  θ as the set of all unknown parameters and x as the set of data. For example, θ1 and x1 will  represent one of the parameters and a single data point, respectively, here indexed by 1. If  p xθ  depends on θ, 'we can estimate that θ exists in the dataset .  A note on the exchangeable use of terms Estimation and prediction can sometimes be exchangeable. Often, estimation  doesn't assert the values of new data, while prediction does, but ambiguity  always exists.   For example, if you want to know the trajectory of a missile given its current position, the  old positions are indeed unknown data, but they can also be treated as hidden parameters  that will determine the positions observed later. We will not go down this rabbit hole here.  You are good to go if you understand what's going on.   Understanding the concepts of parameter estimation and the features of estimators     133  An estimator is required to obtain the estimated values of the parameters that we're  interested in. An estimator is also static, and the underlined parameter is called the  estimand. A particular value that an estimator takes is called an estimate  a noun . Too many concepts? Let's look at a real-world case. Let's take the 2016 US general election  as an example. The voting rate is an estimand because it is a parameter to model voting  behavior. A valid, straightforward strategy is to take the average voting rates of a sample of  counties in the US regardless of their population and other demographic characteristics.  This strategy can be treated as an estimator. Let's say that a set of sampled counties gives a  value of 0.34, which means 34% of the population vote. Then, the value 0.34 is an estimate,  as the realization of our naive estimator. Take another sample of counties; the same  estimator may give the value of 0.4 as another estimate.  Note: the estimator can be simple The estimator is not necessarily complicated or fancy. It is just a way of  determining unknown parameters. You can claim the unknown parameter  to be a constant regardless of whatever you observe. A constant is a valid  estimator, but it is a horribly wrong one. For the same estimand, you can have  as many estimators as you want. To determine which one is better, we require  more quantitative analysis.  Without further specifications, estimators in this chapter refer to the point estimator. The  point estimator offers the single best guess of the parameter, while the so-called interval  estimator gives an interval of the best guesses. In the next section, let's review the criteria for evaluating estimators.  Evaluation of estimators For the same estimand, how do we evaluate the qualities of different estimators?  Think of the election example; we want the estimation to be as accurate as possible, as  robust as possible, and so on. The properties of being accurate and robust have specific  mathematical definitions and they are crucial for picking the right estimator for the   right tasks. The following is a list of the criteria:     Biasness    Consistency    Efficiency   134     Parametric Estimation  Let's look at each of these criteria in detail.  The first criterion – biasness Recall that an estimator is also a random variable that will take different values depending   on the observed sample from the population. Let's use θ̂  to denote the estimator and θ to  The expected value of the difference between θ̂  and θ is said to be the bias of the estimator,   denote the true value of the parameter  variable , which our estimator tries to estimate.   which can be formulated as follows:  Bias  θ̂  = E θ̂ - θ    Note that the expectation is calculated over the distribution P xθ , as varied θ is supposed  to change the sampled sets of x. An estimator is said to be unbiased if its bias is 0 for all values of parameter θ. Often, we  prefer an unbiased estimator over a biased estimator. For example, political analysts want  an accurate voting rate, and marketing analysts want a precise customer satisfaction rate  for strategy development. If the bias is a constant, we can subtract that constant to obtain  an unbiased estimator; if the bias depends on θ, it is not easy to fix in general. For example, the sample mean from a set using simple random sampling is an unbiased  estimator. This is rather intuitive because simple random sampling gives equal  opportunity for every member of the set to be selected.  Next, let's move on to the second criterion, which is consistency or   asymptotical consistency.    the following formula:  The second criterion – consistency As the number of data points increases indefinitely, the resulting sequence of the estimates  converges to the true value θ in probability. This is called consistency.   Let's say θn is the estimate given n data points, then for any case of ϵ>0, consistency gives  way: no matter how small you choose the infinitesimal threshold  ϵ , you can also choose   a number of data points  n  large enough such that the probability that θn is different from  θ is going to be 0. On the other hand, an inconsistent estimator will fail to estimate the  parameter unbiasedly, no matter how much data you use.  lim𝑛𝑛→∞𝑃𝑃 θ𝑛𝑛−θ>ϵ =0   For those of you who are not familiar with the language of calculus, think about it this    Understanding the concepts of parameter estimation and the features of estimators     135  Note on convergence There are two main types of convergence when we talk about probability and  distribution. One is called convergence in probability and another is called  convergence in distribution. There are differences if you plan to dig deeper into  the mathematical definitions and implications of the two kinds of convergence.  All you need to know now is that the convergence in the context of consistency  is convergence in probability.  The third criterion – efficiency The last criterion I want to introduce is relative. If two estimators are both unbiased,  which one should we choose? The most commonly used quantity is called Mean Squared  Error  MSE . MSE measures the expected value of the square of the difference between  the estimator and the true value of the parameter. The formal definition reads as follows:  𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 θ̂ =𝑀𝑀  θ̂ 𝑋𝑋 −θ 2    Note that the MSE says nothing about the biasness of the estimator. Let's say estimators  A and B both have an MSE of 10. It is possible that estimator A is unbiased, but the  estimates are scattered around the true value of θ, while estimator B is highly biased but  concentrated around a point away from the bull's eye.  What we seek is an unbiased estimator with minimal MSE. This is usually hard to achieve.  However, take a step back; among the unbiased estimators, there often exists one estimator  with the least MSE. This estimator is called the Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator   MVUE . Here, we will touch on the concept of variance-bias trade-off. The MSE contains  two parts: the bias part and the variance part. If the bias part is 0, therefore unbiased,  then the MSE only contains the variance part. So, we call this estimator the MVUE. We  will cover the concepts of bias and variance again in the sense of machine learning, for  example, in Chapter 8, Statistics for Regression, and Chapter 9, Statistics for Classification. If an estimator has a smaller MSE than another estimator, we say the first estimator is  more efficient. Efficiency is a relative concept and it is defined in terms of a measuring  metric. Here, we use MSE as the measuring metric: the smaller the MSE is, the more  efficient the estimator will be.   136     Parametric Estimation  The concept of estimators beyond statistics If you extend the concept of estimators beyond the statistical concept to a real- life methodology, the accessibility of data is vitally important. An estimator  may have all the advantages but the difficulty of obtaining data becomes a  concern. For example, to estimate the temperature of the sun's surface, it is  definitively a great idea to send a proxy to do it, but this is probably not a  cost-efficient nor time-efficient way. Scientists have used other measurements  that can be done on Earth to do the estimation. Some business scenarios  share a similar characteristic where unbiasedness is not a big issue, but data  accessibility is.  In the next two sections, I will introduce the two most important methods of   parameter estimation.  Using the method of moments to estimate  parameters The method of moments associates moments with the estimand. What is a moment? A moment is a special statistic of a distribution. The most commonly used moment is the  nth moment of a real-valued continuous function. Let's use M to denote the moment, and  it is defined as follows, where the order of the moment is reflected as the value of   the exponent:  ∞ 𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛=∫  𝑥𝑥−𝑐𝑐 𝑛𝑛 𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥  −∞ 𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛=∫ 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥 −∞  ∞     This is said to be the moment about the value c. Often, we set c to be 0:  Some results are immediately available – for example, because the integration of a valid  Probability Density Function  PDF  always gives 1. Therefore, we have M0 = 1. Also, M1 is the expectation value, therefore the mean.  A note on central moments For high-order moments where c is often set to be the mean, these moments  are called central moments. In this setting, the second moment, M2, becomes  the variance.    Using the method of moments to estimate parameters     137  Let's understand how these moments are used to estimate parameters. Let's say you have  a set of unknown parameters  θK , where K is an integer and θ is our general notation of  the unknown parameter defined earlier in this chapter. For example, to estimate a Poisson  distribution, which we introduced in Chapter 5, Common Probability Distributions, you  have K = 1 because you have one parameter to estimate.  You then follow these steps to obtain an estimate:  1.  Express the ith moment in terms of θ:  𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖=𝐸𝐸 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 =ℎ𝑖𝑖 θ1,…,θ𝐾𝐾  cid:3   This is always possible because theoretically, the parameters determine the  distribution. Take M0 and M1, for example. They have a constant of 1 and the mean  of the distribution, respectively.  2.  Calculate the moments using the observed data. After that, you obtain K equations   with K unknown parameters.  3.  Solve the K equations to obtain the unknowns.  The method of moments has several advantages, some of which are listed as follows:     The method of moments is easy and quick. The preceding process is guaranteed to   work and is usually not computationally expensive.      The estimator obtained by the method of moments is usually consistent.  However, the estimator is often biased given the limited amount of data, or even yields  unrealistic parameters outside of the parameter space.   You will gain an intuitive understanding through the following two examples.  Example 1 – the number of 911 phone calls in a day The number 911 is the emergency number for everyone in the United States. Let's assume  that the number of 911 calls is independent in a fictious city and we have all the data for  911 calls made in this virtual city every day in a year. Let's also assume that the calling  chance for each citizen is the same and unchanged across a year. We know such a discrete  distribution, although highly simplified, will follow a Poisson distribution.  Recall that the Poisson distribution takes non-negative integers and has the parameter λ.   The Probability Mass Function  PMF  reads λ𝑘𝑘𝑒𝑒−λ𝑘𝑘!   .   138     Parametric Estimation  Let's first generate a set of artificial data using the following code snippet. The true  parameter is 20. We will plot the histogram too:  np.random.seed 2020  calls = np.random.poisson lam=20, size=365  plt.hist calls, bins=20 ;  The result looks as follows:     Figure 6.1 – Histogram plot of the artificial Poisson distribution data  Now, let's express the first moment with the unknown parameter. In Chapter 5, Common  Probability Distributions, we saw that the expectation value is just λ itself. Next, let's express the first moment with the data, which is just the mean of the data. The  np.mean calls  function call gives the value 19.989. This is our estimation and it is  very close to the real parameter, 20. In short, the logic is the following:     The np.mean calls  function call gives the sample mean and we use it to   estimate the population mean.     The population mean is represented by moments. Here, it is just the first moment.    For a well-defined distribution, the population mean is an expression of    unknown parameters.  In this example, the population mean happens to have a very simple expression: the  unknown parameter λ itself. But make sure that you understand the whole chain of logic.  A more sophisticated example is given next.   Using the method of moments to estimate parameters     139  Example 2 – the bounds of uniform distribution Let's see another example of continuous distribution. We have a set of points that we assume comes from a uniform distribution. However, we  don't know the lower bound, α, and upper bound, β. We would love to estimate them. The  assumed distribution has a uniform PDF on the legitimate domain. Here is the complete  form of the distribution:  The following code snippet generates artificial data with a true parameter of 0 and 10:  np.random.seed 2020  data = np.random.uniform 0,10,2000   Let's take a look at its distribution. It clearly shows that the 2,000 randomly generated data  points are quite uniform. Each bin contains roughly the same amount of data points:  𝑃𝑃 𝑋𝑋=𝑥𝑥 = 1β−α   Figure 6.2 – Histogram plot of artificial uniform distribution data  Next, we perform the representation of moments with the unknown parameters:  1.  First, let's express the first and second moments with the parameters. The first   moment is easy as it is the average of α and β:   𝑀𝑀1=0.5 α+β     140     Parametric Estimation  The second moment requires some calculation. It is the integration of the product of  x2 and the PDF according to the definition of moments:  𝑀𝑀2=∫ 𝑥𝑥2β−α𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥 β α  =13 α2+αβ+β2    2.  Then, we calculate M1 and M2 from the data by using the following code snippet: M1 = np.mean data  M2 = np.mean data**2   3.  The next step is to express the parameters with the moments. After solving the two   equations that represent M1 and M2, we obtain the following:  α=𝑀𝑀1−√3 𝑀𝑀2–𝑀𝑀12   β=2𝑀𝑀1−α   Substituting the values of the moments, we obtain that α = -0.096 and β = 10.0011. This is  a pretty good estimation since the generation of the random variables has a lower bound  of 0 and an upper bound of 10. Wait a second! What will happen if we are unlucky and the data is highly skewed? We may  have an unreasonable estimation.  Here is an exercise. You can try to substitute the generated dataset with 1,999 values being  10 and only 1 value being 0. Now, the data is unreasonably unlikely because it is supposed  to contain 2,000 data points randomly, uniformly selected from the range 0 to 10. Do  the analysis again and you will find that α is unrealistically wrong such that a uniform  distribution starting from α cannot generate the dataset we coined itself! How ridiculous!  However, if you observe 1,999 out of 2,000 values aggregated at one single data point, will  you still assume the underlying distribution to be uniform? Probably not. This is a good  example of why the naked eye should be the first safeguard of your statistical analysis. You have estimated two sets of parameters in two different problems using the method of  moments. Next, we will move on to the maximum likelihood approach.   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     141  Applying the maximum likelihood approach  with Python Maximum Likelihood Estimation  MLE  is the most widely used estimation method. It  estimates the probability parameters by maximizing a likelihood function. The obtained  extremum estimator is called the maximum likelihood estimator. The MLE approach is  both intuitive and flexible. It has the following advantages:     MLE is consistent. This is guaranteed. In many practices, a good MLE means the job   that is left is simply to collect more data.     MLE is functionally invariant. The likelihood function can take various   transformations before maximizing the functional form. We will see examples in the  next section.     MLE is efficient. Efficiency means when the sample size tends to infinity, no other   consistent estimator has a lower asymptotic MSE than MLE.  With that power in MLE, I bet you just can't wait to try it. Before maximizing the  likelihood, we need to define the likelihood function first.  Likelihood function A likelihood function is a conditional probability distribution function that conditions  upon the hidden parameter. As the name suggests, it measures how likely it is that our  observation comes from a distribution with the hidden parameters by assuming the  hidden parameters are essentially true. When you change the hidden parameters, the  likelihood function changes value. In another words, the likelihood function is a function  of hidden parameters. The difference between a conditional distribution function and a likelihood function is  that we focus on different variables. For a conditional distribution, P event  parameter ,  we focus on the event and predict how likely it is that an event will happen. So, we are  interested in the f event  = P event  parameter = λ  function, where λ is known. We treat the likelihood function as a function over the parameter domain where all  the events are already observed – f parameter  = P event = E  parameter , where the  collection of events E is known. You can think of it as the opposite of the standard  conditional distribution defined in the preceding paragraph. Let's take coin flipping as an example. Suppose we have a coin, but we are not sure  whether it is fair or not. However, what we know is that if it is unfair, getting heads is more  likely with a probability of P head  = 0.6.    142     Parametric Estimation  Now, you toss it 20 times and get 11 heads. Is it more likely to be a fair coin or an   unfair coin? What we want to find is which of the following is more likely to be true: P 11 out of 20 is  head  fair  or P 11 out of 20 is head  unfair . Let's calculate the two possibilities. The distribution we are interested in is a binomial  distribution.   If the coin is fair, then we have the following likelihood function value:     20!11!9! 12 20≈0.1602  20!11!9! 35 11 25 9=0.1597   If the coin is biased toward heads, then the likelihood function reads as follows:  It is more likely that the coin is fair. I deliberately picked such a number so that the  difference is subtle. The essence of MLE is to maximize the likelihood function with respect  to the unknown parameter.  A note on the fact that likelihood functions don't sum to 1 You may observe a fact that likelihood functions, even enumerating all possible  cases – here, two – do not necessarily sum to unity. This is due to the fact that  likelihood functions are essentially not legitimate PDFs.  The likelihood function is a function of fairness, where the probability of getting heads  can take any value between 0 and 1. What gives a maximal value? Let's do an analytical  calculation and then plot it. Let's use p to denote the probability of getting heads and L p   to denote the likelihood function. You can do a thought experiment here. The value of p  changes from 0 to 1, but both p = 0 and p = 1 make the expression equal to 0. Somewhere  in between, there is a p value that maximizes the expression. Let's find it:  Note that the value of p that gives the maximum of this function doesn't depend on the  combinatorial factor. We can, therefore, remove it to have the following expression:  𝐿𝐿 𝑝𝑝 = 20!11!9!𝑝𝑝11 1−𝑝𝑝 9  𝐿𝐿 𝑝𝑝 =𝑝𝑝11 1−𝑝𝑝 9    Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     143  You can further take the logarithm of the likelihood function to obtain the famous  log-likelihood function:  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝 =11𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑝 +9𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 1−𝑝𝑝   𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏 =𝑏𝑏∗𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑎𝑎   and 𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 𝑎𝑎∗𝑏𝑏 =𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 𝑎𝑎 +𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑔𝑔 𝑏𝑏  .  The format is much cleaner now. In order to obtain this expression, we used the formulas   Transformation invariance The transformation suggests that the likelihood function is not fixed nor  unique. You can remove the global constant or transform it with a monotonic  function such as logarithm to fit your needs.  The next step is to obtain the maximal of the log-likelihood function. The derivative of   log x  is just 1𝑥𝑥 , so the result is simple to obtain by setting the derivative to 0. You can verify   that the function only has one extremum by yourself:  =11𝑝𝑝− 91−𝑝𝑝=0  among 20 experiments. The most likely guess is just 1120.   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑔𝑔𝐿𝐿 𝑝𝑝  𝑑𝑑𝑝𝑝  For completeness, I will plot the original likelihood distribution before moving to more  complex examples. The following code snippet demonstrates this point:  P = 0.55 is the right answer. This agrees with our intuition since we observe 11 heads   plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.plot P, factor*np.power P,11 *np.power 1-P,9 ,          linestyle=":",          linewidth=4, label="likelihood function"  plt.axvline 0.55,              linestyle="--",             linewidth=4,              label="most likely p",            color="r"  plt.xlabel "Probability of obtaining head"  plt.ylabel "Likelihood function value"  plt.legend loc=[0.0,0.6] ;   144     Parametric Estimation  The result is as follows. The vertical dashed line indicates the maximum where p = 0.55:  Figure 6.3 – The likelihood function of the coin-tossing experiment You can verify visually that the likelihood function only has one maximum.  MLE for uniform distribution boundaries Let's first revisit our previous example, introduced in the Using the method of moments  to estimate parameters section, where the data is uniformly sampled from the range  [a,b], but both a and b are unknown. We don't need to do any hardcore calculation or  computational simulation to obtain the result with MLE. Suppose the data is denoted as x1, x2, up to xn. n is a large number, as we saw in the  previous section – 2,000. The likelihood function is therefore as follows:  𝐿𝐿 𝑎𝑎,𝑏𝑏 =  1𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎 𝑛𝑛   The logarithm will bring down the exponent n, which is a constant. So, what we want to   maximize is 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙  1𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎 =−𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎  , which further means we wish to minimize    log b-a .   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     145  Transformation of logarithm  Note that 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 1𝑥𝑥   is essentially 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑥𝑥−1  . You can pull the -1 out of the   logarithm.  Alright, the result is simple enough such that we don't need derivatives. When b becomes  smaller, log b-a  is smaller. When a is larger but must be smaller than b, log b-a  is  smaller. However, b is the upper bound, so it can't be smaller than the largest value of  the dataset, max xi , and by the same token, can't be larger than the smallest value of the  dataset, min xi . Therefore, the result reads as follows: A = min xi  b = max xi  This agrees with our intuition and we have fully exploited the information we can get from  such a dataset. Also, note that this is much more computationally cheaper than   the method of moments approach.   MLE for modeling noise Let's check another example that is deeply connected with regression models, which   we are going to see in future chapters. Here, we will approach it from the perspective   of estimators.  Regression and correlation A regression model detects relationships between variables, usually the  dependent variables  outcome  and the independent variables  features . The  regression model studies the direction of the correlation and the strength of the  correlation.   Let's say we anticipate that there is a correlation between random variable X and random  variable Y. For simplicity, we anticipate the relationship between them is just proportional,  namely Y ~ k * X. Here, k is an unknown constant, the coefficient of proportionality.  However, there is always some noise in a real-world example. The exact relationship  between X and Y is, therefore, Y = k * X + ε, where ε stands for the noise random variable.   146     Parametric Estimation  Let's say we have collected the n independent data pairs, xi and yi, at our disposal. The  following code snippet creates a scatter plot for these data points. For the demonstration,   I will choose n = 100:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.scatter X,Y  plt.xlabel "X"  plt.ylabel "Y"  plt.title "Linearly correlated variables with noise" ;   The result looks like the following:  Figure 6.4 – Scatter plot of X and Y  Instead of modeling the distribution of the data, as in the previous example, we are going  to model the noise since the linear relationship between X and Y is actually known. We  will see two cases where the modeling choices change the estimation of the coefficient of  proportionality k:     In the first case, the noise follows a standard normal distribution and can be shown   as N 0,1 .     In the second case, the noise follows a standard Laplace distribution.   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     147  A note on the two candidate distributions of noise Recall that a standard normal distribution has a PDF that is shown as   f x = 1√2πe−x22  . Laplace distribution is very similar to the standard normal  distribution. It has a PDF that can be presented as f 𝑥𝑥 =12𝑒𝑒−𝑥𝑥 . The big   difference is that one decays faster while the other decays slower. The positive  half of the standard Laplace distribution is just half of the exponential  distribution, with λ = 1.  The following code snippet plots the two distributions in one graph:  xs = np.linspace -5,5,100  normal_variables = 1 np.sqrt 2*np.pi *np.exp -0.5*xs**2  laplace_variables = 0.5*np.exp -np.abs xs    plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.plot xs,normal_variables,label="standard  normal",linestyle="--",linewidth=4  plt.plot xs,laplace_variables,label="standard  Laplace",linestyle=":",linewidth=4  plt.legend  ;  The result looks as in the following figure. The dashed line is the standard normal PDF  and the dotted line is the standard Laplace PDF:  Figure 6.5 – Standard normal and standard Laplace distribution around 0   148     Parametric Estimation    for every such random noise    I will model the noises according to the two distributions. However, the noise is indeed  generated from a standard normal distribution.  Let's first examine case 1. Suppose the noise, Є, follows the standard normal distribution.  This means Єi = yi - kxi, as you use other variables to represent Єi follows the given   data point.  Now, think of k is the hidden parameter. We just obtained our likelihood function for one  data point. As each data point is independent, the likelihood function can therefore be  aggregated to obtain the overall likelihood function, as shown in the following formula:  distribution. Therefore, we have f ϵik = 1√2πe− yi−kxi 2 2 L 𝑘𝑘 =f ϵ0,…,ϵ𝑛𝑛𝑘𝑘 =∏𝑓𝑓 ϵ𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘  𝑖𝑖 kMLE=argmaxkL k       What we want to find is k such that it maximizes the likelihood function. Let's introduce  the mathematical way to express this idea:  Let's take the logarithm of the likelihood function and make use of the rule that the  logarithm of a product is the sum of each term's logarithm.  Therefore, using the product rule to decompose the log-likelihood function, we have   𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑘𝑘 =∑𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑓𝑓 ϵ𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘    Note on simplifying the logarithm of a sum The rule of simplifying the likelihood function's expression is called the    . For each term, we have the following:  product rule of logarithm. It is shown as 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 ∏𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖 =∑ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖  . log 𝑓𝑓 ϵ𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘  =−0.5log 2π − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 2 𝑖𝑖 2 logL 𝑘𝑘 =−𝑛𝑛2log 2π −12∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 2      Substitute the expression into the log-likelihood function:  Note that the optimal k won't depend on the first term, which is a constant. So, we can  drop it and focus on the second part.    Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     149  Now, let's calculate the derivative with respect to k:  At the maximum of the function, the expression of the derivative will become 0. Equating  this to 0, we find the optimal value of k:     𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑘𝑘  =∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑘𝑘 𝑖𝑖 𝑘𝑘⋆=∑𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ∑𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖   On verifying maximality If you are familiar with calculus, you may wonder why I didn't calculate the  second derivative to verify that the value is indeed a maximum, rather than a  possible minimum. You are right that in principle, such a calculation is needed.  However, in our examples in this chapter, the functional forms are quite simple:  like a simple quadratic form with only one maximum. The calculation is  therefore omitted.  The following code snippet does the calculation. Note that if a variable is a NumPy array,  you can perform element-wise calculation directly:  np.sum X*Y  np.sum X*X   The result is 0.40105608977245294. Let's visualize it to check how well this estimation does. The following code snippet adds  the estimated y values to the original scatter plot as a dashed bold line:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.scatter X,Y,alpha = 0.4  plt.xlabel "X"  plt.ylabel "Y"  plt.plot X,X*k_1,linewidth=4,linestyle="--",c="r",  label="fitted line"  plt.legend  ;   150     Parametric Estimation  The result looks as follows:  Figure 6.6 – Estimated Y value according to normal noise assumption  The result looks quite reasonable.  Now, let's try the other case. The logic of MLE remains the same until we take the   exact form of the likelihood function, f Єik . The likelihood function for the second   Laplace-distributed noise case is the following:  Taking the logarithm, the log-likelihood has a form as follows. I have removed the  irrelevant constant 0.5 as I did in the coin-tossing example to simplify the calculation:  L k  =∏f ϵ𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 =∏12𝑒𝑒−𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖.  logL k =−∑yi –𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖   In order to maximize the log-likelihood function, we need to minimize the summation  ∑yi–kxi. This summation involves absolute values, and the sign of each term depends on the value  of k. Put the book down and think for a while about the minimization.   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     151  Let's define a function, sign x , which gives us the sign of x. If x is positive, sign x  = 1, if x  is negative, sign x  = -1; otherwise, it is 0. Then, the derivative of the preceding summation  with respect to k is essentially the following:  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑘𝑘  𝑑𝑑𝑘𝑘  =∑𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖sign 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 =0   Because the sign x  function jumps, it is still not easy to get a hint. Let's do a  computational experiment. I will pick k between 0 and 1, then create a graph of  the log-likelihood function values and the derivatives so that you can have a visual  impression. The following code snippet creates the data I needed:  Ks = np.linspace 0.2,0.6,100   def cal_log_likelihood X, Y, k :     return -np.sum np.abs Y-k*X   def cal_derivative X,Y,k :     return np.sum X*np.sign Y-k*X    Likelihoods = [cal_log_likelihood X,Y,k  for k in Ks] Derivatives = [cal_derivative X,Y,k  for k in Ks]  I picked the range [0.2,0.6] and selected k values for a 0.04 increment. Why did I pick this  range? This is just a first guess from the scatter plot. The following code snippet plots the results:  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.plot Ks,Likelihoods,label="Likelihood  function",linestyle="--",linewidth=4  plt.plot Ks,Derivatives,label=  "Derivative",linestyle=":",linewidth=4  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "K" ;   152     Parametric Estimation  The dashed line is the likelihood function value and the dotted line is the derivative of the  likelihood function:  Figure 6.7 – Searching for the optimal k point through computational experimentation You may notice that there seems to be a plateau for the functions. This is true. Let's   zoom in to the range where k takes the value [0.38,0.42]. The following code snippet does   the job:  Ks = np.linspace 0.38,0.42,100  Likelihoods = [cal_log_likelihood X,Y,k  for k in Ks] Derivatives = [cal_derivative X,Y,k  for k in Ks] plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.plot Ks,Likelihoods,label="Likelihood  function",linestyle="--",linewidth=4  plt.plot Ks,Derivatives,label=  "Derivative",linestyle=":",linewidth=4  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "K" ;   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     153  The result looks like the following:  Figure 6.8 – The plateau of derivatives  This strange behavior comes from the fact that taking the derivative of the absolute value  function lost information about the value itself. We only have information about the sign  of the value left. However, we can still obtain an estimation of the optimal value by using  the numpy.argmax function. This function returns the index of the maximal value in  an array. We can then use this index to index the array for our k values. The following  one-line code snippet does the job:  Ks[np.argmax Likelihoods ]  The result is about 0.397. Then, we know the real k values are in the range [0.397 – 0.0004,  0.397 + 0.0004], which is smaller than our result from case 1. Why 0.0004? We divide a  range of 0.04 into 100 parts equally, so each grid is 0.0004.   154     Parametric Estimation  Let's plot both results together. They are almost indistinguishable. The following code  snippet plots them together:  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.scatter X,Y,alpha = 0.4  plt.xlabel "X"  plt.ylabel "Y"  plt.plot X,X*k_1,linewidth=4,linestyle="--",c="r",  label="estimation from \nnormal noise assumption"  plt.plot X,X*k_2,linewidth=4,linestyle=":",c="g",  label="estimation from \nLaplace noise assumption"  plt.legend  ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 6.9 – Estimations of the coefficient of proportionality   Alright, we are almost done. Let's find out how the data is generated. The following code  snippet tells you that it is indeed generated from the normal distribution:  random.seed 2020  X = np.linspace -10,10,100  Y = X * 0.4 + np.array [random.normalvariate 0,1  for _ in  range 100 ]    Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     155  In this example, we modeled the random noise with two different distributions.  However, rather than a simple unknown parameter, our unknown parameter now carries  correlation information between data points. This is a common technique to use MLE to  estimate unknown parameters in a model, by assuming a distribution. We used two different distributions to model the noise. However, the results are not very  different. This is not always the case. Sometimes, poorly modeled noise will lead to the  wrong parameter estimation.  MLE and the Bayesian theorem Another important question remaining in a real-world case is how to build comprehensive  modeling with simply the raw data. The likelihood function is important, but it may miss  another important factor: the prior distribution of the parameter itself, which may be  independent of the observed data. To have a solid discussion on this extended topic, let  me first introduce the Bayesian theorem for general events A and B. The Bayesian theorem builds the connection between P AB  and P BA  through the  following rule:  This mathematical equation is derived from the definition of the conditional     are both true statements, therefore   Why is the Bayesian rule important? To answer this question, let's replace A with  observation O and B with the hidden, unknown parameter λ:     P 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 ∗𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵    and 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 =𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵  distribution. 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵  𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵  𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵  = 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 ,  which gives the Bayesian's rule. P 𝑂𝑂λ =𝑃𝑃 λ𝑂𝑂 ∗𝑃𝑃 𝑂𝑂  𝑃𝑃 λ   Now, let's assign real-life meaning to parts of the equation:        P 0λ  is the likelihood function we wish to maximize.    P λ0  is a posterior probability of λ.     P λ  is a prior probability of λ.    P O  is essentially 1 because it is observed, therefore determined.   156     Parametric Estimation  If you have forgotten the concepts of posterior probability and prior probability, please  refer to the Understanding the important concepts section in Chapter 5, Common  Probability Distributions. The Bayesian theorem basically says that the likelihood  probability is just the ratio of posterior probability and prior probability. Recall that the  posterior distribution is a corrected or adjusted probability of the unknown parameter.  The stronger our observation O suggests a particular value of λ, the bigger the ratio of   𝑃𝑃 λ𝑂𝑂  𝑃𝑃 λ   is. In both of our previous cases, P λ  is invisible because we don't have any prior   knowledge about λ. Why is prior knowledge of the unknown parameter important? Let's again use the coin- tossing game, not an experiment anymore, as an example. Suppose the game can be done  by one of two persons, Bob or Curry. Bob is a serious guy, who is not so playful. Bob prefers using a fair coin over an unfair coin. 80% of the time, Bob uses the fair coin.  Curry is a naughty boy. He randomly picks a fair coin or unfair coin for the game, fifty- fifty. Will you take the fact of who you are playing the game with into consideration? Of  course, you will!  If you play with Curry, you will end up with the same analysis of solving MLE problems  as coin tossing and noise modeling. Earlier, we didn't assume anything about the prior  information of p. However, if you play with Bob, you know that he is more serious and  honest, therefore he is unlikely to use an unfair coin. You need to factor this into your  decision. One common mistake that data scientists make is the ignorance of prior distribution of  the unknown parameter, which leads to the wrong likelihood function. The calculation of  the modified coin tossing is left to you as an exercise. The Bayesian theorem is often utilized together with the law of total probability. It has an  expression as follows:  P 𝐴𝐴 =∑𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖   𝑖𝑖  =∑𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖  𝑖𝑖     We won't prove it mathematically here, but you may think of it in the following way:  1.  For the first equals sign, for the enumeration of all mutually exclusive events, Bi,   each Bi overlaps with event A to some extent; therefore, the aggregation of the  events Bi will complete the whole set of A.  2.  For the second equals sign, we apply the definition of conditional probability to   each term of the summation.    Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     157  Example of the law of total probability Suppose you want to know the probability that a baby's name is Adrian in the  US. Since Adrian is a gender-neutral baby name, you can calculate it using the  law of total probability as P Adrian  = P Adrianboy  * P boy  + P Adriangirl   * P girl .  The last example in this chapter is the famous Monty Hall question. It will deepen your  understanding of the Bayesian rule. You are on a show to win a prize. There is a huge prize behind one of three doors. Now,  you pick door A: the host opens door B and finds it empty. You are offered a second  chance to switch to door C or stick to door A, what should you do? The prior probability   for each door, A, B, or C, is 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 =𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐶𝐶 =13.  The host will always try to open an   empty door after you select: if you selected a door without the prize, the host will open  another empty door. If you select the door with the prize, the host will open one of the  remaining doors randomly. Let's use EB to denote the event that door B is opened by the host, which is already  observed. Which pair of the following probabilities should you calculate and compare?   The likelihood of P EBA  and P EBC         The posterior probability P AEB  and P CEB   The answer is the posterior probability. Without calculation, you know P EBA  is 12 .Why?    Because if the prize is in fact behind door A, door B is simply selected randomly by the   host. However, this information alone will not give us guidance on the next action.  The posterior probability is what we want because it instructs us what to do after the  observation. Let's calculate P AEB  first. According to the Bayesian rule and the law of total probability,  we have the following equation:  𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵   =  𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴   𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 +𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 +𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶 𝑃𝑃 𝐶𝐶     158     Parametric Estimation  probability is 0.     P EBA : The prize is behind door A, so the host has an equal chance of randomly   Let's go over the several conditional probabilities together:  P 𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵 =  Now, what is P EBC ? It is 1 because the host is sure to pick the empty door to   confuse you:  12∗13 12∗13+0∗13+1∗13=13  selecting from door B and door C. This probability is 12 . By the same token, 𝑃𝑃 𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵 =23 . The calculation is left to you as a small exercise.     P EBC : The prize is behind door C, so the host will definitely open door B.      P EBB : The prize is behind door B, so the host will not open door B at all. This   Otherwise, opening door C will reveal the prize. This probability is essentially 1.  This is counter-intuitive. You should switch, rather than sticking to your original choice!  From the first impression, since the door the host opens is empty, there should be an equal  chance that the prize will be in one of the two remaining two doors equally. The devil is in  the details. The host has to open a door that is empty. You will see from a computational  sense about the breaking of symmetry in terms of choices. First, let's ask the question of whether we can do a computational experiment to verify the  results. The answer is yes, but the setup is a little tricky. The following code does the job,  and I will explain it in detail:  import random random.seed 2020  doors = ["A","B","C"] count, stick, switch = 0, 0, 0 trials = [] for i in range 10000 :     prize = random.choice doors      pick = random.choice doors      reveal = random.choice doors      trial = 1     while reveal == prize or reveal == pick:   Applying the maximum likelihood approach with Python     159          reveal = random.choice doors          trial+=1     trials.append trial      if reveal != pick and reveal != prize:         count += 1         if pick== prize:             stick +=1         else:             switch += 1 print "total experiment: {}".format count   print "times of switch: {}".format switch   print "times of stick: {}".format stick    Run it and you will see the following results:  total experiment: 10000 times of switch: 6597 times of stick: 3403  Indeed, you should switch. The code follows the following logic:  1.  For 10,000 experiments, the prize is pre-selected randomly. The user's pick is also   randomly selected. The user may or may not pick the prize.  2.  Then, the host reveals one of the doors. However, we know that the host will reveal  one empty door from the remaining two doors for sure. We use the trial variable  to keep track of the times that we try to generate a random selection to meet this  condition. This variable is also appended to a list object whose name is trials.  3.  At last, we decide whether to switch or not.  The symmetry is broken when the host tries to pick the empty door. Let's use the  following code to show the distribution of trials:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.hist trials,bins = 40 ;   160     Parametric Estimation  The plot looks like the following:  Figure 6.10 – Number of trials in the computer simulation  In our plain simulation, in order to meet the condition that the host wants to satisfy, we  must do random selection more than one time, and sometimes even more than 10 times.  This is where the bizarreness hides. Enough said on the Bayesian theorem; you have grasped the foundation of MLE. MLE  is a simplified scenario of the Bayesian approach to estimation by assuming the prior  distribution of the unknown parameter is uniform.   Summary In this chapter, we covered two important methods of parameter estimation: the method  of moments and MLE. You then learned the background of MLE, the Bayesian way of  modeling the likelihood function, and so on. However, we don't know how well our  estimators perform, yet. In general, it requires a pipeline of hypothesis testing with a  quantitative argument to verify a claim. We will explore the rich world of hypothesis  testing in the next chapter, where we will put our hypotheses assumptions to the test.   7 Statistical  Hypothesis Testing  In Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation, you learned two important parameter estimation  methods, namely, the method of moments and MLE. The underlying assumption for  parameter estimation is that we know that the data follows a specific distribution,   but we do not know the details of the parameters, and so we estimate the parameters.  Parametric estimation offers an estimation, but most of the time we also want a  quantitative argument of confidence. For example, if the sample mean from one  population is larger than the sample mean from another population, is it enough to say  the mean of the first population is larger than that of the second one? To obtain an answer  to this question, you need statistical hypothesis testing, which is another method of  statistical inference of massive power. In this chapter, you are going to learn about the following topics:     An overview of hypothesis testing    Making sense of confidence intervals and P values from visual examples    Using the SciPy Python library to do common hypothesis testing   162     Statistical Hypothesis Testing     Understanding the ANOVA model and corresponding testing    Applying hypothesis testing to time series problems    Appreciating A B testing with real-world examples  Some concepts in this chapter are going to be subtle. Buckle up and let's get started!  An overview of hypothesis testing To begin with the overview, I would like to share an ongoing example from while I was  writing this book. As the coronavirus spread throughout the world, pharmaceutical  and biotechnology companies worked around the clock to develop drugs and vaccines.  Scientists estimated that it would take at least a year for a vaccine to be available. To  verify the effectiveness and safety of a vaccine or drug, clinical trials needed to be done  cautiously and thoroughly at different stages. It is a well-known fact that most drugs and  vaccines won't reach the later trial stages and only a handful of them ultimately reach   the market. How do clinical trials work? In short, the process of screening medicines   is a process of hypothesis testing.  A hypothesis is just a statement or claim about the statistics or parameters describing a  studied population. In clinical trials, the hypothesis that a medicine is effective or safe is  being tested. The simplest scenario includes two groups of patients selected randomly. You  treat one group with the drug and another without the drug and control the rest of the  factors. Then, the trial conductors will measure specific signals to compare the differences,  for example, the concentration of the virus in the respiratory system or the number of  days to full recovery. The trial conductors then decide whether the differences or the  statistics calculated are significant enough. You can pre-select a significance level, α, to  check whether the trial results meet the expected level of significance. Now, imagine you observe the average math course scores for 9th grade students in a  school. You naturally assume that the distribution of each year's math course scores  follows a normal distribution. However, you find this year's sample average score,    μ2020 , is slightly below last year's population average score, 75. Do you think this finding   just comes from the randomness of sampling, or is the fundamental level of math skills of  all students deteriorating? You can use MLE or the methods of the moment to fit this year's data to a normal  distribution and compare the fitted mean. However, this still doesn't give you a quantitative  argument of confidence. In a score-based  a score out of 100  grading system, let's say  last year's average score for all students is 75 and the average score for your 2020 class, a  900-student sample, is 73. Is the decrease real? How small or big is the two-point difference?   An overview of hypothesis testing     163  To answer these questions, we first need to clarify what constitutes a valid hypothesis.  Here are two conditions:     The statement must be expressed mathematically. For example, this year's average  score is the same as last year's is a valid statement. This statement can be expressed   as 𝐻𝐻0:μ2020=75  with no ambiguity. However, this year's average score is roughly the   same as last year's is not a valid statement because different people have different  assessments of what is roughly the same.     The statement should be testable. A valid statement is about the statistics of   observed data. If the statement requires data other than the observed data, the  statement is not testable. For example, you can't test the differences in students'  English scores if only math scores are given.  This famous saying by the statistician Fisher summarizes the requirements for a  hypothesis well, although he was talking about the null hypothesis specifically:  The null hypothesis must be exact, that is, free of vagueness and ambiguity,  because it must supply the basis of the "problem of distribution," of which   the test of significance is the solution.  Now we are ready to proceed more mathematically. Let's rephrase the math score problem  as follows. The average math score for the previous year's 9th grade students is 75. This year, you  randomly sample 900 students and find the sample mean is 73. You want to know   whether the average score for this year's students is lower than last year's.  To begin hypothesis testing, the following three steps are required:   1.  Formulate a null hypothesis. A null hypothesis basically says there is nothing special   going on. In our math score example, it means there is no difference between this  year's score and last year's score. A null hypothesis is denoted by H0. On the other  hand, the corresponding alternative hypothesis states the opposite of the null   hypothesis. It is denoted by H1 or Hα. In our example, you can use 𝐻𝐻1:μ2020≠75 .   Note that different choices of null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis will lead   to different results in terms of accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.   164     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  2.  Pick a test statistic that can be used to assess how well the null hypothesis holds  and calculate it. A test statistic is a random variable that you will calculate from  the sampled data under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Then, you  calculate the P-value according to the known distribution of this test statistic. 3.  Compute the P-value from the test statistic and compare it with an acceptable   significance level, α.   Gosh! So many new terms! Don't worry, let's go back to our examples and you will see this  unfold gradually. After that, you will be able to understand these concepts in a coherent  way. You will be able to follow these three steps to approach various kinds of hypothesis  testing problems in a unified setting.   Understanding P-values, test statistics, and  significance levels To explain the concepts with the math example, let's first get a visual impression of the  data. I will be using two sample math scores for 900 students in 2019 and sample math  scores for 900 students in 2020.  Note on given facts The dataset for 2019 is not necessary for hypothesis testing because we are  given the fact that the average score for 2019 is exactly 75. I will generate the  datasets to provide you with a clear comparable visualization.   At this point, I am not going to tell you how I generated the 2020 data; otherwise, the  ground truth would be revealed to you beforehand. I do assure you that the data for 2019  is generated from sampling a normal distribution with a mean of 75 and a variance of 25. The two datasets are called math2020 and math2019. Each of them contains 900 data  points. Let me plot them with histogram plots so you know roughly what they look like.  The following code snippet does the job:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.hist math2020,bins=np. linspace 50,100,50 ,alpha=0.5,label="math2020"  plt.hist math2019,bins=np. linspace 50,100,50 ,alpha=0.5,label="math2019"  plt.legend  ;   Note that I explicitly set the bins to make sure the bin boundaries are fully determined.  The result looks as follows:  An overview of hypothesis testing     165  Figure 7.1 – Histogram plot of math scores from 2020 and 2019  Note that the scores from 2020 do seem to have a smaller mean than the scores from 2019,  which is supposed to be very close to 75. Instead of calling the corresponding numpy  functions, I will just use the following describe   function from the scipy library's  stats module:  from scipy import stats stats.describe math2020   The result is the following:  DescribeResult nobs=900, minmax= 53.61680120097629,  93.29408158813376 , mean=72.89645796453996,  variance=24.81446705891462, skewness=0.007960630504578523,  kurtosis=0.3444548003252992   Do the same thing for the year 2019. I find that the mean for the year 2019 is around 75. In Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics, we discussed the issue of sampling, which  itself involves randomness. Is the difference in means an artifact of randomness or is it  real? To answer this question, let's first embed some definitions into our example, starting  with the null hypothesis. A null hypothesis basically says YES: everything is due to randomness. An alternative  hypothesis says NO to randomness and claims that there are fundamental differences.   A hypothesis test is tested against the null hypothesis to see whether there is evidence   to reject it or not.    166     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  hypothesis must cover all possible cases. The first case is called a two-tailed hypothesis   Back to the math score problem. We can pick the null hypothesis 𝐻𝐻0:μ2020=75  and   set the alternative hypothesis 𝐻𝐻1:μ2020≠75  . Or, we can choose 𝐻𝐻0:μ2020≥75  and set   𝐻𝐻1:μ2020<75 . Note that the combination of the null hypothesis and the alternative  because either μ2020 75  will be a rebuttal of our null hypothesis. The   alternative is a one-tailed hypothesis. Since we only want to test whether our mean score  is less than or equal to 75, we choose the one-tailed hypothesis for our example. Even in  the null hypothesis, the mean can be larger than 75, but we know this is going to have a   negligible likelihood.  On the choice of one-tailed or two-tailed hypotheses Whether to use a one-tailed hypothesis or a two-tailed hypothesis depends on  the task at hand. One big difference is that choosing a two-tailed alternative  hypothesis requires an equal split of the significance level on both sides.   What we have now is a dataset, a null hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis. The next   step is to find evidence to test the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis reads 𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇2020≥75 ,  whereas the alternative hypothesis reads  𝐻𝐻1:μ2020 < 75 .  After setting up the hypothesis, the next step is to find a rule to measure the strength  of the evidence, or in other words, to quantify the risk of making mistakes that reject a  true null hypothesis. The significance level, α, is essentially an index of the likelihood of  making the mistake of rejecting a true null hypothesis.  For example, if a medicine under trial is useless, α = 0.05 means that we set a threshold  that at the chance of less than or equal to 5%, we may incorrectly conclude that the  medicine is useful. If we set the bar way lower, at α = 0.001, it means that we are very   picky about the evidence. In other words, we want to minimize the cases where we   are so unlucky that randomness leads us to the wrong conclusion.  As we continue to talk about significance, all hypothesis testing to be discussed in this  chapter will be done with statistical significance tests. A statistical significance test  assumes the null hypothesis is correct until evidence that contradicts the null hypothesis  shows up.  Another perspective of hypothesis testing treats the null hypothesis and the alternative  hypothesis equally and tests which one fits the statistical model better. I only mention it  here for completeness.   Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     167  To summarize, if the evidence and test statistics show contradictions against the null  hypothesis with high statistical significance  smaller α values , we reject the null  hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the hypothesis. Whether you reject the null  hypothesis or not, there is a chance that you will make mistakes.   Note  Hypothesis testing includes the test of correlation or independence. In this  chapter, we mainly focus on the test of differences. However, claiming two  variables are correlated or independent is a legitimate statement hypothesis  that can be tested.    Making sense of confidence intervals and  P-values from visual examples P-values determine whether a research proposal will be funded, whether a publication will  be accepted, or at least whether an experiment is interesting or not. To start with, let me  give you some bullet points about P-values' properties:     The P-value is a magical probability, but it is not the probability that the null   hypothesis will be accepted. Statisticians tend to search for supportive evidence for  the alternative hypothesis because the null hypothesis is boring. Nobody wants to  hear that there is nothing interesting going on.     The P-value is the probability of making mistakes if you reject the null hypothesis.   If the P-value is very small, it means that you can safely reject the null hypothesis  without worrying too much that you made mistakes because randomness tricked  you. If the P-value is 1, it means that you have absolutely no reason to reject the null  hypothesis, because what you get from the test statistic is the most typical results  under the null hypothesis.     The P-value is defined in the way it is so that it can be comparable to the significance  level, α. If we obtain a P-value smaller than the significance level, we say the result is  significant at significance level α. The risk of making a mistake that rejects the null  hypothesis wrongly is acceptable. If the P-value is not smaller than α, the result is  not significant.   168     Statistical Hypothesis Testing     From first principles, the P-value of an event is also the summed probability of   observing the event and all events with equal or smaller probability. This definition  doesn't contradict the point about contradicting the null hypothesis. Note that  under the assumption of a true null hypothesis, the cumulative probability of  observing our test statistics and all other equal or rarer values of test statistics   is the probability of mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis.  The importance of first-principles thinking First-principles thinking is very important in studying statistics and  programming. It is advised that you resist the temptation to use rules and  procedures to get things done quickly but instead learn the definitions and  concepts, so you have a foundation in terms of first principles.  Please read the definition of the P-value carefully to make sure you fully understand it.  Before moving on to a concrete example of test statistics, let's have a look at the P-value  from two examples from first principles. The importance of correctly understanding the  P-value cannot be stressed enough.  Calculating the P-value from discrete events In our first example, we will study the probability and the P-value of events in coin-tossing  experiments. Let's toss a fair coin 6 times and count the total number of heads. There are 7  possibilities, from 0 heads to 6 heads. We can calculate the probability either theoretically  or computationally. I will just do a quick experiment with the following lines of code and  compare the results with the theoretical values. The following code snippet generates the experiment results for 1 million tosses and stores  the results in the results variable:  random.seed 2020  results = [] for _ in range 1000000 :     results.append sum [random.random   < 0.5 for i in  range 6 ]    The following code snippet normalizes the results and lists them alongside the   theoretical results:  from collections import Counter from math import factorial as factorial counter = Counter results    Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     169  for head in sorted counter.keys   :     comput = counter[head] 1000000     theory = 0.5**6*factorial 6  factorial head  factorial 6- head      print "heads: {}; Computational: {}; Theoretical: {}". format head,comput, theory    The results look as follows. The computational results agree with the theoretical results  pretty well:  heads: 0; Computational: 0.015913; Theoretical: 0.015625 heads: 1; Computational: 0.093367; Theoretical: 0.09375 heads: 2; Computational: 0.234098; Theoretical: 0.234375 heads: 3; Computational: 0.312343; Theoretical: 0.3125 heads: 4; Computational: 0.234654; Theoretical: 0.234375 heads: 5; Computational: 0.093995; Theoretical: 0.09375 heads: 6; Computational: 0.01563; Theoretical: 0.015625  Let's answer the following questions to help us clarify the definition of the P-value. The  answers should be based on theoretical results:  1.  What is the probability of getting 5 heads, what about P-value?   The probability is 0.09375. However, the P-value is the sum of 0.09375 + 0.09375  + 0.015625 + 0.015625 = 0.21875. The P-value is the probability of you seeing such  events with equal probability or rarer probability. Getting 1 head is equally likely  as getting 5 heads. Getting 6 heads or 0 heads is more extreme. With a P-value of  roughly 0, we say that the event of observing 5 heads is quite typical. The P-value for  observing 6 heads is about 0.031. The calculation is left to you as an exercise.  2.  What is the P-value of getting 3 heads?   The surprising answer here is 1. Among all 7 kinds of possibilities, getting 3 heads is  the most likely outcome; therefore, the rest of the outcomes are all rarer than getting  3 heads. Another implication is that there are no other events that are more typical  than observing 3 heads.   Now, you should have a better understanding of the P-value by having treated it as a  measurement of typicalness. In the next section, let's move on to a case involving the continuous Probability Density  Function  PDF  case, where we need some integration.   170     Statistical Hypothesis Testing Calculating the P-value from the continuous PDF We just calculated P-values from discrete events. Now let's examine a continuous  distribution. The distribution I am going to use is the F-distribution. The F-distribution is  the distribution we are going to use in the analysis of the variance test later, so it is good to  have a first impression here. The analytical form of the F-distribution is parameterized by  two degrees of freedom, d1 and d2 ~ F d1, d2 . If x is greater than 0, the PDF is as follows.  The B x,y  function is called the beta function, and it's a special kind of function. If you  are familiar with calculus, it has the following definition as an integration:  f 𝑥𝑥,𝑑𝑑1,𝑑𝑑2 =     1𝐵𝐵 𝑑𝑑12,𝑑𝑑22  𝑑𝑑1𝑑𝑑2 𝑑𝑑12𝑥𝑥𝑑𝑑12−1 1+𝑑𝑑1𝑑𝑑2𝑥𝑥 −𝑑𝑑1+𝑑𝑑22 1 B 𝑥𝑥,𝑦𝑦 =∫𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑥−1 1−𝑡𝑡 𝑦𝑦−1dt 0     Fortunately, we don't need to write our own function to generate these samples. The  scipy library provides another handy function, f, for us to use. The following code snippet generates the PDFs with four pairs of parameters and   plots them:  from scipy.stats import f  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   styles = ["-",":","--","-."] for i, [dfn, dfd] in  enumerate [[20,30],[20,60],[50,30],[50,60]] :     x = np.linspace f.ppf 0.001, dfn, dfd , f.ppf 0.999, dfn,  dfd , 100      plt.plot x, f.pdf x, dfn, dfd , linestyle= styles[i],               lw=4, alpha=0.6,               label='{} {}'.format dfn,dfd   plt.legend  ;   Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     171  The plotted graph looks like this:  Figure 7.2 – The F-distribution PDF  The probability distribution function of the F-distribution is not symmetrical; it is right- skewed with a long tail. Let's say you have a random variable, x, following the distribution  F 20,60 . If you observe x to be 1.5, what is the P-value for this observation? The following code snippet highlights the region where the equal or rare events are  highlighted in red. I generated 100 linearly spaced data points and stored them in the x  variable and selected those rarer observations on the right and those on the left:  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   [dfn, dfd] =[20,60] x = np.linspace f.ppf 0.001, dfn, dfd , f.ppf 0.999, dfn, dfd ,  100  plt.plot x,           f.pdf x, dfn, dfd ,           linestyle= "--",           lw=4, alpha=0.6,           label='{} {}'.format dfn,dfd   right = x[x>1.5] left = x[f.pdf x, dfn, dfd  < f.pdf right,dfn,dfd [0]][0:8] plt.fill_between right,f. pdf right,dfn,dfd ,alpha=0.4,color="r"  plt.fill_between left,f.pdf left,dfn,dfd ,alpha=0.4,color="r"  plt.legend  ;   172     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  There is a little bit of hardcoding here where I manually selected the left part of the   shaded area. You are free to inspect the expression of the left variable. The result looks   as follows:  Figure 7.3 – A rarer observation than 1.5 in F 20,60   The integration of the shaded area gives us the P-value for observing the value 1.5. The  following code snippet uses the Cumulative Distribution Function  CDF  to calculate  the value:  f.cdf left[-1],dfn,dfd  +  1-f.cdf right[0],dfn,dfd    The P-value is about 0.138, so not very bad. It is somewhat typical to observe a 1.5  from such an F-distribution. If your pre-selected significance level is α = 0.05, then this  observation is not significant enough. By now, you should understand the definition and implication of the P-value from first  principles. The remaining question is, what exactly is the P-value in a hypothesis test?   The answer involves test statistics.  In the second step of hypothesis testing, we calculate the best kind of statistic and check its  P-value against a pre-selected significance level.  In the math score example, we want to compare a sample mean against a constant; this is  a one-sample, one-tailed test. The statistic we want to use is the t-statistic. The specific  hypothesis test we want to apply is Student's t-test. Please bear with me on the new  concepts. The t-statistic is nothing special; it's just another random variable that follows  a specific distribution, which follows Student's t-distribution. We will cover both specific  and Student's t-distribution shortly, with clear definitions and visualizations.   Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     173  Tests and test statistics Different problems require different test statistics. If you want to test the  differences in samples across several categories or groups, you should use the  Analysis of Variance  ANOVA  F-test. If you want to test the independence  of two variables in a population, you should use the Chi-square test, which we  will cover very soon.  Under the null hypothesis, the t-statistic t is calculated as follows:  t=μ2020−75 𝑠𝑠 √𝑛𝑛     n is the sample size and s is the sample standard deviation. The random variable t follows  Student's t-distribution with a degree of freedom of n-1.  Student's t-distribution Student's t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution used when  estimating the mean of a normally distributed distribution with an unknown  population standard deviation and a small sample size. It has a complicated  PDF with a parameter called the Degree of Freedom  DOF . We won't go into  the formula of the PDF as it's convoluted, but I will show you the relationship  between the DOF and the shape of the t-distribution PDF.   The following code snippet plots the t-distributions with various DOFs alongside the  standard normal distribution functions. Here I use the scipy.stats module:  from scipy.stats import t, norm plt.figure figsize= 12,6   DOFs = [2,4,8] linestyles= [":","--","-."] for i, df in enumerate DOFs :     x = np.linspace -4, 4, 100      rv = t df      plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=2, label= "DOF = " +  str df ,linestyle=linestyles[i] ;  plt.plot x,norm 0,1 .pdf x ,'k-', lw=2, label="Standard  Normal"  plt.legend  ;   174     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The result looks like the following. Pay attention to the line styles. As you see, when the  DOF increases, the t-distribution PDF tends to approach the standard normal distribution  with larger and larger centrality:  Figure 7.4 – The Student's t-distribution PDF and a standard normal PDF  substituting the numbers, we can get the value of our t-statistic using the following code:    follows the t-distribution with a DOF of 899. By   Alright, our statistic t=μ2020−75 𝑠𝑠 √𝑛𝑛  The result is about -12.6758.   np.mean math2020 -75   np.std math2020  30   Replacing the t-distribution with a normal distribution With a large DOF  899 in our case , the t-distribution will be completely  indistinguishable from a normal distribution. In practice, you can use a normal  distribution to do the test safely.   Significance levels in t-distribution Let's say we selected a significance level of α = 0.01. Is our result significant enough? We  need to find out whether our result exceeds the threshold of the significance level 0.01. The t-distribution doesn't have an easy-to-calculate PDF, so given a significance level of   α = 0.01, how do we easily find the threshold s ?  Before the advent of easy-to-use libraries or programs, people used to build t-statistics  tables to solve this issue. For a given significance level, you can basically look up the table  and find the corresponding t-statistic value.    Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     175  As the t-distribution is symmetric, the importance of whether you are doing a one-tail test  or a two-tailed test increases. Let's first check a t-distribution table for a one-tail test. For  example, with a DOF of 5, to be significant at the 0.05 level, the t-statistic needs to   be 2.015:  Figure 7.5 – The t-distribution table for one-tailed significance levels  For a more intuitive impression, the following code snippet plots the different thresholds  of the t-distribution PDF:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   df = 5 x = np.linspace -8, 8, 200  rv = t df  plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=4,linestyle="--" ; alphas = [0.1,0.05,0.025,0.01,0.005,0.001,0.0005] threasholds = [1.476,2.015,2.571,3.365,4.032,5.894,6.869] for thre, alpha in zip threasholds,alphas :     plt.plot [thre,thre],[0,rv.pdf thre ] ,label = "{}". format str alpha  ,linewidth=4  plt.legend  ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.6 – The significance levels for a t-statistics distribution with DOF=5   Adding the following two lines will zoom into the range that we are interested in:  176     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  plt.xlim -2,8  plt.ylim 0,0.15   The result looks as follows. If you can't distinguish the colors, just remember that the  smaller the significance level is, the further away the threshold is from the origin:  Figure 7.7 – A zoomed-in t-distribution showing different significance levels  As the significance level decreases  that is, as α decreases , we tend toward keeping the  null hypothesis because it becomes increasingly harder to observe a sample with such   low probability. Next, let's check the two-tailed t-distribution table. The two-tailed case means that we  must consider both ends of the symmetric distribution. The summation of both gives us  the significance level:  Figure 7.8 – The t-distribution table for two-tailed significance levels   Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     177  Notice that for α = 0.2, the t-statistic is the same as α = 0.1 for a one-tailed test. The  following code snippet illustrates the relationship between t-statistic and one-tailed test,  using α = 0.01 as an example. I picked the most important region to show:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   df = 5 x = np.linspace -8, 8, 200  rv = t df  plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=4,linestyle="--" ; alpha=0.01 one_tail = 3.365 two_tail = 4.032 plt.plot [one_tail,one_tail],[0,rv.pdf one_tail ] ,          label = "one_tail",linewidth=4,linestyle="--"  plt.plot [two_tail,two_tail],[0,rv.pdf two_tail ] ,          label = "two  tail",linewidth=4,color="r",linestyle=":"  plt.plot [-two_tail,-two_tail],[0,rv.pdf two_tail ] ,          label = "two  tail",linewidth=4,color="r",linestyle=":"   plt.fill_between np.linspace -8,-two_tail,200 ,                  rv.pdf np.linspace -8,-two_ tail,200  ,color="g"  plt.fill_between np.linspace one_tail,two_tail,200 ,                  rv.pdf np.linspace one_tail,two_ tail,200  ,color="g"  plt.ylim 0,0.02  plt.legend  ;   178     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.9 – A comparison of two-tailed and one-tailed results for the same significance level  You need to trust me that the shaded parts have the same area. The one-tailed case only  covers the region to the right of the vertical dashed line  the left edge of the right shaded  area , but the two-tailed case covers both sides symmetrically  the outer portion of the  two dotted vertical lines . Since the significance levels are the same, they should both  cover the same area under the curve  AUC , which leads to the equal area of the two  shaded regions. For our one-sided test, our t-statistic is less than -10. It is equivalent to the threshold  for the positive value because of the symmetry of the problem. If you look up the  t-distribution table, with such a large DOF of 899, the difference between large DOFs   is quite small. For example, the following two rows are found at the end of the   t-distribution table:  Figure 7.10 – A t-distribution table with very large DOFs  In the math score example, the absolute value 12.67 for our t-statistic is far away from  both 2.358 and 2.330. We have enough confidence to reject the null hypothesis, which  means that the alternative hypothesis is true: indeed, students' math skills have declined.   Making sense of confidence intervals and P-values from visual examples     179  The following code snippet reveals how I generated the score data:  random.seed 2020  math2019 = [random.normalvariate 75,5  for _ in range 900 ] math2020 = [random.normalvariate 73,5  for _ in range 900 ]  Feel free to reproduce the random data generated to visualize it yourself. Next, let's  examine another concept in hypothesis testing: power.  The power of a hypothesis test I will briefly mention another concept you may see from other materials: the power of a  hypothesis test. The power of hypothesis testing is the probability of making the correct  decision if the alternative hypothesis is true.  It is easier to approach this concept from its complementary part. The opposite side of this  is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis H0 while the alternative hypothesis  H1 is true. This is called a type II error. The smaller the type II error is, the greater the  power will be. Intuitively speaking, greater power means the test is more likely to detect  something interesting going on. On the other hand, everything comes with a cost. If the type II error is low, then we will  inevitably reject the null hypothesis based on some observations that indeed originate  from pure randomness. This is an error that's called a type I error. The type I error is the  mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis H0 while H0 is indeed true. Does this definition  ring a bell? When you choose a significance level α, you are choosing your highest acceptable type I  error rate. As you can imagine, the type I error and type II error will compensate for each other   in most cases. We will come back to this topic again and again when we talk about  machine learning.  Examples of type I and type II errors A classic example of type I and type II errors has to do with radar detection.  Say that a radar system is reporting no incoming enemy aircraft: the null  hypothesis is that there are no incoming enemy aircraft and the alternative  hypothesis is that there actually are incoming enemy aircraft. A type I error is  reporting the enemy aircraft when there are no aircraft in the area. A type II  error would be when there are indeed incoming enemy aircraft, but none   were reported.   180     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  In the next section, we are going to use the SciPy library to apply what we have learned so  far to various kinds of hypothesis testing problems. You will be amazed at how much you  can do.  Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing  The previous section went over a t-test and the basic concepts in general hypothesis  testing. In this section, we are going to fully embrace the powerful idea of the paradigm of  hypothesis testing and use the SciPy library to solve various hypothesis testing problems.  The paradigm  The powerful idea behind the hypothesis testing paradigm is that if you know that your  assumption when hypothesis testing is  roughly  satisfied, you can just invoke a well- written function and examine the P-value to interpret the results.   Tip I encourage you to understand why a test statistic is built in a specific way  and why it follows a specific distribution. For example, for the t-distribution,  you should understand what the DOF is. However, this will require a deeper  understanding of mathematical statistics. If you just want to use hypothesis  testing to gain insights, knowing the paradigm is enough.   If you want to apply hypothesis testing to your dataset, follow this paradigm:  1.   Identify the problems you are interested in exploring. What are you going to test?   A difference, correlation, or independence?  2.  Find the correct hypothesis test and assumption. Examine whether the assumption   is satisfied carefully.   3.  Choose a significance level and perform the hypothesis test with a software package.  Recall that in the previous section, we did this part manually, but now it is all left to  the software.  In this section, I will follow the paradigm and do three different examples in SciPy.   Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      181  T-test First, I will redo the t-test with SciPy. The default API for a single sample t-test from scipy.stats only provides for  two-tailed tests. We have already seen an example of interpreting and connecting  two-tailed and one-tailed significance levels, so this isn't an issue anymore.  The function we are going to use is called scipy.stats.ttest_1samp. The following  code snippet applies this function to our math score data:  from scipy import stats stats.ttest_1samp math2020,75.0   The result reads as follows:  Ttest_1sampResult statistic=-12.668347669098846,  pvalue=5.842470780196407e-34   The first value, statistic, is the t-statistic, which agrees with our calculation. The  second term is the P-value; it is so small that if the null hypothesis is true and you drew  a 900-student sample every second, it would take longer than the amount of time the  universe has existed for you to observe a sample as rare as we have here. Let's do a two-sample t-test. The two-sample t-test will test whether the means of two  samples are the same. For a two-sample test, the significance level is two-tailed as our   hypothesis is 𝐻𝐻0:μ1=μ2 .  There are two cases for the two-sample t-test, depending on the variance in each sample.   If the two variances are the same, it is called a standard independent two-sample t-test;   if the variances are unequal, the test is called Welch's t-test.  Let's first examine the standard t-test. The following code snippet generates and plots  two normally distributed samples: one at mean 2, and another at 2.1, with an equal  population variance of 1:  np.random.seed 2020  sample1 = np.random.normal 2,1,400  sample2 = np.random.normal 2.1,1,400  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.hist sample1,bins=np.linspace -1,5,10 ,alpha=0.5,label="sa mple1"    182     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  plt.hist sample2,bins=np.linspace -1,5,10 ,alpha=0.5,label="sa mple2"  plt.legend  ;  The result looks as follows:  Let's call the ttest_ind t-test function directly with the following line of code:  Figure 7.11 – Two samples with unequal means  stats.ttest_ind sample1,sample2   The result looks as follows:  Ttest_indResult statistic=-1.7765855804956159,  pvalue=0.07601736167057595   Our t-statistic is about -1.8. If our significance level is set to 0.05, we will fail to reject our  null hypothesis. How about increasing the number of samples? Will it help? Intuitively, we know that more  data contains more information about the population; therefore, it is expected that we'll  see a smaller P-value. The following code snippet does the job:  np.random.seed 2020  sample1 = np.random.normal 2,1,900  sample2 = np.random.normal 2.1,1,900  stats.ttest_ind sample1,sample2    Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      183   The result shows a smaller P-value:  Ttest_indResult statistic=-3.211755683955914,  pvalue=0.0013425868478419776   Note that P-values can vary significantly from sample to sample. In the following code  snippet, I sampled the two distributions and conducted the two-sample t-test 100 times:  np.random.seed 2020  p_values = [] for _ in range 100 :     sample1 = np.random.normal 2,1,900      sample2 = np.random.normal 2.1,1,900      p_values.append stats.ttest_ind sample1,sample2 [1]    Let's see how the P-value itself distributes in a boxplot:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.boxplot p_values ;  The boxplot of the P-values will look as follows:  Figure 7.12 – A boxplot of P-values for 100 standard two-sample t-tests   The majority of the P-values do fall into the region of [0, 0.2], but there are a handful of  outliers as well.   184     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  Next, if you don't know whether the two samples have the same variance, you can use  Welch's t-test. First, let's use the following code snippet to generate two samples from   two different uniform distributions with different sample sizes as well:  Note Our null hypothesis remains unchanged, which means that the two-sample  means are the same.  np.random.seed 2020  sample1 = np.random.uniform 2,10,400  sample2 = np.random.uniform 1,12,900  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.hist sample1,bins=np. linspace 0,15,20 ,alpha=0.5,label="sample1"  plt.hist sample2,bins=np. linspace 0,15,20 ,alpha=0.5,label="sample2"  plt.legend  ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.13 – Two uniformly distributed samples with different means, variances, and sample sizes Let's call the same SciPy function, but this time, we'll tell it that the variances are not  equal by setting the equal_var parameter to False:  stats.ttest_ind sample1,sample2,equal_var=False    Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      185  The result shows quite a small P-value:  Ttest_indResult statistic=-3.1364786834852163,  pvalue=0.0017579405400172416   With a significance level of 0.01, we will have enough confidence to reject the null  hypothesis. You don't have to know what Welch's t-statistic distributes; this is the   gift that the Python community gives to you.  The normality hypothesis test Our next test is a normality test. In a normality test, the null hypothesis H0 is that the  sample comes from a normal distribution. The alternative hypothesis H1 is that the sample  doesn't come from a normal distribution. There are several ways to do normality tests  not a hypothesis test . You can visually  examine the data's histogram plot or check its boxplot or Q-Q plot. However, we will   refer to the statisticians' toolsets in this section.  A note on Q-Q plots Q-Q plots are not covered in this book. They are used to compare two  distributions. You can plot data from a distribution against data from an ideal  normal distribution and compare distributions.   There are several major tests for normality. The most important ones are the Shapiro- Wilk test and the Anderson-Darling test. Again, we won't have time or space to go over  the mathematical foundation of either test; all we need to do is check their assumptions  and call the right function in a given scenario. How large should a random sample be to suit a normality test? As you may have guessed,  if the size of the sample is small, it really doesn't make much sense to say whether it  comes from a normal distribution or not. The extreme case is the sample size being 1. It  is possible that it comes from any distribution. There is no exact rule on how big is big  enough. The literature mentions that 50 is a good threshold beyond which the normality  test is applicable. I will first generate a set of data from Chi-squared distributions with different parameters  and use the two tests from SciPy to obtain the P-values.    186     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  A note on Chi-square distributions The Chi-squared distribution or x2 distribution is a very important  distribution in statistics. The sum of the square of k independent standard  normal random variables follows a Chi-squared distribution with a DOF of k.  The following code snippet plots the real PDFs of Chi-squared distributions, so that you  get an idea about the DOF's influence over the shape of the PDF:  from scipy.stats import chi2 plt.figure figsize= 10,6   DOFs = [4,8,16,32] linestyles= [":","--","-.","-"] for i, df in enumerate DOFs :     x = np.linspace chi2.ppf 0.01, df ,chi2.ppf 0.99, df , 100      rv = chi2 df      plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=4,               label= "DOF = " +  str df ,linestyle=linestyles[i] ; plt.legend  ;  The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.14 – Chi-squared distributions with different DOFs  Next, let's generate two sets of data of sample size 400 and plot them:  np.random.seed 2020  sample1= np.random.chisquare 8,400  sample2 = np.random.chisquare 32,400  plt.figure figsize= 10,6     Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      187  plt.hist sample1,bins=np. linspace 0,60,20 ,alpha=0.5,label="sample1"  plt.hist sample2,bins=np. linspace 0,60,20 ,alpha=0.5,label="sample2"  plt.legend  ;  The histogram plot looks as follows. Sample one has a DOF of 8 while sample two has a  DOF of 32:     Figure 7.15 – The Chi-squared distributions with different DOFs  Now, let's call the shapiro   and anderson   test functions in SciPy.Stats   to test the normality. The following code snippet prints out the results. The   anderson   function can be used to test fitness to other distributions but defaults   to a normal distribution:  print "Results for Shapiro-Wilk Test: "  print "Sample 1:", shapiro sample1   print "Sample 2:", shapiro sample2   print   print "Results for Anderson-Darling Test:"  print "Sample 1:", anderson sample1   print "Sample 2:", anderson sample2    The results for the Shapiro-Wilk test read as follows:  Sample 1:  0.9361660480499268, 4.538336286635802e-12  Sample 2:  0.9820653796195984, 7.246905443025753e-05    188     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The results for the Anderson-Darling Test read as follows:  Sample 1: AndersonResult statistic=6.007815329566711,  critical_values=array [0.57 , 0.65 , 0.779, 0.909, 1.081] ,  significance_level=array [15. , 10. ,  5. ,  2.5,  1. ]   Sample 2: AndersonResult statistic=1.8332323421475962,  critical_values=array [0.57 , 0.65 , 0.779, 0.909, 1.081] ,  significance_level=array [15. , 10. ,  5. ,  2.5,  1. ]    The results for Shapiro-Wilk follow the format of  statistic, P-value , so it is easy to see  that for both sample one and sample two, the null hypothesis should be rejected. The results for the Anderson-Darling test gives the statistic, but you need to determine   the corresponding critical value. The significance level list is in percentages, so 1 means  1%. The corresponding critical value is 1.081. For both cases, the statistic is larger than   the critical value, which also leads to rejection of the null hypothesis.  Different test statistics can't be compared directly For the same hypothesis test, if you choose a different test statistic, you cannot  compare the P-values from different methods directly. As you can see from the  preceding example, the Shapiro-Wilk test has a much smaller P-value than the  Anderson-Darling test for both samples.  Before moving on to the next test, let's generate a sample from a normal distribution and  test the normality. The following code snippet uses a sample from a standard normal  distribution with a sample size of 400:  sample3 = np.random.normal 0,1,400  print "Results for Shapiro-Wilk Test: "  print "Sample 3:", shapiro sample3   print   print "Results for Anderson-Darling Test:"  print "Sample 3:", anderson sample3    The results read as follows. Note that the function call may have a different output from  the provided Jupyter notebook, which is normal:  Results for Shapiro-Wilk Test:  Sample 3:  0.995371401309967, 0.2820892035961151   Results for Anderson-Darling Test:   Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      189  Sample 3: AndersonResult statistic=0.46812258253402206,  critical_values=array [0.57 , 0.65 , 0.779, 0.909, 1.081] ,  significance_level=array [15. , 10. ,  5. ,  2.5,  1. ]    It is true that we can't reject the null hypothesis even with a significance level as high as   α = 0.15.  The goodness-of-fit test In a normality test, we tested whether a sample comes from a continuous normal  distribution or not. It is a fitness test, which means we want to know how well our  observation agrees with a pre-selected distribution. Let's examine another goodness-of-fit test for a discrete case, the Chi-squared   goodness-of-fit test.  Suppose you go to a casino and encounter a new game. The new game involves drawing  cards from a deck of cards three times  the deck doesn't contain jokers . You will win the  game if two or three of the cards drawn belong to the suit of hearts; otherwise, you lose  your bet. You are a cautious gambler, so you sit there, watch, and count. After a whole day  of walking around the casino and memorizing, you observe the following results of card  draws. There are four cases in total. I've tabulated the outcomes here:  Figure 7.16 – Counting the number of hearts   Tip Note that in real life, casinos will not allow you to count cards like this. It is not  in their interests and you will most likely be asked to leave if you are caught.  First, let's calculate—given a 52-card deck where there are 13 hearts – what the expected  observation look like. For example, picking 2 hearts would mean picking 2 hearts from the 13 hearts of the deck   and pick 1 card from the remaining 39 cards, which yields a total number of 13!11!2! 39!38!1! .   So, the total combination of choosing 3 hearts out of 52 cards is 52!3!39! . Taking the ratio of   those two instances, we have the probability of obtaining 2 hearts being about 13.8%.    190     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The number of all observations is 1,023, so in a fair-game scenario, we should observe  roughly 1,023*13.80%, which gives 141 observations of 2 hearts cards being picked. Based on this calculation, you probably have enough evidence to question the casino  owner. The following code snippet calculates the fair-game probability and expected  observations. I used the comb function from the SciPy library:  from scipy.special import comb P = [comb 39,3-i *comb 13,i  comb 52,3  for i in range 4 ] expected = [1023*p for p in P] observed = [460,451,102,10]  The index in the P and expected arrays means the number of observed hearts. For  example, P[0] represents the probability of observing 0 hearts. Let's use a bar plot to see the differences between the expected values and the observed  values. The following code snippet plots the expected values and the observed values   back to back:  x = np.array [0,1,2,3]  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.bar x-0.2,expected,width=0.4,label="Expected"  plt.bar x+0.2,observed,width=0.4, label= "Observed"  plt.legend   plt.xticks ticks=[0,1,2,3] ;  The output of the code is as shown in the following graph:  Figure 7.17 – The expected number of hearts and the observed number of hearts   Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      191  We do see that it is somewhat more probable to get fewer hearts than other cards. Is this  result significant? Say we have a null hypothesis, H0, that the game is fair. How likely is it  that our observation is consistent with the null hypothesis? The Chi-square goodness-of- fit test answers this question.  Tip Chi-square and Chi-squared are often used interchangeably.    , where 0i is the number of   In this case, the x2 statistic is calculated as ∑ 𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖−𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 2 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖  4 𝑖𝑖  observations for category i, and Ei is the number of expected observations for category i.  We have four categories and the DOF for this x2 distribution is 4 – 1 = 3. Think about the expressive meaning of the summation. If the deviation from the  expectation and the observation is large, the corresponding term will also be large.   If the expectation is small, the ratio will become large, which puts more weight on the  small-expectation terms. Since the deviation for 2-heart and 3-heart cases is somewhat  large, we do expect that the statistic will be largely intuitive. The following code snippet calls the chisquare function in SciPy to test the goodness of  the fit:  from scipy.stats import chisquare chisquare observed,expected   The result reads as follows:  Power_divergenceResult statistic=14.777716323788255,  pvalue=0.002016803916729754   With a significance level of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis that the game can't be fair.   192     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The following PDF of the x2 distribution with a DOF of 3 can give you a visual idea of how  unfair the game is:  Figure 7.18 – A Chi-squared distribution with and DOF of 3  The code for generating the distribution is as follows:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   x = np.linspace chi2.ppf 0.001, 3 ,chi2.ppf 0.999, 3 , 100  rv = chi2 3  plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=4,           label= "DOF = " + str 3 ,linestyle="--" ;  Next, let's move on to the next topic: ANOVA.  A simple ANOVA model The ANOVA model is actually a collection of models. We will cover the basics of ANOVA  in this section. ANOVA was invented by British statistician R.A. Fisher. It is widely used to test the  statistical significance of the difference between means of two or more samples. In the  previous t-test, you saw the two-sample t-test, which is a generalized ANOVA test.    Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      193  Before moving on, let me clarify some terms. In ANOVA, you may often see the terms  factor, group, and treatment. Factor, group, and treatment basically mean the same  thing. For example, if you want to study the average income of four cities, then city is the  factor or group. It defines the criteria how you would love to classify your datasets. You  can also classify the data with the highest degree earned; therefore you can get another  factor group: degree. The term treatment originates from clinical trials, which have a  similar concept of factors and groups. You may also hear the word level. Level means the  realizations that a factor can be. For example, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and  New York are four levels for the factor group city. Some literature doesn't distinguish  between groups or levels when it is clear that there is only one facet to a whole dataset. When the total number of samples extends beyond two – let's say g groups, with group i  having ni data points – the null hypothesis can be formulated as follows:  𝐻𝐻0:μ1=μ2=⋯=μ𝑔𝑔   In general, you can do a sequence of t-tests to test each pair of samples. You will have  g g – 1  2 t-tests to do. For two different groups, group i and group j, you have the null   hypothesis 𝐻𝐻0:μ1=μ2=⋯=μ𝑔𝑔 . This approach has two problems:     You need to do more than one hypothesis test and the number of tests needed   doesn't scale well.      The results require additional analysis.  Now, let's examine the principles of ANOVA and see how it approaches these problems.   I will use the average income question as an example. The sample data is as follows:  Figure 7.19 – Income data samples from four cities  Assumptions for ANOVA ANOVA has three assumptions. The first assumption is that the data from each  group must be distributed normally. The second assumption is that samples  from each group must have the same variance. The third assumption is that  each sample should be randomly selected. In our example, I assume that these  three conditions are met. However, the imbalance of income does violate  normality in real life. Just to let you know.   194     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The ANOVA test relies on the fact that the summation of variances is decomposable. The  total variance of all the data can be partitioned into variance between groups and variance  within groups:  Now, we define the three terms. Let me use Xij to denote the j - th data point from   the j - th group, μ to denote the mean of the whole dataset  in our example, the mean of  all the income data from all four groups , and μi to denote the mean from group i. For  example, μ1 is the average income for people living in San Francisco:  VAR𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡=VAR𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑡𝑡𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏+VAR𝑏𝑏𝑤𝑤𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖   Here's that again but using notation common in the literature:  𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2=𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2+𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2   The total variance 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2  can be defined as follows: 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2=∑∑ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−μ 2 𝑖𝑖=1 𝑖𝑖=1 The variance within groups 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2   is defined as follows: 𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 𝑔𝑔 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2=∑∑ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−μi 2 𝑖𝑖=1 𝑖𝑖=1        The only difference is that the data point in each group now subtracts the group mean,  rather than the total mean. The variance between groups is defined as follows:  𝑔𝑔 𝑆𝑆𝐴𝐴2=∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 μ𝑖𝑖−μ 2 𝑖𝑖=1     The square of the difference between the group mean and the total mean is weighted by  the number of group members.  The reason why this partition holds comes from the fact that a data point Xij can be  decomposed as follows:  𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=μ+ μ𝑖𝑖−μ + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−μ𝑖𝑖     Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      195  The first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the total mean. The second term  is the difference of means across the group, and the third term is the difference within   the group. I encourage you to substitute this expression into the formula of 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2  and collect  terms to rediscover it as the sum of 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2  and 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2  . It is a good algebraic exercise.  The following code snippet does the calculation to verify the equation. First, I create the  following four numpy arrays:  SF = np.array [120000,110300,127800,68900,79040,208000,  159000,89000]  LA =  np.array [65700,88340,240000,190000,45080,25900,69000,120300]  BO =  np.array [87999,86340,98000,124000,113800,98000,108000,78080]  NY =  np.array [300000,62010,45000,130000,238000,56000,89000,123000]   Next, the following code snippet calculates 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2 , 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2 , and 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2  :  mu = np.mean np.concatenate  SF,LA,BO,NY    ST = np.sum  np.concatenate  SF,LA,BO,NY   - mu **2  SW = np.sum  SF-np.mean SF  **2  +np.sum  LA-np.mean LA  **2  +  \ np.sum  BO-np.mean BO  **2 + np.sum  NY-np.mean NY  **2  SB = 8* np.mean SF -mu **2 + 8* np.mean LA -mu **2 + \ 8* np.mean BO -mu **2 + 8* np.mean NY -mu **2  Now, let's verify that ST = SW + SB:  ST == SW+SB  The answer is True. So, indeed, we have this relationship.  How is this relationship useful? Let me first denote the variance for each group with   σ2  they are the same because this is one of the assumptions  and then check each   term carefully.   196     Statistical Hypothesis Testing      σ2~χ𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖−12  𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−μ𝑖𝑖 2 𝑖𝑖  of the squared differences is just a Chi-square distribution with a DOF of ni - 1:  The question is, what is the distribution of the statistic 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2σ2   ? Recall that for group i, the sum  When the null hypothesis holds, namely, μi = μj for arbitrary i and j, 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2𝜎𝜎2  is just the  summation of the statistic. Because each group is independent, we have 𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2σ2~χ𝑛𝑛−𝑔𝑔2 How about 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2𝜎𝜎2 ? When the null hypothesis holds, each observation, no matter which  group it comes from, can be treated as a realization of 𝑁𝑁 μ,σ2  ; therefore, 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2  will  𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2=𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2+𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2  , so 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2𝜎𝜎2  must follow an x2 distribution with a DOF of g - 1, where    g – 1 =  n – 1  –  n – g . The test statistic F is further defined as the ratio of the two equations, where σ2 is canceled:  follow a Chi-square distribution with a DOF of n - 1. However, we have the equation   n is the total number of the samples and g is the number of groups.   , where   The statistic F follows an F-distribution of F g – 1, n – g .  If the null hypothesis doesn't hold, the variance between groups 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2  will be large, so F will  be large. If the null hypothesis is true, 𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2  will be small, so F will also be small.  Let's manually calculate our test statistic for the income problem and compare it with the  functionality provided by SciPy. The following code snippet computes the F statistic:  F = SB  4-1   SW  4*8-4   F  The result is about 0.388. Before we do the F-test, let's also look at the PDF of the F-distribution. The following code  snippet plots the F-distribution with DOFs of 3 and 28:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   x = np.linspace f.ppf 0.001, 3, 28 ,f.ppf 0.999, 3, 28 , 100  rv = f dfn=3, dfd=28  plt.plot x, rv.pdf x , 'k-', lw=4,linestyle="--" ;  𝐹𝐹=𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2  𝑔𝑔−1  𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2  𝑛𝑛−𝑔𝑔     The plot looks as follows:  Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      197  Figure 7.20 – The F-distribution with DOFs of 3 and 28  You can estimate that such a small statistic, 0.388, will probably have a very large P-value.  Now, let's use the f_oneway   function from sciPy.stats to do the F-test. The  following code snippet gives us the statistic and the P-value:  from scipy.stats import f_oneway f_oneway LA,NY,SF,BO   Here is the result:  F_onewayResult statistic=0.38810442907126874,  pvalue=0.7624301696455358   The statistic agrees with our own calculation and the P-value suggests that we can't reject  the null hypothesis even at a very high significance value.  Beyond simple ANOVA After the F-test, when the means are different, various versions of ANOVA  can be used further to analyze the factors behind the difference and even their  interactions. But due to the limitations of space and time, we won't cover this.  Stationarity tests for time series In this section, we are going to discuss how to test the stationarity of an auto-regression  time series.  First, let's understand what a time series is.    198     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. A typical time series  is obtained by measuring the underlying quantities at equally spaced time intervals.  Examples include the opening value of a stock market index, the monthly GDP of a  country, or your weekly expenditure.  Time series data introduces an ordered structure into a dataset, which can lead to many  interesting problems. For example, a time series may have an upward or downward trend.  It may also have seasonal periodical behavior. For time series data such as stock market  data, stochastic behavior will introduce randomness. Finding correlations and forecasting  futures are key focuses of economists and financial analysts who work on economic or  financial time series. Now, let's understand what stationarity is. Some notation needs to be introduced. Suppose a time series {Xt} is generated from a  random process, which means for every timestamp t = 1, 2, 3, …, Xt is randomly sampled  from a probability distribution. In general, we don't know much about the relationship  between the distribution and time. The distribution itself may have a shifted value  inclusive of the expected value and variance, and so on. For a stationary time series, the following properties will be met:     The expectation E Xt  is independent of t.    The variance Var Xt  is also independent of t.    The covariance Cov Xt, Xt+k  only depends on the time index difference k. Let's look at a few examples of stationary and non-stationary time series in the   next subsection.  Examples of stationary and non-stationary time series Let's look at one stationary time series example first. The so-called white noise time   series is a simple classical stationary time series whose value at time t is given by the  following formula:  𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=ϵ𝑡𝑡 cid:3  Here, ϵ𝑡𝑡~𝑁𝑁 0,σ2  .   Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      199  A note on the name of white noise The name of white noise actually comes from white light. White light is a  mixture of lights of all colors. White noise is a mixture of sounds with different  frequencies. White noise is an important sound because the ideal white noise  will have equal power, or energy, throughout the frequency spectrum. Due to  the limitation of space, we won't go deep into this topic.  The following code snippet generates a white noise time series. You can verify that there is  no time dependence between Xt and Xt+k. The covariance is 0 for arbitrary k:  np.random.seed 2020  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   white_noise = [np.random.normal   for _ in range 100 ] plt.xlabel "Time step"  plt.ylabel "Value"  plt.plot white_noise ;  The results look as follows. You can see that it is stationary:  Figure 7.21 – The white noise time series  Another simple time series is random walk. It is defined as the addition of the previous   term in a sequence and a white noise term, ϵ𝑡𝑡~𝑁𝑁 0,σ2 .  You can define X0 to be a  constant or another white noise term:𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1+ϵ𝑡𝑡    200     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  Just as for white noise time series, the random walk time series has a consistent  expectation. However, the variance is different. Because of the addition of independent  normally distributed white noises, the variance will keep increasing:  Therefore, you have the variance expressed as follows:  𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=𝑋𝑋0+ϵ1+ϵ2+⋯+ϵ𝑡𝑡  𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 =∑𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉 ϵ𝑖𝑖  =𝑡𝑡σ2   𝑖𝑖  This is a little bit surprising, because you might have expected the white noises to cancel  each other out because they essentially symmetrical around 0. The white noises do cancel  each other out in the mean sense but not in the variance sense. The following code snippet uses the same set of random variables to show the differences  between white noise time series and random walk time series:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   np.random.seed 2020  white_noise = [np.random.normal   for _ in range 1000 ] random_walk = np.cumsum white_noise  plt.plot white_noise, label = "white noise"  plt.plot random_walk, label = "standard random walk"  plt.legend  ;  Here, I used the cumsum   function from numpy to calculate a cumulative sum of   a numpy array or list. The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.22 – Stationary white noise and non-stationary random walk   Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      201  Say you took the difference to define a new time series {δXt}:  δ𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡–𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1=ϵ𝑡𝑡   Then the new time series would become stationary. In general, a non-stationary time  series can be reduced to a stationary time series by  continuously  taking differences. Now, let's talk about the concept of autoregression. Autoregression describes the property of a model where future observations can be  predicted or modeled with earlier observations plus some noise. For example, the random  walk can be treated as a sequence of observations from a first-order autoregressive  process, as shown in the following equation:  The observation at timestamp t can be constructed from its one-step-back value Xt-1.  Generally, you can define an autoregressive time series with order n as follows, where  instances of Φi are real numbers:  𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1+ϵ𝑡𝑡   𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=ϕ1𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1+ϕ2𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−2+⋯+ϕ𝑛𝑛𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−𝑛𝑛+ϵ𝑡𝑡  𝑓𝑓 𝑠𝑠 =1−ϕ1𝑠𝑠−ϕ2𝑠𝑠2−⋯−ϕ𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑛𝑛=0   Without formal mathematical proof, I would like to show you the following results. The  autoregressive process given previously has a characteristic equation as follows:  In the domain of complex numbers, this equation will surely have n roots. Here is the  theorem about these roots:     If all the roots have an absolute value larger than 1, then the time series is stationary.  Let me show that to you with two examples. Our random walk model has the following characteristic function, f s  = 1 – s = 0, which  has a root equal to 0, so it is not stationary. How about the following modified random  walk? Let's see:  𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=0.8𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1+ϵ𝑡𝑡   It has a characteristic function of f s  = 1 – 0.8s = 0, which has a root of 1.25. By our  theorem, this time series should be stationary.   202     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The influence of X_{t-1} is reduced by a ratio of 0.8, and this effect will be  compounding and fading away. The following code snippet uses the exact same data we  have for white noise and random walk to demonstrate this fading behavior. I picked the  first 500 data points so linestyles can be distinguishable for different lines:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   np.random.seed 2020  white_noise = [np.random.normal   for _ in range 500 ] random_walk_modified = [white_noise[0]] for i in range 1,500 :     random_walk_modified.append random_walk_modified[-1]*0.8 \                                 + white_noise[i]  random_walk = np.cumsum white_noise  plt.plot white_noise, label = "white noise",linestyle=":"  plt.plot random_walk, label = "standard random walk"  plt.plot random_walk_modified, label = "modified random  walk",linestyle="-."  plt.legend  ;  The graph looks as follows:   Figure 7.23 – A comparison of a modified random walk and a standard random walk Let's try a more complicated example. Is the time series obeying the following the  autoregressive relationship?  𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡=0.6𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−1–1.2𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡−2+ϵ𝑡𝑡    Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      203  The characteristic equation reads 𝑓𝑓 𝑠𝑠 =1–0.6𝑠𝑠+1.2𝑠𝑠2 . It has two roots. Both roots   are complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts. The roots' absolute values are also  smaller than 1 on the complex plane. The following code snippet plots the two roots   on the complex plane. You can see that they are just inside the unit circle, as shown in  Figure 7.24:  for root in np.roots [1.2,-0.6,1] : plt.polar [0,np.angle root ],[0,abs root ],marker='o'   The graph looks as follows:  Figure 7.24 – A polar plot of roots inside a unit circle  You should expect the time series to be non-stationary because both roots have absolute  values smaller than 1. Let's take a look at it with the following code snippet:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   np.random.seed 2020  white_noise = [np.random.normal   for _ in range 200 ] series = [white_noise[0],white_noise[1]] for i in range 2,200 :     series.append series[i-1]*0.6-series[i-2]*1.2 + white_ noise[i]  plt.plot series, label = "oscillating"  plt.xlabel "Time step"  plt.ylabel "Value"  plt.legend  ;   204     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  The result looks as follows:  Figure 7.25 – A non-stationary second-order autoregressive time series example  Check the scales on the y-axis and you will be surprised. The oscillation seems to come  from nowhere. The exercise of visualizing this time series in the log scale is left to you as  an exercise. In most cases, given a time series, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller  ADF  unit root   test in the statsmodels library can be used to test whether a unit root is present or   not. The null hypothesis is that there exists a unit root, which means the time series is   not stationary.  The following code snippet applies the ADF unit root test on the white noise time series,  the random walk, and the modified random walk. You can leave the optional arguments   of this function as their defaults:  from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller adfuller white_noise   The result is as follows:   -13.456517599662801,  3.5984059677945306e-25,  0,  199,  {'1%': -3.4636447617687436,   '5%': -2.8761761179270766,   '10%': -2.57457158581854},  516.1905447452475    Using SciPy for common hypothesis testing      205  You need to focus on the first two highlighted values terms in the result, the statistic and  the P-value. The dictionary contains the significance levels. In this case, the P-value is very  small, and we can safely reject the null hypothesis. There is no unit root, so the time series  is stationary. For the random walk time series, the result of adfuller  random_walk_modified   is as follows:  The P-value is very large; therefore, we can't reject the null hypothesis: a unit root might  exist. The time series is not stationary. The result for the modified random walk is shown in the following code block. The  P-value is also very small. It is a stationary time series:   -1.4609492394159564,  0.5527332285592418,  0,  499,  {'1%': -3.4435228622952065,   '5%': -2.867349510566146,   '10%': -2.569864247011056},  1374.4481241324318    -7.700113158114325,  1.3463404483644221e-11,  0,  499,  {'1%': -3.4435228622952065,   '5%': -2.867349510566146,   '10%': -2.569864247011056},  1375.6034107373926   Forcefully applying a test is dangerous How about our wildly jumping time series? If you try to use the  adfuller   function on it, you will find a wild statistic and a P-value  of 0! The ADF test simply fails because the underlying assumptions are  violated. Because of the limitations of space and the complexity of it, I omitted  coverage of this. You are encouraged to explore the roots of the cause and the  mechanism of ADF tests from first principles by yourself.   206     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  We have covered enough hypothesis tests; it is time to move on to A B testing, where we  will introduce cool concepts such as randomization and blocking.  Appreciating A B testing with a real-world  example In the last section of this chapter, let's talk about A B testing. Unlike previous topics, A B  testing is a very general concept. A B testing is something of a geeky engineer's word for  statistical hypothesis testing. At the most basic level, it simply means a way of finding  out which setting or treatment performs better in a single-variable experiment. Most  A B testing can be classified as a simple Randomized Controlled Trial  RCT . What  randomized control means will be clear soon. Let's take a real-world example: a consulting company proposes a new working-hours  schedule for a factory, claiming that the new schedule will improve the workers' efficiency  as well as their satisfaction. The cost of abruptly shifting the working-hours schedule may  be big and the factory does not want the risk involved. Therefore, the consulting company  proposes an A B test. Consultants propose selecting two groups of workers, group A and  group B. These groups have controlled variables, such as worker's wages, occupations, and  so on, such that the two groups are as similar as possible in terms of those variables. The  only difference is that one group follows the old working-hours schedule and the other  group follows the new schedule. After a certain amount of time, the consultants measure  the efficiency and level of satisfaction through counting outputs, handing out quantitative  questionnaires, or taking other surveys. If you are preparing for a data scientist interview, the A B test you will likely encounter  would be about the users of your website, application, or product. For example, landing- page optimization is a typical A B test scenario. What kind of front page will increase  users' click rates and conversion? The content, the UI, the loading time, and many other  factors may influence users' behavior. Now that we have understood the importance of A B testing, let's dive into the details of  its steps.  Conducting an A B test To conduct an A B test, you should know the variables that fall into the following   three categories:     The metric: This is a dependent variable that you want to measure. In an   experiment, you can choose one or more such variables. In the previous example,  workers' efficiency is a metric.   Appreciating A B testing with a real-world example     207     The control variables: These are variables that you can control. A control variable   is independent. For example, the font and color scheme of a landing page are  controllable. You want to find out how such variables influence your metric.     Other factors: These are variables that may influence the metric, but you have no   direct control over them. For example, the wages of workers are not under your  control. The devices that users use to load your landing page are also not under  your control. However, wages surely influence the level of satisfaction of workers  and device screen sizes influence users' clicking behavior. Those factors must be  identified and handled properly.  Let's look at an experiment on landing page optimization. Let's say we want to find out  about the color scheme's influence on users' clicking behavior. We have two choices, a  warm color scheme and a cold color scheme. We also want group A to have the same size  as group B. Here is a short list of variables that will influence the users' clicking rate. You  are free to brainstorm more such variables:     The device the user is using – for example, mobile versus desktop    The time at which the user opens the landing page    The browser type and version – for example, Chrome versus Internet Explorer  IE     The battery level or Wi-Fi signal level  How do we deal with such variables? To understand their influence on users' click rates,  we need to first eliminate the influence of other factors so that if there is a difference in  click rates, we can confidently attribute the difference to the four variables we selected.  This is why we introduce randomization and blocking.  Randomization and blocking The most common way to eliminate or minimize the effect of unwanted variables is  through blocking and randomization. In a completely randomized experiment, the individual test case will be assigned a  treatment control variable value randomly. In the landing page scenario, this means that  regardless of the device, browser, or the time a user opens the page, a random choice of   a warm color scheme or a cold color scheme is made for the user.    208     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  Imagine the scenario that the number of participants of the experiment is very large; the  effect of those unwanted variables would diminish as the sample size approaches infinity.  This is true because in a completely randomized experiment, the larger the sample size is,  the smaller the effect that randomness has on our choices. When the sample size is large  enough, we expect the number of IE users who see the warm color scheme to be close to  the number of IE users who see the cold scheme.  The following computational experiment will give you a better idea of how randomization  works. I chose three variables in this computational experiment: device, browser, and  Wi-Fi signal. First, let's assume that 60% of the users use mobile, 90% of them use  Chrome, and 80% of them visit the website using a strong WiFi signal. We also assume  that there are no interactions among those variables; for instance, we do not assume that  Chrome users have a strong preference to stick to a strong WiFi connection. The following code snippet will assign a color scheme to a random combination of our  three variables:  def build_sample  :     device = "mobile" if np.random.random   < 0.6 else  "desktop"     browser = "chrome" if np.random.random   < 0.9 else "IE"     wifi = "strong" if np.random.random   < 0.8 else "weak"     scheme = "warm" if np.random.random   < 0.5 else "cold" return  device, browser, wifi, scheme   Let's first generate 100 sample points and sort the results by the number of appearances:  from collections import Counter results = [build_sample   for _ in range 100 ] counter = Counter results  for key in sorted counter, key = lambda x: counter[x] :     print key, counter[key]   The result looks as follows. You can see that some combinations don't show up:   'desktop', 'IE', 'strong', 'warm'  1  'mobile', 'IE', 'weak', 'cold'  1  'mobile', 'IE', 'strong', 'cold'  2  'mobile', 'chrome', 'weak', 'warm'  3  'mobile', 'chrome', 'weak', 'cold'  4  'desktop', 'chrome', 'weak', 'warm'  4   Appreciating A B testing with a real-world example     209   'desktop', 'chrome', 'weak', 'cold'  5  'desktop', 'IE', 'strong', 'cold'  6  'desktop', 'chrome', 'strong', 'warm'  10  'desktop', 'chrome', 'strong', 'cold'  19  'mobile', 'chrome', 'strong', 'warm'  20  'mobile', 'chrome', 'strong', 'cold'  25  If you check each pair with the same setting, for example, users who use the mobile  Chrome browser with strong WiFi signal, have a roughly 50-50% chance of getting the  cold or warm color scheme landing page. Let's try another 10,000 samples. The only change in the code snippet is changing 100 to  10000. The result looks like this:   'desktop', 'IE', 'weak', 'cold'  41  'desktop', 'IE', 'weak', 'warm'  45  'mobile', 'IE', 'weak', 'warm'  55  'mobile', 'IE', 'weak', 'cold'  66  'desktop', 'IE', 'strong', 'warm'  152  'desktop', 'IE', 'strong', 'cold'  189  'mobile', 'IE', 'strong', 'cold'  200  'mobile', 'IE', 'strong', 'warm'  228  'desktop', 'chrome', 'weak', 'cold'  359  'desktop', 'chrome', 'weak', 'warm'  370  'mobile', 'chrome', 'weak', 'cold'  511  'mobile', 'chrome', 'weak', 'warm'  578  'desktop', 'chrome', 'strong', 'warm'  1442  'desktop', 'chrome', 'strong', 'cold'  1489  'mobile', 'chrome', 'strong', 'warm'  2115  'mobile', 'chrome', 'strong', 'cold'  2160  Now, you see even with the two most unlikely combinations, we have about 30 to 40 data  points. There is  although we tried to mitigate it  an imbalance between the highlighted  two combinations; we have more cold scheme users than warm scheme users. This is the benefit that randomization brings to us. However, this usually comes at a high  cost. It is not easy to obtain such large data samples in most cases. There is also a risk that  if the warm color scheme or cold color scheme is very bad for the users' conversion rates,  such a large-scale A B test will be regrettable.    210     Statistical Hypothesis Testing  With a small sample size, issues of being unlucky can arise. For example, it is possible that  IE desktop users with weak WiFi signals are all assigned the warm color scheme. Given  how A B testing is done, there is no easy way to reverse such bad luck. Blocking, on the other hand, arranges samples into blocks according to the unwanted  variables first, then randomly assigns block members to different control variable values.  Let's look at the landing page optimization example. Instead of grouping users after  providing them with random color schemes, we group the users according to the device,  browser, or WiFi signal before making the decision as to which color scheme to show   to them.   Inside the block of desktop IE users, we can intervene such that, randomly, half of them  will see the warm color scheme and the other half will see the cold scheme. Since all the  unwanted variables are the same in each block, the effect of the unwanted variables will be  limited, or homogeneous. Further comparisons can also be done across blocks, just like  for complete randomization. You may think of blocking as a kind of restricted randomization. We want to utilize the  benefit of randomization, but we don't want to fall into a trap such as a specific group of  candidates purely being associated with one control variable value. Another example is  that in a clinical trial, you don't want complete randomization to lead to all aged people  using a placebo, which may happen. You must force randomization somehow by grouping  candidates first.  Common test statistics So an A B test has given you some data – what's next? You can do the following, for   a start:     Use visualization to demonstrate differences. This is also called testing by   visualization. The deviation of the results can be obtained by running A B   tests for several rounds and calculating the variance.     Apply a statistical hypothesis test.  Many of the statistical hypothesis tests we have covered can be used. For example, we have  covered t-tests, a test for testing differences of means between two groups – it is indeed  one of the most important A B test statistics. When the sizes of group A and group B are  different or the variances are different, we can use Welch's t-test, which has the fewest  assumptions involved.   Appreciating A B testing with a real-world example     211  For the clicking behavior of users, Fisher's exact test is good to use. It is based on the  binomial distribution. I will provide you with an exercise on it in Chapter 13, Exercises  and Projects. For the work efficiency question we mentioned at the very beginning of this  section, ANOVA or a t-test can be used.  For a summary of when to use which hypothesis test, here is a good resource:   https:  www.scribbr.com statistics statistical-tests .  Tip Try to include both informative visualizations and statistical hypothesis tests in  your reports. This way, you have visual elements to show your results intuitively  as well as solid statistical analysis to justify your claims. Make sure you blend  them coherently to tell a complete story.  Common mistakes in A B tests In my opinion, several common mistakes can lead to misleading A B test data collection  or interpretations:     Firstly, a careless A B test may miss important hidden variables. For example, say  you want to randomly select users in the United States to do an A B test and you  decide to do the randomization by partitioning the names. For example, people  whose first name starts with the letters A-F are grouped into a group, those with  G-P go into another, and so on. What can go wrong? Although this choice seems to be OK, there are some pitfalls. For example, popular  American names have changed significantly throughout the years. The most popular  female names in the 1960s and 1970s are Lisa, Mary, and Jennifer. In the 2000s and  2010s, the most popular female names become Emily, Isabella, Emma, and Ava. You  may think that you are selecting random names, but you are actually introducing  biases to do with age. Also, different states have different popular names as well.     Another common mistake is making decisions too quickly. Different from academic   research, where rigorousness is above all, managers in the corporate world prefer  to jump to conclusions and move on to the next sales goals. If you only have half or  even one-third of the tested data available, you should hold on and wait until all the  data is collected.   212     Statistical Hypothesis Testing     The last mistake is focusing on too many metrics or control variables at the same  time. It is true that several metrics can depend on common control variables and  a metric can depend on several control variables. Introducing too many metrics  and control variables will include higher-order interactions and make the analysis  less robust with low confidence. If possible, you should avoid tracking too many  variables at the same time.  Higher-order interaction Higher-order interaction refers to the joint effect of three or more independent  variables on the dependent variable. For example, obesity, smoking, and high  blood pressure may contribute to heart issues much more severely if all three of  them happen together. When people refer to the main effect of something, they  often mean the effect of one independent variable, and the interaction effect  refers to the joint effect of two variables.  Let's summarize what we have learned in this chapter.  Summary This chapter was an intense one. Congratulations on finishing it! First, we covered the concept of the hypothesis, including the basic concepts of  hypotheses, such as the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, and the P-value.   I spent quite a bit of time going over example content to ensure that you understood   the concept of the P-value and significance levels correctly. Next, we looked at the paradigm of hypothesis testing and used corresponding library  functions to do testing on various scenarios. We also covered the ANOVA test and   testing on time series. Toward the end, we briefly covered A B testing. We demonstrated the idea with a classic  click rate example and also pointed out some common mistakes. One additional takeaway for this chapter is that in many cases, new knowledge is needed  to understand how a task is done in unfamiliar fields. For example, if you were not  familiar with time series before reading this chapter, now you should know how to use   the unit root test to test whether an autoregressive time series is stationary or not. Isn't   this amazing? In the next chapter, we will begin our analysis of regression models.   Section 3:   Statistics for  Machine Learning  Section 3 introduces two statistical learning categories: regression and classification.  Concepts in machine learning are introduced. Statistics with respect to learning models  are developed and examined. Methods such as boosting and bagging are explained. This section consists of the following chapters:     Chapter 8, Statistics for Regression    Chapter 9, Statistics for Classification    Chapter 10, Statistics for Tree-Based Methods    Chapter 11, Statistics for Ensemble Methods    8 Statistics for  Regression  In this chapter, we are going to cover one of the most important techniques—and likely  the most frequently used technique – in data science, which is regression. Regression, in layman's terms, is to build or find relationships between variables, features,  or any other entities. The word regression originates from the Latin regressus, which  means a return. Usually, in a regression problem, you have two kinds of variables:      Independent variables, also referred to as features or predictors     Dependent variables, also known as response variables or outcome variables   Our goal is to try to find a relationship between dependent and independent variables.  Note It is quite helpful to understand word origins or how the scientific community  chose a name for a concept. It may not help you understand the concept  directly, but it will help you memorize the concepts more vividly.   216     Statistics for Regression  Regression can be used to explain phenomena or to predict unknown values. In Chapter  7,  Statistical Hypothesis Testing, we saw examples in the Stationarity test for time series  section of time series data, to which regression models generally fit well. If you are  predicting the stock price of a company, you can use various independent variables such  as the fundamentals of the company and macro-economic indexes to do a regression  analysis against the stock price, then use the regression model you obtained to predict the  future stock price of that company if you assume the relationship you found will persist. Of course, such simple regression models were used decades ago and likely will not make  you rich. In this chapter, you are still going to learn a lot from those classical models,  which are the baselines of more sophisticated models. Understanding basic models will  grant you the intuition to understand more complicated ones.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:     Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content    Connecting the relationship between regression and estimators    Having hands-on experience with multivariate linear regression and collinearity   analysis     Learning regularization from logistic regression examples  In this chapter, we are going to use real financial data, so prepare to get your hands dirty!  Understanding a simple linear regression  model and its rich content Simple linear regression is the simplest regression model. You only have two variables:  one dependent variable, usually denoted by y, and an independent variable, usually  denoted by x. The relationship is linear, so the model only contains two parameters.   The relationship can be formulated with the following formula:  k is the slope and b is the intercept. Є is the noise term.   Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     217  Note Proportionality is different from linearity. Proportionality implies  linearity and it is a stronger requirement that b must be 0 in the formula.  Linearity, graphically, means that the relationship between two variables  can be represented as a straight, but strict mathematical requirement of  additivity and homogeneity. If a relationship  function f  is linear, then  for any input x1 and x2 and scaler k, we must have the following equations:   𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥1+𝑥𝑥2 =𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥1 +𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥2   and 𝑓𝑓 𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥1 =𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓 𝑥𝑥1  .  Here is the code snippet that utilizes the yfinance library to obtain Netflix's stock price  data between 2016 and 2018. You can use pip3 install yfinance to install the  library. If you are using Google Colab, use !pip3 install yfinance to run a shell  command. Pay attention to the ! symbol at the beginning. The following code snippet imports the libraries:  import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import random import yfinance as yf  The following code snippet creates a Ticker instance and retrieves the daily stock price  information. The Ticker is a symbol for the stock; Netflix's ticker is NFLX:  import yfinance as yf netflix = yf.Ticker "NFLX"  start = "2016-01-01" end = "2018-01-01" df = netflix.history interval="1d",start = start,end = end  df   218     Statistics for Regression  The result is a Pandas DataFrame, as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.1 – Historical data for Netflix stock in 2016 and 2017  The next step for our analysis is to get an idea of what the data looks like. The common  visualization for the two-variable relationship is a scatter plot. We are not particularly  interested in picking the open price or the close price of the stock. I will just pick the  opening price as the price we are going to run regression against the Date column.  Date is not a normal column as other columns, it is the index of the DataFrame. You can  use df.index to access it. When you convert a date to numerical values, Matplotlib may  throw a warning. You can use the following instructions to suppress the warning.  The following code snippet suppresses the warning and plots the data:  from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters register_matplotlib_converters   plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.scatter df.index, df["Open"] ;   Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     219  The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.2 – Scatter plot of Netflix stock price data  Note that there are some jumps in the stock prices, which may indicate stock price surges  driven by good news. Also, note that the graph scales will significantly change how you  perceive the data. You are welcome to change the figure size to  10,3  and you may be less  impressed by the performance of the stock price! For this time period, the stock price of Netflix seems to be linear with respect to time. We  shall investigate the relationship using our two-parameter simple linear regression model.  However, before that, we must do some transformation. The first transformation is to  convert a sequence of date objects, the DataFrame index, to a list of integers. I redefined  two variables, x and y, which represent the number of days since January 4, 2016, and the  opening stock price of that day.  The following code snippet creates two such variables. I first created a timedelta object  by subtracting the first element in the index, January 4, 2016, and then converted it to the  number of days:    x=  df.index - df.index[0] .days.to_numpy   y = df.Open.to_numpy     220     Statistics for Regression  Note If you checked the Netflix stock prices in the past 2 years, you would surely  agree with me that simple linear regression would be likely to fail. We will try  to use more sophisticated regression models in later chapters on such data.   Why don't we use standardization? The reason is that in simple linear regression, the slope  k and intercept b, when data is at its original scale, have meanings. For example, k is the  daily average stock price change. Adding one more day to variable x, the stock price will  change accordingly. Such meanings would be lost if we standardized the data.  Next, let's take a look at how to use the SciPy library to perform the simplest linear  regression based on least squared error minimization.  Least squared error linear regression and variance  decomposition Let's first run the scipy.stats.linregress   function to gain some intuition   and I will then explain linear regression from the perspective of ANOVA, specifically,   variance decomposition. The following code snippet runs the regression:  from scipy.stats import linregress linregress x,y   The result looks as follows:  LinregressResult slope=0.1621439447698934,  intercept=74.83816138860539, rvalue=0.9447803151619397,  pvalue=6.807230675594974e-245, stderr=0.002512657375708363   The result contains the slope and the intercept. It also contains an R-value, a P-value,  and a standard error. Based on our knowledge from Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis  Testing, even without knowing the underlined hypothesis test, such a small P-value  tells you that you can reject whatever the null hypothesis is. The R value is called the  correlation coefficient, whose squared value R2 is more well-known, the coefficient of  determination.     Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     221  There are two major things that the linregress   function offers:      A correlation coefficient is calculated to quantitatively present the relationship   between dependent and independent variables.     A hypothesis is conducted, and a P-value is calculated.  In this section, we focus on the calculation of the correlation coefficient and briefly talk  about the hypothesis testing at the end. Regression uses independent variables to explain dependent variables. In the most boring  case, if the stock price of Netflix is a horizontal line, no more explanation from the  independent variable is needed. The slope k can take value 0 and the intercept b can take  the value of the motionless stock price. If the relationship between the stock price and the  date is perfectly linear, then the independent variable fully explains the dependent   variable in a linear sense. What we want to explain quantitatively is the variance of the   dependent variable. np.var y *len y  calculates the sum of squares total  SST  of the stock prices. The  result is about 653922. The following code snippet adds the horizontal line that represents  the mean of the stock prices and the differences between stock prices and their mean as  vertical segments. This is equivalent to estimating the stock prices using the mean stock  price. This is the best we can do with the dependent variable only.  plt.figure figsize= 20,8   plt.scatter x, y  y_mean = np.mean y  plt.hlines y_mean, np.min x , np.max x ,color="r"  sst = 0 for x_, y_ in zip x,y :     plt.plot [x_,x_],[y_mean,y_],color="black",linestyle="-"      sst +=  y_ - y_mean **2 print sst   The total variance, intuitively, is the summed square of the differences between the stock  price of the mean following the following formula. You can verify that the SST variable is  indeed about 6,53,922:   ∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅ 2 𝑖𝑖      222     Statistics for Regression  As you may expect, the differences between the stock price and the mean are not  symmetrically distributed along time due to the increase in Netflix stock. The difference  has a name: residuals. The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.3 – Visualization of SST and residuals  If we have a known independent variable x – in our case, the number of days since the  first data point, we prefer a sloped line to estimate the stock price rather than the naïve  horizontal line now. Will the variance change? Can we decrease the summed square of  residuals? Regardless of the nature of the additional independent variable, we can first  approach this case from a pure error-minimizing perspective. I am going to rotate the line around the point  np.mean x ,np.mean y  . Let's say  now we have a slope of 0.10. The following code snippet re-calculates the variance and  re-plots the residuals. Note that I used the variable sse, sum of squared errors  SSE , to  denote the total squared errors as shown in the following example:  plt.figure figsize= 20,8   plt.scatter x, y  y_mean = np.mean y  x_mean = np.mean x  plt.plot [np.min x ,np.max x ],           [x_2_y 0.1,x_mean,y_mean,np.min x  ,x_2_y 0.1,x_ mean,y_mean,np.max x  ,],          color="r"  sse = 0 for x_, y_ in zip x,y :     y_on_line = x_2_y 0.1,x_mean,y_mean,x_    Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     223      plt.plot [x_,x_],[y_on_ line,y_],color="black",linestyle="-"      sse +=  y_on_line - y_ **2 print sse   The SSE is about 155964 – much smaller than the SST. Let's check the plot generated from  the preceding code snippet:  Figure 8.4 – Visualization of SSE and residuals  It is visually clear that the differences for the data points shrink in general. Is there   a minimal value for SSE with respect to the slope k? The following code snippet loops  through the slope from 0 to 0.3 and plots it against SSE:   y_mean = np.mean y  x_mean = np.mean x  slopes = np.linspace 0,0.3,20  sses = [0 for i in range len slopes  ] for x_, y_ in zip x,y :     for i in range len sses  :         y_on_line = x_2_y slopes[i],x_mean,y_mean,x_          sses[i] +=  y_on_line - y_ **2  plt.figure figsize= 20,8   plt.rc 'xtick',labelsize=18  plt.rc 'ytick',labelsize=18  plt.plot slopes,sses ;   224     Statistics for Regression  The result looks as shown in the following graph:  Figure 8.5 – Slope versus the SSE  This visualization demonstrates the exact idea of Least Square Error  LSE . When we  change the slope, the SSE changes, and at some point, it reaches its minimum. In linear  regression, the sum of the squared error is parabolic, which guarantees the existence of  such a unique minimum.  Note  The intercept is also an undetermined parameter. However, the intercept is  usually of less interest, because it is just a shift along the y axis, which doesn't  reflect how strongly the independent variable correlates with the dependent  variable.  The following code snippet considers the influence of the intercept. To find the minimum  with respect to the two parameters, we need a 3D plot. You are free to skip this code  snippet and it won't block you from learning further materials in this chapter.   Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     225  The following code snippet prepares the data for the visualization:  def cal_sse slope,intercept, x, y :     sse = 0     for x_, y_ in zip x,y :         y_on_line = x_2_y slope,0,intercept,x_          sse +=  y_on_line - y_ **2     return sse  slopes = np.linspace -1,1,20  intercepts = np.linspace -200,400,20  slopes, intercepts = np.meshgrid slopes,intercepts  sses = np.zeros intercepts.shape  for i in range sses.shape[0] :     for j in range sses.shape[1] :         sses[i][j] = cal_sse slopes[i][j],intercepts[i][j],x,y   The following code snippet plots the 3D surface, namely SSE versus slope and intercept:  from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D from matplotlib import cm fig = plt.figure figsize= 14,10   ax = fig.gca projection='3d'  ax.view_init 40, -30  ax.set_xlabel "slope"  ax.set_ylabel "intercept"  ax.set_zlabel "sse"  plt.rc 'xtick',labelsize=8  plt.rc 'ytick',labelsize=8  surf = ax.plot_surface slopes, intercepts, sses, cmap=cm. coolwarm,                        linewidth=0, antialiased=True  fig.colorbar surf, shrink=0.5, aspect=5   plt.show     226     Statistics for Regression  The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.6 – SSE as a function of slope and intercept  The combination of the optimal values of slope and intercept gives us the minimal SSE.  It is a good time to answer a natural question: how much of the variance in the  independent variable can be attributed to the independent variable? The answer is given   It can also be defined as shown in the following equation:  by the R2 value. It is defined as follows:𝑅𝑅2=𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆−𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝑅𝑅2=𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆       Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     227  where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆−𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆  is called the sum of squared regression or regression sum   of squares. Do a thought experiment with me: if R2 = 0, it means we have no error after  regression. All the changes of our dependent variable can be attributed to the change of  the independent variable, up to a proportionality coefficient k and a shift value b. This is  too good to be true in general and it is also the best that simple linear regression can do. The slope and intercept given by the linregress   function gives us an R2 value of  0.89 0.94472 . The verification of this value is left to you as an exercise. In the next section, we are going to learn about the limitations of R2.  The coefficient of determination R2 is a key indicator of the quality of the regression model. If SSR is large, it means we  captured enough information in the change of the dependent variable with the change of  the independent variable. If you have a very large R2 and your model is simple, the story  can end here. However, beyond simple linear regression, sometimes R2 can be misleading. Let's take  multivariable, polynomial regression as an example. Let's say we have two independent  variables, x1 and x2, and we are free to use variables such as x1 expected expression of the dependent variable y will look like the following:  2 as new predictors. The   𝑦𝑦=β+α11𝑥𝑥1 +α21𝑥𝑥2+α12𝑥𝑥12+⋯+α𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘   In the stock price example, you can pick an additional independent variable such as the  unemployment rate of the United States. Although there is little meaning in taking the  square of the number of days or the unemployment rate, nothing stops you from doing   it anyway.  Note In a simple linear model, you often see r2 rather than R2 to indicate the  coefficient of determination. r2 is only used in the context of simple   linear regression.  R2 will always increase when you add additional 𝛼𝛼𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘  terms. Given a dataset, R2   represents the power of explainability on this dataset. You can even regress the stock price  on your weight if you measure it daily during that time period, and you are going to find   a better R2. An increased R2 alone doesn't necessarily indicate a better model.    228     Statistics for Regression  A large R2 doesn't indicate any cause-effect relationship. For example, the change of  time doesn't drive the stock price of Netflix high as it is not the cause of change of the  dependent variable. This is a common logic fault and a large R2 just magnifies it in   many cases. It is always risky to conclude cause-effect relationships without   thorough experiments. R2 is very sensitive to a single data point. For example, I created a set of data to  demonstrate this point. The following code snippet does the job:  np.random.seed 2020  x = np.linspace 0,2,20  y = 3*x + np.random.normal size=len x   x_new = np.append x,np.array [0]   y_new = np.append y,np.array [10]   plt.scatter x,y  plt.scatter [0],[10]  linregress x_new,y_new   The plot looks as shown in the following figure. Pay attention to the one outlier at the   top left:  Figure 8.7 – Linear data with an outlier   Understanding a simple linear regression model and its rich content     229  The R2 value is less than 0.3. However, removing the outlier updates the R2 value to   around 0.88. A small R2 may indicate that you are using the wrong model in the first place. Take the  following as an example. Simple linear regression is not suitable to fit the parabolic data:  np.random.seed 2020  x = np.linspace 0,2,20  y = 4*x**2-8*x + np.random.normal scale=0.5,size=len x   plt.scatter x,y  linregress x,y    The R2 is less than 0.01. It is not correct to apply simple linear regression on such a dataset  where nonlinearity is obvious. You can see the failure of such a dataset where simple linear  regression is applied in the following figure. This is also why exploratory data analysis  should be carried out before building models. We discussed related techniques in Chapter  2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, and Chapter 3, Visualization with   Statistical Graphs.  Figure 8.8 – A dataset where simple linear regression will fail   230     Statistics for Regression Hypothesis testing Let's briefly talk about hypothesis testing in simple linear regression. The P-value in the  linregress function is a P-value for the t-test. The t-test is a two-tailed test with the  following null hypothesis:  A small P-value indicates that we have enough confidence to reject the null hypothesis.  The details of the calculation are cumbersome with matrix algebra therefore omitted.   Connecting the relationship between  regression and estimators Recall that in Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation, we studied an example where we used  Maximal Likelihood Estimation  MLE  to estimate the slope in a 0-intercept linear  equation, which was formulated in the following form:  𝐻𝐻0:𝑘𝑘=0   𝑌𝑌 = 𝑘𝑘 𝑋𝑋 + ϵ cid:3         Note on MLE Please review the MLE for modeling noise example in Chapter 6, Parametric  Estimation. It is an example with rich content.   Note, if we add another parameter b, the derivation is still legitimate:   In the example, we assumed the distribution of the noise Є was normal N 0, 1  and  showed that the log-likelihood takes the following form:  𝑖𝑖  𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔𝐿𝐿 𝑘𝑘 =∑𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔 𝑓𝑓 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘   logL k,b =∑log 𝑓𝑓 ϵ𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘,𝑏𝑏   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑘𝑘,𝑏𝑏  𝑑𝑑𝑘𝑘  i  − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 2   cid:3  2 0.5log 2π − 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑏𝑏 2 2  =∑ −0.5𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔 2𝜋𝜋  𝑖𝑖 =∑ −𝑖𝑖 =∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑏𝑏 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖         Taking the derivative with respective to k and b, respectively, we obtain:   Connecting the relationship between regression and estimators     231  We also obtain the following equation:  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑘𝑘,𝑏𝑏  𝑑𝑑𝑏𝑏  =∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖–𝑘𝑘 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖  𝑖𝑖     Note  The log-likelihood function only depends on each data point through    𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑏𝑏 2 , whose sum is exactly SSE. Maximizing the log-likelihood is   equivalent to minimizing the squared error.  Now, we have two unknowns  k and b  and two equations. We can solve it algebraically.  Indeed, we have already solved the problem graphically through the 3D visualization,   but it is nice to have an algebraic solution. We have the following formula for the   algebraic solution:  𝑘𝑘=∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅  𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅  𝑖𝑖∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅ 2 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑏𝑏=𝑦𝑦̅–𝑘𝑘𝑥𝑥̅      Now, let's calculate the slope and intercept for the Netflix data with this formula and check  them against the linregress results. The following code does the job:  x=  df.index - df.index[0] .days.to_numpy   y = df.Open.to_numpy   x_mean = np.mean x  y_mean = np.mean y  k = np.sum  x-x_mean * y-y_mean   np.sum  x-x_mean **2  b = y_mean - k * x_mean print k,b   The results are about 0.16214 and 74.838, which agree with the linregress results perfectly. A computational approach is not illuminating in the sense of mathematical intuition.  Next, let's try to understand simple linear regression from the estimation perspective.   232     Statistics for Regression Simple linear regression as an estimator At this moment, we have covered the simple linear regression model from several  perspectives. As you may notice, the following three perspectives can be unified now:    Simple linear regression is a process of decomposing the SST into SSR and SSE,   where the SSR is explained by an independent variable.     Simple linear regression is a pure error minimizing process that minimizes the   MSE. This is also called Ordinary Least Squares  OLS .     Simple linear regression is an estimation of unknown parameters under the   assumption that the noise is independently and normally distributed.  All three perspectives are correct. When you apply simple linear regression, you already  implicitly assume the noise in your dataset is normally distributed. This is likely true  because of CLT's universality.  Before moving on to multivariate linear regression, let me briefly talk about the  correlation coefficient R itself and the standard error in the linregress output. The expression of k can be decomposed into the following form:  where sx and sy are uncorrelated sample standard deviation. They are defined as shown  in the following equations:     and   𝑘𝑘=∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅  𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅  =𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥  𝑖𝑖∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅ 2 𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥=√1𝑁𝑁∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅   cid:3  𝑖𝑖 𝑠𝑠𝑦𝑦=√1𝑁𝑁∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅  𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅  𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅  𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥= 𝑖𝑖√∑ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖−𝑥𝑥̅ 2∑ 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖−𝑦𝑦̅ 2 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖        rxy is called the sample correlation coefficient. It is defined as shown in the following  equation:   Having hands-on experience with multivariate linear regression and collinearity analysis     233  You might have noticed that the expression does give you k. In the linear model, rxy  connects the standard deviations of dependent and independent variables. Due to an  inequality restriction, rxy can only take values between -1 and 1, and equality is reached  when x and y are perfectly correlated, negatively or positively. The square of rxy gives us R2.  rxy can be either positive or negative but R2 doesn't contain the directional information but  the strength of explanation.  The standard error is associated with the estimated value of k. Due to space limitations,  we can't go over the mathematics here. However, knowing that an estimator is also a  random variable with variance is enough to continue this chapter. A smaller variance of  estimator means it is more robust and stable. A corresponding concept is the efficiency of  an estimator. Two unbiased estimators may have different efficiencies. A more efficient  estimator has a smaller variance for all possible values of the estimated parameters. In  general, the variance can't be infinitely small. The so-called Cramér–Rao lower bound  restricts the minimal variance that could be achieved by an unbiased estimator.  Note I would like to suggest an interesting read on this cross-validated question,  which you will find here: https:  stats.stackexchange.com  questions 64195 how-do-i-calculate-the-variance- of-the-ols-estimator-beta-0-conditional-on   Having hands-on experience with multivariate  linear regression and collinearity analysis Simple linear regression is rarely useful because, in reality, many factors will contribute  to certain outcomes. We want to increase the complexity of our model to capture more  sophisticated one-to-many relationships. In this section, we'll study multivariate linear  regression and collinearity analysis. First, we want to add more terms into the equation as follows:  𝑦𝑦=𝑘𝑘1𝑥𝑥1+𝑘𝑘2𝑥𝑥2+⋯+𝑘𝑘𝑛𝑛𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛+ϵ   There is no non-linear term and there are independent variables that contribute to   the dependent variable collectively. For example, people's wages can be a dependent   variable and their age and number of employment years can be good explanatory  independent variables.   234     Statistics for Regression  Note on multiple regression and multivariate regression You may see interchangeable usage of multiple linear regression and  multivariate linear regression. Strictly speaking, they are different. Multiple  linear regression means that there are multiple independent variables while  multivariate linear regression means the response dependent variable is a  vector  multiple , which means you must do regression on each element of it.  I will be using an exam dataset for demonstration purposes in this section. The dataset is  provided in the official GitHub repository of this book. The following code snippet reads  the data:  import pandas as pd exam = pd.read_csv "exams.csv"  exam  Let's inspect the data:  Figure 8.9 – Exam data for multivariate linear regression   Having hands-on experience with multivariate linear regression and collinearity analysis     235  The dataset contains three in-semester exams  the independent variable  and one final  exam  the dependent variable . Let's first do some exploratory graphing. Here, I introduce a new kind of plot, a violin plot. It is like a boxplot, but it gives a better  idea of how the data is distributed inside the first and third quartiles. Don't hesitate to try  something new when you are learning with Python! First, we need to transform our exam DataFrame to the long format such that it only  contains two columns, the score column and the exam_name column. We covered a  similar example for the boxplot in Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment. Feel  free to review that part. The following code snippet does the transformation:  exam["index"] = exam.index exam_long = pd.melt exam,id_vars=["index"],value_vars = exam. columns[:-1] [["variable","value"]] exam_long.columns = ["exam_name","score"]  I will sample 10 rows with exam_long.sample 10  from the new DataFrame   for a peek:  Figure 8.10 – The exam DataFrame in long format  The following code snippet displays the violin plot. You will see why it is called   a violin plot:  import seaborn as sns sns.set style="whitegrid"  plt.figure figsize= 8,6   sns.violinplot x="exam_name", y="score", data=exam_long ;   236     Statistics for Regression  The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.11 – Violin plot of the exam scores  We see that the score distributions are somewhat alike for the first three exams, whereas  the final exam has a longer tail. Next, let's do a set of scatter plots for pairs of exams with the following code snippet:  fig, ax = plt.subplots 1,3,figsize= 12,6   ax[0].scatter exam.EXAM1,exam.FINAL,color="green"  ax[1].scatter exam.EXAM2,exam.FINAL,color="red"  ax[2].scatter exam.EXAM3,exam.FINAL  ax[0].set_xlabel "Exam 1 score"  ax[1].set_xlabel "Exam 2 score"  ax[2].set_xlabel "Exam 3 score"  ax[0].set_ylabel "Final exam score" ;   Having hands-on experience with multivariate linear regression and collinearity analysis     237  The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.12 – Final exams versus the other three exams  The linear model seems to be a great choice for our dataset because, visually, the  numbered exam scores are strongly, linearly correlated with the final exam score.  From simple linear regression to multivariate regression, the idea is the same: we would  like to minimize the sum of squared errors. Let me use the statsmodels library to run  ordinary least square  OLS  regression. The following code snippet does the job:  import statsmodels.api as sm X = exam[["EXAM1","EXAM2","EXAM3"]].to_numpy   X = sm.add_constant X  y = exam["FINAL"].to_numpy   sm.OLS y,X .fit  .summary    The result looks as shown in the following figures. Although there is a lot of information  here, we will be covering only the essential parts.    238     Statistics for Regression  First, the regression result, or summary, is listed in the following figure:  Figure 8.13 – OLS regression result  Secondly, the characteristics of the dataset and the model are also provided in the  following figure:  Figure 8.14 – OLS model characterization  Lastly, the coefficients and statistics for each predictor feature  the numbered exam scores   are provided in the following table:  Figure 8.15 – Coefficients and statistics for each predictor feature  First, R2 is close to 1, which is a good sign that the regression on independent variables  successfully captured almost all the variance of the dependent variable. Then we have an  adjusted R2. The adjusted R2 is defined as shown in the following equation:  𝑅𝑅𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎2 =1− 1−𝑅𝑅2  𝑛𝑛−1  𝑛𝑛−𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑−1     Having hands-on experience with multivariate linear regression and collinearity analysis     239  df is the degree of freedom  here, it is 3 because we have 3 independent variables  and n is  the number of points in the data.   Note on the sign of adjusted R2 The adjusted R2 penalizes the performance when adding more independent  variables. The adjusted R2 can be negative if the original R2 is not large and you  try to add meaningless independent variables.  Collinearity The linear model we just built seems to be good, but the warning message says that there  are multicollinearity issues. From the scatter plot, we see that the final exam score seems  to be predictable from either of the exams. Let's check the correlation coefficients between  the exams:  exam[["EXAM1","EXAM2","EXAM3"]].corr    The result looks as shown in the following figure:  Figure 8.16 – Correlation between numbered exams  EXAM 1 and EXAM 2 have a correlation coefficient of more than 0.90 and the smallest  coefficient is around 0.85!  Strong collinearity between independent variables becomes a problem because it tends to  inflate the variance of the estimated regression coefficient. This will become clearer if we  just regress the final score on EXAM 1:  linregress exam.EXAM1, exam.FINAL   The result is as follows:  LinregressResult slope=1.8524548489068682,  intercept=15.621968742401123, rvalue=0.9460708318102032,  pvalue=9.543660489160869e-13, stderr=0.13226692073027208    240     Statistics for Regression  Note that with a slightly smaller R2 value, the standard error of the slope is less than 10%  of the estimated value. However, if you check the output for the three-independent- variables case, the standard error for the coefficients of EXAM 1 and EXAM 2 is about  one-third and one-fifth of the values, respectively. How so? An intuitive and vivid argument is that the model is confused about which independent  variable it should pick to attribute the variance to. The EXAM 1 score alone explains 94%  of the total variance and the EXAM 2 score can explain almost 93% of the total variance,  too. The model can either assign a more deterministic slope to either the EXAM 1 score or  EXAM 2, but when they exist simultaneously, the model is confused, which numerically  inflates the standard error of the regression coefficients. In some numerical algorithms where randomness plays a role, running the same program  twice might give different sets of coefficients. Sometimes the coefficient can even be  negative when you already know it should be a positive value. Are their quantitative ways to detect collinearity? There are two common methods.  They are listed here. The first one pre-examines variables and the second one checks the  Variance Inflation Factor  VIF :     You can check the correlation coefficient between pairs of independent variables as   we just did in the example. A large absolute value for the correlation coefficient is  usually a bad sign.     The second method of calculating the VIF is more systematic and unbiased   in general. To calculate the VIF of a coefficient, we run a regression against its  corresponding independent variable xi using the rest of the corresponding variables,  obtain the R^2 and calculate VIFi using the following equation:  𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖= 11−𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖2   Let's do an example. I will use the EXAM 2 score and the EXAM 3 score as dependent  variables and the EXAM 1 score as an independent variable:  X = exam[["EXAM2","EXAM3"]].to_numpy   X = sm.add_constant X  y = exam["EXAM1"].to_numpy   sm.OLS y,X .fit  .rsquared   The result is around 0.872. Therefore, the VIF is about 7.8. This is already a big value.   A VIF greater than 10 suggests serious collinearity.   Learning regularization from logistic regression examples     241  Is collinearity an issue? The answer is yes and no. It depends on our goals. If our goal is to  predict the independent variable as accurately as possible, then it is not an issue. However,  in most cases, we don't want to carry unnecessary complexity and redundancy in the  model. There are several ways to get rid of collinearity. Some of those are as follows:     Select independent variables and drop the rest. This may lose information.    Obtain more data. More data brings diversity into the model and will reduce    the variance.     Use Principle Component Analysis  PCA  to transform the independent variables  into fewer new variables. We will not cover it here because of space limitations. The  idea is to bundle the variance explainability of independent variables together, in a  new variable.     Use lasso regression. Lasso regression is regression with regularization of    L1- norm.   In the next section, we will see how it is done and what exactly L1-norm means.  Learning regularization from logistic  regression examples L-1 norm regularization, which penalizes the complexity of a model, is also called lasso  regularization. The basic idea of regularization in a linear model is that parameters in a  model can't be too large such that too many factors contribute to the predicted outcomes.  However, lasso does one more thing. It not only penalizes the magnitude but also the  parameters' existence. We will see how it works soon. The name lasso comes from least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. It will  shrink the values of parameters in a model. Because it uses the absolute value form, it also  helps with selecting explanatory variables. We will see how it works soon. Lasso regression is just like linear regression but instead of minimizing the sum of squared  errors, it minimizes the following function. The index i loops over all data points where j  loops over all coefficients:  ∑ y−𝑘𝑘𝑗𝑗𝑥𝑥1𝑖𝑖− 𝑘𝑘2𝑥𝑥2𝑖𝑖−⋯−𝑘𝑘𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 −β 2 i     +λ∑𝑘𝑘𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗     Unlike standard OLS, this function no longer has an intuitive graphic representation.   It is an objective function. An objective function is a term from optimization. We choose  input values to maximize or minimize the value of an objective function.    242     Statistics for Regression  The squared term on the left in the objective function is the OLS sum of squared error.  The term on the right is the regularization term. λ, a positive number, is called the  regularization coefficient. It controls the strength of the penalization. The regularization  term is artificial. For example, the regression coefficients slopes share the same coefficient,  but it is perfectly okay if you assign a different regularization coefficient to different  regression coefficients. When λ = 0, we get back OLS. As λ increases more and more, the coefficient will shrink  and eventually reach 0.   If you change the regularization term from 𝜆𝜆∑𝑘𝑘𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗    just like the OLS term, you   will get ridge regression. Ridge regression also helps control the complexity of a model,  but it doesn't help with selecting explanatory variables. We will compare the effects   with examples. We will run the lasso regression, ridge regression, and normal linear regression  again   with modules from the sklearn library.    to λ ∑kj2 j  Note It is a good habit to check the same function offered from different libraries  so you can compare them meaningfully. For example, in the sklearn  library, the objective function is defined such that the sum of squared error is   reduced by 12𝑛𝑛 . If you don't check the document and simply compare results   from your own calculation, you may end up with confusing conclusions about  regularization coefficient choice. This is also why in the code that follows, the  regularization coefficient for the ridge model multiplies 2n. The APIs for two  models are not consistent in the sklearn library.  The following code snippet prepares the data like earlier:  from sklearn import linear_model X = exam[["EXAM1","EXAM2","EXAM3"]].to_numpy   y = exam["FINAL"].to_numpy    In sklearn, the regularization coefficient is defined as α, so I am going to use α instead  of λ. First, I choose α to be 0.1:   alpha = 0.1 linear_regressor = linear_model.LinearRegression   linear_regressor.fit X,y  lasso_regressor = linear_model.Lasso alpha=alpha  lasso_regressor.fit X,y    Learning regularization from logistic regression examples     243  ridge_regressor = linear_model.Ridge alpha=alpha*len y *2  ridge_regressor.fit X,y  print "linear model coefficient: ", linear_regressor.coef_  print "lasso model coefficient: ", lasso_regressor.coef_  print "ridge model coefficient: ", ridge_regressor.coef_   The result reads as follows:  linear model coefficient:  [0.35593822 0.54251876 1.16744422] lasso model coefficient:  [0.35537305 0.54236992 1.16735218] ridge model coefficient:  [0.3609811  0.54233219 1.16116573]  Note that there isn't much difference in the values. Our regularization term is still too  small compared to the sum of squared error term.  Next, I will generate a set of data varying α. I will plot the scale of the three coefficients  with respect to increasing α:  linear_regressor = linear_model.LinearRegression   linear_regressor.fit X,y  linear_coefficient = np.array [linear_regressor.coef_] * 20 .T lasso_coefficient = [] ridge_coefficient = [] alphas = np.linspace 1,400,20  for alpha in alphas:     lasso_regressor = linear_model.Lasso alpha=alpha      lasso_regressor.fit X,y      ridge_regressor = linear_model.Ridge alpha=alpha*len y *2      ridge_regressor.fit X,y      lasso_coefficient.append lasso_regressor.coef_      ridge_coefficient.append ridge_regressor.coef_  lasso_coefficient = np.array lasso_coefficient .T ridge_coefficient = np.array ridge_coefficient .T      244     Statistics for Regression  Note that the .T method is very handy – it transposes a two-dimensional NumPy array.  The following code snippet plots all the coefficients against the regularization coefficient.  Note how I use the loc parameter to position the legends:  plt.figure figsize= 12,8   for i in range 3 :     plt.plot alphas, linear_coefficient[i], label = "linear  coefficient {}".format i ,               c="r", linestyle=":",linewidth=6      plt.plot alphas, lasso_coefficient[i], label = "lasso  coefficient {}".format i ,               c= "b",linestyle="--",linewidth=6      plt.plot alphas, ridge_coefficient[i], label = "ridge  coefficient {}".format i ,              c="g",linestyle="-.",linewidth=6  plt.legend loc= 0.7,0.5 ,fontsize=14  plt.xlabel "Alpha"  plt.ylabel "Coefficient magnitude" ;  The result looks as shown in the following figure. Note that different line styles indicate  different regression models.   Note Different colors  if you are reading a grayscale book, check the Jupyter  notebook  indicate different coefficients.  Figure 8.17 – Coefficient magnitudes versus the regularization coefficient   Learning regularization from logistic regression examples     245  Note that the dotted line doesn't change with respect to the regularization coefficient  because it is not regularized. The lasso regression coefficients and the ridge   regression coefficients start roughly at the same levels of their corresponding multiple   linear counterparts.  The ridge regression coefficients decrease toward roughly the same scale and reach about  0.2 when α = 400. The lasso regression coefficients, on the other hand, decrease to 0 one  by one around α = 250.  When the coefficient is smaller than 1, the squared value is smaller than the absolute  value. This is true to the fact that lasso regression coefficients decreasing to 0 doesn't  depend on this. You can do an experiment by multiplying all independent variables by 0.1  to amplify the coefficients, and you will find similar behavior. This is left to you as   an exercise. So, when α is large, why does lasso regression tend to penalize the number of coefficients  while ridge regression tends to drive coefficients at roughly the same magnitude? Let's do one last thought experiment to end this chapter. Consider the scenario that   we have two positive coefficients, k1 and k2, where k1 is larger than k2. Under the lasso  penalization, decreasing either coefficient by a small value δ will decrease the objective  function by δ. No secret there. However, in ridge regression, decreasing the larger value k1 will always decrease the  objective function more as shown in the following equation:  For k2, you can do the same calculation as the following:  Δ𝑘𝑘1=𝑘𝑘12– 𝑘𝑘1−δ 2=2𝑘𝑘1δ−δ2  Δ𝑘𝑘2=𝑘𝑘22– 𝑘𝑘2−𝛿𝛿 2=2𝑘𝑘2𝛿𝛿−𝛿𝛿2   Because k1 is greater than k2, decreasing the larger value benefits the minimization more.  The ridge regression discourages the elimination of smaller coefficients but prefers  decreasing larger coefficients. The lasso regression, on the other hand, is capable of  generating a sparse model with fewer coefficients. These regularizations, especially the  ridge regression, are particularly useful to handle multicollinearity. For readers interested in exploring this further, I recommend you check out the  corresponding chapter in the classical book Elements of Statistical Learning by Jerome H.  Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie.    246     Statistics for Regression Summary In this chapter, we thoroughly went through basic simple linear regression, demystified  some core concepts in linear regression, and inspected the linear regression model  from several perspectives. We also studied the problem of collinearity in multiple linear  regression and proposed solutions. At the end of the chapter, we covered two more  advanced and widely used regression models, lasso regression and ridge regression. The  concepts introduced in this chapter will be helpful for our future endeavors. In the next  chapter, we are going to study another important family of machine learning algorithms  and the statistics behind it: classification problems.   9 Statistics for  Classification  In the previous chapter, we covered regression problems where correlations, in the form   of a numerical relationship between independent variables and dependent variables,   are established.  Different from regression problems, classification problems aim to predict the categorical  dependent variable from independent variables. For example, with the same Netflix  stock price data and other potential data, we can build a model to use historical data that  predicts whether the stock price will rise or fall after a fixed amount of time. In this case,  the dependent variable is binary: rise or fall  let's ignore the possibility of having the same  value for simplicity . Therefore, this is a typical binary classification problem. We will look  at similar problems in this chapter. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works    Learning how to evaluate the performance of a classifier    Building a naïve Bayesian classification model from scratch    Learning the mechanisms of a support vector classifier    Applying cross-validation to avoid classification model overfitting  We have a lot of concepts and coding to cover. So, let's get started!    248     Statistics for Classification Understanding how a logistic regression  classifier works Although this section name sounds a bit unheard, it is correct. Logistic regression is  indeed a regression model, but it is mostly used for classification tasks. A classifier is a  model that contains sets of rules or formulas  sometimes millions or more  to perform   the classification task. In a simple logistic regression classifier, we only need one rule   built on a single feature to perform the classification. Logistic regression is very popular in both traditional statistics as well as machine learning. The name logistic originates from the name of the function used in logistic regression:  logistic function. Logistic regression is the Generalized Linear Model  GLM . The GLM  is not a single model, but an extended group of models of Ordinary Least Squares  OLS   models. Roughly speaking, the linear part of the model in GLM is similar to OLS, but  various kinds of transformation and interpretations are introduced, so GLM models can  be applied to problems that simple OLS models can't be used for directly. You will see  what this means in logistic regression in the following section.  The logistic function and the logit function It's easier to look at the logit function first because it has a more intuitive  physical meaning. The logit function has another name: the log-odds function,  which makes much more sense. The standard logit function takes the form   log  𝑝𝑝1−𝑝𝑝  , where p is between 0 and 1, indicating the probability of one  11+𝑒𝑒−𝑥𝑥 , where x   possibility happening in a binary outcome. The logistic function is the inverse of  the logit function. A standard logistic function takes the form   can take a value from -ꝏ to +ꝏ and the function takes a value between 0   and 1.  The task for this section is to predict whether a stock index such as SPX will rise or fall from  another index called the fear and greedy index. The fear and greedy index is an artificial  index that represents the sentiment of the stock market. When most people are greedy, the  index is high and the overall stock index is likely to rise. On the other hand, when most  people are fearful, the index is low and the stock index is likely to fall. There are various  kinds of fear and greedy indexes. The one composed by CNN Money is a 100-point scale  and contains influences from seven other economic and financial indicators. 50 represents  neutral, whereas larger values display the greediness of the market.    Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works     249  We are not going to use real data, though. Instead, I will use a set of artificial data as  shown in the following code snippet. As we did in Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing,  I will hide the generation of the data from you until the end of the section. The following  code snippet creates the scatter plot of the fear and greedy index and the stock index  change of the corresponding day:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change > 0],             stock_index_change[stock_index_change > 0],             s=200,             marker=6,             label="Up"  plt.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change < 0],             stock_index_change[stock_index_change < 0],             s=200,             marker=7,             label="Down"  plt.hlines 0,0,100,label="Neutral line"  plt.xlabel "Fear & Greedy Index",fontsize=20  plt.ylabel "Stock Index Change",fontsize=20  plt.legend ncol=3 ;   The graph looks as in the following figure:  Figure 9.1 – Fear and greedy index versus stock index change   250     Statistics for Classification  This might be suitable for simple linear regression, but this time, we are not interested  in the exact values of stock index change, but rather the direction of the market. The  horizontal neutral line bisects the data into two categories: the stock index either goes up  or goes down. Our goal is to predict whether a stock index will rise or fall given a fear and  greedy index value.  The formulation of a classification problem The goal of the classification task is to predict the binary outcome from a single numerical  independent variable. If we use the OLS model directly, the outcome of a classification is  binary but the normal OLS model offers continuous numerical outcomes. This problem leads to the core of logistic regression. Instead of predicting the probability,  we predict the odds. Instead of predicting the hard-cut binary outcome, we can predict the  probability of one of the outcomes. We can predict the probability that the stock index will  rise as p, therefore 1 – p becomes the probability that the stock price will fall, no matter  how small the scale is.  Notes on the term odds The odds of an event out of possible outcomes is the ratio of the event's  probability and the rest. You might have heard the phrase against all odds,  which means doing something when the odds of success are slim to none.  Although probability is limited to [0,1], the odds can take an arbitrary value  from 0 to infinity. By applying a shift to the odds, we get negative values to suit  our needs.  By running a regression against the odds, we have an intermediate dependent variable,  which is numerical and unbounded. However, there is one final question: How do we choose the parameter of the regression equation? We want to maximize our likelihood function. Given a set of parameters and  corresponding predicted probabilities, we want the predictions to maximize our  likelihood function. In our stock price example, it means the data points from the up  group have probabilities of being up that are as large as possible, and data points from  the down group have probabilities of being down that are as large as possible too. You  can review Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation, to refresh your memory of the maximal  likelihood estimator.   Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works     251  Implementing logistic regression from scratch Make sure you understand the chain of logic before we start from a regression line  to go over the process. Then, we talk about how to find the optimal values of this  regression line's parameters. Due to the limit of space, I will omit some code and  you can find them in this book's official GitHub repository: https:  github. com PacktPublishing Essential-Statistics-for-Non-STEM-Data- Analysts. The following is the step-by-step implementation and corresponding implementation   of logistic regression. We used our stock price prediction example. We start by predicting  the odds as a numerical outcome:  1.  First, l will draw a sloped line to be our first guess of the regression against the odds   of the stock index rising.   2.  Then, I will project the corresponding data points on this regressed line.  3.  Let's look at the results. The following graph has two y axes. The left axis represents   the odds value and the right axis represents the original stock index change. I  plotted one arrow to indicate how the projection is done. The smaller markers, as  shown in the following figure, are for the right axis and the large markers on the  inclined line indicate the regressed odds:  Figure 9.2 – Fear and greedy index versus odds  The regression parameters I chose are very simple—no intercept and only a slope  of 0.1. Notice that one of the up data points has smaller odds than one of the down  data points.   252     Statistics for Classification  4.  Now, we transform the odds into probability. This is where the logistic function   comes into play:  Probability=  1 1+𝑒𝑒−𝑘𝑘 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜   Note that the k parameter can be absorbed into the slope and intercept, so we still  have two parameters. However, since the odds are always positive, the probability   will only be larger than 12 . We need to apply a shift to the odds, whose value can    be observed into the parameter intercept. I apply an intercept of -5 and we get   the following:  Figure 9.3 – Fear and greedy index versus shifted odds  Note that the shifted values lose the meaning of the odds, because negative odds  don't make sense.  Next, we need to use the logistic function to transform the regressed shifted odds  into probability. The following code snippet defines a handy logistic function. You  may also see the name sigmoid function used in other materials, which is the same  thing. The word sigmoid means shaped like the character S. The following code  block defines the logistic   function:  def logistic x :   return 1    1 + np.exp -x    The following two code snippets plot the shifted odds and transformed probability  on the same graph. I also defined a new function called cal_shifted_odds for  clarity. We plot the odds with the first code snippet:  def cal_shifted_odds val, slope, intercept :     return val*slope + intercept   Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works     253  slope, intercept = 0.1, -5 fig, ax1 = plt.subplots figsize= 10,6     shifted_odds = cal_shifted_odds fg_index,slope,intercept   ax1.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change > 0],                          shifted_odds[stock_index_change > 0],                          s=200,                          marker=6,                         label = "Up"    ax1.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change < 0],             shifted_odds[stock_index_change < 0],             s=200,                marker=7,                         label = "Down"    ax1.plot fg_index, shifted_odds,          linewidth=2,          c="red"   The following code snippet continues to plot the probability:  ax2 = ax1.twinx     ax2.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change > 0],                          logistic shifted_odds [stock_index_change >  0],                         s=100,                          marker=6,                          label="Up"   ax2.scatter fg_index[stock_index_change < 0],                          logistic shifted_odds [stock_index_change <  0],                         s=100,                         marker=7,                          label="Down"     254     Statistics for Classification  ax2.plot fg_grids,           logistic cal_shifted_odds fg_ grids,slope,intercept  ,         linewidth=4,         linestyle=":",         c="green"   ax1.set_xlabel "Fear & Greedy Index",fontsize=20   ax1.set_ylabel "Odds - 5",fontsize=20   ax2.set_ylabel "Probability of Going Up",fontsize=20   plt.legend fontsize=20 ;  The result is a nice graph that shows the shifted odds and the transformed  probability side by side. The dotted line corresponds to the right axis; it has   an S shape and data points projected onto it are assigned probabilities:  Figure 9.4 – Transformed probability and shifted odds  5.  Now, you can pick a threshold of the probability to classify the data points. For   example, a natural choice is 0.5. Check out the following graph where I use circles to  mark out the up data points. I am going to call those points positive. The term comes  from clinical testing where clinical experiments are done:   Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works     255  Figure 9.5 – Threshold and positive data points  As you can see, there is a negative data point that was misclassified as a positive   data point, which means we misclassified a day that the stock index is going down  as a day that the stock index goes up. If you buy a stock index on that day, you are  going to lose money.  Positive and negative The term positive is relative, as it depends on the problem. In general, when  something interesting or significant happens, we call it positive. For example, if  radar detects an incoming airplane, it is a positive event; if you test positive for  a virus, it means you carry the virus.  Since our threshold is a linear line, we can't reach perfect classification. The  following classifier with threshold 0.8 gets the misclassified negative data point   right but won't fix the misclassified positive data point below it:  Figure 9.6 – Threshold = 0.8   256     Statistics for Classification  Which one is better? In this section, we have converted a regression model into a  classification model. However, we don't have the metrics to evaluate the performances   of different choices of threshold. In the next section, let's examine the performance of   the logistic regression classifier.  Evaluating the performance of the logistic   regression classifier In this section, we will approach the evaluation of our logistic regression classifiers in   two ways.  The first way is to use the so-called confusion matrix, and the second way is to use the F1  score. To introduce the F1 score, we also need to introduce several other metrics as well,  which will all be covered in this section. Let's see what a confusion matrix looks like and define some terms. For that, let's take an  example. The following table is a 2-by-2 confusion matrix for the threshold = 0.5 case:  The 2 in the top-left cell means that there are two positive cases that we successfully  classify as positive. Therefore, it is called True Positive  TP . Correspondingly, the 1 in   the bottom-left cell means that one positive case was misclassified as False Negative  FN .  We also have True Negative  TN  and False Positive  FP  by similar definition.  Note A perfect classifier will have false positive and false negative being 0. The false  positive error is also called a type 1 error and the false negative error is also  called a type 2 error. As an example, if a doctor is going to claim a man is  pregnant, it is a false positive error; if the doctor says a laboring woman is not  pregnant, it is a false negative error.  In addition, the recall  or sensitivity, or true positive  rate is defined as follows:  𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹    𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝐹𝐹𝑇𝑇   Understanding how a logistic regression classifier works     257  This means the ability of the classifier to correctly identify the positive ones from all the  ground truth-positive examples. In our stock index example, if we set the threshold to 0,  we reach a sensitivity of 1 because indeed we pick out all the positive ones. The all-positive classifier is n ot acceptable, though. On the other hand, the precision,   or positive predictive value, is defined as follows:  This means among all the claimed positive results, how many of them are indeed positive?  In our stock index example, setting the threshold to 1 will reach a precision of 1, because  there won't be any false positive if there are no positive predictions at all! A balance must be made. The F1 score is the balance; it is the harmonic mean of the   precision and recall. The harmonic mean of a and b is defined as 2𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎+𝑎𝑎 :  F1=2∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝∗𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝+𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟    Notes on the harmonic mean If two values are different, the harmonic mean is smaller than the geometric  mean, which is smaller than the most common arithmetic mean.  If we pick a threshold of 0.8, the confusion matrix will look as follows:  We can calculate the metrics for the preceding confusion matrix. Recall and precision are   both 23 =  22+1 . The F1 score is therefore also 23 . Then, the recall will still be 23 , but the precision will be 22 . We reach a higher F1 score, 0.8.   We obtained a better result by simply changing the threshold. However, changing the threshold doesn't change the logistic function. To evaluate  the model itself, we need to maximize the likelihood of our observation based on the  regressed model. Let's take a look at the regressed probabilities with code:  logistic cal_shifted_odds fg_index,slope,intercept      258     Statistics for Classification  The result looks as follows:  array [0.00669285, 0.04742587, 0.26894142, 0.73105858,  0.95257413,        0.99330715]   Here, I made the probabilities corresponding to positive data points bold. In this case, the  likelihood function can be defined as follows:  L slope,intercept = ∏ Pi ∏ 1−Pj      i=3,5,6  j=1,2,4  Here, index i loops through the positive indexes, and index j loops through the negative  indexes. Since we regress against the probabilities that the stock index will go up, we want   In practice, we often calculate the log likelihood. Summation is easier to handle than  multiplication numerically:  the negative data points' probabilities to be small, which gives us the form 1−𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗 . + ∑  𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙 1−𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗   𝑗𝑗=1,2,4  logL 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 = ∑ 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖    Let's calculate our log likelihood function for slope = 0.1 and intercept = -5 with the  following code snippet:  𝑖𝑖=3,5,6     np.prod probs[stock_index_change>0] *np.prod 1-probs[stock_ index_change<0]   The result is about 0.065. Let's try another set of parameters with the following code snippet:  probs = logistic cal_shifted_odds fg_index, slope=0.11,intercept=-5.5   np.prod probs[stock_index_change>0] *np.prod 1-probs[stock_ index_change<0]   The result is about 0.058. Our original choice set of parameters is actually better.    Building a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch     259  To find the parameters that maximize the likelihood function exactly, let's use the  sklearn library. The following code snippet fits a regressor on our data points:   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression regressor = LogisticRegression penalty="none",                               solver="newton-cg" .fit fg_index. reshape -1,1 ,                                      stock_index_change>0   print "slope: ",regressor.coef_[0][0]  print "intercept: ",regressor.intercept_[0]   The best possible slope and intercept are about 0.06 and -3.04, respectively. You can verify  that this is true by plotting the likelihood function value against a grid of slopes and  intercepts. I will leave the calculation to you as an exercise.  Note on the LogisticRegression    function Note that I explicitly set the penalty to "none" in the initialization of the  LogisticRegression instance. By default, sklearn will set an L2  penalty term and use another solver  a solver is a numerical algorithm to  find the maximum  that doesn't support the no-penalty setting. I have to  change these two arguments to make it match our approach in this section.  The newton-cg solver uses the Newton conjugate gradient algorithm. If  you are interested in finding out more about this, you can refer to a numerical  mathematics textbook. The last thing I would like you to pay attention to is the  reshaping of the input data to comply with the API.   Building a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch In this section, we will study one of the most classic and important classification  algorithms, the naïve Bayes classification. We covered Bayes' theorem in previous chapters  several times, but now is a good time to revisit its form. Suppose A and B are two random events; the following relationship holds as long   as P B  ≠ 0:  P 𝐴𝐴𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵      Some terminologies to review: P AB  is called the posterior probability as it is the  probability of event A after knowing the outcome of event B. P A , on another hand, is  called the prior probability because it contains no information about event B.   260     Statistics for Classification  Simply put, the idea of the Bayes classifier is to set the classification category variable as  our A and the features  there can be many of them  as our B. We predict the classification  results as posterior probabilities.  Then why the naïve Bayes classifier? The naïve Bayes classifier assumes that different  features are mutually independent, and Bayes' theorem can be applied to them  independently. This is a very strong assumption and likely incorrect. For example, to  predict whether someone has a risk of stroke or obesity problems, or predicting their  smoking habits and diet habits, are all valid. However, they are not independent. The   naïve Bayes classifier assumes they are independent. Surprisingly, the simplest setting  works well on many occasions, such as detecting spam emails.  Note Features can be discrete or continuous. We will only cover a discrete version  example. Continuous features can be naively assumed to have a Gaussian  distribution.   I created a set of sample data, as shown here, which you can find in the book's official  GitHub repository. Each row represents a set of information about a person. The weight  feature has three levels, the high_oil_diet feature also has three, and the smoking  feature has two levels. Our goal is to predict stroke_risk, which has three levels. The  following table shows the profile of 15 patients:  Figure 9.7 – Stroke risk data   Building a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch     261  According to Bayes' theorem, we have the following:  Let's start with the first feature, weight. Let's calculate P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠_𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑠𝑠  .  P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑠𝑠 =𝑃𝑃 𝑤𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑃𝑃 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒_𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   Let's calculate the prior probabilities first since they will be used again and again:     𝑃𝑃 𝑤𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑠𝑠  P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠_𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙 =815  P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠_𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=𝑚𝑚𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠 =315  P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠_𝑠𝑠𝑟𝑟𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖ℎ =415  P 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤 =515  P 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝑚𝑚𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤 =715  P 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡=ℎ𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ =315   For the weight feature, we have the following:  Now, let's find the 3-by-3 matrix of the conditional probability of P 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤𝑟𝑟𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠  . The  in the last row means that P 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑙𝑙𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤𝑟𝑟𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ =0 . If you count the table, you   column index is for the stroke risk and the row index is for the weight. The numbers in the  cells are the conditional probabilities. To understand the table with an example, the first 0   will find that among the four high-risk persons, none of them have a low weight:   262     Statistics for Classification  Let's do the same thing for the other two features:  The last one is for smoking, which is also binary:  OK, too many numbers; we will use Python to calculate them later in this chapter, but for  now, let's look at an example. What is the best stroke risk prediction if a person has middling weight, a high-oil diet, but no  smoking habit? We need to determine which of the following values is the highest. To simplify the  expression, I will use abbreviations to represent the quantities. For example, st stands   for stroke_risk and oil stands for a high-oil diet:  𝑃𝑃 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜   or 𝑃𝑃 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜   or 𝑃𝑃 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙=𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚,𝑙𝑙𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑙𝑙   =  P st=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ 𝑃𝑃 𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ    𝑃𝑃 𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜      the following:P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜    In the following example, I will use the high stroke risk case. With Bayes' theorem, we have   Here is an interesting discovery  To get comparable quantitative values, we only care about the numerator  because the denominator is the same for all classes. The numerator is nothing  but the joint probability of both the features and the category variable.   Building a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch     263  Next, we use the assumption of independent features to decompose the numerator,    We can further reduce the expression, as follows:   ≈𝑃𝑃 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ P 𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ    as follows: P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚,𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠,𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜  P 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ P 𝑤𝑤=𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ P 𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚=𝑦𝑦𝑚𝑚𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ P 𝑠𝑠𝑚𝑚=𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ    Thus, the comparison of poster distributions boils down to the comparison of the  preceding expression.  Note It is always necessary to check the rules with intuition, to check whether they  make sense. The preceding expression says that we should consider the prior  probability and the conditional probabilities of specific feature values.   Let's get some real numbers. For the stroke_risk = high case, the expression gives us the  following. The terms are in order. You can check the preceding tables to verify them:  The good habit of not smoking eliminates the possibility that this person has a high risk of  getting a stroke. How about stroke_risk = middle? The expression is as follows:  Note that this value is only meaningful when comparing it with other options since we  omitted the denominator in the posterior probability's expression earlier. How about stroke_risk = low? The expression is as follows:  415142404=0  715232323≈0.138  815482868=0.05    264     Statistics for Classification  The probabilities can therefore be normalized to a unit:  Therefore, according to our Bayes classifier, the person does not have a high risk of   getting a stroke but has a middle or low stroke risk with a ratio of 3 to 1 after normalizing  the probability. Next, let's write code to automate this. The following code snippet builds the required  prior probability for the category variable and the conditional probability for the features.  It takes a pandas DataFrame and corresponding column names as input:  def build_probabilities df,feature_columns:list, category_ variable:str : prior_probability = Counter df[category_variable]      conditional_probabilities = {}     for key in prior_probability:         conditional_probabilities[key] = {}         for feature in feature_columns:             feature_kinds = set np.unique df[feature]               feature_dict = Counter df[df[category_ variable]==key][feature]              for possible_feature in feature_kinds:                 if possible_feature not in feature_dict:                     feature_dict[possible_feature] = 0             total = sum feature_dict.values                for feature_level in feature_dict:                 feature_dict[feature_level]  = total             conditional_probabilities[key] [feature] = feature_ dict     return prior_probability, conditional_probabilities   Building a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch     265  Let's see what we get by calling this function on our stroke risk dataset with the following  code snippet:  prior_prob, conditional_prob= build_probabilities stroke_risk,                     feature_columns=["weight","high_oil_diet","smoking"],category_ variable="stroke_risk"   I used the pprint module to print the conditional probabilities, as shown:  from pprint import pprint pprint conditional_prob   The result is as follows:  {'high': {'high_oil_diet': Counter {'yes': 0.5, 'no': 0.5} ,           'smoking': Counter {'yes': 1.0, 'no': 0.0} ,           'weight': Counter {'high': 0.75, 'middle': 0.25,  'low': 0.0} },  'low': {'high_oil_diet': Counter {'no': 0.75, 'yes': 0.25} ,          'smoking': Counter {'no': 0.75, 'yes': 0.25} ,          'weight': Counter {'low': 0.5, 'middle': 0.5, 'high':  0.0} },  'middle': {'high_oil_diet': Counter {'yes':  0.6666666666666666,                                       'no':  0.3333333333333333} ,             'smoking': Counter {'no': 0.6666666666666666,                                 'yes': 0.3333333333333333} ,             'weight': Counter {'middle': 0.6666666666666666,                                'low': 0.3333333333333333,                                'high': 0.0} }}  I highlighted a number; the way to interpret 0.75 is by reading the dictionary keys as   the event we are conditioned on, and the event itself. You can verify that this does   agree with our previous table counting. It corresponds to the following conditional  probability expression:  𝑃𝑃 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑡𝑡=ℎ𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤_𝑠𝑠𝑤𝑤𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠=ℎ𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤ℎ     266     Statistics for Classification  Next, let's write another function to make the predictions displayed in the following   code block:  def predict prior_prob, conditional_prob, feature_values:dict :     probs = {}     total = sum prior_prob.values        for key in prior_prob:         probs[key] = prior_prob[key] total     for key in probs:         posterior_dict = conditional_prob[key]         for feature_name, feature_level in feature_values. items  :             probs[key] *= posterior_dict[feature_name][feature_ level]     total = sum probs.values        if  total == 0:         print "Undetermined!"      else:         for key in probs:             probs[key] = total         return probs  Note that it is totally possible that the probabilities are all 0 in the naïve Bayes classifier.  This is usually due to an ill-posed dataset or an insufficient dataset. I will show you a  couple of examples to demonstrate this:     The first example is as follows:  predict prior_prob,conditional_ prob,{"weight":"middle","high_oil_ diet":"no","smoking":"yes"}   The result is shown next, which indicates that the person is probably in the   low-risk group:  {'low': 0.5094339622641509,  'high': 0.33962264150943394,  'middle': 0.15094339622641506}   Underfitting, overfitting, and cross-validation     267     The second example is as follows:  predict prior_prob, conditional_ prob,{"weight":"high","high_oil_ diet":"no","smoking":"no"}   The result is undetermined! If you check the conditional probabilities, you will find that  the contradiction in the features and the insufficiency of the dataset lead to all zeros in the  posterior probabilities. This is left to you as an exercise. In the next section, let's look at another important concept in machine learning, especially  classification tasks: cross-validation.  Underfitting, overfitting, and cross-validation What is cross-validation and why is it needed? To talk about cross-validation, we must  formally introduce two other important concepts first: underfitting and overfitting.  In order to obtain a good model for either a regression problem or a classification  problem, we must fit the model with the data. The fitting process is usually referred   to as training. In the training process, the model captures characteristics of the data,  establishes numerical rules, and applies formulas or expressions.  Note The training process is used to establish a mapping between the data and the  output  classification, regression  we want. For example, when a baby learns  how to distinguish an apple and a lemon, they may learn how to associate the  colors of those fruits with the taste. Therefore, they will make the right decision  to grab a sweet red apple rather than a sour yellow lemon.  Everything we have discussed so far is about the training technique. On the other hand,  putting a model into a real job is called testing. Here is a little ambiguity that people often  use carelessly. In principle, we should have no expectation of the model's output on the  testing dataset, because that is the goal of the model: we need the model to predict or  generate results on the testing set.  However, you may also hear the term testing set in a training process! Here, the word  testing actually means an evaluation process of the trained model. Strictly speaking, a  testing set is reserved for testing after the model is built. In this case, a model is trained   on a training set, then applied on a so-called testing set, which we know the ground   truth is to get a benchmark of the model's performance. So, be aware of the two   meanings of testing.    268     Statistics for Classification  In the following content, I will refer to testing in the training process. For example, if the  baby we mentioned previously learned that red means sweetness, say one day the baby  sees a red pepper for the first time and thinks it is sweet – what will happen? The baby's  color-to-sweetness model will likely fail the testing on the testing set: a red pepper. What  the baby learned is an overfitted model.  An overfitted model learns too much about the characteristics of the training data – for  the baby, it is the apple – such that it cannot be generalized to unseen data easily. How about an underfitted model? An underfitted model can be constructed this way. If  the baby learns another feature that density is also a factor to indicate whether a fruit  vegetable is sweet or not, the baby may likely avoid the red pepper. Compared to this  model involving the fruit's density, the baby's simple color-only model is underfitting. An underfitted model doesn't learn enough from the training data. It can be improved to  perform better on the training data without potentially damaging its generalization capacity. As you may have guessed, overfitting and underfitting are two cases that may not have  clear boundaries. Here is a vivid example. Suppose we have the following data and we  would like to have a polynomial regression model to fit it. A polynomial regression model  uses a polynomial, rather than a linear line, to fit the data. The degree of the polynomial is  a parameter we should choose for the model. Let's see which one we should choose. The following code snippet plots the artificial data:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   x_coor = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] y_coor = [3,8,5,7,10,9,15] plt.scatter x_coor,y_coor ;   The result looks as follows:  Figure 9.8 – Artificial data for polynomial fitting   Underfitting, overfitting, and cross-validation     269  Now, let me use 1st-, 3rd-, and 5th-order polynomials to fit the data points. The two  functions I used are numpy.polyfit   and numpy.polyval  . The following   code snippet plots the graph:  styles=[":","--","-"] plt.figure figsize= 10,6   x = np.linspace 1,7,20  for idx, degree in enumerate range 1,6,2  :     coef = np.polyfit x_coor,y_coor,degree      y = np.polyval coef,x      plt.plot x,y,               linewidth=4,              linestyle=styles[idx],              label="degree {}".format str degree    plt.scatter x_coor,y_coor,             s=400,             label="Original Data",             marker="o" ; plt.legend  ;   The result looks as in the following figure. Note that I made the original data points  exceptionally large:  Figure 9.9 – Polynomial fitting of artificial data points   270     Statistics for Classification  Well, it looks like the high-degree fitting almost overlaps with every data point and the  linear regression line passes in between. However, with a degree of 5, the polynomial in  principle can fit any five points in the plane, and we merely have seven points. This is  clearly overfitting. Let's enlarge our vision a little bit. In the next figure, I slightly modified  the range of the x variable from [1,7] to [0,8]. Let's see what happens. The modification is  easy, so the code is omitted:  Figure 9.10 – Fitting polynomials in an extended range  Wow! See the penalty we pay to fit our training data? The higher-order polynomial   just goes wild! Imagine if we have a testing data point between 0 and 1; what a   counter-intuitive result we will get! The question is, how do we prevent overfitting? We have already seen one tool,  regularization. The other tool is called cross-validation. Cross-validating requires another dataset called the validation set to validate the model  before the model is applied to the testing set. Cross-validation can help to reduce the  overfitting and reduce bias in the model learned in the training set early on. For example,  the most common k-fold cross-validation splits the training set into k parts and leaves  one part out of the training set to be the validation set. After the training is done, that  validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The same procedure is  iterated k times. Bias can be detected early on if the model learned too much from   the limited training set.  Note Cross-validation can also be used to select parameters of the model.    Underfitting, overfitting, and cross-validation     271  Some sklearn classifiers have cross-validation built into the model classes. Since we   have reached the end of the chapter, let's look at a logistic regression cross-validation  example in sklearn. Here, I am going to use the stroke risk data for logistic regression  cross-validation. I am going to convert some categorical variables into numerical  variables. Recall that this is usually a bad practice, as we discussed in Chapter 1,  Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing.  However, it is doable here for a simple model such as logistic regression, because there  is an ordered structure in the categories. For example, I can map low weight to 1, middle  weight to 2, and high weight to 3. The logistic regression classifier will automatically learn  the parameters to distinguish them. Another point is that the target stroke risk will now  have three choices rather than two. This multi-class classification is also achievable by  training more than two logistic regression classifiers and using them together to partition  the outcome space. The code that does the category-to-numeric mapping is omitted due  to space limitation; you can find it in the Jupyter notebook. The code that invokes logistic  regression cross-validation reads as follows:  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV X = stroke_risk[["weight","high_oil_diet","smoking"]] y = stroke_risk["stroke_risk"] classifier = LogisticRegressionCV cv=3,random_state=2020,multi_ class="auto" .fit X,y   Note that the k-fold cross validation has a k value of 3. We shouldn't choose a k value  larger than the total number of records. If we choose 15, which is exactly the number   of records, it is called leave-one-out cross-validation. You can obtain some parameters of the cross-validated classifier by calling   classifier.get_params. The result reads as follows:  <bound method BaseEstimator.get_params of  LogisticRegressionCV Cs=10, class_weight=None, cv=3,  dual=False,                      fit_intercept=True, intercept_scaling=1.0,  l1_ratios=None,                      max_iter=100, multi_class='auto', n_ jobs=None,                      penalty='l2', random_state=2020,  refit=True, scoring=None,                      solver='lbfgs', tol=0.0001, verbose=0 >   272     Statistics for Classification  Note that a regularization term is automatically introduced because of the Cs parameter.  For more details, you can refer to the API of the function. Now, let's call the predict_prob   function to predict the probabilities. Let's say  the person is slightly overweight, so they have a weight value of 1.5. Recall that 1 means  middle and 2 means high for weight. This person also eats slightly more fatty foods but  smokes a lot. So, they have 0.5 and 2 on another two features, respectively. The code   reads as follows:  classifier.predict_proba np.array [[1.5,0.5,2]]    The results read as follows:  array [[0.20456731, 0.15382072, 0.64161197]]   So, this person likely falls into the high stroke risk group. Note that this model is very  coarse due to the categorical variable-to-numerical variable conversion, but it gives   you the capability to estimate on data, which is beyond the previous observations.   Summary In this chapter, we thoroughly studied the logistic regression classifier and corresponding  classification task concepts. Then, we built a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch. In the last  part of this chapter, we discussed the concepts of underfitting and overfitting, and used  sklearn to use cross-validation functions.  In the next chapter, we are going to study another big branch of machine learning models,  tree-based models.   10 Statistics for   Tree-Based Methods  In the previous chapter, we covered some important concepts in classification models. We  also built a naïve Bayes classifier from scratch, which is very important because it requires  you to understand every aspect of the details. In this chapter, we are going to dive into another family of statistical models that are   also widely used in statistical analysis as well as machine learning: tree-based models.  Tree-based models can be used for both classification tasks and regression tasks.  By the end of this chapter, you will have achieved the following:     Gained an overview of tree-based classification    Understood the details of classification tree building    Understood the mechanisms of regression trees    Know how to use the scikit-learn library to build and regularize a    tree-based method  Let's get started! All the code snippets used in this chapter can be found in the official  GitHub repository here: https:  github.com PacktPublishing Essential- Statistics-for-Non-STEM-Data-Analysts.   274     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods  Overviewing tree-based methods for  classification tasks Tree-based methods have two major varieties: classification trees and regression trees.  A classification tree predicts categorical outcomes from a finite set of possibilities, while  a regression tree predicts numerical outcomes. Let's first look at the classification tree,  especially the quality that makes it more popular and easy to use compared to other  classification methods, such as the simple logistic regression classifier and the naïve   Bayes classifier. A classification tree creates a set of rules and partitions the data into various subspaces in the  feature space  or feature domain  in an optimal way. First question, what is a feature space? Let's take our stroke risk data that we used in Chapter 9, Statistics for Classification,  as sample data. Here's the dataset from the previous chapter for your reference. Each  row is a profile for a patient that records their weight, diet habit, smoking habit, and  corresponding stroke risk level:  Figure 10.1 – Stroke risk data   Overviewing tree-based methods for classification tasks     275  We have three features for each record. If we only look at the weight feature, it can  take three different levels: low, middle, and high. Imagine, in a one-dimensional line  representing weight, that there are only three discrete points a value can take, namely the  three levels. This is a one-dimensional feature space or feature domain. On the other hand, high-oil diet and smoking habit are other two-feature dimensions   with two possibilities. Therefore, a person can be on one of 12  3*2*2  combinations   of all features in this three-dimensional feature space. A classification tree is built with rules to map these 12 points in the feature space to the  outcome space, which has three possible outcomes. Each rule is a yes-no question and the  answer will be non-ambiguous, so each data record has a certain path to go down the tree.  The following is an example of such a classification tree:  Figure 10.2 – An example of a classification tree for stroke risk data  Let's look at one example to better understand the tree. Suppose you are a guy who  smokes but doesn't have a high-oil diet. Then, starting at the top of the tree, you will first  go down to the left branch, and then go right to the Middle stroke risk box. The decision  tree classifies you as a patient with middle stroke risk. Now is a good time to introduce some terminology to mathematically describe a decision  tree, rather than using casual terms such as box. A tree is usually drawn upside down, but  this is a good thing as you follow down a chain of decisions to reach the final status. Here  is some few important terminology that you need to be aware of:     Root node: A root node is the only node block that only has outgoing arrows. In   the tree shown in the previous figure, it is the one at the top with the Smoking  text. The root node contains all the records, and they haven't been divided into  sub-categories, which corresponds to partitions of feature space.   276     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods      Decision node: A decision node is one node with both incoming and outgoing  arrows. It splits the data feed into two groups. For example, the two nodes on the  second level of the tree  High oil diet? and High weight?  are decision nodes. The  one on the left splits the smoking group further into the smoking and high-oil   diet group and the smoking and non-high-oil diet group. The one on the right  splits the non-smoking group further into the non-smoking and high weight and  non-smoking and non-high weight groups.      Leaf node: A leaf node or a leaf is a node with only incoming arrows. A leaf node  represents the final terminal of a classification process where no further splitting is  needed or allowed. For example, the node at the bottom left is a leaf that indicates  that people who smoke and have a high-oil diet are classified to have a high risk  of stroke. It is not necessary for a leaf to only contain pure results. In this case, it is  alright to have only low stroke risk and high stroke risk people in the leaf. What we  optimized is the pureness of the classes in the node as the goal of classification is to  reach unambiguous labeling. The label for the records in a leaf node is the majority  label. If there is a tie, a common solution is to pick a random label of the tied  candidates to make it the majority label.     Parent node and children nodes: The node at the start of an arrow is the parent   node of the nodes at the end of the arrows, which are called the child nodes. A node  can simultaneously be a parent node and a child node, except the root node and the  leaf. The process of determining which feature or criteria to use to generate children  nodes is called splitting. It is common practice to do binary splitting, which means   a parent node will have two child nodes.     Depth and pruning: The depth of a decision tree is defined as the length of the   chain from the root node to the furthest leaf. In the stroke risk case, the depth is 2. It  is not necessary for a decision tree to be balanced. One branch of the tree can have  more depth than another branch if accuracy requires. The operation of removing  children nodes, including grandchild nodes and more, is called pruning, just like  pruning a biological tree.  From now on, we will use the rigorous terms we just learned to describe a decision tree.  Note One of the benefits of a decision tree is its universality. The features don't  necessarily take discrete values; they can also take continuous numerical  values. For example, if weight is replaced with continuous numerical values, the  splitting on high weight or not will be replaced by a node with criteria such as  weight > 200 pounds?.   Overviewing tree-based methods for classification tasks     277  Now, let's go over the advantages of decision trees:      The biggest advantage of decision trees is that they are easy to understand. For a   person without any statistics or machine learning background, decision trees are   the easiest classification algorithms to understand.      The decision tree is not sensitive to data preprocessing and data incompletion. For  many machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing is vital. For example, the  units of a feature in grams or kilograms will influence the coefficient values of  logistic regression. However, decision trees are not sensitive to data preprocessing.  The selection of the criteria will adjust automatically when the scale of the original  data changes, but the splitting results will remain unchanged. If we apply logistic  regression to the stroke risk data, a missing value of a feature will break the  algorithm. However, decision trees are more robust to achieve relatively stable  results. For example, if a person who doesn't smoke misses the weight data, they can  be classified into the low-risk or middle-risk groups randomly  of course, there are  better ways to decide, such as selecting the mode of records similar to it , but they  won't be classified into high-risk groups. This result is sometimes good enough for  practical use.     Explainability: When a decision tree is trained, you are not only getting a model,  but you also get a set of rules that you can explain to your boss or supervisor. This  is also why I love the decision tree the most. The importance of features can also  be extracted. For example, in general, the closer the feature is to the root, the more  important the feature is in the model. In the stroke risk example, smoking is the  root node that enjoys the highest feature importance. We will talk about how the  positions of the features are decided in the next chapter.  Now, let's also talk about a few disadvantages of the decision tree:     It is easy to overfit: Without control or penalization, decision trees can be very  complex. How? Imagine that unless there are two records with exactly the same  features but different outcome variables, the decision tree can actually build one  leaf node for every record to reach 100% accuracy on the training set! However, the  model will very likely not be generalized to another dataset. Pruning is a common  approach to remove over-complex sub-branches. There are also constraints on the  splitting step, which we will discuss soon.   278     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods      The greedy approach doesn't necessarily give the best model: A single decision   tree is built by greedily selecting the best splitting feature sequentially. As a  combination problem with an exponential number of possibilities, the greedy  approach doesn't necessarily give the best model. In most cases, this isn't a problem.  In some cases, a small change in the training dataset might generate a completely  different decision tree and give a different set of rules. Make sure you double-check  it before presenting it to your boss!  Note To understand why building a decision tree involves selecting rules from a  combination of choices, let's build a decision tree with a depth of 3, trained on  a dataset of three continuous variable features. We have three decision nodes,  including the root node, to generate four leaves. Each decision node can choose  from three features for splitting, therefore resulting in a total of 27 possibilities.  Yes, one child node can choose the same feature as its parent. Imagine we have four features; then, the total number of choices becomes 64.  If the depth of the tree increases by 1, then we add four more decision nodes.  Therefore, the total number of splitting feature choices is 16,384, which is huge  for such a four-feature dataset. Most trees will obviously be useless, but the  greedy approach doesn't guarantee the generation of the best decision tree.  We have covered the terminology, advantages, and disadvantages of decision trees. In the  next section, we will dive deeper into decision trees, specifically how branches of a tree are  grown and pruned.  Growing and pruning a classification tree Let's start by examining the dataset one more time. We will first simplify our problem to  a binary case so that the demonstration of decision tree growing is simpler. Let's examine  Figure 10.1 again. For the purpose of this demonstration, I will just group the middle-risk and high-risk  patients into the high-risk group. This way, the classification problem becomes a binary  classification problem, which is easier to explain. After going through this section, you   can try the exercises on the original three-category problem for practice. The following code snippet generates the new dataset that groups middle-risk and   high-risk patients together:  df["stroke_risk"] = df["stroke_risk"].apply lambda x: "low" if  x == "low" else "high"    The new dataset will then look as follows:  Growing and pruning a classification tree     279  Figure 10.3 – Binary stroke risk data  Now, let's think about the root node. Which feature and what kind of criteria should we  choose to generate two children nodes from the root node that contains all the records  data points? We will explore this topic in the next section.  Understanding how splitting works The principle of splitting is that splitting, as a feature, must get us closer to a completely  correct classification. We need a numerical metric to compare different choices of splitting  features. The goal for classification is to classify records into pure states such that each  leaf will contain records that are as pure as possible. Therefore, pureness or impureness  becomes a natural choice of metric. The most common metric is called Gini impurity. It measures how impure a set of data   is. For a binary class set of data with class labels A and B, the definition of Gini impurity   is the following:  𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1− 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 2– 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 2    If the set only contains A or B, the Gini impurity is 0. The maximum impurity is 0.5 when  half of the records are A and the other half are B. For a three-class dataset, the minimum is   280     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   still 0 but the maximum becomes 23 .   Note Gini impurity is named after the Italian demographer and statistician Corrado  Gini. Another well-known index named after him is the Gini index, which  measures the inequality of wealth distribution in a society.  Let's see how this unfolds at the root node, without any splitting. The Gini impurity is   calculated as 1− 815 2− 715 2  because we have eight low-risk records and seven      high-risk records. The value is about 0.498, close to the highest possible impurity. After splitting by one criterion, we have two children nodes. The way to obtain the new,  lower impurity is to calculate the weighted Gini impurity of the two children nodes.  First, let's take the high-oil diet group as an example. Let's examine the partition of the  high-oil diet group. The following code snippet does the counting:  Counter df[df["high_oil_diet"]=="yes"]["stroke_risk"]   There is a total of six records with two low-risk records and four high-risk records.   Therefore, the impurity for the high-oil diet group is 1− 13 2− 23 2=49 .  Meanwhile, we can calculate the non-high-oil diet group's statistics. Let's select and count  them using the following code snippet:  Counter df[df["high_oil_diet"]=="no"]["stroke_risk"]   There is a total of nine records with six low-risk records and three high-risk records. Note  that the proportionalities are the same for the high-oil diet but with exchanging groups.   Therefore, the Gini impurity is also 49 .  The weighted Gini impurity remains 49  because 49615+49915=49 . It is about 0.444.  So, what do we get from such a classification? We have reduced the Gini impurity from  0.498 to 0.444, which is just a slight decrease, but better than nothing. Next, let's examine the smoking behavior.    Growing and pruning a classification tree     281  By the same token, let's first check the smoking group's statistics. The following code  snippet does the counting:  Counter df[df["smoking"]=="yes"]["stroke_risk"]   There is a total of seven smoking cases. Five of them are of high stroke risk and two of  them are of low stroke risk. The Gini impurity is therefore about 0.408. Let's check the non-smokers:  Counter df[df["smoking"]=="no"]["stroke_risk"]   There are eight non-smokers: six of them are of low stroke risk and two of them are of  high stroke risk. Therefore, the Gini impurity is 0.375.  Let's obtain the weighted impurity, which is about 0.408715+0.375815=0.390 .   This is a 0.108 decrease from the original impurity without splitting and it is better than  the splitting on the high-oil diet group. I will omit the calculation for the other feature, weight, but I will list the result for you in  the following table. Note that the weight feature has three levels, so there can be multiple  rules for splitting the feature. Here, I list all of them.  In the yes and no group statistics, I list the number of high-stroke risk records, the  number of low-risk records, and the Gini impurity value separated by commas:  Figure 10.4 – The Gini impurity evaluation table for different splitting features at the root node   282     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   Note that I highlighted the Gini impurity for the high-weight group and the weighted Gini  impurity for the last splitting choice. All high-weight patients have a high stroke risk, and  this drives the weighted impurity down to 0.356, the lowest of all possible splitting rules.  Therefore, we choose the last rule to build our decision tree. After the first splitting, the  decision tree now looks like the following:  Figure 10.5 – The decision tree after the first splitting  Note that the left branch now contains a pure node, which becomes a leaf. Therefore, our  next stop only focuses on the right branch. We naturally have an imbalanced tree now. Now, we have four choices for the splitting of 12 records. First, I will select  these 12 records out with the following one-line code snippet: df_right =  df[df["weight"]!="high"]. The result looks as follows. The Gini impurity for the right splitting node is 0.444, as  calculated previously. This will become our new baseline:  Figure 10.6 – The low-weight and middle-weight group   Growing and pruning a classification tree     283  As we did earlier, let's build a table to compare different splitting choices for the splitting  node on the right. The ordering of the numbers is the same as in the previous table:  Figure 10.7 – The Gini impurity evaluation table for different splitting features at the right splitting node We essentially only have three choices because the two splitting rules on the feature weight  are mirrors of each other. Now, we have a tie. We can randomly select one criterion for building the trees further.  This is one reason why decision trees don't theoretically generate the best results.   Note An intuitive way to solve this issue is to build both possibilities and even more  possible trees, which violates the greedy approach, and let them vote on the  prediction results. This is a common method to build a more stable model or  an ensemble of models. We will cover related techniques in the next chapter.  Let's say I choose high-oil diet as the criteria. The tree now looks like the following:  Figure 10.8 – The decision tree after the second splitting   284     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   Now, let's look at the two newly generated nodes. The first one at a depth of 2 contains two  high stroke risk records and two low stroke risk records. They don't have a heavy weight,  but do have a high-oil diet. Let's check out their profile with this line of code:  df_right[df_right["high_oil_diet"]=="yes"]  The result looks like the following:  Figure 10.9 – Records classified into the first node at a depth of 2  Note that the low-weight category contains one low stroke risk record and a high stroke  risk example. The same situation happens with the middle-weight category. This makes  the decision tree incapable of further splitting on any feature. There won't be any Gini  impurity decreasing for splitting. Therefore, we can stop here for this node.  Note Well, what if we want to continue improving the classification results? As you  just discovered, there is no way that the decision tree can classify these four  records, and no other machine learning method can do it either. The problem is  in the data, not in the model. There are two main approaches to solve this issue.  The first option is to try to obtain more data. With more data, we may find that  low weight is positively correlated with low stroke risk and further splitting on  the weight feature might benefit decreasing the Gini impurity. Obtaining more  data is always better because your training model gets to see more data, which  therefore reduces possible bias. Another option is to introduce more features.  This essentially expands the feature space by more dimensions. For example,  blood pressure might be another useful feature that might help us further  increase the accuracy of the decision tree.   Growing and pruning a classification tree     285  Now, let's look at the second node at depth 2. The records classified into this node are the  following, given by the df_right[df_right["high_oil_diet"]!="yes"] code:  Figure 10.10 – Records classified into the second node at a depth of 2  Note that only two high stroke risk records are in this node. If we stop here, the Gini   impurity is 1−0.252−0.752=0.375 , which is quite a low value.   If we further split on the smoking feature, note that out of all the non-smokers, four of  them have a low stroke risk. Half of the smokers have a high stroke risk and the other half  have a low stroke risk. This will give us a weighted Gini impurity of 0.25 if we're splitting  on smoking. If we further split on the weight feature, all the low-weight patients are at low stroke risk.  Two out of five middle-weight records are at high risk. This will give us a weighted Gini   impurity of 58 1− 25 2− 35 2 =0.3 , which is also not bad.   286     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   For the two cases, the final decision trees look as follows. The following decision tree has  smoking as the last splitting feature:  Figure 10.11 – Final decision tree, version 1   Growing and pruning a classification tree     287  The other choice is splitting on weight, again at the second node, at depth 2. The following  tree will be obtained:  Now, we need to make some hard choices to decide the final shape of our decision trees.  Figure 10.12 – Final decision tree, version 2  Evaluating decision tree performance In this section, let's evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifiers. If we stop   at depth 2, we have the following confusion matrix. Note that for the unclassifiable first  node at depth 2, we can randomly assign it a label. Here, I assign it as high stroke risk.   The performance of our classifier can be summarized in the following table concisely:  Figure 10.13 – Confusion matrix of a decision tree of depth 2   288     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   Generally, we identify high risk as positive, so the precision, recall, and F1 score are all 57 .   If you have forgotten these concepts, you can review previous chapters. If we don't stop at a depth of 2, the two finer decisions trees will have the following  confusion matrices. Again, we assign the unclassifiable first node at depth 2 the label high  stroke risk. However, the first node at depth 3 is also unclassifiable, because it contains  equal high stroke risk and low stroke risk records. If they are classified as low-risk ones,  then we essentially obtain the same result as the depth-of-2 one. Therefore, we assign the  first leaf node at depth 3 a high stroke risk value. The new confusion matrix will look   as follows:  Figure 10.14 – Confusion matrix of a decision tree of depth 3, version 1  Note that we will have perfect recall, but the precision will be just slightly better than a   random guess, 712  . The F1 score is 1419 .   Next, let's check our final version. If we split with weight, the corresponding confusion  matrix looks as shown in the following table:  Figure 10.15 – Confusion matrix of a decision tree of depth 3, version 2  The precision recall and F1 score will be identical to the depth 2 decision tree. In real  life, we usually prefer the simplest model possible if it is as good or almost as good as the  complicated ones. Although the first depth 3 decision tree has a better F1 score, it also  introduces one more unclassifiable node and one more rule. The second depth 3 decision  tree does no better than the depth 2 one.  To constrain the complexity of the decision tree, there are usually three methods:     Constrain the depth of the tree: This is probably the most direct way of   constraining the complexity of the decision tree.     Constrain the lower bound of the number of records classified into a node: For   example, if after splitting one child node will only contain very few data points, then  it is likely not a good splitting.    Exploring regression tree     289     Constrain the lower bound of information gain: In our case, the information gain   means lower Gini impurity. For example, if we set a criterion that each splitting  must lower the information gain by 0.1, then the splitting will likely stop soon,  therefore confining the depth of the decision tree.  We will see algorithmic examples on a more complex dataset later in this chapter.  Note When the number of records in a splitting node is small, the Gini impurity  reduction is no longer as representative as before. It is the same idea as in  statistical significance. The larger the sample size is, the more confident we are  about the derived statistics. You may also hear the term size of the decision tree. Usually, the size is not the  same as the depth. The size refers to the total number of nodes in a decision  tree. For a symmetric decision tree, the relationship is exponential.  Exploring regression tree The regression tree is very similar to a classification tree. A regression tree takes numerical  features as input and predicts another numerical variable.   Note It is perfectly fine to have mix-type features – for example, some of them are  discrete and some of them are continuous. We won't cover these examples due  to space limitations, but they are straightforward.  There are two very important visible differences:     The output is not discrete labels but rather numerical values.    The splitting rules are not similar to yes-or-no questions. They are usually   inequalities for values of certain features.  In this section, we will just use a one-feature dataset to build a regression tree that the  logistic regression classifier won't be able to classify. I created an artificial dataset with   the following code snippet:  def price_2_revenue price :     if price < 85:         return 70 * abs price - 75      elif price < 95:   290     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods           return 10 * 80     else:         return 80 *  105 - price   prices = np.linspace 80,100,8  revenue = np.array [price_2_revenue price  for price in  prices]  plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.figure figsize= 10,8   plt.scatter prices,revenue,s=300  plt.xlabel "price"  plt.ylabel "total revenue"  plt.title "Price versus Revenue" ;  Let's say we want to investigate the relationship between the price of an item and its total  revenue a day. If the price is set too low, the revenue will be lower because the price is  low. If the price is too high, the revenue will also be low due to fewer amounts of the item  being sold. The DataFrame looks as follows:  Figure 10.16 – Price and total revenue DataFrame   The following visualization makes this scenario clearer:  Exploring regression tree     291  Figure 10.17 – The relationship between price and revenue  The relationship between price and revenue is clearly non-linear, and logistic regression  won't be able to classify it. A linear regression will likely become a horizontal line. There  are clearly three regions where different relationships between revenue and price apply. Now, let's build a regression tree. Like the deduction of Gini impurity in the classification  tree, we need a metric to measure the benefit of splitting. A natural choice is still the sum  of squared residuals.  Let's start from the root node. We have eight data points, so there are essentially seven  intervals where we can put the first splitting criteria into. For example, we can split at  price = 85. Then, we use the average revenue on both sides to be our prediction, as  follows. The code snippet for the visualization reads as follows:  plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.figure figsize= 12,8   plt.scatter prices,revenue,s=300  plt.xlabel "price"  plt.ylabel "total revenue"  plt.title "Price versus Revenue"  threshold = 85 num_left = sum prices < threshold  ave_left = np.mean revenue[prices < threshold]    292     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   num_right = sum prices > threshold  ave_right = np.mean revenue[prices > threshold]   plt.axvline threshold,color="red",linewidth=6  plt.plot prices[prices < threshold], [ave_left for _ in  range num_left ],          linewidth=6,linestyle=":",c="orange",           label= "average revenue on the left half"  plt.plot prices[prices > threshold], [ave_right for _ in  range num_right ],          linewidth=6,linestyle="--",c="green",         label="average revenue on the right half" ; plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 16}  plt.legend loc=[0.4,0] ;  In the following figure, the dotted line represents the average price for the scenario when  the price is lower than 85.0. The dashed line represents the average price for the scenario  when the price is higher than 85.0:  Figure 10.18 – Splitting at price 85.0   If we stop here, the regression tree will have a depth of 1 and looks like the following:  Exploring regression tree     293  Figure 10.19 – A regression tree of depth 1  However, we haven't tested the other six splitting choices. Any splitting choice will have a  corresponding sum of squared residuals and we would like to go over all the possibilities  to determine the splitting that gives the minimal sum of squared residuals.  Note Unlike Gini impurity, where we need to take a weighted average, the total  sum of squared residuals is a simple summation. Gini impurity is not additive  because it only takes a value between 0 and 1. Squared residuals are additive  because each residual corresponds to one data point.  The following code snippet plots the sum of squared residuals against different choices  of splitting. For completion, I plotted more than seven splitting values to visualize the  stepped pattern:  def cal_ssr arr :     if len arr ==0:         return 0     ave = np.mean arr      return np.sum  arr-ave **2  splitting_values = np.linspace 80,100,20  ssr_values = [] for splitting_value in splitting_values:     ssr = cal_ssr revenue[prices < splitting_value]  + cal_ ssr revenue[prices > splitting_value]      ssr_values.append ssr         294     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.figure figsize= 12,8   plt.xlabel "splitting prices"  plt.ylabel "sum of squared residuals"  plt.title "Splitting Price versus Sum of Squared Residuals"  plt.plot splitting_values,ssr_values ;  The result looks as in the following figure:  Figure 10.20 – Splitting value for the root node versus the sum of squared residuals  The visualization in the preceding figure indicates that 85.0, or any value between the  second point and the third point, is the best splitting value for the root node.  There are only two records in the first node with a depth of 1, so we focus on the second  node and repeat the process explained here. The code is omitted due to space limitations.  The visualization of the sum of squared residuals is the following:   Exploring regression tree     295  Figure 10.21 – Splitting choices at the second node at depth 1  Now, in order to achieve the minimum sum of squared error, we should put the last data  point into one child node. However, you see that if we split at 98, the penalty we pay is not  increasing much. If we include another one, such as splitting at 96, the penalty will soar.  It may be a good idea to split at 96 rather than 98 because a leaf node containing too few  records is not representative in general and often indicates overfitting. Here is the final  look of our regression tree. You can calculate the regressed average prices in each region  easily. The final regression tree looks as follows:   Figure 10.22 – Final regression tree   296     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   The following figure shows a visualization for the partition of the regions:  Figure 10.23 – Regressed values and region partitioning  In multi-feature cases, we will have more than one feature. The scanning of the best  splitting value should include all the features, but the idea is the same.  Using tree models in scikit-learn Before ending this chapter, let's try out the scikit-learn API. You can verify that the results  agree with our models built from scratch. The following code snippet builds a regression  tree with a maximum depth of 1 on the price-revenue data:  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn import tree prices, revenue = prices.reshape -1,1 , revenue.reshape -1,1  regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor random_state=0,max_depth=1  regressor.fit prices,revenue    Using tree models in scikit-learn     297  Now, we can visualize the tree with the following code snippet:  plt.figure figsize= 12,8   tree.plot_tree regressor ;  The tree structure looks as follows:  Figure 10.24 – Regression tree visualization of depth 1  Next, we limit the maximum depth to 2 and require the minimal number of records  samples in a leaf node to be 2. The code only requires a small change in the following line:  regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor random_state=0,max_ depth=2,min_samples_leaf=2   After running the code, we obtain the following tree structure:  Figure 10.25 – Regression tree visualization of depth 2   298     Statistics for Tree-Based Methods   As you can see, this produces exactly the same results as the one we built from scratch.  Note The scikit-learn decision tree API can't explicitly handle categorical variables.  There are various options, such as one-hot encoding, that you can use to bypass  this limitation. You are welcome to explore the solutions on your own.  Summary In this chapter, we started with the fundamental concepts of decision trees, and then built  a simple classification tree and a regression tree from scratch. We went over the details  and checked the consistency with the scikit-learn library API.  You may notice that tree methods do tend to overfit and might fail to reach the optimal  model. In the next chapter, we will explore the so-called ensemble learning. They are  meta-algorithms that can be used on top of many other machine learning algorithms   as well.   11  Statistics for  Ensemble Methods  In this chapter, we are going to investigate the ensemble method in terms of statistics  and machine learning. The English word ensemble means a group of actors or musicians  that work together as a whole. The ensemble method, or ensemble learning in machine  learning, is not a specific machine learning algorithm, but a meta learning algorithm that  builds on top of concrete machine learning algorithms to bundle them together to achieve  better performance.  The ensemble method is not a single method, but a collection of many. In this chapter, we  will cover the most important and representative ones.  We are going to cover the following in this chapter:    Revisiting bias, variance, and memorization    Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging techniques    Understanding and using the boosting module    Exploring random forests with scikit-learn  Let's get started!   300     Statistics for Ensemble Methods Revisiting bias, variance, and memorization Ensemble methods can improve the result of regression or classification tasks in that  they can be applied to a group of classifiers or regressors to help build a final, augmented  model.  Since we are talking about performance, we must have a metric for improving  performance. Ensemble methods are designed to either reduce the variance or the bias of  the model. Sometimes, we want to reduce both to reach a balanced point somewhere on  the bias-variance trade-off curve. We mentioned the concepts of bias and variance several times in earlier chapters. To help  you understand how the idea of ensemble learning originated, I will revisit these concepts  from the perspective of data memorization. Let's say the following schematic visualization represents the relationship between the  training dataset and the real-world total dataset. The solid line shown in the following  diagram separates the seen world and the unseen part:  Figure 11.1 – A schematic representation of the observed data  Suppose we want to build a classifier that distinguishes between the circles and the  squares. Unfortunately, our observed data is only a poor subset of the original data.  In most cases, we do not know the entire set of real-world data, so we don't know how  representative our accessible dataset is. We want to train a model to classify the two classes; that is, square and circle. However,  since our trained model will only be exposed to the limited observed data, different  choices regarding which model we choose, as well as its complexity, will give us different  results. Let's check out the following two decision boundaries.   Revisiting bias, variance, and memorization     301  First, we can draw a decision boundary as a horizontal line, as shown in the following  diagram. This way, one square data point is misclassified as a round one:  Figure 11.2 – A simple decision boundary  Alternatively, we can draw a decision boundary the other way, as shown in the following  diagram. This zigzagging boundary will correctly classify both the square data points and  the round data points:  Figure 11.3 – A more complex decision boundary  Can you tell which classification method is better? With our hindsight of knowing what  the entire dataset looks like, we can tell that neither is great. However, the difference is  how much we want our model to learn from the known data. The structure of the training  dataset will be memorized by the model. The question is, how much?  Note on memorization Data memorization means that when a model is being trained, it is exposed to  the training set, so it remembers the characteristics or structure of the training  data. This is a good thing when the model has high bias because we want it  to learn, but it becomes notoriously bad when its memory gets stuck in the  training data and fails to generalize. Simply put, when a model memorizes and  learns too little of the training data, it has high bias. When it learns too much, it  has high variance.   302     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  Because of this, we have the following famous curve of the relationship between model  complexity and error. This is probably the most important graph for any data scientist  interview:   Figure 11.4 – The relationship between model complexity and error  When model complexity increases, the error – in terms of mean squared error or any  other form – will always decrease monotonically. Recall that when we discussed R2, we  said that adding any predictor feature will increase the R2 rate. On the other hand, the performance of the learned model will start to decrease on  the test dataset or other unseen datasets. This is because the model learns too many  ungeneralizable characteristics, such as the random noise of the training data. In the  preceding example, the zigzagging boundary doesn't apply to the rest of the dataset. To summarize, underfitting means that the model is biased toward its original  assumption, which means there's information that's missing from the training set. On the  other hand, overfitting means that too many training set-specific properties were learned,  so the model's complexity is too high.  Underfitting and overfitting High bias corresponds to underfitting, while high variance corresponds to  overfitting. Humans also fall into similar traps. For example, a CEO is very  busy, so he she does not have a lot of free time to spend with his her kids.  What is the most likely job of the kids' mother? Most people will likely say  homemaker. However, I didn't specify the gender of the CEO. Well, the CEO   is the mother!    Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging techniques     303  As the power of machine learning algorithms grows, the necessity to curb overfitting  and find a balance between bias and variance is prominent. Next, we'll learn about the  bootstrapping and bagging techniques, both of which can help us solve these issues.  Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging  techniques Bootstrapping is a pictorial word. It allows us to imagine someone pulling themselves up  by their bootstraps. In other words, if no one is going to help us, then we need to help  ourselves. In statistics, however, this is a sampling method. If there is not enough data, we  help ourselves by creating more data.  Imagine that you have a small dataset and you want to build a classifier estimator with this  limited amount of data. In this case, you can perform cross-validation. Cross-validation  techniques such as 10-fold cross-validation will decrease the number of records in each  fold even further. We can take all the data as the training data, but you likely will end up  with a model with very high variance. What should we do, then? The bootstrapping method says that if the dataset being used is a sample of the unknown  data in the dataset, why not try resampling again? The bootstrap method creates new  training sets by uniformly sampling from the dataset and then replacing it. This process can  be repeated as many times as it's necessary to create many new training datasets. Each new  training set can be used to train a classifier regressor. Besides the magic of creating training datasets from thin air, bootstrapping has two  significant advantages:     Bootstrapping increases the randomness in the training set. It is likely that such   randomness will help us avoid capturing the intrinsic random noise in the   original training set.     Bootstrapping can help build the confidence interval of calculated statistics  plural   form of statistic . Suppose we run bootstrapping N times and obtain N new samples.  By doing this, we can calculate the standard variation of a selected statistic, which is  not possible without bootstrapping.  Before we move on, let's examine how bootstrapping works on a real dataset. We are going  to use the Boston Housing Dataset, which you can find in its official GitHub repository:  https:  github.com PacktPublishing Essential-Statistics-for- Non-STEM-Data-Analysts. You can also find the meanings of each column in the  respective Jupyter notebook. It contains information regarding the per capita crime rate by  town, average number of rooms per dwelling, and so on.    304     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  Later in this chapter, we will use these features to predict the target feature; that is, the  median value of owner-occupied homes  medv .   Turning a regression problem into a classification problem I am going to build a classifier for demonstration purposes, so I will transform  the continuous variable, medv, into a binary variable that indicates whether   a house's price is in the upper 50% or lower 50% of the market.  The first few lines of records in the original dataset look as follows. Due to space  limitations, most of the code, except for the crucial pieces, will be omitted here:  Figure 11.5 – Main section of the Boston Housing Dataset  First, let's plot the distribution of the index of accessibility to radial highways variable.  Here, you can see that this distribution is quite messy; no simple distribution can model   it parametrically. Let's say that this is our entire dataset for selecting the training dataset   in this demo:  Figure 11.6 – Index of accessibility to radial highways distribution  the dataset contains 506 records    Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging techniques     305  Now, let's select 50 pieces of data to be our training observed data. This distribution  looks as follows. Notice that the y-axis has a different scale. The functions we'll be using  to perform sampling can be found in the scikit-learn library. Please refer to the relevant  Jupyter notebook for details:  Figure 11.7 – Index of accessibility to radial highways distribution  our original sample,    which contains 50 records   Next, let's run bootstrapping 1,000 times. For each round, we'll sample 25 records. Then,  we will plot these new samples on the same histogram plot. Here, you can see that the  overlapping behavior drops some characteristics of the 50-record sample, such as the very  high peak on the left-hand side:  Figure 11.8 – Overlapping 1,000 times with our bootstrapped sample containing 25 records   306     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  Next, we will learn how this will help decrease the variance of our classifiers by  aggregating the classifiers that were trained on the bootstrapped sets. The word bagging  is essentially an abbreviation of bootstrap aggregation. This is what we will study in the  remainder of this section. The premise of bagging is to train some weak classifiers or regressors on the newly  bootstrapped training sets and then aggregating them together through a majority vote  averaging mechanism to obtain the final prediction.  The following code performs preprocessing and dataset splitting. I am going to use   a decision tree as our default weak classifier, so feature normalization won't be necessary:  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split import numpy as np boston_bag = boston.copy   boston_bag["medv"] = boston_bag["medv"].apply lambda x: int x>=  np.median boston_bag["medv"]    boston_bag_train, boston_bag_test = train_test_split boston_ bag,train_size=0.7,shuffle=True,random_state=1  boston_bag_train_X, boston_bag_train_y = boston_bag_train. drop ["medv"],axis=1 .to_numpy  ,  boston_bag_train["medv"]. to_numpy   boston_bag_test_X, boston_bag_test_y = boston_bag_test. drop ["medv"],axis=1 .to_numpy  ,  boston_bag_test["medv"]. to_numpy     Note that I explicitly made a copy of the boston DataFrame.  Now, I'm going to  try and reproduce something to show the overfitting on the test set  with a single decision tree. I will control the maximal depth of the single decision tree in  order to control the complexity of the model. Then, I'll plot the F1 score with respect to  the tree depth, both on the training set and the test set. Without any constraints regarding model complexity, let's take a look at how the  classification tree performs on the training dataset. The following code snippet plots the  unconstrained classification tree:  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.metrics import f1_score from sklearn import tree clf = DecisionTreeClassifier random_state=0  clf.fit boston_bag_train_X, boston_bag_train_y    Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging techniques     307  plt.figure figsize= 12,8   tree.plot_tree clf ;  By doing this, we obtain a huge decision tree with a depth of 10. It is hard to see the details  clearly, but the visualization of this is shown in the following diagram:  The F1 score can be calculated by running the following:   Figure 11.9 – Unconstrained single decision tree   f1_score boston_bag_train_y,clf.predict boston_bag_train_X     This is exactly 1. This means we've obtained the best performance possible. Next, I'll build a sequence of classifiers and limit the maximal depth it can span. I'll  calculate the F1 score of the model on the train set and test set in the same way. The code  for this is as follows:  train_f1 = [] test_f1 = [] depths = range 1,11  for depth in depths:     clf = DecisionTreeClassifier random_state=0,max_   308     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  depth=depth      clf.fit boston_bag_train_X, boston_bag_train_y      train_f1.append f1_score boston_bag_train_y,clf. predict boston_bag_train_X        test_f1.append f1_score boston_bag_test_y,clf. predict boston_bag_test_X     The following code snippet plots the two curves:  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.plot depths,train_f1,label="Train Set F1 Score"  plt.plot depths,test_f1, label="Test Set F1 Score"  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "Model Complexity"  plt.ylabel "F1 Score"  plt.title "F1 Score on Train and Test Set" ;  The following graph is what we get. Note that the F1 score is an inverse indicator metric of  the error. The higher the F1 score is, the better the model is in general:  Figure 11.10 – F1 score versus model complexity   Although the F1 score on the training set continues increasing to reach the maximum, the  F1 score on the test set stops increasing once the depth reaches 4 and gradually decreases  beyond that. It is clear that after a depth of 4, we are basically overfitting the decision tree.   Understanding the bootstrapping and bagging techniques     309  Next, let's see how bagging would help. We are going to utilize the  BaggingClassifier API in scikit-learn. First, since we roughly know that the critical  depth is 4, we'll build a base estimator of such depth before creating a bagging classifier  marked out of 10 for it. Each time, we'll draw samples from the training dataset to build a  base estimator. The code for this reads as follows:  from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier  base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier random_state = 0, max_ depth = 4  bagging_clf = BaggingClassifier base_estimator=base_estimator,                                  n_estimators=10,                                 n_jobs=20,                                  max_samples=0.7,                                 random_state=0,   bagging_clf.fit boston_bag_train_X, boston_bag_train_y   Next, let's plot the relationship between the F1 score and the number of base estimators:  train_f1 = [] test_f1 = [] n_estimators = [2**i+1 for i in range 1,8 ] for n_estimator in n_estimators:     bagging_clf = BaggingClassifier base_estimator=base_ estimator,                                      n_estimators=n_estimator,                                     n_jobs=20,                                      random_state=0,      bagging_clf.fit boston_bag_train_X, boston_bag_train_y ;     train_f1.append f1_score boston_bag_train_y, bagging_clf. predict boston_bag_train_X        test_f1.append f1_score boston_bag_test_y, bagging_clf. predict boston_bag_test_X    plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.plot n_estimators,train_f1,label="Train Set F1 Score"  plt.plot n_estimators,test_f1, label="Test Set F1 Score"  plt.xscale "log"  plt.legend     310     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  plt.xlabel "Number of Estimators"  plt.ylabel "F1 Score"  plt.title "F1 Score on Train and Test Set" ;  The resulting of running the preceding code is displayed in the following graph. Note that  the x-axis is on the log scale:  Figure 11.11 – F1 score versus number of estimators  As you can see, even on the training set, the F1 score stops increasing and begins to  saturate and decline a little bit  pay attention to the y-axis , which indicates that there is  still an intrinsic difference between the training set and the test set. There may be several  reasons for this performance, and I will point out two here:     The first reason is that it is possible that we are intrinsically unlucky; that is, there   was some significant difference between the training set and the test set in the  splitting step.      The second reason is that our depth restriction doesn't successfully constrain the   complexity of the decision tree.   What we can do here is try another random seed and impose more constraints on   the splitting condition. For example, changing the following two lines will produce   different results:     First, we'll change how the dataset is split:   boston_bag_train, boston_bag_test = train_test_ split boston_bag,train_size=0.7,shuffle=True,random_ state=1     Understanding and using the boosting module     311     Second, we'll impose a new constraint on the base estimator so that a node must be   large enough to be split:   base_estimator = DecisionTreeClassifier random_state = 0,  max_depth = 4,min_samples_split=30   Due to further imposed regularization, it is somewhat clearer that the performance of  both the training set and the test set is consistent:  Note that the scale on the y-axis is much smaller than the previous one.  Figure 11.12 – F1 score under more regularization  Dealing with inconsistent results It is totally normal if the result is not very consistent when you're training  evaluating machine learning models. In such cases, try different sets of data to  eliminate the effect of randomness or run cross-validation.     If your result is inconsistent with the expected behavior, take steps to examine  the whole pipeline. Start with dataset completeness and tidiness, then  preprocessing and model assumptions. It is also possible that the way the  results are being visualized or presented is flawed.  Understanding and using the boosting module Unlike bagging, which focuses on reducing variance, the goal of boosting is to reduce bias  without increasing variance.   312     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  Bagging creates a bunch of base estimators with equal importance, or weights, in terms  of determining the final prediction. The data that's fed into the base estimators is also  uniformly resampled from the training set.   Determining the possibility of parallel processing From the description of bagging we provided, you may imagine that it is  relatively easy to run bagging algorithms. Each process can independently  perform sampling and model training. Aggregation is only performed at the  last step, when all the base estimators have been trained.     In the preceding code snippet, I set n_jobs = 20 to build the bagging  classifier. When it is being trained, 20 cores on the host machine will be used at  most.  Boosting solves a different problem. The primary goal is to create an estimator with low  bias. In the world of boosting, both the samples and the weak classifiers are not equal.  During the training process, some will be more important than others. Here is how   it works:  1.  First, we assign a weight to each record in the training data. Without special prior   knowledge, all the weights are equal.  2.  We then train our first base weak estimator on the entire dataset. After training, we   increase the weights of those records, which are predicted with wrong labels. 3.  Once the weights have been updated, we create the next base estimator. The   difference here is that those records that were misclassified by previous estimators,  or whose values seriously deviated from the true value provided by regression, now  receive higher attention. Misclassifying them again will result in higher penalties,  which will, in turn, increase their weight.  4.  Finally, we iterate step 3 until the preset iteration limit is reached or accuracy    stops improving.  Note that boosting is also a meta algorithm. This means that at different iterations, the  base estimator can be completely different from the previous one. You can use logistic  regression in the first iteration, use a neural network at the second iteration, and then use  a decision tree at the final iteration.  There are two classical boosting methods we can use: adaptive boosting  AdaBoost  and  gradient descent boosting.   Understanding and using the boosting module     313  First, we'll look at AdaBoost, where there are two kinds of weights:      The weights of the training set records, which change at every iteration     The weights of the estimators, which are determined inversely by their    training errors  The weight of a record indicates the probability that this record will be selected in the  training set for the next base estimator. For the estimator, the lower its training error is,  the more voting power it has in the final weighted classifier. The following is the pseudo-algorithm for AdaBoost:   , and calculate its corresponding weight; that is,   1.   of k.  3.  Obtain    , the error of   Initialize the equal-weight training data with weight { 2.  At round k, sample the data according to weight  {  1−    4.  Update the weight of each record for round  +1 ,  proportional to the form ∑ α  α =12   +1 ≈     +α  .  right; otherwise,    .  }  and a maximal iteration   }  and build a weak classifier,    .    +1 ≈     −α   if classified   5.  Repeat steps 2 to 4 k times and obtain the final classifier, which should be     will have an infinitely large weight. This   Intuition behind the AdaBoost algorithm At step 3, if there are no errors,  intuitively makes sense because if one weak classifier does the job, why bother  creating more? At step 4, if a record is misclassified, its weight will be increased exponentially;  otherwise, its weight will be decreased exponentially. Do a thought experiment  here: if a classifier correctly classifies most records but only a few, then those   records that have been misclassified will be  2α   times more likely to be   selected in the next round. This also makes sense.   AdaBoost is only suitable for classification tasks. For regression tasks, we can use the  Gradient Descent Boost  GDB  algorithm. However, please note that GDB can also be  used to perform classification tasks or even ranking tasks.   314     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  ’–   .   true value and    . . The weak estimator,     is a regressed value,  =    Let's take a look at the intuition behind GDB. In regression tasks, often, we want to   ’  means the  minimize the mean squared error, which takes the form 1∑   – ’ 2  , where  sum of residual  =∑   Sequentially, at iteration  +1 , we want to build another base estimator to remove such   residuals. If you know calculus and look closely, you'll see that the form of the residual is  proportional to the derivative of the mean squared error, also known as the loss function.  This is the key: improving the base estimator is not achieved by weighing records like it is  in AdaBoost, but by deliberately constructing it to predict the residuals, which happens to  be the gradient of the MSE. If a different loss function is used, the residual argument won't  be valid, but we still want to predict the gradients. The math here is beyond the scope of  this book, but you get the point.   , at round k has a   Does GDB work with the logistic regression base learner? The answer is a conditional no. In general, GDB doesn't work on simple logistic  regression or other simple linear models. The reason is that the addition of  linear models is still a linear mode. This is basically the essence of being linear.  If a linear model misclassifies some records, another linear model will likely  misclassify them. If it doesn't, the effect will be smeared at the last averaging  step too. This is probably the reason behind the illusion that ensemble algorithms are  only applicable to tree-based methods. Most examples are only given with tree  base estimators learners. People just don't use them on linear models.  As an example, let's see how GDB works on the regression task of predicting the median  price of Boston housing. The following code snippet builds the training dataset, the test dataset, and the regressor:  from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error  boston_boost = boston.copy   boston_boost_train, boston_boost_test = train_test_ split boston_boost,                                                      train_ size=0.7,                                                       shuffle=True,   Understanding and using the boosting module     315                                                       random_ state=1  boston_boost_train_X, boston_boost_train_y = boston_boost_ train.drop ["medv"],axis=1 .to_numpy  , boston_boost_ train["medv"].to_numpy   boston_boost_test_X, boston_boost_test_y = boston_boost_test. drop ["medv"],axis=1 .to_numpy  , boston_boost_test["medv"]. to_numpy   gdb_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor random_state=0   reg.fit boston_boost_train_X, boston_boost_train_y ;  print mean_squared_error reg.predict boston_boost_train_X ,  boston_boost_train_y    Here, the MSE on the training set is about 1.5. On the test set, it is about 7.1, which is  likely due to overfitting. Now, let's limit the number of iterations so that we can inspect the  turning point. The following code snippet will help us visualize this:  train_mse = [] test_mse = [] n_estimators = range 10,300,20  for n_estimator in n_estimators:     gdb_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor random_state=0,n_ estimators=n_estimator      gdb_reg.fit boston_boost_train_X, boston_boost_train_y ;     train_mse.append mean_squared_error gdb_reg.predict boston_ boost_train_X , boston_boost_train_y       test_mse.append mean_squared_error gdb_reg.predict boston_ boost_test_X , boston_boost_test_y   plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.plot n_estimators,train_mse,label="Train Set MSE"  plt.plot n_estimators,test_mse, label="Test Set MSE"  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "Number of Estimators"  plt.ylabel "MSE"  plt.title "MSE Score on Train and Test Set" ;   316     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  What we've obtained here is the classic behavior of bias-variance trade-off, as shown in the  following graph. Note that the error doesn't grow significantly after the turning point. This  is the idea behind decreasing bias without exploding the variance of boosting:  Figure 11.13 – Number of estimators in terms of boosting and MSE  At this point, you have seen how boosting works. In the next section, we will examine   a model so that you fully understand the what bagging is.  Exploring random forests with scikit-learn Now that we're near the end of this chapter, I would like to briefly discuss random forests.  Random forests are not strictly ensemble algorithms because they are an extension of tree  methods. However, unlike bagging decision trees, they are different in an important way. In Chapter 10, Statistical Techniques for Tree-Based Methods, we discussed how splitting  the nodes in a decision tree is a greedy approach. The greedy approach doesn't always  yield the best possible tree and it's easy to overfit without proper penalization. The random  forest algorithm does not only bootstrap the samples, but also the features. Let's take our  stroke risk dataset as an example. The heavy weight is the optimal feature to split on, but  this rules out 80% of all possible trees, along with the other features of the root node. The  random forest algorithm, at every splitting decision point, samples a subset of the   features and picks the best among them. This way, it is possible for the suboptimal   features to be selected.   Exploring random forests with scikit-learn     317  Non-greedy algorithms The idea of not using a greedy algorithm to achieve the potential optimal is   a key concept in AI. For example, in the game Go, performing a short-term  optimal move may lead to a long-term strategic disadvantage. A human Go  master is capable of farseeing such consequences. The most advanced AI  can also make decisions regarding what a human does, but at the cost of  exponentially expensive computation power. The balance between short-term  gain and long-term gain is also a key concept in reinforcement learning.  Let's take a look a code example of random forest regression to understand how the  corresponding API in scikit-learn is called:  train_mse = [] test_mse = [] n_estimators = range 10,300,20  for n_estimator in n_estimators:     regr = RandomForestRegressor max_depth=6,                               random_state=0,                              n_estimators=n_estimator,                             max_features="sqrt"      regr.fit boston_boost_train_X, boston_boost_train_y ;     train_mse.append mean_squared_error regr.predict boston_ boost_train_X , boston_boost_train_y       test_mse.append mean_squared_error regr.predict boston_ boost_test_X , boston_boost_test_y   plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.plot n_estimators,train_mse,label="Train Set MSE"  plt.plot n_estimators,test_mse, label="Test Set MSE"  plt.legend   plt.xlabel "Number of Estimators"  plt.ylabel "MSE"  plt.title "MSE Score on Train and Test Set" ;   318     Statistics for Ensemble Methods  The visualization we receive is also a typical bias-variance trade-off. Note that the  limitation of the max depth for each individual decision tree being set to 6 can  significantly decrease the power of the model anyway:   Figure 11.14 – Estimators versus MSE in random forest regression  One of the key features of random forests is their robustness against overfitting. The  relative flat curve of the test set's MSE is proof of this claim.  Summary  In this chapter, we discussed several important ensemble learning algorithms, including  bootstrapping for creating more training sets, bagging for aggregating weak estimators,  boosting for improving accuracy without increasing variance too much, and the random  forest algorithm. Ensemble algorithms are very powerful as they are models that build on top of basic  models. Understanding them will benefit you in the long run in terms of your data   science career. In the next chapter, we will examine some common mistakes and go over some best  practices in data science.   Section 4:   Appendix  Section 4 covers some real-world best practices that I have collected in my experience. It  also identifies common pitfalls that you should avoid. Exercises, projects, and instructions  for further learning are also provided. This section consists of the following chapters:    Chapter 12, A Collection of Best Practices     Chapter 13, Exercises and Projects    12 A Collection of   Best Practices  This chapter serves as a special chapter to investigate three important topics that are  prevalent in data science nowadays: data source quality, data visualization quality, and  causality interpretation. This has generally been a missing chapter in peer publications,  but I consider it essential to stress the following topics. I want to affirm that you, as a  future data scientist, will practice data science while following the best practice tips as  introduced in this chapter. After finishing this chapter, you will be able to do the following:     Understand the importance of data quality    Avoid using misleading data visualization    Spot common errors in causality arguments  First, let's start with the beginning of any data science project: the data itself.   322     A Collection of Best Practices  Understanding the importance of data quality Remember the old adage that says garbage in, garbage out? This is especially true in data  science. The quality of data will influence the entire downstream project. It is difficult for  people who work on the downstream tasks to identify the sources of possible issues. In the following section, I will present three examples in which poor data quality   causes difficulties.  Understanding why data can be problematic The three examples fall into three different categories that represent three   different problems:     Inherent bias in data    Miscommunication in large-scale projects    Insufficient documentation and irreversible preprocessing  Let's start with the first example, which is quite a recent one and is pretty much a hot   topic—face generation.  Bias in data sources The first example we are going to look at is bias in data. Face-Depixelizer is a tool that is  capable of significantly increasing the resolution of a human face in an image. You are  recommended to give it a try on the Colab file the developers released. It is impressive that  Generative Adversarial Network  GAN  is able to create faces of human in images that  are indistinguishable from real photos.  Generative adversarial learning Generative adversarial learning is a class of machine learning frameworks  that enable the algorithms to compete with each other. One algorithm creates  new data, such as sounds or images, by imitating original data, while another  algorithm tries to distinguish the original data and the created data. This  adversarial process can result in powerful machine learning models that can  create images, sounds, or even videos where humans are unable to tell whether  they are real.  However, people soon started encountering this issue within the model. Among all of  them, I found the following example discovered by Twitter user @Chicken3egg to be  the most disturbing one. The image on the left is the original picture, with low resolution,  and the one on the right is the picture that Face-Depixelizer generated:   Understanding the importance of data quality     323  Figure 12.1 – Face-Depixelizer example on the Obama picture  If you are familiar with American politics, you know the picture on the left is former  President Barack Obama. However, the generated picture turns out to be a completely  different guy. For a discussion on this behavior, please refer to the original tweet:  https:  twitter.com Chicken3gg status 1274314622447820801. This issue is nothing new in today's machine learning research and has attracted the  attention of the community. A machine learning model is nothing but a digestor of data,  which outputs what it learns from the data. Nowadays, there is little diversity in human  facial datasets, especially in the case of people from minority backgrounds, such as  African Americans. Not only will the characteristics of the human face be learned by the  model, but also its inherent bias.  This is a good example where flawed data may cause issues. If such models are deployed  in systems such as CCTV  closed-circuit television , the ethical consequences could be  problematic. To minimize such effects, we need to scrutinize our data before feeding it  into machine learning models.  The machine learning community has been working to address the data bias issue. As  the author of this book, I fully support the ethical progress in data science and machine  learning. For example, as of October 2020, the author of Face-Depixelizer has addressed  the data bias issue. You can find the latest updates in the official repository at https:   github.com tg-bomze Face-Depixelizer.  Miscommunication in large-scale projects When a project increases in size, miscommunication can lead to inconsistent data and  cause difficulties. Here, size may refer to code base size, team size, or the complexity of the  organizational structure. The most famous example is the loss of the 125 million-dollar  Mars climate orbiter from NASA in September 1999.   324     A Collection of Best Practices   Back then, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Lockheed Martin collaborated and built  a Mars orbiter. However, the engineering team at Lockheed Martin used English units of  measurement and the team at Jet Propulsion Laboratory used the conventional metric  system. For readers who are not familiar with the English unit, here is an example. Miles  are used to measure long distances, where 1 mile is about 1,600 meters, which is   1.6 kilometers. The orbiter took more than 280 days to reach Mars but failed to function. The reason was  later identified to be a mistake in unit usage.  Lorelle Young, president of the U.S. Metric Association, commented that two  measurement systems should not be used as the metric system is the standard  measurement language of all sophisticated science.   Units in the United States Technically speaking, the unit system in the United States is also different from  the English unit system. There are some subtle differences. Some states choose  the so-called United States customary, while others have adopted metric units  as official units.  This may not be a perfect example for our data science project since none of our  projects will ever be as grand or important as NASA's Mars mission. The point is that as  projects become more complex and teams grow larger, it is also easier to introduce data  inconsistency into projects.   The weakest stage of a project A point when a team upgrades their systems, dependencies, or algorithms is  the easiest stage to make mistakes and it is imperative that you pay the utmost  attention at this stage.  Insufficient documentation and irreversible preprocessing The third most common reason for poor quality data is the absence of documentation  and irreversible preprocessing. We briefly talked about this in Chapter 1, Fundamentals of  Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing. Data documentation is sometimes referred  to as metadata. It is the data about the dataset itself; for example, information about how  the data was obtained, who is responsible for queries with respect to the data, and the  meanings of abbreviations in the dataset.    Understanding the importance of data quality     325  In data science teams, especially for cross-team communication, such information is  often omitted based on my observations, but they are actually very important. You cannot  assume that the data speaks for itself. For example, I have used the Texas county dataset  throughout this book, but the meaning of the rural code can't be revealed unless you read  the specs carefully. Even if the original dataset is accompanied by metadata, irreversible  pre processing still  has the potential to damage the data's quality. One example I introduced earlier in Chapter  2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, is the categorization of numerical values. Such  preprocessing results in the loss of information and there isn't a way for people who take  the data from you to recover it. Similar processing includes imputation and min-max  scaling. The key to solving such issues is to embrace the culture of documentation and  reproducibility. In a data science team, it is not enough to share a result or a presentation;  it is important to share a reproducible result with well-written and easy-to-understand  documentation. In such instances, a Jupyter notebook is better than a script because you  can put text nicely with the code together. For the R ecosystem, there is R Markdown,  which is similar to a Jupyter notebook. You can demonstrate the pipeline of preprocessing  and algorithm functioning in an interactive fashion. The idea of painless reproducibility comes from different levels, and not only in a data  science project. For a general Python project, a requirements.txt file specifying  versions of dependencies can ensure the consistency of a Python environment. For our  book, in order to avoid possible hassles for readers who are not familiar with pip or  virtualenv, the Python package management and virtual environment management   tools, I have chosen Google Colab so that you can run the companying codes directly in   the browser.  A general idea of reproducibility A common developer joke you might hear is 'This works on my machine."  Reproducibility has been a true headache at different levels. For data science  projects, in order to make code and presentations reproducible, Jupyter  Notebooks, R Markdown, and many other tools were developed. In terms of  the consistency of libraries and packages, we have package management tools  such as pip for Python and npm for JavaScript. In order to enable large systems  to work across different hardware and environments, Docker was created to  isolate configurations of a running instance from its host machine. All these  technologies solve the same problem of painlessly reproducing a result or  performance consistently. This is a philosophical concept in engineering that  you should keep in mind.   326     A Collection of Best Practices   In the next section, we'll look at another aspect of common pitfalls in data   science–misleading graphs.  Avoiding the use of misleading graphs Graphics convey much more information than words. Not everyone understands P-values  or statistical arguments, but almost everyone can tell if one piece of a pie plot is larger  than another piece of pie plot, or if two-line plots share a similar trend. However, there   are many ways in which graphs can also damage the quality of a visualization or   mislead readers. In this section, we will examine two examples. Let's start with the first example –  misleading graphs.  Example 1 – COVID-19 trend The following graph is a screenshot taken in early April 2020. A news channel showed this  graph of new COVID-19 cases per day in the United States. Do you spot anything strange?  Figure 12.2 – A screenshot of COVID-19 coverage of a news channel   Avoiding the use of misleading graphs     327  The issue is on the y axis. If you look closely, the y axis tickers are not separated equally  but in a strange pattern. For example, the space between 30 and 60 is the same as the space  between 240 and 250. The distances vary from 10 up to 50.  Now, I will regenerate this plot without mashing the y axis tickers with the following   code snippet:  import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt dates =  pd.date_range '2020-03-18', periods=15, freq='D'  daily_cases = [33,61,86,112,116,129,192,174,344,304,327,246,32 0,339,376] plt.rcParams.update {'font.size': 22}  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.plot  dates,daily_cases, label='Daily Cases', marker='o'  plt.legend   plt.gca  .tick_params axis='x', which='major', labelsize=14  plt.xlabel 'Dates'  plt.ylabel 'New Daily Cases'  plt.title 'New Daily Cases Versus Dates'  plt.xticks rotation=45  for x,y in zip dates, daily_cases :      plt.text x, y, str y     328     A Collection of Best Practices   You will see the following visualization:  Figure 12.3 – New daily cases without modifying the y-axis tickers  What's the difference between this one and the one that the news channel showed to  its audience? The jump from 174 to 344 is much more significant, while the increase  from 246 to 376 is also more dramatic. The news channel manipulated the space used  to represent 10 or 30 to represent 50 when the number grew large. This way, the visual  impression is much weaker.  Next, let's look at another example that has the ability to confuse readers.  Example 2 – Bar plot cropping We are going to use the US county data for this example. Here, I am loading the data  with the following code snippet we used in Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics.  The difference is that this time, I am looking at the influence code of all counties in the  United States, and not limited to just Texas. The following code snippet performs the  visualization:  from collections import Counter df = pd.read_excel 'PopulationEstimates.xls',skiprows=2  counter = Counter df.tail -1 ['Urban_Influence_Code_2003']  codes = [key for key in counter.keys   if str key  != 'nan'] heights = [counter[code] for code in codes]   Avoiding the use of misleading graphs     329  plt.figure figsize= 10,6   plt.bar list map lambda x: str x ,codes  , heights  plt.xticks rotation=45 ; plt.title 'Urban Influence Code for All Counties in the US'  plt.xlabel 'Urban Influence Code'  plt.ylabel 'Count' ;  The result looks like the following:  Figure 12.4 – Urban influence code counting for all counties in the US  Note that I deliberately changed the urban influence code to a string and indicated that it  is a categorical variable, and not a numerical one. According to the definition, the urban  influence code is a 12-level classification of metropolitan counties developed by the  United States Department of Agriculture.    330     A Collection of Best Practices   Now, this is what happens if I add one more line to the previous code snippet:  plt.gca  .set_ylim [80,800]   We then obtain the data as shown in the following diagram:  Figure 12.5 – Urban influence code counting with limited y axis values  The new graph uses the same data and the exact same kind of bar plot. This visualization  is not wrong, but it is confusing as much as it is misleading. There are more than 100  counties with an urban influence code of 3.0, the third bar from right-hand side, but the  second visualization shows that there are probably no such counties.  The difference between being confusing and misleading is that misleading graphs are  usually coined carefully and deliberately to convey the wrong message; confusing graphs  may not. The visualizer might not realize the confusion that such data transformation or  capping will cause. There are other causes that may result in bad visualizations, for example, the improper  use of fonts and color. The more intense a color is, the greater the importance we place on  that element. Opacity is an important factor, too. The perception of linear opacity doesn't  always result in a linear impression of quantities. It is not safe to purely rely on visual  elements to make a quantitative judgement.    Avoiding the use of misleading graphs     331  In the next section, we will talk about another good practice: You should always question  causality arguments: Spot the common errors in this causality argument. A popular conspiracy theory in early  2020 is that the coronavirus is caused by 5G towers being built around the world. People  who support such a theory have a powerful graph to support their argument. I can't trace  the origin of such a widespread theory, but here are the two popular visualizations:  Figure 12.6 – Map of the world showing a 5G conspiracy theory   332     A Collection of Best Practices   The following map is similar, but this time limited to the United States:  Figure 12.7 – Map of the United States showing a 5G conspiracy theory  The top portion shows the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States, while the  lower portion shows the installation of 5G towers in the United States. These two graphs are used to support the idea that 5G causes the spread of COVID-19. Do  you believe it?    Avoiding the use of misleading graphs     333  Let's study this problem step by step from the following perspectives.     Is the data behind the graphics accurate?    Do the graphics correctly represent the data?    Does the visualization support the argument that 5G is resulting in the spread    of COVID-19?  For the first question, following some research, you will find that Korea, China, and the  United States are indeed the leading players in 5G installation. For example, as of February  2020, Korea has 5G coverage in 85 cities, while China has 5G coverage in 57 cities.  However, Russia's first 5G zone was only deployed in central Moscow in August 2019. For  the first question, the answer can roughly be true. However, the second question is definitively false. All of Russia and Brazil are colored to  indicate the seriousness of the spread of COVID-19 and 5G rollout. The visual elements  do not represent the data proportionally. Note that the maps first appeared online long  before cases in the United States and Brazil exploded. People can't tell the quantitative  relationship between the rollout coverage of 5G and the number of COVID-19 cases. The  graphic is both misleading and confusing. Onto the last question. The answer to this is also definitively false. However, the  misrepresentation issue got confused with the interpretation of the data for the world  map, so let's focus on the map of the United States. There are many ways to generate maps  such as the COVID-19 cases map or the 5G tower installation map, for example, by means  of population or urbanization maps. Since COVID-19 is transmitted mainly in the air and  by touching droplets containing the virus, population density and lifestyles play a key role  in its diffusion. This explains why areas with a high population are also areas where there  are more confirmed cases. From a business standpoint, AT&T and Verizon will focus heavily on offering 5G services  to high population density regions such as New York. This explains the density map  concerning 5G tower installation. Factors such as population density are called confounding factors. A confounding  factor is a factor that is a true cause behind another two or more factors. The causal  relationships are between the confounding factor and the other factors, not between the  non-confounding factors. It is a common trick to use visualization to suggest or represent  a causal relationship between two variables without stating the underlying reasons. That said, how do we detect and rebut the entire causal argument? Let's understand this in  the next section.   334     A Collection of Best Practices  Fighting against false arguments To refute false arguments, you need to do the following:     Maintain your curiosity to dig deeper into domain knowledge    Gather different perspectives from credible experts  To refute false arguments, domain knowledge is the key because domain knowledge can  reveal the details that loose causal arguments often hide from their audience. Take the case of COVID-19, for example. To ascertain the possible confounding factor of  population density, you need to know how the virus spreads, which falls into the domain  of epidemiology. The first question you need to ask is whether there is a more science- based explanation. During the process of finding such an explanation, you need to learn  domain knowledge and can often easily poke a hole in the false arguments.  Proving causal relations scientifically Proving a causal relation between variables is hard, but to fake one is quite  easy. In a rigorous academic research environment, to prove a cause and effect  relationship, you need to control variables that leave the target variable as  being the only explanation of the observed behavior. Often, such experiments  must have the ability to be reproduced in other labs with different groups of  researchers. However, this is sometimes hard, or even impossible, to reproduce  in the case of social science research.  A second great way of refuting such false arguments is to gather opinions from credible  experts. A credible expert is someone who has verifiable knowledge and experience in  specific domains that is trustworthy. As the saying goes, given enough eyes on the codes,  there won't be any bugs. Seeking opinions from true experts will often easily reveal the  fallacy in false causal arguments. In your data science team, pair coding and coding reviews will help you to detect errors,  including, but not limited to, causal relation arguments. An even better way to do this is  to show your work to the world – put your code on GitHub or build a website to show  it to anyone on the internet. This is how academic publishing works, and includes two  important elements—peer review and open access to other researchers.   Summary     335  Summary In this chapter, we discussed three best practices in data science. They are also three  warnings I give to you: always be cautious about data quality; always be vigilant about  visualization; and pay more attention to detect  and thereby help avoid  false cause and  effect relationship claims.  In the next and final chapter of this book, we will use what you have learned so far to solve  the exercises and problems.    13  Exercises and  Projects  This chapter is dedicated to exercises and projects that will enhance your understanding of  statistics, as well as your practical programming skills.  This chapter contains three sections. The first section contains exercises that are direct  derivatives of the code examples you saw throughout this book. The second section  contains some projects I would recommend you try out; some of these will be partially  independent of what we covered concretely in previous chapters. The last section is for  those of you who want to dive more into the theory and math aspects of this book. Each  section is organized according to the contents of the corresponding chapter.  Once you've finished this final chapter, you will be able to do the following:     Reinforce your basic knowledge about the concepts and knowledge points that were   covered in this book     Gain working experience of a project's life cycle    Understand the math and theoretical foundations at a higher level  Let's get started!   338     Exercises and Projects  Note on the usage of this chapter You are not expected to read or use this chapter sequentially. You may use this  chapter to help you review the topics that were covered in a certain chapter  once you've finished it. You can also use it as reference for your data scientist  interview.  Exercises Most of the exercises in each chapter don't depend on each other. However, if the exercises  do depend on each other, this relationship will be stated clearly.  Chapter 1 – Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning,  and Preprocessing Exercises related to Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and  Preprocessing, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Loading data Load the auto-mpg data as a pandas DataFrame by using the pandas.read_csv    function. This data can be found at https:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml  machine-learning-databases auto-mpg .  Hint You may find that the default argument fails to load the data properly. Search  the document of the read_csv   function, identify the problem, and find  the solution.  Exercise 2 – Preprocessing Once you've loaded the auto-mpg data, preprocess the data like so:  Identify the type of each column feature as numerical or categorical.  1.  2.  Perform min-max scaling for the numerical variables. 3.   Impute the data with the median value.   Hint This dataset, which I chose on purpose, can be ambiguous in terms of  determining the variable type. Think about different choices and their possible  consequences for downstream tasks.  Exercises     339  Exercise 3 – Pandas and API calling Sign up for a free account at https:  openweathermap.org api, obtain an API  key, and read the API documentation carefully. Make some API calls to obtain the hourly  temperature for the city you live in for the next 24 hours. Build a pandas DataFrame and  plot a time versus temperature graph.  Hint You may need Python's datetime module to convert a string into a valid  datetime object.  Chapter 2 – Essential Statistics for Data Assessment Exercises related to Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, are listed in   this section.  Exercise 1 – Other definitions of skewness There are several different definitions of skewness. Use the data that we used to examine  skewness in Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for Data Assessment, to calculate the following  versions of skewness according to Wikipedia  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Skewness :     Pearson's second skewness coefficient    Quantile-based measures    Groeneveld and Meeden's coefficient  Exercise 2 – Bivariate statistics Load the auto-mpg dataset that we introduced in Exercise 1 – Loading data, for Chapter  1,  Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning and Preprocessing. Identify the bivariate  correlation with all the numerical variables. Which variables are positively correlated, and  which ones are negatively correlated? Do these correlations make real-life sense to you?   340     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 3 – The crosstab   function Can you implement your own crosstab   function? It can take two lists of equal length  as input and generate a DataFrame as output. You can also set an optional parameter,  such as the name of the input lists.  Hint Use the zip   function for a one-pass loop.  Chapter 3 – Visualization with Statistical Graphs Exercises related to Chapter 3, Visualization with Statistical Graphs, are listed in   this section.  Exercise 1 – Identifying the components This is an open question. Try to identify the three components shown on Seaborn's  gallery page: https:  seaborn.pydata.org examples index.html. The three  components of any statistical graph are data, geometry, and aesthetics. You may encounter  new kinds of graph types here, which makes this a great opportunity to learn!  Exercise 2 – Query-oriented transformation Use the auto-mpg data we introduced in Exercise 1 – Loading data, for Chapter 1,  Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning and Preprocessing, transform it into the long  format, and generate a boxplot called the Seaborn tips boxplot. Namely, you want the  x-axis to be the cylinders variable and the y-axis to be the mpg data.  Exercise 3 – Overlaying two graphs For the birth rate and death rate of the Anderson county, overlay the line plot and the bar  plot in the same graph.  Some possible enhancements you can make here are as follows:     Choose a proper font and indicate the value of the data with numbers.    Choose different symbols for the death rate and the birth rate.   Exercises     341  Exercise 4 – Layout Create a 2x2 layout and create a scatter plot of the birth rate and death rate of your   four favorite states in the US. Properly set the opacity and marker size so that it is   visually appealing.  Exercise 5 – The pairplot   function The pairplot   function of the seaborn library is a very powerful function. Use it to  visualize all the numerical variables of the auto-mpg dataset we introduced in Exercise 1 –  Loading data, of Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning and Preprocessing.  Study its documentation so that you know how to add a regression line to the off-diagonal  plots. Does the regression line make sense to you? Compare the result with the correlation  result you obtained in Exercise 2 – Bivariate statistics, of Chapter 2, Essential Statistics for  Data Assessment.  Hint Read the documentation regarding pairplot   for more information:  https:  seaborn.pydata.org generated seaborn. pairplot.html.  Chapter 4 – Sampling and Inferential Statistics Exercises related to Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Simple sampling with replacement Create a set of data that follows a standard normal distribution of size 1,000. Run simple  random sampling with and without replacement. Increase the sampling size. What  happens if the sampling size of your replacement sampling exceeds 1,000?   Exercise 2 – Stratified sampling Run stratified sampling on the population of county, stratified with respect to states rather  than rural-urban Continuum Code_2013. Sample two data points from each state and  compare the results by running the sampling multiple times.   342     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 3 – Central limit theorem Verify the central limit theorem by summing non-normal random variables by following  the distributions listed here  just pick the easiest form for each . If you are not familiar  with these distributions, please refer to Chapter 5, Common Probability Distributions:     Binomial distribution    Uniform distribution    Poisson distribution    Exponential distribution  Can you visually examine the number of random variables that need to be summed  together to approach a normal distribution for each of the aforementioned distributions?  What is the intuition behind your observation?  Chapter 5 – Common Probability Distributions Exercises related to Chapter 5, Common Probability Distributions, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Identify the sample space and the event corresponding  to the probability being asked in the following statements:     By tossing four fair coins, find the probability of at least getting two heads.    The probability that a bus arrives between 8:00 A.M. and 8:30 A.M.    A battleship fires three missiles. The battleship's target will be destroyed if at least   two missiles hit its target. Find the probability that the battleship's target will   be destroyed.     Assume that the likelihood of a woman giving birth to a boy or a girl are the same.   If we know a family that has three kids has a girl in the family, find the probability  that the family has at least one girl. How about the probability of having at least   a boy?  Exercise 2 – Proof of probability equations Prove the following equation:     𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∪𝐵𝐵 =𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴 +𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵 −𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵     Exercises     343  Hint Enumerate all possibilities of both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of  the equation. Prove that if an event is in the left-hand side – that is, the union  of A and B – then it is in the expression of the right-hand side. In the same  regard, if it is in the right-hand side, then prove it is also in the left-hand side.  Exercise 3 – Proof of De Morgan's law De Morgan's law states two important transformation rules, as stated here: https:   en.wikipedia.org wiki De_Morgan%27s_laws. Use the same technique   you used in the previous exercise to prove them.  Exercise 4 – Three dice sum Write a program that calculates the distribution in a sum of three fair dice. Write   a program that will simulate the case where the dice are not fair so that for each dice,   it is two times more likely to have an even outcome than an odd outcome.   Hint  Write some general simulation code so that you can specify the probability  associated with each face of the dice and the total number of dice. Then,   you are free to recover the central limit theorem easily.  Exercise 5 – Approximate the binomial distribution with the Poisson  distribution The binomial distribution with a large n can sometimes be very difficult to calculate  because of the involvement of factorials. However, you can approximate this with Poisson  distribution. The condition for this is as follows:     n→ ∞     p→0     np→λ , where λ is a constant  If all three conditions are met, then the binomial distribution can be approximated by the  Poisson distribution with the corresponding parameter, λ. Prove this visually. Most of the time, n must be larger than 100 and p must be smaller   than 0.01.   344     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 6 – Conditional distribution for a discrete case In the following table, the first column indicates the grades of all the students in an  English class, while the first row indicates the math grades for the same class. The values  shown are the count of students and the corresponding students:  Answer the following questions. Some of these question descriptions are quite  complicated, so read them carefully:  Figure 13.1 – Scores      What is the probability of a randomly selected student having a B in math?    What is the probability of a randomly selected student having a math grade that's no   worse than a C and an English grade that's no worse than a B?     If we know that a randomly selected student has a D in math, what's the probability   that this student has no worse than a B in English?     What's the minimal math grade a randomly selected student should have where    you have the confidence to say that this student has at least a 70% chance of having  no worse than a B in English?  Chapter 6 – Parameter Estimation Exercises related to Chapter 6, Parameter Estimation, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Distinguishing between estimation and prediction Which of the following scenarios belong to the estimation process and which belong to  the prediction process?     Find out the weather next week.    Find out the battery capacity of your phone based on your usage profile.    Find out the arrival time of the next train based on the previous trains' arrival time.   Exercises     345  Exercise 2 – Properties of estimators If you were to use the method of moments to estimate a uniform distribution's  boundaries, is the estimator that's obtained unbiased? Is the estimator that's   obtained consistent?  Exercise 3 – Method of moments Randomly generate two variables between 0 and 1 without checking their values. Set them  as the μ and σ of a Gaussian random distribution. Generate 1,000 samples and use the  method of moments to estimate these two variables. Do they agree?  Exercise 4 – Maximum likelihood – I We toss a coin 100 times and for 60 cases we get heads. It's possible for the coin to be  either fair, or biased to getting heads with a probability of 70%. Which is more likely?  Exercise 5 – Maximum likelihood – II In this chapter, we discussed an example in which we used normal distribution or  Laplace distribution to model the noise in a dataset. What if the noise follows a uniform  distribution between -1 and 1? What result will be yielded? Does it make sense?  Exercise 6 – Law of total probability Let's say the weather tomorrow has a 40% chance of being windy and a 60% chance of  being sunny. On a windy day, you have a 50% chance of going hiking, while on a sunny  day, the probability goes up to 80%. What's the probability of you going hiking tomorrow  without knowing tomorrow's weather? What about after knowing that it's 90% likely to be  sunny tomorrow?  Exercise 7 – Monty Hall question calculation  Calculate the quantity, 𝑃𝑃 𝐶𝐶𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵  , that we left in the Monty Hall question. Check its value   with the provided answer.   346     Exercises and Projects Chapter 7 – Statistical Hypothesis Testing Exercises related to Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – One-tailed and two-tailed tests Is the following statement correct? The significant level for a one-tailed test will be twice as large as it is for the two-tailed test.   Exercise 2 – P-value concept – I Is the following statement correct? For a discrete random variable where every outcome shares an equal probability, any  outcome has a P-value of 1.  Exercise 3 – P-value concept – II Are the following statements correct?     The value of the P-value is obtained by assuming the null hypothesis is correct.     The P-value, by definition, has a false-positive ratio.   Hint  False-positive naively means something isn't positive but you misclassify   or mistreat it as being positive.  Exercise 4 – Calculating the P-value Calculate the P-value of observing five heads when tossing an independent fair coin   six times.  Exercise 5 – Table looking Find the corresponding value in a one-tailed t-distribution table where the degree   of freedom is 5 and the significance level is 0.002.  Exercise 6 – Decomposition of variance Prove the following formula mathematically:  𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇2=𝑆𝑆𝐵𝐵2+𝑆𝑆𝑊𝑊2     Exercise 7 – Fisher's exact test For the link-clicking example we discussed in this chapter, read through the Fisher's exact  test page: https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Fisher%27s_exact_test. Run   a Fisher's exact test on the device and browser variables.  Exercises     347  Hint  Build a crosstab first. It may be easier to refer to the accompanying notebook  for reusable code.  Exercise 8 – Normality test with central limit theorem In Exercise 3 – Central limit theorem, of Chapter 4, Sampling and Inferential Statistics, we  tested the central limit theorem visually. In this exercise, use the normality test provided  in Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, to test the normality of the random variable  that was generated from summing non-normal random variables.  Exercise 9 – Goodness of fit* In Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, we ran a goodness of fit test on the casino  card game data. Now, let's assume the number of hearts no longer follows a binomial  distribution, but a Poisson distribution. Now, run a goodness of fit test by doing the  following:  1.  Find the most likely parameter for the Poisson distribution by maximizing the   likelihood function.  2.  Run the goodness of fit test.  Suggestion This question is a little tricky. You may need to review the procedure of  building and maximizing a likelihood function to complete this exercise.   Exercise 10 – Stationary test* Find the data for the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States from the date  when the first death happened to July 29th, where the number of patients that died had  reached 150,000. Run a stationary test on the data and the first difference of the data.   348     Exercises and Projects Chapter 8 – Statistics for Regression Exercises related to Chapter 8, Statistics for Regression, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – R-squared Are the following statements correct?     A bigger R2 is always a good indicator of good fit for a single-variable linear model.    For a multivariable linear model, an adjusted R2 is a better choice when evaluating   the quality of the model.  Exercise 2 – Polynomial regression Is the following statement correct? To run a regression variable, y, over single variable, x, an 8th order polynomial can fit an  arbitrary dataset of size 8. If yes, why?  Exercise 3 – Doubled R2 Is the following statement correct? If a regression model has an R2 of 0.9, suppose we obtained another set of data that  happens to match the original dataset exactly, similar to a duplicate. What will happen to  the regression coefficients? What will happen to the R2?  Exercise 4 – Linear regression on the auto-mpg dataset Run simple linear regression on the auto-mpg dataset. Obtain the coefficients between the  make year and mpg variables. Try to do this by using different methods, as we did in the  example provided in this chapter.  Exercise 5 – Collinearity Run multivariable linear regression to fit the mpg in the auto-mpg dataset to the rest of the  numerical variables. Are the other variables highly collinear? Calculate VIF to eliminate  two variables and run the model again. Is the adjusted R^2 decreasing or increasing?   Exercises     349  Exercise 6 – Lasso regression and ridge regression Repeat Exercise 5 – Collinearity, but this time with lasso regularization or ridge  regularization. Change the regularization coefficient to control the strength of the  regularization and plot a set of line plots regarding the regularization parameter   versus the coefficient magnitude.  Chapter 9 – Statistics for Classification Exercises related to Chapter 9, Statistics for Classification, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Odds and log of odds Determine the correctness of the following statements:     The odds of an event can take any value between 0 and infinity.    The log of odds has the meaning as a probability.  Hint Plot the relationship between the probability and the log of odds.  Exercise 2 – Confusion matrix Determine the proper quadrant for the following scenarios in the coefficient matrix:     Diagnose a man as pregnant.    If there are incoming planes and the detector failed to find them.    A COVID-19 patient was correctly diagnosed as positive.  Exercise 3 –  F1 score Calculate the F1 score for the following confusion matrix:  Figure 13.2 – Confusion matrix   350     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 4 – Grid search for optimal logistic regression coefficients When we maximized the loglikelihood function of the stock prediction example,   I suggested that you use grid search to find the optimal set of slopes and intercepts.   Write a function that will find the optimal values and compare them with the ones   I provided there.  Exercise 5 –  The linregress   function Use the linregress   function to run linear regression on the Netflix stock data. Then,  verify the R2 value's agreement with our manually calculated values.  Exercise 6 – Insufficient data issue with the Bayes classifier For a naïve Bayes classifier, if the data is categorical and there's not enough of it, we may  encounter an issue where the prediction encounters a tie between two or even more  possibilities. For the stroke risk prediction example, verify that the following data gives   us an undetermined prediction:  {"weight":"high","high_oil_diet":"no","smoking":"no"}  Exercise 7 – Laplace smoothing One solution for solving the insufficient data problem is to use Laplace smoothing, also  known as additive smoothing. Please read the wiki page at https:  en.wikipedia. org wiki Additive_smoothing and the lecture note from Toronto university  at http:  www.cs.toronto.edu ~bonner courses 2007s csc411  lectures 03bayes.zemel.pdf before re-solving the issue that was raised in  Exercise 4 – Grid search for optimal logistic regression coefficients.  Exercise 8 – Cross-validation For the auto-mpg data we introduced in Exercise 1 – Loading data, of Chapter 1,  Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing, use 5-fold cross-validation  to train multivariable linear regression models and evaluate their performance using the  mean squared error metric.   Exercises     351  Exercise 9 – ROC curve One important concept I skipped due to space limitations is the ROC curve. However,  it is easy to replicate. For the stock prediction logistic regression model, pick a series  of equally spaced thresholds between 0 and 1, and then create a scatter plot of the true  positive rates and the true positive rates. Examine the result. What you will have obtained  is an ROC curve. You can find more information about the ROC curve at https:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Receiver_operating_characteristic.  Exercise 10 – Predicting cylinders Use the mpg, horsepower, and displacement variables of the auto-mpg dataset  to classify the cylinder variable using a Gaussian Naïve classifier. Check out the  documentation at https:  scikit-learn.org stable modules naive_ bayes.htmlgaussian-naive-bayes to find out more.  Hint  Gaussian Naïve Bayes is the continuous version of the categorical Naïve Bayes  method. However, it is not the only option. Feel free to explore other Naïve  Bayes classifiers and compare their performance. You are also permitted  to remove odd-number cylinder samples since they are very rare and not  informative in general.  Chapter 10 – Statistics for Tree-Based Methods Exercises related to Chapter 10, Statistics for Tree-Based Methods, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Tree concepts Determine the correctness of the following statements:     A tree can only have a single root node.    A decision node can only have, at most, two child nodes.    A node can only have one parent node.   352     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 2 – Gini impurity visualized For a three-category dataset with categories A, B, and C, produce a 2D visualization of the   Gini impurity as a function of 𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴   and 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵  , where 0 <𝑃𝑃 𝐴𝐴  + 𝑃𝑃 𝐵𝐵  < 1 .  Hint  Although we have three categories, the requirement of summing to one leaves  us with two degrees of freedom.  Exercise 3 – Comparing Gini impurity with entropy Another criterion for tree node splitting is known as entropy. Read the Wikipedia page  at https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Entropy_ information_theory   and write functions that will help you redo Exercise 2 – Gini impurity revisited, but with  entropy being used instead. What do you find? In terms of splitting nodes, which method  is more aggressive conservative? What if you increase the number of possible categories?  Can you perform a Monte Carlo simulation?  Exercise 4 – Entropy-based tree building Use entropy instead of Gini impurity to rebuild the stroke risk decision tree.  Exercise 5 – Non-binary tree Without grouping low-risk and middle-risk groups, build a three-category decision   tree from scratch for the stroke risk dataset. You can use either Gini impurity or entropy  for this.  Exercise 6 – Regression tree concepts Determine the correctness of the following statements:     The number of possible outputs a regression tree has is the same as the number of   partitions it has for the feature space.     Using absolute error rather than MSE will yield the same partition result.    To split over a continuous variable, the algorithm has to try all possible values, so  for each splitting, the time complexity of the naïve approach will be O NM , where  N is the number of continuous features and M is the number of samples in the node.   Exercises     353  Exercise 7 – Efficiency of regression tree building Write some pseudocode to demonstrate how the tree partition process can be paralleled.   If you can't, please explain which step or steps prohibit this.  Exercise 8 – sklearn example Use sklearn to build a regression tree that predicts the value of mpg in the auto-mpg  dataset with the rest of the features. Then, build a classification tree that predicts the  number of cylinders alongside the rest of the features.  Exercise 9 – Overfitting and pruning* This is a hard question that may involve higher coding requirements. The sklearn API provides a parameter that helps us control the depth of the tree, which  prevents overfitting. Another way we can do this is to build the tree so that it's as deep   as needed first, then prune the tree backward from the leaves. Can you implement   a helper utility function to achieve this? You may need to dive into the details of the  DecisionTreeClassifier   class to directly manipulate the tree object.  Chapter 11 – Statistics for Ensemble Methods Exercises related to Chapter 11, Statistics for Ensemble Methods, are listed in this section.  Exercise 1 – Bias-variance trade-off concepts Determine the correctness of the following statements:     Train set and test set splitting will prevent both underfitting and overfitting.    Non-randomized sampling will likely cause overfitting.    Variance in terms of the concept of bias-variance trade-off means the variance    of the model, not the variance of the data.  Exercise 2 – Bootstrapping concept Determine the correctness of the following statements. If there is any ambiguity, please  illustrate your answer s  with examples:     The bigger the variance of the sample data, the more performant bootstrapping    will be.     Bootstrapping doesn't generate new information from the original dataset.    354     Exercises and Projects  Exercise 3 – Bagging concept Determine the correctness of the following statements:    Each aggregated weak learner is the same weight.    BaggingClassifier   can be set so that it's trained in parallel.    The differences between weak learners are caused by the differences in the sampled   data that they are exposed to.  Exercise 4 – From using a bagging tree classifier to random forests* You may have heard about random forests before. They are tree-based machine learning  models that are known for their robustness to overfitting. The key difference between  bagging decision trees and random forests is that a random forest not only samples the  records, but also samples the features. For example, let's say we're performing a regression  task where we're using the auto-mpg dataset. Here, the cylinder feature may not be  available during one iteration of the node splitting process. Implement your own simple random forest class. Compare its performance with the  sklearn bagging classifier.   Exercise 5 – Boosting concepts Determine the correctness of the following statements:    In principle, boosting is not trainable in parallel.    Boosting, in principle, can decrease the bias of the training set indefinitely.    Boosting linear weak learners is not efficient because the linear combinations of a   linear model is also a linear model.  Exercise 6 – AdaBoost Use AdaBoost to predict the number of cylinders in the auto-mpg dataset against the rest  of the variables.   Exercise 7 – Gradient boosting tree visualization Using the tree visualization code that was introduced in Chapter 12, Statistics for Tree- Based Methods, visualize the decision rules of the weak learners trees for a gradient  descent model. Select trees from the first 10 iterations, first 40 iterations, and then every  100 iterations. Do you notice any patterns?   Project suggestions     355  Everything up to this point has all been exercises I've prepared for you. The next section is  dedicated to the projects you can carry out. Each project is associated with a chapter and  a topic, but it's recommended that you integrate these projects to build a comprehensive  project that you can show to future employers.  Project suggestions These projects will be classified into three different categories, as listed here:     Elementary projects: Elementary projects are ones where you only need knowledge   from one or two chapters and are easy to complete. Elementary projects only  require that you have basic Python programming skills.     Comprehensive projects: Comprehensive projects are ones that require you to   review knowledge from several chapters. Having a thorough understanding   of the example code provided in this book is required to complete a   comprehensive project.  Capstone projects: Capstone projects are projects that involve almost all the  contents of this book. In addition to the examples provided in this book, you are  expected to learn a significant amount of new knowledge and programming skills to  complete the task at hand.      Let's get started!  Non-tabular data This is an elementary project. The knowledge points in this project can be found in  Chapter 1, Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing, and Chapter 2,  Essential Statistics for Data Assessment. The university dataset in the UCI machine learning repository is stored in a non-tabular  format: https:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml datasets University. Please  examine its format and perform the following tasks:  1.  Examine the data format visually and then write down some patterns to see whether   such patterns can be used to extract the data at specific lines.  2.  Write a function that will systematically read the data file and store the data   contained within in a pandas DataFrame.  3.  The data description mentioned the existence of both missing data and duplicate   data. Identify the missing data and deduplicate the duplicated data.   356     Exercises and Projects  4.  Classify the features into numerical features and categorical features. 5.  Apply min-max normalization to all the numerical variables. 6.  Apply median imputation to the missing data.  Non-tabular format Legacy data may be stored in non-tabular format for historical reasons. The  format the university data is stored in is a LISP-readable format, which is a  powerful old programming language that was invented more than 60 years ago.  Real-time weather data This is a comprehensive project. The knowledge points are mainly from Chapter 1,  Fundamentals of Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing, and Chapter 3, Visualization  with Statistical Graphs. The free weather API provides current weather data for more than 200,000 cities in the  world. You can apply for a free trial here: https:  openweathermap.org api. In  this example, you will build a visualization of the temperature for major US cities. Refer to  the following instructions:  1.  Read the API documentation for the current endpoint: https:    openweathermap.org current. Write some short scripts to test the validity of  your API key by querying the current weather in New York. If you don't have one,  apply for a free trial.  2.  Write another function that will parse the returned data into tabular format. 3.  Query the current weather in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Denver as well.   You may want to store their zip codes in a dictionary for reference. Properly set the  fonts, legends, and size of markers. The color of the line will be determined by the  main field of the returned JSON object. You are encouraged to choose a color map  that associates warmer colors with higher temperatures, for example.  4.  Write another function that re-queries the weather information in each city and   re-plots the visualization every 20 minutes.   Real-time weather data     357  Colormap In data science-related visualization, a colormap is a mapping from ordered  quantities or indices to an array of colors. Different colormaps significantly  change the feeling of viewers. For more information, please refer to  https:  matplotlib.org 3.1.1 tutorials colors  colormaps.html.  I also pointed out the main field in the returned JSON for you:  Figure 13.3 – The main field of the returned json object  We will use the functions and code you developed in this project for a capstone project,  later in this chapter. The rest of this project is quite flexible and up to you.   358     Exercises and Projects Goodness of fit for discrete distributions This is an elementary project. The topics involved are from Chapter 3, Visualization with  Statistical Graphs, to Chapter 7, Statistical Hypothesis Testing. The description is fancy, but  you should be able to divide it into small parts. This is also a project where many details  are ambiguous, and you should define your own questions specifically. In this project, you will write a "bot" that can guess the parameters of discrete  distributions. You also need to visualize this process. Suppose there is a program that randomly selects integer λ from the list [5,10,20] first,  then generates Poisson-distributed samples based on the pre-generated λ. The program  will also recreate λ after generating n samples, where n is another random integer variable  that's uniformly distributed between 500 and 600. By doing this, you will have obtained 100,000 data points generated by this program.  Write a function that will calculate the possibilities of λ behind every data point. Then,  visualize this. You can approach this problem by using the following instructions:  1.  First, you need to clarify the definition. Let's say you can calculate the goodness   of fit test's P-value and then use this P-value to indicate how likely a specific λ  is for the parameter of a distribution. You can also calculate the likelihoods and  compare them. The point is that you need to define quantities that can describe  the ambiguous term possibilities in the question. This is up to you, but I used the  goodness of fit test as an example.  2.  Then, you should write a program that will generate 100,000 pieces of data.  3.  Next, define a window size. The window will be moved to capture the data and run   the goodness of fit test on the windowed data. Choose a window size and justify  your choice. What's the problem with a window size being too small and what's the  problem with a window size being too large?  4.  Calculate the P-values for the goodness of fit results. Plot them along with the   original data. Choose your aesthetics wisely.  The idea behind this exercise There are many observations that can be modeled as a process that's controlled  by a hidden parameter. It's key to model such a process and determine the  parameter s . In this project, you already know that the mechanism behind the  random variable generation is a Poisson process, but in most cases, you won't  know this. This project is a simplified scenario.   Real-time weather data     359  Building a weather prediction web app This is a capstone project. To complete this project, you should get your hands on the Dash framework: https:   dash-gallery.plotly.host Portal . Dash is a framework that you can use to  quickly turn a Python script into a deployable data science application. You should at  least go over the first four sessions of the tutorial and focus on the Dash map demo to  learn how to render maps: https:  dash-gallery.plotly.host dash-mapd- demo . To finish this project, follow these steps:  1.  Finish the prerequisite mentioned in the project description. 2.  Write a function that will map a list of city zip codes to markers on a US map and  render them. Learn how to change the contents on the map when hovering over it  with your mouse.   3.  Use the weather API to obtain a weather report for the last 7 days for the major   cities we listed in earlier projects. Build a linear regressor that will predict the  temperature for the following data. Write a function that will automate this step so  that every time you invoke the function, new data will be queried.  4.  Design a layout where the page is split into two parts. 5.  The left panel should be a map where each city is highlighted with today's   temperature value.  6.  The right panel should be a line chart where regression is performed so   that tomorrow's temperature is predicted and distinguished from known   previous temperature.  7.  This step is optional*. You are encouraged to use other machine learning    algorithms rather than simple linear regression to allow the users to switch between   different algorithms. For example, you can use both simple linear regression and   regression trees.   8.  To train a regression tree, you might need more historical data. Explore the API   options and give it a try.  9.  You need a UI component to allow the users to change between algorithms. The  toggle button may be what you need: https:  dash.plotly.com dash- daq toggleswitch.   360     Exercises and Projects  This project is particularly useful because as a data scientist, an interactive app is probably  the best way to demonstrate your skills in terms of both statistics and programming. The  last project is similar in this regard.  Building a typing suggestion app This is a capstone project. In this project, you are going to build a web app that predicts  what the user's typing by training them on large word corpus. There are three components  in this app, but they are not strongly correlated. You can start from any of them:     Processing word data: The typing suggestion is based on Bayes' theorem, where the  most likely or top-k predictions are made by examining a large set of sentences. You  can obtain an English text corpus from the English Corpora website: https:   www.english-corpora.org history.asp. You can start from a small  corpus, such as the manually annotated sub-corpus project: http:  www.anc. org data masc downloads data-download . You need to tokenize the  data by sequencing words. You are encouraged to start with tutorials from SpaCy   or NLTK. You should find material online, such as https:  realpython.com  natural-language-processing-spacy-python , to help with this.     Building the model: You need to build a two-gram model, which means counting  the number of appearances of neighboring word pairs. For example, "I eat" is likely  to be more frequent than "I fly", so the word "eat" will be more likely to show up  than "fly". You need to create a model or module that can perform such a task  quickly. Also, you may want to save your data in a local disk persistently so that   you don't need to run the model building process every time your app starts.     Building the app: The last step is to create a UI. The documentation for the input  component can be found here: https:  dash.plotly.com dash-core- components input. You need to decide on how you want your user to see your  suggestions. You can achieve this by creating a new UI component.   One additional feature you may wish to add to your app is a spam filter. By doing this,   you can inform your user of how likely the input text looks like a spam message in   real time.   Further reading With that, you have reached the last part of this book. In this section, I am going to  recommend some of the best books on data science, statistics, and machine learning  I've found, all of which can act as companions to this book. I have grouped them into  categories and shared my personal thoughts on them.   Further reading     361  Textbooks Books that fall into this category are read like textbooks and are often used as textbooks   or at least reference books in universities. Their quality has been proven and their value   is timeless. The first one is Statistical Inference by George Casella, 2nd Edition, which book covers the  first several chapters of this book. It contains a multitude of useful exercises and practices,  all of which are explained in detail. It is hard to get lost when reading this book. The second book is The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani,  and Jerome Friedman, 2nd Edition. This book is the bible of traditional statistical learning.  It's not easy for beginners who are not comfortable with the conciseness of math proof.  There is another book, An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Application in R by  Gareth James and Daniela Witten, that is simpler and easier to digest. Both books cover all  the topics in this book starting from Chapter 6, Parametric Estimation.  Visualization The first book I recommend about visualization is The Visual Display of Quantitative  Information by Edward R. Tufte. This book will not teach you how to code or plot a real  visualization, instead teaching you the philosophy surrounding visualization. The second book I recommend is also by Edward R. Tufte. It is called Visual and Statistical  Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions. It contains many examples where  visualizations are done correctly and incorrectly. It is also very entertaining to read. I won't recommend any specific books that dedicate full content to coding examples for  visualization here. The easiest way to learn about visualization is by referring to this book's  GitHub repository and replicating the examples provided. Of course, it would be great if  you were to get a hard copy so that you can look up information quickly and review   it frequently.  Exercising your mind This category contains books that don't read like textbooks but also require significant  effort to read, think about, and digest. The first book is Common Errors in Statistics  and How to Avoid Them  by Phillip I. Good  and James W. Hardin. This book contains concepts surrounding the usage of visualizations  that are widely misunderstood.    362     Exercises and Projects  The second book is Stat Labs: Mathematical Statistics Through Applications  Springer Texts  in Statistics  by Deborah Nolan and Terry P. Speed. This book is unique because it starts  every topic with real-world data and meaningful questions that should be asked. You will  find that this book's reading difficulty increases quickly. I highly recommend this book.  You may need to use a pen and paper to perform any calculations and tabulation that's  required of you.   Summary Congratulations on reaching the end of this book! In this chapter, we introduced exercises  and projects of varying difficulty. You were also provided with a list of additional books  that will help you as you progress through the exercises and projects mentioned in this  chapter. I hope these additional materials will boost your statistical learning progress and  make you an even better data scientist.

Statistics remain the backbone of modern analysis tasks, helping you to interpret the results produced by data science pipelines. This book is a detailed guide covering the math and various statistical methods required for undertaking data science tasks. The book starts by showing you how to preprocess data and inspect distributions and correlations from a statistical perspective. You'll then get to grips with the fundamentals of statistical analysis and apply its concepts to real-world datasets. As you advance, you'll find out how statistical concepts emerge from different stages of data science pipelines, understand the summary of datasets in the language of statistics, and use it to build a solid foundation for robust data products such as explanatory models and predictive models. Once you've uncovered the working mechanism of data science algorithms, you'll cover essential concepts for efficient data collection, cleaning, mining, visualization, and analysis. Finally, you'll implement statistical methods in key machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, tree-based methods, and ensemble learning
