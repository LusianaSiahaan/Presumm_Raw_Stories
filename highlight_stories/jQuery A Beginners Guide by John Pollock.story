Several years ago, I noticed that there was a   new popular term emerging on the Web: jQuery. Of course, I got curious and decided   to go find out what this meant.  I quickly found out that this was a JavaScript library, but not just any library. This one   provided the means to easily select elements and create dynamic effects with less code being  required from the developer. Not only that, it also turned many of the cross-browser worries  often encountered in JavaScript code into things that developers didn’t need to pull their hair  out about any more when using the library: It provided support even for older versions of  Internet Explorer!  After seeing this, I felt this would be a helpful library to use when I needed to complete   a JavaScript program that required support for older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6.  Rather than worrying about the additional coding that would be needed to make the program  compatible, the program could simply be written while jQuery made it consistent with each  browser in the background. This made jQuery the perfect choice as my first library to learn in  detail.  xvii   xviii  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Why This Book?  Learning a new language or API  application programming interface  can be difficult even  when great documentation is available. Many times, it is helpful to have a gentle introduction  to the topic, especially if one is unfamiliar with the terms and practices that are used when  talking about it. This book is designed to guide beginners to jQuery JavaScript so that they can  get started easily and learn all of the terms that will be needed to understand the topic fully.  Web designers, Web developers, or JavaScript programmers who want to learn to use   jQuery from the beginning will find this a good place to start. With a gentle introduction and  explanation of the terms often used, this guide provides a means for beginners to start using the  jQuery library.  What This Book Covers  This book covers the basics of adding the jQuery library, element selection, event handling,  animation, form validation, AJAX, use and creation of plugins, and more, and includes special  features to help you along the way as you learn. These include  ● Key Skills & Concepts Each chapter begins with a set of key skills and concepts that   outline the topics you will want to understand by the end of the chapter.  ● Code Code listings display the source code used with each example.  ● Callouts Callouts point to specific lines or sections of code and provide helpful hints or   notes about the code.  ● Notes, Tips, and Cautions Notes, Tips, and Cautions call your attention to noteworthy   statements that you will find helpful as you move through the chapters.  ● Ask the Expert The Ask the Expert sections let you see what types of questions are   commonly asked about certain topics, with responses from the author.  ● Try This These sections get you to practice what you have learned using a hands-on   approach.

You’ve probably heard the word jQuery  numerous times by now, and perhaps you’ve even been told you need to learn it for   your job. This chapter discusses the things you should know before starting with jQuery, what  jQuery is, and how to begin using it in your Web site code.  jQuery has become an immensely popular tool for adding dynamic effects to Web pages,   such as adding, removing, or moving elements. It uses a syntax that is often easier to learn than  JavaScript programming, since it makes use of HTML CSS syntax as a basis for accessing  page elements. This syntax is something most Web designers and developers are familiar with  already, which is a nice feature when you are learning something new.  What You Need to Know  Before you begin using jQuery, you should have  or obtain  knowledge of the following:   ● HTML and Cascading Style Sheets  CSS    ● Text editors and Web browsers   ● Basic JavaScript  If you have been asked to learn jQuery, you likely have some or all of this knowledge   already. If you don’t know some or all of the aforementioned topics, a closer look at each of  them may help you decide where to begin. Basic HTML and CSS Knowledge Ideally, you will want to have previous experience with HTML  Hypertext Markup Language   and CSS  Cascading Style Sheets , or at least have a basic understanding of how these  languages work and how they help to build a Web page.   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  3  You will use HTML to create the structure of a Web page, and you will be adding,   changing, or removing tags during the course of this book. For this reason, it is good to know  the basics regarding the opening and closing of tags and how to add attributes to tags, as in the  following code:     If you don’t know HTML, you can learn it fairly quickly by purchasing a book or reading   a Web site. A good book is HTML: A Beginner’s Guide, Fourth Edition by Wendy Willard   McGraw-Hill Professional, 2009 . For good Web sites to learn HTML, try: www.scripttheweb .com html5  and www.w3.org wiki The_basics_of_HTML.  In this book, I will use HTML5 in the example code. You are free to use HTML4 or   XHTML if necessary, or if you prefer to do so. You will just need to adjust the code as needed  to fit the convention you will be using.  You will also need to know how to use CSS, particularly when it comes to using CSS  selectors. Two good places to learn CSS are www.scripttheweb.com css  and www.w3.org  wiki CSS_basics. Basic Text Editor and Web Browser Knowledge Before jumping in and coding with JavaScript, you must be able to use a text editor or HTML  editor, and a Web browser. You’ll use these tools to code your scripts. Text Editors Any HTML text editor can be used for jQuery code, just as with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.  Some examples include Adobe Dreamweaver  in code mode , NetBeans, or a plain text editor  such as Notepad, TextPad, or Simple Text. Web Browsers jQuery is written to work in many different browsers, but the following are recommended since  they will be more up to date with other technologies  such as HTML5 or CSS3 :   ● Microsoft Internet Explorer version 9.0 or later, or 8 if you are not able to upgrade on your   operating system, for example, Windows XP  www.microsoft.com ie    ● Mozilla Firefox version 14.0 or later  www.mozilla.com firefox    ● Google Chrome version 20.0 or later  www.google.com chrome     ● Opera version 12.0 or later  www.opera.com   New versions of these browsers continue to be produced, so when you download one, be   sure to get the latest stable version available.  To give you an idea of what some of the aforementioned browsers look like when in use,   Figure 1-1 shows a Web page when viewed in Microsoft Internet Explorer, and Figure 1-2  shows the same page when viewed in Mozilla Firefox.   4  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 1-1 A Web page viewed in Microsoft Internet Explorer  Basic JavaScript Knowledge jQuery is a JavaScript library, so it is helpful to know some of the basics of the JavaScript  language, such as including JavaScript files in an HTML document, defining variables and  functions, using conditional statements, and working with the dot  .  operator.  While jQuery makes many things easier, it does not always entirely replace the use of  JavaScript code. For example, you may need to use an if else statement or define a variable  using JavaScript code. However, if you do not know these basics, I will provide some  assistance in this book when they come up, as well as provide references for further reading.  If you decide that you would like to learn the basics of JavaScript first, these resources can   help you:   ● JavaScript: A Beginner’s Guide, 4th Edition  McGraw-Hill Professional, 2013    ● www.scripttheweb.com js    ● https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US learn javascript   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  5  Figure 1-2    A Web page viewed in Mozilla Firefox  Since this is a beginner’s guide, I will try to integrate other technologies as gently as   possible into the text. However, if you don’t know the absolute basics  such as what an HTML  tag is , it will be best to begin by learning the basics of the topics using the resources provided  earlier in the chapter.  Ask the Expert Q: What exactly do I need to know about using a text editor? A: As long as you know how to edit and save plain text files with different file extensions, you  should have no problems. You will be using three different file extensions through this book   .html, .css, .js , which are typically included as options for you when you save your files in  a text or HTML editor.   continued    6  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Q: What do I need to know about using a browser? A: You should be able to open a local HTML file on your computer, open a page on the Web,  and reload a page. If you don’t know how to open a local HTML file, open your browser  and go to the File menu. Look for an option that says Open, Open File, or a similar phrase  and select it. You can then browse for and open the file you need. The following illustration  shows an example using Microsoft Internet Explorer:  Q: What if I don’t know some of the required technologies? A: Since this is a beginner’s guide, I will try to integrate other technologies as gently as   possible into the text. However, if you don’t know the absolute basics  such as what an  HTML tag is , it will be best to begin by learning the basics of the specific topic using the  resources provided earlier in the chapter.   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  7  Q: Since jQuery is a JavaScript library, can I just learn JavaScript instead? A: Ultimately, that is up to you. If you decide to use JavaScript instead, the resources presented  earlier in this chapter can help you learn it. jQuery, as you will see later in this chapter, makes  many of the difficult aspects of dealing with a document much easier for you  such as selecting  elements and making effects work cross-browser . Rather than needing to worry about what can  be done to make an effect work in Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and others,  you can simply write the jQuery code, which will handle the browser differences for you.  What Is jQuery?  Back in 2005, a programmer named John Resig came up with an idea that would streamline  code in JavaScript libraries by using CSS selectors as a basis for accessing elements in the  document and by creating syntax that would make event handling easier to implement. By  2006, he had implemented these ideas into his own JavaScript library, which was named  jQuery.  The first stable version was released that year, and since then the library has become   widely used by Web designers and developers all over the world. Additional features can be  added to the library through jQuery plugins, which can be found on the jQuery Web site. Over  the years, it has been optimized to be faster and more compact in order to help sites that use it  load more quickly. What Can jQuery Do? The jQuery library can perform numerous tasks with its user-friendly access to scripting,  including   ● Accessing elements CSS syntax is used to access elements, so you do not need to   learn or use all of the necessary JavaScript coding necessary to do this consistently cross- browser.   ● Making changes to the document Changing the appearance of or content within   elements is more intuitive than it is in JavaScript. For example, jQuery uses the append   method to add content to the end of an element, which is easy to remember when you need  to perform the task.   ● Creating effects Numerous methods for creating animations to move, show, or hide   elements are available to easily implement these effects cross-browser.   ● AJAX jQuery provides methods for retrieving information from the server to ease the   burden of writing cross-browser code to do so in JavaScript.  In addition to this, jQuery has methods that allow you to easily work with arrays and other  items in JavaScript. For example, the jQuery.inArray   method can be used to easily search for    8  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  items in an array, which in JavaScript would require a special function to be written for older  browsers that may not support the indexOf   method for arrays. Who Can Use jQuery? jQuery is open source, so it is free to be used by anyone. It has a dual license under both the  GNU Public License, which allows it to be used on other open-source projects that are under  the GNU Public License, and the MIT License, which allows it to be used on any Web site.  This flexibility makes it an easy and cost-efficient tool to implement in order to assist with the  coding of dynamic effects.  Why jQuery Is Useful  Many Web designers and developers do not have the additional time required to learn all of the  details of JavaScript programming necessary to create dynamic changes or effects and have  them work cross-browser.  Designers tend to be more focused on graphics, layout, HTML, and CSS. Design is a large   job in itself, so it would certainly be handy to have a tool that made the addition of dynamic  effects easier than outright JavaScript programming. Developers often have to know one or  multiple server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and others, so it would be helpful  not to be required to learn yet another language in order to perform client-side scripting tasks.  jQuery does a number of things to help those working on Web sites: It is accessible, it addresses   browser inconsistencies, and it provides plugins for those who need additional functionality. Accessible jQuery addresses the needs of designers and developers alike by having syntax that is  accessible to both programmers and nonprogrammers. Since most designers and developers  are familiar with CSS code, using CSS selectors as the basis for accessing elements makes it  much easier to begin adding dynamic effects without needing to work with yet another set of  rules in JavaScript.  With jQuery, you can select elements via their element name, id, class name, or most   any valid CSS selection method. For example, using the string “div.news-item” will select all    elements with a class name of news-item. This is much simpler than iterating through  in JavaScript to find either all the elements with the class name of news-item and then finding  the   elements within that set, or finding all of the   elements and then determining  which ones have the news-item class name. Browser Inconsistencies While browsers have improved at the task of adhering to standards, there are still differences,  which can often lead to headaches for designers and developers—especially when a client or  employer wants a dynamic effect and needs it to work in all browsers. Often, an older version  of a browser needs to be supported, which may require additional JavaScript coding to make a  desired effect possible in that browser.   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  9  Instead of having the designer or developer bear this burden in a potentially unfamiliar   language, jQuery handles the integration of coded effects into each browser so that they work  consistently. As of this writing, jQuery supports most browsers in their current version and  their previous version  Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera . For Internet Explorer, jQuery 1.x  supports version 6 and above, while jQuery 2.x supports version 9 and above. Additional Functionality When the core jQuery library lacks some functionality you need for your project, you can  usually find that functionality available as a jQuery plugin. This flexibility allows you to  extend the library when needed, while simply using the slim core library  a minified file of  32KB at the time of this writing  when additional functionality is not required.  Begin Using jQuery  To begin using jQuery, you will need to insert the script into an HTML document. You can do  this by downloading the jQuery library and including the downloaded copy in your document, or  you can simply include the script from a Content Delivery Network  CDN  and begin using it. Obtaining jQuery If you want to use your own copy of jQuery, which is advantageous if you are going to need  to use it in an environment that isn’t always connected to the Internet, then you will need to  download it from the jQuery Web site. Download the Library First, go to the jQuery Web site at http:  jquery.com download . You will be given two  options: to download the compressed production version or to download the uncompressed  development version. At this point, you may choose either one.  If you are curious and would like to see the code within the library, you can download the  development version. However, before you place it live on a Web site, you will want to replace  it with the production version so that the library will load faster for your visitors. Inserting jQuery into a Document Once you have it downloaded, you will need to insert it into the HTML code of any documents  that will be using it. This is done in the same way that you insert any other JavaScript file into  a document, by adding a   element that points to the jQuery file.  The following   element shows how this can be done when the jQuery file is   located in the same directory as your HTML file:      If you keep your JavaScript files in a particular folder, you can adjust the src attribute as  needed to point to the proper place.  The jQuery site recommends placing the   element that calls the jQuery library   within the   element of a document. I would recommend placing it after your style    10  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  sheets are included and before your other JavaScript files are included  at least before the  JavaScript file you will use for writing your jQuery code . So, if you have a CSS file named  styles.css, and you have a JavaScript file named mycode.js that you will use for your jQuery  code, your HTML code would look similar to this test page:               My Site                     My Site    Welcome to my site! Obviously, this site is all about me! I probably  should think about others, but right now I am simply talking about me.      About Me  I enjoy writing HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I also picked up a love of  flying kites when a friend of my told me to &quot;Go fly a kite!&quot;  I did, and it has been a hobby ever since.        As you can see, the CSS file is added via the   element, and then the jQuery file and  the JavaScript file are included via the   element. The remainder of the page is simply  HTML and content that can be manipulated using jQuery.  With this in place, you are now set up to use jQuery! All you will need to do is add code   to your CSS file for styling and write jQuery code in your mycode.js file to begin. First,  however, you will need to make sure you want to include jQuery using this method rather than  using a CDN. Using a CDN An alternative to keeping your own copy of jQuery is to use a copy from a CDN, which is  an external network that allows content to be delivered all over the world. The most widely  used CDN for jQuery is Google, but there are numerous others, including Microsoft and  MediaTemple.  Loading the jQuery library from a CDN offers two advantages:   ● The file is loaded from the server that is closest to the user, improving the speed of the file   download.   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  11   ● If the user has downloaded the file from the same CDN previously, then it can be loaded   from the browser’s cache, eliminating the need to download it again.  The main disadvantage of this method is that an Internet connection is required  since the  file will be downloaded from an external source . If you need to work offline for development,  you will likely want to download your own copy as described in the previous section. Loading from a CDN To load the jQuery file from a CDN, you simply point the src attribute of the   element  to the external file. For example, to load the latest version  at the time of this writing  from the  Google CDN, you would use the following code:       To make sure you are loading the latest version, be sure to check the Google site at https:    developers.google.com speed libraries devguidejquery.  If you choose to use the Microsoft or MediaTemple CDNs, the proper URL can be   obtained from their sites, which are listed here:   ● Microsoft CDN www.asp.net ajaxlibrary cdn.ashxjQuery_Releases_on_the_CDN_0   ● MediaTemple http:  jquery.com download   Once you have the   element with the proper URL in place, you are ready to begin   using jQuery from the chosen CDN! Local or CDN: Which Method Should I Use? The method you choose will depend on your particular needs. If you are mainly developing  offline, then using a local copy will likely be the best solution. If you are distributing an  application live on the Web to numerous users, then a CDN may be a better choice, since it can  help speed up the loading of the application.  In this book, the examples will use a local copy of jQuery downloaded from the jQuery   site. Once you have downloaded the file, you will be able to use the provided code whether or  not you are currently connected to the Internet.  Your First jQuery Script  To begin, you will write a jQuery script that simply updates the style of a   element in an  HTML document. First, the code for the HTML document:               My Site    12  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide                     My Site    Welcome to my site! Obviously, this site is all about me! I probably  should think about others, but right now I am simply talking about me.      About Me  I enjoy writing HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I also picked up a love of  flying kites when a friend of my told me to &quot;Go fly a kite!&quot;  I did, and it has been a hobby ever since.        Save this file as index.html and make sure the jquery-1.9.1.min.js file is saved in the same  folder as the HTML file. You will also place your CSS and JavaScript files in this folder.  Next, save the following code in a file named styles.css:  .special { font-style:italic; }  This defines a single class named special, which you will add to one of the   elements  using jQuery.  Finally, save the following code in a file named mycode.js:  $ document .ready function   {     $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ; } ;  In this file, you will be writing the code that makes use of the jQuery library. This is technically  JavaScript code, but the jQuery library allows you to call special functions that make the syntax  simpler than typical JavaScript code.  Open index.html in your Web browser and examine the resulting page. You will notice that   most of the page displays with the default style settings of the browser, but the “About Me”  section is italicized. The jQuery code added the special class to that particular   element,  giving it additional styling. Figure 1-3 shows an example of the completed Web page when  viewed in a browser. Locating the Proper Element As a starting point, you will look at the middle line of code from the mycode.js file:  $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ;   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  13  Figure 1-3 The index.html file when viewed in a Web browser  The line begins by using the $   function to make a selection from the document. This allows  you to select one or more elements using CSS syntax, which is often more familiar than the  corresponding JavaScript syntax. In this case, the about-me class is selected by passing the  $   function a value of “.about-me”. Since only one element is using the about-me class, that  element is what is selected  the second   element .  Next, you will see a dot  . , which indicates that a method of the $   function will be called.  The method is appropriately named addClass, since it will add the styles in the specified class  to the selected element s . In this case, the styles in the special class are applied to the selected    element  the one with the about-me class .  Waiting for the Document to Be Ready The middle line of code by itself would likely have no effect when the page is loaded in a  browser. The browser would try to run this code before the document has finished loading  all of the necessary elements due to the code being placed within the   element.  To avoid this problem, jQuery provides a method named ready that can be applied to the  document.  In this script, the outer lines of code ensure that any code within them runs only after the   document is ready for changes to be made to its elements:  $ document .ready function   {        code } ;  As you can see, the ready method allows you to define a function that will be run once the  elements of the document have been loaded.   14  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  When using the ready method, you can provide what is called an anonymous function  like   the one you have been using  or a previously defined function name. For example, here is the  code you implemented, which uses an anonymous function:  $ document .ready function   {     $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ; } ;  To perform the same task by providing a defined function, you could instead use the following  code:  function makeSpecial   {   $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ; } $ document .ready makeSpecial ;  Here, a typical JavaScript function is defined, which uses the jQuery code to perform the same  task. The function is then called by using the function name in the ready method.  The main difference between the two approaches is that an anonymous function is most  often used when the function code is not reusable, while a defined function is used when the  function will be reused at a later time.  Try This 1-1  Add Another Class  index.html styles.css mycode.js  This project allows you to practice adding a class using jQuery. In this case, you  will add another line of code to add another class to an element on the index.html page you have been using.  Step by Step  1. Use your current index.html page for the HTML code.  2. In the styles.css file, update the file to add a new class named main-text that will set the font   size to 1.3em. Save the file. When complete, it should look like this code:    .special { font-style:italic; }   .main-text { font-size:1.3em; }  3. In the mycode.js file, add jQuery code that will add the main-text class to the div element   that has a class of main. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:     $ document .ready function   {        $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ;        $ ".main" .addClass "main-text" ;  } ;   Chapter 1: Getting Started with jQuery  15  4. Open the index.html file in your Web browser. You should see an increased font size for the   text underneath the level one heading.  Try This Summary  In this project, you added a class to another   element, which gave the text within it a  larger font size. This added another line to your CSS and your jQuery code. In the next chapter,  you will learn more about using the $   function to select elements and how you can use CSS  syntax to make element selection easier for you.

Chapter2  Selecting Elements  in the Document  19   20  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Key Skills & Concepts  ● The $   Function  ● CSS Basics  ● Using CSS Selectors              ● Using Extended jQuery Selectors  of selecting elements by covering the $   function, basic CSS, CSS selectors, and extended   Element selection is a fundamental part of using jQuery. This chapter will cover the basics  The $   Function  selectors. First, you will take a look at the $   function and how it works.  The $   function is used to select one or more elements in the document. It returns a collection  of elements that match the specified selection. $   is actually an alias for the full function  name, jQuery  .  TIP If you find that jQuery is in conflict with another JavaScript library that also uses the $    alias, you can use jQuery   in place of $   to fix the issue.  More technically, the $   function returns a jQuery object that points to all of the selected  elements. When you call a jQuery method such as addClass  , it is run for all of the selected  elements automatically, which keeps you from adding JavaScript loops to the code in order  to run the method for each element. This is a very useful feature that keeps extra coding to a  minimum and allows you to concentrate more on constructing the proper selectors and calling  the jQuery methods you want to use.  jQuery uses CSS selector syntax and also has a number of extended selectors that can be  passed to the $   function. To begin using CSS selectors, you will first want to understand the  basics of CSS and how it is used to select elements.  NOTE If you already know CSS, you may skip the “CSS Basics” section.  CSS Basics  While HTML is used to create the structure of a document, Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  is  used to shape the presentation of a document. For example, recall the plain HTML code from  the example page you have been using  index.html :   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  21  A CSS file named styles.css is included here.               My Site                     My Site    Welcome to my site! Obviously, this site is all about me! I probably  should think about others, but right now I am simply talking about me.      About Me  I enjoy writing HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I also picked up a love of  flying kites when a friend of my told me to &quot;Go fly a kite!&quot;  I did, and it has been a hobby ever since.        On its own, this would display as a plain page with very little design. The only presentation  is based on the browser default settings for displaying particular HTML elements. Figure 2-1  shows how this plain page would look in a Web browser. To give the page a more interesting  presentation and design, you can use CSS.   Figure 2-1 An HTML page with no CSS applied   22  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Notice that the HTML code already includes a style sheet via the href attribute of the     tag  styles.css . Updating the styles.css file will allow you to select elements in the HTML  document and define how they should look and where they should appear. Including the same  CSS file in each page of a site like this enables you to make numerous presentational changes for  the entire Web site by simply editing that single CSS file. This makes CSS  and, by extension,  jQuery  an especially helpful tool to use when designing and developing your Web sites. Selecting Elements In order to change the presentation of the document, you will need to select elements and  give them style declarations. This is a basic building block that will be used as the selection  syntax in jQuery, so once you know how to select elements in CSS, you can easily migrate that  knowledge over to your jQuery scripts.  CSS has numerous methods that can be used to select elements. Since many of these   techniques will be covered later in this chapter when discussing jQuery CSS selectors, you will  simply learn some basic CSS selectors at this time.  First, suppose you want to alter the look of the   element on the index.html page. An easy  way to select this would be to use the element name  h1 . You can then apply style definitions to  this by including them within a set of curly braces, as shown in the following code:  h1 { color:009; font-size:1.7em; }  In this case, the lone   element is selected and the style definitions within the curly braces  will be applied to that element. Had there been more than one   element on the page, this  would have selected and applied the styles to all of them.  As an example of this, you can select all of the   elements in the document by using   the element name as the selector:  div { font-family:Verdana; }  Add this code to your styles.css file, save it, and reload the index.html page in your Web  browser. Notice that since there are two   elements in the HTML code, they are both  affected by the style definition, which changes the font face to Verdana instead of the browser’s  default font face  typically a serif face such as Times New Roman .  Figure 2-2 shows the result of opening the page in a Web browser after these changes have   been made.  Selecting Elements Using IDs and Classes Another basic selection method is to use an id or class name to select elements. An id can only  be attached to one element in a document, while a class can be applied to numerous elements  to provide style information.  An id can be used if you know you need to select one particular element from the   document, while a class can be used if you need to style more than one element  but can also  be used on a single element if desired . In CSS, you select an id by preceding it with , while    Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  23  Figure 2-2 All text within all   elements uses the Verdana font.  a class name is preceded by a dot  . . For example, the following code shows both an id and a  class name being selected:  author-bio { font-size:0.8em; } .description { font-size:1em; }  An id is selected A class is selected  As an example of this, you can refer back to the index.html page you have been using.  It contains two classes: main and about-me. If you decide that any text with a class of main should use the Verdana font, you could simply use the following code in your CSS file:  .main { font-family:Verdana; }  Now that you know how to perform basic selections in CSS, you can now learn how to   select elements in jQuery and how to use more advanced CSS selectors.  Ask the Expert Q: The CSS lesson did not cover much. Is there more to learn? A: At this point, the most important thing you need to understand is how CSS is used to select  one or more elements. The “CSS Basics” section is simply an overview of this process and  does not replace a more thorough tutorial or book on CSS; however, it will help you get  started with jQuery if you are not able to delve into it in more detail right now.   continued    24  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Q: Aren’t there more complex CSS selectors, like the descendant selector, nth-child, and   A: Yes, and a number of these will be covered in more detail as you go through the “Using  CSS Selectors” section next. Since they are used for the jQuery syntax as well, you will  only need to cover them once to use them in your jQuery scripts.  Q: If I want to use more advanced selectors in CSS code rather than jQuery, can I learn   others?  how?  A: Yes! jQuery uses CSS syntax for selecting elements  outside of the extended selectors ,  so the same selection syntax would work in CSS by removing the $ “ ”  surrounding the  selector. For example, The use of a descendant selector in jQuery to select an element is  shown here:  $ "div p"   div p  In CSS, the same selector can be used by simply removing the jQuery code around the   selector, as shown in the following code:  You can then add any style declarations after the selector to complete the CSS for that   selection, as demonstrated in the following code:  div p { font-size:1.1em; }  If you decide you want to learn CSS itself in more detail, you can go to an online CSS  tutorial or grab a book on CSS.

This makes jQuery much easier to use than  JavaScript for those who already are familiar with CSS syntax.  The official jQuery site lists all of its supported selectors at http:  api.jquery.com category  selectors . Most of these are CSS selectors, but there are also a number of extended selectors  available in jQuery that are not part of the CSS specification.   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  25  To begin, Table 2-1 lists the CSS selectors that can be used with the jQuery library.   Extended selectors will be covered in the “Using Extended jQuery Selectors” section later in  this chapter.

We will go over a   number of the most used selectors in more detail here, but you can always make use of any of  the others if the situation calls for it.  The All, Element, Class, and ID Selectors The all, element, class, and id selectors provide some basic selections for you in jQuery  and  CSS . For example, look at this code:  Adds the special class to all elements in the document  Adds the special class to all    elements in the document  $ "*" .addClass "special" ; $ "div" .addClass "special" ; $ ".about-me" .addClass "special" ; $ "author-bio" .addClass "special" ;  Adds the special class to all elements  that have the about-me class  Adds the special class to the element  with an id of author-bio  The most inclusive selector is the all selector, which selects all of the elements   in the document, regardless of what they are or what class or id is used. This selector  is not used often, since it does not select anything more specific—you will almost  always want to select one element or a particular group of elements rather than every  one of them.  The element selector simply selects all elements of the specified tag name. This means that   $ “div”  will select all   elements, $ “a”  will select all   elements, and so on.  The class selector selects all elements that have the specified class name, regardless of   the tag name. This means that $ “.about-me”  would select any of the elements shown in the  following code:   content...   content...     Each element is different, but all of them have the about-me class. The   element has two  classes, one of which is about-me. This will still be part of the selection, since it does indeed  have the about-me class. As you get further into the selectors in this chapter, you will see  how you can be more specific about which elements to select, rather than relying solely on an  element or class name alone.  Finally, the id selector is used to select a single element in the document—the one with   the specified id. Rather than selecting multiple elements like the others mentioned here, it very  specifically selects a single element.  When you want to be sure only one element is selected for something, you can give   it an id in your HTML code and select it using the id selector. Thus, $ “author-bio”     28  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  will select only the element whose id is author-bio. The following code shows an example  for you: This element will be selected   I write for various Web sites.    My Site    More about me...   These elements will not be selected In this case, only the first   element will be selected. The second element is also a  ,  but does not have the correct id. The third element, even though it uses author-bio as a class  name, will not be selected because it, too, does not have the correct id.  NOTE Only one element can be assigned a given id. If more than one element uses the same  id, then only one of them  typically the first one  will be recognized. The Descendant Selector One way to be more specific about which elements to select is through the use of the  descendant selector. This can be used in conjunction with the element, class, and id selectors to  find elements that descend from a particular selection.  As an example, consider the following HTML code snippet:  These   elements descend  from both the   element  and the about-me class       I do many things, some of them are interesting.     If you want to know more, contact me.         If you like my site, please share it with others!     I will also recommend your site to others as well.     These   elements descend from both the   element and the share class  Any element within another element is a descendant of the outer element. In this case, all  of the   elements are descendants of   elements. For instance, the following code  shows three different collections of   elements that can be selected using the descendant  selector.  Selects all of the   elements that are within   elements  all four in this case   $ "div p"  $ ".about-me p"  $ ".share p"   Selects all   elements are within elements that have the  about-me class  the first two in this case   Selects all   elements that are within elements that have the share class  the last two in this case   One thing you will need to watch when using the descendant selector is that it selects   all descendants, regardless of nesting. This can lead to some unexpected results when dealing    Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  29  with nested lists, div elements, or other items. For example, consider the following HTML  code:  A nested list               My Site          ul {list-style-type:disc;}     .items { list-style-type:square; }                        Pencils     Paper     Books              Science Book         History Book                   Save this file as desc.html. Notice that this list includes one nested list and a class named items within    tags that can be added to the list items using jQuery. You can use the  descendant selector to add the class, as shown in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies li" .addClass "items" ; } ;  Save this file as desc.js and then open desc.html in your browser. Figure 2-3 shows what this  page will look like.  Notice that every list item uses a square marker, even the nested list items. This may be all   you require, but you may decide later that you only want the items in the outer list to display  the square marker. This can be done using the child selector, discussed next.  The Child Selector The child selector selects all specified elements that are children of the given parent element.  For example, review the code in your desc.html file. Suppose you want to select only the list    30  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 2-3 The descendant selector affects all of the list items.  items in the outer list and have them display a square marker. This can be done by changing  your jQuery code in desc.js to the following:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies" .addClass "items" ; } ;  Save the change to the desc.js file and then reload the desc.html file in your browser. Figure 2-4  shows the result of using the child selector on the list.  CAUTION Some style rules, such as font colors, font weights, text decorations, and others, will still  be inherited by the parent element’s grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on  even though the child selector is used. For more about this, see www.stackoverflow .com questions 14789094 does-child-combinator-css-affects-sibling-elements.  The First Child, Last Child, and Nth Child Selectors The first child, last child, and nth child selectors allow you to select particular elements based  on their location within the parent element.  Figure 2-4 Using the child selector allows only the top-level list to use the square markers.   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  31  The first-child Selector Going back to the desc.html file you have been using, notice that the   elements are  all children of   elements. The relevant portion of the HTML is displayed again in the  following code:       Pencils     Paper     Books              Science Book         History Book               Suppose that you wanted any   element that is the first child of a   element to have a  square marker. In this case, that would select both the “Pencils” and “Science Book” list items,  since they are first children of   elements.  To make the selection, you can use the following code:  $ "ul li:first-child"   Notice the colon between li and first-child. Basically, this selection tells jQuery to look for all    elements that descend from   elements, but only if the   element is a first child of  the   element. With this in place, you can alter the code in your desc.js file as follows:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "ul li:first-child" .addClass "items" ; } ;  Save these changes and reload the desc.html page in your browser. Figure 2-5 shows the   result.  Figure 2-5 Only the first children of each unordered list are changed to have a square marker.   32  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The last-child Selector You can use the same process for last-child to select the last items in each list, which will be  “Books” and “History Book” in this case. Simply change the selection to use last-child instead,  as in the following code:  $ "ul li:last-child" .addClass "items" ;  The nth-child Selector When using nth-child, you will need to supply an index number for the element you are  seeking. This is done in parentheses at the end, as in the following code  which selects all    elements that are the second child of   elements :  $ "ul li:nth-child 2 "   In this case, you would be selecting the “Paper” and “History Book” list items. To see this in  action, you can alter your desc.js file to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "ul li:nth-child 2 " .addClass "items" ; } ;  Figure 2-6 shows the result of reloading the page in your browser. Notice that the second item  in each list uses the square list marker. The Not Selector The not selector allows you to select elements that do not match a selection. For example,  consider the following HTML code:   I am cool.   I don't feel very cool.   Not cool.   Nice and cool here!   Very cool indeed!   Figure 2-6 The use of nth-child allows the second item in each list to have a square marker.   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  33  Notice that several of the   elements have a class of cool. There are two other   elements  that are not part of that class: One has no class and the other has a class of uncool.  While you can easily select any element with a class of cool, it may not be so easy to find   the remaining elements and select them. The use of not allows you to select those elements  easily. For example, to select all of the   elements that do not have a class of cool, you can  use the following selection:  $ "p:not .cool "   Notice that you provide a selection within the parentheses. In this case, it eliminates any    elements that do not have the cool class. Attribute Selectors Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based on the value of a particular attribute  or  whether an element actually has the specified attribute . This gives you another helpful tool to  select the elements you need. The Has Attribute Selector First, you can select elements that have a particular attribute. For example, you may want to  select all   elements that have a class attribute. You could do this using the following code:  $ "p[class]"   Consider the following HTML code:   I have class!   I have no class.   I have plenty of class!   Here, $ “p[class]”  would select the first and the last paragraph, but would leave out the  second, since there is no class attribute.  You can combine this with other selectors as well. By combining it with the not selector,   you could build a quick jQuery script to highlight images that are missing an alt attribute. First,  you will need an HTML page, so use the following code and save the page as noalt.html:               My Site            .needs-alt { border:5px solid F00; }                    A class named needs-alt is defined, which will  be added to any image missing an alt attribute   34  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide                       This   element has no alt attribute and needs to be highlighted  Next you will need to write your jQuery code. Use the following code and save the file as   noalt.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "img:not [alt] " .addClass "needs-alt" ; } ;  Here, not is applied to the   elements to determine which ones are missing alt attributes.  Any of them that are found will have the needs-alt class applied to them, which will place a  5-pixel colored border around any images missing an alt attribute. In this case, the third image  should be highlighted once the noalt.html page is opened in your browser. Figure 2-7 shows  how this looks when run.  Figure 2-7 The highlighted image needs an alt attribute!   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  35  The Attribute Equals Selector The attribute equals selector will select all elements that have the attribute and its value is  equal to a specified value. For example, to select all   elements that have an alt attribute  with a value of cool, you could use the following code for the $   function:  $ "img[alt='cool']"   Notice that you need to use quote marks around the value of the attribute. Since you already  have double quotes around the selection, you cannot place another set of double quotes inside  of it. You either need to use single quotes  as in the code example  or escape the inner set of  double quotes using a backslash  \ .  When dealing with quotes, jQuery uses the same rules as JavaScript. If you have one set of  quote marks within another set of quote marks, you need to alternate quote mark types  single  quotes within double quotes, double quotes within single quotes  or escape the same quote  mark type using the backslash character  which will be the only alternative if you have to go  more than one level deep . In the case of this example, you can alternate the quote mark types  as mentioned previously, or use the backslash to escape another set of double quotes, as shown  in this code:  $ "img[alt=\"cool\"]"   Notice the backslashes, which escape  the inner set of quote marks  The attribute equals selector could be used with the code from the previous section  your   noalt.html and noalt.js files , which had four images that needed alt attributes. Recall the  original HTML code for the images, shown in the following code listing:                   Since the last script located the image with no alt attribute  the third one , you can now fix it,  as in the following code:                   Suppose you now want to run a test to be sure that no images have a particular value for their  alt attributes. You could change the code in your noalt.js file to the following:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "img[alt='cool']" .addClass "needs-alt" ; } ;   36  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 2-8 The second and third images have cool as the alternative text.  Save the changes and then reload the noalt.html file in your browser. Notice that it will now  highlight the second and third images, which both have alt values of cool. You now know  that you will need to change these values if you want to use more meaningful text. Figure 2-8  shows the results when run in a browser.  A script like this could save you quite a bit of time if you were to search a page with  numerous images and wanted to eliminate generic alternative text such as “photo,” “pic,”  “image,” and so on. The Remaining CSS Selectors The other selectors mentioned in the table are also available, but will not be covered in detail  here. As they come up for use in the book, however, they will be explained at that time.  This section gave an overview of the most used selectors for those who need to dive in   quickly, but it is a good idea to study CSS in more detail as you have time in order to become  more familiar with the other selectors and what they do.   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  37  Try This 2-1  Add Another Class  pr02-01.html pr02-01.js  This project allows you to practice using jQuery CSS selectors to select items  and add a class to the selected items.  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr02-01.html:               Project 2-1          .intro { font-style:italic; color:AA0000; }       .main { font-family:Arial; }       .end { font-family:monospace; }                    I am the first paragraph! Howdy!   I am the second paragraph. I just sit here  under the first one.   I am the third and last paragraph on this page!        2. In the pr02-01.js file, add jQuery code that will add the intro class to the first   element   within the   element.  3. Add the main class to any element in the document that has the main-text class.  4. Add the end class to any element that has the end-text class.  5. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "body p:first-child" .addClass "intro" ;   $ ".main-text" .addClass "main" ;   $ ".end-text" .addClass "end" ; } ;   continued    38  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  6. Open the pr02-01.html file in your Web browser. You should see the first paragraph   displaying in italic, Arial font. The second should display in an Arial font without italics.  The last paragraph should display in a monospace font.  Try This Summary  In this project, you added classes to selected elements using the jQuery $   function and CSS  selectors to select those elements. You were able to practice your selection techniques using the  first-child and class selectors.  Using Extended jQuery Selectors  In addition to standard CSS selectors, jQuery offers its own extensions in order to provide  additional methods for you to easily select elements. Table 2-2 lists the jQuery extended  selectors.  Name Animated  Syntax :animated  Attribute Not Equal  [attribute-name!= ‘value’]  Button  :button  Check Box Contains  :checkbox :contains    Element at Index  :eq    Even  File First  Elements at Index  Greater Than  :even  :file :first  :gt    Table 2-2 Extended jQuery Selectors  Description Selects all of the elements in the document  that are currently animated Selects all elements that have the attribute- name attribute where the value of the  attribute is not equal to the specified value Selects all of the button elements  both  button elements and input elements of the  button type  Selects all check boxes Selects all elements that contain the text  specified Selects the element at the specified index   zero-based  from a collection of elements Selects all even elements from a collection  of elements  zero-based index  Selects all file elements Selects the first element from a collection of  elements Selects all elements at an index greater  than the specified index  zero-based    Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  39  Elements at Index  Less Than Odd  Name Has  Header  Hidden Image Input  Last  Parent  Password Radio Reset Selected  Submit Text Visible  Syntax :has    :header  :hidden :image :input  :last  :lt    :odd  :parent  :password :radio :reset :selected  :submit :text :visible  Description Selects all elements that contain one or  more matches for the specified selector Selects all heading elements  h1, h2, h3,  and so on  Selects all hidden elements Selects all image elements Selects all input elements  includes input,  textarea, select, and button  Selects the last element from a collection of  elements Selects all elements at an index less than  the specified index  zero-based  Selects all odd elements from a collection  of elements  zero-based index  Selects all elements that contain one or  more child nodes Selects all password elements Selects all radio elements Selects all reset elements Selects all elements that are selected  from  a select list  Selects all submit elements Selects all text elements Selects all visible elements  Table 2-2 Extended jQuery Selectors  continued   You will now look at some of these in more detail to see how they can assist you in making   selections in jQuery. The Attribute Not Equal Selector The attribute not equal selector provides you with a way to perform the opposite action of the  CSS attribute equals selector: It will select all elements that have the attribute but where the  value is not equal to the specified value.   40  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  In the example noalt.html and noalt.js files you have been using, you could use this   selector to select any elements where the value of the alt attribute is not equal to cool. Recall  the images in the HTML, which are shown in the following code:                   Change your noalt.js file to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "img[alt!='cool']" .addClass "needs-alt" ; } ;  Save your changes and reload the HTML file in your browser. It should now highlight the   first and fourth images, which do not have cool as the alternative text. Figure 2-9 shows the  results of this script.  Figure 2-9 The first and fourth images do not have cool as the alternative text.   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  41  The First, Last, and Element at Index Selectors The first, last, and element at index selectors allow you to select a single element from a  collection. This can be useful, for instance, when you simply want the first   element within a    element rather than including all of the first children of all of its inner   elements as well.  You will be using your desc.html and desc.js files from earlier in this chapter to look at   how these selectors work. For reference, here is the relevant HTML code from the page:       Pencils     Paper     Books              Science Book         History Book               Recall also that the CSS code included a class named items, which would make any selected  list item use a square marker. You will alter the desc.js file as necessary in the examples in  order to use the selectors. The first Selector The first selector will select the first element that matches a selection, based on the order the  elements appear in the HTML code. For example, if you want to select the first list item from  the supplies list in your desc.html file, alter your desc.js file to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies li:first" .addClass "items" ;  } ;  Rather than selecting all the first children the way the first-child selector does, first simply  selects the first one—and that’s it. Figure 2-10 shows the result of this script when run in a   Figure 2-10 Only the first element is affected when using the first selector.   42  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  browser. Notice that only the first list item  “Pencils” in this case  displays with the square list  item marker.  The last Selector The last selector will select the last element that matches a selection. For example, you can  alter your desc.js file to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies li:last" .addClass "items" ;  } ;  Save the updates and then reload desc.html in your Web browser. The last list item  “History  Book”  will use the square marker. Notice that this element is within a child  , but is still  the last   element within the selected list and thus is the element that is selected when  using last.  The Element at Index Selector The element at index selector selects the element at a specified index within the  matched elements. For example, suppose you want to select the second element from the  supplies list  “Paper” . You can do this by changing your desc.js files to use the following  code:  The second element is selected  with the index 1 rather than 2!  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies li:eq 1 " .addClass "items" ;  } ;  Notice that the syntax is eq n , where n is the index of the element you want to select.  However, this selector uses a zero-based index, meaning that it starts counting from zero rather  than one. As a result, you will need to remember to specify the index number as one less than  expected  if you are familiar with JavaScript arrays, this works the same way since they also  use a zero-based index . Here, the second matched element is selected by specifying 1 as the  index.  So, to select the first element, you would use zero as the index, as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".supplies li:eq 0 " .addClass "items" ;  } ;  This selects the first matching    element   Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  43  The Even and Odd Selectors The even and odd selectors allow you to select either the even-numbered items or odd- numbered items within a collection of matched elements. Often, this is used for structures such  as tables, where you may want to change the background color on every other row to make it  easier to read. For example, consider the following code:  This class will be added to every  other row in the table               My Site          .emp-alt { background-color:DDD; }                          Name     ID         John     12345         James     12346         Heather     12347         Jerry     12348           This creates a simple table to display employee names and id numbers. To make it easier to  read, you could use the even selector to add the emp-alt class to each even row of the table.  Note, however, that this uses a zero-based index, so the first row of the table will be row zero,  and thus even.   44  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 2-11 The table uses alternating row colors to make it easier to read.  The following code will add the class to the even rows:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".employees tr:even" .addClass "emp-alt" ; } ;  This will make the first  index 0 , third  index 2 , and fifth  index 4  rows display with a light  gray background, while the others continue to use the default background color. Figure 2-11  shows how this will look when viewed in a browser.  Try This 2-2  More Selection Practice  pr02-02.html pr02-02.js  This project allows you to practice selecting elements using the extended jQuery  selectors in combination with CSS selectors so that you can create a data table  with a unique heading row and alternate the color of each data row.  Step by Step  1. Insert the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr02-02.html:             Project 2-1          .emp-head { background-color:005; color:FFF; }     .emp-alt { background-color:DDD; }                 Chapter 2: Selecting Elements in the Document  45             Name     ID         John     12345         James     12346         Heather     12347         Jerry     12348           2. In the pr02-02.js file, add jQuery code that will add the emp-head class to the first table row   element.  3. For every other row after the first, add the emp-alt class using the even selector. Hint: You   can use the not selector to keep the first row from being affected.  4. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".employees tr:first" .addClass "emp-head" ;   $ ".employees tr:even:not tr:first " .addClass "emp-alt" ; } ;  5. Open the pr02-02.html file in your Web browser. You should see the table display with  a dark blue background and white text on the header row, and every other row after that  should display with a light gray background.   continued    46  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This Summary  ✓  Chapter 2 Self Test  In this project, you used your knowledge of CSS and extended selectors to style a data table to  be easier to read and have a unique header row.

Typically, an   event occurs when a user performs some type of action such as a mouse click, key press, or  form submission. Some events can also be triggered by calling them programmatically, which  can be helpful when you need to perform a task automatically.  The jQuery library offers a number of features that make handling events an easier   task than when using JavaScript, especially when it comes to handling browser differences.  Rather than worrying about using addEventListener  , attachEvent  , and DOM Level 0 event  handlers based on the capabilities of different browsers, you can use something as simple as  click   or keydown   to handle an event, and jQuery will do the rest of the work for you.  Waiting for the Document to Be Ready  As you will remember from previous chapters, jQuery offers you the ready   function so that  you can be sure that all the elements in the document are loaded before running jQuery code  on them. This is certainly important when you are reacting to a user event, since you do not  want the user to receive JavaScript errors when interacting with your Web site or application. ready   vs. load   In JavaScript, you will see a number of scripts use the load event on the window object to  determine when all the elements have been completely loaded. For example, you may see  something similar to the following code:  window.onload = function   {      Code to execute when elements have loaded }  Alternatively, you might see a more modernized version, using the addEventListener   function, as in the following code:  window.addEventListener "load", function   {      Code to execute when elements have loaded }, false ;   Chapter 3: Event Handling  51  Notice the similarity to using ready   in jQuery, shown in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {      Code to execute when elements have loaded } ;  What Is the Difference? There is an important difference between the two methods. The ready   method allows you to  begin running your script as soon as all of the elements have been loaded, but it does not wait  for images or other media to finish loading. The JavaScript load event waits for the document  and all media to be loaded before it is triggered.  Many scripts can be run without worrying about whether images or other media have   loaded, which allows ready   to give you access to the elements in the document more quickly  than the load event. This gives the users a better experience when media isn’t essential to the  script, allowing them to more quickly interact with your Web site or application.  On the other hand, when running a script that works with images  such as a slideshow ,   using ready   could cause unexpected results. If the script needs to show an image that has not  yet loaded, it could show a broken image or nothing at all. In cases like this, it is better to wait  for the load event to ensure that all of the media has been loaded before being manipulated.  When you need to wait for the load event, jQuery provides you its own load method,   which does the cross-browser work for you. The following code uses the jQuery load function:  $ window .load function    {      Code to execute when elements and media have loaded } ;  Throughout the remainder of the book, you will see ready   used for most scripts, while   the load method will be used when necessary to wait for other media to load.  Using the $ Argument with ready   The ready   method also performs one more helpful task for you. Suppose you are using  jQuery as well as another JavaScript library  such as prototype  that uses the $ identifier  to shorten the code. Rather than replacing all instances of $ with jQuery, you can call  jQuery document .ready   and include all of your jQuery code within the ready   method and  send $ as an argument, as in the following code:  jQuery document .ready function $  {      Code to execute. $ can be used as expected in here. } ;  This allows the other library to use the $ identifier and allows you to use it with your jQuery  code. One problem can still exist, though.   52  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  When using more than one library that uses the $ identifier, the last one included in the   HTML code will take control of it, making $ buggy or unusable for the other libraries. In  addition to sending the $ argument to ready, jQuery provides the noConflict   method to ensure  that it does not take control of the $ identifier.  Suppose you had the following code in the head section of your HTML document:  The prototype library is included, and controls the $ identifier            Your own JavaScript file, which now cannot use $ with both libraries  The jQuery library is included, and takes control of the $ identifier from prototype!  Notice that prototype will initially control the $ identifier, but this is quickly taken away on the  next line by the inclusion of jQuery. To fix this, you can use jQuery’s noConflict   method, as  in the following code:           jQuery.noConflict  ;       Calling the noConflict   method immediately after jQuery is loaded  will give control of the $ identifier back to the prototype library  This will now allow $ to be used by prototype. As an added bonus, you can still use $ with  your jQuery code by sending the ready   method the $ argument, as described previously!  NOTE You can call the noConflict   method in your own JavaScript file  yourcode.js in this  case  if you prefer; just be sure to place it on the first line of your code.  Now that you know when to begin reacting to events, it’s time to learn how to handle those   events.  Handling an Event  The jQuery library provides several methods for handling events. For the most common events,  jQuery has its own shorthand functions to make it easy to react to a user event. Other events  can be added using the on   method, which will be discussed later in this chapter. First, you  will look at basic event handling using one of the jQuery shorthand functions.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  53  Basic Event Handling Suppose you need to perform an action when the user clicks an element. jQuery provides the  click   method to handle this event. For example, if you had an element with an id of change- size, you could use the following code:  $ "change-size" .click function   {      Code to execute when element is clicked } ;  The click   method calls a function that will be run when the event occurs. The code within the  function will then execute and react to the click event.  Since this script will not require media to be loaded, you can place everything inside of the  ready   function, as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "change-size" .click function   {        Code to execute when element is clicked   } ; } ;  The ready   function surrounds  all of the code to  be executed  The click event is handled with the inner function  Using the click Event Now that you have seen the basic syntax, you can apply it to a Web page to react to a click event. Place the following HTML code into a file and save it as size.html:               Project 2-1          .large-font { font-size:1.5em; }                     This text is important! Click this text to enlarge it if needed!        This   element will have a class  added to it when it is clicked   54  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Next, place the following code into a file and save it as size.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "change-size" .click function   {       $ "change-size" .addClass "large-font" ;   } ; } ;  The click   method calls a  function to handle click events  on the change-size element  A class is added to the change-size element when it is  clicked, which in this case will enlarge the font size  Open the size.html file in your browser and click the text. It will become larger when clicked,  since a class is added to make the font size larger in the function that handles the event. Figure  3-1 shows how the initial page looks in the browser, and Figure 3-2 shows how the page looks  after the text is clicked.  While this script works, it isn’t very obvious that the font size can be enlarged. The user   would need to know to click the text itself to enlarge it. To improve usability, it would be  helpful to have the user click a different element that tells the user what it does, such as a  button. Update the Click Script To update the script, you will need to alter both the HTML code and the jQuery code. First,  change the HTML within the    tags of the size.html page to the following code  and save the file:    This text is important! Click this text to enlarge it if needed!              Enlarge Text         A form button is added  so that the user can click  it to enlarge the font  Figure 3-1 The initial page   Chapter 3: Event Handling  55  Figure 3-2 The page after the text has been clicked, displaying a larger font size  A form with a button labeled “Enlarge Text” is added, giving the user a clear action to take to  enlarge the text.  Notice that it is within a form and that the action attribute of the form is pointed to an   alternate HTML page that would have enlarged text. This is a fallback for accessibility in case  the user does not have JavaScript enabled: The user will still be able to view the enlarged text  since the browser will go to that alternate page.  NOTE There are a number of ways to make the script accessible; this just demonstrates one  option. Other possibilities include the use of a server-side script as the action of the  form, hiding the button for those without JavaScript  if the functionality is considered an  enhancement rather than a necessity , and other options.  To make the button change the font size, you will need to alter the jQuery script. Change   the size.js file to use the following code and save it:  The element that handles the click is changed from the  change-size   element to the enlarge   element  $ document .ready function   {   $ "enlarge" .click function   {     $ "change-size" .addClass "large-font" ;   } ; } ;  The change-size   element is still the one  that will have the large-font class added to it  Notice that the only change is that the click   function is now attached to the    element  with the id of enlarge  rather than the   element, which contains the text to  enlarge.  Open the size.html file in your browser and click the button. The text changes size, but the  browser goes to the alternate page  maybe even more quickly than the change occurs ! This is  not quite the desired result, and will require a couple of alterations in order to fix it.   56  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Fixing the Updated Click Script The action attribute specified that the button should go to a second HTML page  size-larger.html  when clicked. While this is a good feature for those without JavaScript, it certainly is not what  you want it to do for those who have JavaScript enabled.  To fix this, you will need to send the Event object to the click function as an argument.  The Event object contains information about the event that occurred, and has a method of  its own called preventDefault   that can prevent the default action from occurring when the  specified event occurs. The Event object will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, but you  can make use of some basics to fix this script.  First, you need to send the Event object as an argument to the function that will   handle the click event. In JavaScript, you simply place arguments within the parentheses     that follow the function keyword, and the same is true for jQuery. The following code  shows how the function called in the click method can be altered to pass along the  Event object:  $ "enlarge" .click function event  {  Notice that event is simply placed within the parentheses. Since it is already a defined object, it  does not need quote marks around it as a string argument would.  The next thing you will need to do is use the preventDefault   method of the Event object   within the function handling the click event. This is shown in this code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "enlarge" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "change-size" .addClass "large-font" ;   } ; } ;  This statement prevents the  default action from occurring   which would take the user to the  alternate HTML page  and allows  the user to remain on the current  page  Save the updates and then reload the size.html file in your browser. With the  event.preventDefault  ; statement in place, you will now be able to enlarge the text  without leaving the current page.  Figure 3-3 shows the initial page, and Figure 3-4 shows the page after the button is clicked.   The text is enlarged and the browser does not redirect you anywhere else.  Now that you know how to handle an event, you can begin learning the other jQuery   events.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  57  Figure 3-3 The initial page, before the button is clicked  Figure 3-4 The page after the button is clicked  Ask the Expert Q: Do all events have a shorthand method? A: Most of them do, but there are a few events that do not. They can be utilized by using the  on   method, which will be covered later in this chapter. The events that have shorthand  methods will be covered in the next section.  Q: Do I need to learn how to do all of this in JavaScript first? A: No, jQuery handles all of the JavaScript code behind the scenes for you. In the case of  handling events, the JavaScript code can get quite long when you want to support the  number of browsers that jQuery does. If you are selecting elements using something  besides an id, that can add work in JavaScript, as you will need to loop through elements,  check for matches, and return the matching elements—all of which the jQuery selectors do  for you automatically.   continued    58  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Q: Do I need to prevent the default action for every event? A: No, this is only necessary when the default action of an element will do something you do  not want it to, such as   or    that may submit a form and  redirect the user . Another example would be the   element with an href attribute, which  will send the user to another page or a different location on the same page. These give you  the opportunity to provide fallbacks for those without JavaScript enabled, but you will want  to prevent the default action for those who are able to run the script.  jQuery Events  The jQuery library offers support for JavaScript events both through shorthand methods and  through the use of the on   method. As you have seen, the shorthand methods are very handy  and make it easy to bind an event to an element.  You can now learn what each event is and when it will occur while a user is interacting   with your Web page or application. First, you will learn the events that have shorthand  methods available; then you will learn the remaining events and how to use on   to bind them  to elements.  To begin, Table 3-1 lists the events in jQuery that have shorthand syntax. These events are discussed in more detail in the following sections.  Mouse Events Mouse events allow you to react to actions the user can take with the mouse, such as clicking  or moving the mouse over a certain element on the page. Many scripts make use of one or  more of these events to interact with users. The click and dblclick Events You have already been using the click   method for click events, so it will be no surprise that  dblclick   does the same thing for double-click events.  A double-click occurs when the mouse button is pressed and released twice within a   certain period of time. The time allowed between the two clicks depends on the system, but  is typically a short amount of time such as a half-second. Users can override this on most  systems to a timing that is more comfortable for them  whether longer or shorter .  An example of the dblclick   method is shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .dblclick function   {      Code to execute when my-element is clicked } ;  The code within the handling function will run when the element is double-clicked.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  59  Click  Error  .click    .error    .dblclick    Double-click  Name Blur Change  Syntax .blur   .change    Description Occurs when an element loses focus Occurs when the value of an  ,  , or    element is changed  Occurs when the mouse pointer is over an element and the mouse  button is clicked and released Occurs when the mouse pointer is over an element and the mouse  button is clicked and released twice  Occurs when there is an error loading certain types of elements,  such as   Occurs when an element receives focus Focus Occurs when an element or any of its child elements receives focus Focus in Occurs when an element or any of its child elements loses focus Focus out Occurs when a key is pressed Key down Occurs when a key is pressed and released Key press Occurs when a key is released after being pressed Key up Load Occurs when an element and all of its child elements have loaded Mouse down .mousedown   Occurs when the mouse pointer is over an element and the mouse   .focus   .focusin   .focusout   .keydown   .keypress   .keyup   .load    button is pressed  Mouse enter Mouse leave Mouse move Mouse out Mouse over Mouse up  .mouseenter   Occurs when the mouse pointer enters an element .mouseleave   Occurs when the mouse pointer leaves an element .mousemove   Occurs when the mouse pointer moves inside of an element Occurs when the mouse pointer leaves an element .mouseout   .mouseover   Occurs when the mouse pointer enters an element .mouseup    Resize Scroll Select Submit Unload  .resize   .scroll   .select   .submit   .unload    Occurs when the mouse pointer is over an element and the mouse  button is released after being pressed Occurs when the browser window is resized Occurs when a user scrolls within an element Occurs when the user makes a selection within an element Occurs when the user requests that a form be submitted Occurs when the user leaves the current page  Table 3-1 Events with Shorthand Methods   60  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The mousedown and mouseup Events The mousedown and mouseup events each make up a portion of the click event. These  events are helpful if you need to capture a particular part of a mouse click. For example,  mousedown can be used to help determine that the user has begun dragging an item rather  than clicking it.  Here is a breakdown of a mouse click:  1. Mouse button is pressed. Triggers the mousedown event.  2. Mouse button is released. Triggers the mouseup event.  3. Mouse button has been both pressed and released. Triggers the click event.  This shows the order in which each event is triggered, which can help you when you need to  know what event to react to in various situations.  These shorthand methods are shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .mousedown function   {      Code to execute on mousedown } ; $ "my-element" .mouseup function   {      Code to execute on mouseup } ;  The mouseover and mouseout Events The mouseover and mouseout events occur when the user moves the mouse into an element  or moves the mouse out of an element. Due to the way these events are passed on to other  elements that can also handle them, it is usually preferable to use mouseenter and mouseleave, which are discussed next. The reasoning for this will be discussed in the “Event Capturing and  Bubbling” section later in this chapter.  Examples of these shorthand methods are shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .mouseover function   {      Code to execute on mouseover } ; $ "my-element" .mouseout function   {      Code to execute on mouseout } ;  The mouseenter and mouseleave Events The mouseenter and mouseleave events occur when the user moves the mouse into an element  or moves the mouse out of an element. The selected element will always be the one to handle  the event, so these methods are recommended over mouseover and mouseout.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  61  These shorthand methods are shown in the following example code:  $ "my-element" .mouseenter function   {      Code to execute on mouseenter } ; $ "my-element" .mouseleave function   {      Code to execute on mouseleave } ;  Another shorthand provided by jQuery is the hover   method, which can be used to   provide event handlers for the mouseenter and mouseleave events in one single method. An  example is shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .hover   function    {        Code to execute on mouseenter   },   function    {        Code to execute on mouseleave   }  ;  This function is executed when the  mouseenter event occurs  This function is executed when the  mouseleave event occurs  Notice the comma between the two functions, which separates them as arguments within the  hover   method. The mousemove Event The mousemove event occurs when the user has the mouse pointer over an element and moves  it. This event will continue to occur as long as the mouse pointer is moving while within the  element. Once the mouse pointer leaves the element, the event will stop until the mouse pointer  moves back onto the element.  An example of the shorthand method is shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .mousemove function   {      Code to execute on mousemove } ;  Keyboard Events Keyboard events are triggered when the user presses or releases a key on the keyboard. These  will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, but here is an overview of each of these events. The keydown and keyup Events The keydown and keyup events occur when the user presses or releases a key on the keyboard.  The shorthand methods are shown in the example code that follows.   62  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  $ "my-element" .keydown function   {      Code to execute on keydown } ; $ "my-element" .keyup function   {      Code to execute on keyup } ;  The keypress Event The keypress event occurs after the user has both pressed and released a key on the keyboard.  The shorthand method is shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .keypress function   {      Code to execute on keypress } ;  You will learn more about this event and how to capture specific keys in Chapter 7. Other Events The remaining events use the same shortcut syntax, and many of them will be covered as  example scripts are written throughout the book. A number of them can be used with form  elements, while others are related to the window or to other elements in the document.  For now, take a look at how event capturing and bubbling work.  Event Capturing and Bubbling When an event occurs, there are two phases: capturing and bubbling. These are used when  several elements could register the event, and is typically the result of nested elements, such as  in the following code  place this code in a file and save it as bubble.html :         Example    outer { border:1px solid 000; background-color:00FF33; padding:20px; } middle { border:1px solid 000; background-color:0000FF; padding:10px; } inner { border:1px solid 000; background-color:FFFFFF; padding:5px; }                            Show Message             Each of these elements  can handle an event  such as mouseout   Chapter 3: Event Handling  63            In a case like this, the  ,  , and   elements can all register a common event such as  mouseout. The last   element  text  is not affected if an event is added to any of the other  elements, since it is outside of that nesting.  In the capturing phase, an event will be sent to the least specific element that can handle  it and then passed on to each level until it reaches the most specific element that can handle it   in the case going from   to   to   . In the bubbling phase, an event will be sent to  the most specific element that can handle it and then passed on to each level until it reaches the  least specific element that can handle it  in this case going from   to   to   .  JavaScript allows you to specify one phase or the other to handle events, but browsers   especially older ones  may not follow this, instead using the default phase of that browser.  To help eliminate confusion, jQuery always uses the bubbling phase when registering events,  which makes event handling consistent across browsers. Scripting a mouseout The only other issue occurs when using methods such as mouseover   or mouseout  , which  do not stop the bubbling from continuing. This means that if you register a mouseout event to  the   element in the example code, the bubbling will cause the event to be registered with  the   element first, since it is the most specific element that could handle the event. It will  then register the same event handler to the   and then to the   element for which it was  originally intended.  To see what happens, place the following jQuery code into a file and save it as bubble.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "outer" .mouseout function   {       $ "text" .append "Mouseout! " ;   } ; } ;  Open the bubble.html file in your browser and move the mouse in and out of the three   elements  which are colored and surrounded by borders to help visualize what is happening .  You will notice that each time you move your mouse pointer out of any of the elements, a new  message is added to the last   element  text . This is probably not the functionality you were  looking for. Most likely, you would prefer this only to happen when the mouse pointer leaves  the originally intended element, which was the top   element  outer . Figure 3-5 shows the  initial page, while Figure 3-6 shows the page after several mouseout events have occurred.  NOTE The append   function in jQuery will add content to an element after any content  already in place. You will learn more about this method as you progress.   64  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 3-5 The page before any mouseout events  Figure 3-6 The page after several mouseout events have been fired  Obtaining the Desired Behavior with mouseleave Fortunately, jQuery provides the mouseleave   method, which does not continue bubbling, but  will instead handle the event only on the intended element. For example, update your bubble.js file to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "outer" .mouseleave function   {       $ "text" .append "Mouseout! " ;   } ; } ;  Reload the bubble.html page in your browser and try moving the mouse out of the three    elements again. This time, the message should only appear when you move the mouse pointer  out of the outer   element. Figure 3-7 shows the page after one mouseout event occurs on  the outer   element.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  65  Figure 3-7 Even if you move the mouse pointer over the inner   elements, only a single  mouseout event will occur on the outer   element.  Using the on   Method to Handle Events The on   method is relatively new to jQuery. This method was introduced in jQuery 1.7 to  supersede other methods of binding event handlers to elements: bind  , delegate  , and live  .  You will very commonly see these used in scripts, especially those written for versions   of jQuery before 1.7, so you will need to be familiar with them should you need to update or  debug a script that uses them. The bind   Method The bind   method is used to bind an event handler to an element that currently exists. This  means that any element using bind   must already exist—this method does not keep track of  the possibility of the element being added programmatically later, something delegate   can do.  An example of using the bind   method is shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .bind "click", function   {      Code to execute when my-element is clicked } ;  While the shorthand click   method takes only the handling function as an argument, the bind   method takes two arguments: the event name and the function to handle the event.  You can further customize it by having it use the same handler function for two different   events, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .bind "click keydown", function   {      Code to execute when my-element is clicked or a key is pressed  down } ;  This code would execute the function when the mouse button is clicked on the element or  when the user presses a key while within that element.   66  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  In jQuery 1.4 and later, you can use object notation to bind multiple events that use   different handling functions to an element. The following code shows an example of this:  Notice the curly bracket at the end  of this line, which begins an object  The event name is followed by a  colon, which is followed by the  handler function  $ "my-element" .bind {   click: function   {        Code to execute when my-element is clicked   },    keydown: function   {        Code to execute when a key is pressed within my-element   } } ;  This curly bracket ends the click  handler function, followed by a  comma indicating another event is to follow  This provides the function  for the keydown event  In JavaScript, structures such as functions and objects can be passed as arguments. This  structure passes an object using object literal notation, which allows you to define a list of  properties and values. Here, the properties are event names and the values are handler functions.  You will learn more about JavaScript structures that are used within jQuery in Chapter 5.  Finally, if you want to remove an event handler from an element, you can use the unbind    method. If you want to unbind all events from an element, you can simply call the unbind   method on the element, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .unbind  ;  If you want to remove one event type but keep others, you can specify the type of event to   remove by passing it as an argument, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .unbind "click" ;  This will remove all click event handlers from the element. If you need to remove specific click event handlers, you will need to namespace them. This will be discussed in later in this chapter  when you learn the on   method. The delegate   Method The delegate   method allows you to bind an event handler to any element, even if it won’t  exist until later due to being added through programming. It uses a selector to get any parent  elements, and then another selector is passed for the child elements that exist or will be added.  Most commonly, this would occur with a table, where you may need to add rows later based on  information supplied by the user.  The following code shows an example of the delegate   method:  $ "my-table" .delegate "td", "click", function   {     Code to run when a   element is clicked  } ;   Chapter 3: Event Handling  67  This will assign the handler function to react to all click events on all   elements within the  table, whether they exist already or get added to the document later.  You can remove handlers defined using delegate   by using undelegate  . This works much   like unbind  , as shown in the following code:  $ "my-table" .undelegate  ; $ "my-table" .undelegate "click" ;  Undelegates all event handlers Undelegates all click event handlers  This method is called delegate because it delegates the event handling from  the specified element to the selected element using event bubbling. Consider the  following code:  $ "my-table tr" .delegate "td", "click", function   {     Code to run when a   element is clicked  } ;  Here, the   that is passed as the first argument assigns the handling of the click event to the   element surrounding it. All   elements within the selection   the my-table   elements in this case  will delegate the click event to the    element surrounding it.  By delegating the event to its outer element, all of the   elements can use the handling   function for the click event, even if they are added to the document later. The live   Method The live   method works much like the delegate   method, but uses a slower method by  attaching events at the document element. The jQuery API documentation recommends using  on   or delegate   in its place.  If you need further information on live  , see http:  api.jquery.com live .  The on   Method The on   method combines the bind   and delegate   methods, allowing you to use a  single method whether you wish to use current and or future elements. The difference  is in whether an argument is present to tell jQuery to delegate the handler to a particular  element.  Using on   to Bind an Event Handler You can use on   in the same way as bind   by simply  calling it, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .on "click", function   {      Code to execute when my-element is clicked } ;   68  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  In the same fashion as bind  , you can use it to bind multiple events to elements, as in the  following code:  $ "my-element" .on {   click: function   {        Code to execute when my-element is clicked   },    keydown: function   {        Code to execute when a key is pressed within my-element   } } ;  Using on   to Delegate an Event Handler an argument to the on   method, as in the following code:    To use on   for event delegation, you simply add   $ "my-table tr" .on "click", "td", function   {    Code to run when a   element is clicked  } ;  Here, you pass an argument after the event name, which determines which elements will  delegate the event to the selected element s . In this case, any   element will delegate the  click event to the   element surrounding it. Using off   to Unbind or Undelegate an Event Handler undelegate  , you can use off   to remove an event handler from an element that added the  handler using on  .    As with unbind   and  To remove all event handlers from an element, you can use the following code:  $ "my-element" .off  ;  If you want to remove one event type, you can use the following code:  $ "my-element" .off "click" ;  Finally, if you want to remove a delegated event, you can use the following code:  $ "my-table tr" .off "click", "td" ;  This example will remove the click event delegated from the   elements to their  surrounding   elements within my-table.  Other Events In addition to the events with shorthand methods available, there are other events that can be  called using on   and the event name. These are listed in Table 3-2.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  69  Event contextmenu copy cut mousewheel paste reset  Table 3-2 Other Events  Description Occurs when the user activates the context menu Occurs when the user activates the copy command Occurs when the user activates the cut command Occurs when the user rolls the mouse wheel Occurs when the user activates the paste command Occurs when the user resets a form  These are JavaScript events for which jQuery has no defined shorthand function. These   events tend to be used less often than the others, but can be used in most modern browsers by  providing the event name in the on   method.  For example, to assign an event handler to the reset event, you could use the following   code:  $ "my-form" .on "reset", function   {      Code to execute when my-form is reset } ;  Since the reset event is tied to a   element, this example code would execute when the  form with an id of my-form is reset by the user.  Try This 3-1  Add Event Handlers  pr03-01.html pr03-01.js  This project allows you to practice using jQuery event methods by adding  an event handler using a shorthand method and another one using the on   method.  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr03-01.html:               Project 2-1        continued    70  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide      .bold-font { font-weight:bold; }                     This text is important! Click the button to make it bold if needed!              Make Text Bold                      Show Message             2. In the pr03-01.js file, add jQuery code that will add the bold-font class to the first     element when the first   element is clicked. Use the shorthand click   method. Make  sure to prevent the default action from occurring.  3. Add jQuery code that will append the text “Hi, hope you liked the important text!” to the  message   element when the show-msg   element is clicked. Use the on   method. Make sure to prevent the default action from occurring.  4. Save the file. When complete, it should look like this code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "make-bold" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-text" .addClass "bold-font" ;   } ;   $ "show-msg" .on "click", function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "message" .append "Hi, hope you liked the important text!" ;   } ; } ;  5. Open the pr03-01.html file in your Web browser. Click the first button and the important   text should become bold. Click the second button and the “Hi, hope you liked the important  text!” message should be inserted above the clicked button.   Chapter 3: Event Handling  71  Try This Summary  In this project, you practiced adding event handlers to elements by using jQuery shorthand  methods and the on  method. Also, you practiced passing the Event object to the handling  function and preventing the default event from occurring.  Triggering Events  Sometimes it is helpful to be able to simulate an event occurring without the user needing to  perform the action.  jQuery provides the trigger   method to allow you to trigger an event without the user   performing the actual event. An example of this method is shown in this code:  $ "my-element" .trigger "click" ;  This will cause the click event to fire on the my-element element. Any event handlers for  the click event that are attached to the element will be executed. For example, consider the  following code  save as trigger.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "show-msg" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ "message" .append "Hi, here is a message! " ;   } ;   $ "sim-show-msg" .mouseenter function   {     $ "show-msg" .trigger "click" ;   } ; } ;  A click event  handler is applied  to the show-msg element, which will  append a message  to the message element  The sim-show-msg element has a  mouseenter event attached to it  The click event is triggered without the  user clicking the show-msg element!  Here, a click event handler is assigned to the show-msg element, which will display a  message. A mouseenter event handler is applied to another element  sim-show-msg , which  uses the trigger   method to trigger the click event on the show-msg element.  Using the following HTML code with this jQuery code will allow you to see this in action.   Save the HTML file as trigger.html and the JavaScript file as trigger.js.               Example          sim-show-msg { border:1px solid 000; width:50%; }        72  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide                 Move the mouse pointer here to avoid  clicking!                Show Message             Open the trigger.html file in your Web browser. Move the mouse pointer over the bordered    element or click the button to show the message. Each time you perform either action,  the message will be appended to the message element again. Figure 3-8 shows the initial  page, and Figure 3-9 shows the page after one of the actions has been performed.  Figure 3-8 The initial page  Figure 3-9 The page after the mouse pointer moves over the bordered   element or the  button is clicked   Chapter 3: Event Handling  73  Try This 3-2  Trigger Practice  pr03-02.html pr03-02.js  This project allows you to practice firing an event without the user performing  that particular event. You will use the trigger   method to accomplish this.  Step by Step  1. Insert the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr03-02.html:               Project 2-1          .bold-text { font-weight:bold; }     sim-make-bold { border:1px solid 000; width:50%; }                     Move the mouse pointer here to avoid  clicking!   This is important! Really it is!             Show Message             2. In the pr03-02.js file, add jQuery code that will make the text in the imp-text element bold   when the user clicks the make-bold   element.  3. Add code to trigger the click event of the make-bold   element when the user’s   mouse pointer enters the sim-make-bold element.  4. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "make-bold" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;   continued    74  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide      $ "imp-text" .addClass "bold-text" ;   } ;   $ "sim-make-bold" .mouseenter function   {     $ "make-bold" .trigger "click" ;   } ; } ;  5. Open the pr03-02.html file in your Web browser. Either moving the mouse pointer over the  bordered   element or clicking the button will make the text bold. Refresh the page to  try the other action if desired.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of the trigger   method to trigger an event without  the user performing that particular event. This required an event handler for the actual event,  which was then triggered using the trigger   method.  ✓  Chapter 3 Self Test  1.

Chapter 4  Working with Styles  77   78  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Key Skills & Concepts           ●  CSS Rules  ●  The css   Method  ●  Class Methods     ●      Size and Position Methods  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  plays a major role in Web page design, and jQuery allows you   to work with its syntax in numerous ways to meet your scripting goals. You have already   seen how the $   function allows you to select elements using CSS selectors. In addition to  this, jQuery offers a number of methods that give you the ability to get the values of CSS  properties or to alter those properties.  In this chapter, you will learn how to use the css   method, class methods, and size   and position methods to retrieve or update CSS property values. To begin, you will look at  how CSS rules are defined, which will help you understand what the jQuery methods are  meant to do.  CSS Rules  As you have seen previously, CSS allows you to select elements by using element names,  classes, ids, and other types of selectors. When working with CSS code, you define the  selector and then define a rule within a set of curly brackets  {} . A rule consists of one or  more property and value pairs, with each pair separated by a semicolon. For example, the  following code shows how a typical style sheet definition looks in CSS code:  selector { property: value; property: value; }  As you can see, you will have a property name, a colon, and a property value. If more than   one property is defined, you add a semicolon after each set of property value pairs and repeat  the process.  These properties and values are what jQuery will allow you to retrieve or alter in your   scripts. Keep in mind, however, that you can make use of any CSS properties in jQuery, even if  they are not specifically defined in CSS code or in a style attribute. As a result, you can obtain  or alter any CSS property values as you need to in your script.  The css   Method  The jQuery library offers the css   method, which allows you to obtain values or make  alterations on the fly. As you will recall, the use of addClass   requires that the class to be  added already exists in the CSS code. This is not the case with the css  method; it allows you    Chapter 4: Working with Styles  79  to make changes to specific properties without the need to define what the values will be in  your CSS code beforehand.  The css   method, like the other jQuery CSS methods you will learn, allows you to call it  in two different ways. One way will get values and one will set values. In the case of the css   method, calling it with one string or array literal argument will get values, and calling it with  two string arguments or with an object literal argument will set values. Getting Values If you simply want to get one property value, you can call the css   method using the property  name as the argument, as shown in the following code:  var eColor = $ "my-element" .css "color" ;  In this example, the method will return the value of the color property for the element with  an id of my-element. In order to make use of the value, the returned result is assigned to a  JavaScript variable named eColor.  NOTE  When getting property values, you are not able to use shorthand properties. For  example, if you need to get the padding on all sides of an element, you will have to  use all four padding properties  padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and  padding-left  rather than the shorthand padding property.  To use the value, you could append it to an element to display it on the page, as in the   following code:  var eColor = $ "my-element" .css "color" ; $ "other-element" .append eColor ;  The value of the color property  for my-element is assigned to a  variable named eColor  The value is written on the page by adding the text to other-element. Notice that  since eColor is a variable name, it does not need to be within quote marks  This code both assigns a value to a JavaScript variable and uses the variable value. When using  the value of a variable, you do not need to enclose it in quote marks.  CAUTION Different browsers can return different strings for the value of a property. For  example, the color value for black could be returned as 000000, rgb 0,0,0 , or  another string. A plugin such as jQuery Color can help you get a consistent value  if you need to compare colors. You will learn about installing and using plugins in  Chapter 10.  Should you need to obtain multiple values, you can use an array literal as the argument, as   in the following code:  var eColor = $ "my-element" .css ["color", "background-color"] ;   80  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  This will return an array instead of a string. In this case, eColor will be assigned an array,  allowing you to access the color value using eColor[0] and the background-color value using  eColor[1].  NOTE If the selection in the $   function matches more than one element, only the property  value for the first matched element will be returned.  If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript variables, arrays, and other items, do not fear!   They will be explained in more detail in Chapter 5. In the meantime, they will be used in a  straightforward fashion as seen in the previous examples.  Setting Values The css   function also allows you to set the values of properties for any selected elements.  This can be useful when you don’t have access to the CSS code or simply need to quickly  change one or more property values on the fly. Setting a Single Property Value If you want to set a single property value, you send the css   method two arguments: the  property name and the value to be set. For example, to set the color property to FF0000, you  would use the following code:  $ "my-element" .css "color", "FF0000" ;  When setting a color, you can use any valid CSS value. In the case of the color red, values   such as FF0000, F00, red, rgb 100%, 0%, 0% , and rgb 255,0,0  are all valid ways of  setting a value to red.  Also, hyphenated property names can be written in CSS or JavaScript syntax. For example,   the background-color property in CSS is represented as backgroundColor in JavaScript   the hyphen is removed and the next letter is capitalized . This same pattern holds for all  hyphenated properties: margin-left to marginLeft, border-right-width to borderRightWidth, and so on.  If you use the JavaScript syntax, quote marks are optional around the property name. As a  result, each line of jQuery in the following code would set the background color of the element  to red:  $ "my-element" .css "background-color", "FF0000" ; $ "my-element" .css "backgroundColor", "FF0000" ; $ "my-element" .css backgroundColor, "FF0000" ;  CSS syntax  JavaScript syntax with  quotes  JavaScript syntax without  quotes  To be consistent, it is best to choose one convention and use it throughout your code. This  will make it easier to edit or debug later if needed. In this book, I will use the CSS syntax for    Chapter 4: Working with Styles  81  property names, but feel free to use one of the others should you feel more comfortable, or if  required  a coding convention where you are employed, for example .  NOTE If the selection in the $   function matches more than one element, the specified property  will be set for all matched elements in the selection.  Setting Multiple Property Values If you want to set multiple property values at once, you can send a single argument to the css   method in the form of an object literal. An object literal encloses property names and values  within curly brackets  {} .  The general format for object literal notation looks like the following code:  { property: value, property: value }  Notice that each property value pair is separated by a comma. Each property and its  corresponding value are separated by a colon. The entire set of property value pairs is enclosed  within curly brackets.  To use this with the css   method, you simply send an object literal as the argument.   Suppose you want to change the color property to white and the background-color property to  black. You could use the following code:  $ "my-element" .css {"color": "FFFFFF", "background-color":  "000000"} ;  For readability  especially when the list becomes long , you may wish to place each property  value pair on its own line, as in the following code:  The opening curly bracket  is on this line  The first property value pair  $ "my-element" .css {   "color": "FFFFFF",    "background-color": "000000" } ;  The ending curly bracket and the  end of the css   method call  The second property value pair  In this format, you can quickly scan each property value entry reading downward, which can  be helpful when you need to find something within an extensive list!  Using Relative Values jQuery 1.6 and higher allows you to use values beginning with += or −= to set relative values   setting the value incrementally higher or lower than its current value  for properties that are  based on numeric values, such as width, height, font-size, and so on.   82  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The value that is passed with += or −= will be interpreted by jQuery in pixels. Since you  may not always know the current pixel value of width, height, and other such properties  the  element may have its width defined with a percentage or other type of value , this allows you  to increment the pixel value rather than guess whether passing a certain pixel value will make a  property value larger or smaller.  For example, suppose you have the following HTML code  save it as expand.html :               Expand          expandable { width:20%; border:solid 1px 000; }                          This div can expand! Click the button below to add more width!                   Make Wider                 As you learned in the last chapter, you can assign a click event to the button element and then  perform your work. The following code shows how you can use css   to widen the expandable   element by 50 pixels each time the button is clicked  save it as expand.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "expand" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ "expandable" .css "width", "+=50em" ;   } ; } ;  Open the expand.html file in your browser and click the button. Each time you click, the width  of the   element will increase, giving the text more room to expand on the same line. You can do this with multiple property values as well. As you will recall, you can set   multiple property values using object literal notation. So, if you want to set the left padding to  expand along with the width, you could edit your JavaScript file to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "expand" .click function event  {    Chapter 4: Working with Styles  83  Two different properties are  incremented using object literal  notation      event.preventDefault  ;     $ "expandable" .css {          "width": "+=50",          "padding-left": "+=10"       } ;   } ; } ;  Save the expand.js file and reload expand.html in your browser. When you click the button,  the   element will expand and there will be additional padding to the left of the content.  Figure 4-1 shows the initial page, and Figure 4-2 shows the page after the button is clicked  once.  NOTE When setting incremental values, you are not able to use shorthand properties. For  example, if you need to set the padding on all sides of an element, you will have to  use all four padding properties  padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and  padding-left  rather than the shorthand padding property.  Figure 4-1 The initial page  Figure 4-2 The page after clicking the button once   84  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Using Functions to Set Values jQuery versions 1.4 and higher allow you to set the return value of a function as the property  value. This can be helpful if you need to perform additional steps or calculations to determine  what the value of the property should be.  An example is shown in this code:  The function begins here  $ "my-element" .css "width", function   {   var newWidth;      Perform calculations...   return newWidth; } ;  A variable is defined  Calculations to alter the value of the  variable can be performed here  The value of the variable is returned,  which will set it as the property value  in the css   method  Ask the Expert Q: Does using css  replace the use of addClass  ? A: It can, but whether it needs to depends on your situation. If you don’t have access to  the CSS code of a page, need to quickly add styles that don’t fit an existing class to an  element created via scripting, or just need to test something quickly and add a class to  the CSS code later, then the css   function is a very handy tool to have at your disposal.  It is definitely useful for any on-the-fly changes that may need to be made to an element.  Your choice of css   or addClass   will depend on what you need to accomplish at  the time.  Q: What is with all the array and object talk? Do I need to know advanced JavaScript to   use jQuery after all?  A: No, advanced JavaScript knowledge is not required, but a general understanding of some  of the basic language elements is useful when using jQuery methods. To assist you, the  elements of JavaScript that will help you with jQuery coding  such as variables, functions,  arrays, and objects  will be discussed in the next chapter.  Q: Are there other methods I can use to set property values? A: jQuery offers the width   and height   methods for getting or setting the width and height  properties of an element. The other properties can be set using the css   method or by  adding, removing, or toggling the classes assigned to an element  class methods will be  discussed in the next section .   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  85  In this case, a variable named newWidth is defined, calculations are performed, and the value  of the newWidth variable is returned, which will set it as the value of the width property for the  selected element.  This can be a handy way to calculate or determine a new value for a property. In the next   chapter, you will learn some JavaScript tips that will assist you with making calculations or  using different values based on certain conditions.  Class Methods  The jQuery library offers four methods that can assist you when you need to work with classes,  allowing you to add, remove, and toggle classes, or to see if an element has a particular class.  If you have access to the CSS file for a page, you can use the classes you create to make CSS  alterations easy by using any of the class methods. The addClass   and removeClass   Methods You have been using addClass   already to add classes to elements. The removeClass   method, in contrast, removes a class from an element.  Suppose you had the following HTML code  save as remove.html :               Remove           .unread { font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; }                      This message is important!  Really!                   Mark Read                 You will notice that there is an “important” message being displayed, along with a button that  allows you to mark it as read. When the page is loaded, the imp-msg   will have the class  unread attached to it, which makes the text bold and italic.  Clicking the button would allow you to mark the message as “read.” In this case, removing   the unread class from the   element would take off the bold and italic styles, making the  text appear without any additional styling.   86  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  To remove the class, you can use the removeClass   method, as in the following code  save   as remove.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "read" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-msg" .removeClass "unread" ;   } ; } ;  The removeClass   method will remove  the unread class from the imp-msg   element  Open the remove.html file in your browser. When you click the button, the message should  have the bold and italics that were included in the unread class removed. Figure 4-3 shows the  initial page, and Figure 4-4 shows the page after the button is clicked.  NOTE While this will remove the class now, refreshing the page will cause the message to be  “unread” again. Saving a change like this requires some server-side code in addition to  this. These types of coding techniques will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9. Remove Multiple Classes Just like addClass  , the removeClass   method can be used to remove multiple classes or all  classes from selected elements. Separating multiple class names with spaces will remove each   Figure 4-3  The initial page  Figure 4-4 The page after the button is clicked   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  87  of those classes, while calling the method without an argument will remove all classes. The  following code shows an example of both of these:  $ "my-element" .removeClass "one-class another-class" ; $ "my-element" .removeClass  ;  Removes all classes from the selected element  Removes one-class and another- class from the selected element  Combine addClass   and removeClass   by Chaining jQuery supports method chaining, which allows you to place methods one after another to  act on selected elements. For example, you could chain the addClass   and removeClass   methods to a selection to perform both operations without the need to write the code in two  separate statements.  Consider the following code:  $ "my-element" .removeClass "one-class" ; $ "my-element" .addClass "another-class" ;  The first statement will remove one-class from my-element, and the second statement  will add another-class to the same element. These two statements are performed one after  another.  Instead of writing two separate statements and making the same selection twice, you can   chain the two methods together in a single statement, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .removeClass "one-class" .addClass "another-class" ;  Here, the same effect is achieved with a single statement, and my-element does not need to  be selected a second time. Keep in mind, however, that my-element will need to be selected  again if you need to do something with it later when the new action won’t immediately  follow the current statement.  The toggleClass   Method The toggleClass   method allows you to switch between adding and removing one or more  classes each time the method is applied to a particular selection.  Toggle a Single Class To toggle a single class, simply send the class name as an argument to toggleClass  , as in the  following code:  $ "my-element" .toggleClass "one-class" ;  In this case, if my-element has one-class, then it will be removed; if my-element does not have  one-class, then it will be added.   88  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  You could use this to provide a simple toggle to the user, such as switching the font  size of an element back and forth. Suppose you had the following HTML code  save as  toggle.html :               Toggle           .larger { font-size:2em; }     .imp-text { font-style:italic; }                      This message is important!  Really!                   Toggle Font                 Here, the imp-msg element has a class already applied to it  imp-text  to make the text italic. A  class named larger is available in the CSS code, which can be toggled on the element to allow  the user to switch the font to a larger size and back to the original size as needed.  The following code will toggle the larger class on the imp-msg   element when the   tog-font button is clicked  save as toggle.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "tog-font" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-msg" .toggleClass "larger" ;   } ; } ;  When the button is clicked the first time, the larger class will be added. When it is clicked  again, the larger class will be removed. Each time the button is clicked, the larger class will be  added or removed depending on whether the imp-msg element has the class or not. Figure 4-5  shows the initial page, and Figure 4-6 shows the page after the first button click. Toggle Multiple Classes The toggleClass   method can also be used to toggle multiple classes at once  or all classes ,  much like addClass   and removeClass  .   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  89  Figure 4-5 The initial page  Figure 4-6 The page after the button is clicked the first time, displaying the text in a larger font  If you call the method with no arguments, all classes for the element will be toggled:  $ "my-element" .toggleClass  ;  To toggle multiple classes by name, simply separate each class name with a space when   calling toggleClass  , as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .toggleClass "one-class another-class" ;  In this case, both classes will be added or removed, based on whether the element currently  has each class. Keep in mind that this is done separately for each class, so one-class could be  added while another-class   is removed, this could be switched, or both could be in the same  state and be added or removed at the same time.  For example, go back to the code for the toggle.html page. You will recall that there were   two available classes and one was already applied to the   element:  .larger { font-size:2em; } .imp-text { font-style:italic; }  This class was available, but not  applied until added via jQuery code  This class was applied using the class  attribute in the   element   90  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  To see what happens when both classes are toggled at once, open your toggle.js file and alter it  to use the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "tog-font" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-msg" .toggleClass "larger imp-text" ;   } ; } ;  Save the file and refresh toggle.html in your browser. When the button is clicked, larger will  be added to the imp-msg   element, while imp-text will be removed. Since imp-msg did  not have the larger class, it was added. Since imp-msg already had the imp-text class, it was  removed. Figure 4-7 shows the initial page, and Figure 4-8 shows the page after the button is  clicked.  If you make any changes with jQuery code before the toggle is performed, then it will alter  how the toggle works. For instance, change the toggle.js code to the following and save the file  again:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "imp-msg" .addClass "larger" ;   $ "tog-font" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-msg" .toggleClass "larger imp-text" ;   } ; } ;  Adding the larger class when the  document is ready will change what  happens when the button is clicked  Figure 4-7 The initial page  Figure 4-8 The page after the button is clicked. The text loses the italic font but becomes larger.   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  91  Figure 4-9 The initial page  Figure 4-10 The page after the button is clicked  Here, the larger class is added when the document is ready, so the text will already be larger   and imp-msg will already have the larger class when the button is clicked to toggle the classes.  Thus, both larger and imp-text will be removed on the first click, both added on the second, and so  on. Figure 4-9 shows the initial page, and Figure 4-10 shows the page after the button is clicked. Specifying an Add or Remove If you need to be more specific, you can specify whether toggleClass   should add or remove  a class by sending a second argument. If the value true is sent, then the class will be added; if  false is sent, then the class will be removed:  This ensures that the class is added  $ "my-element" .toggleClass "one-class", true ; $ "my-element" .toggleClass "one-class", false ;  This ensures that the  class is removed  Using a Function to Determine the Argument If you need to determine what class name s  should be sent in the argument through scripting, you  can send the return value of a function as the argument to toggleClass  , as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .toggleClass function  {   var myClasses;      Code to get one or more class names   return myClasses; } ;   92  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  As with the css   method, you can return a value to be used as the argument. In this case, you  will want a single class name or a space-separated list of class names to be returned and used  as the argument.  The hasClass   Method The hasClass   method determines whether or not the elements in a selection have a specified  class. If one or more elements have the class, the method will return a value of true; if not,  false will be returned.  For example, consider the following HTML code snippet:   Are you looking at me?<  div>  The   element has two classes assigned to it: looking and staring. The following code  shows the different values returned by hasClass   given several different arguments:  $ "my-element" .hasClass "looking" ;     returns true $ "my-element" .hasClass "staring" ;     returns true $ "my-element" .hasClass "gazing" ;     returns false  If hasClass   is run on a collection of elements, then it will return true if one or more   elements within the selection have the class, and false if none of the elements in the selection  have the class. Consider this example code:   Are you looking at me?   Are you looking at me?   Are you looking at me?   The following code shows the result of using different class names as the argument to  hasClass  :  $ "div" .hasClass "looking" ;     returns true  1st and 2nd    $ "div" .hasClass "staring" ;     returns true  1st and 3rd    $ "div" .hasClass "gazing" ;     returns false  no   with the  class   This can be used with a JavaScript if statement to selectively perform an action based on   whether an element has a given class. The structure of an if statement is shown in the following  code:  if  value  {      Code to perform is value is true }  The value is typically a statement that evaluates to either true or false. The code within the  curly brackets will only execute if the value within the parentheses evaluates to true  you will  learn more about using the if statement in the next chapter .   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  93  In the case of hasClass  , it will return true if one or more of the selected elements has the   specified class, so you can use the method in the if statement to execute the code inside the  curly brackets if it returns true. Consider the following code:   Are you looking at me?   Given these   elements, you could execute a statement like the one in the following code:  This statement will evaluate to true since the element has the  staring class, so the code inside the curly brackets will be executed  if  $ "see" .hasClass "staring"   {   $ "see" .css "font-size", "2em" ; }  This statement executes, making  the font size of the element larger  As you can see, hasClass   will return true in this case, so the statement inside the curly  brackets will be executed, and the   element will have its font size increased. Had gazing been sent as the argument instead, hasClass   would have returned false, and any code within  the curly brackets would have been ignored.  CAUTION When working with if, be careful that you keep its parentheses separate from those of  the jQuery methods. Both need to be closed, so be sure to double-check that the outer  and inner sets of parentheses are all closed to avoid potential script errors.

When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "highlight" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "imp-text" .toggleClass "highlight" ;   } ;   $ "make-bold" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "more-info" .css "font-weight", "bold" ;   } ; } ;  5. Open the pr04-01.html file in your Web browser. Click the first button, and the important   text should become highlighted. Click the second button, and the additional text should  become bold  clicking this button again will have no further effects .  Try This Summary  In this project, you practiced using both the toggleClass   and css   jQuery methods to add  remove a class as needed and to change the value of a CSS property on an element.   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  95  Size and Position Methods  Sometimes it is helpful to be able to get positional CSS property values, since they may be  useful when positioning an element on the screen or giving an element a particular width,  height, border, padding, and so on.  The jQuery library has a number of methods for obtaining different values that can help  you in your scripts. Some of the methods only retrieve information, but others also serve as  shorthand methods for setting property values.  NOTE When using these methods to get or set values, the selection process works like that of  the css   method. The first matched element is selected when getting values, while all matched elements are changed when setting values. The width   and height   Methods The width   and height   methods can get or set the width or height of an element. When getting  a value, you simply call one of the methods with no arguments, as in the following code:  var eWidth = $ "my-element" .width  ;  This gets the width of my-element and assigns it to a variable named eWidth. The value it gets  will be the width in pixels, without the string “px” attached to the end of it. This can make  it easier to perform calculations on the returned value, as opposed to the value returned by  css “width” , which would need to have the “px” string removed from the end to perform any  numerical calculations.  The width and height values for an element are the width and height of the element before any padding, borders, or margins are added. You will see as you progress that there are other  methods for determining the width and height based on different rules.  To set a value, you send the methods an argument with the new value. This can be any   string such as “40”, “20px”, “2em”, “50%”, and so on. If you use a number without providing  the unit behind it, then jQuery will assume it is a pixel value. Some examples are shown here:  $ "my-element" .width "45" ;   Sets the width to 45px $ "my-element" .width "22px" ;   Sets the width to 22px $ "my-element" .width "40%" ;   Sets the width to 40% $ "my-element" .width "5em" ;   Sets the width to 45em  Each of these is valid and will set the width accordingly. The height   method works the same  way as width   but sets the height of the element instead. The innerWidth   and innerHeight   Methods The innerWidth   and innerHeight   methods get the width or height of an element plus its  padding, in pixels. The borders and margins are not included in this value. For example,  suppose you had the following CSS code:  my-element { width:20; height:100; padding:10px; }   96  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The examples in the following code show what is returned by both methods when they are   called for my-element:  var eIWidth = $ "my-element" .innerWidth  ;    eIWidth = 40 var eIHeight = $ "my-element" .innerWidth  ;    eIHeight = 120  Notice that when the shorthand padding property is used, it adds the specified padding value to  all sides of the element, so calling innerWidth  , for example, will include the width  20 , plus  the left padding  10 , plus the right padding  10 , for a total of 40. The call to innerHeight   works the same way  100 + 10 + 10 = 120 . The outerWidth   and outerHeight   Methods The outerWidth   and outerHeight   properties get the width or height of an element plus  its padding and border, in pixels. The margins are not included in this value. For example,  suppose you had the following CSS code:  my-element { width:20; height:100; padding:10px; border:1px; }  The examples in this code show what is returned by both methods when they are called for   my-element:  var eOWidth = $ "my-element" .outerWidth  ;    eOWidth = 42 var eOHeight = $ "my-element" .outerWidth  ;    eOHeight = 122  These methods also provide an option for you to include the margin along with the   padding and border. This is done by sending the value of true as an argument to innerWidth   or innerHeight  .  Suppose you had the following CSS code:  my-element { width:20; height:100; padding:10px; border:1px;  margin:5px; }  The examples in the following code show what is returned by both methods when they are   called for my-element using the optional argument to include the margin values:  var eOWidth = $ "my-element" .outerWidth true ;    eOWidth = 52 var eOHeight = $ "my-element" .outerWidth true ;    eOHeight = 132  This can be helpful when you need to know how much space an element will use on the screen. The offset   Method The offset   method allows you to get or set the left and top coordinates of an element on the  page relative to the document element. This means that the coordinates are defined where  0,0   is at the top-left of the page.   Chapter 4: Working with Styles  97  Getting the Offset To get the offset of an element, you can call the offset method without any arguments, as in the  following code:  var oSet = $ "my-element" .offset  ;  The method returns two values, the width and the height, which can be accessed by including  .left or .top after the variable name that is assigned the result  it returns an object with the  properties left and top . Assuming my-element was positioned at  20, 30 , the following code  shows examples of the results of calling offset   on the element:  var oSet = $ "my-element" .offset  ; $ "another-element" .append oSet.left ;    oSet.left = 20 $ "another-element" .append oSet.top ;    oSet.top = 30  Setting the Offset To set the offset of an element, you send the left and top values as an argument using object  literal notation, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .offset {left: 40, top: 50} ;  This will move the element to the coordinates  40, 50  on the page.  NOTE If the element has a position value set to anything other than relative, then this method  will reset it to relative in order to perform the repositioning of the element. The position   Method The position   method works like the offset   method, but gets or sets the position of an  element based on its parent element. This keeps you from needing to find the position of  the parent element and then set the position of the element. Instead, you can simply use the  position   method.  For example, the code here shows examples of getting or setting an element’s coordinates   using the position   method:  var pos = $ "my-element" .position  ; $ "another-element" .append pos.left ; $ "another-element" .append pos.top ; $ "my-element" .position {left: 10, top: 10} ;  NOTE If the element has a position value set to anything other than relative, then this method  will reset it to relative in order to perform the repositioning of the element.   98  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The scrollLeft   and scrollTop   Methods The scrollLeft   and scrollTop   methods get or set the position of the horizontal and vertical  scroll bars, in pixels. For example, to get the position of the horizontal scroll bar, you could use  the following code:  var scrollPosHz = $ "my-element" .scrollLeft  ;  If you want to set the position, you simply send the pixel value as the argument, as in the   following code:  $ "my-element" .scrollLeft 20 ;  This would cause the scroll bar to be positioned 20 pixels from the left edge of the element.  To see how you could use one of the scroll methods, suppose you had the following HTML   code  save as scroll.html :               Scroll          text-box { border:1px solid 000; width:50px; height:100px;     overflow:scroll; }                          This is a story that I have been meaning to write for some    time.     It all started long ago, when I decided to try writing HTML for the      first time. I thought I would never get my Web site to work, but       then...                       Scroll down to 270px                  Chapter 4: Working with Styles  99  This will create a bordered text box with a vertical scroll bar to scroll through the remaining  text. You can move the position of the scroll bar using scrollTop  , as in the following code   save as scroll.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "scroll-box" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "text-box" .scrollTop 270 ;   } ; } ;  This will move the vertical scroll bar position down 270 pixels from the top of the text-box element. In this case, that will be somewhere near the beginning of the second paragraph  the  exact position will depend on your default font size, and so on . Figure 4-11 shows the initial  page, and Figure 4-12 shows the page after the button is clicked.  As you can see, the scroll bar is repositioned and the text is scrolled down to the new   position.

This knowledge can help you better understand   jQuery syntax, and can also help you when you need to do things such as use variables, make  comparisons, write custom functions, and so on.  In this chapter, you will learn some of the basic constructs in JavaScript. This won’t go  into as much detail on these topics as a book specifically for JavaScript, but will give you an  overview of these basic constructs so that you can apply them in jQuery.  You will also learn about the Document Object Model  DOM  and how to use jQuery to   add, move, or remove elements from the DOM tree.  Basic JavaScript  There are a number of things used in JavaScript that are helpful to know when coding  jQuery, since the library returns particular types of values from its methods, uses syntax from  JavaScript, and allows you to provide your own function code.  In this section, you will learn about JavaScript comments, variables, data types, operators,   flow control statements, functions, arrays, and objects. Understanding the basic concepts  behind these features of the JavaScript language will prove helpful when you need to use them  with your jQuery code.  NOTE This will be a high-level overview of these concepts for you to better understand them  when they are used with jQuery. If you want to learn JavaScript in more detail, refer to  one of the resources provided in Chapter 1.  If you are already familiar with the basics of JavaScript, feel free to proceed to the section   entitled “The Document Object Model  DOM ” as you will likely know the information that  follows already. Comments Comments allow you to place characters into your JavaScript code that are ignored by the  JavaScript interpreter. These are often descriptive comments about the code, but they can also  be used to disable pieces of code when needed.   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  107  JavaScript allows for both single-line and multiple-line comments. A single-line comment  begins with two forward slashes      and ends at the end of the line. For example, the following  code shows a single-line comment:     This is a comment!  The comment can begin anywhere on the line, so you may see code like the following as well:  var guitars = 2;    Stores the number of guitars on hand  In this case, the code at the beginning of the line will still run, but the text after the    is ignored. A multiple-line comment begins with  * and does not end until *  is found in the code. For   example, the following code shows a comment that runs over several lines, all of which are  ignored by the JavaScript interpreter:   * This is ignored var y = 2; this is also ignored and not run nothing to see here... *   The comment only ends when the ending *  characters appear in the code. Variables and Data Types In the last chapter, you saw values being assigned to variables. A variable simply stores a value  in memory. This value can be used or changed in your code as needed. Declaring Variables JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare a variable. The only requirements for declaring  a variable are to use the var keyword and to provide a valid variable name. For example, the  following code would declare a variable named guitars:  var guitars;  If you want to declare multiple variables in a single statement, you can separate the   variable names with commas, as in the following code:  var guitars, pianos, trumpets;  When doing this, remember to use a semicolon after the last variable name in the list to end the  statement.  When declaring a variable in this manner, you are not explicitly assigning it a value. In   such cases, variables are assigned an initial value of undefined by JavaScript. If you want  to give the variable a different initial value, you can assign it by adding an equal sign  =   followed by the desired value, as in the following code:  var guitars = 2;  This assigns a value of 2 to the variable guitars.   108  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  As with the basic variable declaration, you can declare and assign values to   multiple variables by separating each with a comma. The following code shows an  example of this:  var guitars = 2, pianos = 1, trumpets = 3;  Here, all three variables are given initial values. If the list becomes longer, it is often coded  with each variable assignment on its own line to make it easier to scan, as shown in the  following example code:  var guitars = 2,      pianos = 1,      trumpets = 3;  Remember to include the semicolon at the end of the list!  Here, all three variable assignments appear on their own line in the code, and you can quickly  scan down vertically if you need to find one of the variable assignments at a later time. Using Variables To use a variable, you need only place the variable name in your code to use its value. For  example, the following code sends a pop-up alert to the user with the value of the guitars variable:  var guitars = 2; alert guitars ;  Notice that the variable name does not use quote marks around it  This uses the JavaScript alert   method, which sends the user a pop-up dialog with the content  contained in the argument  the value of the guitars variable in this case, which is 2 . You will  notice that when a JavaScript variable is used, quote marks are not used around the variable  name. Naming Variables Variables must begin with a letter, underscore  _ , or dollar symbol  $ , and each character  after that must be a letter, number, underscore, or dollar symbol. The following code shows  some examples:  var cool;    Valid var _cool$beans2;    Valid var $cool;    Valid var 2cool;    Invalid – cannot begin with a number var cool beans; Invalid – cannot contain a space var %cool;    Invalid - % character not allowed  Another thing you need to know is that JavaScript keywords and reserved words such   as if, var, function, and so on should not be used as variable names, as they could potentially    Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  109  cause a script to malfunction. For a complete list, see www.scripttheweb.com js ref javascript- reserved-words . JavaScript Data Types JavaScript has five basic data types, outlined in Table 5-1.  JavaScript does not differentiate between integers, floats, doubles, and so on. Instead,   any number simply falls under the number data type. Boolean values are either true or false, making them effective values for comparison operations  discussed later in this chapter . The  undefined and null types describe undefined variables and empty objects  objects are discussed  later in this chapter . This leaves string values, which can be a bit tricky at times. Working with Strings As you have seen previously, string values are placed in quotes. For  example, to assign a string value to a variable, you could use the following code:  This assigns the string “Frank” to the name variable.  A string can be placed in single or double quotes without any differences, so the following   var name = "Frank";  code would also be perfectly valid:  var name = 'Frank';  If you need quote marks within other quote marks, you will need to either switch between  single and double or to escape the additional quotes with backslashes  \ . For example, any of  the examples in the following code would be valid:  var text = "Frank said, 'Great!'"; var text2 = 'Frank said, "Great!"'; var text3 = "Don't do that!";  Type Number  String Boolean  Undefined  Description Any numeric value. Includes integer, float, and so on. Some examples: 5, -2, 3.5,  123.32345677, 5.65e21  exponential notation . A string of text, such as “Hi”, “Bye”, “This is a sentence.”, and so on. true or false—These values are literal values and do not need quote marks around  them as string values would. A value that has not yet been defined. For example, declaring a variable without  assigning it an initial value and using it will result in a value of undefined.  Null  The value of an empty object. Similar to undefined, but for objects.  Table 5-1    JavaScript Data Types   110  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Each of these contains one type of quote mark to enclose the string and uses the other within  the string. Problems arise, however, if the same type of quote used to enclose the string is used  within the string, as in the following code examples:  var text = "Frank said, "Great!"";  var text2 = 'Frank said, 'Great!''; var text3 = 'Don't do that!';  Both of these end the string before the G  in Great due to the matching enclosing  quote appearing there  This string is ended before the t in Don’t due to  the matching enclosing quote there  The strings will produce a JavaScript error when you try to run the code.  If you decide you would rather escape the inner quote marks rather than alternate, the   strings could be fixed using the following code:  var text = "Frank said, \"Great!\"";  var text2 = 'Frank said, \'Great!\''; var text3 = 'Don\'t do that!';  Notice that any quote marks that match the enclosing quote marks are preceded by  a backslash. This will keep them from ending the string and producing errors. In some  situations, this will be required since alternating has already been done. Consider the  following example:  var text = 'Frank said, "Don\'t do that!"';  By the time you get to the single quote in the word Don’t, you have already alternated quote  marks, and single quotes are being used to enclose the string. Here, the backslash before the t is required for the string to be valid. Operators JavaScript includes a number of operators that allow you to perform calculations, assign  values, compare values, and more. These are helpful to know in jQuery, since you will often  need to perform one or more of these operations in your scripts. Arithmetic The JavaScript arithmetic operators are shown in Table 5-2.  Most operations will work as expected, as seen in the following code examples:  var num = 2 + 3;       num = 5 var num2 = 4 – 2;      num2 = 2 var num3 = ++num2;     num3 = 3 var num4 = 1 * 0;      num4 = 0   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  111  Operator Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Modulus Increment Decrement Unary Plus Unary Negation  Symbol + - *   % ++ -- + -  Description Adds two values Subtracts one value from another Multiplies two values Divides one value by another Returns the remainder of dividing one value by another Adds one to a number Subtracts one from a number Attempts to convert non-numeric values into numbers Alters the sign of a number  Table 5-2 Arithmetic Operators  When using the addition operator, you have to watch out for numbers and strings being   combined. Since the + operator is also used to combine  concatenate  strings, unexpected  results can occur. For example, consider the following code:  var num = 2,      num2 =  "4",      num3 = num + num2;  The value of num3 is “24”!  Here, a number and a string are added together and the result is assigned to the num3 variable.  You may think adding these two values would cause an error, but that is not the case. When  JavaScript sees this, it attempts to perform type coercion, which means it will attempt to make  one of the values match the data type of the other.  In the case of numbers and strings being added, JavaScript will coerce the number into   a string value  “2” in this case  before performing the operation. If you know that the string  value consists of only numbers, you can correct this by using the unary plus operator  + .  This will attempt to coerce a string to a number first, and then the data types will both be  numbers before the addition operation is attempted. The following code would give num3 a  value of 6:  var num = 2,      num2 =  "4",      num3 = num + +num2;  Notice the + immediately preceding the num2 variable  value here, which will attempt to coerce the value to a  number before it is added to the num value.   112  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  If the string value did not consist of only numeric characters, then num2 is given the special  value of NaN, which means “Not a Number.” When this is added to another value, the result  will be NaN. Thus, if “4” is changed to “4something,” this workaround will simply cause a  result of NaN.  If you know that the string at least begins with numeric characters, you can use the   parseInt   or parseFloat   JavaScript methods to get the numeric characters from the beginning  of the screen  parseFloat   allows the first period  .  it encounters to be treated as a decimal  point . So, the following code would also allow you to have a value of 6 for the num3 variable:  var num = 2,      num2 =  "4something",      num3 = num + parseInt num2 ;  The num2 variable is sent as an argument to parseInt  , which removes the non-numeric  characters after the numerical 4 at the beginning of the string  NOTE This type of issue can often occur when the user fills in a number in an HTML form field,  which is sent to JavaScript code as a string value. Depending on the situation, using the  unary plus or parseInt   method should allow you to validate that a number has been  entered and to convert the value to a number for calculations. Assignment The assignment operators are listed in Table 5-3.  The equal sign  =  simply assigns a value to a variable, as in the following code:  var num = 4; num = 5;     num = 5  The variable is assigned a new value of 5  Operator Assignment Add and Assign  Symbol = +=  Subtract and Assign  Multiply and Assign  Divide and Assign  Modulus and Assign  -=  *=   =  %=  Table 5-3    Assignment Operators  Description Assigns a value to a variable Adds the value on the right to the current value of the  variable and assigns the variable the new value Subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the  variable and assigns the variable the new value Multiplies the value on the right by the current value of the  variable and assigns the variable the new value Divides the current value of the variable by the value on the  right and assigns the variable the new value Divides the current value of the variable by the value on the  right and assigns the variable the value of the remainder   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  113  The others perform an operation on the current value of the variable and assign the result  as the new value of the variable. For example, the Add and Assign operator will add the value  on the right side of it to the value of the variable on the left side, then assign the result as the  new value of the variable, as in the following code:  var num = 4; num += 5;     num = 9  4+5   These assignment operators are typically used as shorthand for writing out the equivalent  calculation  in this case, num = num + 5 . Comparison Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value of true or  false. This is often used with the if statement  and other flow control statements  to determine  whether or not to run particular sections of code. The comparison operators are shown in  Table 5-4.  In the case of an if statement, you can compare two values to determine if the block of   code within the curly brackets should be run, as in the following code:  var num = 2;  if  num === 3  {      Code to execute... }  The comparison returns false, so the code  within the curly brackets is ignored  Operator Is equal to  Strict is equal to  Is not equal to   Strict is not equal to  Is greater than  Is greater than or equal to  Is less than  Is less than or equal to  ===  !=  !==  >  <  >=  <=  Table 5-4    Comparison Operators  Symbol ==  Description Returns true if the values on both sides are equal  Returns true if the values on both sides are equal  and of the same data type Returns true if the values on both sides are not  equal Returns true if the values on both sides are not  equal or not of the same data type Returns true if the value on the left is greater  than the value on the right Returns true if the value on the left is greater  than or equal to the value on the right Returns true if the value on the left is less than  the value on the right Returns true if the value on the left is less than or  equal to the value on the right   114  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Here, the code will only execute if the value of num is equal to 3. Since the value of num is 2, the comparison returns false and the code within the curly brackets is not executed.  The others work in much the same way and will return true or false once the comparison is  made.  NOTE The strict equal to operator is used here, as this has become a best practice when  making an equality comparison. The == operator allows for type coercion, which can  yield unexpected results. Logical Logical operators allow you to combine comparisons to form a more complex statement that  will, in the end, return true or false. The logical operators are listed in Table 5-5.  As an example, if you want to make sure two comparisons are both true before executing a   block of code, you could use the && operator, as in the following code:  var num = 2; if    num > 0  &&  num < 5    {      Code to execute... }  Since both num > 0 and num < 5 return true, the whole operation returns true and the code  within the curly brackets is executed.  The ! operator will simply negate the result of a comparison, making it true if it returned   false and false if it returned true. For example, consider the following code:  var num = 2; if   ! num < 1    {      Code to execute... }  The comparison num < 1 returns false, but placing the ! operator in front of it will now cause  the result to be true. It is essentially saying “If it is not the case, then the value of num is less  than 1,” which is true, since 2 is not less than 1.  Operator AND OR NOT  Symbol &&  !  Description Returns true if the comparisons on both sides return true Returns true if either one or both of the comparisons returns true Returns true if a comparison returns false, and vice versa  Table 5-5 Logical Operators   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  115  Flow Control Statements Flow control statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions being met. You  have already used the if statement, but there are a few more basic statements that you may  want to learn as well. The if else Statement You have used the if statement already to execute code only when a condition returns true, but you can optionally add an else statement directly afterward that will execute when the  condition returns false. For example, consider the following code:  var num = 2; if  num === 3  {      Code to execute if true... } else {      Code to execute if false... }  This comparison will return false, since 2 is not equal to 3  The code within these curly brackets  will be executed since the comparison  returned false  The else statement allows you to provide an alternate set of statements to execute when the  condition in an if statement does not return true. This allows you to customize your code even  further when needed. The for Loop A loop is a block of code that is executed a particular number of times based on information  provided in the statement. The for loop allows you to provide an initial value for a counting  variable, a condition to test on that variable, and an expression that will increase or decrease  the value of that count variable.  For example, take a look at the following code:  for  var num = 0; num < 10; num++  {   Code to execute as long as the value of num is less than 9...  }  Each of the three statements is separated by a semicolon. Notice that a variable can be  initialized in the first statement within the parentheses. Typically, the variable is initialized to  a value of 0 because loops often cycle through arrays, which begin with an index of zero  you  will see more about this later in the chapter .  The next statement determines when the loop will end. In this case, as long as the value of   num is less than 10, the code within the curly brackets will execute again.  The last statement changes the value of the variable after each execution of the loop. In this   case, 1 is added to the value of num each time the loop is run. Thus, the first time through the  loop, num will be 0, the second time num will be 1, and so on. When num finally reaches 10,   116  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  the loop will no longer be executed and the script will proceed to the next line of code  following the loop. Functions Functions provide a way for you to reuse code that is created for a particular purpose. You  have been using functions in your jQuery code already—from executing a function when the  document is ready to running one when an event occurs. Expression and Declaration To this point, you have been using what is known as a function expression in JavaScript, which  is also often called an anonymous function. The following shows the basic syntax of a function  expression:  var ref = function   {      Code to execute when run... };  Notice that the function is assigned to some type of reference, which in this case is a variable  name. This function could later be called using ref  , though ref is a reference to the function  rather than a function name, which can only occur when using a function declaration. This is  why it is often called an anonymous function.  A better example is to look at how you have been using function expressions up to this   point—to handle events, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .click function event  {   event.preventDefault  ;   $ "other-element" .addClass "myClass" ; } ;  Here, the function expression is not assigned to a reference name, but to handle an event. The  only time this function is executed is when the event occurs, rather than having the ability to be  called from elsewhere in the script.  A function declaration allows you to name the function and call it anywhere in the script.   The following code shows the basic syntax of a function declaration:  function funcName   {      Code to execute... }  When declaring a function, you begin with the function keyword, followed by the function  name. The code to execute is placed inside the curly brackets, just as with a function  expression.  Using a declaration, you can call a declared function directly at any time by simply using   the function name followed by parentheses, as in the following code:  function sendAlert   {   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  117    alert "Hi!" ; } sendAlert  ;  If you want to assign the function to handle an event, you leave off the parentheses when  assigning it, so that the function itself is assigned to handle the event  otherwise, it is assumed  you want to run the function and or return the result of it . The following code shows an  example of this:  function sendAlert   {   alert "Hi!" ; } $ "my-element" .click sendAlert ;  Here, the sendAlert   function is assigned to handle the click event on my-element, and  will pop up the alert message when the event occurs. The only issue here is that you cannot  send any arguments, so any values needed have to be gathered within the function itself. The  function can, however, be reused as many times as needed by simply calling or assigning it  again.  Function expressions are often used to handle events in jQuery, since event reactions   are not typically reused by other elements and since you can easily add any needed  arguments. Arguments and Return Values You have been using arguments already. These are simply values that are passed on to a  function, which can then be used within the function. Each argument is separated by a comma  and enclosed in the parentheses following the function keyword  for expressions  or the  function name  for declarations .  You have been passing the Event object as an argument to allow you to use the   preventDefault   method, but any value can be used as an argument. Numbers, strings, Boolean  values, variables, arrays, objects, and more can be sent as arguments to a function. Consider  the following code:  A variable named num is assigned a value of 5  var num = 5;  $ "my-element" .click function event, num  {   event.preventDefault  ;   if  num < 5  {     $ "other-element" .addClass "myClass" ;   }   else {     alert "Sorry, the number is too large to add the class!" ;   } } ;  Both event and num are sent  as arguments to the function  that handles the click event  This code is executed if the value  of num is less than 5  This code is executed if the value  of num is not less than 5   118  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Here, the value of the num variable is sent as an argument and then used to determine which  statements to execute using an if else statement.  Functions can also return values. For example, you saw an example of this in Chapter 4   when using a function as an argument to the css   method, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .css "width", function   {   var curWidth = parseInt $ "my-element" .css "width"  ,        newWidth = curWidth * 3;   return newWidth; } ;  The value returned from the function is used as the new value for the width property.   In this case, the function assigns the current width of the element to a variable named  curWidth, then multiplies it by 3 and assigns the result to a variable named newWidth. The  value of newWidth is then returned from the function to be set as the new value of the CSS  width property.  Notice that parseInt   was used to get the numeric value from the pixel width  otherwise,   it would be “100px,” which cannot be multiplied . It returns the new width as a number, which  jQuery implements as a pixel value. Arrays An array allows you to store a list of data. This data can be accessed by using an index number,  starting from 0. In jQuery, array literal notation is typically used when defining arrays. Defining Arrays In JavaScript, you can define an array in array literal notation as shown in the following code:  var arrayName = [item0, item1, item2];  It starts out looking like a typical variable, but the square brackets define the value as an array.  Each array item is separated by a comma, but the last item in the array does not have a comma  after it. Here, an array named arrayName is defined with three items.  An array can be defined with no items  empty  and added to later, or you can add as many   items as you need by including them in the list. The following code defines one empty array  and one array with four items:  var myMoney = []; var randomStuff = [2, true, "hi", -3.457 ];  As you can see, JavaScript does not require data in an array to be all of the same data type,  so you can have numbers, strings, Boolean values, objects, and even other arrays within  an array.   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  119  Accessing Items in Arrays To access items in an array, you simply use the array name followed by brackets, which  include the index of the item you need. Arrays begin counting at zero, so the first item in an  array will be at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.  The following code shows examples of accessing items in an array:  var randomStuff = [2, true, "hi", -3.457 ]; var num = randomStuff[0];    num = 2 var result = randomStuff[1];    result = true var greet = randomStuff[2];    greet = "Hi" var negNum = randomStuff[3];    negNum = -3.457  As you can see, this allows for easy access to any item in the list; you need only remember to  begin counting at zero rather than one.  Array Length It can be useful to know the length of an array, and JavaScript provides the length property for  arrays to provide you with that information. The length property contains the number of items  in an array. For example, consider the following code:  var randomStuff = [2, true, "hi", -3.457 ]; var numItems = randomStuff.length;    numItems = 4  Since the array contains four items, the value of its length property is 4.  This information is often used to loop through each item in an array and execute code   based on the value of each item. For example, the following code will alert the value of each  item in the array to the user:  var randomStuff = [2, true, "hi", -3.457 ]; for  var i = 0; i < randomStuff.length; i++  {   alert randomStuff[i] ; }  The value of the length property is used here to have the  loop stop running after the last item in the array has been  cycled through  Notice how the counting variable  i  is initialized to 0, which is the first item of an array. The  loop then runs until i is no longer less than the length of the array. Here, the loop will go from  item 0 through item 3  the fourth item  and then stop. In this way, you can easily cycle through  any array, regardless of its length.  Objects Objects are similar to arrays, in that they provide a list—but rather than using an index, an  object is a list of name value pairs. They can be used for many things, such as encapsulating    120  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  code and building patterns with constructors and prototypes, but for the purposes of this book,  we will simply look at object literal notation at this time. Defining Objects To define an object using object literal notation, the syntax looks like the following code:  var objectName = { property: value, property: value }  You can have as many property value pairs as needed, each separated by a comma. The  property and value in each pair are separated by a colon  : .  As with arrays, the values can be of any type, but the property names must be unquoted   string values, as in the following code:  var myCar = { type: "Sedan", engine: "V4", seats: "Cloth" }  You may recall that when using the jQuery css   method, property names could be within quotes.  This is because jQuery converts these to the proper value for you. This allows you to use an object  while also using the more familiar CSS syntax for property names, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .css {   "color": "FFFFFF",    "background-color": "000000" } ;  $ "my-element" .css {   color: "FFFFFF",    backgroundColor: "000000" } ;  The jQuery library does support the use of CSS properties in their JavaScript form, so if   you prefer it, you can use that form instead, as in the following code:  Working with Objects When you need to get the value of a property in JavaScript, you can simply follow the object  name with a dot  .  followed by the property name, as in the following code:  var myCar = { type: "Sedan", engine: "V4", seats: "Cloth" } var carType = myCar.type;         carType = "Sedan" var carEngine = myCar.engine;     carEngine = "V4" var carSeats = myCar.seats;       carSeats = "Cloth"  This syntax makes it easy to access any properties within the object by name when needed.   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  121  Ask the Expert Q: That sure is a lot of JavaScript! Do I really need to know all of that? A: While you won’t necessarily use a lot of JavaScript when coding in jQuery, it is still good  to understand the basic syntax used since jQuery makes use of this syntax in many cases  as well. Other times, you may decide you need an if statement, a variable, an array, or  something else, and it is good to have that knowledge when you need to make use of one  or more of these features.  Q: Doesn’t jQuery iterate over objects on its own? Do I need to know the for loop? A: In most cases, jQuery takes care of looping for you, such as when the $   function selects   elements. Recall that if the selection returns more than one element, then many jQuery  methods will act on all of the elements in the selection when executed by running a loop  behind the scenes for you. jQuery also has an each   method that loops through items, so  for the most part you won’t need to use a JavaScript for loop, but it is good to understand  how it works in case you should need it.   Q: You can’t possibly sum up all of JavaScript in such a short section, right? A: No, there are many more details on these concepts that can be covered, plus many   additional features. Since the focus of this book is primarily on using jQuery, detailed  analyses of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are not possible. The resources listed in Chapter 1  can help you if you find you would like to learn any of these languages in more detail.  Try This 5-1  Use JavaScript with jQuery  pr05-01.html pr05-01.js  This project allows you to practice using the jQuery css   combined with some  JavaScript to react to an event and change the width of a   element.  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr05-01.html:               Project 5-1    continued    122  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide          box { width:100px; border:solid 1px 000; }                     The width of this box can be changed! Click the button below!              Change Size             2. In the pr05-01.js file, add jQuery JavaScript code that will change the size of the box     element to four times its current width when the change-size button is clicked. Hint:  Remember to use the JavaScript parseInt   method!  3. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "change-size" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "box" .css "width", function   {       var curWidth = parseInt $ "box" .css "width"  ,            newWidth = curWidth * 4;       return newWidth;     } ;   } ; } ;  4. Open the pr05-01.html file in your Web browser. Click the button and the size of the box   should change. If you continue clicking the button, the width of the box will keep growing.  Try This Summary  In this project, you practiced using jQuery methods along with a native JavaScript method.  With the basic JavaScript knowledge you now have, you can effectively use the JavaScript  features you have learned when needed.   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  123  Figure 5-1    Example document node structure  The Document Object Model  DOM   The Document Object Model  DOM  gives languages access to the structure of a document. A  document is made up of a series of nodes. For example, consider the following piece of HTML  code:     My Page       Each element is an element node and can contain child nodes. For instance, the    element in this code example is a node with two child nodes:   and  . In addition to  elements, text within elements and attributes create text and attribute nodes, respectively.  Figure 5-1 shows an example of the node structure of this document. Notice how each   node is represented.  This is the structure used by jQuery to access the elements that you select with the $    function. It goes through and finds each matching node, then returns a jQuery object that  contains each of those nodes to allow you to perform any needed actions.  The DOM and jQuery  The jQuery library includes a number of methods to make DOM traversal and manipulation  easier for you than it would be in JavaScript. jQuery gives you methods to create, remove,  move, wrap, or copy elements as needed. Attributes jQuery allows you to set, add, or remove attributes and to get or set values for those attributes  using the attr   method. Like css  , it can contain one argument to get the value of an attribute,  can set values one at a time with two arguments, or can send an object literal to set multiple  attribute values at once. Getting Attribute Values To get an attribute value, you simply invoke the attr   method with a single argument: the  name of the attribute. This will get the value of that attribute for the first matched element, as  in the following code:  var attrValue = $ "my-element" .attr "title" ;   124  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  This  would  get  the  value  of  the  title  attribute  for  my-element  and  assign  that  value  to  the  attrValue variable.  When you have a selection that matches more than one element, only the value of the first  element is returned when using the attr   method  just like with the css   method . In cases where  a jQuery method does not get executed for every matched element, you can use the jQuery each   method, which will tell jQuery to explicitly run a function on all of the matches for a selection.  Suppose you have the following HTML code  save as get-attrs.html :               Get Attributes          desc { width:40%; border:solid 1px 000; }                      To whom it may concern:     I am very pleased with your product and would buy it  again!     Thanks!             Notice that there are three   elements, so a selection of $ "p"  will match all three of the  elements. Using $ "p" .attr "title"  will only return the value of the title attribute for the first    element, which is Intro.  Suppose you would like to get the value of the title attribute for all of the   elements   rather than just the first and then display these values within the desc   element that  follows them. Calling the each   method will allow you to iterate over each of the matched    elements and execute a function for each of them. The following code shows an example  of this:  $ "p" .each function   {        Code to get attribute values } ;  This code essentially says, “Execute the following function for each element that matches the  selection.” You can now add the code to get the value of the title attribute of each matched element.  With this in place, you will still need to be able to select the right element each time the  function is executed. Since $ "p" .attr "title"  would only get the first value, you will want  to change the selection to one that will get the title attribute value of the   element that is  currently having the each   method run on it.   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  125  To do this, you can make use of a special selection in jQuery: $ this . Using $ this   will always refer to the current element in the iteration. In this case, the first time each   is executed, $ this  will be the first   element. The second time each   is executed, $ this  will  be the second   element, and so on. With this information, you know that you can always  get the value of the title attribute of the current matched   element within the each   method  by using the following code:  $ this .attr "title"   Having this at hand, you can now append the value of each of the title attributes to the   desc element by selecting the desc element, calling the append   method, and sending it the  value of the current title attribute, as shown in the following code  save as get-attrs.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "p" .each function   {     $ "desc" .append $ this .attr "title"  + " " ;   } ; } ;  Notice that the argument to the append   method is the value of the title attribute for the currently  matched element followed by an HTML line break  the JavaScript + operator is used to add  the “ ” string after the attribute value . Open the get-attrs.html file in your browser and  you should see the desc   element below the paragraphs displaying the value of the title  attributes for all three   elements. Figure 5-2 shows how this page would appear in a browser. Setting Attribute Values The attr   method can also be used to set values. To set the value for a single attribute, you can  simply provide the attribute name as the first argument and the value as the second argument, as  in the following code:  $ "my-element" .attr "title", "Descriptive Title" ;  This will set the value of the title attribute to Descriptive Title.  Figure 5-2     The result of using each   to get the title attribute for all of the   elements   126  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  NOTE When an attribute that is not already present in an element is set using attr  , the  specified attribute will be added to the element and given the specified value. If the selection contains more than one matched element, attr   will set the specified  attribute and value for all of the matched elements.  If you want to set more than one attribute value at a time, you can use an object literal as   the argument to the attr   method, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .attr {   "title": "Descriptive Title",    "rel": "section"  } ;  $ "my-element" .attr {   title: "Descriptive Title",    rel: "section"  } ;  This would set both the title and rel attributes for the element. With the attr   method, only  the class attribute must be enclosed within quotes when using an object literal. Other attribute  names allow you the option to leave off the quote marks if desired, as in the following code:  Keep in mind, however, that the values will still need to be enclosed within quote marks.  As with other methods, when attr   is executed to set attribute values on a selection that  has more than one match, the attribute will be set for all matches. For example, suppose you  had the following HTML code  save as set-attrs.html :               Set Attributes          navbox { width:40%; border:solid 1px 000; }                            About        Services        Contact            Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  127  Suppose you want all of the   elements in the navbox element to have a title attribute   with a value of “Visit page” and a rel attribute with a value of “section.” This is easily done by  using the attr   method, as in the following code:  $ "navbox a" .attr {   title: "Visit page",    rel: "section"  } ;  This will do as expected, and each one of the links will have both attributes set to the specified  values.  The only issue here is that each   element has the exact same title attribute. It would be   better if each title uniquely described each link. To fix this, you can define a function as the  value for title within the object literal. Since attr   will execute on all matched elements in the  selection, you can use a function in combination with $ this  to create a unique title for each of  the   elements, as shown in the following code  save as set-attrs.js :  $ "navbox a" .attr {   title: function   {     return "Visit our " + $ this .text   + "page.";   },    rel: "section"  } ;  The function returns a  value for each matched  element in the selection.  As you can see, the function returns a string value based on the text within the element.  The text   function in jQuery is used to get  or set  the text within an element without any   of the HTML code. In this case, no HTML is present within the    tags, but this just  ensures you do not get unwanted HTML code with the text should any ever get within the tags   if you do want the HTML code, you can use html   instead .  NOTE If the text   method is called on a selection that contains more than one matched  element, it will combine the text from all matched elements and return that value.  Open the set-attrs.html file in your browser and move your mouse over each link to reveal   the title. Each element now has its own title  “Visit our About page” for the first link, “Visit  our Services page” for the second link, and “Visit our Contact page” for the last link . Creating New Elements The jQuery library makes it easy to create and insert new elements into the document. Using a  combination of the $   function and several available methods, you can add elements anywhere  you need to in your documents.   128  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  In fact, one of the available methods is one you have used already: append  . As you will   recall, append   allows you to insert content at the end of each matched element in a selection,  as in the following code:  $ ".my-elements" .append " Thanks! " ;  This appends the paragraph with text to the end of each matched element. Each insertion is added  to the DOM tree, allowing you to access the added elements for further scripting. For example,  the   elements added in the code could now be accessed using $ “.my-elements p” .  In addition to this, you can use the appendTo   method, which allows you to insert  content within the $   function and append it to the end of each matched element of a  selection that is sent as an argument in the appendTo   method. The following code shows an  example of this:  $ " Thanks! " .appendTo ".my-elements" ;  As you can see, both append   and appendTo   perform the same task, but having both gives  you the flexibility to specify the selection and then the content or to specify the content and  then the selection. Insertion Methods There are several other methods for inserting content within, before, or after matched elements.  These are listed in Table 5-6.  All of these work the same way as append   appendTo  , but place the specified content in   different places. For example, before   insertBefore   will place the specified content outside the  matched elements right before each element’s opening tag, while prepend   prependTo   will  place the content within the matched elements immediately after each element’s opening tag.  Some examples of this will be shown based on the following HTML code snippet:    John is a writer.    Methods append   appendTo   prepend   prependTo   after   insertAfter   before   insertBefore    Description Inserts content within each matched element immediately before the element’s  closing tag Inserts content within each matched element immediately after the element’s  opening tag Inserts content immediately after the closing tag of each matched element   outside of the matched element  Inserts content immediately before the opening tag of each matched element   outside of the matched element   Table 5-6     Methods That Insert Content   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  129  Using $ “.bio” .before “ Some random text ” ; will result in the following HTML     Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.    after being executed:   Some random text    John is a writer.    Some random text    Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.       Some random text  John is a writer.      Some random text  Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.      John is a writer.    Some random text    Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.    Some random text   Using $ “.bio” .prepend “ Some random text ” ; will result in the following:  Using $ “.bio” .after “ Some random text ” ; will result in the following:  As you can see, you can make any selection you need and combine it with one of these   methods to place content into the document wherever you need it. Moving Elements Elements in the DOM tree can be moved using the same methods. You simply select the  elements to move and insert them into a specified new location. For example, suppose you had  the following HTML code  save as move-els.html :          130  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide         Move Elements          navbox { width:40%; border:solid 1px 000; }                                    Move Navigation Box                     About        Services        Contact            I like to talk about stuff. I think most stuff is cool, so it  probably is no surprise to you that I keep talking about stuff!          Here, you have a navigation box  navbox  and a paragraph  mystuff . There is also a  button  move-box  that will allow you to move the navigation box. Suppose you wanted to  move the navigation box below the paragraph. jQuery allows you to easily do this using the  following code  save as move-els.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "move-box" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "navbox" .insertAfter "mystuff" ;   } ; } ;  As you can see, navbox is selected, then inserted after mystuff using insertAfter  .  Figure 5-3 shows the initial page, and Figure 5-4 shows the page after the button has been  clicked. Inserting Wrapper Elements There may be times when you want to wrap an element around each matched element   multiple wrapper elements  or wrap all of the matched elements within a single wrapper  element. These adjustments can be made using wrap   and wrapAll  .   Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  131  Figure 5-3 The initial page  Figure 5-4 The page after the button is clicked  Suppose you had the following HTML code snippet:    John is a writer.     Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.    individually, as in the following code:  $ ".bio" .wrap "  " ;  This will result in the following HTML code:      John is a writer.      The first   element is  wrapped inside a   element  You can use wrap   to wrap an element around each one of the   elements    132  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide      Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.      The last   element also gets  wrapped inside a   element  In contrast to this, using wrapAll   will result in a single   element being wrapped   around the outside of both of the .bio   elements. For example, you could use the  following code:  $ ".bio" .wrap "  " ;  This will result in the following HTML code:      John is a writer.     Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.      Here, there is only a single   wrapped around the .bio   elements. Copying Elements The clone   method allows you to copy selected elements and then place the copy into the  document where you need it using one of the content insertion methods. For example, suppose  you had the following HTML code  save as clone.html :               Clone Elements          navbox { width:40%; border:solid 1px 000; }                                    Clone Navigation Box    Chapter 5:  JavaScript and the Document Object Model  133                     About        Services        Contact           I like to talk about stuff. I think most stuff is cool, so it  probably is no surprise to you that I keep talking about stuff!           You could use clone   to copy the nav-box element, then chain the appendTo   method to  insert the copied navigation box just before the closing   tag when the button is clicked,  as shown in this code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "clone-box" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "navbox" .clone  .appendTo "body" ;   } ; } ;  This will make a copy of the navigation box after the other content on the page. Figure 5-5  shows the initial page, and Figure 5-6 shows the page after the button is clicked.  Figure 5-5 The initial page   134  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 5-6 The page after the button is clicked, with the additional navigation box  Removing Elements When you need to remove elements, you can choose between empty  , remove  , and detach  .   ● The empty   method removes all elements and their children that are inside of the matched   elements  including text .   ● The remove   method removes the matched elements themselves in addition to all children   of the matched elements  including text .   ● The detach   method works just like remove  , except that it keeps a record of the detached   elements so that you can add them back to the DOM tree later if needed.  For example, suppose you had the following HTML code snippet:    John is a writer.     Marty is a black belt in Kung Foo.           Using $ ".bio" .empty  ; would result in the following HTML code when complete:  Using $ ".bio" .remove  ; or $ ".bio" .detach  ; would result in the   elements being  removed entirely from the document, but when using detach  , they can be restored using an  insertion method, as in the following code:  $ ".bio" .appendTo "body" ;  All of these can be helpful to remove elements from the document when needed.

These include showing, hiding, sliding, fading, and even creating your own custom animations.   Since jQuery deals with any cross-browser issues, you can simply call the jQuery methods you  need to use and the library will handle the animation work across the various browsers.  In this chapter, you will learn how to use the different animation methods available in the   jQuery library, how to create custom animations, and how to stop animations that are currently  running.  Show and Hide Animation Methods  The jQuery library provides a set of methods for common animations. These are listed in  Table 6-1.  The options range from simply showing and hiding elements to sliding and fading. To   begin, you will look at the show   and hide   methods.  Method show   hide   toggle   slideDown   slideUp   slideToggle   fadeIn   fadeOut   fadeToggle    Description Displays an element Hides an element Alternates between show   and hide   Displays an element by gradually moving it down into the display area Hides an element by gradually moving it up from the display area Alternates between slideDown   and slideUp   Displays an element by gradually increasing its opacity Hides an element by gradually decreasing its opacity Alternates between fadeIn   and fadeOut    Table 6-1 Common Animation Methods   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  141  The show   and hide   Methods The show   and hide   methods allow you to show and hide elements in the document:  show   will display hidden elements, and hide   will hide elements that are already  displayed. The showing and hiding is done through the CSS display property—hide   works  like display:none, while show   returns the display property to its original state  block, inline, and so on .  It is typically a good idea to display all content by default for accessibility  for those who  don’t have JavaScript to uncover a hidden element, for instance . With that in mind, you will  likely want to do any initial hiding via your jQuery JavaScript code. In jQuery, this can be  done using the hide   method.  As an example, suppose you had an element you wanted to be hidden initially, but it   could be uncovered by clicking a link. You might, for instance, have something similar to the  following HTML code snippet:  The link on this line should cause the    element below it to display      What is the answer?  Get Answer        The answer is 42!    This   element needs to be  hidden initially and displayed when  the link is clicked  You want to hide the answer   element until the link is clicked to uncover it. Since  you don’t want to hide it from those without JavaScript enabled, it is best not to hide it via  CSS  Cascading Style Sheets . Instead, you can use jQuery code to hide it as soon as the  document is ready to be manipulated, as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "answer" .hide  ; } ;  The hide   method is used to hide  the answer   element  This will simply hide the element immediately, which works well in this case  since you want  it to appear hidden without any delay .  As you can see, calling hide   without an argument will just hide any selected elements   instantly. If you want to hide an element with a gradual animation, you can supply an argument  to determine the speed at which the element will be hidden. Table 6-2 lists the valid types of  values for the speed argument.  The three string values are presets that will animate over 600, 400, or 200 milliseconds. In  addition, you can supply your own number of milliseconds to have the animation operate at a    142  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Example hide "slow"  hide "normal"  hide "fast"  hide number   Description Hides the element in 600 milliseconds Hides the element in 400 milliseconds Hides the element in 200 milliseconds Hides the element in the specified number of milliseconds  Table 6-2 Possible Speed Values  custom speed. For example, hide 2000  will hide the element in 2000 milliseconds   2 seconds .  The show   method will show a hidden element, restoring its original display property. In  the case of the example, the default display for a   element  block  would be used since it  was not specified in the CSS or changed before being hidden in the jQuery code.  For example, to display the hidden answer element when the link is clicked, you could use   the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "answer" .hide  ;   $ "ans-link" .click function event  {     $ "answer" .show  ;   } ; } ;  When the link is clicked, the answer element will be displayed immediately, and will move  any elements following it to fit back into its space in the document.  This will simply show the element once. If you want to alternate between show   and   hide   each time the button is clicked, you can use toggle   as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "answer" .hide  ;   $ "ans-link" .click function event  {     $ "answer" .toggle  ;   } ; } ;  The answer will now be shown on the first click, hidden on the second click, and so on.  The show   and toggle   methods can take the same speed argument that hide   does, so   they, too, can be animated if desired. When using the speed argument to animate a show hide,  the element’s height, width, and opacity will all be changed during the animation [show   causes the element to become larger and more visible, while hide   causes the element to  become smaller and less visible]. If this is not the desired animation effect, you can use one  of the other predefined methods or create your own custom animation  all of which will be  discussed as you proceed through this chapter .   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  143  Building a FAQ Page For the examples in this chapter, it will be helpful to have a document that you can build on  in order to see the different effects in action. To begin, use the following HTML code  save as  animate.html :               Animations          header { float:left; background-color:000; color:FFF; width:90%;              padding:1% 5%; text-align:center; }     main { clear:both; float:left; width:76%; font-family:Arial;  margin:2%; }     sidebar { float:left; width:16%; margin:2% 0%; text-align:center; }     footer { clear:both; float:left; background-color:000; color:FFF;              width:90%; padding:1% 5%; text-align:center; }     .question { font-weight:bold; font-size:1.3em; width:80%; margin- top:1em; }     .answer { font-style:italic; width:80%; }                       Frequently Asked Questions              What does this site do?

This creates a very basic page with a header, main content, sidebar, and footer. Figure 6-1  shows the page before any scripting is done. Notice that all of the elements are currently  displayed.  Within the page, you will be reacting to clicks on the various buttons to show or hide   elements as needed. The first thing you will want to do is hide all of the elements that have  the answer class. This is done easily by using the class as the selector and calling the hide   method, as in the following code  save as animate.js :  Next, you will want to hide the book-info element. This is another easy task to perform by   selecting its id and using hide  . This is added in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".answer" .hide  ; } ;  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ; } ;   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  145  Figure 6-1 The static animate.html page  At this point, everything you need to hide has been hidden. When you load the animate  .html page in a browser now, it should display as shown in Figure 6-2.  In this section, you will write the code to toggle the first answer in the list between show   and hide  the others will be dealt with as you proceed through the sections that follow . To  select the first answer, you can use :eq   to get the element when selecting the answers class.  This can be done as in Chapter 2, shown in the following code:  $ ".answer:eq 0 "   Recall that :eq   uses a zero-based index, so the first item will be at index 0, the second item at  index 1, and so on.  Alternatively, jQuery provides a separate eq   method. This allows you to make a selection   first, then apply the eq   method to it in order to get any element using a zero-based index.  Using this, you can make the selection of the first answer   element with the following  code:  $ ".answer" .eq 0   In either case, you can chain further jQuery methods to the selection, such as the one  you need here, which is toggle  . To complete the code, you will need to select the show  hide button for the first answer  id ans-00 , register the click event, and add the toggle to the    146  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 6-2 The animate.html page with the answers and book information hidden    element containing the first answer. For practice, you will use 1000 as the argument  to toggle  , which will animate the showing and hiding of the element over one second. The  following code adds this functionality:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;   } ; } ;  Prevents the default action  Selects the first element from the selection  which got all of the elements with the answer class  and toggles between showing and hiding the element over one second each time  that the button is clicked  Refresh the answers.html page in your browser and click the button. Figure 6-3 shows the   result once the button is clicked and the show animation completes.  There is one final issue to deal with here. You will notice that the button is labeled “Show   Answer” when the toggle is showing the element and when the element is being hidden. It  would be better for the user to see which type of action will take place when the button is  clicked each time.  The good news is that you can fix this by simply alternating the text of the button using   the text   method you learned in the last chapter. Since it is set to “Show Answer” in the    Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  147  Figure 6-3 The first answer is displayed after the button is clicked.  HTML code, you can use that value to alternate the text between “Show Answer” and “Hide  Answer” each time the button is clicked with an if else statement. This is shown in the  following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;     if  $ "ans-00" .text   === "Show Answer"  {       $ "ans-00" .text "Hide Answer" ;     }     else {        $ "ans-00" .text "Show Answer" ;     }   } ; } ;  Begins an if statement that checks the  value of the text in the   element  If the text is equal to “Show Answer,” this statement is  executed, which changes the text to “Hide Answer”  If the text is not equal to “Show Answer,”  this statement is executed, which  changes the text to “Show Answer”   148  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Reload the animate.html page in your browser and click the button. Each time the   button is clicked, its label will change to reflect what will happen the next time it is  clicked. Figure 6-4 shows the page when the answer is hidden  “Show Answer” label for  the button , and Figure 6-5 shows the page when the answer is displayed  “Hide Answer”  label for the button .  You now have the setup complete for the first answer. To tackle the display of the second   answer, you will use the methods jQuery provides for sliding elements.  The slideDown   and slideUp   Methods In contrast to show   and hide  , the slideDown   and slideUp   methods show and hide  elements by animating only the height. This makes the elements appear to “slide” in  and out of the page. If you want to toggle between the two, the slideToggle   method is  provided to do so.  To make use of this, you will use slideToggle   to alternate between slideDown   and   slideUp   each time the button for the second answer is clicked. This will be nearly identical to  the code to handle the previous answer  , but will register the event to the second button and  display hide the second answer   using slideToggle  . This is shown in the following code:  $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle "slow" ; } ;  Notice the id for the second    element is used to register a new click event  The second element in the selection of elements with the  answer class is selected and the slideToggle   method is  applied using “slow” as the argument  Figure 6-4 The page when the answer is hidden   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  149  Figure 6-5 The page when the answer is shown  Notice here that the second   element  id ans-01  gets a click event registered to  it. The second answer element is selected by providing 1 as the index in eq  . Finally,  slideToggle   is applied with the “slow” argument, which will animate the slide animation  over 600 milliseconds  a little faster than your previous element’s animation, which was set to  1000 milliseconds .  This can now be added to the code in place to animate both of the answer   elements   when the corresponding buttons are clicked. This is shown in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;     if  $ "ans-00" .text   === "Show Answer"  {       $ "ans-00" .text "Hide Answer" ;     }     else {        $ "ans-00" .text "Show Answer" ;     }   } ;  The first click event for the  first button is handled   150  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide    $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle "slow" ;   } ; } ;  The click event for the second  button is handled—but it isn’t  alternating the button text yet!  This will slide the text in and out when the second button is clicked, but that pesky   button text is at it again! One solution would be to rewrite the if else statement here, as in the  following code:  $ "ans-01" .click function event  {    event.preventDefault  ;   $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle "slow" ;   if  $ "ans-01" .text   === "Show Answer"  {     $ "ans-01" .text "Hide Answer" ;   }   else {      $ "ans-01" .text "Show Answer" ;   } } ;  The if else statement is  added to change the  button label text  Notice that this is the same if else statement you used for the previous button  ans-00 ,   with the only change being the selection of ans-01 instead of ans-00. It would be nice  if you did not need to duplicate this code each time you want to change button label text.  Instead, you could write this if else statement into a separate JavaScript function and send it  the selected element as an argument. The following code shows how this could be written as  a function:  The function is declared with a single  argument, a jQuery object  an element  selection in this case   function labelChange $jqObject  {   if  $jqObject.text   === "Show Answer"  {     $jqObject.text "Hide Answer" ;   }   else {      $jqObject.text "Show Answer" ;   } }  Since the $jqObject argument is already a  jQuery object, the $   function is not required  to reselect the necessary element s ; all jQuery  methods are available to it, and text   is used here   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  151  The function performs the same task, but is sent an argument to determine which     element is to be changed when it is called. If you go back to the click   event handler for the  ans-00 element, you could use the following code to call the function:  $ "ans-00" .click function event  {    event.preventDefault  ;   $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;   labelChange $ this  ; } ;  The labelChange   function is called using $ this , which refers to the ans-00 button here  since it  is the object that invoked the click   method   Here, the value of $ this  is sent as the argument to the labelChange   function. You could  send it $ ans-00  specifically if preferred, but using $ this  allows the function call to remain  more consistent when used in other event handlers  you won’t have to use ans-00, ans-01, and so on for the argument each time .  To put this all together, edit your animate.js file so that you have the following code  adds   the function and both function calls :  The function is added  $ document .ready function   {   function labelChange $jqObject  {       if  $jqObject.text   === "Show Answer"  {       $jqObject.text "Hide Answer" ;     }     else {       $jqObject.text "Show Answer" ;     }   }   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;     labelChange $ this  ;   } ;   $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle "slow" ;     labelChange $ this  ;   } ; } ;  The function is called in both cases using $ this  as the argument, which will be ans-00 for the  first button and ans-01 for the second button   152  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Reload the animate.html file in your browser. Both buttons should now have the label text   change when clicked. The use of the function saves some duplicate coding, and each animation  still works as expected. Figure 6-6 shows the page after the second button is clicked and the  label text is changed. The fadeIn   and fadeOut   Methods The fadeIn   and fadeOut   methods alter the opacity of the element, increasing it  for fadeIn   and decreasing it for fadeOut  . To toggle between them, you can use  toggleFade  .  The last element to animate in your animate.html file is in the sidebar. In this case, you   will use toggleFade   to fade the element in or out when the “Show Book Info!” button is  clicked.  The only difference here is that this element is not part of the answers class, but has its   own id  book-info . The button element has an id of book-show. The following code can be  used to toggle the fade effect when the button is clicked:  $ "book-show" .click function event  {   event.preventDefault  ;    $ "book-info" .fadeToggle "slow" ; } ;  Figure 6-6 The label text for the button now changes as expected when the second button is  clicked.   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  153  While this is easily added, it is not altering the label text for the   element yet. Not  only that, but you can’t simply plug in the handy function you already created as it is, because  rather than “Show Answer” and “Hide Answer,” you now want to use “Show Book Info!” and  “Hide Book Info!” for the label text.  Looking at the label text more closely, however, shows that there is one thing in common:   Both types of label text start with either “Show” or “Hide.” If the remainder of the text can  be sent as a second argument, then you just need a way to figure out whether the first word is  “Show” or “Hide” and adjust that as needed. The indexOf   Method in JavaScript JavaScript offers a handy method for finding the starting position of any set of characters  within a string: indexOf  . This method takes a string as an argument and searches for it within  another string. If it is found, then the starting position of the string  zero-based  is returned.  Otherwise, the value of -1 is returned.  An example of this is shown in the following code:  var myText = "Is Bob here?"; var whereIsBob = myText.indexOf "Bob" ;     whereIsBob = 3 var isThereAnI = myText.indexOf "I" ;     isThereAnI = 0 var whereisJoe = myText.indexOf "Joe" ;     whereIsJoe = -1  A string value is assigned to the variable myText  The string “Joe” is not found, so -1 is returned  The string “I” is found at position 0  The string “Bob” is located at position 3  counting begins at zero   Notice that you append the indexOf   method to a string by adding a dot and then the method,  just as you would use a jQuery method. It returns the position at which the string argument is  found, beginning with zero. Altering the labelChange   Function Using indexOf  , you can now alter the labelChange   function to work for all three buttons on  the page. You will need to add a second argument, which will be the text for the label that will  follow “Show” or “Hide” in each case.  The following code shows the altered labelChange   function:  A new argument is added, labelText  function labelChange $jqObject, labelText  {   if  $jqObject.text  .indexOf "Show"  === 0  {  The indexOf   method determines  if the string “Show” is at the  beginning of the label text for the  current   element   154  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide      $jqObject.text "Hide " + labelText ;   }   else {     $jqObject.text "Show " + labelText ;     }   }  If “Show” is not at the beginning of  the label text, the label text is changed  to “Show” plus the value sent as the  second argument  If “Show” is at the beginning of the  label text, the label text is changed  to “Hide” plus the value sent as the  second argument  which could be  “Answer” or “Book Info!” in this case   Notice that the function now looks for “Show” at the beginning of the label text   for the   element that is sent to the function. It will then append the value of the  second argument after the word “Hide” or “Show,” depending on the result. So, if the  function were called from the event handler for ans-00, using $ this  and “Answer” as the arguments, the result of the first click would be to change the label text to “Hide  Answer”. Calling the function from the book-show event handler using $ this  and  “Book Info!” as arguments would result in the first click changing the button text to “Hide  Book Info!”.  You can now alter your animate.js file to alter the function and update the function calls.   Edit the file to use the following code and save it:  The labelChange   function now using  indexOf    $ document .ready function   {   function labelChange $jqObject, labelText  {     if  $jqObject.text  .indexOf "Show"  === 0  {       $jqObject.text "Hide " + labelText ;     }     else {       $jqObject.text "Show " + labelText ;     }   }   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;     labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle 'slow' ;     labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;  Hiding elements  Handles a click on the  first button  Handles a click on the  second button   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  155    $ "book-show" .click function event  {        event.preventDefault  ;         $ "book-info" .fadeToggle "slow" ;        labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ;   } ; } ;  Handles a click on the  third button  Notice that the first argument each time the function is called is $ this , since $ this  will be the   element that is being handled at the time in each case. The  second argument is “Answer” for the first two buttons, but is “Book Info!” for the  third, allowing the single function to update the button labels for all of the buttons on  the page.  Reload the animate.html file in your Web browser. Clicking the buttons will now   show and hide each piece of content with the specified animation and will alter the button  text to assist the user. Figure 6-7 shows the page after the “Show Book Info!” button is  clicked once, which fades in the additional information and changes the button label text  to “Hide Book Info!”.  Figure 6-7 The page after the first click of the “Show Book Info!” button   156  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Ask the Expert Q: Those are some nice animations, but I would like to customize them more. Is there a   way to place several animations in sequence or to create a custom animation?  A: Yes, both can be done! As you progress through this chapter, you will learn to use callback  functions, which will allow you to call a function once the current animation is complete,  giving you the option to string several animations together. You will also learn the animate   method, which gives you the opportunity to determine which CSS properties are animated  and create a custom animation.  Q: Why use a JavaScript function when I could just replicate the if else statement? A: Referring to the example, you can use either method. Keep in mind, however, that once   more buttons are added, you will need to continue replicating the if else statement for every  single button. The function gives you the freedom to simply call it rather than duplicating  the entire statement and changing the button id each time.  Q: Do I really need another JavaScript method like indexOf  ? A: Often, this won’t be necessary; but it is handy in some situations, such as the one in the  example. There will be times where using a JavaScript property or method will be a great  complement to what jQuery already does.  Callback Functions  Each of the animation methods also allows you to include another argument, which is a  callback function. The callback function executes as soon as the animation method is finished. For example, if you run the fadeIn   method and wish to run a function when it completes,   you could use code like the following:  $ "my-element" .fadeIn "slow", function   {   $ "my-element" .fadeOut "slow" ; } ;  This would simply fade out the element immediately after it had faded in, which often   would not be particularly useful. In fact, if you are going to call additional animations on the  same element, you can simply chain them together, as in the following code:  $ "my-element" .fadeIn "slow" .fadeOut "slow" ;  In such a case, the chain would be quicker and easier to write. However, you can also use   the callback function to animate other elements, which will give it further use.   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  157  Going back to your animate.html file, suppose you wanted to add another   element below  the book-info  , have it hidden, and have it slide down only after the “Show Book Info!” button  is clicked and the animation for the book-info   is complete. This will create what appears to be  an extended animation sequence, and can be done using the callback function to do the work.  First, open your animate.html file and update it to use the following code for the     element and save it:                     Show Book Info!                    Yes, I wrote a book called  How to Write FAQs: The Rules<  cite>!     Buy it today!           Special! Buy the book now and save 50%! This is a limited time offer  so don't delay! Buy it today!        This   element is  added and will be shown  using a callback method  Next, alter the animate.js file to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   function labelChange $jqObject, labelText  {     if  $jqObject.text  .indexOf "Show"  === 0  {       $jqObject.text "Hide " + labelText ;     }     else {       $jqObject.text "Show " + labelText ;     }   }   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "more-book-info" .css {"color": "FFF", "background-color":  "333"} .hide  ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;     labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;  Giving the more-book-info element  some additional CSS to highlight it  and hiding it by chaining the css   and hide   methods   158  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide      $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle 'slow' ;     labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "book-show" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;      $ "book-info" .fadeToggle "slow", function   {       $ "more-book-info" .slideToggle "slow" ;     } ;   labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ;   } ; } ;  Adds the callback  function to slide  the more-book- info element down  or up once the  fade animation is  complete  As you can see, the new element is first hidden along with the others. Within the fadeToggle   method for the book-info element, a callback function is added as an argument, which then  uses slideToggle   on the more-book-info element once the fade is complete on the book-info element.  Reload the animate.html file in your browser and click the “Show Book Info!” button. The   first element will fade in, and the second element will slide down. Figure 6-8 shows the page  once both animations have completed.  When you click a second time to hide the elements, you will notice that the fade occurs   first, then the slide. While this order is great for showing the elements, it provides a bit of a jolt   Figure 6-8 The page after the “Show Book Info!” button is clicked and the animations are  complete   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  159  when hiding the elements since the fade out will “jump” the second   up the screen once  the first one has faded out. It will then perform the slide up.  Instead of the current toggle, you may wish to perform the hiding of the elements in the   reverse order of their showing. A slide up followed by a fade out would look like a much  smoother transition. To do this, recall that when you hide an element, the CSS display property  is changed to the value of none. This could be used with an if else statement to allow you to  perform the animations one way when showing and the other way when hiding. Consider the  following code:  if  $ "book-info" .css "display"  === "none"  {       Fade in book-info and then slide down more-book-info } else {      Slide up more-book-info and then fade out  book-info }  Here, the if statement uses the css method to determine the value of the display property  for the book-info element  since these are being shown and hidden together, testing one of  them should be sufficient in this case, but be careful to adjust as needed if different tasks are  performed . If display is none, then the elements will be shown by fading in the first   and  sliding down the second. If they are currently visible, then the order will be reversed to hide  them.  To complete this, you will need to fill in the additional code. Since toggling does not   produce the desired effect here, you will need to specifically use fadeIn  , slideDown  , slideUp  , and fadeOut  . This would produce the following code for the click   method for the  “Show Book Info!” button:  $ "book-show" .click function event  {   event.preventDefault  ;   if  $ "book-info" .css "display"  === "none"  {      $ "book-info" .fadeIn "slow", function   {       $ "more-book-info" .slideDown 1500 ;     } ;   }   else {     $ "more-book-info" .slideUp 1500, function   {       $ "book-info" .fadeOut "slow" ;     } ;   }   labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ; } ;  If the book-info element is currently  hidden, then it is  displayed using  fadeIn  , which uses  a callback function to  slide down the more- book-info element  when complete  If book-info is already displayed, then the  more-book-info element is hidden first using  slideUp  , which uses a callback function to fade  out the book-info element when complete   160  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  This works, but the repeated use of the same two selections of $ “book-info”  and $ “more- book-info”  require that the elements be located in the DOM  Document Object Model  for  each use  which, over time and with enough calls, will cause the script to run more slowly  than it otherwise could . To keep this from being necessary, you can cache the selections in a  JavaScript variable. Consider the following code:  var $bookInfo = $ "book-info" ,      $moreBookInfo = $ "more-book-info" ;  This places both selections into JavaScript variables. When this is done, the script will already  know what element s  to alter when it sees the variable, rather than needing to search the DOM  for the element s  again.  Since the variables represent jQuery objects  selections in this case , the variables   use a $ symbol as the first character. This is not required, but can be a helpful  convention to use in your code so that you can quickly recognize that the variable  represents a jQuery object rather than a simple string or one of the other possible data  types in JavaScript.  In this case, the variables can be defined at the beginning of the function that handles the  click   method for the button, and can be used anywhere within that function. Thus, you could  update the function to use the following code:  The selections that will be  reused are assigned to  variables  $ "book-show" .click function event  {   var $bookInfo = $ "book-info" ,        $moreBookInfo = $ "more-book-info" ;    event.preventDefault  ;   if  $bookInfo.css "display"  === "none"  {      $bookInfo.fadeIn "slow", function   {       $moreBookInfo.slideDown 1500 ;     } ;   }   else {     $moreBookInfo.slideUp 1500, function   {       $bookInfo.fadeOut "slow" ;     } ;   }   labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ; } ;  The variables are used in place of the selection  syntax to perform the necessary operations   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  161  With the variables in place, you can now use them in place of the usual selection syntax. The  selections are now cached and used as needed, and the animations still run in the desired order.  Try This 6-1  Practice with slideDown    pr06-01.html pr06-01.js  This project allows you to practice using the jQuery slideDown   method to  show a hidden   element on the page.  Step by Step  1.

Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of one of the preset slideDown   animation methods  to show an element using a “slide down” animation when a link was clicked.  Creating Custom Animations  The jQuery library provides the animate   method, which allows you to customize what CSS  properties are animated, specify the speed, specify the easing, and provide a callback function  when it is run. This gives you the ability to create a custom animation to fit your needs.  The animate   method has the following basic syntax:  $ "my-element" .animate { property: value, property: value },                           duration, easing, callback ;  The last three arguments are optional and will simply use default values if one or more of them  is not specified.  The arguments and their possible values are listed in Table 6-3.  Argument { property: value, property: value }  duration  easing  callback  Description Lists CSS properties that are to be animated and  the value of each property at the completion of the  animation The time it will take to complete the animation  in  milliseconds  or one of the preset values slow, normal, or fast The type of easing to use for the animation: either  swing or linear The callback function to execute when the animation  completes  Table 6-3 Arguments for the animate   Method   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  163  Property Value Map The first argument is a property value map, which is simply a list of properties and values in  object literal notation. The properties are the CSS properties to be animated, and the values are  the target values for each property when the animation is complete.  You can animate one property or as many as you need using this method. The limitation  is that only properties with numeric values can be animated, such as width, height, top, left,  font-size, margin, padding, border, and so on. The values can be a target number or a relative  target number using += or -= followed by the value. They can also be one of the preset  values of show, hide, and toggle. Some examples of this are shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"} ;        increases or decreases the height to 20px $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"+=20px"} ;        increases the current height by 20px $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"toggle"} ;        increases the height from 0 to its original value, or decreases  it to zero  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"+=20px", "font-size": "-=0.3em"} ;        increases the height by 20px and decreased the font by 0.3em  As you can see, you can come up with any number of combinations within the map. This can  be used to customize the properties and values that are animated according to your specific  needs. Duration Values Just like the other animation methods, the animate   method itself can use the preset values of  slow, normal, and fast, as well as define a specific number of milliseconds that the animation  should last.  Some examples of providing the duration argument are shown here:  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"}, 1000 ;        Animates for 1000 milliseconds  one second  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"}, "fast" ;        Animates "fast"  200 milliseconds   As with the other animation methods, specifying this argument is fairly straightforward. Easing Values There are only two values for the easing argument: swing and linear. The swing value is used  by default if the argument is not specified. Other values are possible, however, using jQuery  plugins, which will be discussed in Chapter 10.   164  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The easing defines the speed of the animation at different points in the animation sequence.  For example, the linear setting keeps the speed constant throughout the animation, while swing will start, speed up a bit, and then slow down a bit as the animation progresses.  Some examples are shown in the following code:  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"}, 1000, "swing" ;        Animates using swing easing $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"}, 1000, "linear" ;        Animates using linear easing  Callback Function As with the other animation methods, you can provide a callback function to be executed when  the animation completes. An example of this is shown next:  $ "my-element" .animate {"height":"20px"}, 1000, "swing", function    {      Code to run when animation completes } ;  The Second Form of animate   In addition to the standard form with four arguments, you can call animate   using a second  form, which uses the first argument  the property value map , then moves the other arguments  to a map to provide the second argument. The map for the second argument adds the ability  to provide special easing for specific properties, specify whether the animation should run in  queue or at the same time as the previous animation, and provide a step function that is called  for each animated property and element.  The following code shows the general syntax for this form of the animate   method:  $ "my-element" .animate {     property: value,      property: value    }, {     duration: value,      easing: value,     specialEasing: {       property: value,       property: value     },     complete: function   {          Code to run when animation completes     },    Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  165      queue: value,      step: function   {          Code to run for each animated property and element     } } ;  The key new elements here are the specialEasing map within the second map, the queue property, and the step function. Special Easing The specialEasing map allows you to define the easing for each animated property  individually, rather than having all of the properties use the same easing. So, if you want to  animate both the height and border width of an element but use swing for the height and linear for the border width, you could write the specialEasing map as in the following code:  specialEasing: {       "height": "swing",       "border-width": "linear"     },  Queue The queue property can be set to true or false. If set to true, the animation will run in its  normal position in the queue  after all previous animations . If set to false, then the animation  will run at the same time as the animation prior to it in the normal queue, and the normal queue  will then resume again afterward.  Step Function The last new option is a step function, which allows you to execute code at each step of the  animation for each animated element. This can be useful if you wish to alter the animation at  each step or need to make additional customizations.  Updating the FAQ Page Now that you have seen how the animate   method works, you can use it to update your  animate.html and animate.js files. Suppose you want to provide a custom animation when  the page loads that will hide the   element, add a border around it, and then show it by  animating both the border width and height of the element.  This can all be done in your jQuery code, so no updates are needed to the HTML file. The   first part of this is straightforward. The element can be hidden by simply calling the hide   method, as in the following code:  $ "header h1" .hide  ;   166  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Next, you can chain together the css   method  to add the border  and the animate    method to create the animation:  $ "header h1" .css { "border-style": "solid",                       "border-color": "FFF",                       "border-width": "10px" }         .animate { "border-width": "show", "height": "show" }, 5000 ;  Here, the CSS is altered to add a 10px border around the   element while it is hidden.  The animate   method then uses show as the value for the border-width and height properties,  which allows the element to show the animation.  CAUTION Unless an element is already visible, the animate   method will run while the element is  hidden and be invisible to the user unless either show   is called on the element before  animate   or the properties are animated using the value show, as in this example.  You can now add this to your JavaScript file. Update animate.js to use the following code   and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   function labelChange $jqObject, labelText  {     if  $jqObject.text  .indexOf "Show"  === 0  {       $jqObject.text "Hide " + labelText ;     }     else {       $jqObject.text "Show " + labelText ;     }   }   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "more-book-info" .css {"color": "FFF", "background-color":  "333"} .hide  ;   $ "header h1" .hide  ;   $ "header h1" .css { "border-style": "solid",                        "border-color": "FFF",                         "border-width": "10px" }              .animate { "border-width": "show", "height": "show" }, 5000 ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;       labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle 'slow' ;  The new code is  inserted here   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  167      labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "book-show" .click function event  {        var $bookInfo = $ "book-info" ,             $moreBookInfo = $ "more-book-info" ;         event.preventDefault  ;        if  $bookInfo.css "display"  === "none"  {           $bookInfo.fadeIn "slow", function   {            $moreBookInfo.slideDown 1500 ;          } ;        }        else {          $moreBookInfo.slideUp 1500, function   {            $bookInfo.fadeOut "slow" ;          } ;        }        labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ;   } ; } ;  Reload the animate.js file in your Web browser.

Open the pr06-02.html file in your Web browser. Click the link and the   will slide   down, and then the font size will grow very large!  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of animate   to create a custom animation that was  placed in the queue after a preset animation was complete. This added another effect to the  animated element.  Stopping Animations  There are times where stopping an animation can be helpful, such as when many animations  could end up in the queue, all happening one after another while the user is trying to do other  things.  This is most common with mouse hover effects, where an animation often lasts longer  than the amount of time the mouse is over the element. Often, the user will have moved the  mouse over another element, and if it has an animation, this is also placed in the queue but not  run until the first one completes. With enough of these in place, the page could become quite  jumpy for the user.  To avoid this type of behavior, jQuery provides the stop   method, which stops an   animation in its tracks. When used without any arguments, it will stop the animation “in-place”  immediately. For example, an element being shown will still show the portion of the element  that made it into view before stop   was called.  To provide additional stopping options, jQuery gives you two arguments you can send to   the stop   method: The first one specifies whether to clear the animation queue for the selected  element s , and the second specifies whether or not to jump to the end of the animation before  stopping it [which will completely show an element animated using show   or completely hide  an element animated using hide  ].  The following code shows some examples of the stop   method at work:  $ "my-element" .stop  ;      Stops the current animation in place, any queued animations for  the element       will now run. $ "my-element" .stop true, false ;      Stops the current animation in place, any queued animations for  the element       will not be run.  $ "my-element" .stop false, true ;      Stops the current animation by jumping to the end values, any queued       animations for the element will now run. $ "my-element" .stop true, true ;      Stops the current animation by jumping to the end values, any queued      animations for the element will not be run.   170  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  As you can see, the optional arguments provide you with the ability to customize the way in  which the animation is stopped.  A common use for this is to stop any animations occurring on mouseenter mouseleave on   an element before queuing another animation on it. For example, if you were animating the  height of an element when the mouse moves over it, then back when the mouse moves away,  you might use the hover   method to provide a custom animation for these events, as in the  following code:  $ "footer" .hover function   {     $ this .animate {"height": "+=20px"}, 1000 ;   }, function   {     $ this .animate {"height": "-=20px"}, 1000 ; } ;  This looks perfectly normal on the surface. If the user moves the mouse over the footer  element, it will expand by 20px in height, then returns when the mouse moves away. However,  an unexpected result occurs when the mouse moves back over the element before the  animation completes.  To see what happens, update the code to your animate.js file as shown here and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   function labelChange $jqObject, labelText  {     if  $jqObject.text  .indexOf "Show"  === 0  {       $jqObject.text "Hide " + labelText ;     }     else {       $jqObject.text "Show " + labelText ;     }   }   $ ".answer" .hide  ;   $ "book-info" .hide  ;   $ "more-book-info" .css {"color": "FFF", "background-color":  "333"} .hide  ;   $ "header h1" .hide  ;   $ "header h1" .css { "border-style": "solid",                        "border-color": "FFF",                         "border-width": "10px" }              .animate { "border-width": "show", "height": "show" }, 5000 ;   $ "ans-00" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 0 .toggle 1000 ;       labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "ans-01" .click function event  {      event.preventDefault  ;     $ ".answer" .eq 1 .slideToggle 'slow' ;   Chapter 6: Animations and Effects  171      labelChange $ this , "Answer" ;   } ;   $ "book-show" .click function event  {        var $bookInfo = $ "book-info" ,             $moreBookInfo = $ "more-book-info" ;         event.preventDefault  ;        if  $bookInfo.css "display"  === "none"  {           $bookInfo.fadeIn "slow", function   {            $moreBookInfo.slideDown 1500 ;          } ;        }        else {          $moreBookInfo.slideUp 1500, function   {            $bookInfo.fadeOut "slow" ;          } ;        }        labelChange $ this , "Book Info!" ;   } ;   $ "footer" .hover function   {     $ this .animate {"height": "+=20px"}, 1000 ;   }, function   {     $ this .animate {"height": "-=20px"}, 1000 ;   } ; } ;  The code is inserted here  Reload the animate.html file in your browser and move your mouse in and out of the footer  element several times. The animation gets queued again each time you do this, causing it to run  the animation for each of the mouse hovers in sequence before stopping, which is likely to be a  good while after you have stopped!  To keep this from happening, you can cause the animation to stop, be removed from  the queue, and then start again when the mouse moves in or out of the affected area. To  do this, simply alter the hover   method in animate.js as shown here and save the file  again:  $ "footer" .hover function   {   $ this .stop true, true .animate {"height": "+=20px"}, 1000 ; }, function   {   $ this .stop true, true .animate {"height": "-=20px"}, 1000 ; } ;  Reload the animate.html file in your browser and move the mouse in and out of the footer  element several times again. It may be a little jumpy if you do so rapidly, but once you have  left the element for good, the animation will simply complete and stop, rather than running  over and over again until it reaches the number of times it would have otherwise been  queued.   172  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  ✓  Chapter 6 Self Test  1.

One of the pieces of this topic that   was touched on was the Event object, which has properties and methods that can be used for  any event that occurs.  You have been passing the Event object as an argument to many of your event handlers   using event  lowercase  as a convenient name. Technically, you could use any name you like,  such as ev, evt, myEvent, and so on, but you will typically see either event or e used in jQuery  scripts. In this book, I use event, since it makes it as clear as possible what type of object is  being passed around.  This chapter will cover the jQuery Event object in more detail by looking at how it works   in jQuery, its properties, and its methods.  The Event Object in jQuery  The jQuery Event object is designed to work like the JavaScript Event object, but helps you to  avoid many of the issues of using it cross-browser by working behind the scenes to ensure that  the Event object is available and that properties and methods work in a consistent fashion. Browser Inconsistencies If you have worked with the Event object in JavaScript, you will likely have run across browser  differences. When registering events using the DOM 0 method  which is often done as a  fallback when addEventListener   is not available , Internet Explorer versions prior to version  9 required you to use window.event to access the Event object, while others used event. This  caused the need to write an additional statement in the code to handle this so that the Event object could be used, as shown in the following code:  document.getElementById "my-Element" .onclick = function event  {   var e = event  window.event;   alert e.type ;  This causes the variable e to hold the  Event object whether the browser uses  event or window.event to access it  }   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  177  As mentioned, the latest versions of the major browsers all have the addEventListener    method available and allow you to access the Event object using event. However, if you need  the script to work in older browsers, your JavaScript will need to adjust for the additional  possibilities for obtaining the Event object and for handling events.  With jQuery, you can simply use the Event object while this other work is done by the  library in the background. The event-handling methods and the Event object are designed  to work cross-browser so that you do not need to worry about creating your own custom  functions to handle all of the browser differences. About the Event Object The Event object itself is actually a straightforward JavaScript object containing properties  and methods that are helpful to you when certain events are triggered. The properties contain  information about the event, such as the type of event that was triggered, the target of the  event, and other information, while the methods allow you to perform actions such as stopping  the bubbling process or preventing the default event action.  One useful tool jQuery offers in versions 1.6 and higher is the ability to use the Event  constructor to trigger an event that contains customized information in the Event object. For  example, consider the following code:  var customEvent = jQuery.Event "keydown", { keyCode: 80 } ; $ "my-element" .trigger customEvent ;  Here, a keydown event is triggered, which uses 80 as the keycode. This allows it to simulate the  user pressing the p key while within my-element.  As you move through the chapter, you will learn the various properties and methods   of the Event object, which will make it a useful tool when you need to perform additional  customizations for events that occur on the page.  Ask the Expert Q: If it is just one difference with event vs. window.event, why not just use the JavaScript   Event object?  A: When coupled with the need to edit JavaScript code to handle events for older browsers,   this becomes more significant, and jQuery can save you a lot of time creating any necessary  code adjustments. However, there is certainly nothing wrong with using the JavaScript  event system if you prefer it or don’t need the jQuery library for other things  such as  element selection . For example, a short script that handles a small number of events could  be coded in JavaScript to avoid the need to load the jQuery library into the document.   continued    178  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Q: I’d like to use JavaScript for events instead. Any helpful tips? A: In addition to getting the Event object itself, you will need to be able to select elements   using JavaScript and to use it to handle events for each of the different browsers. A helpful  function for event handling can be found at http:  dean.edwards.name weblog 2005 10  add-event2 .  Q: So, does jQuery make all of the properties and methods of the Event object work   consistently?  A: The jQuery library has a number of properties and methods that it normalizes to work   consistently cross-browser, while others are made available as-is. This is discussed in more  detail in the sections that follow.  Event Properties  The Event object has numerous properties that store information about the event. The jQuery  library supports a number of these that work well cross-browser naturally or through the help  of jQuery.  Table 7-1 lists the properties of the Event object that are available cross-browser in jQuery    some are specific to jQuery itself .  Property currentTarget data delegateTarget metaKey  namespace pageX pageY relatedTarget result target timeStamp type which  Description The element that is currently handling the event An object of data that can be passed to an event handler The element to which the event was delegated Whether or not the meta key was pressed at the time of the event  this key may be  different on different platforms and keyboards  The namespace that was used for the event The position of the mouse from the left of the page The position of the mouse from the top of the page The related DOM element involved in the event The last value returned by the event handler, unless the value is undefined The element that is the target of  initiated  the event The time difference between January 1, 1970, and the time the event occurred The event type  for example, click, mouseover, and so on  The key code for a pressed key or the code for which mouse button was clicked  Table 7-1    jQuery Event Properties   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  179  You will learn about how to use selected properties from this list as you move through this   section of the chapter. You can go to http:  api.jquery.com category events event-object  to  learn more about any of these properties if needed.  Other event properties are available in JavaScript, though they are not necessarily   supported in jQuery. They also tend not to work cross-browser, though some can work in  tandem with others as a workaround. These additional properties are listed in Table 7-2.  Description Whether or not the ALT key was pressed when the event occurred Whether or not the event bubbles The mouse button that created the event  Whether or not the default action of the event can be canceled Cancels event bubbling when set to false The Unicode value of a pressed key The left position of the mouse in the client area  not the page  The top position of the mouse in the client area  not the page  Whether or not the CTRL key was pressed when the event occurred  Property altKey bubbles button cancelable cancelBubble charCode clientX clientY ctrlKey defaultPrevented Whether or not preventDefault   has been called detail eventPhase  Additional information about the event The phase in which the event handler was called: 1 = capturing, 2 = at target, 3 =  bubbling The key code of a pressed key The left position of the mouse relative to the element that triggered the event The top position of the mouse relative to the element that triggered the event The original target of the event The previous value of an attribute that was modified The return value for the event  true or false  The left position of the mouse relative to the entire screen The top position of the mouse relative to the entire screen Whether or not the SHIFT key was pressed The element that is the target of the event Whether or not the event was initiated by the browser or the programmer The window object where the event occurred  keyCode offsetX offsetY originalTarget prevValue returnValue screenX screenY shiftKey srcElement trusted view  Table 7-2    Other Event Properties   180  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  While they may prove useful in some circumstances, these properties will not be covered   in further detail here. Instead, you will learn how to use some of the properties from Table 7-1,  which are fully supported in jQuery. The type Property The type property simply returns the type of event that occurred. For example, if the event was  a click, click is returned; if the event was a mouseover, mouseover is returned; and so on.  As an example, the following code would show the event type to the user when it occurs:  $ "my-element" .click function event  {   alert "The event was a " + event.type + "!" ; } ;  This simply sends a pop-up alert that displays the type of event that occurred to the user.  This information can be used for other things as well. Suppose you had an element that   could react to two different types of events: a click and a keypress. Save the following HTML  code as event-type.html:               Event Type          more { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; width:30%; }                        Click for More        This is more text. It can go on and on as long as needed. Sometimes    things like this go on for way too long, huh?        This creates a simple button to show more text, which, when clicked, or when a key is pressed  while over the element, should display the text in the more element, which will be hidden.  This can easily be done by creating a function to handle both events and assigning it to each  event handler. However, you want to perform a slightly different animation when the user  presses a key than when the user clicks the button.   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  181  While you could simply write the different animations into the individual event handlers  rather than calling the single function, a program with longer code would be better suited to  the single function to avoid needing to repeat all of the additional lines of code. Thus, a single  function will be used, but the type property will be used to determine the type of event that  occurred and react with the appropriate event.  In this case, you will use fadeIn   if the button is clicked and slideDown   if a key is   pressed while over the button element. Save the following code as event-type.js:  $ document .ready function event  {   var $moreButton = $ "more-button" ,        $more = $ "more" ;   function showMore $jObj, event  {    event.preventDefault  ;     if  event.type === "click"  {       $jObj.fadeIn 2000 ;     }     if  event.type === "keypress"  {       $jObj.slideDown 2000 ;     }   }   $more.hide  ;   $moreButton.click function event  {     showMore $more, event ;    } ;   $moreButton.keypress function event  {     showMore $more, event ;    } ; } ;  The selected elements are stored as jQuery  objects available for later use  since they will  be used repetitively   Begins a function named showMore  , which will show the element sent to it  as the first argument  $jObj  If the event type is a click, the  element is faded in over 2  seconds  If the event type is a  keypress, the element slides  down over 2 seconds  The more element is hidden When the more-button element  is clicked, showMore   is called,  and the element and the Event object are sent as arguments  When the more-button element has a keypress,  showMore   is called and the  element and the Event object  are sent as arguments  First, the selection of both elements is made, and these are assigned as jQuery objects   in variables for later use, since they will be used more than once in the code. Next, the  showMore   function is defined, which takes a specified jQuery object and specified Event object as arguments. Here, the jQuery object will be $more each time, which is the selection  containing the more element. This and the Event object are passed to the function when the  event handlers are registered later in the script. The default action is prevented, and then the  script checks the event type. If the event is a click, a fade-in occurs; if it is a keypress, a slide- down occurs. If neither is the case, then nothing happens.  The remainder of the code hides the more element initially, then registers the event   handlers for the click and keypress events, which both call the showMore   function and send it  $more and the current Event object as arguments.   182  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  To try this out, open event-type.html in your browser and click the button. This will cause   the element to fade in. Refresh the page and press the tab key to reach the button and then  press any other key. This will cause the element to slide down instead. Figure 7-1 shows the  result of clicking the button while the fade-in is in progress, and Figure 7-2 shows the result of  pressing a key while the slide-down is in progress.  To make the script more interesting, you can use the “toggle” versions of each effect.   When this is done, it will toggle each time the button is clicked or a key is pressed while over  the button—and the effect will be the one specified for the event that occurs. Change the code  in event-type.js to the following and save the file:  $ document .ready function event  {   var $moreButton = $ "more-button" ,        $more = $ "more" ;   function showMore $jObj, event  {    event.preventDefault  ;     if  event.type === "click"  {  Figure 7-1    Clicking the button causes a fade-in.  Figure 7-2    Pressing a key while over the button causes a slide-down.   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  183  The effects are changed to use  fadeToggle   and slideToggle          $jObj.fadeToggle 2000 ;     }     if  event.type === "keypress"  {       $jObj.slideToggle 2000 ;     }   }   $more.hide  ;   $moreButton.click function event  {     showMore $more, event ;    } ;   $moreButton.keypress function event  {     showMore $more, event ;    } ; } ;  Refresh the event-type.html file in your Web browser and either click the button or press the  tab key to access it and press a key. When you click, a fade occurs, and when you press a key,  a slide animation is performed.  The timeStamp Property The timeStamp property contains the number of milliseconds that elapsed from January 1,  1970, to the time the event occurred. While this may not be of particular interest on its own, it  can be used to find out the time difference between two events, which can be useful for testing  where a slowdown is occurring.  The time difference between two events can also be useful if you want to create a simple  game. Suppose you wanted to create a game where the user clicks a “Start” button that, when  clicked, displays another button in a random position on the page for the user to click. When  the user clicks the second button, the time between the two clicks is determined and displayed  to the user to see how fast the second button was clicked.  You already know enough to perform most of the tasks, but there is a little extra to learn  in order to get two random numbers. To do this, you can access the JavaScript Math object,  which offers a random   method that will allow you to generate a random number between  0 and 1. This can be multiplied by another number to allow for additional numbers. The floor    method allows you to take off additional decimal points so that you obtain an integer as the  final number. For example, this code will get a random number from 0 to 4  the counting  begins at zero, so for a range of five random numbers, you will multiply by 5 to get numbers  from 0 to 4 :  var rand = Math.floor Math.random   * 5 ;  Here, Math.random   * 5 generates a random float between 0 and 5, which then has anything  after the decimal point taken off by Math.floor   so that the number ends up being an integer  from 0 to 4.   184  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  With this in mind, you can now combine this with the timeStamp property, some jQuery   animations, and a little math to create the game. First, save the following HTML code as time- game.html:               Time Game                     Start            Click!         This   will display the user’s  time when the second button is  clicked The “Click!” button that the  user will need to find and  click as quickly as possible  The “Start” button that the user  will click to begin  Here, you have two buttons: one to start the game and one that must be found and clicked to  get a time. The msg   will display the amount of time between the click on the “Start”  button and the click on the “Click!” button.  With this in place, you can begin building your script. First, start a JavaScript file and save  it as time-game.js. Then you will set up some variables that will be used within the script and  do an initial hiding of the “Click!” button. Place the following code into the file:  $ document .ready function   {   var $sButton = $ "start-button" ,        $cButton = $ "clicked-button" ,       $msg = $ "msg" ;        sTime = 0,        cTime = 0;   $cButton.hide  ; } ;  Each element is stored for later use  A start time  sTime  and a click time  cTime  are created with initial values of zero The “Click!” button is hidden so that it does  not display on the page when it loads  Now that the initial work is done, you need to handle the first event: a click on the “Start!”   button. Add this code to your time-game.js file:  $sButton.click function event  {   var posX = Math.floor Math.random   * 300 ,       posY = Math.floor Math.random   * 300 ;  Two variables are created   posX and posY , which will  be assigned random numbers  between 0 and 299 and used  for the left and top CSS property  values for the “Click!” button   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  185    event.preventDefault  ;   sTime = event.timeStamp;   $msg.text '' ;   $cButton.css {       position: 'relative',       left: 0,       top: 0   } .animate {left: posX, top: posY }, 0 .show 0 ; } ;  The sTime variable is updated to contain the starting time  stamp  time stamp when the “Start” button was clicked  This effectively does nothing the first time the event occurs, but  clears the message text after each subsequent click so that the  user does not create additional messages  The “Click!” button  currently hidden  is given a relative position of 0,0 with the css   method, then  moved with the animate   method to the new random position and then is shown to the user  Notice that a random integer is set for the variables posX and posY. These values will be used  later to set the left and top position of the button to these random values. Next, the default action  is prevented. The time stamp for when the “Start” button was clicked is retrieved using event .timeStamp and stored in the sTime variable. This will be used in the event handler for the  “Click!” button later. After that, the message  which will display the user’s time to click the  second button  is set to be an empty string. It will be updated each time the user clicks the “Click!” button. Finally, the “Click!” button is repositioned  it needs to be relative for the  animate   method  and then animated to the new position instantly  0 is used for the duration   and then shown  again using 0 for the duration . The user can now click the “Click!” button.  With this set up, you can now code the event handler for the “Click!” button, which will   calculate the time between the two clicks, display the time to the user, and then hide the button  until the user clicks the “Start!” button again. Add this code to your time-game.js file:  The cTime variable is  updated to the value of the  time stamp for when the  button was clicked  The timeDiff variable is  defined and given an  initial value of 0  $cButton.click function event  {   var timeDiff = 0;   event.preventDefault  ;   cTime = event.timeStamp;   timeDiff =  cTime - sTime    1000;   $msg.text 'It took you ' + timeDiff + ' second s  to click the   button!' ;   $cButton.hide 0 ; } ;  The msg   element has its text  updated to show the user how many  seconds it took to click the “Click!”  button  The “Click!” button is hidden  until the “Start” button is  clicked again  The time difference between the two clicks  in  milliseconds  is calculated, then divided by 1000 to  provide the number of seconds, then stored in the  timeDiff variable   186  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Here, you again get the time stamp, which this time will be for the “Click!” button. The time  difference between the two clicks is calculated, made more user-friendly  using seconds  instead of milliseconds , and then displayed in the msg   for the user. Once complete, the  button is again hidden until “Start” is clicked again. The full time-game.js file is shown in the  following code:  $ document .ready function   {   var $sButton = $ "start-button" ,        $cButton = $ "clicked-button" ,       $msg = $ "msg" ;        sTime = 0,        cTime = 0;   $cButton.hide  ;   $sButton.click function event  {     var posX = Math.floor Math.random   * 300 ,         posY = Math.floor Math.random   * 300 ;     event.preventDefault  ;     sTime = event.timeStamp;     $msg.text '' ;     $cButton.css {         position: 'relative',         left: 0,         top: 0     } .animate {left: posX, top: posY }, 0 .show 0 ;   } ;   $cButton.click function event  {     var timeDiff = 0;     event.preventDefault  ;     cTime = event.timeStamp;     timeDiff =  cTime - sTime    1000;     $msg.text 'It took you ' + timeDiff + ' second s  to click the     button!' ;     $cButton.hide 0 ;   } ; } ;  Save the time-game.js file and open the time-game.html file in your browser. Click the “Start”  button to begin, and try to click the “Click!” button as fast as you can! The result will be  displayed once the “Click!” button is clicked. Figure 7-3 shows the initial page, and Figure 7-4  shows one possible result after the “Click!” button is clicked.   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  187  Figure 7-3    The initial page  Figure 7-4    The message is displayed.  The which Property The which property contains the code of a pressed key or the code for the mouse button that  was pressed. In jQuery, it makes these codes consistent across browsers so that you can more  easily write code based on the information returned. Mouse Clicks When used with mouse events, the which property will return 1 if the left mouse button was  pressed, 2 for the middle button, and 3 for the right button. This allows you to write different  code depending on which mouse button was clicked.  For example, you could alert the value of the which property when a mouse button is   pressed over an element. Save the following code as mouse-button.html:               Mouse Button                     Click      188  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide       This provides a button where you can determine which mouse button was pressed while over it  using the mousedown event. Save the following code as mouse-button.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "mouse-button" .mousedown function event  {     alert event.which ;   } ; } ;  Open the mouse-button.html file in your browser and try pressing any of the three mouse  buttons while over the “Click” button. You should receive a different number  1, 2, or 3  depending on which mouse button was pressed. Key Presses When used with keyboard events, the which property will return the key code of the pressed key.  For example, if the j key is pressed, it will return 74. Other keys have their codes as well, so you  can find out which key was pressed and write code to be run when specific keys are pressed.  For example, suppose you want to show hide different   elements depending on which   keys are pressed. By using the value of which, you can provide different results for different  key presses.  To begin, save the following HTML code as keydown.html:               KeyDown                 Widget 147 Version 43.02    Press "U" for current updates or "W" to view our latest Widget tweets.

Thanks for letting us know about them!       Chapter 7:  The Event Object  189         Tweets  Press "W" again to hide            Widget 147:  Just released version 43.02!       http:  widget147.com  v43-02.php             This provides the main  , which gives the instructions, followed by two   elements  that will be hidden when the page loads. These will be revealed when the user presses the  specified key on the keyboard.  To do this, you can use the which property to determine which key was pressed and take   the appropriate action. Save the following code as keydown.js:  $ document .ready function   {   var $news = $ "news" ,        $tweets = $ "tweets" ;   $news.hide  ;   $tweets.hide  ;   $ document .keydown function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     if  event.which === 85  {     "U" pressed       $news.slideToggle 1000 ;     }     if  event.which === 87  {     "W" pressed       $tweets.slideToggle 1000 ;     }   } ; } ;  The code for the U key is 85  The code for the W key is 87  Load the keydown.html page in your browser and press either key to toggle the appropriate    element in and out of view. Pressing other keys that do not otherwise have functionality   for example, f3 or ctrl-f will open the Find dialog in Firefox  will simply do nothing.  Figure 7-5 shows the initial page, and Figure 7-6 shows how the page would look after the  w key is pressed the first time.  With that in mind, you have to be careful when using key presses that you use keys that   are not used for essential purposes and could override important functionality. Also, if you use  the accesskey attribute for site navigation, you will want to be careful not to use any of those  specified keys either.   190  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 7-5 The initial page  Figure 7-6 The page after the W key is pressed.  The keydown event is used in order to keep other possible codes from being used    sometimes the code for keypress or keyup is different from the target key due to the use of  shift or other modifiers . If you need to look up a code or want to see these differences, you  can use the JavaScript and jQuery Key Code Checker tool found at www.west-wind.com  WestwindWebToolkit samples Ajax html5andCss3 keycodechecker.aspx to get the codes you need.

Middle-clicking the   element will toggle the menu.   continued    192  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This Summary  Event Methods  In this project, you used your knowledge of the codes returned by the which property to perform  different actions based on which mouse button was clicked while over a   element.  In addition to its properties, the Event object has several useful methods that can be used with  jQuery. These are listed in Table 7-3.  You have already used the preventDefault   method, so the following sections will cover   the use of stopPropagation   and stopImmediatePropagation  . The stopPropagation   Method The stopPropagation   method stops the event from bubbling up to any further parent elements  that could handle the event. One way this bubbling can happen is with nested elements of the  same type. For example, consider the following code  save as stop-prop.html :               Stop Propagation          .outer { border:solid 1px 000; padding:15px; width:400px; }     .inner { border:solid 1px 000; padding:5px; width:300px; }                       Outer...         Inner...  Description Whether or not preventDefault   has been called  Method isDefaultPrevented   isImmediatePropagationStopped   Whether or not stopImmediatePropagation   has been called isPropagationStopped   preventDefault   stopImmediatePropagation    Whether or not stopPropagation   has been called Prevents the default action Stops any further event handlers on the element from triggering  and stops event bubbling Stops event bubbling  stopPropagation    Table 7-3    Event Object Methods in jQuery   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  193              Inner...            If you wanted to append some text to each   element that is clicked, you might write the  following jQuery code  save as stop-prop.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "div" .click function event  {     $ this .append " You clicked this element!" ;   } ; } ;  Load the stop-prop.html file in your browser and click one of the inner   elements. While   the intention of the script was probably to simply append the text to any   element that was  clicked, the event will bubble up to the parent  outer    element as well, which causes both    elements to have the text appended, even though you only clicked an inner one. Figure 7-7  shows the initial page, and Figure 7-8 shows the page after the first inner   element is clicked.  Figure 7-7 The initial page  Figure 7-8 The page after the first inner   is clicked.   194  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  To fix this to work as intended, you can use the stopPropagation   method to prevent the   event from bubbling up any further. This will keep the outer   element from attempting to  handle the event when one of the inner   elements is clicked. Edit the stop-prop.js file to  use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "div" .click function event  {     event.stopPropagation  ;     $ this .append " You clicked this element!" ;   } ; } ;  The stopPropagation   method is used, preventing  the event from bubbling up  the DOM tree  Reload the stop-prop.html file in your browser and click an inner  . This time, it won’t  cause the outer   to also have the text appended. The text will now only be appended to  the outer   if you actually click within the outer   outside of any of the inner    elements. Figure 7-9 shows the result of clicking an inner   element with this in place. The stopImmediatePropagation   Method The stopImmediatePropagation   method stops the event from bubbling up further and also  prevents any further event handlers for that event from running. As an example, you will build  on the previous page. Save the following HTML code as stop-i-prop.html:               Stop Immediate Propagation          .outer { border:solid 1px 000; padding:15px; width:400px; }     .inner { border:solid 1px 000; padding:5px; width:300px; }           Figure 7-9 The outer   no longer gets the text appended when an inner   is clicked.   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  195               Outer...         Inner...             Inner...            To see the difference between this and stopPropagation  , you will first simply add a second  click event handler for   elements, as in the following code  save as stop-i-pro.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "div" .click function event  {     event.stopPropagation  ;     $ this .append " You clicked this element!" ;   } ;   $ "div" .click function event  {     $ this .css "background-color", "FFD" ;   } ; } ;  This will highlight each   when it is clicked by changing the background color. Since  stopPropagation   is called in the first click event handler, this effect won’t bubble up and each    element is highlighted individually when clicked  additional clicks simply add more text  since the element will already be highlighted . Figure 7-10 shows an example of this when the  first inner   element is clicked.  Figure 7-10 The first inner   element is highlighted.   196  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Suppose, however, that you do not want the highlight effect and instead just want to run  the first event handler, which adds the text. Using stopImmediatePropagation   will not only  keep the event from bubbling up any further, but it will also stop all additional event handlers  for that event from executing. To see this in action, change the stop-i-prop.js file to use the  following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "div" .click function event  {     event.stopImmediatePropagation  ;     $ this .append " You clicked this element!" ;   } ;   $ "div" .click function event  {     $ this .css "background-color", "FFD" ;   } ; } ;  Reload the stop-i-prop.html file in your browser and click one of the inner   elements.  It should now only add the text to the element rather than adding the text and highlighting.  Figure 7-11 shows the result after the first inner   element is clicked. The “is” Methods The isDefaultPrevented  , isPropagationStopped  , and isImmediatePropagationStopped   methods return true or false depending on whether or not their corresponding methods,  preventDefault  , stopPropagation  , and stopImmediatePropagation  , have been called.  For example, isDefaultPrevented   can be handy if you need to know whether   preventDefault   has already been called. In this way, you can call it if needed, as in the  following code:  $ ".special a" .click function event  {   if  !event.isDefaultPrevented    {     event.preventDefault  ;   }      Additional code for the click event... } ;  Figure 7-11 The   element is no longer highlighted.   Chapter 7:  The Event Object  197  The other methods can be used in the same way to test for whether or not stopPropagation    or stopImmediatePropagation   have been called.  Try This 7-2  Practice Stopping Propagation  pr07-02.html pr07-02.js  This project allows you to practice using the stopPropagation   method of  the Event object by using it to stop an event from bubbling up to any parent  elements.

Which of the following properties of the Event object does not have cross-browser support    Chapter8  The DOM and Forms  201   202  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Key Skills & Concepts              ●  ●  Form Element Values  Form Events  ● Regular Expressions  ●  Form Validation  The jQuery library offers a number of helpful tools for dealing with HTML forms. You can   use jQuery to get the value of various form element inputs, make use of form events and  methods, and put all of these together with techniques such as regular expressions and others  that you have learned earlier to validate form input.  Form Element Values  The jQuery library provides a helpful method named val  , which allows you to get or set  values for matched elements. You can also use various techniques to work with special  elements such as check boxes, radio buttons, and select boxes. The val   Method The val   method allows you to get or set the values of form elements. Getting Values The val   method can get the value of the first matched element in a set of elements. This can be  used with an id as the selector in order to obtain the value of a specific form element. For example,  the following code can be used to get the value of an element with an id of textbox-name:  $ "textbox-name" .val  ;  If the selection matches more than one element, then val   will only retrieve the value of the  first matched element. Consider the following code:  $ "input[type=text]" .val  ;  The selection will be all of the text boxes on the page, but val   will only get the value of the  first text box.  If instead you want to do something with the value of each of the text boxes, you can   iterate over the collection using each  , as in the following code:  $ "input[type=text]" .each function   {   $ "my-element" .append $ this .val   + " " ; } ;   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  203  This will append each value to my-element to be viewed on the page. You could do several  things within the each   handling function, from validation to storing the values for later use.  You’ll look at some of these options later in this chapter.  NOTE If a text input field is left empty, its value will be an empty string  “”  and not  “undefined”. Otherwise, the value will be the characters that were typed into the field in  string format.  To see an example of val  , save the following HTML code as val.html:             The val   Method                         Name:                 E-mail:                                 Next, save the following code as val.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "contact-form" .submit function event  {     $ "input[type=text]" .each function   {       $ "show-vals" .append $ this .val   + " " ;     } ;     event.preventDefault  ;   } ; } ;  The default action is prevented   the form is not submitted   A handler is added  for the submit event  Each of the text boxes  is collected and iterated  over using each    The value of each of the  text boxes is displayed   followed by a line break   by appending the value to  the show-vals element  Figure 8-1 shows the initial page, and Figure 8-2 shows how the page would look after  entering “John” for the name and “me@scripttheweb.com” for the e-mail address and clicking  the Submit button once.   204  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 8-1 The initial page  Figure 8-2 The page after the Submit button is clicked once.  Setting Values The val   method can also be used to set the value for all matched elements. Using the same  HTML code  val.html , edit the val.js file to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {     $ "input[type=text]" .val "Enter Value" ; } ;  Notice that this works much like other jQuery methods that set values. This will set the value   of all of the text boxes to have an initial value of “Enter Value”. Figure 8-3 shows the val.html file after being loaded in a browser.  Note that this isn’t all that helpful and forces the user to delete the initial text and type  the new value. However, setting the value for each field individually could be more useful,  especially if you had the user’s name and e-mail address stored  such as in a cookie or  localStorage  and filled these in for the user so that the information does not need to be typed  at all. As with other things, what will be most helpful for you and your visitors will depend on  your specific situation.   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  205  Figure 8-3 Both text boxes have their value set by the script.  Ask the Expert Q: Does val   work with radio buttons and check boxes? A: Yes! It will return the value of the value attribute for the selected element. However, it will   not tell you whether the element was checked or not. For example, suppose you have a  radio button as in the following code:     Using alert $ “food” .val   ; will alert “pizza” whether the element was checked or not.  You can either select elements that were checked by adding :checked to the selector, for  example, $ “input[type=radio]:checked” , or you can used the checked property provided  in JavaScript to determine whether or not the element is checked.  Q: Well then, does it work with select elements? A: Yes! For select elements that only allow a single selection, it will return the value of the  value attribute for the selected option. If the element allows multiple selections, then val   will return a comma-separated list of the value of the value attribute of each selection  option.  Q: Can values be obtained via JavaScript instead? A: Yes, though when selecting more than one element, the jQuery library makes it easier  to do so cross-browser so that you do not need to write extra code to account for those  differences. If you want to get the value of an element using its id in JavaScript, you can  do so like this:  var emailValue = document.getElementById "E-mail" .value;  This would get the value of the “E-mail” field on the page and assign it to the emailValue variable.   206  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Form Events  Form elements have a number of events that can be bound to them with their corresponding  methods; these are listed in Table 8-1. The blur   and focus   Methods The blur event occurs when the focus is taken away from an element; for example, clicking  outside the element or pressing the tab key to access another element. This can be used to test  input in a field once the user leaves it. As an example, save the following HTML code as  form-events.html:  Some basic CSS is added to provide font styles and spacing; the  .err-msg class is used in an empty   after each element, which  will provide messages via jQuery code to the user as needed             Form Events          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }     .form-element { margin:0.8em 0; }     contact-form label { font-weight:bold; }     .err-msg { padding-left:12px; color:900; font-weight:bold; }                       Contact Us                   Name:                                           E-mail:    Method blur   change    focus   select   submit    Description The focus is taken away from an element The value of the element is changed in some way  typing text, selecting an item,  and so on  The focus is given to an element Text is selected within an element    and   elements only  The form is submitted    elements only   Table 8-1 Methods That Can Be Bound to Various Elements Within Forms   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  207                                          Topic:                        Choose...             Praise             Problems                                          Comments:                                              As you can see, there are two text boxes, a select box, and a text area. Suppose you want to  ensure that a name is entered into the name text box once the user removes focus from it. You  can do this by using the blur   method on the name element.  For example, you could use the following code  save as form-events.js :  The selected elements are  assigned to variables  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,       $errName = $ "err-name" ;   $name.blur function   {     $errName.empty  ;     if  $name.val  .length < 1  {       $errName.empty  .append 'Name is required!' ;     }   } ; } ;  The blur event is bound  to the name field  Makes sure there is no  content in the err-name   element before  checking it  this ensures it is  cleared if there is no error  and that the same message  doesn’t appear more than  once if there is an error   The val   method is used to get the current value of the element, and the  length property is used to determine the number of characters in that value;  if less than 1, then the error message is appended to the err-name element  Binding the blur event to the name element will cause the handling function to execute   when the field loses focus  by clicking another element, tabbing, and so on . When this happens,  the err-name   element is cleared of any content by using empty  . This ensures that the    is empty before the message is appended, keeping the message from duplicating if the  blur event occurs more than once before the error is fixed. The script then checks to see if the  length of the element’s value is less than 1, which indicates nothing was entered in the field. If  that is the case, the empty err-name   element has an error message appended to it.   208  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  To try this out, load the form-events.html page in your browser. Click the “Name:” field,   and then anywhere outside the field without entering any information. The error message should  display after the field. To remove the error, go back and enter at least one character into the  field and then remove the focus from it again. Figure 8-4 shows the initial page, and Figure 8-5  shows the page after the field loses focus without any text being entered.  This is one method that can be used to validate fields as the user moves through the form,   but you can also use the change   method, which will be discussed in the next section.  Figure 8-4 The initial page  Figure 8-5 The page after the “Name:” field loses focus without any data being entered.   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  209  If you want to take the opposite approach—providing a helpful hint for the user when a   field receives focus—then the focus   method is a good choice. For example, if you wanted to  provide users with a message reminding them to include the @ symbol in their e-mail address,  you could use the following code:  var $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,     $errEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ; $eMail.focus function   {   $errEMail.append 'Remember the @ sign!' ; } ;  This is fairly straightforward, appending the message when the user clicks the field.  However, it does not remove the message once the user leaves. This can be done by also  attaching the blur   method, which you can do as part of the chain, as in the following code:  var $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,     $errEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ; $eMail.focus function   {   $errEMail.append 'Remember the @ sign!' ; } .blur function   {   $errEMail.empty  ; } ;  When the field loses focus, the message is now removed by using the empty   method. You   can now update your form-events.js file to include this new code. Use the following code:  The variables are  all placed together  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,       $errName = $ "err-name" ,       $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,       $errEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ;   $name.blur function   {     $errName.empty  ;     if  $name.val  .length < 1  {       $errName.empty  .append 'Name is required!' ;     }   } ;   $eMail.focus function   {     $errEMail.append 'Remember the @ sign!' ;   } .blur function   {     $errEMail.empty  ;   } ; } ;  Code to handle  the name field  Code to handle the  e-mail field  Save the form-events.js file and refresh the form-events.html file in your browser. Click   the “E-mail” field and the hint will appear after it. Figure 8-6 shows the page once the hint has  been displayed.   210  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 8-6 The hint is displayed when the “E-mail” field receives focus.  The change   Method The change event occurs when a change is made to an element. For text boxes and text areas,  this is when the user enters or deletes characters; for select boxes, when the user makes a  different or additional selection; for radio buttons and check boxes, when one is checked or  unchecked.  Working with your current form-events.html page, you can use the change   method for   the select box. Suppose you want to provide a different response to each selection the user can  make. Since the “Choose…” option is already selected, selecting it will do nothing unless you  change it to something else first. The other options will all be available for scripting on the first  change event.  The following code can be used to make this work:  The elements that will be used  are assigned to variables  var $topic = $ "topic" ,      $errTopic = $ "err-topic" ; $topic.change function   {   var choice = $topic.val  ;   $errTopic.empty  ;   switch choice  {     case "Praise"   : $errTopic.append "Cool! Thanks!" ; break;     case "Problems" : $errTopic.append "Oh no..." ; break;     default         : $errTopic.append "Please make a selection." ;   } } ;  The change   method is used on the topic select element The err-topic   is emptied  A switch statement is used to  determine which message to append   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  211  Here, the same process is followed, but a JavaScript switch statement is used to determine  which message to append to the   element based on the value chosen in the select  element. The switch Statement The switch statement can save you some time when you need to write multiple if else statements based on the same value. In the example, the value selected by the user gets  assigned to a variable named choice. Since there are multiple values that can be chosen and the  list could be expanded in the future, a switch statement will help organize the code a bit.  A switch statement uses the following basic format:  switch expression  {   case expression : statements;   default : statements; }  The expression within the parentheses can be any expression, but is most commonly a   variable value, as with the example, which uses the choice variable. This is followed by one  or more case statements, which evaluate whether the value is equal to the expression. In the  example, you just used the first two possible selections  “Praise” and “Problems” . If the case  returns true, then the statements following the colon are executed. If not, then it moves on to  the next case, then the next, and so on. If none of the cases returns true, then the default case is  used. In the example, the “Choose…” option that is a placeholder will go to the default case,  which asks the user to make a valid selection.  Look at the example code again to see how it works:  switch choice  {   case "Praise"   : $errTopic.append "Cool! Thanks!" ; break;   case "Problems" : $errTopic.append "Oh no..." ; break;   default         : $errTopic.append "Please make a selection." ; }  You will see that if choice is equal to “Praise”, then the   will have the “Cool! Thanks!”  message appended to it. This is followed by a break statement, which exits the switch statement.  The break statement is necessary in order to keep the case from “falling through” to the  next one and executing those statements as well. For example, forgetting the break statement  after the “Problems” case will result in both the “Oh no…” and “Please make a selection”  messages being appended to the   element if “Problems” is selected, because this will  cause the default case statements to be executed as well. Adding the New Code to form-events.js You can now add this to your form-events.js file, as shown in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,        $errName = $ "err-name" ,        $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,   212  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The variables are placed with the others        $errEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ,        $topic = $ "topic" ,        $errTopic = $ "err-topic" ;    $name.blur function   {     $errName.empty  ;     if  $name.val  .length < 1  {       $errName.empty  .append 'Name is required!' ;     }   } ;   $eMail.focus function   {     $errEMail.append 'Remember the @ sign!' ;   } .blur function   {     $errEMail.empty  ;   } ;   $topic.change function   {     var choice = $topic.val  ;     $errTopic.empty  ;     switch choice  {       case "Praise"   : $errTopic.append "Cool! Thanks!" ; break;       case "Problems" : $errTopic.append "Oh no..." ; break;       default         : $errTopic.append "Please make a selection." ;     }   } ; } ;  The remainder of the  code is added here  Save the form-events.js file and reload the form-events.html page in your browser. Try selecting  the various options to get the different messages. Figure 8-7 shows the result of selecting the  “Problems” option.  Figure 8-7 The message for selecting the “Problems” option is displayed.   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  213  The select   Method The select event occurs when a user selects text within a text box or text area. For example,  you could use the following code to offer a tip if the user selects some text:  var $comments = $ "comments" ,      $errComments = $ "err-comments" ; $comments.select function   {   $errComments.empty  ;   $errComments.append "If using Windows, Press CTRL+A to select all." ; } .blur function   {   $errComments.empty  ; } ;  Just as with the other events, the contents of the associated   element are first emptied,  then the message is appended. The additional blur   method is chained on to allow the message  to be cleared again once the user leaves the field.  You can now add this to your code. Update the form-events.js file to use the following code:  The elements are placed in variables  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,        $errName = $ "err-name" ,        $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,       $errEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ,        $topic = $ "topic" ,        $errTopic = $ "err-topic" ,        $comments = $ "comments" ,        $errComments = $ "err-comments" ;   $name.blur function   {     $errName.empty  ;     if  $name.val  .length < 1  {       $errName.empty  .append 'Name is required!' ;     }   } ;   $eMail.focus function   {     $errEMail.append 'Remember the @ sign!' ;   } .blur function   {     $errEMail.empty  ;   } ;   $topic.change function   {     var choice = $topic.val  ;     $errTopic.empty  ;     switch choice  {       case "Praise"   : $errTopic.append "Cool! Thanks!" ; break;       case "Problems" : $errTopic.append "Oh no..." ; break;       default         : $errTopic.append "Please make a selection." ;     }   } ;   214  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide    $comments.select function   {     $errComments.empty  ;     $errComments.append "If using Windows, Press CTRL+A to select  all." ;   } .blur function   {     $errComments.empty  ;   } ; } ;  The code to handle the “Comments:” field is added  Save the form-events.js file and reload the form-events.html file in your browser. Type some  text into the “Comments:” field and then make a text selection. The “tip” will appear  which is  only helpful to Windows users . Figure 8-8 shows the page after some text is selected.  While this provides an example of the submit   method, you can create more useful scripts   for text selection by using a jQuery plugin such as jQuery TextRange  http:  plugins.jquery .com textrange  , which will allow you to get, set, and replace selected text. Plugins will be  discussed in more detail in Chapter 10. The submit   Method The submit event occurs when a form is submitted. You have already been using the submit   method to handle form submissions and perform various actions. Later in the chapter, you will  see how it can be used to provide a final validation on the client side before you submit the  form to a server-side program.  Regular Expressions  JavaScript includes regular expressions, which can give you more flexibility when you need to  validate form fields for specific character patterns.  Figure 8-8 The “tip” is displayed when text is selected.   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  215  For example, you may want to know if a valid phone number or e-mail address was   entered. Regular expressions can test the entered data against a pattern you provide to  determine whether the data matches the pattern. This gives you the ability to more accurately  validate some form fields.  It should be noted that HTML5 provides a means for validating common types of patterns,  such as telephone numbers, dates, e-mail addresses, and fields that simply require input. Until  this is widely implemented, you may wish to use JavaScript as a fallback for browsers that do  not support the new elements and validation routines yet. However, you can also bypass the  JavaScript fallback and allow the server-side program to validate the fields in older browsers. Creating Regular Expressions You need to create an instance of the JavaScript RegExp object or a RegExp literal in order  to use a regular expression. In this chapter, you will simply use a RegExp literal, as it can use  the methods needed to test the pattern. To create a RegExp literal, you can assign the regular  expression to a variable. Instead of using quotation marks to surround the expression, you use  forward     slashes, as shown here:  var varname =  your_pattern ;  You replace your_pattern with a regular expression pattern.  NOTE JavaScript uses forward slashes to let the browser know that a regular expression is  between them, the same way quote marks are used to set off strings. Thus, if a forward  slash is used within the regular expression, it must be escaped with a backslash in order  to work properly. For instance, instead of writing  02 03 2009 , you would need to  write  02\ 03\ 2009 .  For example, a simple regular expression pattern, which will match when a specific   character sequence occurs anywhere within a string, can be created like this:  var myPattern =  our ;  The preceding code creates a RegExp literal named myPattern. If you test the word our against  the expression, it’s a match. If you test your, sour, pour, or pouring against the pattern, then it  also returns a match. If you test cool, Our, OUR, or souR, then it won’t return a match, since  none of these strings have “our” in them  capitalization matters unless the i flag is used, which  is discussed later in this section . Testing Strings Against Regular Expressions You can use the test   method of the RegExp object to test a string against a regular expression.  The basic syntax is as follows:  regex_pattern.test string_to_test ;   216  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  For instance, consider the following example:  var myPattern =  our ; var isMatch = myPattern.test "pour" ;  This code will test the “pour” string against the regular expression named “tomatch.” The test   method returns true if there is a match and false if there is not a match. In this case, the value  of isMatch will be true, since the test will return true  “our” is found within “pour” .  To create more specific patterns, you’ll need to learn additional characters that can be used   within regular expressions to create those patterns. These characters are listed in Table 8-2.  As you can see, there is an extensive set of characters that can be used to create  patterns. For example,  [a-z]  would create a range that matches all lowercase letters  between a and z. You can build on this by using  ^[a-z]{3,5}$ , which would match all  lowercase letters from a–z if any of the characters within the range occur in a sequence   Character ^ $ * + ? .  x     {x}  {x,}  {x,y}  []  [^]  \ [\b]  Description Matches only from the beginning of a line Matches only at the end of the line Matches the character preceding it if the character occurs zero or more times Matches the character preceding it if it occurs one or more times Matches the character preceding it if it occurs zero or one time Matches any individual character, excluding the newline character By replacing x with characters, matches that sequence and keeps it in memory to be  used later; used for grouping of expressions Used as a logical OR symbol to allow a match of what is on the left of the symbol OR  what is on its right Using a number to replace x, matches when there are exactly x occurrences of the  character preceding it Using a number to replace x, matches when there are x or more occurrences of the  character preceding it Using numbers to replace x and y, matches when there are at least x occurrences of the  character preceding it but no more than y occurrences of it Matches a character set of your choice; will match when any one of the characters in the  brackets  such as [abc]  or any one of a range of characters  such as [a–k]  is present Matches when the characters in your character set are not present; may be a set  such  as [abc]  or a range  such as [a–k]  Used to escape special characters or to make a normal character special Matches a BACKSPACE keystroke  Table 8-2 Special Characters in Regular Expressions   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  217  Character \b  \B \cX  \d \D \f \n \r \s \S \t \v \w \W  Description Matches when the character before or after it is located at a word boundary, such as  before or after a space character Matches a character that is not located at a word boundary Using a letter character to replace X, matches when the user presses the CTRL key  followed by typing the letter X Matches if the character is a single numeric character Matches a single character if it is not a numeric character Matches if there is a form feed Matches if there is a new line Matches if there is a carriage return Matches a single character if it represents white space  such as a space or a new line  Matches a single character if it does not represent white space Matches if there is a tab Matches if there is a vertical tab Matches any single character that is a letter, number, or underscore Matches any single character that is not a letter, number, or underscore  Table 8-2 Special Characters in Regular Expressions  continued   between three and five times from the start to the end of the string. In other words,  strings such as “ace,” “cool,” and “bikes” would match, while strings such as “as”  valid  characters but too short , “234”  invalid characters , “superfluous”  valid characters  but too long , and “$me = 2”  invalid characters  would not. This type of pattern can be  helpful when validating forms, since you can determine the type and number of characters  a field will accept.  Using Flags In addition to all of the characters, you can use flags after the ending forward slash     to  further refine a regular expression pattern, as listed in Table 8-3.  For example, if you want to make a pattern case insensitive, you can easily do so by adding   i to the end of the regular expression, as in the following code:  var myPattern =  [a-z] i;  This pattern now accepts all lowercase and all uppercase letters.   218  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Flag s  i g m  Purpose Makes the match case insensitive Makes the match global Makes the match work in multiline mode  Table 8-3 Flags That Can Be Added at the End of Regular Expressions  If you are interested in delving further into regular expressions, a more in-depth study  of regular expressions can be found at www.regular-expressions.info tutorial.html. For the  purposes of this beginner’s book on jQuery, you will use some fairly straightforward patterns  to assist in form validation, but you can learn much more on regular expressions if desired by  visiting the referenced site.  Try This 8-1  Practice Using Regular Expressions  pr08-01.html pr08-01.js  This project allows you to practice using regular expressions by applying one to  a form input and validating that the data entered matches the regular expression  pattern.  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr08-01.html:               Project 8-1                   Name:                        Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  219  2. In the pr08-01.js file, add jQuery JavaScript code that will check the value of the name  element when it loses focus to ensure that it matches the following regular expression:   ^[a-z ]+$ i  If it does not match, display an error message that states “Only letters and spaces are   allowed.” If it does match, the message should not display.  3. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,       $errName = $ "err-name" ;   $name.blur function   {       var myPattern =  ^[a-z ]+$ i;       $errName.empty  ;       if  !myPattern.test $name.val     {         $errName.append "Only letters and spaces are allowed" ;       }   } ; } ;  4. Open the pr08-01.html file in your Web browser. Try entering different types of data into   the field. If the field contains anything other than letters and spaces, you should receive the  error message when you leave the field.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of regular expressions and form events to validate  a field once the user leaves it. This allowed you to ensure that the field contained only your  predefined set of characters.  Form Validation  Form validation can be quite a task to undertake, since there are a number of tasks that must  be accomplished to not only validate the form, but also to make the form as user-friendly as  possible to assist those who are filling in the information.  The following is a list of some of the things you will need to consider while you are   developing a form for users:   ● What can be done to help the user in the HTML code?  Accessibility, helpful input types   or attributes, and so on.   indications.    ● What can be done to help the user via client-side scripting?  Helpful hints or other    220  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide   ● What validation can be performed on the client side prior to the submission of the form to  a server-side program?  Validate character patterns, whether required information is filled  in, and so on.    ● Everything must be validated on the server side to prevent security issues and allow as little   bad data as possible to be entered.  Since you are learning a client-side technology, you won’t need to deal with the final point   at this time  though it is still very important . The remainder of the tasks can be taken care of  on the “front end”  the server-side programming would be the “back end” .  To deal with the first three points, you will look at each in sequence while building a short   contact form. First, you will look at what can be done with the HTML code, briefly covering  accessibility and helpful HTML5 elements and attributes. Next, you will look at one method of  adding helpful hints for the users as they move through the form. After that, you will perform a  final client-side validation routine when the user clicks the “Submit” button. Helpful HTML for Forms With forms, there are helpful things you can do to make them accessible, as well as helpful  new HTML5 input types and attributes that can enhance the experience for those who have the  latest browsers. First, take a look at form accessibility. Form Accessibility The first thing you will want to do with a form is to make sure it is accessible to everyone  who needs to be able to use it. If customers are filling out your form to purchase items, you  certainly don’t want to lose any of them simply because they do not have the latest browser,  don’t have JavaScript enabled, or use assistive technology to navigate your Web site.  While this book cannot go into great detail, there are a few basic things you can do to help   ensure that your forms are usable for as many people as possible:   ● Using proper element and label order   ● Using   elements   ● Using   elements   ● Marking required fields   ● Not assuming client-side scripting is available Element and Label Order  The order of form input elements and their label text can make  a difference. In most cases  text boxes, text areas, select boxes, and so on , it is preferable to  have the label text directly before the input field, as in the following code:  Name:     Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  221  Most assistive technology can pick up that the label text is intended for the field directly  following it, even if the   element is missing for some reason.  For radio buttons and check boxes, it is preferable to have the label text directly after the   field, as in the following code:    Pizza  Again, this helps assistive technologies to more easily determine which label text goes with  which element, though the   element may be missing. Using   Elements enclosed label text is intended to describe. This strengthens the tie between the two when  they are already ordered as described previously, but can also help when the label text and  input field are separated for some reason, such as being in different table cells or in an  unexpected order.   You can use the   element to specify what field the   To use the   element, you simply wrap the label text within it, and use the for   attribute to point to the id of the form field it should describe, as in the following code:   Name:     As you can see, the value of the for attribute matches the value of the id attribute of the field it  is describing. Using   Elements in a logical way. While it can be used with any group of elements that are tied together by a  common theme,   is particularly helpful with radio buttons and check boxes, where  the label text refers to each individual choice, rather than the overall request. For example,  consider the following code:   The   element can be used to group elements together   What is your favorite food?       Pizza        Burgers        Chocolate   Each label is tied to its individual radio button, which leaves the overall question on   its own. To tie these together, you can wrap everything inside a   element and the  question within a   element, as in the following code:       What is your favorite food?            Pizza            Burgers    <input type="radio" name="food" id="food-Chocolate"  value="Chocolate">   222  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide       Chocolate     This helps to tie everything together for the user and assistive technology.  Most browsers implement some default styling for   elements  many use   a border , so you may need to adjust the styling in your CSS code to fit the needs of  your form. Marking Required Fields  When a field is required, it is helpful for users to know this in  advance so that they can be sure to fill in any necessary information. While marking a field  in a different color, such as red, can be helpful, color should not be used as the only way of  conveying essential information. Instead, marking required fields is often done either using  an asterisk or by adding text to state the requirement.  For example, one way to add an asterisk is shown in the following code:   Name  *        The asterisk is additionally wrapped in an element with a title attribute that states it is required.  Alternatively, you can explicitly state the requirement, as in the following code:   Name  required :        Either method can help the user determine what fields must contain information to proceed. Not Assuming Client-Side Scripting  In order to ensure that the form will be usable for  all of your visitors, you will need to make sure that any actions the users need to take can be  performed without client-side scripting like jQuery JavaScript.  One example of this is when scripting is used in such a way that the user cannot submit the   form without scripting enabled. Consider the following code:       Submit     This won’t work without  JavaScript enabled!  Notice that a link is used rather than a standard submit button and that the destination of  the link is to run some JavaScript code, which would then submit the form via the script.  Unfortunately for users without JavaScript enabled, the form can be completely filled out, but  the link will not do anything at all!  This can be avoided by using a standard submit button and performing any scripting  via the submit event for the form. The following code changes the link to a submit button  to fix this:            Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  223  From here, you can perform any scripting you need to do, such as validation, by including  a separate .js file and using the submit event to perform any scripting for those that have  JavaScript enabled. Those that do not will still be able to submit the form to the server-side  program for validation and completion. Helping the User With all of the previous information in mind, you can now do some additional things that can  be helpful to the user and assist you in the validation process. First, you will take a look at  some new HTML5 input types and attributes. You will then use your knowledge of form events  to provide some messages to users as they move through your form to assist them in entering  the information in the format you need. New Input Types and Attributes in HTML5 HTML5 provides a number of new input types and attributes that can assist you and your  users. The input types are new values that can be used for the type attribute of the    element. These new types offer more flexible input options for the user and can help you  validate the information more easily. Table 8-4 shows the new input types available in HTML5. Each of the new input types can be helpful in browsers that support them. For example, the   email type will validate that the entered e-mail address uses valid characters and contains the  @ symbol. An example of using this is shown in the following code:   E-mail:     Type color date datetime datetime-local email month number range search tel time  url week  Description Provides a tool to choose a color Provides a tool to choose a date Provides a tool to choose a date and time  UTC time  Provides a tool to choose a date and time  not UTC  Designed for e-mail address entry Provides a tool to enter a year value and a month value Designed to accept only numerical input Provides a tool to choose a range Designed for entering a value to be placed in a search Designed for entering a telephone number Designed for a time value to be entered with hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional  seconds Designed for entering a URL Designed for entering a week  Table 8-4 New HTML5 Input Types   224  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 8-9 An invalid e-mail address is highlighted by the browser.  Figure 8-9 shows what happens in Firefox when an invalid e-mail address is entered into   an email field.  In addition to the new input types, there are a number of new attributes that can be used   with forms and or form elements. These are listed in Table 8-5.  For the purposes of this chapter, you will look at the required and pattern attributes. Further   information on the remaining HTML5 form elements and attributes can be found at www .adobe.com devnet dreamweaver articles html5-forms-pt1.html in a helpful series from Adobe.  Attribute autocomplete autofocus dirname form formaction formenctype  formmethod  formnovalidate  formtarget pattern placeholder novalidate required  Description Determines whether or not autocomplete will be available for form fields An element with this attribute will have the focus placed on it when the page loads Indicates the direction of the input Specifies the form with which the element is associated For   elements—overrides the value of the   element’s action attribute For   elements—overrides the value of the   element’s enctype  attribute For   elements—overrides the value of the   element’s method  attribute For   elements—overrides the value of the   element’s novalidate  attribute For   elements—overrides the value of the   element’s target attribute Validates the contents of a field against a regular expression Specifies text that will be used as a placeholder in a form field Disables the validation performed on form elements by the browser Specifies that the field is required  Table 8-5 New Attributes for Forms Form Elements   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  225  The required Attribute  The required attribute tells the browser that the field must be  completed to submit the form. If it is left blank, the browser will bring attention to the error.  An example of this is shown here:   E-mail:        In supported browsers, leaving the field blank will cause an error that may be indicated once  you leave the field, on a submission attempt, or both. This is a handy way to ensure that a  necessary field does not get left blank in modern browsers. The pattern Attribute  The pattern attribute allows you to provide a regular expression that  must be matched by the entered data in order to be valid for submission. An example of this is  shown in the following code:   First Name:        By default, the field will be optional  so a blank field will pass , but when pattern is used in  tandem with the required attribute, the field will both be required and the data will have to match  your specified pattern. The following code gives the field a pattern and also makes it required:   First Name:        Thus, you can choose whether the pattern must be matched always, or whether the field is  optional and only needs to match the pattern when filled in.  The regular expression used as the pattern does have some differences from the way you   used them with JavaScript previously:   ● The ^ and $  to match the string from beginning to end  are automatically used, so the   pattern must be fully matched to pass validation.   ● The forward slashes      are not used to enclose the pattern; only the regular expression   characters are used.   ● Flags  such as i and g  cannot be used.  The first two differences are fairly straightforward. If you use pattern, you will need to make  sure your regular expression accounts for any additional allowed characters, since it will have  to be a complete match rather than a partial match. Leaving off the slashes is not a problem,  since they are just delimiters.  Being unable to use flags means that if you want the pattern to be case insensitive, you will  have to specify that within the regular expression rather than placing an i afterward. So, rather  than using  [a-z] i as the regular expression, you would specify the additional character range  of A–Z to allow for both lowercase and uppercase letters, as in the following code:      226  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Both the required and pattern attributes are quite helpful in browsers that support them. In   those that don’t, you can provide fallback validation using JavaScript jQuery  as you will do  later in this chapter  or simply send the data to the server-side program for validation. Providing Inline Hints With what you have learned so far, you are ready to create the example page that will be used  throughout the remainder of the chapter. This will be similar to the form you created earlier,  but will use some HTML5 code to provide initial validation in supported browsers.  Save the following HTML code as validation.html:  The special email input  type is used, as well as  the required attribute             Form Events          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }     .form-element { margin:0.8em 0; }     contact-form label { font-weight:bold; }     .err-msg { padding-left:12px; color:900; font-weight:bold; }                         Contact Us                   E-mail  required :                                           Name  optional :           <input type="text" id="name" class="fields" maxlength="20"            pattern="[A-Za-z ]{2,20}">                               Comments  required :           <textarea id="comments" class="fields" cols="25" rows="5"            maxlength="100" required>                                  The text area is required, and also must  have a maximum length of 100 characters  The text box is optional, but is  validated against a pattern if filled in   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  227  At this point, the only new thing to point out is the fact that HTML5 allows the maxlength  attribute to be set on   elements as well as text boxes. This allows you to have the  browser stop any further data from being entered in the field once the maximum length is  reached, and is used for the “Comments” field in this form.  You also already know how to use the focus   and blur   methods to display and remove  messages next to each form field. You will use this to provide users with helpful hints about  what is expected in each field as they enter the field. Save the following code as validation.js:  $ document .ready function   {   var $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,       $msgEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ,       $name = $ "name" ,        $msgName = $ "err-name" ;        $comments = $ "comments" ,        $msgComments = $ "err-comments" ,        $cForm = $ "contact-form" ;   $eMail.focus function   {         $msgEMail.empty  .append "Example: john@doe.com" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgEMail.empty  ;   } ;   $name.focus function   {         $msgName.empty  .append "Letters and spaces only" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgName.empty  ;   } ;   $comments.focus function   {         $msgComments.empty  .append "Enter up to 100 characters" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgComments.empty  ;   } ; } ;  This will add helpful hints each time the user focuses on a field, and remove each one when  the focus is removed. In addition to providing helpful information, this can assist the user in  knowing which form field is currently in focus to be filled in. The last variable declaration   $cForm  assigns the   element to $cForm to be used later for the submit event.  The calls to empty   prior to appending the message will help when you add the error   messages later, since you will want to clear  empty  those and show the hint again when the  user returns to the field.  Open the validate.html file in your browser and move into the various fields. Each one   should provide a helpful message to indicate what type of data should be entered. If you are  using a supported browser, it will also indicate when entered data is not valid. Figure 8-10  shows how the page looks when the “Name” field is given focus.   228  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 8-10 The hint for the “Name” field displays.  Validating the Form Now that you have your hints and HTML5 initial validation in place, you can perform a final  client-side validation of the data in the form before sending it to the server-side program.  Basically, you will perform the same checks as the HTML5 validation, which will work as  both a fallback and a way to provide any additional validation you may require before allowing  the submission to proceed.  First, you have the “E-mail” field, which is required. Validation of an e-mail address can be   done using a regular expression. Since the field is required, you can simply test the content of  the field for a match, as in the following code:  $cForm.submit function event  {   var emailPattern =  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$ i;       namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,   if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {        Show error message, etc.   } } ;  The regular expression pattern here is more in-depth than the validation used by the browser,  so it may catch some additional errors the browser did not. More information on this regular  expression and what it does can be found at www.regular-expressions.info email.html.  When an error occurs on the submission, this script is going to do several things:   ● Keep a count of errors and place a message at the top of the form if there is at least one   error   ● Clear any current “hint” messages next to the fields   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  229   ● Change the background color of any fields that have errors   ● Write a message next to the fields that have errors  To do this, you first need to add a variable to count the number of errors, which will be   increased by one each time an error is found. You will also add two variables to hold the  default field color and the color of fields when they contain errors. The submit   handler will  now look like this:  $cForm.submit function event  {   var emailPattern =  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$ I,        namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,       errors = 0,        fieldColor = "FFF",        errColor = "FDD";   if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {        Show error message, etc.   } } ;  These variables set the default field background  color  FFF  and the error background color  FDD   This variable will keep track of  the number of errors and is set to  zero when the form is submitted  Notice that errors is initialized to 0. This will happen each time the form is submitted. The  count will only go up if an error is found. You now need to make sure that both the default  background color is reset each time and that any current messages are cleared from the .err-msg   elements. This can be done by adding two lines of code, as follows:  $cForm.submit function event  {   var emailPattern =  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$ I,        namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,        errors = 0,        fieldColor = "FFF",        errColor = "FDD";   $ ".fields" .css "background-color", fieldColor ;   $ ".err-msg" .empty  ;   if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {        Show error message, etc.   } } ;  Sets the background color of all the  form fields to the default color  FFF   Empties all of the .err-msg   elements  With this in place, you can now work on the e-mail validation. Since you have the test in  place, you simply need to add the functionality. Here, if an error is found, you will change the  background color of the field to the error color, append an error message to its corresponding    element, and add 1 to the errors variable. This is done with the following code:  if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {   $eMail.css "background-color", errColor ;   $msgEMail.append "Required: Must be a valid e-mail address" ;   errors += 1; }   230  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  As you can see, if the validation is not passed, then the necessary elements are selected,  changes are made, and the errors variable is increased. Since you want nothing to happen if the  validation does pass, no else statement is used.  Finally, before the form is sent on to the server-side program, you want to check to make   sure no errors were encountered. If so, you want to write a message at the beginning of the  form and prevent the default action. This is done by adding the following code:  if  errors > 0  {   $cForm.prepend ' Please edit the marked fields ' +                   'below to fix errors. ' ;   event.preventDefault  ;  }  This places a message at the top of the form alerting the user to the fact that there are errors  and to update the marked fields. The submission to the server-side script is cancelled by using  event.preventDefault  .  When the submit handler code is all put together, it should look like the following:  Sets up the necessary variables  $cForm.submit function event  {   var emailPattern =  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$ i,       namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,        errors = 0,        fieldColor = "FFF",        errColor = "FDD";   $ ".fields" .css "background-color", fieldColor ;   $ ".err-msg" .empty  ;    if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {     $eMail.css "background-color", errColor ;     $msgEMail.append "Required: Must be a valid e-mail address" ;     errors += 1;   }   if  errors > 0  {     $cForm.prepend ' Please edit the marked fields ' +                     'below to fix errors. ' ;     event.preventDefault  ;    } } ;  If the validation is not passed, then an  error is created and indicated to the user  Resets field background  colors, clears messages  If there is at least one error, then a message is added to  the top of the form and the default action is prevented  With this done, there are two fields left to validate. The code shown for these fields will be   added immediately prior to the final if statement: if  errors > 0 .  The name field used a pattern for HTML5 validation, so that pattern will be used again    this is already placed in the namePattern variable in your code . Since it is an optional field,  you will only check the pattern if the length of the data in the field is at least one character.    Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  231  If there is an error, you will perform the same tasks as you did with the “E-mail” field. The  following code will be used for the name validation:  This keeps the field optional by only performing the  validation if there is at least one character in the field  if  $name.val  .length > 0  {   if  !namePattern.test $name.val     {     $name.css "background-color", errColor ;     $msgName.append "Must contain only letters and spaces - between " +                      "2 and 20 characters" ;      errors += 1;   } }  If the input does not pass validation, the background color of the field is  changed, a message is appended, and the errors variable is increased  Tests the name against the regular  expression pattern  This is very much like the E-mail field, except that the validation is wrapped within another if statement, which ensures that it is OK if the field is left blank, making the field optional.  Next, you want to validate the “Comments” text area. This is required, but cannot be more   than 100 characters. Thus, you need only check the length of the input, as in the following  code:  if   $comments.val  .length   100   {   $comments.css "background-color", errColor ;   $msgComments.append "Requried: Maximum 100 characters" ;   errors += 1; }  This ensures that the field has between 1 and 100 characters. If not, then the same procedure is  performed.  Finally, you can put all of the code together to finish up the JavaScript file. The final code   for the validate.js file should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   var $eMail = $ "e-mail" ,       $msgEMail = $ "err-e-mail" ,       $name = $ "name" ,        $msgName = $ "err-name" ;        $comments = $ "comments" ,        $msgComments = $ "err-comments" ;       $cForm = $ "contact-form" ;   $eMail.focus function   {         $msgEMail.empty  .append "Example: john@doe.com" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgEMail.empty  ;   } ;   $name.focus function   {         $msgName.empty  .append "Letters and spaces only" ;   } .blur function   {   232  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide          $msgName.empty  ;   } ;   $comments.focus function   {         $msgComments.empty  .append "Enter up to 100 characters" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgComments.empty  ;   } ;   $cForm.submit function event  {      var emailPattern =  ^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$ i,          namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,           errors = 0,           fieldColor = "FFF",           errColor = "FDD";     $ ".fields" .css "background-color", fieldColor ;     $ ".err-msg" .empty  ;      if  !emailPattern.test $eMail.val     {       $eMail.css "background-color", errColor ;       $msgEMail.append "Required: Must be a valid e-mail address" ;       errors += 1;     }     if  $name.val  .length > 0  {       if  !namePattern.test $name.val     {         $name.css "background-color", errColor ;         $msgName.append "Must contain only letters and spaces – between " +                          "2 and 20 characters" ;         errors += 1;       }     }     if   $comments.val  .length   100   {       $comments.css "background-color", errColor ;       $msgComments.append "Requried: Maximum 100 characters" ;       errors += 1;     }     if  errors > 0  {       $cForm.prepend ' Please edit the marked  fields ' +                       'below to fix errors. ' ;       event.preventDefault  ;      }   } ; } ;  Save the file and open validate.js in your browser. You should now have the form and  validation fully functioning, aside from an actual server-side program. Try out some different  types of input or different browsers to see how the validation is handled  whether it is done in  the browser via HTML5, done with jQuery, or sent to the server side with JavaScript off .   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  233  Try This 8-2  Practice Validation  pr08-02.html pr08-02.js  This project allows you to practice using the validation techniques learned in  this chapter. You will validate a form similar to the one you created  validate.js , except that it will use a different HTML5 input type  number  and won’t have a  “Comments” field.  Step by Step  1. Insert the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr08-02.html:               Project 8-2           body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }     .form-element { margin:0.8em 0; }     contact-form label { font-weight:bold; }     .err-msg { padding-left:12px; color:900; font-weight:bold; }                       Send a Number                   Name  optional :           <input type="text" id="name" class="fields" maxlength="20"            pattern="[A-Za-z ]{2,20}">                               Enter a Number  required :                                             2. Create a JavaScript file and save it as pr08-02.js. Add code that will add “hints” for each   field. For the “Name” field, the hint should say “Letters and spaces only.” For the “Enter a  Number” field, the hint should say “Digits 0-9 only.”   continued    234  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  3. Add code to work as a fallback for the HTML5 methods already used to validate the input.   If there are errors, place a message at the top of the form to alert the user. For each field,  add an error message beside it and change the background color of the field if there is an  error. For the “Name” field, the message should say “Must contain only letters and spaces— between 2 and 20 characters.” For the “Enter a Number” field, the message should say  “Required: Must contain only digits—between 0 and 9.”  4. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   var $name = $ "name" ,          $msgName = $ "err-name" ;          $num = $ "num" ,          $msgNum = $ "err-num" ;         $cForm = $ "contact-form" ;   $name.focus function   {         $msgName.empty  .append "Letters and spaces only" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgName.empty  ;   } ;   $num.focus function   {         $msgNum.empty  .append "Digits 0-9 only" ;   } .blur function   {         $msgNum.empty  ;   } ;   $cForm.submit function event  {      var namePattern =  ^[A-Za-z ]{2,20}$ ,             numPattern =  ^\d+$ ,             errors = 0,             fieldColor = "FFF",             errColor = "FDD";     $ ".fields" .css "background-color", fieldColor ;     $ ".err-msg" .empty  ;      if  $name.val  .length > 0  {       if  !namePattern.test $name.val     {         $name.css "background-color", errColor ;         $msgName.append "Must contain only letters and spaces – between" +                          "2 and 20 characters" ;         errors += 1;       }     }     if  !numPattern.test $num.val     {       $num.css "background-color", errColor ;       $msgNum.append "Required: Must contain only digits – between 0 and 9" ;       errors += 1;     }   Chapter 8:  The DOM and Forms  235      if  errors > 0  {       $cForm.prepend ' Please edit the marked fields' +                       'below to fix errors.

This   makes it easy to send information to the server or retrieve information from the server and do   so in a way that works across modern browsers.  Introduction to AJAX  The acronym AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. The term was used by  Jesse James Garrett in 2005 in his article “Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications”  www.adaptivepath.com ideas ajax-new-approach-web-applications . While the term originally  dealt with XML as the means of transferring data, it can now mean transferring data in any  form between the client and the server.  In modern JavaScript applications, you can request data from the server using the   XMLHttpRequest object. This allows you to send to or receive information from the server  without reloading the current page  asynchronously . Before this was possible, you had to send  the request to the server synchronously, wait for the response from the server, and load the new  information, requiring a page reload or a redirect to another page. When making calls to the  server asynchronously, you can do this behind the scenes without the need to reload the whole  page in the browser window. Instead, you can simply load the retrieved information into a  specified location on the current page when it arrives.  This chapter will discuss basic AJAX requests, two-way AJAX requests, and offer some  resources to further your study of AJAX security and server-side programming if you don’t  already have this knowledge.  Creating AJAX Requests  There are several methods available in jQuery for requesting information from the server.  Technically, you can request just about any type of text file: txt, html, xml, json, js, and  numerous other file types are possible. In this section, you will look at the most commonly  used file types  html, xml, and json  and how you can use different jQuery methods to obtain  the needed data.   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  241  First, you will need a document that needs some data from the server to get you started. This   HTML document will be used for the examples in this chapter. Save the following code as ajax.html:               AJAX          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }     our-products { margin:0 30% 0 0; }     .product { margin:1.2em 0em; }     .product-title { font-weight:bold; }                    Our Special Products   View Products          This document has some very basic styles applied to it, and contains an empty our-products   element.  You will also need a .js file, so save the following code as ajax.js:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {   } ; } ;  At this point, this just has an empty function to handle a click event on the “View Products”  link. The HTML and jQuery JavaScript code will be adjusted as you move through the  upcoming sections of the chapter. Retrieving HTML The easiest type of AJAX request to perform is one that loads an HTML file from the server.  The jQuery library provides the load   method for loading HTML content into a document. To  use it, you select an element in the current document where the retrieved content will be loaded  and provide the URL of the document containing the additional content to the load   method.  For example, to load the contents of my-file.html into an element with an id of my-element,  you could use the following code:  $ "my-element" .load "my-file.html" ;  This would load any HTML within my-file.html into my-element in the current document.   242  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  NOTE This load   method has the same name as the load   event-handling method. To keep  this from being problematic, jQuery determines which of the methods is being called  based on the arguments that are sent to it.  To make use of this with your current example document  ajax.html , you will need to   create an additional HTML document that has the content that will be added to ajax.html. So,  save the following code as more-content.html:       Super Programmer Robot 3000     Price: $1,635,343.99          Need code written in a hurry? No time to hire a human programmer?

Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  243  Figure 9-1 The initial page  One thing you will notice here: This is not a complete HTML file with the doctype, head  section, and so on included. Instead, you have a snippet of HTML code specifically for the  purpose of providing content to the our-products element in the main HTML document  you  will see how to access content within complete HTML documents later in this section .  With this HTML snippet file available, you can simply plug it into the load   method to   add its content to the ajax.html document. Make the following changes to your ajax.js file and  save it:  Prevents the link from performing its default action  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "our-products" .load "more-content.html" ;   } ; } ;  Loads the content from more-content.html into the  our-products element in the ajax.html document  Load the ajax.html file in your browser and click the “View Products” link. The content will be  loaded into the page once you click the button! Figure 9-1 shows the initial page, and Figure 9-2  shows the page once the “View Products” link is clicked.  Loading a Portion of a Complete HTML Document Sometimes the HTML you will need won’t be in a handy snippet file. You may need to get  content from a complete HTML document. This means that the other document will have its  own doctype, head section, body tags, and possibly other elements that are not needed in the  document where you will use the content.  Fortunately, jQuery makes it possible to select a portion of the document using its selector  syntax as part of the argument to the load   method. As an example, suppose the more-content .html file contained the following code rather than an HTML snippet:         Lines of code that aren’t needed in the other document!   244  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 9-2 The page after the link is clicked  Lines of code that aren’t needed in the other document!

We   currently have a limited supply so act today!         More...             Lines of code that aren’t needed in the other document!  While the needed code is here, there is also a bit of extra content that you don’t need: the   ,  , and   elements; the opening and closing   tags; and the  additional   and   elements. Instead, you just want all of the .product elements to be  loaded.  You can do this by placing a space after the URL of the document you are retrieving,   followed by a jQuery selector. For example, the following code would get all of the .product elements from more-content.html:  $ "our-products" .load "more-content.html .product" ;  With this, you can now update ajax.js to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "our-products" .empty  .load "more-content.html .product" ;   } ; } ;   246  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Note that the empty   method is now added to prevent the loaded document from displaying  more than once if the link is clicked more than once. Open ajax.html in your browser and click  the “View Products” link. You should get the same result as before, with the product content  being displayed once the link is clicked. Using Animation and the Callback Function When loading the content, you may wish to use one of the animation effects, such as  slideDown  . At first, this would seem fairly easy to do by simply adding it to the chain, as in  the following code:  $ "our-products" .empty  .load "more-content.html .product"  .slideDown 2000 ;  Replacing the load   call in ajax.js with this line will not appear to make any difference! The  content will simply appear once it loads, with no sliding. So why doesn’t this work?  The first issue is that the content being loaded is already visible, so slideDown   won’t   reshow it. This is easy enough to fix by adding hide   to the chain before calling load   so that  the content that is loaded within our-products will be hidden before loading, then displayed  afterward by using slideDown  . Thus, the following code could be used instead:  $ "our-products" .empty  .hide     .load "more-content.html .product" .slideDown 2000 ;  Trying this out, unfortunately, doesn’t change things much, except to potentially add an extra  delay before the content is displayed. Why is this?  AJAX methods load content asynchronously. This means that the typical order of   execution for your statements may be altered. Most jQuery JavaScript code runs  synchronously. In other words, each task is run only after the previous task has completed.  There is a strict order that is maintained so that no unexpected tasks are completed before  their turn in the order.  With an asynchronous request, the asynchronous task is started, but the script immediately  returns to the next task at hand rather than waiting for the asynchronous task to be completed.  The asynchronous task will at some later time receive a response from the server and be  executed.  What this means for the last code listing is that the hide   method will execute, and  the load   method will begin execution  but may be waiting for a response . While the  load   method waits for a response, the script execution is immediately handed back to the  next task, which is to execute the slideDown   method. Thus, even though you might not  have the content loaded yet, slideDown   is executed right away. Since this particular call  uses a duration of two seconds, nothing else can be done until that time elapses. Once it is  complete, the asynchronous task can then be completed if it has received a response and can  load the data.   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  247  Given that you are working locally at this time, you will likely have the data load   immediately after the two-second delay. If there were any additional lag time, the request  might not complete until a longer wait  or until even more synchronous tasks are completed .  To keep this from happening, you can use a callback function to be executed once the  asynchronous load   method has completed its task. This is done by adding the callback  function as an argument to the load   method, as in the following code  save these changes to  your ajax.js file :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $ "our-products" .empty  .hide         .load "more-content.html .product", function   {       $ this .slideDown 2000 ;     } ;   } ; } ;  This executes only after the load   method has completed its task  The second argument  is a callback function  Reload the ajax.html file in your browser and click the “View Products” link. This time, the  new content should slide down as expected once it is loaded. Figure 9-3 shows the slide-down  in progress after the link is clicked.  Figure 9-3 The slide-down now works as expected.   248  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Retrieving XML Another type of document you can retrieve is one in XML format. To retrieve the data, you can  use the $.get   method, which sends back the text of the document in most cases. However, if  a response is received from the server that the document’s MIME type is XML, its callback  function will receive the XML DOM tree.  Using an XML Document To work with this method, you will first need an XML document. The following code shows  how the same data you were retrieving via an HTML document could be represented in an  XML document  save this file as more-content.xml :               Super Programmer Robot 3000       Price: $1,635,343.99            Need code written in a hurry?

Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  249      We currently have a limited supply so act today!            product-03.html         As you can see, the XML document simply describes the content, rather than providing HTML  code. With an XML file, you will need to retrieve the document structure and build the HTML  code from the structure and data contained in the XML file.  The $.get   method is a global jQuery method—it is not tied to a jQuery object  such as a  selection of elements  like most methods you have used. Instead, you simply call the method  to get the information, then use it in the document where needed  using append  , prepend  , and so on . First, you will need to get the data, so you will need to call the method. Since  this document is XML, you will use the callback function to obtain the DOM structure of the  document, which you can then easily traverse using jQuery, as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.get "more-content.xml", function dom  {        var phtml = '';          Traverse XML DOM and build HTML code...     } ;   } ; } ;  The first argument specifies the URL of the file to retrieve. The second argument is the  callback function, which executes when the response has been received and the DOM  information has been loaded. This information is stored in the argument used in the  callback function, which can use any name you wish  dom is used in this case . The phtml variable will be used to build and store the HTML that will be used to fill in the product  information.  You now need a way to traverse the XML DOM structure and build your HTML code from   it. For this purpose, the jQuery find   method will be most helpful. The find   Method The jQuery find   method allows you to search all descendant elements of the specified  element and select any needed elements using a second selector as the argument. For example,  to find all of the   elements in the XML document, you can use the dom object  obtained from the XML file and select any   elements within it using the following  code:  $ dom .find 'product'    250  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  A variable is defined to hold the  HTML content that will be built  You can now use the jQuery methods you already know to work with those elements.   In this case, the selection includes all of the   elements in the XML document, so  you can use each   to cycle through each of the   elements and build your HTML  from their content, as in the following code  update your ajax.js file to use this code and  save it : The XML document is retrieved and the callback  function is used to obtain the DOM structure  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.get "more-content.xml", function dom  {       var phtml = '';         $ dom .find 'product' .each function   {           var $prod = $ this ;            phtml += ' ';           phtml += ' ';            phtml += $prod.find 'title' .text   + ' ';           phtml += ' ';           phtml += $prod.find 'price' .text   + ' ';           phtml += ' ';           phtml += $prod.find 'description' .text   + ' ';           phtml += ' ';           phtml += ' More             ';           phtml += ' ';         } ;         $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append phtml .         slideDown 2000 ;       } ;   } ; } ;  The final HTML code  after all of the each   iterations are executed  is appended to the our- products element and is shown using slideDown    $ this , which is the current    element, is assigned  to a variable, $prod, for reuse  The product   is closed  The URL is used to build a link to more information on the product  The same process is used to fill in the price and description content  The text of the   element from the XML DOM is used as the  content of the   element; the   element is closed  The   element is created to hold the product title  Since you have the   element selected,  create the corresponding   element HTML  The   elements are selected and each   is used to run code for each of the    elements   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  251  Notice how find   is used throughout the code to select the necessary elements and how  their content can be retrieved using text  . The DOM structure and content within the  XML document is used to build the corresponding HTML that will be inserted into the  ajax.html document.  After the last iteration of each  , the content is appended and shown using slideDown  .  Notice that simply adding slideDown   to the chain works here, since you are already within  the callback function of the asynchronous request from $.get  .  Reload the ajax.html file in your browser and click the “View Products” link. This  should work exactly as it did before, but now is using an XML document to obtain its  necessary data.  Retrieving JSON Another popular file from which you can obtain data is a json file. JSON  JavaScript Object  Notation  was developed by Douglas Crockford as a means to transport data easily among  the different applications that may need it. JSON formats data in such a way that everything  is described as an object  map  or array. A map can have properties  which can be values or  further maps arrays , and arrays can contain items  which can also be values or further maps  arrays . This formatting allows JSON data to be used easily by numerous applications. In fact,  most languages have some type of JSON parser available so that JSON data can be either  retrieved or sent out as needed.  An example of JSON-formatted data is shown here:  {   "name": "John",    "schedule": { "M-F": "Work", "Weekend": "Sleep" },    "foods": ["pizza", "burger", "salad"] }  As you can see, there is a root object  you could also use an array here , which contains three  name value pairs. Each value can, in turn, be another object or array if needed, as “schedule”  and “foods” demonstrate here. One more thing that you should notice: When creating JSON  data, the names of any object properties must be within quote marks, where in JavaScript, this  is optional for simple names.  To load JSON data, jQuery has another global method named $.getJSON  , where you can   pass the file to load and the callback function as arguments. For example, the following code  could be used to get the data from a file named more-content.json:  $.getJSON "more-content.json", function data  {      Statements... } ;   252  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  The data argument will contain the JSON data to be parsed, which can be done using the  global version of each, which is $.each  . Instead of working on a selection, $.each   can  be passed an object or an array as the first argument and a callback function as the second  argument. This callback function can use two arguments: current iteration index  0, 1, 2, and  so on  and the current item or property from the array or map. For your example, you can use  the current item property to easily obtain its value.  First, you will need your data in JSON format. The following code shows how  the same data you have been using could be represented in JSON  save the file as  more-content.json :  [   {     "title": "Super Programmer Robot 3000",      "price": "Price: $1,635,343.99",      "desc": "Need code written in a hurry?

Also, your Web server needs  to have .json  application.json  configured in the server MIME types in order for JSON  files to be properly parsed.  With the JSON file in place, you can now update your ajax.js file to make use of it. Update   your ajax.js code to the following and save the file:  The $.getJSON   method is called  to read the JSON file and execute  the callback function  Variable to store and build the HTML code  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.getJSON "more-content.json", function data  {       var phtml = '';         $.each data, function index, prod  {            phtml += ' ';           phtml += ' ' + prod.title +            ' ';           phtml += ' ' + prod.price +            ' ';           phtml += ' ' + prod.desc +            ' ';           phtml += ' ';           phtml += ' More  ';           phtml += ' ';         } ;         $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append phtml         .slideDown 2000 ;       } ;   } ; } ;  The finished HTML is appended to the our-products element as you have been doing previously  Each time through $.each  , prod contains the current  object from the JSON file; you can then grab the  values using the properties of the object  The $.each   method iterates over the array, with each  object being sent as the prod argument  Notice how $.each   works well with the JSON data. The JSON file contains an array of  objects, each of which contains property value pairs. The prod argument contains the object  array of the current iteration. In this case, you are iterating over an array of objects, so the prod argument will represent each object in the array. You can then use each object’s property names  to access the corresponding values, just as you would with a typical JavaScript object  refer  back to Chapter 5 if needed . In the end, the same effect is achieved, with the content being  loaded and displayed with a slide-down effect after the link is clicked.   254  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This 9-1  Practice Basic AJAX  This project allows you to practice a simple AJAX request by using the  load   method to load some HTML code from another page. You will need  to be sure to request only the code you need from the other HTML page.  pr09-01.html pr09-01-jp.html pr09-01-kd.html pr09-01.js  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr09-01.html:               Site Authors          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; width:50%; }                    Authors   John Pollock   View Details      Kool Dude   View Details          2. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr09-01-jp.html:               Bio - John Pollock       John Pollock        Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  255  3. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr09-01-kd.html:  John Pollock has written a book on JavaScript and one   on jQuery. He also runs a Web site where he writes   articles on Web development. He is also an odd   character, so we let him write some stuff here, too.     You can contact him on his site  which I can't find    in a search right now  or on Twitter  he says he has    one but he must not have any followers because I can't    find it . Just keep searching until you find him.                       Bio - Kool Dude       Kool Dude      Kool Dude is one enigmatic character. I don't know if   he actually exists or is someone's alter ego on this   Web development forum I visit. Something tells me he   is actually just a real person like you and me, though.     I can't find any real contact information for him. The    site he lists in his forum profile doesn't work and    his e-mail address bounces. He could be on a social    network but I just can't find his profile...          4. Notice how both “bio” pages have a   element with an id of bio. In the pr09-01.js file, add jQuery JavaScript code that will load the appropriate bio information from the  corresponding HTML file when the “View Details” link is clicked for that person.   continued    256  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  5. Save the file as pr09-01.js. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   var $dJP = $ "details-jp" ,        $dKD = $ "details-kd" ;   $ "author-jp" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $dJP.empty  .hide  .load "pr09-01-jp.html bio", function data  {       $dJP.slideDown 1000 ;     } ;   } ;   $ "author-kd" .click function event  {   event.preventDefault  ;    $dKD.empty  .hide  .load "pr09-01-kd.html bio", function data  {      $dKD.slideDown 1000 ;     } ;   } ; } ;  6. Open the pr09-01.html file in your Web browser. Click each link to view the details about   the chosen author, which will be loaded from a separate HTML file.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of the AJAX load   method to load information from  outside HTML files. Depending on the link that was clicked, a different HTML file was used  to obtain the necessary data to display on the page.  Two-Way AJAX Requests  In addition to simply loading data from a file, jQuery provides AJAX methods that allow you to  also send data to be processed by an application on the server. In this way, you can provide an  even more interactive experience that gathers information based on user decisions or user input.  Using Get and Post Requests The jQuery library provides the global $.get and $.post methods. These can be used to pass  information to an application on the server, which can then return data to your application on  the client side.  For these examples, you will be adding a PHP file to the project you have been working  on in this chapter. This file will take data from your AJAX request and send data back to you  based on the data you sent. While this book will use a simple PHP script, the same tasks can be  performed by any server-side language  Ruby, Python, ASP.NET, Java, and so on . Since this  book is about using jQuery on the client side, the PHP script will be discussed according to    Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  257  concepts more than the specifics of the code. Resources for learning server-side programming  languages will be provided at the end of the chapter. Using Get The $.get   method can be used to send and receive data. The general format is shown in the  following code:  $.get url, map, function data, status, jqXHR  {      function code... }, type ;  Up to four arguments can be used as needed. These include  as seen in the previous code :  ●  url The URL of the file to get  ● map An object of property value pairs that can be sent to the server application  ●  function data, status, jqXHR  The callback function that executes on success ●  data The data returned from the server application ●  status The text of the status response ●   jqXHR The jQuery XHR object  ●   type The type of data expected from the server  The url argument is required, where the others are optional. If nothing is used for type, jQuery  will try to determine the data type of the requested file.  An example of $.get   is shown in the following code:  $.get 'app.php', { num: 1 }, function data  {      Function code } ;  This will get the url app.php and will send it an object map that includes the property num with a value of 1. When the request has been completed successfully, the callback function is  executed and can make use of any data that has been returned using the data variable.  As a more complete example, you will update the ajax.html file you have been using. This   update will move the CSS code to an external style sheet so that it can be used for multiple  files. This is shown in the following code  save as ajax.html :               AJAX                 The CSS code is moved to an external  style sheet named ajax.css   258  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide       Our Special Products   View Products          The link is altered so that it calls a PHP script rather  than a static HTML file when JavaScript is unavailable  You will now create the external CSS file. Place the following code into a new file and   save it as ajax.css:  body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; } our-products { margin:0 30% 0 0; } .product { margin:1.2em 0em; } .product-title { font-weight:bold; }  This is the same code used within the    tags previously.  The idea behind the example script will be to load the title of each product  Super   Programmer Robot 3000, Web Programmer Robot 2000, and so on  when the “View Products”  link is clicked and make each title a link that will display the details about the product when  clicked.  This will use two different AJAX requests, both of which will request return data from   a PHP script. Depending on the data sent to the PHP script from the $.get   method, the  PHP script will return either a list of linked product titles or the product details for a single  product.  To ensure the user can obtain the data once the “View Products” link is clicked, the  PHP script will also check to see whether the request was made as an AJAX request or  not. If not, then the product titles and data will simply be displayed as you have done  previously.  The PHP file will simply be a concept file. You’ll see notes pointing to different parts   of the PHP code to describe what is being done. You will then see how this affects the  jQuery code you need to write to make the necessary requests and work with the returned  data.  NOTE To run the code as it is, you will need a server with PHP and MySQL installed  the  product data also needs to be entered into a MySQL database named “products”  within a table named “special” . If you have another configuration  a different  programming language or database type , you can code the same concept file  in the alternate language and or adjust the database portions of the code to suit  your setup.   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  259  The code for the PHP file you will use is shown here  save as view-products.php :  <?php require_once "config.php" ;    defines $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass $dbname='products'; $conn = new mysqli $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass, $dbname  or              die  'Error connecting to mysql' ; if  mysqli_connect_error    {     die 'Connect Error  ' . mysqli_connect_errno   .

'  ';         $html .= '  ';         $html .= ' ';     }   }   elseif   isset $_GET['prod']   &&  !isset $_GET['page']    {     $prod = mysqli_real_escape_string $conn, trim $_GET['prod']  ;       $psql = "SELECT * FROM special WHERE title='" . $prod .

In summary, it  performs one of four general actions, based on the type of request and the information sent  to it:   ● Simply display a page with all of the data if the request is not an AJAX request  for   example, if the user has JavaScript disabled    ● Return a list of products in HTML format  where each title can be clicked to display   further details    ● Return the details of a single product in HTML format   ● Return nothing for the HTML if the request is made improperly  does not contain either   the page or prod properties, and only one of those properties at a time   The PHP program does the major work here: It makes the application accessible for those  without JavaScript and returns the relevant data to allow you to enhance the application via  jQuery JavaScript for those that have it enabled. Since the data has been placed into a database  for this application, the PHP program also does the work of connecting to and retrieving  information from the database.   262  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  NOTE This PHP program is used here to present the concept, but should only be used in a test  environment. It should not be used in a production environment where you will need to  double-check application and data security, among other needs.  The task now is to use jQuery and its $.get   method to put this PHP program to use and  create an application that responds to the various elements that can be clicked by the user to  request further information.  First, you need to determine how a click on the “View Products” link will be handled. In  this case, you want to retrieve the list of clickable links. Since the PHP script checks for the  existence of the page to return the links, you can use the $.get   method to send the program  what it needs. Consider the following code  save this as the new code for your ajax.js file :  The click   method is used on the  “View Products” link  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.get 'view-products.php', { page: 1 }, function products  {       $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append products .       slideDown 'slow' ;     } ;   } ; } ;  Since the returned data stored in products is HTML  code, this simply appends it to the our-products element as you have done with HTML code previously  The $.get   method is used—the view-products.php file is executed,  the page property with a value of 1 is sent to the server-side  application, and any data returned from the PHP application is  sent to the callback function using a variable named products  The default action of the link is prevented  This handles the first click to view the product list. It sends the PHP program the page property  as part of the get request, which you will recall is used by the PHP program to determine that  the list of product links should be returned  rather than the details of a single product, which  happens when you send it the prod property . Figure 9-4 shows how the ajax.html page looks  after the “View Products” link is clicked.  The next task is to react any time one of the product links is clicked. The details of   the product need to be loaded and shown to the user. The first issue is that you will need  to access elements that were not a part of the DOM when the page loaded. You will recall  from Chapter 3 that the on   method allows you to use event delegation, allowing you  to attach an event handler to a parent element, which can then target the specific child  element later.   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  263  Figure 9-4 The products are displayed as a list of clickable links.  In this case, the our-products element was already in place when the document loaded,   and the   elements with the .product-title class were loaded after the “View Products”  link was clicked. Thus, we can use on   to delegate the event and allow clicks on any    elements with the .product-title class to work once they are a part of the DOM, as in the  following code:  $ "our-products" .on "click", "div.product-title", function event  {      Function code... } ;  With this in place, you now need to see whether the container element  .product-details  for all of the elements containing details exists. This will accomplish a particular goal here:  to determine whether the data is already in the DOM and can simply be shown hidden, or  whether the data needs to be loaded into the DOM via an AJAX request.  To accomplish this, you will need to search for a   element with the .product-details   class within the current .product   element. This can be done using the find   method. The  following code illustrates what you will be doing:  A variable is created for the current .product  ; $ this  points to  .product-title, so you can use its parent element to execute the find   method  $ "our-products" .on "click", "div.product-title", function event  {   var $prodDiv = $ this .parent  ,       $prodDetails = $prodDiv.find ".product-details"    event.preventDefault  ;  The default action  following the link  is prevented  The .product-details   is assigned to $prodDetails if it exists; otherwise, an empty object will be assigned to it   264  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide    if $prodDetails.text  .length > 0  {        Show or hide the element since it has already been loaded   }   else {        Get the data, load it into the DOM, and show it   } } ;  If the element is not found, $prodDetails will have a length  of zero  empty object , so you will need to load the data  If the .prod-details element is found, the length property  of $prodDetails will be greater than zero, so you can  simply show hide the element  As you can see, with jQuery’s selectors and the find   method, you can locate the .prod-details element if it exists. Assigning the result of the selection to a variable  $prodDetails  gives you  a way to determine if the element is there: If so, the object will have a length of 1 or more;  otherwise, the length will be 0.  With this information, you can handle the click in a different way when the .prod-  details   is present. If it exists, you will simply show or hide the data that has been  loaded. If it does not exist, then you need to obtain the data with $.get   and load it into  the DOM.  So, if you want to use a slide animation, you can use slideToggle   when the   element is present. If not, you can load the data and then use slideDown  , as in the  following code:  With the data already loaded, you can simply  toggle between sliding down and sliding up  $ "our-products" .on "click", "div.product-title", function event  {   var $prodDiv = $ this .parent  ,       $prodDetails = $prodDiv.find ".product-details"    event.preventDefault  ;   if $prodDetails.text  .length > 0  {     $prodDetails.slideToggle 'slow' ;   }   else {    $.get 'view-products.php', { prod: $ this .text   }, function p  {      $prodDetails.hide  .append p .slideDown 'slow' ;    } ;   } } ;  Once the data is retrieved, it can be  appended and shown via slideDown    The request sends the prod property with the value of the text  in the .prod-title  ; this prompts the PHP script to locate the  corresponding product in the database, obtain its details, and  send them back with HTML markup   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  265  As you can see, slideToggle   is used when the element is present, while $get   is used to  obtain the information and add it to the document if not. Notice that the PHP program is sent  the property prod with a value of $ this .text   from $.get  . $ this .text refers to the text within  the element .prod-title element, which means that the product title is sent. This allows the PHP  program to check the database for the product title and return the product details for that title. With that taken care of, you can now complete the ajax.js file. Use the following code for   ajax.js and save the file:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.get 'view-products.php', { page: 1 }, function products  {       $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append products .       slideDown 'slow' ;     } ;   } ;   $ "our-products" .on "click", "div.product-title", function event  {       var $prodDiv = $ this .parent  ,           $prodDetails = $prodDiv.find ".product-details"        event.preventDefault  ;       if $prodDetails.text  .length > 0  {         $prodDetails.slideToggle 'slow' ;       }       else {         $.get 'view-products.php', { prod: $ this .text   },          function p  {         $prodDetails.hide  .append p .slideDown 'slow' ;       } ;     }   } ; } ;  If you are able to use this example in a test server environment, you can load the ajax.html page and go through the process. Click the “View Products” link to get the list of products,  then click a product title to view hide its details. Figure 9-5 shows the result of clicking the  “Web Programmer Robot 2000” link. Using Post The $.post   method works the same way as get, but sends the data via a post request rather  than get. The biggest difference here is that a post request can transport more data than a get  request.  For example, to call the first request from the previous example using $.post   rather than   $.get  , you would simply swap out the method name, as in the following code:  $.post 'view-products.php', { page: 1 }, function products  {   $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append products .   266  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 9-5 The details are displayed when the link is clicked.    slideDown 'slow' ; } ;  The PHP program would then need to be updated accordingly to look for $_POST information  rather than $_GET. If your application is transmitting large amounts of data, $.post   may be a  better option for you.  Handling Errors Sometimes when gathering information from the server, things do not go as planned. Perhaps  the file you are trying to access doesn’t get loaded due to a network error or a slow connection.  In such cases, it is good to be able to handle the error in some way so that the user knows that  something went wrong.  For any AJAX function other than load  , you can chain the error   function to it in order   to handle errors with an AJAX request. For example, consider the following code:  $.get 'my-script.php', function products  {      Show loaded information } .error function   {   $ "my-element" .empty  .append "Load Error!" ; } ;   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  267  Here, the error   method is chained to the $.get   method. In this way, a function can be  executed to alert the user to the error.  In your ajax.js file, you can now use this to provide a quick error message to users if an   AJAX request fails for some reason. This example will simply display some text, but you could  do any number of things  provide a “try again” link or other helpful information, for instance .  Save the new code, shown here, in your ajax.js file:  An error message for  the product list request  $ document .ready function   {   $ "view-products" .click function event  {     event.preventDefault  ;     $.get 'view-products.php', { page: 1 }, function products  {       $ "our-products" .empty  .hide  .append products .       slideDown 'slow' ;     } .error function   {       $ "our-products" .empty  .append "Load Error!" ;     } ;   } ;   $ "our-products" .on "click", "div.product-title", function event  {       var $prodDiv = $ this .parent  ,           $prodDetails = $prodDiv.find ".product-details"        event.preventDefault  ;       if $prodDetails.text  .length > 0  {       $prodDetails.slideToggle 'slow' ;     }     else {       $.get 'view-products.php', { prod: $ this .text   }, function p  {         $prodDetails.hide  .append p .slideDown 'slow' ;       } .error function   {         $prodDiv.after "Load Error!" ;        } ;     }   } ; } ;  An error message for the  product details request  To see the error work, you may need to manually create one by altering the name of  the requested file in the code to one that doesn’t exist  creates a 404 error . So, instead  of “view-products.php,” you might use “not-here.php” or anything else so that an error  will occur. Figure 9-6 shows the page when there is an error after clicking the “View  Products” link.   268  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 9-6 Oops! The content was not loaded!  Form Input Serialization The jQuery library offers a helpful method named serialize   for sending form input data to  the server, which allows you to submit the form behind the scenes, avoiding the typical page  reload or redirect for the user once a form is submitted.  You can serialize individual input fields, but most likely you will want to send all the form input   to the server. By selecting the form and using serialize  , this can be done easily using jQuery.  As an example, suppose you have a contact form that allows users to send you   a message. Rather than redirecting the users back to the same page or a new one for  confirmation, you would like to simply display a message on the page once the submission  is complete. Using serialize  , you can submit the form data and then use $.get   or $.post   to send the serialized data to an application. In the callback function that executes on the  completion of the request, you can insert a message letting the user know the message was  sent successfully.  First, you will need a page with an HTML form. Save the following code as form-ajax.  html:               Form AJAX                   Contact Us           Name:                E-mail:     Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  269               Message:                                        This sets up a simple form with three input fields. The name attribute is used with all of  the fields. This is because serialize   will only include input fields that have the name  attribute  used by server-side scripts to collect form data . Also, only fields that contain  input are sent as part of the serialized string to the server. Thus, empty text boxes,  unchecked radio buttons, and so on will not be included. You can use form validation   refer back to Chapter 8  to ensure that the fields you require data from have been  completed.  To avoid another long PHP code example, assume that the server-side PHP program that   handles the form  form-sub.php  can perform the following tasks:   ● Redirect the user to a completion error message if it is not an AJAX request JavaScript is   disabled   ● Return a “success” message if the information was successfully submitted  The details on how to accomplish these tasks are handled by the server-side program, so you  need only work on the client-side task of making sure the information is sent to it.  Using serialize   and $.post  , the following code submits the form data behind the scenes  with an AJAX request and simply appends a message to the page when complete  save the file  as form-ajax.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "contact-form" .submit function event  {     var formInput = $ this .serialize  ;     event.preventDefault  ;     $.post "form-sub.php", formInput, function data  {       $ "sub-msg" .empty  .append "Message sent successfully." ;      } .error function   {       $ "sub-msg" .empty  .append "Load Error!" ;     } ;   } ; } ;  Once the request is complete, the message  is displayed on the page by appending it  The form data is serialized  As you can see, the form is selected and submit   is used to handle the form when it is   submitted. By using the form itself as the selection for serialize  , each form input field that is   The serialized data is sent to the server for processing   270  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  filled in will be sent as part of a formatted string to the server. For example, entering “blah” in  all three fields will send the following string to the server:  name=blah&email=blah&msg=blah  This works the same way as if it had been submitted via a regular get or post request to the  server, and the server-side program can handle the data in its usual syntax.  Since the data returned is not being used, all that displays upon completion is the message,   “Message sent successfully.” You could also choose to return a message, the input data, or  other items from the server-side program, depending on your needs. Figure 9-7 shows the  initial page, and Figure 9-8 shows how the page would look with a server-side program  returning a completed request, which displays the success message.  Figure 9-7 The initial page  Figure 9-8 The page after successful submission   Chapter 9: Working with AJAX  271  Try This 9-2  Practice Serialization  pr09-02.html pr09-02.js pr09-02.php  This project allows you to practice using the serialize   method to serialize  form input. You will create a form that submits without reloading the page,  like the example in this chapter. Upon completion, a success message will be  displayed.  Step by Step  1. Insert the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr09-02.html:               Project 9-2                  Contact Us           Name:                E-mail:                Message:                                        2. Next, you will create an empty PHP file. This will allow the script to succeed if you are not   able to work with a server  if you are able to use a server, you can adjust the program and  or language and write some code to return information if desired . Insert the following PHP  code in your editor and save the file as pr09-02.php:     3. Create a JavaScript file and save it as pr09-02.js. Add jQuery JavaScript code so that the  form input is serialized and used as part of a post request using the $.post   method. If the    continued    272  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  request is successful, send a success message with the text “Message sent successfully.” If  there is an error, send the message “Load Error!”  4. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "contact-form" .submit function event  {     var formInput = $ this .serialize  ;     event.preventDefault  ;     $.post "pr09-02.php", formInput, function data  {       $ "sub-msg" .empty  .append "Message sent successfully." ;      } .error function   {       $ "sub-msg" .empty  .append "Load Error!" ;     } ;;   } ; } ;  5. Open the pr09-02.html file in your Web browser. Fill in some form fields and submit the   form to see the success message.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of the $.post   method and the serialize   method in order to serialize and submit form information behind the scenes without  reloading the page. Once this process was complete, a success message was displayed  for the user.  Security Issues and Further Information  Due to the risk of cross-site scripting and other potential attacks, AJAX requests must request  files on the same server. This helps to prevent malicious code from running, or from another  site changing the code from something helpful to something malicious.  If you do have a trusted source, however, there are some methods being drafted for   allowing requests from another server, such as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  CORS . You  can read more about this at www.w3.org TR cors .  When dealing with data sent to and from the server, it is often possible for users to input  information of their own in some way. Form elements provide an easy way for users to input  information, but get and post requests can also be sent information  the user simply needs to  know the name of the file you are requesting, for example, view-products.php . Rather than  running the program from your intended action, users could, for instance, type their own URLs  for get requests to see if malicious code could be run.  It is best to always test user input before running a database query or displaying it on   a Web page. Some resources for this, as well as for learning some common server-side  languages, are provided next.

A: Yes, jQuery offers the $.ajax   method, which allows you to create a customized AJAX  request if you need to do so. It offers you the ability to supply a multitude of arguments  that alter how the request operates. To find out more about the $.ajax   method, visit the  jQuery site at http:  api.jquery.com jQuery.ajax .  Q: So the data sent or received doesn’t need to be in XML format? A: No, the data can be in any text format you need to use. You can send a string of text, text in   JSON format, XML, HTML, or in various other formats.  Q: Can AJAX be done via JavaScript instead? A: Yes, using the XMLHttpRequest object, you can create AJAX requests in JavaScript.

Chapter 10  Using Plugins  277   278  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Key Skills & Concepts  ●  Introduction to jQuery Plugins           ● Using a Plugin  ● Helpful Plugins  The jQuery library supports the addition of plugins, which can further extend the capabilities   of the scripts you write. In this chapter, you will learn what jQuery plugins are, how to make  use of them, and get a quick overview of some plugins that you may find useful in developing  your scripts and applications.  Introduction to jQuery Plugins  Up to this point, you have been using the core components of the jQuery library, which have  allowed you to perform numerous tasks with ease and cross-browser compatibility. While the  jQuery library by itself is very helpful, you may find occasions where you need additional  functionality or features that are not part of the core library.  To assist with this, jQuery allows developers to create methods that can extend the jQuery   library to provide additional features, which are called plugins. By simply adding another  JavaScript file and calling a new method, you can use a plugin to harness the extra features it  brings to the table.  The jQuery site houses numerous plugins at http:  plugins.jquery.com . The site displays   helpful information for each plugin, such as the version number, the home page for the plugin,  bug reports, and more. Some information, such as the number of “watchers,” can be helpful to  see if the plugin is a popular one.  You can also search for plugins on the Web via Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or other   search engines. Needless to say, there are numerous plugins available all over the Web. This  means that you will need to be mindful when choosing a plugin for use to ensure that it does  what you need it to do and is still supported and or bug-free. Many have documentation on  the author’s Web site or on GitHub, a popular code repository  http:  github.com . If you are  in doubt, you can always visit the jQuery forums to ask other users and developers for help  or recommendations. The forum is at http:  forum.jquery.com  shows all categories . Plugin- specific questions can be posted in the “Using jQuery Plugins” category at http:  forum.jquery .com using-jquery-plugins .  Using a Plugin  Using a plugin is typically an easy process of including the new files and calling a new method  within your script. Some plugins require just an extra JavaScript file, while others will also    Chapter 10: Using Plugins  279  Ask the Expert Q: Will using plugins slow down my site? A: Many plugins are optimized as much as possible in order to keep the additional code and  overhead to a minimum. Depending on the plugin you choose, you could potentially add a  large codebase to what you are already using, thus creating longer download times. When  choosing plugins, you will want to be sure that each one does what you need without  containing too many additional features that you don’t plan to use.  Q: So does this mean I shouldn’t use plugins? A: Not at all. Many plugins provide very helpful features with a minimum of additional   overhead. You may also need a lot of features, in which case a larger plugin may be what  you need. What you do will largely depend on your needs and the needs of your users.  Q: What if I can’t find what I need? Can I create my own plugins? A: Yes! Chapter 11 will introduce plugin development and provide additional resources for  you if you wish to pursue this. There are certainly cases where a custom plugin can be  helpful. For example, you may have a need that is not currently addressed, or you may need  a single feature but can only find plugins that include that feature with numerous others you  do not need. In such cases, you may wish to develop a custom plugin to meet your needs or  to ensure that only the features you need are added.  need you to include CSS files, images, or other media. In addition, most plugins can be used  by simply calling a method, but many allow you to set options by adding arguments to the  method call in your script. Downloading and Installing a Plugin First, you will need to download a plugin. For an example, you will download a plugin  named Chosen, which takes plain select elements and transforms them into a more user- friendly selection tool  which is especially helpful for select elements with a lengthy number  of options .  You can download the files you will need by going to http:  plugins.jquery.com chosen   and clicking “Download Now.” This will take you to the developer’s GitHub site where you  can download the zip file. You will need to extract the zip file into the same folder where you  have jQuery installed  you can, of course, choose a different folder as long as you remember to  alter the   element’s src attribute appropriately .  Once you have the files in place, take note of what is included. In some cases, you may  wish to delete files you don’t intend to use. This plugin contains developer and production  versions of the plugin JavaScript file and the CSS file. Also, it includes some example pages    280  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  and a version of the plugin for the Prototype library. If you decide to delete some of these to  save space, you will need to be sure to keep at least the following files:  chosen.jquery.min.js chosen.min.css chosen-sprite@2x.png chosen-sprite.png  The next step is to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document.  For this example, you will use a simple contact form, which includes both a single and a multiple  select box so that you can see what the plugin does. Save the following HTML code as selects.html:  Your own JavaScript file is included  The Chosen plugin is included The jQuery library is included The accompanying CSS file is included               Select Boxes                          Contact Us       Name:                  Referred By:               Search         Another Site         Word of Mouth         Social Media                    Foods You Like:               Pizza         Burgers         Salads         Fried Asparagus         Steamed Asparagus         CHOCOLATE!                    Comments:              Chapter 10: Using Plugins  281               You will notice that the companion CSS file is included, as well as the additional JavaScript  file. The order in which the JavaScript files are included is important: You must include jQuery  first, any plugins after that, and your own JavaScript file last. This ensures that the plugins can  use jQuery, and that your script can use both jQuery and the included plugins! Once this is in  place, the plugin is installed and ready to use.  Calling the Method Your next task will be to invoke the plugin by calling the method that it uses. In most cases, you  do this as you would most other jQuery methods, by chaining it to a jQuery object  a collection  of one or more elements . You will need to refer to the documentation for each plugin you use to  determine what the name of the method will be.  In this case, you have two select elements: a single select and a multiple select. Both  of these have the class use-chosen, so you can use this to make the Chosen plugin work  for both select elements by calling the chosen   method, as in the following code  save as  selects.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".use-chosen" .chosen  ;  } ;  That’s it! The plugin will now transform both select boxes to be more user-friendly. Open  the selects.html file in your browser and try making selections. You’ll notice some changes,  such as a “search” box being available for the single select box and that selecting items in the  multiple select box pops each selected item into a list at the top of the box rather than allowing  each of them to potentially be hidden from view by a long list of options  this makes it easy to  see what you have selected .  There are also some visual changes and other things you may notice. As you can see,   simply using the plugin with the default options already helps to make the select boxes easier to  use. Figure 10-1 shows the page before the plugin is used  plain select boxes , and Figure 10-2  shows the page after the plugin is used and some items have been selected  this is what you  have saved .  Setting Plugin Options As with many other plugins, Chosen allows you to set numerous options. Most often,  options are set by including one or more arguments to the method that you call. Often, you  are able to send a single argument: a map of property names and values, as in the following  example code:  $ "my-element" .methodName { name: value, name: value } ;   282  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 10-1 How the page would look without the plugin installed  Figure 10-2 The plugin adds some new features to the select boxes.   Chapter 10: Using Plugins  283  You have used this pattern many times throughout this book, so you are already familiar with  the syntax you will need to use.  In the case of the Chosen plugin, you can tell it not to display the search box for the single   select lists if there are fewer than a certain number of options in the list. You can also tell it  what text to use as the default  when no options are selected  for select boxes with the multiple  attribute. These are set using the disable_search_threshold and placeholder_text_multiple properties. Update your selects.js file to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".use-chosen" .chosen {     disable_search_threshold: 5,      placeholder_text_multiple: "Choose Options..."   } ;  } ;  Reload the selects.html page in your browser. Since the single select is now set to not display  the search box when there are fewer than five options, you will now get no search box when  you activate the select box, since there are only four options. The multiple select box will now  display the default text “Choose Options…” until you make a selection. Figure 10-3 shows the  single select box when it is activated after the options have been set.  Of course, this plugin has numerous other options that you can set by adding them to the  map you pass to the chosen   method. Also, Chosen allows the use of attributes and classes as  additional means of setting particular options. You can view the full list by going to the Chosen  options page at http:  harvesthq.github.io chosen options.html.  Figure 10-3 The select box no longer has the search box since there aren’t many options.   284  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This 10-1  Practice Using a Plugin  pr10-01.html pr10-01.js  This project allows you to practice using a plugin. You will again use the  Chosen plugin, but this time you will have a particularly long list of options to  choose from in a select box  the fifty U.S. states plus the District of Columbia .  To make it easier, you will apply the Chosen plugin, which will allow you to search the options  list more easily.  Step by Step  1.

In the pr10-01.js file, add jQuery code that will implement the Chosen plugin. Also, set  an option when implementing—set the no_results_text property to the value “No state  found for.”  3. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".use-chosen" .chosen {      no_results_text: "No state found for"    } ;  } ;  4. Open the pr10-01.html file in your Web browser. Activate the select box and perform some  searches. If a state cannot be found for a search, then the string "No state found for" will be  displayed followed by the text you entered.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of implementing plugins in order to enhance  a select box for users with the Chosen plugin. This allowed you to take a select element  with 51 options and make it easier for users to select one by providing a search function  for them.  Helpful Plugins  There are numerous plugins available for the jQuery library, so you can almost always find  something that will suit your needs. In this section, some popular and or helpful plugins will  be highlighted so that you can see what type of features can be achieved with them.  jQuery UI The jQuery UI plugin is a library of related plugins that are designed to help Web applications  feel more like desktop applications. It adds the ability to drag and drop items, resize items, sort  items, and more. In addition, there are a number of widgets included that can do anything from  adding a progress bar to adding a date picker.  The first thing to do is go to the jQuery UI site at http:  jqueryui.com  and download the  package. You can download everything or customize it to include only what you need. If you  are customizing, you may wish to read further into the documentation to see what features you  are adding or removing from the plugin.  Once you have the plugin library downloaded and unpacked, you can make use of it by  including the necessary files in your HTML code. At minimum, you will need the jquery-ui .min.css and jquery-ui.min.js files included in the page. Some features or widgets may require  additional file inclusions.   Chapter 10: Using Plugins  287  As an example, you will add these two files to an HTML document. Since the package is  large, it will be stored in a subfolder for access. For offline use, you can simply insert the files  from their default locations within the package, as shown in the following HTML code  the  package has been stored in a subfolder named jqui :               jQuery UI          .cool { width:300px; height:50px; border:1px solid 000; }     .cooler { background-color:CCC; border:5px solid 444;                width:500px; height:200px; }       <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"          href="jqui themes base minified jquery-ui.min.css">        <script src="jqui ui minified jquery-ui.min.js" type="text  javascript">            My Page      This div could be a lot cooler.         <input type="submit" action="cooler.html" id="sub" value="Make  Cooler!">            Save the file as jqueryUIdemo.html. As you can see, the files are included as with other  plugins. This page creates a   with a button that claims it will make the   “cooler.”  This will be done using classes, which you can see within the    tags. With this  installed, you can now use some of the core components of the library. Additional Animation Options One helpful feature is the addition of extra animation options. You will recall that the core  jQuery library had the addClass  , removeClass  , and toggleClass   methods. These allowed  you to simply add or remove classes, but they provided no animation on their own  you would  need to use animate   or one of the included animation methods such as slideDown   along  with them .  The jQuery UI plugin allows you to add arguments to these method calls  and others  such as the show   and hide   methods  that will animate the changes to the element. For    288  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  example, by providing a speed and easing argument to toggleClass  , you can animate each of  the changes to the element that are made by adding or removing the specified classes. Using  your jqueryUIdemo.html page, you can take the   with the class “cool” and add the class  “cooler” when the button is clicked. The “cooler” class has a larger width, height, and border,  and also has different colors for the background and border. Using the following code will  animate the addition or removal of the “cooler” class  save as jqueryUIdemo.js :  $ document .ready function   {   $ "sub" .click function event  {       event.preventDefault  ;       if  $ this .val   === "Make Cooler!"  {         $ this .val "Make Less Cool." ;       }       else {         $ this .val "Make Cooler!" ;       }      $ ".cool" .toggleClass "cooler", 1000, "easeInOutCubic" ;   } ; } ;  Code to change the  button text based on  the toggle state  Notice the additional arguments that are  added: a speed and an easing function  Open the jqueryUIdemo.html page in your browser and click the “Make Cooler!” button. The    will expand and change color. You can return it to its original state by clicking the button again.  Figure 10-4 shows the initial page, and Figure 10-5 shows the page after the button is clicked.  You will notice that the easing function is not one you have been able to use before with  the jQuery library alone, which only included linear and swing. The jQuery UI plugin adds a  number of additional easing options that you can use. A complete listing can be found on the  jQuery UI site at http:  api.jqueryui.com easings . Example Widget The jQuery UI plugin includes numerous widgets to enhance the user experience, which  simply require you to call a method to make use of them. One of these is the date picker, which  can turn a plain text input element into an element that allows the user to choose a date from a  calendar that displays when the field is clicked.  Figure 10-4 The initial page   Chapter 10: Using Plugins  289  Figure 10-5 The page after the button is clicked  To see this in action, you will add a form with a simple text field to your jqueryUIdemo  .html page. Add the following code just prior to the closing   tag and save the file:            Date:                          This adds a form with a simple text field with an id of date.  Next, you simply need to apply the datepicker   method from the jQuery UI plugin to the  date text field. You can do this by adding a line of code to your jqueryUIdemo.js file. Update  the file to use the following code and save it:  The datepicker   method is used on the date element  $ document .ready function   {   $ "date" .datepicker  ;   $ "sub" .click function event  {       event.preventDefault  ;       if  $ this .val   === "Make Cooler!"  {         $ this .val "Make Less Cool." ;       }       else {         $ this .val "Make Cooler!" ;       }     $ ".cool" .toggleClass "cooler", 1000, "easeInOutCubic" ;   } ; } ;   290  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 10-6 The date picker calendar is displayed.  Reload the jqueryUIdemo.html page in your browser and click the text field. A calendar will  appear that allows you to choose a date to be entered into the field. Figure 10-6 shows the date  picker displayed once the field is clicked. Further Information The jQuery UI plugin is very extensive, so it cannot be covered in full detail here.

You want to add the right class to the  input field if the submitted answer is right and the wrong class if the answer is wrong. In  addition, you will want to “bounce” the input field if the answer is right and “shake” the field  if the answer is wrong. The effect   method can be used in the following general format to  create the effects:  $ "my-element" .effect effectName, duration ;  2. Create a JavaScript file and save it as pr10-02.js. Add jQuery JavaScript code so that if the   answer is not “here,” the input field will “shake” and have the wrong class added to it. If  the answer is “here,” then the input field should “bounce” and have the right class added to  it. Remember to prevent the default action and to remove all classes from the field once the  submit button is clicked but before performing the test. Also, assign the ans element to a  variable so that it can easily be reused.  3. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ "qform" .submit function event  {     var $ans = $ "ans" ;     event.preventDefault  ;     $ans.removeClass "right wrong" ;       if  $ans.val   !== "here"  {         $ans.addClass "wrong" .effect "shake", 800 ;       }       else {         $ans.addClass "right" .effect "bounce", 800 ;   Chapter 10: Using Plugins  293        }   } ; } ;  4. Open the pr10-02.html file in your Web browser. Answer the question wrong and click   the Submit button. The field should shake and turn light red. Answer correctly and submit  again. This time, the field should bounce and turn light green.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of the jQuery UI plugin and learned the new bounce and shake effects that are available using the effect   method.

For  instance, you may need to add something that no plugin addresses yet, or you may want only  a specific set of features but find that the plugins available with those features also have many  more that you do not need.  In either case, jQuery allows you to create custom plugins to extend the jQuery library   as needed. You can either write plugins specifically for you or your organization, or you can  create plugins that are meant to be shared with others and add them to the jQuery plugin  repository. In this chapter, you will learn how to create a basic plugin. You will see how to use  global methods, how to use jQuery object methods  most common , and also how to add a  callback function to your plugin methods.  Global Methods and the $ Alias  While not as common, there are times when a plugin does not act on a jQuery object, and thus  may be a candidate for a global method. When creating a plugin such as this, you will need  to consider the availability of the $ alias and how to minimize the chances of having naming  conflicts with other jQuery methods and plugins. Ensuring $ Is Available There are times where jQuery may be available but the $ alias may not, such as when the  .noConflict   method is used. To ensure that your plugin works whether $ is available or not,  you can prefix jQuery methods with the full jQuery.methodName   syntax, or you can enclose  your plugin code within an immediately invoked function that defines the $ alias for your  plugin internally.  To make use of $ internally, you can use what is called an immediately invoked function  expression, which encloses a function call within parentheses. This syntax ensures that the  function is executed immediately rather than waiting for another statement to call it. The  following code shows an example of this and how it can be used to define the jQuery $ alias  internally:   function $  {      Plugin code... }  jQuery ;   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  299  The outer parentheses provide a wrapper, which sends the global jQuery object as the  argument to the function contained within it. The function then assigns the jQuery object to $  when it runs, making $ available within the function and allowing your plugin code to use it as  you normally would. Creating Methods and Minimizing Naming Conflicts To create your global method plugin, you can simply add a named function within the  immediately invoked function, as in the following code:   function $  {   $.chooseRandom = function   {        Plugin code...   }; }  jQuery ;  Here, the global method is named $.chooseRandom  . Since this plugin will use only this  single method, you simply need a method name that is unique  doesn’t conflict with other  jQuery global methods or other plugin global methods .  NOTE Avoiding conflicts with names in other plugins is more difficult, since it is harder to  discover all other possible plugins that could be using the name. However, choosing  a meaningful and descriptive name will help to keep the chance of a conflict to a  minimum. Using a Single Method With the method function set up, you simply need to fill in some code so that it will perform  a task. Suppose you want this function to choose a random number between zero and another  number, which will be defined by the user. The following code can be used  save as choose- random.js :   function $  {   $.chooseRandom = function items  {     return  Math.floor Math.random   * items  ;   }; }  jQuery ;  This code uses the Math.floor    and Math.random   methods in JavaScript to generate a  random number. This syntax produced a number between zero and one less than the value  of items  sent as an argument . For example, if the value of items is 5, then this will return a  random inclusive number between zero and four  the number could be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 .  This type of selection is great if you are planning to use the chosen number to select an  item in an array. However, you may prefer the result to be a number between one and items  one-based  rather than zero-based. For example, you may want the user to guess a number  between 1 and 10 and generate a random number within this range as the correct answer.   300  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  You can add a second argument to allow the user to determine whether the random number   returned will be zero-based or one-based, as in the following code  update your choose- random.js file and save :   function $  {   $.chooseRandom = function items, start  {     if  !parseInt items   !parseInt start   {       return  "Error: Arguments must be integers." ;     }     if  items < 1  {       return  "Error: First argument must be 1 or greater" ;     }     return  Math.floor Math.random   * items   + start;   }; }  jQuery ;  The method now accepts two  arguments: the number of  possible random numbers and  the starting number  If an integer cannot be  derived from either of  the arguments, an error  message is returned  If the first argument  items  is not at least 1, then an  error message is returned  The random number is generated and returned;  notice that the value of start is added to the  generated number  zero-based  so that the  number will be start-based  Notice that in addition to adding the extra option, this updated method adds a safeguard to  ensure that only integers are sent to it as arguments. If not, an error will be returned. Also, if  the value of items is less than one, then an error is generated, since the assumption is that at  least one possible number should be available to return.  The final return statement generates a random number between zero and one less than the   value of items, and then adds the value of start to it. This allows the default to be zero-based   adding zero will not affect it  and also allows the start of the range to be defined by the user.  For example, if the value of 1 is sent as the second argument, then 1 will be added to the zero- based result  0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 2, and so on . Some further examples are shown here:  var randNum = $.chooseRandom 5 ;    Error var randNum = $.chooseRandom 5, 2 ;    randNum is between 2 and 6 var randNum = $.chooseRandom 10, 1 ;    randNum is between 1 and 10 var randNum = $.chooseRandom -5 ;    Error var randNum = $.chooseRandom 5, -5 ;    randNum is between -5 and -1  As you can see, this offers the user a variety of options in the type of random number that is  returned, while checking for errors with the arguments that are sent.  To make use of your new plugin  choose-random.js , you will need to create an HTML   page, attach jQuery and your plugin to it, and then attach your own JavaScript file  which will  use your new plugin . First, save the following HTML code as random-page.html:              Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  301     How Random!          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }                            How Random!    This page has some very random stuff on it!           This simply creates a basic page that inserts all the necessary script files and creates an empty  rand-num element where you will place your random number once you retrieve it.  Next, save the following file as choose-random.js  this is where you will write the code   that uses jQuery and your plugin :  $ document .ready function   {   var randNum = $.chooseRandom 10, 1 ;   $ "rand-num" .html ' Random Number ' + randNum ; } ;  The randNum variable is created to hold  the result if calling the plugin method  The chosen random number  is displayed on the page  Here, the $.chooseRandom   method is called, which is the method used for the plugin. Calling  it with the arguments 10 and 1 will return a random number from 1 to 10. The result is then  displayed in the rand-num element.  Open the random-page.html file in your browser. A random number will display. You can  refresh the page to get different random numbers. Figure 11-1 shows an example of the page  with one of the random numbers loaded. Using Multiple Methods If your plugin will require multiple methods, then making each method global increases the  risk that one or more of them will conflict with another method name within the global scope.  For example, if you want to have a plugin that uses one method to return a random number and  a second method to return a random quote from a specified set of elements, you could place  both methods in the global scope, as in the following code:   function $  {   $.randomNum = function items, start  {        method code...   };   302  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 11-1 A random number is displayed by the plugin.    $.randomQuote = function $elements  {        method code...   }; }  jQuery ;  A second global  method is added!  In this code, you have both a $.randomNum   and a $.randomQuote   method in the jQuery  global scope. With each additional method, you increase the chances that one of the method  names will conflict with another global name or plugin that will be used on the page.  To help prevent this, it is a good idea to place all the methods your plugin will use within  an object that contains as unique a name as possible. This allows you to use as many methods  as needed with less possibility for conflicts. For example, the following code goes back  to your original name  $.chooseRandom , but allows for methods within it to be called by  using $.chooseRandom.methodName. This means that $.chooseRandom will be in the global  scope, but its methods can only be called by first accessing the $.chooseRandom object, thus  removing its methods from the global scope.  An example of this technique is shown next:   function $  {   $.chooseRandom = {     num: function items, start  {          method code...     },      quote: function $quoteDivs  {          method code...     }   } }  jQuery ;  Notice how $.chooseRandom is a map  object  with properties and values. Since the value of  each property  num and quote  is a method, the names become method names. This allows you    Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  303  to choose a random number by calling $.chooseRandom.num   and to choose a random quote  by calling $.chooseRandom.quote  .  To finish this example, you can fill in the code for each method. Update your choose-  random.js plugin file to use the following code and save it:  The random number method that was used  previously will choose a random number   function $  {   $.chooseRandom = {     num: function items, start  {       var startNum = start  0;       if  !parseInt items   !parseInt startNum   {         return  "Error: Arguments must be numeric." ;       }       if  items < 1  {         return  "Error: First argument must be 1 or greater" ;       }       return  Math.floor Math.random   * items   + startNum;     },      quote: function $quoteDivs  {       var items = $quoteDivs.length;       return $quoteDivs.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;     }   } }  jQuery ;  The quote   method takes in a collection of elements, gets  the number of elements in the collection, and returns a  random quote from the text of one of the elements  Notice how the quote   method works: It takes in a collection of elements  which contain  quotes for their text , then determines how many elements are in the collection. This is used  to then determine the index of a quote within the collection that matches a random number  chosen from zero  since element collections are zero-based  up to one less than the number  of elements. The text of the random element that is chosen is then returned, giving the user a  random quote.  To see this in action, you will also need to update your HTML and JavaScript files to make   use of the updated plugin. First, update your random-page.html file to use the following code  and save it:               How Random!          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }             304  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide                 How Random!    This page has some very random stuff on it!           Random Quotes     Well, this is really random!     I have been randomly selected!     That's the amulet!     Did you randomly arrive here?     Serendipity is a happy happenstance.         This adds a rand-quote element that contains a number of odd quotes. Each quote is  contained within a   element with a class of quote. By sending this collection to the  .chooseRandom.quote   method, you can retrieve one of them to display instead of seeing the  entire set at once  displaying it this way initially allows those without JavaScript enabled to  still view the quotes .  Next, update your random-page.js file to use the following code and save it:  Executes code to use the $.chooseRandom.num   method  $ document .ready function   {   var randNum = $.chooseRandom.num 5, 1 ;   $ "rand-num" .html ' Random Number ' + randNum ;     var $qWrapper = $ "rand-quote" ,          $qDivs = $ "rand-quote div.quote" ,          randQuote = $.chooseRandom.quote $qDivs ;   $qWrapper.html ' Random Quote ' ;   $qWrapper.append ' ' + randQuote + ' ' ; } ;  Replaces the content of the rand-quote element with the new  heading and the returned random quote  Retrieves the text of a random   element within the collection and  returns the random quote text  Assigns the collection of   elements within the rand-quote element to a  variable, $qDivs, for later use  Assigns the rand-quote   element to a variable, $qWrapper, for later use   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  305  Figure 11-2 A possible result of using your $.chooseRandom plugin  Here, the rand-quote element is assigned to $qWrapper and the collection of    elements within it that have the quote class is assigned to $qDivs. The result of running  $.chooseRandom.quote   on this collection is then assigned to randQuote, which will now  contain the text of one of those   elements chosen at random. Finally, the result is  displayed on the page, overwriting the original content of the rand-quote   by using the  html   method  the append   that follows is for readability here; you can simply continue to  concatenate within the html   method if desired .  Reload the random-page.html file in your browser. You’ll see a random number and a   random quote displayed. You can reload the page to see different results. Figure 11-2 shows  one of the possible results of this script.  Ask the Expert Q: Should I create a plugin that uses a global method? I'm not sure that is the best way to   do what I need to do.  A: A global method is not typically what you would create, as you will see in the next section.   Most plugins are designed to work on a jQuery object  a collection of elements , which  is more commonly what a user would need. A global method would be better suited for  something that works outside of the document structure  for example, the jQuery global  methods $.get and $.post retrieve information from another document, so calling these  methods on an element within the current document wouldn’t necessarily be helpful .   continued    306  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Q: The global plugin sure required a lot of coding for the developer. Could this be   optimized?  A: In the examples, the $.chooseRandom.num   method required less of the developer  call the  method with arguments, use the result . The $.chooseRandom.quote   required more, since  you needed to determine the wrapper element and which elements to select to obtain the  random quote. This method would definitely be better suited as a jQuery object method,  which you will learn about in the next section.  Q: I would like to have the plugin work without sending it any arguments. Can this be   done?  A: Yes! You will just need to be sure to set default values for each of the arguments so that the  plugin will work when called. In the next section, you will see how using a map of property  names and values can ease this process for both you and the user.  Creating jQuery Object Methods  While a plugin using a global method can be useful for some tasks, it is often preferable to  create a plugin that acts on one or more elements in a collection. This allows the plugin to  use syntax that is more familiar to users, since it will be much like calling any other jQuery  method, such as show   or append  .  When creating object methods, there are several things you will need to consider:   extending the jQuery object using $.fn, ensuring that implicit iteration will work with the  plugin, and allowing the user to send a map of customized options to the plugin if desired. Extending the jQuery Object To create a new jQuery object method, you will need to extend the jQuery object using jQuery .fn, which can be shortened to $.fn when you assign the $ shortcut to your plugin code. This  will look quite similar to creating a global method, aside from using $.fn. The following code  shows an example of this:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function   {        plugin code...   }; }  jQuery ;  With this syntax in place, the plugin can be used just like any other jQuery method on an  element or collection of elements, as in the following code:  $ ".my-elements" .chooseRandom  ;   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  307  As you can see, this allows you to call your method directly on one or more elements within  the DOM.  Within your plugin method, the bare keyword this will refer to the current jQuery object,   which is the collection of elements that was used to call it. For the code example you just used,  this would refer to the $ ".my-elements"  collection. You can refer to this within your plugin  method at any time to refer to the collection and use any necessary jQuery methods on it, for  example, find   or each  .  To begin, you will update your random-page.html file to use the following code and   save it:               How Random!          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }                          How Random!    This page has some very random stuff on it!        Random Quotes     Well, this is really random!     I have been randomly selected!     That's the amulet!     Did you randomly arrive here?     Serendipity is a happy happenstance.         Random Quotes     Another set of random quotes? Really?     I can't believe there could be more random quotes!     Why?     John put you up to this, didn't he?     Please let this be the last random quote!          308  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Here, the random number piece is removed and the rand-quote element has been replaced by  two .rand-quote elements so that you can see your new plugin work on multiple elements. The  class="quote" attribute was also removed from the inner   elements. You’ll access these  in a different way for the plugin  which will save the user from supplying that class on each of  those elements .  Next, you will need to create your plugin by extending the jQuery object using $.fn. This  plugin will need to be called on any element with a class of .rand-quote. It will then need to  determine how many child   elements are within each of the .rand-quote elements and  display the random result for each of the elements. Update your choose-random.js file to use  the following code and save it:  The jQuery object is extended with the new  chooseRandom   method   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function   {     var $coll = this.children "div" ;     items = $coll.length,     rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;     this.html ' Random Quote  ' + rQuote + ' ' ;   }; }  jQuery ;  The current element’s HTML is updated to include  a heading and the selected random quote  A variable named rQuote will hold the result of  selecting a random element’s text from the $coll collection  A variable named items will hold the number  of matching elements  A variable named $coll will be assigned the  collection of   elements within the current  element  this   This appears to be a straightforward process. The jQuery object is extended, and the    elements within the selected element are collected and placed in $coll. The number of items in  $coll is assigned to items, eq   is used along with Math.random   and text   to get the text of  the element at a randomly selected index within $coll, and the result replaces the content of the  currently selected element.  With this in place, you can update your random-page.js file to use the following code and   save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom  ; } ;  That’s it! You now have a plugin that you can use without a lot of code needing to be inserted  by the user. Your plugin method can simply be called once your plugin code is inserted in the  page.  Reload the random-page.html file in your browser. You will see two “Random Quote”   sections; however, there appears to be a problem! Figure 11-3 shows an example of the page  when it is loaded in a browser.   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  309  Figure 11-3 What happened to the first set of quotes?  The plugin worked, but it is overwriting both elements that use the .rand-quote class with   the chosen quote from the last element that has the class. That certainly was not the plan! It  appears as though jQuery is using implicit iteration to update all of the elements that use the  .rand-quote class each time your plugin is run, which means that only the last change will  be displayed in the final result. To fix this, your plugin will need to enable implicit iteration  internally so that each element is treated according to its own content within your plugin. Using Implicit Iteration and Returning a jQuery Object To fix the issue and use implicit iteration within your plugin, you can make use of the jQuery  each   method, which can be used to iterate over each element within the collection on which  your method was called  stored in this .  By using each   and making some adjustments to the code, you can get the plugin working   as expected for each of the elements that has the .rand-quote class. Update your choose- random.js file to use the following code and save it:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function   {     this.each function   {       $elmt = $ this ,        $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,        items = $coll.length,        rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;       $elmt.html ' Random Quote  ' + rQuote + ' ' ;     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  The each   method is used on this, which will  cycle through each of the elements within the  selection; in this case, these will be the two  elements that have the .rand-quote class  This line is updated to use $elmt rather than the bare this keyword  Another update to use $elmt rather than this  $ this , which is the current element when within  the each   method, gets assigned to $elmt   310  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 11-4 The two random quote sections now display a quote from within their own  content.  This time, each   is called to iterate over each of the elements within this internally. Within the  each   method, the current element is referred to by $ this , so this value is assigned to $elmt to make things more clear. The $elmt variable is then used to get the child   elements of  the current element and place them into $coll. The length and random quote are obtained as  before, then the result is displayed using $elmt.html   to place the new content into the proper  element.  Reload the random-page.html file in your browser and view the results. You should  now have a random quote from each set of quotes, rather than one overwriting the other.  Figure 11-4 shows one of the possible results.  This now works as expected, but there is one more thing you will want to do. Since the   plugin does not return a jQuery object, it cannot be chained along with other jQuery methods,  so calling $ ".rand-quote" hide  .chooseRandom  .slideDown 1000  would not work. It would  instead return undefined for one of the methods and cause the plugin to fail.  To fix this, you simply return the jQuery object on which your method was called by   adding return before your this.each   iteration. Update your choose-random.js file to use the  following code and save it:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function   {     return this.each function   {       $elmt = $ this ,        $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,        items = $coll.length,        rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;       $elmt.html ' Random Quote  ' + rQuote + ' ' ;  The return keyword is added  so that the method will return  the jQuery object on which the  method was called   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  311      } ;   } }  jQuery ;  By adding the return keyword, the jQuery collection is returned and allows the method to be  used as part of a method chain. You can now focus on providing users of your plugin with  additional options by allowing them to use an options map as an argument to your plugin  method.  User Customization with an Options Map To allow users to set options using a map, you will need to have your plugin obtain the values  from the map and use them as needed. The first change is straightforward: You will need to  update your method so that it takes an argument  which will be the map submitted by the user ,  as in the following code:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {          plugin code...     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  The custom argument is added to  receive the user map, if supplied  To use values included in the map, you can simply use the property names that are available.  For example, suppose the user called your plugin as shown in this code:  $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom { weight: "bold", style: "italic" } ;  In your method, these values can be accessed through the argument name  custom , which   acts as an object since it is sent a map. In this way, you can get the value of the properties by  using custom.weight and custom.style, as in the following code:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {       var fontWeight = custom.weight,            fontStyle = custom.style;        continue plugin code...     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  While this works if the user sends both properties in the map, it could cause the remainder of  your plugin to fail if it is depending on these values. To ensure that everything will work, you    312  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  need a stable method of providing default values that are only overwritten if the user supplies  new values.  The jQuery library gives you a helpful method named $.extend  , which takes in two   arguments: a map of default values and a map that will overwrite any default values with the  new ones supplied while leaving any unchanged values alone. This offers an excellent way to  allow the user to set as many or as few options as desired, or even to call your plugin method  with no arguments and simply use your default values.  The following code illustrates the use of $.extend   applied within your plugin method:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {       var defs = {                   weight: "normal",                    style: "normal"                   },            custOps = $.extend defs, custom ,          continue plugin code...     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  A map of default values is  defined  The $.extend   method is used  to update the property values  in defs with the values of any  properties in custom by the same  name; other values are left alone  As you can see, a default map named defs is defined and provides default values for weight and height. Next, $.extend   is used to overwrite the property values in defs with the values of  any properties in custom  sent by the user  that have the same property name, while leaving  any remaining values unchanged  thus using the default value . The result of this is a new map,  which will look like one of the following: all default values  if no values were changed by the  user , some default values and some custom values from the user, and all new values  every  default value was changed by the user . This new map is assigned to custOps, which can then  be used to access the needed values.  With this in place, you can update your plugin method to set the font weight and font style   for the   element that is output around the chosen random quote. Update your choose- random.js file to use the following code and save it:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {       var defs = {                   weight: "normal",                    style: "normal"                   },            custOps = $.extend defs, custom ,            $elmt = $ this ,            $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,            items = $coll.length,    Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  313            rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;      $elmt.html ' Random Quote <div style="font-weight:' +       custOps.weight +'; font-style:' + custOps.style + ';">' + rQuote       + ' ' ;     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  The values of the custom default options are  applied to update the style settings of the    element; note that these three lines should be on a  single line in your editor to avoid errors!  As you can see, this updates the   element that displays the quote by altering its style  attribute and using the values of the weight and style properties in custOps  custOps.weight and  custOps.style .  Your plugin will now use “normal” for either or both of the values if not customized by the   user within an options map. In this way, the user can call your plugin with no arguments, or  can send an options map that customized one or more of the properties to specific values.  Update your random-page.js file to use the following code and save it:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom { weight: "bold", style: "italic" } ; } ;  Reload the random-page.html file in your browser and view the results. You will see that the  quote has been made bold and italic by sending your customized options map. Figure 11-5  shows one possible result when viewed in a browser.  You can further test this by setting just one of the options or setting none. As you will see,   this gives you a lot of flexibility that you can provide to the users of your plugin!  Figure 11-5 A random quote is displayed, bold and italic.   314  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This 11-1  Practice Plugin Options  pr11-01.html pr11-01.js choose-random.js  This project allows you to practice working with plugin options maps by  having you add more options to your chooseRandom plugin. These new  options will allow the user to specify the level of the heading displayed  with the random quote and the text that will display within the heading.  Step by Step  1. Place the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr11-01.html:               How Random!          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }                          How Random!

John put you up to this, didn't he?     Please let this be the last random quote!          Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  315  2. Use the choose-random.js file that you have been using in this chapter and update it so that   it allows the user to update two additional properties named hLevel and hText. Add these  properties to the plugin so that they will allow the user to specify the level of the heading  included with the random quote and the text within the heading. The default value for  hLevel will be 2, and the default value for hText will be "Random Quote".  3. Save the file. When complete, the code should look like this:   function $  {      $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {       return this.each function   {         var defs = {                   weight: "normal",                   style: "normal",                   hLevel: 2,                   hText: "Random Quote"                   },           custOps = $.extend defs, custom ,           $elmt = $ this ,           $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,           items = $coll.length,           rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;         $elmt.html ' ' + custOps.hText + '< h' +         custOps.hLevel + '><div style="font-weight:' + custOps.weight +         '; font-style:' + custOps.style + ';">' + rQuote + ' ' ;       } ;     }   }  jQuery ;  4. In the pr11-01.js file, write code so that the chooseRandom plugin is used and displays  a random quote in italics and with the heading text “Cool Quote.” Save the file. When  complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {      $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom { style: "italic", hText: "Cool Quote"} ;   } ;  5. Open the pr11-01.html file in your Web browser. Both headings should now say “Cool   Quote” and both quotes should be in italics. You can go back and alter options as desired to  obtain different results. Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of option maps and plugins to update your plugin  method so that it could use two additional options, giving the user some additional flexibility  when using your plugin.   316  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Adding a Callback Function  Another way to allow customization is to allow users of your plugin to use callback functions. The  jQuery library implements these often, as you have seen throughout the book. Often, a callback  function is used so that code can be run once the operation of the main method has completed. You can add any number of named callback functions to your plugin. While you may   have other callbacks that allow users to do things such as calculate values, you would most  commonly add only one callback that would run when the other plugin tasks are complete.  To begin, you will need to add another option to your default options list: an empty   function. You then need to call the function once your other tasks have completed. This is  shown in the following code  update your choose-random.js file to use this code and save it :   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {       var defs = {                   weight: "normal",                    style: "normal",                    complete: function   {}                   },            custOps = $.extend defs, custom ,            $elmt = $ this ,            $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,            items = $coll.length,            rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .text  ;      $elmt.html ' Random Quote <div style="font-weight:' +       custOps.weight +'; font-style:' + custOps.style + ';">' + rQuote       + '  ' ;       custOps.complete.call this ;     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  An empty function is added and  assigned to the complete   property   These lines should be on a  single line in your editor  Calls the callback function  As you can see, a new property, complete, is added to the default map. It is simply an empty  function that will do nothing by default. However, if the user supplies a function to the  complete property when calling the plugin with an options map, the function supplied by the  user will be run when it is called by the plugin. Since the callback function needs to run after  the other tasks have completed, it is placed at the end of the plugin code. Instead of calling it  normally, it is called using the JavaScript call method, with a reference to this, which allows  the user to make use of the jQuery $ this  selector when coding the callback function.  NOTE If you are using a jQuery method within your plugin method that takes time or retrieves  information, such as animate   or $.get  , simply calling your callback function at the  end of the plugin method code may not work  it may get called before the jQuery  method completes . To adjust for this, you can place the code to call your callback  function within the callback function of the jQuery method you are using.   Chapter 11: Creating Plugins  317  With the callback setup in place, the user can use it to perform additional tasks once your   plugin tasks have completed. For example, the following code will call the plugin with two  options set: the style property and the complete property, which will be assigned a function, and  trigger it as the callback function within your plugin  update your random-page.js file to use this  code and save it :  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom { style: "italic", complete:    function   {         $ this .css "font-size", "+=10" ;     }   } ; } ;  In this case, the callback function is used to increase the font size of text within the    elements with a class of .rand-quote. Since there was no font size adjustment option yet, the  user was able to do this by using the jQuery css   method within the plugin’s callback function.  As you can see, this offers a great deal of flexibility to users of your plugin to extend options  or perform additional tasks when needed.  Reload the random-page.html file in your browser and view the result. Once the page   loads, you should have random quotes in italics for both “Random Quote” sections, and the  font size for these sections should be larger. Figure 11-6 shows one of the possible results of  loading this page in a browser.  Figure 11-6 The font size is now larger.   318  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This 11-2  Practice with Callbacks  pr11-02.html pr11-02.js choose-random.js  This project allows you to practice using the callback function you  created in this chapter by having you perform a task after the plugin code  completes.  Step by Step  1. Insert the following HTML code into your editor and save the file as pr11-02.html:               How Random!          body { font-family:Verdana, sans-serif; }                          How Random!

Use the choose-random.js plugin file you have been using in this chapter. The code should   now include the callback function and look like this:   function $  {   $.fn.chooseRandom = function custom  {     return this.each function   {       var defs = {                   weight: "normal",                    style: "normal",                     complete: function   {}                   },            custOps = $.extend defs, custom ,            $elmt = $ this ,            $coll = $elmt.children "div" ,            items = $coll.length,            rQuote = $coll.eq Math.floor Math.random   * items  .           text  ;      $elmt.html ' Random Quote <div style="font-weight:' +       custOps.weight +'; font-style:' + custOps.style + ';">' +       rQuote + ' ' ;      custOps.complete.call this ;     } ;   } }  jQuery ;  3. Create a JavaScript file and save it as pr11-02.js. Write code so that the chooseRandom   plugin is called, sets the weight property to a value of "bold", and so the complete property  executes a callback function that will fade out the elements that use the plugin over 10  seconds. When complete, the code should look like this:  $ document .ready function   {   $ ".rand-quote" .chooseRandom { weight: "bold", complete:   function   {         $ this .fadeOut 10000 ;     }   } ; } ;  4. Open the pr11-02.html file in your Web browser. The random quotes should display, then   begin fading out slowly.

Chapter12  Advanced Techniques  and Further Resources  323   324  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Key Skills & Concepts        ● Debugging  ● Unit Testing   ●      Additional Resources  The jQuery library does a lot of work, but once you have your code in place, it is a good idea   to test the code to ensure that it does what it needs to do. In this chapter, you will look at  methods that can be used for debugging and testing your code, which can help you develop  coding standards for your team or organization.  First, you will look at some tools available for debugging JavaScript jQuery code. Next,  you will look at some tools that allow you to perform unit testing on your code. Finally, you  will be given some resources to enhance your knowledge of JavaScript jQuery should you  choose to pursue it further.  Debugging  Often, code doesn’t quite work as intended. While some issues are easy to resolve, others may  require quite a bit more time and effort to get fixed. There are numerous methods and tools you  can use to debug your code; and you will cover some of these in this section. Simple Alerts For some issues, using the JavaScript alert   method can be a handy way to quickly see where  the problem may be. You can use alert   to pop up one or more values to see if they are the  type of values you are expecting  a number, a string, a Boolean, and so on .  For example, suppose you are having an issue where you are trying to add one to a   number, but you’re getting unexpected results. For example, consider the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   var time = 0,       x = 400,        y = 400,       z = "400";    function sum x, y, z  {     return x + y + z;   }   time = sum x, y, z ;   $ "my-element" .hide  .show time ; } ;   Chapter 12: Advanced Techniques and Further Resources  325  Running this code, you will likely find that the show   method seems to be moving at a pace  that is much quicker than you had intended  which should be 1200 milliseconds . It appears  that something is not working correctly. Either the show   method is receiving a much lower  number than intended, or it is receiving a string that it does not recognize and is thus simply  displaying it with its default time delay.  In this case, you can probably see the problem already, but if there were more code separating  the variable definitions and the function call, this might not be as immediately apparent. Here, you  can see what value is being sent to the show   method by alerting the value of the time variable just  prior to your use of show  , as in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   var time = 0,       x = 400,        y = 400,       z = "400";    function sum x, y, z  {     return x + y + z;   }   time = sum x, y, z ;   alert time ;   $ "my-element" .hide  .show time ; } ;  This alert will tell you the value  that will be used on the next  line for the show   method  When this code is run, you will receive an alert with a value of 800400! Figure 12-1 shows an  example of how this alert may display from a browser.  Since show   is not working at an incredibly slow speed of 800,400 milliseconds, it looks   like this must be a string value that is causing show   to use a default time. Going back to  the function you call to set the time, you will see that it appears to be OK. It simply adds the  values sent to it: x, y, and z. This should lead you to check the values of those variables. When  you do, you will notice that the value for z is enclosed in quotes, which is making it a string  value. This means that JavaScript will add 400 + 400 + "400": The first two will be added as  numbers  giving 800 , while the last will be added as a string that will concatenate the numeric  800 with the string "400", giving you "800400".  To fix this, you can simply remove the quote marks from the value of the z variable and   the show   method will work as expected. This is shown in the following code, which fixes the  issue and removes the alert:  $ document .ready function   {   var time = 0,       x = 400,        y = 400,       z = 400;    function sum x, y, z  {     return x + y + z;   }  The quote marks have been  removed, making this a valid  number   326  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 12-1 The alert displayed when the code is run    time = sum x, y, z ;   $ "my-element" .hide  .show time ; } ;  Browser Developer Tools All of the major browsers now offer their own set of developer tools that can be opened from  the browser menu or via one or more shortcut keys  depending on the tool you want to open .  Each of these tools offers a JavaScript console, which can aid you in debugging JavaScript  jQuery code. They also offer tools to help you find DOM nodes, look at your HTML, test CSS  code, and more.  Which one you use may depend on your browser of choice. However, if you test in   multiple browsers  which is a good practice , you may become familiar with each one of them  as you work on different projects. Figure 12-2 shows the “Web Console” in Mozilla Firefox   Firefox Menu  Web Developer  Web Console . Figure 12-3 shows the “Developer Tools”  when opened in Google Chrome  Menu  Tools  Developer Tools .  No matter which you choose, you can use it to help you figure out where any issues may   be in your code  whether HTML, CSS, or JavaScript jQuery . For JavaScript jQuery, each one  offers a JavaScript console, which you can use to log values or display information as needed  while developing or debugging.  For example, using the console.log   method in JavaScript, you could simply display a   value on the console screen when needed. In many cases, this is far more convenient than an  alert, because it does not interrupt the task at hand with an alert pop-up box. Instead, the value  can be sent to the console for you to view while still having the code run as normal otherwise.   Chapter 12: Advanced Techniques and Further Resources  327  You can alter the code you used for an alert to log the same value to the console, as shown   Figure 12-2 Firefox Web Console  in the following code:  $ document .ready function   {   var time = 0,       x = 400,        y = 400,       z = 400;    function sum x, y, z  {     return x + y + z;   }   time = sum x, y, z ;   console.log time ;   $ "rand-quote" .hide  .show time ; } ;  The console.log method is used  to log a value on the JavaScript  console in the browser   328  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 12-3 Chrome Developer Tools  Figure 12-4 shows how this looks when displayed in the Google Chrome JavaScript console. As you can see, using the developer tools within a Web browser can certainly be helpful   and less invasive than inserting alerts in your code. In addition, the ability to work with HTML,  CSS, and the DOM of the document can be extremely useful when the issue may lie in one of  those areas rather than in the script itself. Using a Lint Tool A lint tool is a program that checks your code against a set of standards and returns anything it  finds that may be problematic. Not only can this help you find errors, but it can help you write  better and more efficient code as well.  Two popular JavaScript lint tools are   ● JSLint www.jslint.com   ● JSHint www.jshint.com   Chapter 12: Advanced Techniques and Further Resources  329  Figure 12-4 The value is logged to the JavaScript console.  Both tools allow you to check your JavaScript code for any number of issues. You can  select various options to tailor the tool to your specific needs  for example, assuming the  code is being run in a Web browser, a particular library is being used, or that the code is in  development . Figure 12-5 shows the options available in JSHint.  Since JSHint allows you to select an option that tells it jQuery is being used, this is a good   option for a jQuery example. Go to www.jsHint.com and paste the following code into the  input area:  $ document .ready function   {   x = 2;   if  x == 2  {     $ "my-element" .show 1000 ;   } } ;   330  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Figure 12-5 JSHint options  Make sure the “Browser” and “jQuery” check boxes are checked, make sure the “When code is  not in strict mode” check box is unchecked, and click the “Lint” button. You will receive a set  of errors.  The first error is shown in the following code:  Line 3: if  x == 2  { Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.  Here, the lint tool is picking up on the use of == rather than === for comparison. Since ==  performs type coercion, unexpected results can occur. It is considered best practice to use ===  when checking for equality, since it requires both values to be equal and have the same data  type.  The second error is shown in the following code:  Line 2: x = 2; 'x' is not defined.   Chapter 12: Advanced Techniques and Further Resources  331  Oops! It looks as though the var keyword was left off here. While it may not hurt in this case,  this can become problematic, especially when functions are added. Declaring a variable like  this within a function will make it global or overwrite the value of the global variable by the  same name. In either case, this can cause your code to have numerous issues if it is not fixed.  It is best to always include the var keyword when defining a variable.  The third and final error is shown in the following code:  Line 3: if  x == 2  { 'x' is not defined.  Since the variable x was not defined with the var keyword, the lint tool sees it as undefined  here, which is helpful when debugging, as JavaScript will let this proceed as normal  it will  define x with a value of 2 in the global scope, which causes this comparison to run as though  there were no errors . Since JavaScript attempts to fix things as best it can, it may be difficult  to find an error like this. However, the use of a lint tool can help you find such issues and  resolve them quickly.  Ask the Expert Q: Where can I learn more about browser developer tools? A: Here are some resources:   ● Chrome DevTools https:  developers.google.com chrome-developer-tools    ● Mozilla Developer Tools https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Tools   ● F12 Developer Tools – Internet Explorer http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library   ie hh673541%28v=vs.85%29.aspx  Q: Are there other JavaScript lint tools available? I would like to try out different tools to   see what works best for me.  A: Those listed already are popular, but you may find the following tools helpful as well:   ● JavaScript Lint www.javascriptlint.com   ● JSON Lint for JSON Syntax http:  jsonlint.com  Q: Is there anything else I can do to test my code? A: Yes! You can perform unit testing as you proceed through the development of your program.   The next section will discuss this topic in more detail.   332  jQuery: A Beginner’s Guide  Try This 12-1  Practice Using a Lint Tool  pr12-01.js  This project allows you to practice working with a lint tool to test your jQuery code  and ensure that it does not contain any potential errors or pitfalls.  Step by Step  1. Save the following code as pr12-01.js:  $ document .ready function   {   var x = 2;   if  x != 2  {     var y = 3;   }   else {     var y = 5;   }   $ "my-element .hide  .show 1000 ; } ;  2. Go to www.jshint.com and paste the code into the input area. Make sure the “Browser” and  “jQuery” check boxes are checked, make sure the “When code is not in strict mode” check  box is unchecked, and click the “Lint” button.  3. Based on the errors presented, attempt to fix anything that seems like it may be an issue.   When complete, your JavaScript code should look something like this  this is one possible  solution :  $ document .ready function   {   var x = 2,        y = 0;   if  x !== 2  {     y = 3;   }   else {     y = 5;   }   $ "my-element" .hide  .show 1000 ; } ;  4. Run the test again with the new code to ensure it passes the test.  Try This Summary  In this project, you used your knowledge of JSHint to test whether a piece of JavaScript jQuery  code had any potential issues. Upon finding the issues, you were able to correct them and rerun  the test to ensure there were no further issues with the code.   Chapter 12: Advanced Techniques and Further Resources  333  Unit Testing  While alerts, console logs, and browser tools can do quite a bit, sometimes programs become  quite large and it becomes necessary to perform some automated testing to ensure that any  current code is operating as expected and that any new code introduced does not break the  code that is already in place. This can be done using what is known as unit testing.  Unit testing allows you to specify some tests that will be run on the JavaScript jQuery code  you have. These tests can do anything from testing values to testing whether a node was added  to the DOM. To perform unit testing, it is helpful to have a unit testing tool. Some of these are  listed next, with links to further information on each tool so that you can download and use it  if you choose to do so.   ● QUnit  http:  qunitjs.com    This one is highly recommended for unit testing jQuery code, and is used by jQuery,  jQuery Mobile, and jQuery UI for testing. It can also test regular JavaScript code.    ● Jasmine  http:  pivotal.github.io jasmine    ● Mocha  http:  visionmedia.github.io mocha    ● YUI Test http:  developer.yahoo.com yui yuitest   Additional Resources  When you are done with this book, you may find you want to learn more about jQuery or some  of the other topics mentioned in the book.

Learn the fundamentals of jQuery programming in no time. jQuery: A Beginner's Guide starts with the basics--from including the library in an HTML document to element selection, event handling, and CSS style manipulation. Next, it's on to JavaScript and the DOM, animation and effects, the Event object, and form validation. The book then delves into AJAX and plugins and covers more advanced techniques such as debugging and unit testing. Get started with jQuery right away using this fast-paced tutorial
