You	might	have	even	encountered	professionals	who introduced	themselves	as	data	scientists.	Hence,	you	are	wondering,	just	what	is this	emerging	new	area	of	science?	What	types	of	knowledge	and	problem- solving	skills	do	data	scientists	have?	What	types	of	problems	are	solved	by	data scientists	through	Big	Data	tech? After	reading	book,	you	will	have	the	answers	to	these	questions.	In	addition, you	will	begin	to	become	proficient	with	important	industry	terms	and applications	and	tools	in	order	to	prepare	you	for	a	deeper	understanding	of	the other	important	areas	of	Big	Data. Every	day,	our	society	is	creating	about	3	quintillion	bytes	of	data.	You	are probably	wondering	what	3	quintillion	is.	Well,	this	is	3	followed	by	18	zeros. And	that	folks	is	generated	EVERY	DAY.	With	this	massive	stream	of	data,	the need	to	make	sense	of	for	this	becomes	more	crucial	and	quickly	increasing demand	for	Big	Data	understanding.	Business	owners,	large	or	small,	must	have basic	knowledge	in	big	data. 	   Chapter	1.	A	Conundrum	Called	‘Big	Data’ 	 ‘Big	data’	is	one	of	the	latest technology	trends	that	are profoundly	affecting	the	way organizations	utilize	information to	enhance	the	customer experience,	improve	their products	and	services,	create untapped	sources	of	revenue, transform	business	models	and even	efficiently	manage	health care	services.		What	makes	it	a highly	trending	topic	is	the	fact that	the	effective	use	of	big	data almost	always	ends	up	with	significantly	dramatic	results.		Yet,	the	irony	though is	nobody	really	knows	what	‘big	data’	actually	means.																																									 There	is	no	doubt	that	‘big	data’	is	not	just	a	highly	trending	IT	buzzword. Rather,	it	is	a	fast	evolving	concept	in	information	technology	and	data management	that	is	revolutionizing	the	way	companies	conduct	their	businesses. The	sad	part	is,	it	is	also	turning	out	to	be	a	classic	conundrum	because	no	one, not	even	a	group	of	the	best	IT	experts	or	computer	geeks	can	come	up	with	a definitive	explanation	describing	exactly	what	it	is.	They	always	fall	short	of coming	up	with	an	appropriate	description	for	‘big	data’	that	that	is	acceptable	to all.	At	best,	what	most	of	these	computer	experts	could	come	up	with	are roundabout	explanations	and	sporadic	examples	to	describe	it.	Try	asking several	IT	experts	what	‘big	data’	is	and	you	will	get	just	as	many	different answers	as	the	number	of	people	you	ask. What	makes	it	even	more	complicated	and	difficult	to	understand	is	the	fact	that what	is	deemed	as	‘big’	now	may	not	be	that	big	in	the	near	future	due	to	rapid advances	in	software	technology	and	the	data	management	systems	designed	to handle	them.   We	also	cannot	escape	the	fact	that	we	now	live	in	a	digital	universe	where everything	and	anything	we	do	leaves	a	digital	trace	we	call	data.	At	the	center of	this	digital	universe	is	the	World	Wide	Web	from	which	comes	a	deluge	of data	that	floods	our	consciousness	every	single	second.	With	well	over	one trillion	web	pages	 50	billion	of	which	have	already	been	indexed	by	and	are searchable	through	various	major	search	engines ,	the	web	offers	us unparalleled	interconnectivity	which	allows	us	to	interact	with	anyone	and anything	within	a	connected	network	we	happen	to	be	part	of.	Each	one	of	these interactions	generates	data	too	that	is	coursed	through	and	recorded	in	the	web	- adding	up	to	the	‘fuzziness’	of	an	already	fuzzy	concept.	As	a	consequence,	the web	is	continuously	overflowing	with	massive	data	so	huge	that	it	is	almost impossible	to	digest	or	crunch	into	usable	segments	for	practical	applications	–	if they	are	of	any	use	at	all.		This	enormous,	ever	growing	data	that	goes	through and	are	stored	in	the	web	together	with	the	developing	technologies	designed	to handle	it	is	what	is	collectively	referred	to	as	‘big	data’. 	   So,	What	Does	Big	Data	Look	Like? If	you	want	to	have an	idea	on	what ‘big	data’	really	looks	like	or	how	massive	it	truly is,	try	to	visualize	the	following	statistics	if	you can	-	without	getting	dizzy.	Think	of	the	web which	currently	covers	more	than	100	million	domains	and	is	still	growing	at	the rate	of	20,000	new	domains	every	single	day. The	data	that	comes	from	these	domains	is	so	massive	and	mind	boggling	that	it is	practically	immeasurable	much	less	manageable	by	any	conventional	data management	and	retrieval	methods	that	are	available	today.	And	that	is	only	for our	starters.	Add	to	this	the	300	million	daily	Facebook	posts,	60	million	daily Facebook	updates,	and	250	million	daily	tweets	coming	from	more	than	900 million	combined	Facebook	and	Tweeter	users	and	for	sure	your	imagination	is going	to	go	through	the	roof.	Don’t	forget	to	include	the	voluminous	data coming	from	over	six	billion	smart	phones	currently	in	use	today	which continually	access	the	internet	to	do	business	online,	to	post	status	updates	on social	media,	send	out	tweets,	and	many	other	digital	transactions.	Remember, approximately	one	billion	of	these	smart	phones	are	GPS	enabled	which	means they	are	constantly	connected	to	the	internet	and	therefore,	they	are	continuously leaving	behind	their	digital	trails	which	is	adding	more	data	to	the	already burgeoning	bulk	of	information	already	stored	in	millions	of	servers	that	span the	internet. And	if	your	imagination	still	serves	you	right	at	this	point,	try	contemplating	on the	more	than	thirty	billion	Point	Of	Sales	transactions	per	year	that	are	coursed through	electronically-connected	POS	devices.	If	you	are	still	up	to	it,	why	not also	go	over	the	more	than	10,000	credit	card	payments	being	done	online	or through	other	connected	devices	every	single	second.	The	sheer	volume	alone	of the	combined	torrential	data	that	envelops	us	unceasingly	is	amazingly unbelievable.	“Mind	boggling”	is	an	understatement.	Stupefying	would	be	more appropriate.   Don’t blink  now	but	the	‘big	data’	that	had	been accumulated	by	the	web	for	the	past	five years	 since	2010 	and	are	now	stored	in millions	of	servers	scattered	all	over	the globe	far	exceeds	all	of	the	prior	data	that had	been	produced	and	recorded	throughout the	whole	history	of	mankind.	The	‘big	data’	we	refer	to	includes	anything	and everything	that	has	been	fed	into	big	data	systems	such	as	social	network chatters,	content	of	web	pages,	GPS	trails,	financial	market	data,	online	banking transactions,	streaming	music	and	videos,	podcasts,	satellite	imagery,	etc.	It	is estimated	that	over	2.5	quintillion	bytes	of	data	 2.5	x	1018 	is	created	by	us every	day.	This	massive	flood	of	data	which	we	collectively	call	as	‘big	data’ just	keeps	on	getting	bigger	and	bigger	through	time.	Experts	estimate	that	its volume	will	reach	35	zetta	bytes	 35	x	1021 	by	2020. In	essence,	if	and	when	data	sets	grow	extremely	big	or	become	excessively	too complex	for	traditional	data	management	tools	to	handle,	it	is	considered	as	'Big Data'.	The	problem	is,	there	is	no	common	set	ceiling	or	acceptable	upper threshold	level	beyond	which	the	bulk	of	information	starts	to	be	classified	as big	data.	In	practice,	what	most	companies	normally	do	is	to	consider	as	big	data those	which	have	outgrown	their	own	respective	database	management	tools. Big	Data,	in	such	case,	is	the	enormous	data	which	they	can	no	longer	handle either	because	it	is	too	massive,	too	complex,	or	both.	This	means	the	ceiling varies	from	one	company	to	the	other.	In	other	words,	different	companies	have different	upper	threshold	limits	to	determine	what	constitutes	big	data.	Almost always,	the	ceiling	is	determined	by	how	much	data	their	respective	database management	tools	are	able	to	handle	at	any	given	time.	That’s	probably	one	of the	reasons	why	the	definition	of	‘big	data’	is	so	fuzzy.   The	Purpose	and	Value	of	‘Big	Data’ Just	as	fuzzy	and	nebulous	as	its	definition,	the purpose	or	value	of	Big	Data	also	appears	to	be unclear	to	many	entrepreneurs.		In	fact,	many	of them	are	still	groping	in	the	dark	looking	for answers	to	such	questions	as	‘why’	and	‘how’	to use	‘big	data’	to	grow	their	businesses.	 If	we	are	to	take our	cue	from	a poll	conducted	by	Digitalist	Magazine	among	the 300	participants	to	the	Sapphire	Now	2014	event held	at	Orlando,	Florida,	it	appears	that	about 82%	of	companies	have	started	to	embrace	Big Data	as	a	critical	component	to	achieving	their strategic	objectives.	But	despite	the	fact	that	60%	of	them	have	started	digging into	big	data,	only	3%	has	gained	the	maturity	or	have	acquired	sufficient knowledge	and	resources	to	sift	through	and	manage	such	massive	information. Apparently,	the	rest	continue	to	grope	in	the	dark. It	is	therefore	quite	a	wonder	that	despite	being	constantly	on	the	lookout	for new	ways	to	build	and	maintain	a	competitive	edge	and	despite	relentlessly seeking	new	and	innovative	products	and	services	to	increase	profitability,	most companies	still	miss	out	on	the	many	opportunities	‘big	data’	has	to	offer.	For whatever	reason	they	may	have,	they	stop	short	of	laying	down	the	necessary ground	work	for	them	to	start	managing	and	digging	into	‘big	data’	to	extract new	insights	and	create	new	value	as	well	as	discover	ways	to	stay	ahead	of	their competitors. For	hidden	deep	within	the	torrent	of	big	data	information	stream	is	a	wealth	of useful	knowledge	and	valuable	behavioral	and	market	patterns	that	can	be	used by	companies	 big	or	small 	to	fuel	their	growth	and	profitability	–	simply waiting	to	be	tapped.		However,	such	valuable	information	have	to	be	'mined' and	‘refined’	first	before	they	can	be	put	into	good	use	-	much	like	drilling	for oil	that	is		buried	underground. Similar	to	oil	which	has	to	be	drilled	and	refined	first	before	you	can	harness	its	 awesome	power	to	the	hilt,	‘big	data’	users	have	to	dig	deep,	sift	through,	and   analyze	the	layers	upon	layers	of	data	sets	that	makes	up	big	data	before	they	can extract	usable	sets	that	has	specific	value	to	them.  In	other	words,	like	oil,	big	data	becomes	more valuable	only	after	it	is	‘mined’,	processed,	and analyzed	for	pertinent	data	that	can	be	used	to create	new	values.	This	cumbersome	process	is called	big	data	analytics.	Analytics	is	what	gives big	data	its	shine	and	makes	it	usable	for application	to	specific	cases.	To	make	the	story short,	big	data	goes	hand	in	hand	with	analytics. Without	analytics,	big	data	is	nothing	more	than	a bunch	of	meaningless	digital	trash. The traditional way	of	processing	big	data	however,	used	to	be	a tough	and	expensive	task	to	tackle.	It	involves analyzing	massive	volumes	of	data	which  traditional	analytics	and	conventional	business	intelligence	solutions	can't handle.	It	requires	the	use	of	equally	massive	computer	hardware	and	the	most sophisticated	data	management	software	designed	primarily	to	handle	such enormous	and	complicated	information. The	giant	corporations	who	started	digging	into	big	data	ahead	of	everybody	else had	to	spend	fortunes	on	expensive	hardware	and	ground	breaking	data management	software	to	be	able	do	it	–	albeit,	with	a	great	deal	of	success	at that.	Their	pioneering	efforts	revealed	new	insights	that	were	buried	deep	in	the maze	of	information	clogging	the	internet	servers	and	which	they	were	able	to retrieve	and	use	to	great	advantage.	For	example,	after	analyzing	geographical and	social	data	and	after	scrutinizing	every	business	transaction,	they	discovered a	new	marketing	factor	called	‘peer	influence’	which	played	an	important	role	in shaping	shopping	preferences.	This	discovery	allowed	them	to	establish	specific market	needs	and	segments	without	the	need	to	conduct	tedious	product samplings	thus,	blazing	the	trail	for	data	driven	marketing. All	this	while,	the	not-so-well-resourced	companies	could	only	watch	in	awe	– sidelined	by	the	prohibitive	cost	of	processing	big	data.	The	good	news	though	is this	will	not	be	for	long	because	there	is	now	affordable	commodity	hardware   which	the	not-so-well-resourced	can	use	to	start	their	own	big	data	projects. There	are	also	the	cloud	architectures	and	open	source	software	which tremendously	cut	the	cost	of	big	data	processing	making	it	highly	feasible	even for	startup	companies	to	tap	into	the	huge	potential	of	big	data	by	simply subscribing	to	cloud	services	for	server	time. At	this	point,	there	is	only	one	thing	that	is	clear	-	every	enterprise	are	left	with no	choice	but	to	embrace	the	concept	of	big	data	and	understand	its	implication to	their	business.	They	have	to	realize	that	data	driven	marketing	and	data	driven product	innovation	is	now	the	new	norm.   How	Big	Data	Changes	Everything Big	Data	is	a	kind	of	supercomputing	that	can	be	used	by	governments	and businesses,	which	will	make	it	doable	to	keep	track	of	pandemic	in	real	time, guess	where	the	next	terrorist	attack	will	happen,	improve	efficiency	of restaurant	chains,	project	voting	patterns	on	elections,	and	predict	the	volatility of	financial	markets	while	they	are	happening. Hence,	many	of	the	seemingly	unrelated	yet	diverse	will	be	integrated	into	big data	network.	Similar	to	any	powerful	tech,	when	used	properly	and	effectively for	the	good,	Big	Data	could	push	the	mankind	towards	many	possibilities.	But if	used	with	bad	intentions,	the	risks	could	be	very	high	and	could	even	be damaging. The	need	to	get	big	data	is	immediate	for	different	organizations.	If	a	malevolent organization	gets	the	tech	first,	then	the	rest	of	the	world	could	be	at	risk.	If	a terrorist	organization	secured	the	tech	first	before	the	CIA,	the	security	of	the USA	could	be	compromised. The	resolutions	will	need	business	establishments	to	be	more	creative	at different	levels	including	organizational,	financial,	and	technical.	If	the	cold	war in	the	1950s	was	all	about	getting	the	arms,	today,	Big	Data	is	the	arms	race. 	   Enterprise	Supercomputing Trends	in	the	world	of	supercomputing	are	in	some	ways	similar	to	those	of	the fashion	industry.	Even	if	you	wait	long	enough,	you	can	have	the	chance	to	wear it	again.	Most	of	the	tech	used	in	Big	Data	have	been	used	in	different	industries for	many	years,	such	as	distributed	file	systems,	parallel	processing,	and clustering. Enterprise	supercomputing	was	developed	by	online	companies	with	worldwide operations	that	require	the	processing	of	exponentially	growing	numbers	of	users and	their	profiles	 Yahoo!,	Google,	and	Facebook .	But	they	need	to	do	this	as fast	as	they	can	without	spending	too	much	money.	This	is	enterprise supercomputing	known	as	Big	Data. Big	Data	could	cause	disruptive	changes	to	organizations,	and	can	reach	far beyond	online	communities	to	the	social	media	platforms	that	spans	and connects	the	globe.	Big	Data	is	not	just	a	fad.	It	is	a	crucial	aspect	of	modern tech	that	will	be	used	for	generations	to	come. Big	data	computing	is	actually	not	a	new	technology.	Since	the	beginning	of time,	predicting	the	weather	has	been	a	crucial	big	data	concern,	when	weather models	are	processed	using	one	supercomputer,	which	can	occupy	a	whole gymnasium	and	integrated	with	then-fast	processing	units	with	costly	memory. Software	during	the	1970s	was	very	crude,	so	most	of	the	performance	during that	time	was	credited	due	to	the	innovative	engineering	of	the	hardware component. Software	technology	had	improved	in	the	1990s	leading	to	the	improved	setup where	programs	processed	on	one	huge	supercomputer	can	be	partitioned	into smaller	programs	that	are	running	simultaneously	on	several	workstations.	Once all	the	programs	are	done	processing,	the	results	will	be	collated	and	analyzed	to forecast	the	weather	for	several	weeks. But	even	during	the	1990s,	the	computer	simulators	need	about	15	days	to calculate	and	project	the	weather	for	a	week.	Of	course,	it	doesn’t	help	people	to know	that	it	was	cloudy	last	week.	Nowadays,	the	parallel	computer	simulations for	weather	prediction	for	the	whole	week	could	be	completed	in	a	matter	of hours. In	reality,	these	supercomputers	cannot	predict	the	weather.	Instead,	they	are	just   trying	to	simulate	and	forecast	its	behavior.	Through	human	analysis,	the weather	could	be	predicted.	Hence,	supercomputers	alone	cannot	process	Big Data	and	make	sense	of	it. Many	weather	forecasting	agencies	use	different	simulators	with	varying strengths.	Computer	simulators	that	are	good	at	forecasting	where	a	hurricane will	fall	in	New	York	are	not	that	accurate	in	forecasting	how	the	humidity	level could	affect	the	air	operations	at	Atlanta	International	Airport. Weather	forecasters	in	every	region	study	the	results	of	several	simulations	with various	sets	of	initial	data.	They	not	only	pore	over	actual	output	from	weather agencies,	but	they	also	look	at	different	instruments	such	as	the	doppler	radar. Even	though	there	are	tons	of	data	involved,	weather	simulation	is	not categorized	as	Big	Data,	because	there	is	a	lot	of	computing	required.	Scientific computing	problems	 usually	in	engineering	and	meteorology 	are	also	regarded as	scientific	supercomputing	or	high-performance	computing	or	HPC. Early	electronic	computers	are	designed	to	perform	scientific	computing,	such	as deciphering	codes	or	calculating	missile	trajectories,	which	all	involves	working on	mathematical	problems	using	millions	of	equations.	Scientific	calculations can	also	solve	equations	for	non-scientific	problems	like	in	rendering	animated movies. Big	Data	is	regarded	as	the	enterprise	equivalent	of	HPC	that	is	also	known	as the	enterprise	supercomputing	or	high-performance	commercial	computing.	Big Data	can	also	resolve	huge	computing	problems,	but	this	is	more	about discovering	simulations	and	less	about	equations. During	the	early	1960s,	financial	organizations	such	as	banks	and	lending	firms used	enterprise	computers	to	automate	accounts	and	manage	their	credit	card ventures.	Nowadays,	online	businesses	such	as	eBay,	Amazon,	and	even	large retailers	are	using	enterprise	supercomputing	in	order	to	find	solutions	for numerous	business	problems	that	they	encounter.	However,	enterprise supercomputing	can	be	used	for	much	more	than	studying	customer	attrition, managing	subscribers,	or	discovering	idle	accounts. 	 Big	Data	and	Hadoop   Hadoop	is	regarded	as	the	first	enterprise	supercomputing	software	platform, which	works	at	scale	and	is	quite	affordable.	It	exploits	the	easy	trick	of parallelism	that	is	already	in	use	in	high	performance	computing	industry. Yahoo!	developed	this	software	in	order	to	find	a	specific	solution	for	a	problem, but	they	immediately	realized	that	this	software	has	the	ability	to	solve	other computer	problems. Even	though	the	fortunes	of	Yahoo!	changed	drastically,	it	has	made	a	large contribution	to	the	incubation	of	Facebook,	Google,	and	big	data. Yahoo!	originally	developed	Hadoop	to	easily	process	the	flood	of	clickstream data	received	by	the	search	engine.	Click	stream	refers	to	the	history	of	links clicked	by	the	users.	Because	it	could	be	monetized	to	potential	advertisers, analyzing	the	data	for	clickstream	from	thousands	of	Yahoo!	servers	needed	a huge	scalable	database,	which	was	cost-effective	to	create	and	run. The	early	search	engine	company	discovered	that	many	commercial	solutions during	that	time	were	either	very	expensive	or	entirely	not	capable	of	scaling such	huge	data.	Hence,	Yahoo!	had	to	develop	the	software	from	scratch,	and	so DIY	enterprise	supercomputing	began. Similar	to	Linux,	Hadoop	is	designed	as	an	open-source	software	tech.	Just	as Linux	led	to	the	commodity	clouds	and	clusters	in	HPC,	Hadoop	has	developed a	big	data	network	of	disruptive	possibilities,	new	startups,	old	vendors,	and	new products. Hadoop	was	created	as	portable	software;	it	can	be	operated	using	other platforms	aside	from	Linux.	The	power	to	run	open	source	software	similar	to Hadoop	on	a	Microsoft	OS	is	a	crucial	and	a	success	for	the	open	source community,	which	was	a	huge	milestone	during	that	time.		 Yahoo!	and	Big	Data Knowing	the	history	of	Yahoo	is	crucial	in	understanding	the	history	of	Big Data,	because	Yahoo	was	the	first	company	to	operate	at	such	massive	scale. Dave	Filo	and	Jerry	Yang	began	Yahoo!	as	a	tech	project	in	order	to	index	the internet.	But	as	they	work	on,	they	realized	that	traditional	indexing	strategies cannot	be	used	with	the	explosion	of	content	that	should	be	indexed. Even	before	the	creation	of	Hadoop,	Yahoo!	had	the	need	for	a	computer platform,	which	can	take	the	same	amount	of	time	to	develop	the	web	index   regardless	of	the	growth	rate	of	internet	content.	The	creators	realized	that	there is	a	need	to	use	the	parallelism	tactic	from	the	high	power	computing	world	for the	project	to	become	scalable	and	then	the	computing	grid	of	Yahoo!	became the	cluster	network	that	Hadoop	was	based	on. Similar	to	the	importance	of	Hadoop	was	Yahoo!’s	innovation	in	restructuring their	Operations	and	Engineering	teams	in	order	to	support	network	platforms	of this	scale.	The	experience	of	Yahoo	in	operating	a	large-scale	computing platform,	which	spread	across	several	locations	resulted	to	the	re-invention	of the	Information	Technology	Department. Complicated	platforms	had	to	be	developed	initially	and	deployed	by	small teams.	Running	an	organization	to	scale	up	in	order	to	provide	support	to	these platforms	is	an	altogether	separate	matter.	However,	reinventing	the	IT department	is	just	as	important	as	getting	the	software	and	hardware	to	scale. Similar	to	many	corporate	departments	from	Sales	to	HR,	IT	firms conventionally	attain	scalability	by	way	of	centralizing	the	process.	By	having	a dedicated	team	of	IT	experts	managing	a	thousand	storage	databases	is	more cost-effective	compared	to	compensating	the	salaries	for	a	large	team.	However, Storage	Admins	usually	don’t	have	a	working	know-how	of	the	numerous	apps on	these	arrays. Centralization	will	exchange	the	working	knowledge	of	the	generalist	for expertise	of	the	subject	matter	as	well	as	cost	efficiency.	Businesses	are	now realizing	the	unintended	risks	of	exchanges	made	several	years	ago,	which created	silos,	which	will	inhibit	their	capacity	to	use	big	data. Conventional	IT	firms	divide	expertise	and	responsibilities	that	often	constrain collaboration	among	and	between	teams.	Minor	glitches	because	of miscommunications	could	be	acceptable	on	a	few	minor	email	servers,	but	even a	small	glitch	in	producing	supercomputers	may	cost	businesses	to	lose	money. Even	a	small	margin	of	error	could	result	to	a	large	difference.	In	the	Big	Data world,	100	Terabytes	is	just	a	Small	Data,	but	1%	error	in	100	TB	is	1	Million MB.	Detecting	and	resolving	errors	at	this	massive	scale	could	consume	many hours. Yahoo!	adopted	the	strategy	used	by	HPC	community	for	more	than	two decades.	Yahoovians	learned	that	specialized	teams	with	a	working	knowledge   of	the	whole	platform	can	work	best.	Data	silos	and	responsibility	become obstacles	in	either	commercial	supercomputing	and	scientific	supercomputing. Online-scale	computing	silos	work	because	early	adopters	learned	new	insights: supercomputers	are	finely	tuned	platforms	with	numerous	interdependent	parts and	they	don’t	run	as	processing	silos.	But	in	the	1980s,	people	view	computers as	a	machine	with	interdependent	functionality	layers. This	paradigm	was	easier	to	understand,	but	with	exponentially	increasing sophisticated	platforms,	the	layer	paradigm	started	to	cover	the	underlying sophistication,	which	impeded	or	even	avoided	effective	triage	of	performance and	reliability	concerns. Similar	to	a	Boeing	747,	platforms	for	supercomputing	should	be	interpreted	as	a whole	collection	of	technologies	or	the	manageability	or	efficiency	could	be affected. 	  	   Supercomputer	Platforms In	the	early	stages	of	computer	history,	systems	are	considered	as	platforms	- these	are	called	as	mainframes	and	usually	they	are	regarded	as	mainframes	and are	produced	by	companies	that	also	supplies	specialized	teams	of	engineers who	closely	work	with	their	customers	to	make	certain	that	the	platform	can function	according	to	its	design. This	method	was	effective	so	long	as	you	take	satisfaction	as	a	customer	of	IBM. But	when	IBM	started	to	make	some	changes	in	the	1960s,	other	companies provided	more	options	and	better	prices.	However,	this	has	resulted	to partitioning	of	industry	silos. Nowadays,	enterprises	that	are	still	dominating	their	silo	still	have	the	tendency to	behave	like	a	monopoly	so	long	as	they	can	get	away	with	it.	When	storage, server,	and	database	companies	started	to	proliferate,	IT	firms	mimic	this alignment	with	their	relative	groups	of	storage,	server,	and	database	specialists. But	in	order	to	effectively	stand	up	a	big	data	cluster,	each	member	who	is working	on	the	cluster	should	be	organizationally	and	physically	present.	The required	collaborative	work	for	effective	cluster	deployments	at	this	scale	could be	difficult	to	achieve	in	a	subsequent	level	of	a	silo. If	your	business	likes	to	embrace	big	data	or	come	together	in	that	magical	place where	Big	Data	Works	in	the	Cloud,	the	IT	department	should	reorganize	some silos	and	study	the	platform	well. But	far	from	reality,	many	business	organizations	cannot	easily	handle	such changes,	especially	if	the	change	is	too	fast.	Disruption	and	chaos	have	been constants	in	the	industry,	but	were	always	in	close	coordination	with	innovation and	possibility.	For	businesses,	which	are	willing	to	embrace	this	tech,	Big	Data can	be	a	stream	of	new	ideas	as	well	as	enterprise	opportunities. 	 Big	Data	Bang As	the	network	of	Big	Data	evolves	over	the	next	decades,	it	will	surely overwhelm	both	customers	and	vendors	in	various	ways. 1.	The	impact	to	the	silo	mindset,	both	in	the	industry	and	the	organization	will   be	an	important	milestone	of	big	data. 2.	The	IT	industry	will	be	bombarded	by	the	new	tech	of	big	data,	since	most	of the	products	before	the	creation	of	Hadoop	are	not	functioning	at	all.	Big	Data software	and	hardware	is	many	times	faster	compared	to	existing	business-scale products	and	also	a	lot	cheaper. 3.	Tech	as	disruptive	and	new	as	Big	Data	is	usually	not	easily	welcomed	in	an established	IT	organization	because	their	organizational	mandate	compels	them to	focus	on	minimizing	OPEX	and	not	encourage	innovation,	which	forces	IT	to be	the	devil’s	advocate	of	Big	Data. 4.	It	companies	will	be	disrupted	by	the	new	generation	that	will	come	after those	who	have	focused	working	on	EMC,	Microsoft,	and	Oracle.	Big	Data	is considered	as	the	most	important	force	in	the	IT	industry	today	since	the introduction	of	the	relational	database. 5.	In	working	with	Big	Data,	programmers	and	data	scientists	are	required	to	set things	up	for	a	better	understanding	of	how	the	data	will	flow	beneath.	This includes	the	introduction	as	well	as	the	reintroduction	to	the	computing	platform, which	makes	it	possible.	This	could	be	way	beyond	their	comfort	zones	if	they are	entrenched	inside	silos.	IT	professionals	who	are	open	in	learning	new	ways of	thinking,	working,	and	collaborating	will	prosper,	and	this	prosperity	could equate	to	efficiency. 6.	Privacy	and	civil	liberties	could	be	compromised	as	technology	advancements will	make	it	less	expensive	for	any	organization	 public	or	private 	to	study	data patterns	as	well	as	individual	behavior	of	anyone	who	accesses	the	internet. 	 Great	Possibilities	with	Big	Data Nowadays,	Big	Data	is	not	just	for	social	networking	or	machine-generated online	logs.	Enterprises	and	agencies	can	seek	answers	to	questions,	which	they may	never	have	the	capacity	to	ask	and	Big	Data	could	help	in	identifying	such questions. For	example,	car	producers	can	now	access	their	worldwide	parts	inventory across	numerous	plants	and	also	acquire	tons	of	data	 usually	in	petabytes  coming	from	the	sensors	that	can	be	installed	in	the	cars	they	have   manufactured. Other	enterprises	can	now	analyze	and	process	tons	of	data	while	they	are	still collecting	it	on	the	field.	For	instance,	prospecting	for	gold	reserves	will	involve seismic	sensors	in	the	field	acquiring	tons	of	data	that	could	be	sent	to	HQ	and analyzed	within	minutes. In	the	past,	this	data	should	be	taken	back	to	a	costly	data	center,	and	transferred to	high-powered	supercomputers	–	this	process	takes	a	lot	of	time.	Today,	a Hadoop	cluster	distributed	all	over	seismic	trucks	parked	in	a	vacant	lot	could still	do	the	task	within	hours,	and	find	patterns	to	know	the	prospecting	route	for the	next	day. In	the	field	of	agriculture,	farmers	can	use	hundreds	of	farm	sensors	that	could transmit	data	back	to	the	Hadoop	cluster	installed	in	a	bard	in	order	to	monitor the	growth	of	the	crops. Government	agencies	are	also	using	Hadoop	clusters	because	these	are	more affordable.	For	instance,	the	CDC	and	the	WHO	are	now	using	Big	Data	to	track the	spread	of	pandemic	such	as	SARS	or	H1N1	as	they	happen. Even	though	Big	Data	allows	it	to	process	large	data	sets,	the	process	could	be fast,	thanks	to	parallelism.	Hadoop	could	also	be	used	for	data	sets,	which	are not	considered	as	Big	Data.	The	small	Hadoop	cluster	can	be	considered	as	an artificial	retina. Regardless	of	the	form	of	data	transmission,	the	data	should	still	be	collected into	a	cost-effective	reservoir,	so	that	the	business	or	enterprise	could	fully realize	these	possibilities. The	data	reservoir	cannot	be	considered	as	another	drag-and-drop	business warehouse.	The	data	stored	in	the	reservoir,	similar	to	the	fresh	water	stored	in water	reservoir	should	be	used	to	sustain	the	operations	of	the	business.   	   Chapter	2.	Understanding	Big	Data	Better  Big data is	not	a	single	entity.	Rather,	it	is	a synthesis	of	several	data-management technologies	that	have	evolved	over	time. Big	data	is	what	allows	businesses	the ability	to	store,	analyze,	and	exploit massive	amounts	of	data	with	great	ease and	on	real	time	to	gain	deeper	market insights	and	create	new	value	that	will  benefit	the	organization.	But,	big	data	has	to	be	managed	well	before	it	can	be utilized	to	provide	the	most	appropriate	solution	that	meets	specific	business requirements	of	an	enterprise.	And,	the	key	to	managing	big	data	well	is	by having	a	clear	understanding	of	what	it	truly	is. Unfortunately,	each	time	we	attempt	to	define	the	term	big	data,	our	minds almost	always	end	up	swirling	in	confusion.	It	is	not	only	the	enormity	of	big data	that	poses	a	challenge	and	makes	it	difficult	to	understand	but	also	the seemingly	endless	variety	of	tasks	involved	in	processing	it	including	analysis, capturing	information,	curating	data	sets,	searching	for	and	filtering	relevant information,	sharing	data	with	others,	providing	for	sufficient	data	storage, efficient	data	transfer,	visualization,	and	most	important	of	all	ensuring	privacy of	information. Without	a	clear	understanding	of	what	big	data	is,	we	won’t	be	able	to	harness its	full	potential	much	less	use	it	to	our	advantage.	If	we	want	to	tap	the	full potential	of	big	data,	we	are	left	with	no	choice	but	to	continue	seeking	for	a truly	definitive	explanation	of	what	it	really	is	-	no	matter	how	overwhelming the	task	may	seem.	We	need	to	discover	novel	ways	to	dig	up	relevant information	embedded	deep	in	its	vast	realm	of	information	in	order	to	discover useful	insights	and	create	innovative	products	and	services	of	significant	value. Let	me	point	out	that	data	becomes	valuable	only	if	it	leads	to	the	creation	of significant	business	solutions.	We	need	to	create	meaningful	value	from	data before	we	can	attach	a	monetary	value	to	it.	In	other	words,	to	have	a	more stable	and	sounder	basis	for	big	data	valuation,	we	have	to	link	the	data’s	value   to	its	potential	role	in	supporting	business	decisions	that	produce	positive	results.   How	To	Value	Data:	4	Measurable	Characteristics	Of	Big	Data The	best	way	to	get	a	head	start	on this	is	to	quantify	and	qualify	in certain	terms	the	value	of	the different	data	sets	making	up	big data.	There	are	actually	4 measurable	characteristics	of	big data	we	can	use	to	define	and	put measurable	value	to	it	namely volume,	velocity,	variety,	and veracity.	These	characteristics	are	what	IBM	termed	as	the	four	V’s	of	big	data.  Volume	Based	Value When	we	talk	about	the	volume of	big	data,	we	are	talking	about	Zettabytes	 1	Zettabyte	=	1	sextillion	bytes	or	1 x	1021	bytes 	of	information	possibly	even	Brontobytes	 1	Brontobyte=	1	x	1027 bytes 	in	the	near	term.	The	amount	of	information	is	simply	too	large	for traditional	database	technology	to	store	much	less	analyze.		As	per	latest estimates,	2.3	trillion	gigabytes	of	new	data	is	created	every	single	day.	It	is	just a	matter	of	time	before	the	amount	of	data	that	we	create	per	minute	will	equal all	the	data	produced	from	the	beginning	of	time	till	the	present. Because	of	its	immense	volume,	storage	poses	the	biggest	and	the	most immediate	challenge	that	is	why	the	direction	of	big	data	technology	today	is	to develop	huge	data	tools	that	uses	a	distributed	system	where	data	is	stored	and analyze	across	a	network	of	interconnected	databases	located	across	the	globe. This	scalable	data	storage	setup	coupled	with	a	distributed	approach	to	querying will	allow	businesses	to	have	a	360-degree	view	of	their	customers	as	well	as allow	them	access	to	much	more	historical	data	than	usual	thus	giving	businesses more	and	deeper	market	insights.	Needless	to	say,	having	more	data	to	base decision	making	is	better	than	creating	marketing	models	based	on	a	few,	limited data. Velocity	Based	Value Big	Data	Velocity	is	about	the	speed	by	which	data	streams	into	our	own networks	in	real	time	coming	from	all	possible	sources	including	business   processes,	other	networks,	digitally	connected	machines,	as	well	as	the streaming	data	that	is	created	every	time	people	use	their	mobile	devices,	or	each time	they	interact	with	social	media	sites,	and	the	like.	This	flow	of	data	is	not only	massive	but	also	continuous	which	in	effect	puts	big	data	in	a	state	of perpetual	flux.	Making	it	possible	for	big	data	users	to	access	and	analyze information	in	real-time	is	where	the	real	value	of	big	data	velocity	lay.	It	means researchers	and	businesses	are	able	to	make	valuable	timely	decisions	that provide	them	with	strategic	competitive	advantages	and	improve	their	bottom line	 ROI 	tremendously. The	more	real	time	customer	data	you	absorbed	in	your	big-data	management tool	and	the	more	queries,	reports,	dashboards,	and	customers’	interaction	that gets	recorded	in	your	data	base,	the	better	your	chances	are	in	making	the	right decision	at	the	right	time.	With	such	timely	information,	you	will	be	able	to develop	excellent	customer	relationship	and	achieve	management	objectives with	great	ease. Variety	Based	Value The	data	sets	that	make	up	big	data	are	varied	and	include	both	structured	and unstructured	data.	In	essence,	big	data	is	a	mixture	of	unstructured	and	multi- structured	data	which	together	compose	the	bulk	of	information	contained therein.	This	varied	customer	data	includes	information	coming	from	the Customer	Relations	Management	systems;	feedbacks,	reactions,	and	interactions from	social	media;	call-center	logs,	etc.	With	varied	customer	data	as	your	basis, you	will	be	able	to	paint	more	refined	customer	profiles,	determine	client	desires and	preferences,	etc.	which	means	you	will	be	better-informed	in	making business	decisions	and	do	a	better	job	in	engaging	customers. To	come	up	with	clear	pictures	of	customer	profiles	and	preferences,	therefore, you	must	not	limit	your	big	data	analytics	only	to	digital	inputs	such	as	social network	interactions	and	web	behavior.	You	must	also	include	traditional	data such	as	those	coming	from	your	own	business	transactions,	financial	records, call	center	logs,	point-of-sale	records,	and	such	other	channels	of	interaction	you engage	with.	Digital	data	inputs	are	growing	at	a	tremendous	rate	and	may totally	overwhelm	traditional	data	but	that	is	not	reason	enough	to	exclude traditional	data	from	your	data	sets.	They	are	part	and	parcel	of	big	data analytics	and	contribute	a	lot	to	creating	a	truly	representative	market	profile	of your	targeted	customer	base.   	   What	is	Structured	Data? Structured	data	refers	to	any	data that	are	seamlessly	contained	in relational	databases	and spreadsheets.	You	can	liken	it	to arranging	data	sets	in	neat	little boxes.	It	involves	having	a	tightly organized	structure	where	the	data set	resides	in	a	fixed	field contained	in	a	record	or	file.	It	is so	well	organized	that	that	they	are easily	searchable	by	even	the simplest	search	engine	algorithm. It	can	also	be	entered,	stored,	analyzed and	queried	in	relational	databases	with great	ease.	Samples	of	structured	data	include	numeric,	currency,	alphabetic, name,	data,	address,	etc. Managing	structured	data	requires	the	use	of	a	programming	language	originally developed	by	IBM	in	the	70’s	called	Structured	Query	Language	 more popularly	known	by	its	acronym	SQL .		Structured	data	was	a	welcome alternative	to	the	traditional	paper-based	data	management	systems	which	is highly	unstructured	and	too	cumbersome	to	manage.	And	since	limited	storage capacity	remained	a	problem,	structured	data	still	had	to	be	augmented	by	paper or	microfilm	storage.   What	is	Unstructured	Data? Unstructured	data	refers	to	data	sets	that	are	text-heavy	and	are	not	organized into	specific	fields.	Because	of	this,	traditional	databases	or	data	models	have difficulty	interpreting	them.	Examples	of	unstructured	data	include	Metadata, photos	and	graphic	images,	webpages,	PDF	files,	wikis	and	word	processing documents,	streaming	instrument	data,	blog	entries,	videos,	emails,	Twitter tweets,	and	other	social	media	posts.	Locating	unstructured	data	requires	the	use of	semantic	search	algorithm. Veracity	Based	Value Big	Data	Veracity	is	the	term	that	describes	the	process	of	eliminating	any abnormality	in	the	data	being	absorbed	by	any	big	data	system.	This	includes biases,	‘noise’	or	irrelevant	data	and	those	that	are	being	mined	which	has nothing	to	do	with	the	problem	for	which	a	solution	is	being	sought.	Big	data veracity	actually	poses	a	bigger	challenge	than	volume	and	velocity	when	it comes	to	analytics.	You	have	to	clean	incoming	data	and	prevent	‘dirty’	and uncertain,	imprecise	data	from	accumulating	in	your	big	data	system. By	default,	current	big	data	systems	accept	enormous	amounts	of	both	structured and	unstructured	data	at	great	speed.	And,	since	unstructured	data	like	social media	data	contains	a	great	deal	of	uncertain	and	imprecise	data,	we	need	to filter	it	to	keep	our	data	clean	and	unpolluted.	For	this,	we	may	need	some	help. However,	it	would	be	highly	unreasonable	to	spend	huge	amount	of	human capital	for	data	preparation	alone.	The	sad	part	is,	organizations	have	no	recourse but	to	absorb	both	structured	and	unstructured	data	along	with	its	imperfections into	their	big	data	systems	and	then	prepare	the	data	for	their	use	by	filtering	out the	noise	and	the	imprecise. Tools	meant	to	automate	data	preparation,	cleansing,	and	filtering	are	already	in the	works	but	it	may	still	take	a	while	before	they	are	released	for	general	use.	In the	meantime,	it	may	be	easier	and	more	prudent	to	devise	a	Data	Veracity scoring	and	ranking	system	for	the	valuation	of	data	sets	to	minimize	if	not eliminate	the	chances	of	making	business	decisions	based	on	uncertain	and imprecise	data. 	 In	Summary   It	is	the	combination	of	these	factors,	high-volume,	high-velocity,	high-variety and	veracity	that	makes	up	what	we	now	call	as	Big	Data.		There	are	also	data management	platforms	and	data	management	solutions	which	supply	the	tools, methodology	and	the	technology	needed	to	capture,	curate,	store	and	search &	analyze	big	data	all	of	which	are	designed	to	create	new	value,	find correlations,	discover	new	insights	and	trends	as	well	as	reveal	relationships	that were	previously	unknown	or	unavailable.  You	have	to	realize	that	data	hardly	present	itself	already	in	perfect	form	and neatly	ordered	and	just	waiting	to	be	processed	by	big	data	analytics.	Instead,	the more	common	scenario	you	can	expect	for	big	data	systems	is	the	collection	of data	from	diverse	sources	which	more	often	than	not	do	not	fit	into	neat relational	structures.	Most	of	the	information	that	flows	in	to	big	data	systems	is raw	data,	meaning	they	are	not	ready	for	integration	into	an	application. The	logical	approach	to	using	big	data	therefore	is	to	process	unstructured	data and	draw	out	or	create	ordered	meaning	from	it	that	can	be	used	as	a	structured input	to	an	application	or	for	whatever	valuable	solution	it	may	serve	man. Take	note,	however,	that	once	you	process	big	data	and	move	it	from	source	data to	processed	application	data,	there	will	be	some	loss	of	information	that	will occur.	And	once	you	lose	the	source	data	there	is	no	way	you	can	recover	it.	In house	processing	of	big	data	almost	always	end	up	with	you	throwing	some	data away.	For	all	you	know,	there	may	still	be	useful	signals	in	the	bits	of	data	you have	thrown	away.	This	underscores	the	importance	of	scalable	big	data	systems where	you	can	keep	everything. 	   Cloud	or	in-house? There	are	three	forms	of	big	data	solutions	you	can	choose	from	for	your deployment:	software-only	solution,	hardware	solution,	or	cloud-based	solution. The	deployment	method	that	would	be	the	ideal	route	to	pursue	will	depend	on several	factors	like	the	location	of	your	source	data,	privacy	and	regulatory factors,	availability	of	human	resources	and	specific	requirements	of	the	project. Most	companies	have	opted	for	a	mix	of	on-demand	cloud	resources	together with	their	existing	in-house	big	data	deployments. Big	data	is	big.	And	since	it	is	too	massive	to	manage	through	conventional means	it	follows	that	it	will	also	be	too	big	to	bring	anywhere	or	move	from	one location	to	another.	The	solution	to	this	is	to	move	the	program	--	not	the	data.	It would	be	as	simple	as	running	your	code	on	the	local	web	services	platform which	hosts	the	data	you	need.	It	won’t	cost	you	an	arm	and	a	leg	nor	will	you spend	much	time	to	transfer	the	data	you	need	to	your	system	if	you	do	it	this way.	Remember,	the	fastest	connection	to	any	source	data	is	through	the	data centers	that	host	the	said	data.		Even	a	millisecond	difference	in	processing	time can	spell	the	difference	between	gaining	or	losing	your	competitive	advantage.   Big	Data	as	the	Ultimate	Computing	Platform A	platform	refers	to	the	collection	of	components	or	sub-systems	which	should operate	like	one	object.	A	Formula	One	car	is	the	car	equivalent	of	a supercomputer.	Every	component	of	the	Formula	One	car	and	every	design	have been	fully	optimized	not	only	for	performance,	but	also	performance	for	every kilogram	of	curb	weight	or	every	liter	of	gas.	A	two-liter	engine,	which	yields 320	HP	rather	than	150HP	can	be	achieved	because	this	is	more	efficient. The	racing	car	engine	with	higher	HP	will	have	better	performance.	However, performance	actually	means	efficiency	such	as	miles	per	gallon	or	horsepower per	kilogram.	But	when	it	comes	to	computing	platforms,	this	is	jobs	executed per	watt.	Performance	is	always	measured	as	a	ratio	of	something	achieved	for the	effort	exerted. The	latest	series	of	Honda	F1	technology	are	now	installed	in	other	racing	cars because	optimized	tech	derived	from	the	racing	program	enabled	Honda	to design	cars	with	higher	performance	vehicles	not	only	for	racers	but	also	for general	consumers. For	example,	a	Honda	Civic	has	the	same	platform	with	the	F1.	The	suspension, steering,	brakes,	and	engine	are	all	designed	so	you	will	actually	feel	that	you	are driving	one	vehicle,	and	not	just	a	chunk	of	complicated	subsets.   Big	Data	in	Airplane	Production The	design	as	well	as	the	production	of	a	new	commercial	airplane	is sophisticated,	expensive,	and	mired	in	several	layers	of	regulations.	Hence,	the process	can	be	tedious	and	slow	as	any	lapses	in	the	design	and	structure	could risk	lives. Platforms	which	would	be	produced	out	of	physical	parts	need	more	planning compared	to	platforms	that	are	produced	from	nothing	like	software.	Remember, you	can’t	download	a	new	set	of	engines	every	month. But	the	designers	of	aircraft	today	also	understand	the	value	of	flexible	software. First	developed	in	the	military,	“fly-by-wire”	tech	refers	to	flying	by	using mechanical	wire	and	not	electrical	wire. In	conventional	aircraft,	the	stick	and	pedals	are	mechanically	linked	to	the control	surfaces	on	the	wings;	hence,	the	mechanical	linkages	can	control	these surfaces.	When	it	comes	to	the	fly-by-wire	aircraft,	the	cockpit	controls	are transmitted	to	a	supercomputer,	which	can	control	the	motorized	actuators,	that can	command	the	tail	and	wings. Fighter	planes	also	use	fly-by-wire	software	to	keep	them	safe.	Pilots	can	still turn	so	steep	while	in	flight	that	there	is	the	tendency	for	them	to	pass	out. However,	the	software	can	still	sense	these	factors	and	will	restrict	the	turns	to keep	the	pilots	in	focus	and	alive. These	software	features	are	also	now	applied	to	commercial	aircraft	and	even sedans,	which	make	those	platforms	a	lot	more	efficient	and	safe.	But	if	the	fly- by-wire	software	is	mired	with	design	flaws	and	bugs,	this	could	still	lead	to	a mess	on	the	infield,	which	is	best	to	prevent. 	   Big	Data	Platforms During	the	1960s,	IBM	and	Bank	of	America	create	the	first	credit	card processing	system.	Even	though	these	initial	mainframes	processed	just	a	small percentage	of	the	data	when	compared	to	Amazon	or	eBay	today,	the engineering	was	very	complicated	that	time.	When	credit	cards	became	very popular,	there	was	a	need	to	build	processing	systems	to	manage	the	load	as	well as	handle	the	growth	without	the	need	to	re-engineer	the	system	once	in	a	while. These	prototype	platforms	were	developed	around	software,	peripheral equipment,	and	mainframes	all	from	one	vendor. IBM	also	developed	a	large	database	system	as	a	side-project	for	NASA	for	the Apollo	project	that	later	evolved	as	a	separate	product	as	IMS.	Since	IBM created	these	solutions	to	certain	problems,	which	large	customers	encountered, the	outcome	systems	were	not	yet	products.	These	were	highly	integrated, custom-built,	and	costly	platforms	that	will	later	evolve	into	a	lucrative	business for	IBM. These	solutions	alongside	other	interlinked	software	and	hardware	components were	all	built	as	a	single	system,	normally	by	a	specialized	team	of	experts. Small	groups	collaborated	with	one	another,	hence	the	expert	on	databases, networks,	and	storage	acquired	enough	working	knowledge	in	other	related areas. These	solutions	usually	needed	development	of	new	software	and	hardware technologies,	so	extended	collaboration	of	expertise	was	important	to	the	success of	the	project.	The	proximity	of	the	team	members	allowed	permitted	a	cluster	of knowledge	to	rise,	which	was	important	to	the	success	of	the	platform.	Every	job of	the	team	was	not	complete	until	they	provided	a	completed,	integrated working	platform	to	the	client	as	a	fully	operational	solution	to	the	problem	in the	enterprise. 	 The	End	of	IBM’s	Monopoly During	the	1970s,	the	monopoly	of	IBM	was	curtailed	enough	for	other companies	such	as	Oracle,	DEC,	and	Amdahl	to	rise	and	start	offering	IBM clients	with	alternatives.	DEC	created	small	computers,	which	provided	higher   performance	at	a	fraction	of	the	cost	compared	to	mainframes	produced	by	IBM. But	the	main	issue	was	compatibility.	Meanwhile,	Amdahl	offered	a	compatible alternative,	which	was	less	costly	compared	to	the	IBM	mainframe.	Companies can	now	create	and	market	their	own	range	of	products	and	service	and	become successful	in	the	world	with	less	monopolistic	enterprises. These	options	of	alternative	value	led	to	silos	of	expertise	and	silos	of	vendors inside	the	IT	groups	that	are	already	aligned	with	the	vendors.	Similar	to Amdahl,	Oracle	also	took	advantage	of	the	technology,	which	IBM	created	but never	turned	to	products.	The	cofounder	of	Oracle,	Larry	Elison,	harnessed	the power	of	relational	database	technology,	which	was	originally	developed	by IBM.	Oracle	placed	it	on	seminal	VAX	and	created	one	of	the	first	business software	companies	after	the	mainframe	era. When	products	inside	silos	were	offered	to	customers,	putting	the	system together	was	no	longer	the	concern	of	a	single	supplier.	It	is	now	the	job	of	the customer. Nowadays,	there	are	different	vendors	for	each	possible	silo	-	apps,	language compilers,	databases,	operating	systems,	servers,	storage	arrays,	storage switches,	network	switches	-	and	all	the	sophistication	and	cost,	which	comes with	the	responsibility. Large	systems	integrators	such	as	Wipro	and	Accenture	are	now	trying	to	fill this	gap.	However,	they	also	run	inside	the	constraints	of	IT	departments	and	the same	organizational	silos	created	by	vendors. Silos	are	the	price	paid	for	the	post-mainframe	alternatives	to	IBM.	Silos	could obscure	the	true	nature	of	computer	platforms	as	one	system	of	interlinked software	and	hardware. 	   Big	Data	and	the	Future Oracle	made	a	fortune	because	of	its	post-mainframe	silo	for	many	years	as customers	purchased	their	database	tech	and	ran	it	on	EMC	hardware,	HP,	and Sun.	As	computer	apps	became	more	sophisticated,	creating	platforms	with	silos became	harded,	and	business	organizations	trying	to	use	the	clustering technology	of	Oracle,	RAC,	realized	that	it	sis	quite	impossible	to	establish. Because	this	failure	can	be	a	result	of	their	client’s	own	substandard	platform engineering	that	exposed	more	flaws,	Oracle	developed	an	engineering	platform, which	combined	all	the	parts	and	engineering	product	expertise	that	made lucrative	experiences	possible. Exadata,	the	resulting	product,	was	originally	created	for	the	data	warehouse market.	However,	it	has	found	more	success	with	conventional	Oracle	RAC clients	running	apps	such	as	SAP. Because	Oracle	was	a	software	company,	the	original	release	of	Exadata	was based	on	hardware	created	by	HP.	However,	Exadata	became	successful	that Oracle	had	decided	to	source	the	hardware	parts	that	also	became	part	of	the reason	why	they	have	acquired	Sun.	In	sourcing	all	the	software	and	hardware components	in	Exadata,	Oracle	revived	the	all-in	model	for	mainframe. This	all-in	model	is	also	known	as	“one	throat	to	choke”.	On	the	surface,	this	is enticing,	but	it	will	assume	that	the	throat	could	be	choked.	Large	clients including	AT&T,	Citibank,	and	Amgen	buy	so	much	services	and	equipment, which	they	can	choke	any	vendor	they	want	when	things	go	down. But	for	the	majority	of	users,	because	they	are	too	big	to	manage	their	own database	without	technical	support	from	Oracle	and	too	small	to	demand	timely support	from	Oracle,	all-in	shopping	usually	decreases	the	leverage	of	the customers	with	vendors. Similar	to	Exadata,	big	data	supercomputers	should	be	designed	as	platforms	for engineering,	and	this	design	must	be	built	on	engineering	approach	where	all	the software	and	hardware	parts	are	considered	as	one	system.	This	is	the	system	for platform	–	the	system	it	was	before	these	parts	were	acquired	by	vendor	silos. 	   Fire	Fighters	and	High	Divers At	present,	data	architects	are	responsible	for	designing	the	new	platforms	that are	often	found	in	their	corresponding	IT	departments	where	they	are	working	as experts	in	their	certain	silo.	But	like	building	architects,	platform	architects should	have	an	intensive	working	knowledge	of	the	whole	platform,	which includes	the	enterprise	value	of	the	whole	platform,	the	physical	aspects	of	the plant,	and	bits	of	computer	science. Since	any	part	of	the	platform	could	be	optimized,	repaired	or	triaged,	architects working	on	the	platform	should	be	knowledgeable	of	the	entire	platform	to effectively	collaborate	with	controllers,	business	owners,	UI	designers,	Java	or Linux	programmers,	network	designers,	and	data	center	electricians. Architects	working	on	the	data	platform	should	be	agile	and	capable	enough	to pore	over	the	details	of	the	system	with	the	network	administrator,	and	then	fly to	another	team	composed	of	business	owners.	Overfamiliarity	or	too	much knowledge	in	only	one	aspect	of	the	Big	Data	system	could	obfuscate	the	whole perspective	of	the	platform.	It	is	crucial	to	have	the	capacity	to	filter	out	the details	as	there	are	varied	forms	of	details	and	their	relative	significance	may shift	from	one	form	to	another. Sorting	out	details	according	to	their	importance	is	a	very	crucial	skill	that	a platform	architect	should	have.	Creating	systems	as	platforms	is	a	skill	that	is	not usually	taught	at	school,	and	often	acquired	while	on	the	job. This	aspect	of	Big	Data	rarely	requires	a	learning	process,	which	could	easily alienate	other	group	colleagues,	because	it	may	seem	that	platform	architects	are trying	to	perform	everyone’s	work. But	in	reality,	architects	are	working	on	a	job	that	no	one	knows	or	at	least	no one	is	completely	willing	to	do.	Hence,	many	data	architects	are	not	part	of	the IT	firm,	but	they	are	freelancing	around	the	rough	edges	where	the	platform	is not	recovering	or	scaling. Platform	architects	on	freelance	are	usually	hired	to	triage	the	system.	When	the edges	are	already	polished,	there	is	only	a	slim	chance	of	opportunity	to	inform the	system	owners	about	the	details	of	their	platform. 	   Big	Data	is	Do	It	Yourself	Supercomputing   Big	Data	is	considered	as	Do	It	Yourself	supercomputing.	Regardless	of	the	big data	cluster	they	stand	for,	it	will	come	from	production	without	data	or applications.	To	populate	the	platform,	data	should	be	freed	from	their	own organizational	and	technical	silos. Big	Data	is	now	crucial	for	the	enterprise	because	of	the	business	value	it	holds. Data	specialists	are	developing	new	strategies	in	analyzing	both	the	legacy	data and	the	tons	of	new	data	streaming	in. Both	Operations	and	Development	will	be	responsible	for	the	success	of	the	big data	initiative	of	the	enterprise.	The	walls	between	the	platform,	organization, data,	and	business	can’t	exist	at	worldwide	scale. Like	our	nervous	system,	a	big	data	cluster	is	a	complex	interconnection	system working	from	a	group	of	commodity	parts.	The	neurons	in	the	brain	are considered	as	the	building	blocks	of	the	nervous	system,	but	these	are	very	basic components.	Remember,	the	neurons	in	the	goby	fish	are	also	composed	of	these very	basic	components. But	you	are	far	more	sophisticated	than	the	sum	of	your	goby	fish	parts.	The ultimate	big	data	job	of	your	nervous	system	is	your	personality	and	behavior. 	 Big	Data	Platform	Engineering Big	Data	platforms	should	operate	and	process	data	at	a	scale,	which	leaves minimal	room	for	error.	Similar	to	a	Boeing	747,	clusters	of	big	data	should	be developed	for	efficiency,	scale,	and	speed.	Most	business	organizations venturing	into	big	data	don’t	have	the	expertise	and	the	experience	in	designing and	running	supercomputers.	However,	many	enterprises	are	now	facing	that prospect.	Awareness	of	the	big	data	platform	will	increase	the	chance	of	success with	big	data. Legacy	silos	–	whether	they	are	vendor,	organizational,	or	infrastructure	– should	be	replaced	with	a	perspective	that	is	platform-centric.	Previously, agencies	and	enterprises	were	satisfied	in	buying	an	SQL	prompt	and establishing	their	own	applications. Nowadays,	these	groups	cannot	read	raw	data	science	output,	because	they	need   to	visualize	this	or	else	it	could	be	impossible	to	derive	the	business	value	that they	are	searching	for.	Enterprise	owners	prefer	to	see	images	and	not	raw numbers. Not	similar	to	the	legacy	infrastructure	stack,	silos	have	no	place	in	the	data visualization	stack.	Once	implemented	properly,	big	data	platform	could	deliver the	data	to	the	right	layer,	which	is	the	analytics	layer,	at	the	right	time	for	the right	cost. If	the	platform	could	aggregate	a	more	complex	data	such	as	SQL,	JPGs,	PDFs, videos,	and	tweets,	then	the	analytics	layer	could	be	in	the	best	position	to deliver	intelligence	that	is	actionable	for	the	business. 	   Platform	Engineering	and	Big	Data Platform	engineering	could	be	an	effective,	thrilling	adventure.	To	create	a platform	that	you	have	never	developed	before	as	well	as	to	discover	things	that your	business	never	had	the	opportunity	to	look	for,	you	may	need	to	do	a	lot	of testing.	Testing	should	be	done	quickly	and	frequently	to	ensure	that	the platform	could	still	deliver	at	scale. Numerous	enterprise	IT	divisions	and	their	relative	vendor	silos	can	go	on	to obstruct	awareness	of	the	platform.	Many	individuals	are	struggling	with	big data	because	they	like	to	apply	enterprise-grade	practices	to	worldwide problems. DR	is	a	great	example	of	how	the	silo	mindset	rarely	generates	a	strategy,	which efficiently	and	effectively	restore	a	platform.	Constructing	a	silo-centric	DR	plan pushes	coordination	across	each	single	silo,	and	that	is	also	expensive	and complex. More	often	than	not,	when	the	storage	team	implements	DR	techniques,	they only	do	so	for	storage	and	when	the	group	for	Application	Server	is	running	DR this	is	only	restricted	to	their	app	servers.	Even	though	numerous	companies	get by	through	the	silo	approach	to	enterprise-scale	disaster	recovery,	this	is	rarely optimal.	At	a	worldwide	scale,	it	may	not	work	at	all. Thinking	about	computing	systems	in	an	integrative,	organic,	and	holistic	way could	be	considered	unusual	or	not	even	worth	the	bother,	particularly	when numerous	systems	constructed	within	organizations	may	seem	to	successfully operate	as	silos,	not	only	for	efficiency	or	peak	performance. The	silo	strategy	can	achieve	functional	economies	of	scale	since	this	is	what you	are	measuring.	Gauging	the	efficiency	of	the	platform	could	be	almost difficult	as	constructing	an	efficient	platform. Even	though	the	rules	of	engineering	platform	could	be	applied	to	either business	or	worldwide	scale	computing,	the	difference	is	that	at	business	scale, the	tenets	are	optional.	At	worldwide	scale,	these	are	mandatory.	Engineering platform	for	big	data	requires	three	crucial	mantras:	optimize	everything, perpetual	prototyping,	and	keep	things	simple.   Keep	It	Simple,	Sunshine There	are	benefits	in	keeping	things	simple	at	business	scale,	but	through	big data	technology,	Keeping	It	Simple	Sunshine	 KISS 	are	the	rules	to	follow. Even	with	a	modest	group	with	4800	disks,	400	nodes,	and	20	racks	keeps	a	lot of	moving	parts	and	this	is	a	complicated	organism	and	sophistication	could contribute	to	two	primary	flaws:	operator	glitch	and	software	bugs. Platforms	for	big	data	should	be	planned	to	scale	and	continue	to	work	even	in the	midst	of	failure.	Since	the	law	of	averages	for	failures	could	really	happen, the	software	should	provide	the	capacity	to	scale	and	sustain	a	400-node	cluster constantly	available	even	in	the	face	of	component	errors.	The	software	could support	high	availability	by	offering	service	redundancy	through	different pathways	and	self-rectifying	strategies,	which	reinstates	the	data	loss	because	of glitches. In	conventional	business-scale	software,	HA	abilities	are	not	valued	as	features since	HA	does	nothing	that	is	improved.	This	will	just	keep	things	working. However,	in	supercomputer	groups	with	numerous	interlinked	parts,	HA	is	as crucial	as	scalability. Originally,	HA	features	were	devised	to	resolve	failures,	but	what	will	happen	if the	HA	software	will	fail?	Verification	of	the	robustness	of	the	software	is	a	hard exercise	for	end-case	testing,	which	requires	an	expensive	devotion	for	negative testing.	And	even	if	vendors	are	ruthless,	the	setting	they	use	is	end-case identical	to	the	environment	of	their	customers. Take	note	that	platforms	are	not	generic	unless	they	are	constructed	for replicable	specs.	As	such,	pioneers	of	big	data	tech	have	gone	to	great	length	to reduce	variance	in	platforms	to	prevent	conditions,	which	may	trigger	the	end- case	high	complexity	software	glitches,	which	could	be	very	difficult	to	triage.   Chapter	3:	Big	Data	Analytics 	 Let’s	imagine	that	we	are	still	in	2007,	and	we	are	working	as	part	of	an executive	team	for	an	online	search	company.	Apple	just	introduced	the	iPhone. With	the	new	device,	there	is	a	concern	if	the	company	has	to	develop	a	separate experience	for	those	who	will	use	the	iPhone.	Of	course,	there’s	no	way	to predict	the	future,	and	probably	the	iPhone	is	just	a	fad.	Is	the	iPhone	the	next big	thing? Suppose	you	have	tons	of	data	that	you	can	use.	However,	there	is	no	way	for you	to	query	the	data	and	find	the	answer	to	an	important	figure:	the	number	of users	accessing	the	search	engine	through	the	iPhone. In	2007,	there	is	no	way	to	ask	this	question	without	increasing	the	schema	in your	data	warehouse.	It	is	also	an	expensive	process,	which	may	take	weeks	and even	months.	The	only	way	is	to	wait	and	wish	that	your	competitors	are	not several	steps	ahead	of	you. This	example	shows	the	difference	between	real-time	big	data	analytics	and conventional	analytics.	In	the	past,	it	is	crucial	to	know	the	types	of	questions you	want	to	ask	before	you	can	store	the	data. Today,	technologies	such	as	Hadoop	provide	you	the	flexibility	and	the	scale	to store	data,	before	you	know	how	you	can	process	it.	Certain	technologies	such	as Impala,	Hive,	and	MapReduce	will	allow	you	to	process	queries	without transforming	the	supporting	data	structures. At	present,	you	are	much	less	likely	to	encounter	a	scenario	in	which	you	can’t query	data	and	receive	a	response	in	a	short	span	of	time.	Analytical	processes which	used	to	require	months	to	complete	have	been	reduced	to	mere	hours. However,	shorter	processing	times	have	resulted	to	higher	expectations.	Just	a few	years	ago,	most	data	scientists	believe	that	if	it	takes	you	less	than	40 minutes	to	get	results	from	a	query,	that	is	no	miracle.	Now,	there	are expectations	for	the	speed	of	thought	as	in	you	are	thinking	of	a	query,	the engine	will	instantly	provide	a	result,	and	then	you	start	the	experiment. These	days,	the	target	is	all	now	about	computing	with	faster	speed	processing   questions	that	are	unknown,	defining	new	ideas,	and	decreasing	the	time between	when	the	event	is	happening	in	a	certain	point	of	the	globe,	and someone	being	able	to	react	or	respond	to	the	event	practically	instantly. A	fast	rising	world	of	newer	technologies	has	significantly	lowered	the	cycle time	of	data	processing,	which	makes	it	easy	to	experiment	and	explore	with data	in	new	ways,	which	are	not	heard	of	just	two	to	three	years	ago. In	spite	of	the	availability	of	new	systems	and	tools	for	managing	Big	Data	at ultra-speeds,	however,	the	real	promise	of	advanced	data	analytics	also encompass	the	realm	of	pure	technology. Real-time	Big	Data	is	not	only	a	process	for	storing	petabytes	of	data	in	a	data reservoir.	This	is	also	about	the	capacity	to	make	informed	decisions	and	take the	right	actions	at	the	best	time.	This	is	about	triggering	a	sales	promo	while	a shopper	visits	a	website,	detecting	fraudulent	transactions	while	someone	is using	a	credit	card,	or	posting	an	advertisement	on	a	website	while	someone	is accessing	a	certain	article.	This	is	about	merging	and	studying	data,	so	you	can do	the	right	move,	at	the	right	place,	and	at	the	right	time. For	enterprises,	real-time	big	data	analytics	is	the	key	in	improving	sales, cheaper	marketing	costs,	and	increased	profits.	For	innovators	in	IT,	this	is	the beginning	of	an	era	signified	by	machines	who	can	think	and	respond	like	real humans.   Big	Data	and	Ultra	Speed The	ability	to	store	data	at	a	fast	rate	is	not	entirely	new.	The	area	that	is	new	is the	ability	to	make	something	useful	with	this	data	with	cost-efficiency	in	mind. For	decades,	governments	and	multi-national	companies	have	been	storing	and processing	tons	of	data.	Today,	we	are	seeing	first-hand	the	stream	of	new techniques	to	make	sense	of	these	data	sets.	Aside	from	the	new	capacities	in handling	huge	amounts	of	data,	we	are	also	witnessing	the	rise	of	new technologies	that	are	created	to	manage	complex,	non-conventional	data	- specifically	the	types	of	semi-structured	or	unstructured	data	produced	by	web logs,	sensors,	census	reports,	warranties,	customer	service	records,	mobile networks,	and	social	media.	Previously,	data	should	be	neatly	organized	in	sets or	tables.	But	in	modern	data	analytics,	anything	could	happen.	Heterogeneity	is considered	the	new	norm,	and	present-day	data	scientists	are	familiar	to	knowing their	way	through	lumps	of	data	culled	from	different	sources. Software	structures	such	as	MapReduce	and	Hadoop	that	support	distributed processing	apps	on	relatively	cheap	commodity	hardware,	makes	it	easy	to integrate	data	from	different	resources.	The	data	sets	today	are	not	merely	bigger than	the	previous	data	sets,	because	they	are	considerably	more	sophisticated. The	three	dimensions	of	Big	Data	are	velocity,	variety,	and	volume.	And	inside every	dimension	is	a	wide	array	of	variables. The	capacity	to	handle	large	and	complicated	sets	of	data	has	not	reduced	the demand	for	more	size	and	faster	speed.	Each	day,	it	seems	that	a	new	technology app	is	launched,	which	drives	the	Big	Data	technology	further. For	instance,	Druid	is	a	system	used	in	scanning	billions	of	records	for	every second.	It	can	process	33	million	rows	per	second	per	core	and	could	absorb speeds	of	10,000	records	per	second	per	node.	This	could	query	six	terabytes	of in-memory	data	for	only	a	fraction	of	a	second.	Data	scientists	describe	Druid	as a	system	that	moves	huge	data	sets	at	fast	speed. 	   The	Big	Data	Reality	of	Real	Time The	definition	of	“real	time”	may	vary	depending	on	the	context	that	it	is	used. In	the	similar	sense	that	there	is	really	no	genuine	unstructured	data,	the	concept of	real	time	is	also	not	true.	Basically,	if	we	are	talking	about	real-time	or	near real-time	systems,	we	are	referring	to	the	architectures,	which	allow	you	to	react to	data	as	you	access	it	without	the	need	to	store	the	data	in	a	database	first. To	put	it	simply,	real-time	signifies	the	capacity	to	process	data	as	you	receive	it, instead	of	storing	the	data	and	retrieving	it	at	a	later	date.	This	is	the	main importance	of	the	term.	Real	time	refers	to	the	fact	that	you	are	processing	data in	the	present,	instead	of	the	future. Meanwhile,	the	present	also	has	various	meanings	to	various	users.	From	the point	view	of	an	online	merchant,	the	present	refers	to	the	attention	span	of	a possible	customer.	If	the	processing	time	of	the	transaction	goes	beyond	the attention	span	of	a	customer,	the	merchant	will	not	regard	it	as	real	time. But	from	the	perspective	of	the	options	trader,	real	time	signifies	milliseconds. But	from	the	perspective	of	a	guided	missile,	real	time	signifies	micro-seconds. For	many	data	scientists,	real	time	refers	to	quite	fast	at	the	data	layer	and	very fast	at	the	decision	layer.	Real	time	is	considered	only	for	robots.	If	the	system includes	humans,	it	is	not	considered	as	real	time	as	we	require	one	to	two seconds	before	we	can	respond,	and	this	is	very	long	for	a	conventional transactional	system	in	managing	input	and	output. However,	this	doesn’t	mean	that	Big	Data	developers	have	already	foregone	the efforts	to	create	faster	platforms.	Continuing	projects	such	as	the	Spark	by	Matei Zaharia	are	still	up	for	the	challenge.	Spark	is	an	open	source	cluster	computing, which	could	be	easily	programmed	and	could	run	really	fast.	Spark	depends	on RDDs	or	resilient	distributed	datasets,	which	could	be	used	to	query	one	to	two TB	of	data	in	a	fraction	of	a	second. In	a	setting	that	involves	engine	learning	algorithms	as	well	as	other	multi-pass algorithms,	Spark	could	run	10	to	100	times	faster	compared	to	the	MapReduce of	Hadoop.	Spark	is	also	the	supporting	engine	of	the	data	warehousing	system, Shark. IT	firms	such	as	Quantifind	and	Conviva	have	created	UIs,	which	launch	Spark   on	the	back	end	of	the	dashboard	analytics.	Hence,	if	you	are	viewing	some	stats on	the	dashboard	and	you	want	to	make	sense	of	certain	data	sets	that	are	not	yet calculated,	you	can	still	query	a	question,	which	will	come	out	to	a	parallel calculation	on	Spark	and	you	can	see	results	in	about	0.50	seconds. Another	breakthrough	platform	in	Big	Data	world	is	Storm,	which	is	an	open- source	low-latency	processing	system	developed	to	integrate	with	current bandwidth	and	queueing	system.	This	is	now	used	by	companies	such	as	Ooyala, Groupon,	the	Weather	Channel,	and	even	Twitter.	Storm	is	authored	by	Nathan Marz	who	also	developed	other	open-source	projects	such	as	Elephant	DB	and Cascalog. According	to	Marz,	stream	and	batch	are	the	only	two	paradigms	in	processing data.	Basically,	batch	processing	is	of	high-latency.	Hence,	if	you	are	trying	to assess	1	Tb	of	data	at	the	same	time,	it	could	be	a	challenge	to	perform	the calculation	in	split	seconds	compared	to	a	batch	processing. In	stream	processing,	on	the	other	hand,	smaller	amounts	of	data	are	noted	as they	come.	With	this,	you	can	perform	complicated	calculations	such	as	parallel search	as	well	as	integrate	queries	really	fast.	Traditionally,	if	you	like	to perform	a	search	query,	you	first	need	to	build	search	indexes	that	could	take time	in	one	machine.	But	through	Storm,	it	is	possible	to	stream	the	process across	different	machines,	and	obtain	results	at	a	faster	rate. For	instance,	Twitter	is	using	Storm	to	determine	trends	in	‘real	time’.	In	an ideal	setting,	Storm	will	enable	Twitter	to	understand	the	intent	of	users	in practically	real	time.	For	instance,	if	a	user	tweets	that	she	is	going	to	the	beach, storm	will	trigger	the	ads	that	are	most	suitable	for	that	person	at	that	moment. Even	though	it	is	software	supported	by	Big	Data	platform,	Storm	is	surprisingly easy	to	use.	This	tech	can	solve	really	complicated	problems	such	as	managing partial	errors	in	process	distribution	and	fault	tolerance.	Storm	offers	a	platform that	any	enterprise	can	build	on.	There	is	no	need	to	concentrate	on	the infrastructure;	after	all,	this	has	already	been	accomplished	by	this	platform. Anyone	with	basic	knowledge	of	IT	can	set	up	Storm	and	use	it	within	minutes.   The	Real	Time	Big	Data	Analytics	Stack	 RTBDA  At	this	point,	it	is	now	clear	that	the	architecture	for	managing	RTBDA	is gradually	rising	from	a	separate	set	of	tools	and	programs.	But	what	is	not	clear is	the	form	of	the	architecture.	In	this	book,	we	will	sketch	out	a	practical roadmap	for	RTBDA,	which	will	serve	different	stakeholders	not	only	vendors and	users	but	also	executives	such	as	COOs,	CFOs,	CIOs,	who	have	major	say when	it	comes	to	purchasing	decisions	for	IT. Concentrating	on	the	stakeholders	as	well	as	their	needs	is	crucial	because	it	is	a reminder	that	the	RTBDA	is	still	existing	for	a	particular	purpose	and	that	is	to create	business	value	from	mere	data.	You	must	also	bear	in	mind	that	‘real time’	and	‘value’	have	various	meanings	to	various	subsets	of	stakeholders.	At present,	there	is	no	generic	platform	that	makes	sense	if	you	consider	that	the interrelationship	among	technology,	process,	and	people	within	the	Big	Data world	is	still	in	its	evolutionary	stage. The	popular	IT	blogger,	David	Smith,	proposed	a	design	for	data	analytics.	Even though	the	stack	is	designed	for	predictive	analysis,	this	will	serve	as	a	good paradigm. The	Data	Layer	is	the	foundation	of	the	stack.	In	this	level,	you	have	Hadoop MapReduce’s	unstructured	data,	structured	data	in	Impala,	Hbase,	NoSQL,	and RDBMS;	streaming	data	for	operational	systems,	sensors,	social	media	and	other data	from	the	web.	IT	tools	such	as	Spark,	Storm,	HBase,	and	Hive	are	also included	in	this	layer. Above	the	data	layer	is	the	analytics	layer,	which	provides	a	production	setting for	deploying	dynamic	analytics	as	well	as	real-time	scoring.	It	also	has	a	local data	mart,	which	is	regularly	updated	from	the	data	and	there	is	also	the development	setting	for	creating	paradigms.	This	is	located	near	the	analytics engine	in	order	to	improve	performance. The	integration	layer	is	situated	above	the	analytics	layer.	This	is	considered	as the	glue,	which	holds	the	end-user	apps	and	the	engines	together.	This	often includes	a	CEP	engine	and	rules	engine	as	well	as	the	API	for	dynamic	analytics, which	will	broker	the	connection	between	the	data	scientists	and	the	app developers. On	the	top	is	the	decision	layer,	which	includes	end-user	apps	such	as	enterprise   intelligence	software,	interactive	web	apps,	mobile,	and	desktop.	This	is	the layer	at	which	customers,	c-suite	executives,	and	business	analysts	access	big data	analytics. Again,	it	is	crucial	to	take	note	that	every	layer	is	relative	to	the	different	sets	of consumers,	and	that	various	sets	of	consumers	have	their	own	definition	of	real time.	Furthermore,	the	four	layers	of	analytics	are	not	passive	clusters	of	tech. Every	layer	will	enable	an	important	phase	of	deploying	real-time	analytics.   What	Can	Big	Data	Do	For	You? Big	data	analytics	is	all	about	examining	massive	volumes	of	structured	and unstructured	data	sets	to	search	for	hidden	marketing	patterns,	discover previously	unknown	correlations,	uncover	new	market	trends,	and	reveal	actual customer	preferences	and	other	business	information	that	can	help	you	make more	informed	business	decisions.	The	valuable	information	you	will	be	able	to unearth	will	help	you	sharpen	your	marketing	thrust	and	target	markets	with pinpoint	accuracy.	You	will	be	able	to	discover	new	ways	to	earn	revenue, improve	customer	experience,	enhance	operational	efficiency,	and	ultimately gain	an	advantage	over	competitors. There	are	actually	three	distinct types	of	analytics	namely descriptive	analytics,	predictive analytics,	and	prescriptive analytics.	Not	one	of	them	is better	than	the	better.	In	fact,	they are	often	used	in	tandem	with	one another	since	their	individual results	complement	each	other. For	a	company	to	compete efficiently	in	any	market,	it	must have	a	comprehensive	view	of that	market	–	something	that	can	only	be	had	if	you	have	a	powerful	analytic environment.	And	you	can	only	have	a	robust	analytic	setup	if	you	use	any combination	of	these	three	types	of	analytic	models	that	suits	your	purpose. Descriptive	Analytics This	is	an	analytics	process	that	describes	the	past	and	events	that	have	already occurred	whether	it	is	one	second	ago	or	a	year	ago.	It	summarizes	and	describes past	data	with	the	objective	of	picking	up	some	lessons	from	past	behavior	and determine	how	they	may	influence	future	endeavors.	Basically,	it	provides answers	to	the	question	of	“What	happened?”	Common	examples	of	descriptive analytics	include	financial	reports,	the	company’s	historical	production	and operational	data,	sales	and	inventory	report,	and	customers’	logs.   Predictive	Analytics This	is	an	analytics	process	which	is	based	on	probabilities.	It	makes	use	of statistical	models	and	forecasting	techniques	basically	to	find	answers	to	the question	of	“What	could	possibly	happen?”	In	other	words,	as	its	name	suggests, predictive	analytics	has	the	ability	to	“Predict”	with	a	great	degree	of	accuracy what	could	possibly	happen	based	on	data	at	hand.	It	provides	companies	with actionable	insights	by	chances	of	future	outcomes	happening	through	the	use	of statistical	algorithm.	The	resulting	statistical	study	is	then	used	by	companies	to prepare	for	what	could	possibly	happen	in	the	future.	However,	you	have	to remember	that	there	are	no	statistical	algorithm	that	can	predict	future	outcomes with	100%	accuracy	which	means	you	have	to	allow	some	room	for	any discrepancy. Prescriptive	Analytics This	analytics	process	goes	beyond	the	previous	two	 descriptive	and	predictive analytics 	because	it	prescribes	not	one	but	several	different	actionable	insights or	advice	you	can	follow	all	of	which	are	meant	to	guide	you	to	reach	a	solution to	the	problem	at	hand.	With	the	use	of	optimization	and	simulation	algorithms, prescriptive	analytics	attempts	to	quantify	the	effect	of	future	decisions	allowing you	to	see	what	could	possibly	result	from	your	decisions.	Basically,	what	it attempts	to	do	is	to	come	up	with	several	tips	on	how	to	answer	the	question “What	should	we	do?”	In	short,	prescriptive	analytics	is	about	what	will	happen. But	much	more	than	predicting	future	outcome,	it	will	also	tell	you	why	it	will happen	and	recommend	some	course	of	action	to	take	to	take	advantage	of	the predicted	future	outcome. Prescriptive	analytics	is	quite	complex	to	execute	and	roll	into	action.	This	is because	it	makes	use	of	a	mixture	of	several	different	techniques	and	tools	like algorithms,	computer	modeling	techniques,	and	machine	learning	concepts	along with	certain	business	rules.	This	mix	of	tools	and	techniques	is	applied	against both	structured	and	non-structured	data	sets,	e.g.	from	transactional	data	to	real time	data	feeds.	And,	once	set	in	place	and	properly	executed,	prescriptive analytics	will	have	a	profound	impact	on	the	way	companies	make	their	business decisions	as	well	as	help	improve	their	bottom	line.	There	are	many	companies who	are	able	to	utilize	prescriptive	analytics	today	to	boost	production, optimizing	the	supply	chain	so	that	they	are	able	to	deliver	the	right	products	at the	right	time	as	well	as	enhance	customer	experience.   Top	High	Impact	Use	Cases	of	Big	Data	Analytics If	you	are	still	in	the	dark	on	how you	can	use	big	data	analytics	in combination	with	each	other	to	meet your	business	goals,	here	are	some broad	ideas	to	help	you	get	started. Based	on	a	study	made	by Datameer.com,	the	top	high	impact uses	of	big	data	analytics	are	as	follows:  1.	 Customer	Analytics	-	48% 2.	 Operational	Analytics	–  21%  3.	 Risk	and	Compliance	Analytics	–	12% 4.	 New	Product	and	Services	Innovation	–	10%  Customer	analytics This	makes	use	of	big	data	analytics	techniques	such	as	predictive	modeling, information	management,	data	visualization,	and	segmentation	to	generate	the right	customer	insight	which	a	company	needs	to	be	able	to	deliver	timely, relevant,	and	anticipated	offers	to	their	customers.	At	48%,	Customer	analytics makes	up	the	bulk	of	big	data	high	impact	uses	according	to	a	survey	conducted by	Datameer.com. Needless	to	say,	customer	analytics	is	the	backbone	of	all	marketing	endeavors	and	digital	marketing	is	fast becoming	the	norm.	Considering	the	fact	that	most	if	not	all	customers	are	always	connected	to	the	web	and therefore	have	access	to	information	anywhere	and	anytime;	and	since	it	is	the	customers	who	decide	what to	buy,	where	to	buy,	and	how	much	to	spend,	it	becomes	increasingly	necessary	for	companies	to anticipate	customer	behavior	so	they	can	make	the	most	appropriate	and	timely	response	to	any	customer concern	as	well	as	provide	much	needed	offers	that	will	attract	and	not	push	away	the	customers.	With customer	analytics,	companies	are	able	to	better	understand	customers'	buying	habits	and	lifestyle   preferences	and	predict	future	buying	behaviors. 	 Operational	analytics This	takes	the	other	21%	of	the	surveyed	big	data	high	impact	uses.	This	type	of business	analytics	is	designed	to	improve	and	make	more	efficient	a	company’s existing	operations.	It	makes	use	of	various	data	mining	and	data	collection	tools to	aggregate	relevant	information	which	businesses	can	use	to	plan	for	a	more effective	business	operation.	It	is	sometimes	called	the	“analytics	on	the	fly”	by experts	because	most	of	the	analytics	tools	and	software	used	to	observe	and analyze	business	processes	do	it	in	real	time. What	operational	analytics	does	is	to	continuously	monitor	how	specific business	operations	work	and	present	its	observation	in	a	visual	way	through graphs	or	charts	in	real	time	or	over	a	specified	period	of	time	thus	allowing	the company’s	decision	makers’	to	have	a	clear	perspective	of	what	is	actually	going on	anytime	so	that	they	can	make	timely	changes	to	their	operations	as	needed when	needed. In	essence,	the	function	of	operational	analytics	is	to	help	companies	conduct quicker	but	more	targeted	analyses	of	business	operations	and	use	the information	gathered	as	basis	for	resource	planning,	streamlining	business processes,	and	charting	the	future	course	of	the	company.   Risk	and	Compliance	Analytics Risk	and	Compliance Analytics	is	the	heart	of every	Enterprise	Risk Management	 ERM 	activity and	makes	up	for	12%	of total	Big	Data	high	impact	uses.	It	involves	the	use	of	the	same	type	of	big	data analytics	and	key	technologies	used	to	collect,	process,	and	analyze	real	time data.	Only	this	time,	the	analytics	have	been	fine-tuned	into	“continuous monitoring”	and	“continuous	auditing”	technologies	and	tweaked	to	detect	fraud and	other	risks	that	may	be	lurking	within	the	realm	of	both	structured	and unstructured	data.	Risk	and	compliance	analytics	monitor	data	in	transit	looking for	preset	keywords	that	will	identify	and	isolate	responsive	or	hot	documents. The	electronic	discovery	will	then	trigger	an	alert	calling	for	further	human surveillance	and	possible	action. The	level	of	legal	and	compliance	risks	that	confronts	every	enterprise	is increasing	along	with	the	rise	in	the	volume,	velocity	and	variety	of	big	data.	It is	therefore	necessary	for	every	enterprise	to	increasing	adopt	risk	and compliance	analytics	tools	and	techniques	to	minimize	the	effects	of	such	risks not	only	on	the	enterprise's	capital	and	earnings	but	also	financial,	strategic, operational,	and	other	risks. New	Products	and	Services	Innovation New	products	and	services innovation	analytics	aims	to translate	the	massive	volume of	data	streaming	in	real	time into	information	they	can	use to	pinpoint	where	innovation is	needed,	to	identify	which	features	are	more	appealing	to	customers,	determine how	customers	actually	use	the	product,	identify	components	that	fail	more often,	and	most	important	of	all	to	bring	down	the	cost	of	ownership.	In	short	the objective	of	this	analytics	process	is	to	develop	products	that	will	not	only perform	better	but	is	totally	aligned	to	what	the	customers	actually	need.   There	are	innovative	product	development	teams	in	practically	every	industry and	they	account	for	10%	of	high	impact	big	data	uses.		They	collect,	segregate, and	process	real	time	information	and	transform	them	into	actionable information	to	produce	better	and	more	affordable	products. Here	is	some	good	news	for	you.	Whatever	your	big	data	needs	may	be,	there are	specific	big	data	analytics	tools	and	techniques	that	offer	solutions.	All	you need	to	do	is	to	deploy	them.	However,	if	you	still	find	them	to	be	insufficient you	can	have	big	data	algorithms	written	for	you	and	tailored	to	your	specific requirement	by	companies	who	offer	such	services	–	and	there	are	hundreds	of them	out	there.   Chapter	4.	Why	Big	Data	Matters Many	companies	go	into big	data	simply	because every	big	name	in	their industry	is	in	to	it. Unfortunately,	they	take	a big	data	plunge	without realizing	why	it	matters	to	them.	In	the	end	they	end	up	drowning	in	the	sea	of information	that	starts	to	clog	up	the	data	management	system	they	deploy	to handle	big	data.	One	has	to	understand	why	big	data	matters	and	how	it	can make	a	difference	to	his	company’s	operations	before	one	can	draw	value	from it.   So,	does	Big	Data	really	matter? For	big	enterprises	like	Amazon,	Google,	and	Facebook,	there	is	no	question about	it.	They	have	been	using	it	all	along,	albeit	successfully.	To	them,	big	data analytics	has	become	not	only	part	and	parcel	of	their	marketing	and	operational mix	but	now	serves	as	one	of	the	pillars	of	their	foundation.	They	cannot	do much	without	the	much	needed	inputs	they	are	able	to	gather	from	big	data analytics.	They	rely	heavily	on	it	to	come	up	with	creative	and	innovative	ideas to	serve	their	customers	better.	In	fact,	their	pioneering	efforts	in	the	use	of	big data	became	the	impetus	for	the	rapid	development	of	more	high	impact	uses	of big	data	analytics	today. For	the	small	and	medium	size	enterprises,	however,	the	question	remains	to	be a	bit	difficult	to	answer.	SMEs	have	for	so	long	relied	on	traditional	methods	of developing	their	markets	and	achieving	their	corporate	objectives	that	they	feel	a changeover	will	be	more	disrupting	to	their	operations.	That	is	mainly	the	reason why	they	shy	away	from	the	idea	of	incorporating	big	data	solutions	to	their marketing	mix.	Unfortunately,	they	are	missing	the	most	basic	point	–	wisdom emanates	from	data	and	serves	as	its	foundation.	By	querying	data	you	will	be able	to	extract	vital	information.	This	information	is	then	interpreted	and becomes	stock	knowledge.	Once	knowledge	is	evaluated	against	experience,	it becomes	revered	as	wisdom. This	is	exactly	what	happened	to	Amazon	when	it	started	capturing	and collecting	massive	customer	data	and	stored	all	the	searches	and	all	the transactions	made	by	their	customers	along	with	every	single	piece	of information	available.	They	then	segregated	the	information	that	is	of	value	to them	from	those	they	categorized	as	extraneous.	From	this,	they	were	able	to extract	a	valued,	fine-tuned	marketing	data	element	which	became	the	backbone of	their	innovative	approach	to	recommending	and	offering	products	which	their customers	actually	need.	With	the	use	of	big	data	analytics,	Amazon continuously	store	information	on	what	products	people	buy,	where	they	buy them,	and	all	the	data	on	their	actual	past	purchases.	They	combine	these information	with	other	public	data	to	bring	a	deeper	understanding	on	how, what,	and	why	people	buy	specific	products.	With	analytics,	Amazon	is	able	to interpret	market	trends	to	create	an	online	customer	servicing	scheme	that	is uniquely	identified	as	Amazon’s.   Facebook	does pretty	much	the same	thing	as Amazon.	They both	mine	usable data	which	they then	used	to	create more	focused	recommendations.		Using	information	mined	from	varied	big	data source,	Facebook	is	able	to	create	unique	group	offerings	that	are	fine	tuned	to the	needs	and	wants	of	its	members.	It	is	able	to	produce	highly	targeted	ads with	product	offerings	that	reach	a	specifically-defined	audience.	Facebook’s unique	friend	suggestions	features	that	was	copied	by	every	social	media network	is	also	a	creation	culled	from	big	data	analytics. Google	on	the	other	hand,	is	one	of	the	original	creators	of	Big	Data	tools	and techniques	that	served	as	the	model	for	most	analytics	software	and	solutions that	are	in	use	today.	In	fact,	most	of	the	software	elements	that	make	up	Big Data	came	from	Google	or	was	initially	created	by	it.	Like	Amazon	and Facebook,	Google	leverages	big	data	but	it	employs	a	different	approach	with	a different	focus.	Google’s	objective	is	to	exploit	Big	Data	to	the	hilt;	use	it	to evaluate	and	weigh	search	results,	forecast	Internet	traffic	usage,	and	create Google	applications	aimed	at	providing	more	efficient	services	to	its	clients.	For example,	by	mining	the	massive	Google	search	information,	and	their	stored data	on	user	preferences,	histories,	etc.,	it	can	link	actual	web	searches	to specific	products	or	services	that	fit	the	search	criteria	to	the	tee. You	may	argue	that	Facebook,	Amazon,	and	Google	are	huge	entities	and therefore	they	not	only	have	access	to	and	have	the	capacity	to	store	petabytes	of data,	they	can	also	produce	massive	volumes	of	data	by	themselves.	But,	what about	the	small	and	medium	size	enterprises	whose	logistics,	financial	resources, and	technical	knowhow	are	rather	limited?	Their	individual	operations	do	not deal	with	huge	amounts	of	unstructured	data	much	less	produce	petabytes	of	the same	like	their	giant	online	counterparts	Facebook,	Amazon,	and	Google.	Can they	still	benefit	from	and	take	advantage	of	Big	Data	analytics	in	the	like manner? Big	Data	analytics	can	make	a	big	difference	to	various	operational	segments	not   only	of	the	giant	companies	but	also	those	of	the	small	and	medium	enterprises  SMEs 	too.	There	is	no	doubt	about	that.	It	can	create	new	values	that	will enhance	the	way	SMEs	conduct	business	and	improve	their	profitability	at	the same	time.	The	good	news	is	there	are	recent	developments	in	the	realm	of	big data	technology	which	make	it	possible	for	SMEs	to	tap	into	the	vast	potential	of big	data	analytics	without	allocating	valuable	resources	beyond	what	their budget	and	manpower	can	afford.	For	example,	aside	from	having	access	to	tons of	free	information	that	are	readily	available	from	the	World	Wide	Web	through various	social	networking	sites	and	other	blog	sites.	Also,	there	exist	several affordable	hosted	services	today	that	offers	tremendous	computing	power, almost	unlimited	data	storage,	and	a	whole	caboodle	of	big	data	analytics platforms	they	can	use	for	different	projects.	The	good	part	is	they	can	limit	their subscription	only	to	the	services	they	need	paying	just	a	small	subscription	fee. In	other	words,	they	only	need	to	pay	for	‘what	they	consume’	–	no	more	no less.		With	these	developments,	SMEs	can	now	experiment	on	putting	together the	best	big	data	set	up	that	is	most	suitable	for	their	specific	needs	without incurring	huge	expenses.   There	are,	however,	other	obstacles	that	remain Since	the	recent	developments	have	practically	eliminated	the	need	for	SMEs	to set	up	t	costly	big	data	storage	systems	and	brought	down	the	costs	of	acquiring big	data	platforms	and	solutions	down	to	a	level	manageable	even	by	those	with limited	resources,	SMEs	appear	to	be	ready	to	leverage	Big	Data.	But	hold	your horses	first	because	there	are	other	obstacles	that	need	to	be	tackled	and challenges	that	need	to	be	hurdled	before	you	can	get	a	big	data	system	running smoothly	according	to	your	wishes.		First	of	all,	you	don’t’	just	analyze	any	data that	is	there	simply	because	they	are	there.	You	have	to	consider	the	purity	of	the data	and	filter	out	the	garbage	from	the	relevant.	And,	when	you	analyze	the relevant	data	it	must	be	for	a	specific	business	objective	which	means	you	have to	have	a	clear	understanding	of	analytics	and	a	at	least	a	working	knowledge	of statistics.	In	other	words	leveraging	big	data	must	be	done	in	an	intelligent fashion	whether	it	is	implemented	in-house	or	through	hosting	services. With	the	amount	of	data	exploding	exponentially,	the	key	basis	of	competition has	now	shifted	to	the	capacity	of	businesses	to	analyze	large	volumes	of structured	and	unstructured	data	sets.	This	leaves	today’s	business	leaders	with no	choice	but	to	contend	with	big	data	analytics	 directly	or	indirectly 	since	it	is now	the	main	factor	that	underpins	productivity	growth,	profitability,	and innovation.	It	will	be	suicidal	to	ignore	the	ever	increasing	volume	of	highly detailed	information	generated	by	businesses	and	government	agencies.	It	would be	negligent	to	shrug	off	the	rise	of	multimedia,	social	media,	instant	messaging, e-mail,	and	other	Internet-enabled	technologies.	It	would	be	negligent	to	ignore the	fact	that	we	now	live	in	an	increasingly	sensor-enabled	and	instrumented world.	They	are	the	true	driving	force	behind	the	exponential	growth	in	data. This	opens	up	the	possibility	that	Big	Data	may	grow	too	big	too	soon	such	that we	may	find	it	difficult	to	create	new	value	from	it.	This	may	put	us	in	a situation	where	we	may	have	to	choose	the	quality	of	the	data	over	the	quantity. Nevertheless,	we	need	to	prepare	for	any	contingencies	and	be	ready	to	manage head	on	a	continually	increasing	volume	of	data	sets	any	time.   Chapter	5.	A	Closer	Look	at	Key	Big	Data	Challenges It	may	surprise	you	to	know	that	despite	all	the	buzz	surrounding	big	data	and	in spite	of	the	fact	that	a	sweeping	cultural	change	geared	towards	transforming enterprises	into	information-centric,	data	driven	organizations,	many	of	our business	and	IT	leaders	still	find	themselves	groping	in	the	dark	and	struggling to	understand	the	concept	of	big	data.	There	is	no	way	they	can	develop	and implement	a	workable	big	data	strategy	this	way.	They	have	to	understand	the concept	and	hurdle	the	key	big	data	challenges	before	they	can	bring	their organization	to	level	up	and	put	a	big	data	system	in	place	and	working	perfectly for	them. Below	are	the	key	big	data	challenges	that	must	be	tackled	first	before	they	can bring	their	organization	to	the	next	level.   Difficulty	in	Understanding	and	Utilizing	Big	Data According	to	a survey	conducted in	2013	among business	leaders	in Australia	and surrounding countries	by	a company	called Big	Insights,	it appears	that understanding	and	utilizing	big	data	for	their	respective	companies	seems	to	be their	biggest	big	data	challenge.	Apparently,	many	of	the	business	and	IT	leaders who	participated	in	the	survey	are	still	unclear	about	the	concept	of	big	data	and are	still	struggling	to	understand	the	many	benefits	it	had	to	offer	their	respective businesses.	A	similar	survey	conducted	recently	by	Jaspersoft	revealed	the	same disturbing	news	–	that	there	is	much	confusion	among	many	business	and	IT leaders	on	how	to	go	about	implementing	a	big	data	strategy.	According	to	this survey,	27%	of	the	respondents	still	have	difficulty	understanding	the	concept while	another	20%	do	not	see	how	big	data	will	benefit	their	organizations. Even	some	of	the	top	honchos	of	companies	which	sank	substantial	funds	into their	big	data	projects	are	finding	difficulty	in	understanding	which	available data	sets	to	use	and	how	to	create	new	value	from	the	data	sets	to	further	the company’s	objectives,	strategy,	and	tactics.	They	are	also	intimidated	by	the	fact that	with	the	ever	exploding	volume	of	big	data,	analytics	will	have	to	be	an ongoing	activity	which	needs	their	constant	attention	and	participation.   New,	Complex,	and	Continuously	Evolving	Technologies Most	of	the	big	data	tools	and	technology	are	groundbreaking.	They	are	also becoming	increasingly	complex	not	to	mention	the	fact	that	they	are	evolving	at an	ever-accelerating	rate.	You	cannot	expect	all	business	and	IT	leaders	to	be familiar	with	much	less	understand	these	innovative	big	data	solutions immediately.	They	will	have	to	learn	the	latest	technologies	to	keep	abreast	of the	latest	developments	before	they	can	utilize	big	data	analytics	more effectively	to	their	company’s	advantage.	And,	learning	must	be	on	a	continuing basis. They	may	even	have	to	deal	with	different	big	data	solutions	providers	and partners	in	bigger	numbers	than	those	they	have	dealt	with	in	the	past.		At	the same	time,	they	have	to	balance	the	costs	of	subscribing	to	big	data	solutions provider	with	their	actual	business	needs	by	limiting	their	service	subscriptions only	to	what	they	need	at	the	moment	relative	to	the	project	at	hand.   Data	Security	Related	to	Cloud	Based	Big	Data	Solutions Cloud	based	big	data	solutions	offer	SMBs	huge	tremendous	cost	saving opportunities	and	utmost	flexibility	compared	to	setting	up	an	in	house	data storage	facility.	With	cloud	based	big	data	solutions	company	data	can	be	stored and	managed	in	various	data	centers	remotely	located	all	around	the	globe. Unfortunately,	it	raises	concerns	related	to	data	security.	The	common	issue	is still	the	safe	keeping	and	management	of	confidential	company	data.	   Chapter	6.	Generating	Business	Value	through	Data Mining 	 Data	mining	is	an	aspect	of	the	Big	Data	tech	with	tons	of	potential	to	help	your business	concentrate	on	the	most	relevant	information	in	the	data	you	have collected	about	the	behavior	and	personalities	of	your	customers	as	well	as	your target	market.	Through	data	mining,	you	can	discover	information	within	the data,	which	queries	and	reports	may	not	easily	reveal.	In	this	chapter,	we	will explore	the	different	components	of	data	mining. 	   The	Business	Value	of	Data We	are	now	witnessing	the	explosion	of	the	volume	of	raw	data	stored	in enterprise	databases.	From	quadrillions	of	credit	card	purchases	to	POS	sales	to byte-by-byte	raw	data	of	user	profiles,	databases	are	now	expressed	in Terabytes.	In	case	you	are	still	not	aware,	one	terabyte	is	equivalent	to	one trillion	bytes.	A	terabyte	is	equal	to	two	million	books.	For	example,	WalMart	is uploading	20	million	POS	transactions	every	day	to	a	large	parallel	system	with a	total	of	483	processors	running	a	central	database. But	by	itself,	raw	data	cannot	do	much.	In	the	competitive	business	setting nowadays,	businesses	should	quickly	transform	these	tons	of	raw	data	into valuable	insights	into	their	markets	that	can	be	used	in	their	management, investment,	and	marketing	strategies.			   Data	Storage The	reduction	of	price	of	data	storage	has	provided	companies	a	valuable resource:	data	about	their	target	market	stored	in	data	storage	houses.	Building and	running	data	warehouses	is	now	part	of	Big	Data	tech.	Data	storage	houses are	used	to	merge	data	situated	in	separate	databases.	A	data	storage	house	keeps huge	quantities	of	data	by	certain	categories,	for	easy	retrieval,	interpretation	and collation.	Storage	houses	enable	managers	and	executives	to	work	with	massive stores	of	transactional	or	other	data	to	react	faster	to	markets	and	make	better decisions	for	the	business.	It	has	been	projected	that	each	business	will	have	a separate	data	storage	for	the	next	decades.	However,	the	mere	act	of	storing	data in	these	warehouses	has	minimal	value	for	the	company.	Businesses	should	learn more	about	these	data	to	enhance	knowledge	of	their	markets	and	customers. The	company	will	certainly	benefit	if	meaningful	patterns	and	trends	are extracted	from	the	data. 	   So	What	is	Data	Mining? Data	Mining,	also	known	as	knowledge	discovery,	is	the	process	of	digging through	a	massive	volume	of	data	and	then	making	sense	of	the	data	through	IT strategies	and	tools,	which	can	project	future	trends	and	behaviors.	Through	data mining,	the	business	can	make	better	decisions.	The	tools	used	in	data	mining can	provide	answers	to	many	business	questions,	which	conventionally	require too	much	time	for	resolution.	Data	miners	can	dig	through	databases	for concealed	patterns,	searching	for	predictive	information	that	specialists	may miss	because	they	are	beyond	the	normal	pattern. The	term	data	mining	has	been	derived	from	the	similarities	between	looking	for valuable	information	in	massive	databases	and	mining	a	mountain	for	a	bit	of gold.	These	processes	need	either	probing	the	surface	to	find	the	location	of valuable	material	or	sift	through	tons	of	data. 	   How	Data	Mining	Can	Help	Your	Business Even	though	data	mining	is	still	in	its	early	stage,	businesses	in	various industries	such	as	aerospace,	transportation,	manufacturing,	healthcare,	finance, and	retail	are	now	using	data	mining	techniques	and	tools	to	make	sense	of	their accumulated	raw	data. Through	the	use	of	mathematical	or	statistical	strategies,	as	well	as	pattern recognition	tools	to	sieve	through	data	storage	information,	data	mining	could help	data	specialists	in	identifying	crucial	anomalies,	exceptions,	patterns, trends,	relationships,	and	facts	that	could	be	undiscovered.	For	many	businesses, data	mining	can	be	used	to	discover	relationships	and	patterns	in	the	data	for making	informed	decisions.	Data	mining	could	help	in	predicting	customer retention	with	high	accuracy	rate,	creation	of	innovative	marketing	and promotion	campaigns,	and	also	in	identifying	sales	trends.	Particular	use	of	data mining	involves:  Trend	analysis	-	discloses	the	distinction	between	customers	at	different time	period Market	basket	analysis	-	Understand	the	products	and	services	that	are often	purchased	side	by	side	such	as	bread	and	butter Interactive	marketing	-	Project	what	every	person	using	a	website	is most	interested	in	using Direct	Marketing	-	Determine	which	potential	clients	should	be	added	in a	mailing	list	to	acquire	the	best	response	rate Fraud	detection	-	Determine	which	transactions	are	often	fraudulent Market	segmentation	-	Determine	the	typical	traits	of	customers	who purchase	the	same	products	or	services	from	the	company Customer	churn	-	Project	which	customers	have	the	high	chances	to leave	your	company	and	patronize	your	competitors  	 Data	mining	technology	could	yield	new	opportunities	for	business	through projection	of	behaviors	and	trends	as	well	as	discovery	of	patterns	that	are unknown	before.   Data	mining	could	automate	the	process	of	searching	predictive	information	in	a huge	database.	Questions,	which	conventionally	needed	intensive	direct	analysis could	now	be	easily	answered	using	data.	A	usual	sample	of	projective	problem is	target	marketing.	With	data	mining,	you	can	use	data	on	previous	promotional mails	to	determine	the	targets	that	are	most	likely	to	increase	the	return	on investment	for	future	mails.	Other	projective	problems	such	as	predicting	the chance	for	bankruptcy	and	other	types	of	default,	and	determining	population segments	that	will	likely	respond	to	certain	events. Modern	tools	for	data	mining	could	scour	databases	and	determine	hidden patterns	in	the	past.	Another	example	of	pattern	discovery	is	the	evaluation	of retail	sales	data	to	determine	products,	which	are	regularly	bought	at	the	same time.	Detecting	fraud	for	online	transactions	as	well	as	determining	anomalous information,	which	could	signify	errors	in	data	entry. Through	massive	parallel	computers,	businesses	can	scour	through	tons	of	data to	reveal	patterns	about	their	products	and	customers.	For	instance,	grocery stores	have	discovered	that	when	men	are	shopping	for	diapers,	they	also purchase	with	beer.	With	this	information,	it	is	strategic	to	design	the	store	so that	the	diapers	and	beers	will	be	closer	to	each	other. Among	the	companies	who	are	using	data	mining	strategies	for	marketing	and sales	are	American	Express,	AC	Nielsen,	and	AT&T.	The	IT	and	Marketing departments	of	these	companies	are	poring	over	through	terabytes	of	POS	data	to help	analysts	in	analyzing	promotional	strategies	and	consumer	behavior.	This	is to	gain	a	competitive	advantage	and	increase	sales. Likewise,	financial	experts	are	studying	the	huge	sets	of	financial	data, information	fees,	as	well	as	other	sources	of	data	to	make	better	decisions.	For instance,	large	hospitals	are	studying	tons	of	medical	profiles	to	make	sense	of the	trends	of	the	past,	so	they	can	do	necessary	actions	to	decrease	the	future cost. 	   The	Data	Mining	Process How	can	you	use	data	mining	to	tell	you	crucial	information	that	you	are	not aware	of	or	what	will	happen	next?	The	technique	is	known	as	modeling,	which is	basically	the	act	of	creating	a	paradigm,	which	refers	to	the	set	of	examples	or mathematical	relationship	that	is	based	on	data	from	settings	where	the	answer	is known	and	will	apply	the	model	to	other	scenes	where	the	answers	are	not certain. Different	modeling	techniques	have	been	around	for	decades.	But	it	is	just	recent that	data	communication	and	storage	abilities	needed	to	acquire	and	store massive	amounts	of	data,	and	the	calculative	power	to	automate	techniques	for modeling	for	direct	data	access,	have	been	made	available. Let’s	illustrate	Let’s	say	that	you	are	the	VP	for	marketing	for	a	telecom company.	You	want	to	concentrate	your	marketing	and	sales	efforts	on population	segments	that	are	more	likely	to	become	long-term	users	of	long distance	telephone	service.	You	already	know	a	lot	about	your	customers,	but you	want	to	know	that	common	traits	of	your	best	clients.	There	are	many variables	however:	from	the	current	customer	database	that	contains	information like	gender,	age,	credit	rating,	occupation,	salary,	address,	and	other	information. You	can	use	tools	for	data	mining	such	as	neural	networks	in	order	to	identify the	characteristics	of	the	customers	who	are	usually	making	long	distance	calls several	times	per	week.	For	example,	you	may	learn	that	the	best	customer segment	is	the	one	that	comprise	single	men	between	the	age	of	30	to	45	who	are making	an	excess	of	$50,000	annually.	Hence,	this	will	be	your	model	for	high value	customers,	and	you	can	design	your	marketing	efforts	accordingly. 	   Technologies	for	Data	Mining The	analytical	strategies	used	in	data	mining	are	usually	popular	mathematical algorithms	and	strategies.	The	recent	innovation	is	the	application	of	these techniques	to	traditional	business	problems	thanks	to	the	increased	accessibility of	data	as	well	as	cheaper	cost	of	data	storage	and	processing.	In	addition,	the use	of	graphical	interfaces	has	resulted	to	the	tools	becoming	accessible,	which business	experts	could	use.	The	data	mining	tools	used	are	nearest	neighbor, genetic	algorithms,	rule	induction,	decision	trees,	and	artificial	neural	networks. The	nearest	neighbor	tool	refers	to	a	categorization	technique,	which	categorized every	record	based	on	the	data	most	similar	to	it	in	a	historical	database.	On	the other	hand,	genetic	algorithm	is	an	optimization	strategy	that	is	based	on	the paradigm	of	combining	natural	selection	as	well	as	genetic	combination. Decision	trees	are	tree-shaped	networks,	which	signify	decision	sets.	These decisions	yield	rules	for	the	dataset	classification.	Meanwhile,	artificial	neural networks	are	non-linear	projective	models,	which	can	learn	through	training	and resemble	biological	neural	networks	in	the	structure. 	   Examples	of	Applications	of	Data	Mining	in	Real	World	Setting Particular	information	such	as	people	who	are	using	the	phone	service,	and	if	a line	is	used	for	fax	or	voice	could	be	crucial	in	target	marketing	of	sales	of equipment	and	services	to	certain	customers.	However,	these	data	might	need scouring	as	they	are	often	buried	in	masses	of	database	numbers. By	going	into	the	intensive	client-call	database	to	handle	its	connection	network, the	telco	figured	out	new	forms	of	customer	needs	that	are	not	met	by	their competitors.	Through	its	data	mining	platform,	it	has	found	out	a	way	to determine	prospects	for	more	services	by	keeping	tab	of	every	day	household usage	for	certain	periods. For	instance,	residential	connections	who	make	extended	periods	of	calls	from	3 pm	to	6	pm	could	have	teenagers	who	are	may	want	to	have	their	own	phone lines.	If	the	company	chooses	to	employ	target	marketing,	which	emphasizes comfort	and	value	for	adults,	the	hidden	demand	has	been	revealed.	Lengthy phone	conversations	between	10	am	to	6	pm	signified	by	patterns	related	to	fax, voice,	and	modem	use	hints	that	the	customer	has	business	transactions.	The target	marketing	for	these	customers	could	be	business	communication	services which	could	lead	to	more	sales	for	equipment,	functions,	and	lines. A	business	will	have	a	powerful	advantage	if	it	has	the	capacity	to	measure	the customer	response	as	well	as	changes	in	the	business	rules.	A	bank	looking	for new	ways	to	increase	credit	card	subscription	experimented	on	an	option	by reducing	its	minimum	required	payment	by	50%	to	significantly	increase	the usage	of	credit	card	as	well	as	the	interest	earned.	With	hundreds	of	terabytes	of data	containing	three	years	of	average	credit	card	balances,	payment	timeliness, amount	of	payments,	credit	limit,	and	other	important	parameters.	Banks	are using	a	powerful	data	mining	tool	to	predict	the	impact	of	the	possible	change	in the	policy	on	certain	customer	categories	like	customers	who	are	constantly maxing	out	their	credit	limits.Many	banks	found	out	that	reducing	the	minimum payment	requirements	for	targeted	categories	of	customers	can	extend	the periods	of	indebtedness	and	increase	average	balance,	hence	raising	millions	of additional	earnings	from	interest. 	   Data	Mining	Prospects The	data	mining	results,	for	the	short-term	will	be	in	mundane,	profitable	and areas	of	business.	New	niches	will	be	explored	by	small	marketing	campaigns. Potential	customers	will	be	precisely	targeted	by	advertisements. Data	mining,	for	the	long-term	could	be	a	common	tool	not	only	for	businesses but	also	for	private	use.	Later	on,	you	may	use	data	mining	in	order	to	search	for the	cheapest	flight	tickets	to	Florida,	find	the	contact	details	of	a	long-lost childhood	friend,	or	find	the	best	prices	on	payday	loans. When	it	comes	to	long-term	data	mining	prospects	could	be	really	exciting. Competitive	agents	can	leverage	on	a	database	of	customer	personas	to	increase the	chance	to	close	a	deal	or	computers	could	reveal	new	cures	for	diseases	that are	impossible	to	treat	today. 	   Top	10	Ways	to	Get	a	Competitive	Edge	through	Data	Mining Many	companies	have	invested	in	equipment	and	development	of	systems	to collect	data	about	their	customers.	However,	only	very	few	businesses	are transforming	these	data	into	valuable	insights,	which	has	led	into	business advantages	such	as	increasing	customer	loyalty,	reducing	customer	attrition,	and unlocking	concealed	profitability.	Below	are	the	top	10	practical	ways	on	how you	can	use	data	mining. 	  1.	 Sales	Prediction	Analysis This	strategy	takes	a	look	at	the	time	customers	purchase	and	try	to	project when	they	will	purchase	again.	The	sales	prediction	analysis	can	be	used to	determine	a	strategy	for	planning	obsolescence	or	identify	other products	to	sell.	This	will	also	look	at	the	number	of	customers	in	your market	and	projects	how	many	customers	may	buy	a	certain	product.	For instance,	let’s	say	that	you	have	a	pizza	parlor	in	Newark,	NJ.	Below	are the	possible	questions	you	could	ask:  	  	  How	many	households	and	businesses	within	a	mile	of	your	pizza	parlor will	buy	your	pizza? Who	are	your	competitors	within	that	mile? How	many	households	and	businesses	are	there	in	five	miles? Who	are	your	competitors	within	five	miles?  In	sales	projection,	you	should	build	three	cash	flow	projections: pessimistic,	optimistic,	and	realistic.	With	this,	you	can	plan	to	have	the right	amount	of	capital	so	you	can	survive	when	worse	comes	to	worst	if your	sales	failed	to	go	as	planned.  	 2.	Planning	Merchandise   Planning	your	merchandise	is	beneficial	for	both	online	and	offline businesses.	When	it	comes	to	offline,	a	company	who	wants	to	grow through	expansion	could	analyze	the	amount	of	merchandise	they	want	by studying	at	the	exact	layout	of	a	present	store.	For	online	businesses, planning	the	merchandise	could	help	in	identifying	the	options	for	stocking as	well	as	the	warehouse	inventory.  The	best	approach	could	lead	to	answers,	which	can	help	you	in	deciding with	the	following	factors: 	  Stock	balancing	-	data	mining	can	help	in	identifying	the	right	stock amount	-	just	enough	amount	through	the	entire	year	and	purchasing trends. Managing	old	inventory	-	Planning	your	merchandise	could	be	as	plain as	updating	an	excel	sheet	to	update	the	stock Product	selection	-	Data	mining	could	help	in	figuring	out	which products	customers	like	that	must	involve	enough	data	and	information about	the	merchandise	of	your	competitors Pricing	-	Data	mining	can	help	in	identifying	the	best	price	for	your products	as	you	are	dealing	with	customer	sensitivity  Ignoring	the	need	for	merchandise	planning	could	lead	to	low	performance when	it	comes	to	customer	experience	as	well	as	production.	If	you	cannot manage	conventional	runs	on	a	product,	in-house	expectations	may	not	be met	or	the	price	may	not	match	the	market.	Your	clients	may	leave	you and	instead	patronize	your	competitors.  	  	  	 3.	Call	Records	Analysis  If	your	business	relies	on	telecommunications,	then	it	is	recommended	to mine	the	incoming	data	to	reveal	patterns,	set	up	customer	profiles	from these	patterns	and	then	develop	a	tiered	pricing	model	to	increase	your   profit.	You	can	even	build	promotions,	which	will	reflect	the	data. A	local	mobile	phone	service	provider	with	more	than	500,000	customers wants	to	analyze	their	data	to	launch	offerings	to	gain	competitive advantage.	The	first	thing	that	the	data	team	performed	after	collecting	and analyzing	data	was	to	develop	an	index	in	order	to	describe	the	behavior	of their	common	callers.	This	index	then	categorized	the	callers	into	eight segments	based	on	factors	such	as	this:  	  	  a.		local	call	percentage b.		IP	call	percentage c.			Call	percentage	for	idle	period	long	distance d.		Call	percentage	for	idle	period	roam e.		Average	minutes	of	usage	for	every	user f.				Percentage	for	local	call g.		Call	percentage	for	long	distance h.		Percentage	for	roaming  Using	this	data,	the	marketing	department	also	developed	strategies,	which created	at	every	segment	such	as	delivering	high-quality	SMS	service, better	caller	satisfaction	and	encouraging	another	customer	segment	to extend	more	minutes. Regardless	if	this	is	based	on	mobile	user	data	or	customer	service	calls,	it is	recommended	to	dig	into	the	available	data	to	find	ways	to	increase	the quality	of	service,	promote	opportunities	or	new	avenues	to	shorten	the time	on	call.  	 4.	Market	Segmentation Market	segmentation	is	one	of	the	best	uses	of	data	mining.	And	this	is	quite   simple.	Using	raw	data,	you	can	categorize	your	market	into	valuable	segments such	as	age,	gender,	income,	or	profession.	And	this	is	valuable	if	you	are working	on	your	SEO	strategies	or	running	your	email	marketing	campaigns. You	can	also	understand	your	competition	through	effective	market segmentation.	This	marketing	data	alone	could	help	you	in	determine	that	the common	suspects	are	not	the	only	ones	targeting	the	same	money	from	the customers	as	you	are. This	is	crucial	as	many	businesses	identify	their	competitors	through	memory. Through	data	mining,	you	can	find	more	competitors	so	you	can	plan	on	your strategy	to	fend	them	off.	Data	mining	could	help	you	do	this. Database	segmentation	could	improve	your	lead	conversion	rates	as	you concentrate	on	your	promotions	on	a	very	competitive	market.	And	this	could help	you	understand	your	competitors	in	every	segment,	which	allows	you	to customize	your	offerings	as	well	as	your	marketing	campaigns,	which	will satisfy	the	needs	of	the	customer,	which	is	more	effective	compared	to	a	broad, generic	marketing	tactics. 	 5.	Guarantees Data	mining	will	let	you	project	how	many	people	will	really	cash	in	on	the guarantees	you	have	offered.	This	is	also	true	for	warranties.	For	instance,	you can	test	the	pulling	power	of	a	guarantee	has	in	increasing	sales.	But	prior	to running	the	test,	you	first	need	to	evaluate	the	data	to	see	how	many	will	really return	the	products	that	you	are	selling.	You	must	look	at	the	available	data	on these	sets:	net	sales	and	settlements	request	within	the	parameters	of	the guarantee.	You	can	acquire	these	numbers	over	various	sales	sets	to	project	how many	people	will	cash	in	on	the	guarantee	and	will	then	adjust	the	guarantee amount	so	you	will	not	lose	too	much	money	if	customers	choose	to	return	the product.	These	computations	are	usually	more	complex	for	large	companies,	but for	smaller	businesses	there	is	no	need	to	be	complicated	than	this. Among	the	most	effective	ways	in	creating	the	best	guarantee	is	to	look	into	the data	of	past	profits,	sales,	and	guarantees.	With	this,	you	can	offer	a	110% money-back	guarantee	to	gain	a	competitive	advantage. 	   6.	Affinity	Analysis Also	known	as	basket	analysis,	affinity	analysis	examines	the	items	that	a customer	purchased	that	could	help	retailers	to	design	their	displays	or	online stores	to	suggest	related	products.	this	is	based	on	the	general	assumption	that you	can	project	the	future	client	behavior	by	previous	performance,	which includes	preferences	and	purchases.	And	it	is	not	just	retailers	who	can	use	this data	mining	tool.	Below	are	several	ways	that	you	can	apply	this	in	different industries:  a.	Fraud	detection	in	claiming	insurance By	digging	historical	records,	insurance	agencies	can	identify	claims	with a	high	percentage	of	recovering	money	that	have	been	lost	through	fraud and	design	rules	to	help	them	in	spotting	future	fraudulent	claims. b.	Assessment	of	Credit	Card	Use This	assessment	is	very	crucial	for	online	stores.	More	often	than	not professionals	dig	credit	card	details	to	discover	patterns	that	could	suggest fraud.	However,	the	data	can	also	be	used	to	tailor	cards	around	different credit	limits,	interest	rates,	terms	and	even	debt	collection. c.	Assessment	of	Phone	Use	Patterns For	example,	you	can	find	customers	who	use	all	of	the	latest	services	as well	as	features	that	your	phone	company	provides.	This	suggests	that	you need	more	offers	to	stick	around,	and	then	provide	them	perks	to	stay longer	in	the	service. Meanwhile,	there	it	is	not	necessary	for	the	products	to	be	purchased	at	the same	time.	Many	customer	analytic	tools	can	assess	purchases	in	different time	period,	which	helps	in	spotting	opportunities	and	trends,	which	you can	test	for	marketing	campaigns	in	the	future. Try	to	look	at	your	purchasing	data	and	spot	some	patterns.	Can	you	see customers	who	purchase	item	A	also	purchased	item	B?	Which	item	did they	purchased	first?	Why?	Can	you	encourage	customers	to	purchase	A, B,	and	C,	hence	increasing	your	sales?  7.	Database	Marketing   By	studying	patterns	for	customer	purchases	and	looking	at	the	psychographics and	demographics	of	customers	to	build	personas,	you	can	develop	products	and services	that	you	can	sell	to	them.	Certainly	for	a	marketer,	in	order	to	get	any kind	of	value	from	a	database,	it	should	constantly	develop	and	evolve.	You	feed database	information	from	questionnaires,	subscriptions,	surveys,	and	sales.	And then,	you	can	target	customers	based	on	this	information.	Database	marketing starts	with	data	collection.	For	instance,	if	you	have	a	small	restaurant,	your database	might	be	composed	of	this:  Campaigns	you	have	implemented	to	acquire	added	data	about	the location	of	your	customers Twitter	account,	which	doubles	as	a	promotion	and	customer	service avenue	where	you	can	receive	good	reviews	as	well	as	respond	on complaints	and	negative	feedback. Purchase	records	maintained	through	a	club	card,	which	you	offer through	incentives	such	as	a	5%	off	purchases	or	point	accumulation Specific	emails	you	have	used	to	update	customers	regularly,	but	also	to send	out	surveys	in	which	you	acquire	added	information	about	new offers	and	promotions.  As	you	acquire	data,	begin	looking	for	opportunities	such	as	best	months	to launch	a	discount	promo.	Be	sure	to	find	out	your	local	customers	and	how	you can	convert	these	customers	as	advocates	of	your	restaurant.		 8.	Card	Marketing If	the	enterprise	is	in	the	business	of	providing	credit	cards,	you	can	gather	the usage	data,	pinpoint	customer	segments,	and	then	through	the	information collected	on	these	segments,	you	can	develop	programs,	which	can	improve retention,	increase	acquisition,	set	out	prices,	and	identify	products	that	you	want to	develop. A	good	model	for	this	is	when	the	UN	has	decided	to	offer	Visa	credit	card	to individuals	who	are	frequently	flying	overseas.	The	marketing	division segmented	their	database	into	affluent	travelers	-	around	30,000	individuals	in high	income	segment.	The	marketing	division	decided	to	launch	this	offer through	direct	mail,	and	the	result	was	a	3%	response.	This	number	may	seem small,	but	for	industry	standards,	this	turn	out	exceeds	the	average.	Many   financial	organizations	usually	receive	0.5%	response	rate.	This	is	how	effective databases	could	be	when	it	comes	marketing	cards. Certainly,	issuing	credit	cards	can	be	costly,	which	many	companies	may	not have	the	funds.	But	if	you	can	do	it,	do	so.	Evaluating	customer	purchasing patterns	based	on	their	behavior	in	using	credit	card	will	provide	you	insight	into behavior,	which	could	result	to	promotions	and	programs	that	could	lead	to higher	revenues	and	improved	customer	retention. 9.	Customer	Retention In	the	business	world,	price	war	is	real.	You	can	obtain	customers	who	are	flying away	each	time	a	competitor	offers	lower	prices.	Data	mining	could	help	in reducing	this	churn,	particularly	with	social	media.	One	tool	that	you	can	use	is Spigit,	which	uses	various	data	mining	strategies	from	your	social	media customers	in	order	to	help	you	acquire	and	maintain	more	customers.	Spigit program	includes:  a.																Facebook	-	With	customer	clustering,	Spigit	can	use	the	data from	your	customers	on	Facebook	in	order	to	produce	ideas	to improve	your	brand,	increase	customer	satisfaction	and	boost customer	retention. b.															Employee	Innovation	-	This	tool	can	be	used	to	ask employees	for	their	ideas	on	how	to	enhance	customer	engagement, develop	products,	and	grow	the	business.	Hence,	data	mining	is	not always	about	customers	but	can	also	be	used	for	other	business	areas such	as	manpower. c.																FaceOff	-	This	app	could	be	used	by	people	who	want	to generate	ideas	on	which	they	can	vote.	For	instance,	one	person	may propose	“build	a	social	network	for	real	estate	investors”	versus “build	an	online	service	where	real	estate	investors	can	easily	create their	websites”.	Next,	members	will	be	shown	these	ideas	so	they	can vote.	Of	course,	this	will	allow	the	company	to	look	for	ideas	that	are coming	directly	from	their	customers,	and	voted	on	by	individuals who	could	be	interested	in	the	resulting	product	or	service.  Concentrating	on	numbers	such	as	Lifetime	Customer	Value	in	mining	data could	help	you	in	improving	your	acquisition	cost.	However,	this	could	also	help   you	determine	the	reasons	why	customers	are	leaving	your	business.		An integration	of	tactics	could	be	handy	in	this	case,	because	the	data	may	tell	you where	you	are	slacking	off.	You	may	have	to	use	some	questionnaires	and surveys	in	order	to	build	a	case	on	the	why. 10.	Product	Creation Data	mining	is	also	great	for	producing	customized	products	that	are	designed for	specific	market	segments.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	you	can	project	which	features customers	may	prefer,	even	though	genuine	products	that	are	innovative	are	not designed	from	providing	customers	what	they	like. Instead,	innovative	products	are	developed	when	you	assess	the	data	from	your customers	and	identify	holes	that	the	customers	are	looking	to	be	filled.	In creating	this	product,	these	are	the	factors	that	you	want	to	look	into:		  Unique	offering Aesthetic	design Could	be	sold	in	years	to	come Production	cost	is	cheap	enough	to	generate	profit Act	as	a	solution	for	an	obvious	need Positioned	to	enter	the	market	with	a	special	name Targets	a	large	market Make	an	impulse-purchase	pricing  Take	note	that	the	most	innovative	enterprises	never	begin	with	a	product.	They begin	with	a	pain	point	that	they	have	discovered	from	data	mining,	and	then develop	a	minimum	viable	product,	which	will	solve	this	problem	in	a	way	that the	target	market	never	suspected.	Implement	this	and	you	will	certainly	be ahead	of	your	competitors.   Conclusion The	more	data	you	gather	from	your	customers,	the	more	value	you	can	provide to	them.	And	the	more	you	can	deliver	to	the,	the	higher	the	profit	you	can	make. Data	mining	is	what	could	help	you	do	this.	Hence,	if	you	are	just	sitting	on	tons of	customer	data	and	you	are	not	doing	anything,	you	need	to	make	a	plan	to begin	digging	in	today. I	hope	you	found	this	no-fluff	book	informative	and	enjoyable	to	read! Vince	Reynolds
