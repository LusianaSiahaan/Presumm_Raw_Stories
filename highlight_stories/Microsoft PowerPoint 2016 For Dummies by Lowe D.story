Do	you	ever	find	yourself	in	front	of	an	audience,	no	matter	how	small,	flipping through	flip	charts	or	shuffling	through	a	stack	of	handwritten	transparencies?	You need	PowerPoint!	Have	you	always	wanted	to	take	your	notebook	computer	with	you to	impress	a	client	at	lunch,	but	you	haven’t	known	what	to	do	with	it	between	trips	to the	salad	bar?	You	really	need	PowerPoint! Or	maybe	you’re	one	of	those	unfortunate	folks	who	bought	Microsoft	Office	because it	was	such	a	bargain	and	you	needed	a	Windows	word	processor	and	spreadsheet anyway,	and	hey,	you’re	not	even	sure	what	PowerPoint	is,	but	it	came	with	the software	you	purchased,	so	it	didn’t	cost	extra.	Who	can	resist	a	bargain	like	that? Whichever	circumstance	you	find	yourself	in,	you’re	holding	the	perfect	book	right here	in	your	formerly	magic-marker-stained	hands.	Help	is	here,	within	these	humble pages. This	book	talks	about	PowerPoint	in	everyday	—	and	often	irreverent	—	terms.	No lofty	prose	here;	the	whole	thing	checks	in	at	about	the	fifth-grade	reading	level.	I	have no	Pulitzer	expectations	for	this	book.	My	goal	is	to	make	an	otherwise	dull	and	lifeless subject	at	least	tolerable,	and	maybe	even	kind	of	fun.   About	This	Book  This	isn’t	the	kind	of	book	that	you	pick	up	and	read	from	start	to	finish	as	though	it were	a	cheap	novel.	If	I	ever	see	you	reading	it	at	the	beach,	I’ll	kick	sand	in	your	face. This	book	is	more	like	a	reference	—	the	kind	of	book	you	can	pick	up,	turn	to	just about	any	page,	and	start	reading.	It	has	22	chapters,	each	one	covering	a	specific aspect	of	using	PowerPoint	—	such	as	printing,	animating	your	slides,	or	using	clip	art. You	don’t	have	to	memorize	anything	in	this	book.	It’s	a	need-to-know	book:	You	pick it	up	when	you	need	to	know	something.	Need	to	know	how	to	create	an	organization chart?	Pick	up	the	book.	Need	to	know	how	to	override	the	Slide	Master?	Pick	up	the book.	After	you	find	what	you’re	looking	for,	put	it	down	and	get	on	with	your	life. I	use	a	few	conventions	to	communicate	information:  Keyboard	shortcuts:	On	occasion,	this	book	directs	you	to	use	specific	keyboard shortcuts	to	get	things	done.	When	you	see	something	like	Ctrl+Z,	this	instruction means	to	hold	down	the	Ctrl	key	while	pressing	the	Z	key	and	then	release	both together.	Don’t	type	the	plus	sign. Commands:	Sometimes	I	tell	you	to	use	a	command	that	resides	on	the	new Ribbon	interface	like	this:	Choose	Home ⇒ Editing ⇒ Find.	That	means	to	click	the Find	button,	which	you	can	find	in	the	Editing	group	on	the	Home	tab. Onscreen	messages:	Whenever	I	describe	a	message	or	information	that	you	see onscreen,	it	looks	like	this: Are	we	having	fun	yet?  Buttons	in	the	margin:	Whenever	I	discuss	a	certain	button	that	you	need	to	click in	order	to	accomplish	the	task	at	hand,	the	button	appears	either	in	the	margin	or	in a	helpful	table	that	summarizes	the	buttons	that	apply	to	a	particular	task.	This	way, you	can	easily	locate	it	on	your	screen. Bold	text:	Type	bold	text	just	as	it	appears	in	the	book.	The	exception	is	when you’re	working	through	a	steps	list:	Because	each	step	is	bold,	the	text	to	type	is not	bold. Monofont:	Web	addresses	and	programming	code	appear	in	monofont.	If	you’re reading	a	digital	version	of	this	book	on	a	device	connected	to	the	Internet,	you	can click	the	web	address	to	visit	that	website,	like	this:	www.dummies.com.   Foolish	Assumptions  I	make	only	three	assumptions	about	you:  You	use	a	computer. It’s	a	Windows	computer	—	not	a	Mac.	 PowerPoint	2016	requires	at	least Windows	7.  You	use	or	are	thinking	about	using	PowerPoint	2016.  Nothing	else.	I	don’t	assume	that	you’re	a	computer	guru	who	knows	how	to	change	a controller	card	or	configure	memory	for	optimal	use.	These	types	of	computer	chores are	best	handled	by	people	who	like	computers.	My	hope	is	that	you’re	on	speaking terms	with	such	a	person.	Do	your	best	to	stay	there.   Icons	Used	in	This	Book  As	you’re	reading	all	this	wonderful	prose,	you	occasionally	see	the	following	icons. They	appear	in	the	margins	to	draw	your	attention	to	important	information.	They’re defined	as	follows:  	Watch	out!	Some	technical	drivel	is	just	around	the	corner.	Read	it	only	if	you  have	your	pocket	protector	firmly	attached.  	Pay	special	attention	to	this	icon	—	it	tells	you	that	some	particularly	useful tidbit	is	at	hand,	perhaps	a	shortcut	or	a	way	of	using	a	command	that	you	might not	have	considered.  	Danger!	Danger!	Danger!	Stand	back,	Will	Robinson!  	Did	I	tell	you	about	the	memory	course	I	took?	Paragraphs	marked	with	this  icon	simply	point	out	details	that	are	worth	committing	to	memory.   Beyond	the	Book  I	couldn’t	fit	everything	about	PowerPoint	2016	in	these	pages,	so	you	can	go	online	to find	even	more	information:  Cheat	Sheet:	Go	to	www.dummies.com cheatsheet powerpoint2016	to	find	a variety	of	shortcuts	for	everything	from	formatting	and	editing	to	slide	shows	and more. Web	Extras:	Go	to	www.dummies.com extras powerpoint2016	to	access	articles on	how	to	add	recurring	text,	how	to	create	a	hyperlink	to	another	slide,	how	to	add comments	to	presentations,	and	more.   Where	to	Go	from	Here  Yes,	you	can	get	there	from	here.	With	this	book	in	hand,	you’re	ready	to	charge	full speed	ahead	into	the	strange	and	wonderful	world	of	desktop	presentations.	Browse through	the	table	of	contents	and	decide	where	you	want	to	start.	Be	bold!	Be courageous!	Be	adventurous!	Above	all	else,	have	fun!

Chapter	1   Welcome	to	PowerPoint	2016  In	This	Chapter  	Discovering	PowerPoint 	Firing	up	PowerPoint 	Making	sense	of	the	PowerPoint	screen	and	the	Ribbon 	Visiting	backstage 	Creating	a	presentation 	Viewing	presentation	outlines 	Saving	and	closing	your	work 	Retrieving	a	presentation	from	the	hard	drive 	Getting	help 	Getting	out	of	PowerPoint  This	chapter	is	a	grand	and	gala	welcoming	ceremony	for	PowerPoint	2016, Microsoft’s	popular	slide-presentation	program. This	chapter	is	sort	of	like	the	opening	ceremony	of	the	Olympics,	in	which	all	the athletes	parade	around	the	stadium	and	people	make	speeches	in	French.	In	much	the same	way,	this	chapter	marches	PowerPoint	2016	around	the	stadium	so	you	can	get	a bird’s-eye	view	of	what	the	program	is	and	what	you	can	do	with	it.	I	might	make	a few	speeches,	but	not	in	French	 unless,	of	course,	you’re	reading	the	French	edition	of this	book .   What	in	Sam	Hill	Is	PowerPoint?  PowerPoint	is	a	program	that	comes	with	Microsoft	Office	 although	you	can	buy	it separately,	as	well .	Most	people	buy	Microsoft	Office	because	it’s	a	great	bargain:	You get	Word,	Excel,	and	Outlook	all	together	in	one	inexpensive	package.	And	PowerPoint is	thrown	in	for	good	measure.	Of	course,	depending	on	which	edition	of	Office	you buy,	you	might	get	other	goodies	as	well,	such	as	Access,	Publisher,	a	complete	set	of Ginsu	knives,	and	a	Binford	VegaPneumatic	Power	Slicer	and	Dicer.	 Always	wear	eye protection.  You	know	what	Word	is	—	it’s	the	world’s	most	loved	and	most	hated	word	processor, and	it’s	perfect	for	concocting	letters,	term	papers,	and	great	American	novels.	I’m thinking	of	writing	one	as	soon	as	I	finish	this	book.	Excel	is	a	spreadsheet	program used	by	bean	counters	the	world	over.	Outlook	is	that	program	you	use	to	read	your email.	But	what	the	heck	is	PowerPoint?	Does	anybody	know	or	care?	 And	as	long	as I’m	asking	questions,	who	in	Sam	Hill	was	Sam	Hill?  PowerPoint	is	a	presentation	program,	and	it’s	one	of	the	coolest	programs	I	know.	It’s designed	to	work	with	a	projector	to	display	presentations	that	will	bedazzle	your audience	members	and	instantly	sway	them	to	your	point	of	view,	even	if	you’re	selling real	estate	on	Mars,	season	tickets	for	the	Oakland	Raiders,	or	a	new	tax	increase	to	a congressman	in	an	election	year.	If	you’ve	ever	flipped	a	flip	chart,	you’re	going	to love	PowerPoint. Here	are	some	of	the	many	uses	of	PowerPoint:  Business	presentations:	PowerPoint	is	a	great	timesaver	for	anyone	who	makes business	presentations,	whether	you’ve	been	asked	to	speak	in	front	of	hundreds	of people	at	a	shareholders’	convention,	a	group	of	sales	reps	at	a	sales	conference,	or your	own	staff	or	co-workers	at	a	business	meeting. Sales	presentations:	If	you’re	an	insurance	salesperson,	you	can	use	PowerPoint	to create	a	presentation	about	the	perils	of	not	owning	life	insurance	and	then	use	your laptop	or	tablet	computer	to	show	it	to	hapless	clients. Lectures:	PowerPoint	is	useful	for	teachers	or	conference	speakers	who	want	to reinforce	the	key	points	in	their	lectures	with	slides. Homework:	PowerPoint	is	a	great	program	to	use	for	certain	types	of	homework projects,	such	as	those	big	history	reports	that	count	for	half	your	grade. Church:	People	use	PowerPoint	at	churches	to	display	song	lyrics	on	big	screens so	everyone	can	sing	or	to	display	sermon	outlines	so	everyone	can	take	notes.	If your	church	still	uses	hymnals	or	prints	the	outline	in	the	bulletin,	tell	the	minister to	join	the	21st	century. Information	stations:	You	can	use	PowerPoint	to	set	up	a	computerized information	kiosk	that	people	can	walk	up	to	and	use.	For	example,	you	can	create a	museum	exhibit	about	the	history	of	your	town	or	set	up	a	tradeshow	presentation   to	provide	information	about	your	company	and	products. Internet	presentations:	PowerPoint	can	even	help	you	to	set	up	a	presentation	that you	can	broadcast	over	the	Internet	so	people	can	join	in	on	the	fun	without	having to	leave	the	comfort	of	their	own	homes	or	offices.   Introducing	PowerPoint	Presentations  PowerPoint	is	similar	to	a	word	processor	such	as	Word,	except	that	it’s	geared	toward creating	presentations	rather	than	documents.	A	presentation	is	kind	of	like	those Kodak	Carousel	slide	trays	that	your	grandpa	filled	up	with	35mm	slides	of	the	time	he took	the	family	to	the	Grand	Canyon	in	1965.	The	main	difference	is	that	with PowerPoint,	you	don’t	have	to	worry	about	dumping	all	the	slides	out	of	the	tray	and figuring	out	how	to	get	them	back	into	the	right	order. Word	documents	consist	of	one	or	more	pages,	and	PowerPoint	presentations	consist	of one	or	more	slides.	Each	slide	can	contain	text,	graphics,	animations,	videos,	and	other information.	You	can	easily	rearrange	the	slides	in	a	presentation,	delete	slides	that	you don’t	need,	add	new	slides,	or	modify	the	contents	of	existing	slides. You	can	use	PowerPoint	both	to	create	your	presentations	and	to	actually	present	them. You	can	use	several	different	types	of	media	to	actually	show	your	presentations:  Computer	screen:	Your	computer	screen	is	a	suitable	way	to	display	your presentation	when	you’re	showing	it	to	just	one	or	two	other	people. Big-screen	TV:	If	you	have	a	big-screen	TV	that	can	accommodate	computer	input, it’s	ideal	for	showing	presentations	to	medium-sized	audiences	—	say	10	to	12 people	in	a	small	conference	room. Computer	projector:	A	computer	projector	projects	an	image	of	your	computer monitor	onto	a	screen	so	large	audiences	can	view	it. Webcast:	You	can	show	your	presentation	over	the	Internet.	That	way,	your audience	doesn’t	all	have	to	be	in	the	same	place	at	the	same	time.	Anyone	with	a web	browser	can	sit	in	on	your	presentation. Printed	pages:	Printed	pages	enable	you	to	distribute	a	printed	copy	of	your	entire presentation	to	each	member	of	your	audience.	 When	you	print	your	presentation, you	can	print	one	slide	per	page,	or	you	can	print	several	slides	on	each	page	to save	paper.  Overhead	transparencies:	Overhead	transparencies	can	be	used	to	show	your presentation	using	an	overhead	projector.	It’s	a	little	old-school	to	be	sure,	but	some people	still	do	it	this	way.  Your	presentations	will	be	much	more	interesting	if	you	show	them	using	one	of	the first	four	methods	 computer	monitor,	TV,	projector,	or	webcast 	because	you	can incorporate	animations,	videos,	sounds,	and	other	whiz-bang	features	in	your presentation.	Printed	pages,	overheads,	and	35mm	slides	can	show	only	static	content. Presentation	files A	presentation	is	to	PowerPoint	what	a	document	is	to	Word	or	a	worksheet	is	to	Excel. In	other	words,	a	presentation	is	a	file	that	you	create	with	PowerPoint.	Each   presentation	that	you	create	is	saved	on	your	computer’s	hard	drive	as	a	separate	file. PowerPoint	2016	presentations	have	the	special	extension	.pptx	added	to	the	end	of their	filenames.	For	example,	Sales	Conference.pptx	and	History	Day.pptx	are	both valid	PowerPoint	filenames.	When	you	type	the	filename	for	a	new	PowerPoint	file, you	don’t	have	to	type	the	.pptx	extension,	because	PowerPoint	automatically	adds	the extension	for	you.	Windows	may	hide	the	.pptx	extension,	in	which	case	a	presentation file	named	Conference.pptx	often	appears	as	just	Conference.  	I	recommend	you	avoid	the	use	of	spaces	and	special	characters,	especially  percent	signs	 % ,	in	your	filenames.	If	you	want	the	effect	of	a	space	in	a filename,	use	an	underscore	character	instead.	Spaces	and	percent	signs	in filenames	can	cause	all	kinds	of	problems	if	you	post	your	presentation	files	to	the Internet,	either	on	a	web	page	or	even	as	a	File	Transfer	Protocol	 FTP 	upload.  	Versions	of	PowerPoint	prior	to	2007	save	presentations	with	the	extension	.ppt  instead	of	.pptx.	The	x	at	the	end	of	the	newer	file	extension	denotes	that	the	new file	format	is	based	on	an	open	XML	standard	data	format	that	makes	it	easier	to exchange	files	among	different	programs.	PowerPoint	2016	can	still	save	files	in the	old	.ppt	format,	but	I	recommend	you	do	so	only	if	you	need	to	share presentations	with	people	who	haven’t	yet	upgraded	to	PowerPoint	2007	or	later. PowerPoint	is	set	up	initially	to	save	your	presentation	files	in	the	Documents	folder, but	you	can	store	PowerPoint	files	in	any	folder	of	your	choice	on	your	hard	drive	or on	any	other	drive.	You	can	also	save	your	presentation	to	online	file	storage,	such	as Microsoft’s	OneDrive.	And,	if	you	wish,	you	can	write	a	presentation	to	a	USB	flash drive	or	to	cloud	storage. What’s	in	a	slide? PowerPoint	presentations	comprise	one	or	more	slides.	Each	slide	can	contain	text, graphics,	and	other	elements.	A	number	of	PowerPoint	features	work	together	to	help you	easily	format	attractive	slides:  Slide	layouts:	Every	slide	has	a	slide	layout	that	controls	how	information	is arranged	on	the	slide.	A	slide	layout	is	simply	a	collection	of	one	or	more placeholders,	which	set	aside	an	area	of	the	slide	to	hold	information.	Depending on	the	layout	that	you	choose	for	a	slide,	the	placeholders	can	hold	text,	graphics, clip	art,	sound	or	video	files,	tables,	charts,	graphs,	diagrams,	or	other	types	of content. Background:	Every	slide	has	a	background,	which	provides	a	backdrop	for	the slide’s	content.	The	background	can	be	a	solid	color;	a	blend	of	two	colors;	a	subtle texture,	such	as	marble	or	parchment;	a	pattern,	such	as	diagonal	lines,	bricks,	or   tiles;	or	an	image	file.	Each	slide	can	have	a	different	background,	but	you	usually want	to	use	the	same	background	for	every	slide	in	your	presentation	to	provide	a consistent	look. Themes:	Themes	are	combinations	of	design	elements	such	as	color	schemes	and fonts	that	make	it	easy	to	create	attractive	slides	that	don’t	look	ridiculous.	You	can stray	from	the	themes	if	you	want,	but	you	should	do	so	only	if	you	have	a	better eye	than	the	design	gurus	who	work	for	Microsoft. Slide	Masters:	Slide	Masters	are	special	slides	that	control	the	basic	design	and formatting	options	for	slides	in	your	presentation.	Slide	Masters	are	closely	related to	layouts	—	in	fact,	each	layout	has	its	own	Slide	Master	that	determines	the position	and	size	of	basic	title	and	text	placeholders;	the	background	and	color scheme	used	for	the	presentation;	and	font	settings,	such	as	typefaces,	colors,	and sizes.	In	addition,	Slide	Masters	can	contain	graphic	and	text	objects	that	you	want to	appear	on	every	slide. You	can	edit	the	Slide	Masters	to	change	the	appearance	of	all	the	slides	in	your presentation	at	once.	This	helps	to	ensure	that	the	slides	have	a	consistent appearance.  All	the	features	described	in	the	preceding	list	work	together	to	control	the	appearance of	your	slides	in	much	the	same	way	that	style	sheets	and	templates	control	the appearance	of	Word	documents.	You	can	customize	the	appearance	of	individual	slides by	adding	any	of	the	following	elements:  Title	and	body	text:	Most	slide	layouts	include	placeholders	for	title	and	body text.	You	can	type	any	text	that	you	want	into	these	placeholders.	By	default, PowerPoint	formats	the	text	according	to	the	Slide	Master,	but	you	can	easily override	this	formatting	to	use	any	font,	size,	styles	like	bold	or	italic,	or	text	color that	you	want. Text	boxes:	You	can	add	text	anywhere	on	a	slide	by	drawing	a	text	box	and	then typing	text.	Text	boxes	enable	you	to	add	text	that	doesn’t	fit	conveniently	in	the title	or	body	text	placeholders. Shapes:	You	can	use	PowerPoint’s	drawing	tools	to	add	a	variety	of	shapes	to	your slides.	You	can	use	predefined	AutoShapes,	such	as	rectangles,	circles,	stars, arrows,	and	flowchart	symbols.	Alternatively,	you	can	create	your	own	shapes	by using	basic	line,	polygon,	and	freehand	drawing	tools. Illustrations:	You	can	illustrate	your	slides	by	inserting	clip	art,	photographs,	and other	graphic	elements.	PowerPoint	comes	with	a	large	collection	of	clip	art pictures	you	can	use,	and	Microsoft	provides	an	even	larger	collection	of	clip	art images	online.	And,	of	course,	you	can	insert	photographs	from	your	own	picture library. Charts	and	diagrams:	PowerPoint	includes	a	slick	diagramming	feature	called SmartArt	that	enables	you	to	create	several	common	types	of	diagrams,	including   organization	charts,	cycle	diagrams,	and	others.	In	addition,	you	can	insert	pie charts,	line	or	bar	charts,	and	many	other	chart	types. Video	and	Sound:	You	can	add	sound	clips	or	video	files	to	your	slides.	You	can also	add	background	music	or	a	custom	narration.   Starting	PowerPoint  Here’s	the	procedure	for	starting	PowerPoint	in	Windows	8,	8.1,	or	10:  1.	 Get	ready.  Light	some	votive	candles.	Take	two	Tylenol.	Put	on	a	pot	of	coffee.	If	you’re allergic	to	banana	slugs,	take	an	allergy	pill.	Sit	in	the	lotus	position	facing Redmond,	Washington,	and	recite	the	Windows	creed	three	times: Microsoft	is	my	friend.	Resistance	is	futile.	No	beer	and	no	TV	make	Homer something	something	…	.  2.	 Press	the	Windows	key	on	your	keyboard.  The	Windows	key	is	the	one	that	has	the	fancy	Windows	flag	printed	on	it.	On	most keyboards,	it’s	located	between	the	Alt	and	Tab	keys.	When	you	press	this	button, Windows	brings	up	the	Start	page,	which	lists	your	commonly	used	applications	in large	tiles.  3.	 Click	the	PowerPoint	2016	tile.  That’s	all	there	is	to	it	—	PowerPoint	starts	up	in	a	flash.	 Note	that	you	might	have to	scroll	the	Start	screen	to	the	right	to	find	the	PowerPoint	2016	tile.   If	you’re	using	Windows	7,	the	procedure	is	a	little	different:  1.	 Click	the	Start	button.  The	Start	button	is	ordinarily	found	in	the	lower-left	corner	of	the	Windows	display. When	you	click	it,	the	Start	menu	appears.	The	Start	menu	works	pretty	much	the same,	no	matter	which	version	of	Windows	you're	using.  	If	you	can’t	find	the	Start	button,	try	moving	the	cursor	all	the	way	to	the bottom	edge	of	the	screen	and	holding	it	there	a	moment.	With	luck	on	your	side, you	see	the	Start	button	appear.	If	not,	try	moving	the	cursor	to	the	other	three edges	of	the	screen:	top,	left,	and	right.	Sometimes	the	Start	button	hides	behind these	edges.  2.	 Point	to	All	Programs	on	the	Start	menu.  After	you	click	the	Start	button	to	reveal	the	Start	menu,	move	the	cursor	up	to	the words	All	Programs	and	hold	it	there	a	moment.	Yet	another	menu	appears, revealing	a	bevy	of	commands.  3.	 Choose	Microsoft	Office ⇒ Microsoft	Office	PowerPoint	2016.  Your	computer	whirs	and	clicks	and	possibly	makes	other	unmentionable	noises while	PowerPoint	comes	to	life.   	If	you	use	PowerPoint	frequently,	it	might	appear	in	the	Frequently	Used  Programs	list	directly	on	the	Start	menu	so	you	don’t	have	to	choose	All Programs ⇒ Microsoft	Office	to	get	to	it.	If	you	want	PowerPoint	to	always appear	at	the	top	of	the	Start	menu,	choose	Start ⇒ All	Programs ⇒ Microsoft Office.	Then,	right-click	Microsoft	Office	PowerPoint	2016	and	choose	the	Pin	to Start	Menu	command.  	If	you	hate	clicking	through	menus	but	don’t	mind	typing,	another	way	to	start PowerPoint	is	to	press	your	keyboard’s	Windows	key	 usually	found	between	the Ctrl	and	Alt	keys ,	type	the	word	powerpoint,	and	press	the	Enter	key.	 Note	that this	trick	works	only	in	Windows	7.    Navigating	the	PowerPoint	Interface  When	you	start	PowerPoint,	it	greets	you	with	the	screen	shown	in	Figure	1-1.	This screen	lets	you	create	a	blank	presentation,	open	a	recently	used	presentation,	or	create a	new	presentation	based	on	a	template.	You	can	also	take	a	video	tour	of	PowerPoint.  Figure	1-1:	PowerPoint’s	opening	screen.  For	the	purposes	of	this	chapter,	click	Blank	Presentation	to	get	started	with	a	new presentation.	You	will	next	be	greeted	with	a	screen	that’s	so	cluttered	with	stuff	that you’re	soon	ready	to	consider	newsprint	and	markers	as	a	viable	alternative	for	your presentations.	The	center	of	the	screen	is	mercifully	blank,	but	the	top	part	of	the screen	is	chock-full	of	little	icons	and	buttons	and	doohickeys.	What	is	all	that	stuff? Figure	1-2	shows	the	basic	PowerPoint	screen	in	all	its	cluttered	glory.	The	following list	points	out	the	more	important	parts	of	the	PowerPoint	screen:   Figure	1-2:	PowerPoint’s	cluttered	screen.  Ribbon:	Across	the	top	of	the	screen,	just	below	the	Microsoft	PowerPoint	title,	is PowerPoint’s	main	user-interface	gadget,	called	the	Ribbon.	If	you’ve	worked	with earlier	versions	of	PowerPoint,	you	were	probably	expecting	to	see	a	menu followed	by	one	or	more	toolbars	in	this	general	vicinity.	After	meticulous	research, Microsoft	gurus	decided	that	menus	and	toolbars	are	hard	to	use.	So	they	replaced the	menus	and	toolbars	with	the	Ribbon,	which	combines	the	functions	of	both.	The Ribbon	takes	some	getting	used	to,	but	after	you	figure	it	out,	it	actually	does become	easier	to	use	than	the	old	menus	and	toolbars.	The	deepest	and	darkest secrets	of	PowerPoint	are	hidden	on	the	Ribbon.	Wear	a	helmet	when	exploring	it. Note	that	the	exact	appearance	of	the	Ribbon	varies	a	bit	depending	on	the	size	of your	monitor.	On	smaller	monitors,	PowerPoint	may	compress	the	Ribbon	a	bit	by using	smaller	buttons	and	arranging	them	differently	 for	example,	stacking	them on	top	of	one	another	instead	of	placing	them	side	by	side . For	more	information	about	working	with	the	Ribbon,	see	the	section	“Unraveling the	Ribbon,”	later	in	this	chapter. File	tab:	The	first	tab	on	the	Ribbon	is	called	the	File	tab.	You	can	click	it	to	switch the	program	into	a	special	mode	called	Backstage	View,	which	provides	access	to various	functions	such	as	opening	and	saving	files,	creating	new	presentations, printing,	and	other	similar	chores.	For	more	information,	see	the	section	“Taking the	Backstage	Tour,”	later	in	this	chapter. Quick	Access	toolbar:	Just	above	the	Ribbon	is	the	Quick	Access	toolbar,	also   called	the	QAT	for	short.	Its	sole	purpose	in	life	is	to	provide	a	convenient	resting place	for	the	PowerPoint	commands	you	use	the	most	often. Initially,	this	toolbar	contains	just	three:	Save,	Undo,	and	Redo.	However,	you	can add	more	buttons	if	you	want.	To	add	any	button	to	the	QAT,	right-click	the	button and	choose	Add	to	Quick	Access	Toolbar.	You	can	also	find	a	pull-down	menu	at the	end	of	the	QAT	that	lists	several	frequently	used	commands.	You	can	use	this menu	to	add	these	common	commands	to	the	QAT. Current	slide:	Right	smack	in	the	middle	of	the	screen	is	where	your	current	slide appears. Slides	pane:	To	the	left	of	the	slide	is	an	area	that	shows	thumbnail	icons	of	your slides.	You	can	use	this	area	to	easily	navigate	to	other	slides	in	your	presentation. Task	pane:	To	the	right	of	the	slide	is	an	area	called	the	task	pane.	The	task	pane	is designed	to	help	you	complete	common	tasks	quickly.	When	you	first	start PowerPoint,	the	task	pane	isn’t	visible,	so	you	can’t	see	it	in	Figure	1-1.	However, it	appears	whenever	it’s	needed,	and	you	can	see	plenty	of	examples	of	it throughout	this	book. Status	bar:	At	the	very	bottom	of	the	screen	is	the	status	bar,	which	tells	you	the slide	that	is	currently	displayed	 for	example,	Slide	1	of	1 .  	You	can	configure	the	status	bar	by	right-clicking	anywhere	on	it.	This right-click	reveals	a	list	of	options	that	you	can	select	or	deselect	to	determine which	elements	appear	on	the	status	bar. Zoom	control:	PowerPoint	automatically	adjusts	its	zoom	factor	so	that	Slide	View displays	each	slide	in	its	entirety.	You	can	change	the	size	of	your	slide	by	using	the zoom	control	slider	that	appears	at	the	bottom	right	of	the	window.  	You’ll	never	get	anything	done	if	you	feel	that	you	have	to	understand	every  pixel	of	the	PowerPoint	screen	before	you	can	do	anything.	Don’t	worry	about	the stuff	that	you	don’t	understand;	just	concentrate	on	what	you	need	to	know	to	get the	job	done	and	worry	about	the	bells	and	whistles	later.   Unraveling	the	Ribbon  The	Ribbon	is	Microsoft’s	primary	user	interface	gadget.	Across	the	top	of	the	Ribbon is	a	series	of	tabs.	You	can	click	one	of	these	tabs	to	reveal	a	set	of	controls	specific	to that	tab.	For	example,	the	Ribbon	in	Figure	1-2	 earlier	in	the	chapter 	shows	the	Home tab.	Figure	1-3	shows	the	Ribbon	with	the	Insert	tab	selected.  Figure	1-3:	The	Ribbon	with	the	Insert	tab	selected.  Initially,	the	Ribbon	displays	the	tabs	described	in	Table	1-1. Table	1-1	Basic	Tabs	on	the	Ribbon  Tab  File  Home  Insert  Actions	You	Can	Perform  Open,	close,	print,	and	share	presentations  Create	and	format	slides  Insert	various	types	of	objects	on	slides  Design  Tweak	the	layout	of	a	slide  Animations Add	animation	effects	to	your	slides  Slide	Show Present	your	slide	show  Review  Proof	and	add	comments	to	your	presentations  View  Change	the	view  Transitions Change	the	transition	effects	that	are	applied	when	you	switch	from	one	slide	to	the	next  Besides	these	basic	tabs,	additional	tabs	appear	from	time	to	time.	For	example,	if	you select	a	picture,	a	Picture	Tools	tab	appears	with	commands	that	let	you	manipulate	the picture. The	commands	on	a	Ribbon	tab	are	organized	into	groups.	Within	each	group,	most	of the	commands	are	simple	buttons	that	are	similar	to	toolbar	buttons	in	previous versions	of	PowerPoint.   Telling	PowerPoint	What	to	Do  The	Ribbon	contains	scores	of	buttons	that	enable	you	to	use	any	of	PowerPoint’s many	features	for	creating	and	formatting	slides.	Unfortunately,	the	Ribbon	can sometimes	be	difficult	to	navigate,	and	if	you’re	like	me,	you’ll	often	find	yourself unsure	of	which	Ribbon	tab	contains	the	button	you’re	looking	for. That’s	where	the	Tell	Me	What	to	Do	box	comes	in.	This	search	box	is	located	above the	right	side	of	the	Ribbon.	Type	what	you	want	to	do	in	this	box	and	PowerPoint	will take	you	directly	to	the	Ribbon	button	that	lets	you	do	it.	For	example,	if	you	type Open,	the	Open	button	from	the	File	menu	appears.	This	feature	can	be	a	great timesaver	when	you	know	what	you	want	to	do	but	you	aren’t	sure	exactly	where	in	the Ribbon	the	correct	button	is	located.   The	View	from	Here	Is	Great  Near	the	right	edge	of	the	status	bar	is	a	series	of	four	View	buttons.	These	buttons enable	you	to	switch	among	the	various	views,	or	ways	of	looking	at	your	presentation. Table	1-2	summarizes	what	each	View	button	does. Table	1-2	View	Buttons  Button What	It	Does  Switches	to	Normal	View,	which	shows	your	slide,	outline,	and	notes	all	at	once.	This	is	the	default	view	for	PowerPoint.  Switches	to	Slide	Sorter	View,	which	enables	you	to	easily	rearrange	slides	and	add	slide	transitions	and	other	special effects.  Switches	to	Reading	View,	which	displays	your	slide	show	within	a	window.  Switches	to	Slide	Show	View,	which	displays	your	slides	in	full-screen	mode.	This	is	the	view	you	use	when	you’re	actually giving	your	presentation.   Taking	the	Backstage	Tour  Every	summer,	I	attend	plays	at	the	Oregon	Shakespeare	Festival	in	Ashland,	Oregon. A	few	years	ago,	I	took	the	special	backstage	tour,	which	revealed	all	kinds	of	nifty secrets	worthy	of	a	Dan	Brown	novel. This	section	takes	a	brief	look	at	PowerPoint’s	Backstage	View	feature,	which	provides access	to	document	management	features	previously	found	on	the	File	menu.	When you	click	the	File	tab	in	the	top-left	corner	of	the	PowerPoint	window,	PowerPoint switches	to	Backstage	View,	as	shown	in	Figure	1-4.  Figure	1-4:	Backstage	View.  Initially,	Backstage	View	displays	information	about	the	current	presentation.	However, the	menu	on	the	left	—	which	bears	a	striking	resemblance	to	what	used	to	be	called the	File	menu	back	in	the	day	when	programs	had	plain	menus	instead	of	fancy	ribbons —	provides	access	to	the	hidden	features	of	PowerPoint	available	only	to	those	who venture	backstage. You	find	out	how	to	use	the	most	important	of	these	commands	later	in	this	chapter, and	several	of	the	more	advanced	commands	on	this	menu	are	presented	in	later chapters. Okay,	the	only	secret	I	learned	on	the	backstage	tour	at	Ashland	that	was	really	worthy of	a	Dan	Brown	novel	is	the	one	about	Psalm	46	in	the	King	James	translation	of	the Bible,	which	was	published	in	1611	—	when	William	Shakespeare	turned	46.	If	you count	46	words	from	the	start	of	the	Psalm,	you	get	the	word	Shake.	And	if	you	count 46	words	backwards	from	the	end	of	the	Psalm,	you	get	the	word	Spear.	Which	clearly means	that	there’s	a	treasure	buried	directly	beneath	the	stage	in	Ashland’s	outdoor theater.	Next	year	I’m	taking	a	shovel.   Creating	a	New	Presentation  The	simplest	way	to	create	a	new	presentation	is	to	start	PowerPoint,	click	Blank Presentation	on	the	opening	screen	 see	Figure	1-1 ,	and	then	edit	the	blank presentation	to	your	liking. After	PowerPoint	is	started,	you	can	also	create	a	new	presentation	by	clicking	the	File tab	to	switch	to	Backstage	View	and	then	clicking	the	New	command.	This	action brings	up	the	screen	shown	in	Figure	1-5,	which	offers	several	ways	to	create	a	new presentation:  Choose	Blank	Presentation:	Double-click	Blank	Presentation	to	start	a	new presentation	from	scratch. Choose	a	template:	You	can	select	one	of	the	displayed	templates	to	create	a	new presentation	based	on	the	template’s	design.	Several	templates	are	displayed	on	the New	screen. Search	for	a	template:	You	can	type	a	search	phrase	into	the	Search	text	box	and then	click	the	magnifying	glass	icon.	Doing	this	opens	a	list	of	templates	that	match your	search	criteria.	Double-click	one	of	these	templates	to	create	a	presentation based	on	it.  Figure	1-5:	Creating	a	new	presentation	on	the	New	screen	in	Backstage	View.  Editing	text In	PowerPoint,	slides	are	blank	areas	that	you	can	adorn	with	various	objects.	The	most common	type	of	object	is	a	text	placeholder,	a	rectangular	area	that’s	specially designated	for	holding	text.	 Other	types	of	objects	include	shapes,	such	as	circles	or triangles;	pictures	imported	from	clip	art	files;	and	graphs.  Most	slides	contain	two	text	objects:	one	for	the	slide’s	title	and	the	other	for	its	body   text.	However,	you	can	add	more	text	objects	if	you	want,	and	you	can	remove	the body	text	or	title	text	object.	You	can	even	remove	both	to	create	a	slide	that	contains no	text.  	Whenever	you	move	the	cursor	over	a	text	object,	the	cursor	changes	from	an  arrow	to	the	I-beam,	which	you	can	use	to	support	bridges	or	build	aircraft carriers.	Seriously,	when	the	cursor	changes	to	an	I-beam,	you	can	click	the	mouse button	and	start	typing	text.  When	you	click	a	text	object,	a	box	appears	around	the	text,	and	an	insertion	pointer appears	at	the	spot	where	you	clicked.	PowerPoint	then	becomes	like	a	word	processor. Any	characters	that	you	type	are	inserted	into	the	text	at	the	insertion	pointer	location. You	can	press	Delete	or	Backspace	to	demolish	text,	and	you	can	use	the	arrow	keys	to move	the	insertion	pointer	around	in	the	text	object.	If	you	press	Enter,	a	new	line	of text	begins	within	the	text	object. When	a	text	object	contains	no	text,	a	placeholder	message	appears	in	the	object.	For example,	a	title	text	object	displays	the	message	Click	to	add	title.	Other	placeholders display	similar	messages.	The	placeholder	message	magically	vanishes	when	you	click the	object	and	begin	typing	text.  	If	you	start	typing	without	clicking	anywhere,	the	text	that	you	type	is	entered into	the	title	text	object	—	assuming	that	the	title	text	object	doesn’t	already	have text	of	its	own.	If	the	title	object	is	not	empty,	any	text	that	you	type	 with	no	text object	selected 	is	simply	ignored.  After	you	finish	typing	text,	press	Esc	or	click	anywhere	outside	the	text	object. In	Chapter	2,	you	find	many	details	about	playing	with	text	objects,	but	hold	your horses.	You	have	more	important	things	to	attend	to	first. Adding	a	new	slide When	you	first	create	a	presentation,	it	has	just	one	slide,	which	is	useful	only	for	the shortest	presentations.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint	gives	you	about	50	ways	to	add	new slides	to	your	presentation.	You	see	only	three	of	them	here:  On	the	Home	tab,	click	the	New	Slide	button	in	the	Slides	group,	as	shown	in Figure	1-6. Press	Ctrl+M. Right-click	in	the	Slides	pane	on	the	left	and	then	choose	New	Slide.   Figure	1-6:	Choosing	a	slide	layout.  In	all	three	cases,	PowerPoint	adds	a	blank	slide	with	a	standard	layout	that	includes	a title	and	content	area,	as	shown	in	Figure	1-5.	If	you	want	to	choose	a	different	layout, click	the	Layout	button	in	the	Home	tab	to	display	the	gallery	of	slide	layouts.	This pane	enables	you	to	pick	from	several	types	of	slide	layouts.	Just	click	the	one	that	you want	to	use,	and	PowerPoint	sets	the	new	slide	to	the	layout	of	your	choosing. Each	slide	layout	has	a	name.	For	example,	the	Title	and	Content	layout	includes	a	text object	in	addition	to	the	title	area.	This	is	probably	the	layout	you’ll	use	most.	It’s	the best	format	for	presenting	a	topic	along	with	several	supporting	points.	For	example, Figure	1-7	shows	a	typical	bulleted	list	slide.  Figure	1-7:	A	typical	text	slide.  Moving	from	slide	to	slide You	have	several	ways	to	move	forward	and	backward	through	your	presentation,	from   slide	to	slide:  Click	one	of	the	double-headed	arrows	at	the	bottom	of	the	vertical	scroll	bar. Doing	so	moves	you	through	the	presentation	one	slide	at	a	time. Press	the	Page	Up	and	Page	Down	keys.	Using	these	keys	also	moves	one	slide	at a	time. Use	the	scroll	bar.	When	you	drag	the	box	in	the	scroll	bar,	a	tooltip	appears	to display	the	number	and	title	of	the	current	slide.	Dragging	the	scroll	bar	is	the quickest	way	to	move	directly	to	any	slide	in	your	presentation. In	the	list	of	slides	on	the	left	side	of	the	window,	click	the	thumbnail	for	the slide	that	you	want	to	display.	If	the	thumbnails	are	not	visible,	click	the	Slides tab	above	the	outline.  Choosing	a	design In	Parts	II	and	III	of	this	book,	you	discover	many	different	ways	to	create	great- looking	slides.	However,	you	don’t	have	to	wait	until	then	to	apply	some	basic	style	to your	presentation.	I’ve	already	mentioned	that	Office	2016	comes	preloaded	with	a handful	of	professionally	designed	themes	that	enable	you	to	create	polished presentations	with	just	the	click	of	a	mouse.	To	apply	one	of	these	themes,	just	select the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	theme	you	want	to	apply	in	the	Themes group.	Figure	1-8	shows	a	presentation	after	a	theme	has	been	applied.  Figure	1-8:	A	slide	after	a	theme	has	been	applied.  Because	of	space	constraints,	PowerPoint	doesn’t	display	all	the	available	themes	on the	Ribbon	at	the	same	time.	But	just	to	the	right	of	the	themes	is	a	scroll	bar	that	you can	use	to	scroll	through	the	themes.	And	the	button	at	the	bottom	of	the	scroll	bar brings	up	a	gallery	that	displays	all	the	themes	that	come	with	Office	2016.   Displaying	Your	Presentation  When	your	masterpiece	is	ready,	you	can	show	it	on	the	screen.	Just	follow	these	steps:  1.	  	Choose	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	From  Beginning	button	in	the	Start	Slide	Show	group	 shown	in	the	margin . There	are	several	shortcuts	to	this	command.	You	can	also	start	the	show	by pressing	F5	or	by	clicking	the	Slide	Show	button,	located	with	the	other	view buttons	in	the	lower-right	corner	of	the	screen.  2.	 Behold	the	first	slide.  The	slide	fills	the	screen.  3.	 Press	Enter	to	advance	to	the	next	slide.  You	can	keep	pressing	Enter	to	call	up	each	slide	in	the	presentation.	If	you	don’t like	the	Enter	key,	you	can	use	the	spacebar	instead. If	you	want	to	go	back	a	slide,	press	Page	Up.  4.	 Press	Esc	when	you’re	done.  You	don’t	have	to	wait	until	the	last	slide	is	shown.	If	you	find	a	glaring	mistake	in a	slide	or	if	you	just	get	bored,	you	can	press	Esc	at	any	time	to	return	to PowerPoint.  For	the	complete	lowdown	on	showing	your	presentation,	kindly	turn	to	Chapter	6.   Saving	Your	Work  Now	that	you’ve	spent	hours	creating	the	best	presentation	since	God	gave	Moses	the Ten	Commandments,	it’s	time	to	save	your	work	to	a	file.	If	you	make	the	rookie mistake	of	turning	off	your	computer	before	you’ve	saved	your	presentation,	poof! Your	work	vanishes	as	if	David	Copperfield	were	in	town. Like	everything	else	in	PowerPoint,	you	have	at	least	four	ways	to	save	a	document:  Click	the	Save	button	on	the	Quick	Access	toolbar. Click	the	File	tab	to	switch	to	Backstage	View	and	then	choose	Save. Press	Ctrl+S. Press	Shift+F12.  If	you	haven’t	yet	saved	the	file	to	your	hard	drive,	the	magical	Save	As	dialog	box appears.	Type	the	name	that	you	want	to	use	for	the	file	in	the	Save	As	dialog	box	and click	OK	to	save	the	file.	After	you	save	the	file	once,	subsequent	saves	update	the	hard drive	file	with	any	changes	that	you	made	to	the	presentation	since	the	last	time	you saved	it. Also	note	that	after	you	save	a	file	for	the	first	time,	the	name	in	the	presentation window’s	title	area	changes	from	Presentation	to	the	name	of	your	file.	This	is	simply proof	that	the	file	has	been	saved.  	Keep	the	following	tips	in	mind	when	saving	files:  Put	on	your	Thinking	Cap	when	assigning	a	name	to	a	new	file.	The	filename	is how	you	can	recognize	the	file	later	on,	so	pick	a	meaningful	name	that	suggests the	file’s	contents. Don’t	work	on	your	file	for	hours	at	a	time	without	saving	it.	I’ve	learned	the	hard way	to	save	my	work	every	few	minutes.	You	never	know	when	the	power	might go	out	or	your	computer	might	unexpectedly	self-destruct.	Get	into	the	habit	of saving	every	few	minutes,	especially	after	making	a	significant	change	to	a presentation,	such	as	adding	a	covey	of	new	slides	or	making	a	gaggle	of complicated	formatting	changes. If	you	want	to	save	a	copy	of	the	presentation	you’re	working	on	using	a	different filename,	choose	File ⇒ Save	As.	Type	a	new	name	for	the	file	and	then	click	Save. The	File ⇒ Save	As	command	includes	a	Save	As	Type	option	that	lets	you	change the	file	format	your	presentation	file	is	saved	in.	The	most	important	use	of	this option	is	to	save	your	file	as	a	PDF	or	XPS	file.	A	PDF	file	is	a	widely	used	file format	that	lets	any	user	display	the	contents	of	the	file	whether	or	not	he	or	she owns	a	copy	of	the	software	used	to	create	the	file.	PDF	was	developed	and   marketed	by	Adobe.	XPS	has	a	similar	purpose,	but	was	developed	and	marketed by	Microsoft. One	of	the	best	features	of	Office	2016	is	OneDrive,	which	provides	an	online location	for	you	to	save	your	files.	When	you	save	a	file	to	your	OneDrive	account, you	can	later	retrieve	it	from	any	other	computer	that	has	an	Internet	connection.	To save	to	OneDrive,	just	click	OneDrive	in	the	Save	As	dialog	box,	type	a	name	for your	file,	and	click	Save.   Opening	a	Presentation  After	you	save	your	presentation	to	your	hard	drive,	you	can	retrieve	it	later	when	you want	to	make	additional	changes	or	to	print	it.	As	you	might	guess,	PowerPoint	gives you	about	2,037	ways	to	accomplish	the	retrieval.	Here	are	the	two	of	the	most common:  Click	the	File	tab	to	switch	to	Backstage	View	and	then	choose	the	Open	command. Press	Ctrl+O.  Both	options	take	you	to	the	Open	screen	in	Backstage	View,	as	shown	in	Figure	1-9. From	here,	you	can	select	a	file	from	a	list	of	recently	opened	presentations.	Or,	you can	open	a	file	that	you	have	saved	to	your	OneDrive	account.  Figure	1-9:	Opening	a	file	in	Backstage	View.  To	browse	your	computer	for	a	file,	double-click	Computer.	This	brings	up	a	standard Open	dialog	box,	as	shown	in	Figure	1-10.	The	Open	dialog	box	has	controls	that enable	you	to	rummage	through	the	various	folders	on	your	hard	drive	in	search	of your	files.	If	you	know	how	to	open	a	file	in	any	Windows	application,	you	know	how to	do	it	in	PowerPoint	 because	the	Open	dialog	box	is	pretty	much	the	same	in	any Windows	program .   Figure	1-10:	The	Open	dialog	box.  If	you	seem	to	have	lost	a	file,	rummage	around	in	different	folders	to	see	whether	you can	find	it.	Perhaps	you	saved	a	file	in	the	wrong	folder	by	accident.	Also,	check	the spelling	of	the	filename.	Maybe	your	fingers	weren’t	on	the	home	row	when	you	typed the	filename,	so	instead	of	Shakespeare1.pptx,	you	saved	the	file	as	Djslrd[rstr2.pptx.	I hate	it	when	that	happens.  	The	fastest	way	to	open	a	file	from	the	Open	dialog	box	is	to	double-click	the  file.	This	spares	you	from	having	to	click	the	file	once	and	then	click	OK.	Double- clicking	also	exercises	the	fast-twitch	muscles	in	your	index	finger.  PowerPoint	keeps	track	of	the	files	you’ve	recently	opened	and	displays	them	on	the File	menu.	To	open	a	file	that	you	recently	opened,	click	the	File	tab,	select	Recent	in Backstage	View,	and	then	inspect	the	list	of	files	on	the	right	side	of	the	menu.	If	the file	that	you	want	is	in	the	list,	click	it	to	open	it.   Closing	a	Presentation  Having	finished	and	saved	your	presentation,	you	have	come	to	the	time	to	close	it. Closing	a	presentation	is	kind	of	like	gathering	your	papers,	putting	them	neatly	in	a file	folder,	and	returning	the	folder	to	its	proper	file	drawer.	The	presentation disappears	from	your	computer	screen.	Don’t	worry:	It’s	tucked	safely	away	on	your hard	drive	where	you	can	get	to	it	later	if	you	need	to. To	close	a	file,	click	the	Close	button	that	appears	at	the	top	right	of	the	PowerPoint window.	Alternatively,	you	can	click	the	File	tab	and	then	choose	Close,	or	use	the keyboard	shortcut	Ctrl+W.	But	clicking	the	Close	button	is	the	easiest	way	to	close	a file.  	You	don’t	have	to	close	a	file	before	exiting	PowerPoint.	If	you	exit  PowerPoint	without	closing	a	file,	PowerPoint	graciously	closes	the	file	for	you. The	only	reason	that	you	might	want	to	close	a	file	is	that	you	want	to	work	on	a different	file	and	you	don’t	want	to	keep	both	files	open	at	the	same	time.  If	you’ve	made	changes	since	the	last	time	you	saved	the	file,	PowerPoint	offers	to save	the	changes	for	you.	Click	Save	to	save	the	file	before	closing	or	click	Don’t	Save to	abandon	any	changes	that	you’ve	made	to	the	file. If	you	close	all	the	open	PowerPoint	presentations,	you	might	discover	that	most	of	the PowerPoint	commands	have	been	rendered	useless.	 They	are	grayed	on	the	menu.  Fear	not.	If	you	open	a	presentation	or	create	a	new	one,	the	commands	return	to	life.   Getting	Help  The	ideal	way	to	use	PowerPoint	would	be	to	have	a	PowerPoint	expert	sitting patiently	at	your	side,	answering	your	every	question	with	a	straightforward	answer, gently	correcting	you	when	you	make	silly	mistakes,	and	otherwise	minding	his	or	her own	business.	All	you’d	have	to	do	is	occasionally	toss	the	expert	a	Twinkie	and	let him	or	her	outside	once	a	day. Short	of	that,	the	next	best	thing	is	to	find	out	how	to	coax	PowerPoint	itself	into	giving you	the	answers	you	need.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint	includes	a	nice	built-in	Help feature	that	can	answer	your	questions.	No	matter	how	deeply	you’re	lost	in	the PowerPoint	jungle,	help	is	never	more	than	a	few	mouse	clicks	or	keystrokes	away. As	with	everything	else	in	Office,	more	than	one	method	is	available	for	calling	up help	when	you	need	it.	The	easiest	thing	to	do	would	be	to	yell,	“Skipper!!!”	in	your best	Gilligan	voice.	Otherwise,	you	have	the	following	options:  Press	F1	or	click	the	Help	button,	located	just	above	the	right	edge	of	the	Ribbon. This	activates	PowerPoint’s	main	Help	system,	shown	in	Figure	1-11. Whenever	a	dialog	box	is	displayed,	you	can	click	the	question	mark	button	in	the top-right	corner	of	the	dialog	box	to	summon	help. When	you	hover	the	mouse	over	an	item	in	the	Ribbon,	a	tooltip	appears	explaining what	the	item	does.	Many	of	these	tooltips	include	the	phrase	“Press	F1	for	more help.”	In	that	case,	you	can	press	F1	to	get	help	specific	to	that	item.   Figure	1-11:	Help!  The	Help	dialog	box	in	Figure	1-11	offers	several	ways	to	access	the	help	you	need. The	following	paragraphs	describe	the	various	ways	you	can	work	your	way	through PowerPoint’s	Help	feature:  Help	window	links:	You	can	click	any	of	the	links	that	appear	in	the	Help	window to	display	help	on	a	particular	topic.	For	example,	if	you	click	the	Working	with Charts	link,	you’ll	find	a	page	of	useful	information	about	creating	charts. Search:	If	you	can’t	find	what	you’re	looking	for,	try	entering	a	word	or	phrase	in the	Search	box	and	clicking	the	Search	button.	This	displays	a	list	of	topics	that pertain	to	the	word	or	phrase	you	entered.  	Pushpin	icon:	Normally,	the	Help	window	always	displays	on	top.	In many	cases,	this	obscures	your	access	to	the	PowerPoint	window.	If	you	don’t	want the	Help	window	to	always	stay	on	top,	you	can	click	the	button	with	the	pushpin icon.	Then	the	Help	window	will	minimize	like	any	other	window.   	Back	button:	You	can	retrace	your	steps	by	clicking	the	Help  window’s	Back	button.	You	can	use	the	Back	button	over	and	over	again,	retracing all	your	steps	if	necessary.  	Home	button:	Takes	you	back	to	the	Help	home	page.   Exiting	PowerPoint  Had	enough	excitement	for	one	day?	Use	either	of	these	techniques	to	shut	down PowerPoint:  Click	the	X	box	at	the	top-right	corner	of	the	PowerPoint	window. Press	Alt+F4.  Bam!	PowerPoint	is	history. You	should	know	a	couple	things	about	exiting	PowerPoint	 or	any	application :  PowerPoint	doesn’t	let	you	abandon	ship	without	first	considering	whether	you want	to	save	your	work.	If	you’ve	made	changes	to	any	presentation	files	and haven’t	saved	them,	PowerPoint	offers	to	save	the	files	for	you.	Lean	over	and plant	a	fat	kiss	right	in	the	middle	of	your	monitor	—	PowerPoint	just	saved	you your	job.  	Never,	never,	never,	ever,	never	turn	off	your	computer	while	PowerPoint  or	any	other	program	is	running.	Bad!	Always	exit	PowerPoint	and	all	other programs	that	are	running	before	you	turn	off	your	computer.   Chapter	2   Editing	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Moving	around	in	a	presentation 	Working	with	objects	and	editing	text 	Undoing	a	mistake	and	deleting	slides 	Finding	and	replacing	text 	Rearranging	slides  If	you’re	like	Mary	Poppins	 “Practically	Perfect	in	Every	Way” ,	you	can	skip	this chapter.	Perfect	people	never	make	mistakes,	so	everything	that	they	type	in PowerPoint	comes	out	right	the	first	time.	They	never	have	to	press	Backspace	to	erase something	they	typed	incorrectly,	or	go	back	and	insert	a	line	to	make	a	point	they	left out,	or	rearrange	their	slides	because	they	didn’t	add	them	in	the	right	order	to	begin with. If	you’re	more	like	Jane	 “Rather	Inclined	to	Giggle;	Doesn’t	Put	Things	Away” 	or Michael	 “Extremely	Stubborn	and	Suspicious” ,	you	probably	make	mistakes	along the	way.	This	chapter	shows	you	how	to	go	back	and	correct	those	mistakes. Reviewing	your	work	and	correcting	it	if	necessary	is	called	editing.	It’s	not	a	fun	job, but	it	has	to	be	done.	A	spoonful	of	sugar	usually	helps.  This	chapter	focuses	mostly	on	editing	text	objects.	Many	of	the	techniques	also	apply to	editing	other	types	of	objects,	such	as	clip	art	pictures	or	drawn	shapes.	For	more information	about	editing	other	types	of	objects,	see	Part	III.   Moving	from	Slide	to	Slide  On	a	computer	with	a	keyboard,	the	easiest	way	to	move	in	a	PowerPoint	presentation is	to	press	the	Page	Down	and	Page	Up	keys:  Page	Down:	Press	Page	Down	to	move	forward	to	the	next	slide	in	your presentation. Page	Up:	Press	Page	Up	to	move	backward	to	the	preceding	slide	in	your presentation.  You	can	also	use	the	vertical	scroll	bar	on	the	right	side	of	the	window	to	navigate through	your	presentation:  Double-headed	arrows:	You	can	move	forward	or	backward	through	your presentation	one	slide	at	a	time	by	clicking	the	double-headed	arrows	at	the	bottom of	the	vertical	scroll	bar. Single-headed	arrows:	You	can	also	scroll	forward	or	backward	through	your presentation	by	clicking	and	holding	the	single-headed	arrow	at	the	top	or	bottom of	the	vertical	scroll	bar.	 Note	that	if	the	zoom	factor	is	set	so	that	a	single	slide	is visible	in	the	presentation	window,	clicking	the	single-headed	arrows	moves	to	the next	or	preceding	slide.  Scroll	box:	Another	way	to	move	quickly	from	slide	to	slide	is	by	dragging	the scroll	bar	up	or	down.	When	you	drag	the	scroll	bar,	a	little	tooltip	pops	up	next	to it	to	tell	you	which	slide	will	be	displayed	if	you	stop	dragging	at	that	point.  If	you	have	a	touchscreen,	you	can	use	a	flick	of	your	finger	to	move	from	slide	to slide.   Working	with	Objects  In	the	beginning,	the	User	created	a	slide.	And	the	slide	was	formless	and	void, without	meaning	or	content.	And	the	User	said,	“Let	there	be	a	Text	Object.”	And there	was	a	Text	Object.	And	there	was	evening	and	there	was	morning,	one	day. Then	the	User	said,	“Let	there	be	a	Picture	Object.”	And	there	was	a	Picture Object.	And	there	was	evening	and	there	was	morning,	a	second	day.	This continued	for	forty	days	and	forty	nights,	until	there	were	forty	objects	on	the slide,	each	after	its	own	kind.	And	the	User	was	laughed	out	of	the	auditorium	by the	audience	who	could	not	read	the	slide.  I	present	this	charming	little	parable	solely	to	make	the	point	that	PowerPoint	slides	are nothing	without	objects.	Objects	are	items	—	such	as	text,	pictures,	and	charts	—	that give	meaning	and	content	to	otherwise	formless	and	empty	slides.	When	it	comes	to objects,	however,	sometimes	less	is	more.	Don’t	overdo	it	by	cluttering	your	slides	with so	many	objects	that	the	main	point	of	the	slide	is	obscured. Most	of	the	objects	on	your	slides	are	text	objects,	which	let	you	type	text	on	your slides.	For	more	information	about	working	with	text	objects,	see	Chapter	7. Every	slide	has	a	slide	layout	that	consists	of	one	or	more	placeholders.	A	placeholder is	simply	an	area	on	a	slide	that’s	reserved	for	text,	clip	art,	a	graph,	or	some	other	type of	object.	For	example,	a	slide	that	uses	the	Title	layout	has	two	placeholders	for	text objects:	one	for	the	title	and	the	other	for	the	subtitle.	You	use	the	Slide	Layout	task pane	to	select	the	layout	when	you	create	new	slides.	You	can	change	the	layout	later, as	well	as	add	more	objects	to	the	slide.	You	can	also	delete,	move,	or	resize	objects	if you	want.	For	more	information	about	slide	layouts,	see	Chapter	1. You	can	add	many	different	types	of	objects,	such	as	clip	art,	charts,	graphs,	shapes, and	so	on.	You	can	add	more	objects	to	your	slide	with	one	of	the	tools	that	appears	on the	Drawing	toolbar	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen	or	by	using	the	icons	that	appear	in	the center	of	slides	created	using	the	Content	layouts.	For	more	information	about	adding objects	to	your	slides,	see	Chapters	11	through	16. Each	object	occupies	a	rectangular	region	on	the	slide.	The	contents	of	the	object	may or	may	not	visually	fill	the	rectangular	region,	but	you	can	see	the	outline	of	the	object when	you	select	it.	 See	the	next	section,	“Selecting	objects.”  Objects	can	overlap.	Usually,	you	don’t	want	them	to,	but	sometimes	doing	so	creates	a jazzy	effect.	You	may	lay	some	text	on	top	of	some	clip	art,	for	example. Selecting	objects Before	you	can	edit	anything	on	a	slide,	you	have	to	select	the	object	that	contains whatever	it	is	that	you	want	to	edit.	For	example,	you	can’t	start	typing	away	to	edit text	onscreen.	Instead,	you	must	first	select	the	text	object	that	contains	the	text	you want	to	edit.	Likewise,	you	must	select	other	types	of	objects	before	you	can	edit	their   contents. Note	that	you	must	be	in	Normal	view	to	select	individual	objects	on	the	slide.	In	Slide Sorter	view,	you	can	select	whole	slides	but	not	the	individual	elements	on	them. Here	are	some	guidelines	to	keep	in	mind	when	selecting	objects:  Text	objects:	To	select	a	text	object	so	that	you	can	edit	its	text,	move	the	insertion point	over	the	text	that	you	want	to	edit	and	then	click.	 On	a	touchpad,	double-tap the	text. 	A	rectangular	box	appears	around	the	object,	and	a	text	insertion	point appears	so	that	you	can	start	typing	away. Non-text	objects:	Other	types	of	objects	work	a	little	differently.	Click	an	object, and	the	object	is	selected.	The	rectangular	box	appears	around	the	object	to	let	you know	that	you’ve	hooked	it.	After	you’ve	hooked	the	object,	you	can	drag	it	around the	screen	or	change	its	size,	but	you	can’t	edit	its	contents. The	Ctrl	key:	You	can	select	more	than	one	object	by	selecting	the	first	object	and then	holding	down	the	Ctrl	key	while	clicking	to	select	additional	objects. Click	and	drag:	Another	way	to	select	an	object	—	or	more	than	one	object	—	is to	use	the	insertion	point	to	drag	a	rectangle	around	the	objects	that	you	want	to select.	Point	to	a	location	above	and	to	the	left	of	the	object s 	that	you	want	to select,	and	then	click	and	drag	the	mouse	down	and	to	the	right	until	the	rectangle surrounds	the	objects.	When	you	release	the	button,	all	the	objects	within	the rectangle	are	selected. The	Tab	key:	Also,	you	can	press	the	Tab	key	to	select	objects.	Press	Tab	once	to select	the	first	object	on	the	slide.	Press	Tab	again	to	select	the	next	object.	Keep pressing	Tab	until	the	object	that	you	want	is	selected. Pressing	Tab	to	select	objects	is	handy	when	you	can’t	easily	point	to	the	object	that you	want	to	select.	This	problem	can	happen	if	the	object	that	you	want	is	buried underneath	another	object	or	if	the	object	is	empty	or	otherwise	invisible	and you’re	not	sure	of	its	location.  Resizing	or	moving	an	object When	you	select	an	object,	an	outline	box	appears	around	it,	as	shown	in	Figure	2-1.	If you	look	closely	at	the	box,	you	can	see	that	it	has	love	handles,	one	on	each	corner and	one	in	the	middle	of	each	edge.	You	can	use	these	love	handles	to	adjust	the	size	of an	object.	You	can	also	grab	the	box	edge	between	the	love	handles	to	move	the	object on	the	slide.	 Technically,	the	love	handles	are	called	sizing	handles.    Figure	2-1:	You	can	resize	this	object	by	taking	hold	of	its	love	handles.  In	addition,	for	many	types	of	objects,	a	circular	arrow	called	the	rotate	handle	appears, floating	above	the	object.	You	can	rotate	the	object	by	grabbing	this	handle	and dragging	it	around	in	a	circle.	 Not	all	types	of	objects	can	be	rotated,	however.	For example,	you	can’t	rotate	charts.  To	change	the	size	of	an	object,	click	the	object	to	select	it	and	then	grab	one	of	the love	handles	by	clicking.	Hold	down	the	mouse	button	and	then	move	the	mouse	to change	the	object’s	size. The	various	handles	on	an	object	give	you	different	ways	to	change	the	object’s	size:  The	handles	at	the	corners	enable	you	to	change	both	the	height	and	the	width	of the	object. The	handles	on	the	top	and	bottom	edges	enable	you	to	change	just	the	object’s height. The	handles	on	the	right	and	left	edges	change	just	the	width	of	the	object.  If	you	hold	down	the	Ctrl	key	while	you	drag	one	of	the	love	handles,	the	object	stays centered	at	its	current	position	on	the	slide	as	its	size	adjusts.	Try	it	to	see	what	I	mean. Also,	try	holding	down	the	Shift	key	while	you	drag	an	object	by	using	one	of	the corner	love	handles.	This	combination	maintains	the	object’s	proportions	when	you resize	it. Changing	a	text	object’s	size	doesn’t	change	the	size	of	the	text	in	the	object;	it	changes only	the	size	of	the	frame	that	contains	the	text.	Changing	the	width	of	a	text	object	is equivalent	to	changing	margins	in	a	word	processor:	It	makes	the	text	lines	wider	or narrower.	To	change	the	size	of	the	text	within	a	text	object,	you	must	change	the	font size.	For	more	information,	see	Chapter	7.   To	move	an	object,	click	anywhere	on	the	outline	box	—	except	on	a	love	handle	— and	then	drag	the	object	to	its	new	locale.	Note	that	for	shapes	and	other	graphic objects,	you	don’t	have	to	click	precisely	on	the	outline	box	—	you	can	click	and	drag anywhere	within	the	object	to	move	it.	But	for	objects	that	contain	text,	you	must	click the	outline	box	itself	to	drag	the	object	to	a	new	location.  	The	outline	box	can	be	hard	to	see	if	you	have	a	fancy	background	on	your  slides.	If	you	select	an	object	and	have	trouble	seeing	the	outline	box,	try squinting	or	cleaning	your	monitor	screen.	Or,	in	severe	weather,	try	selecting	the View	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	choosing	one	of	the	Color Grayscale	options:  Color:	Displays	slides	in	full	color Grayscale:	Displays	colors	as	shades	of	gray Pure	Black	and	White:	Shows	the	slides	in	black	and	white  Viewing	the	slide	in	Grayscale	or	Pure	Black	and	White	might	make	the	love	handles easier	to	spot.	To	switch	back	to	full-color	view,	click	Back	to	Color	View.   Editing	a	Text	Object  When	you	select	a	text	object	for	editing,	PowerPoint	transforms	into	a	baby	word processor	so	you	can	edit	the	text.	Note	that	PowerPoint	automatically	wraps	text	so that	you	don’t	have	to	press	Enter	at	the	end	of	every	line.	Press	Enter	only	when	you want	to	begin	a	new	paragraph. Text	in	a	PowerPoint	presentation	is	usually	formatted	with	a	bullet	character	at	the beginning	of	each	paragraph.	The	default	bullet	character	depends	on	the	theme	you’ve applied	to	the	slide.	But	if	you	don’t	like	the	bullet	provided	by	the	theme,	you	can change	it	to	just	about	any	shape	that	you	can	imagine.	The	point	to	remember	here	is that	the	bullet	character	is	a	part	of	the	paragraph	format,	and	not	a	character	that	you have	to	type	in	your	text. You	can	move	around	within	a	text	object	by	pressing	the	arrow	keys	or	by	using	the mouse.	You	can	also	use	the	End	and	Home	keys	to	take	the	insertion	point	to	the	start or	end	of	the	line	that	you’re	on.	Additionally,	you	can	use	the	arrow	keys	in combination	with	the	Ctrl	key	to	move	around	even	faster.	For	example,	press	the	Ctrl key	and	the	left-	or	right-arrow	key	to	move	left	or	right	an	entire	word	at	a	time. You	delete	text	by	pressing	the	Delete	or	Backspace	key.	To	delete	from	the	insertion point	to	the	start	or	end	of	a	word,	use	the	Ctrl	key	along	with	the	Delete	or	Backspace key.	If	you	first	select	a	block	of	text,	the	Delete	and	Backspace	keys	delete	the	entire selection.	 The	next	section,	“Selecting	Text,”	has	some	tips	for	selecting	text.    Selecting	Text  Some	text-editing	operations	—	such	as	amputations	and	transplants	—	require	that you	first	select	the	text	on	which	you	want	to	operate.	The	following	list	shows	you	the methods	for	selecting	blocks	of	text:  When	you	use	the	keyboard,	hold	down	the	Shift	key	while	you	press	any	of	the arrow	keys	to	move	the	insertion	point. When	you	use	the	mouse,	point	to	the	beginning	of	the	text	that	you	want	to	mark and	then	click	and	drag	over	the	text.	Release	the	mouse	button	when	you	reach	the end	of	the	text	that	you	want	to	select.  PowerPoint	has	an	automatic	word-selection	option	that	tries	to	guess	when	you	intend to	select	an	entire	word.	If	you	use	the	mouse	to	select	a	block	of	text	that	spans	the space	between	two	words,	you	notice	that	the	selected	text	jumps	to	include	entire words	while	you	move	the	mouse.	If	you	don’t	like	this	feature,	you	can	disable	it	by clicking	the	File	tab	and	Options	button	in	Backstage	View.	Then	deselect	the	When Selecting,	Automatically	Select	Entire	Word	check	box. You	can	use	the	following	tricks	to	select	different	amounts	of	text:  A	single	word:	To	select	a	single	word,	point	the	insertion	point	anywhere	in	the word	and	double-click. An	entire	paragraph:	To	select	an	entire	paragraph,	point	the	insertion	point anywhere	in	the	paragraph	and	triple-click.	 Although	this	works	with	a	mouse,	you can’t	select	an	entire	paragraph	by	triple-tapping	on	a	touchscreen.   After	you	have	selected	text,	you	can	edit	it	in	the	following	ways:  Delete	text:	To	delete	the	entire	block	of	text	that	you’ve	selected,	press	Delete	or Backspace. Replace	text:	To	replace	an	entire	block	of	text,	select	it	and	then	begin	typing.	The selected	block	vanishes	and	is	replaced	by	the	text	that	you’re	typing. Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste:	You	can	use	the	Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste	commands	from	the Clipboard	group	with	selected	text	blocks.	The	following	section	describes	these commands.   Using	Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste  Like	any	good	Windows	program,	PowerPoint	uses	the	standard	Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste commands.	These	commands	work	on	text	that	you’ve	selected,	or	if	you’ve	selected an	entire	object,	the	commands	work	on	the	object	itself.	In	other	words,	you	can	use the	Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste	commands	with	bits	of	text	or	with	entire	objects. Cut,	Copy,	and	Paste	all	work	with	one	of	the	greatest	mysteries	of	Windows	—	the Clipboard.	The	Clipboard	is	where	Windows	stashes	stuff	so	that	you	can	get	to	it	later. The	Cut	and	Copy	commands	add	stuff	to	the	Clipboard,	and	the	Paste	command copies	stuff	from	the	Clipboard	to	your	presentation. For	basic	cutting,	copying,	and	pasting,	you	can	use	the	standard	Windows	keyboard shortcuts:	Ctrl+X	for	Cut,	Ctrl+C	for	Copy,	and	Ctrl+V	for	Paste.	Because	these	three keyboard	shortcuts	work	in	virtually	all	Windows	programs,	memorizing	them	pays off. The	Ribbon	buttons	for	working	with	the	Clipboard	are	found	in	the	Clipboard	group of	the	Home	tab.	Three	of	the	four	buttons	in	this	section	are	for	working	with	the Clipboard:  Cut  Copy  Paste  Notice	that	the	Copy	button	includes	a	drop-down	arrow.	If	you	click	the	Copy	icon itself,	the	selected	object	is	copied	to	the	Clipboard.	But	if	you	click	the	drop-down arrow	instead,	a	small	menu	with	two	icons	is	displayed.	The	first	copies	the	selection; the	second	makes	a	duplicate.	For	more	information	about	creating	duplicates,	see	the next	section,	“Duplicating	an	Object.” Here’s	a	cool	feature:	PowerPoint	2016	lets	you	preview	how	the	contents	of	the Clipboard	will	appear	before	you	actually	paste	it	into	your	slide.	To	use	this	feature, copy	or	cut	something	to	the	Clipboard.	Then,	click	the	down	arrow	beneath	the	Paste button.	This	reveals	a	menu	with	several	buttons	representing	different	ways	to	paste the	selection.	Hover	the	mouse	over	each	icon	to	see	a	preview	of	how	the	item	will appear	when	pasted.	When	you	find	a	button	whose	paste	preview	you	approve	of, click	the	button	to	paste	the	item. If	you	want	to	blow	away	an	entire	object	permanently,	select	it	and	then	press	Delete or	Backspace.	This	step	removes	the	object	from	the	slide	but	doesn’t	copy	it	to	the Clipboard.	It’s	gone	forever.	Well,	sort	of	—	you	can	still	get	it	back	by	using	the	Undo command,	but	only	if	you	act	fast.	See	the	section	“Oops!	I	Didn’t	Mean	It	 The   Marvelous	Undo	Command ”	for	more	information.  	To	include	the	same	object	on	each	of	your	slides,	you	can	use	a	better	method  than	copying	and	pasting:	Add	the	object	to	the	Slide	Master,	which	governs	the format	of	all	the	slides	in	a	presentation.	 See	Chapter	10.    Duplicating	an	Object  PowerPoint	has	a	Duplicate	command	you	can	use	to	quickly	create	copies	of	objects. First,	select	the	object	you	want	to	duplicate.	Then,	press	Ctrl+D	to	create	a	duplicate of	the	object.	You	probably	need	to	move	the	duplicate	object	to	its	correct	location. An	even	easier	way	to	duplicate	an	object	is	to	select	the	object,	hold	down	the	Ctrl key,	then	press	and	hold	the	left	mouse	button	and	drag	the	object	to	a	new	location	on the	slide.	After	you	release	the	mouse	button,	a	duplicate	copy	of	the	object	is	created.   Using	the	Clipboard	Task	Pane  The	Clipboard	task	pane	lets	you	gather	up	to	24	items	of	text	or	graphics	from	any Office	program	and	then	selectively	paste	them	into	your	presentation.	To	summon	the Clipboard	task	pane,	click	the	dialog	box	launcher	in	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon	at the	bottom	right	of	the	Clipboard	group.	Then,	the	Clipboard	task	pane	appears,	as shown	in	Figure	2-2.	Here	you	can	see	the	Clipboard	task	pane	at	the	left	side	of	the PowerPoint	window,	with	several	objects	held	in	the	Clipboard.  Figure	2-2:	The	Clipboard	task	pane.  To	paste	an	item	from	the	Clipboard	task	pane,	simply	click	the	item	you	want	to	insert.   Oops!	I	Didn’t	Mean	It	 The	Marvelous Undo	Command   Made	a	mistake?	Don’t	panic.	Use	the	Undo	command.	Undo	is	your	safety	net.	If	you mess	up,	Undo	can	save	the	day. You	have	two	ways	to	undo	a	mistake:  Click	the	Undo	button	in	the	Quick	Access	toolbar. Press	Ctrl+Z.  Undo	reverses	whatever	you	did	last.	If	you	deleted	text,	Undo	adds	it	back.	If	you typed	text,	Undo	deletes	it.	If	you	moved	an	object,	Undo	puts	it	back	where	it	was. You	get	the	idea. Undo	is	such	a	useful	command	that	committing	the	Ctrl+Z	keyboard	shortcut	to memory	is	a	good	idea.	If	you	want,	think	of	the	word	Zip!	to	help	you	remember	how to	zip	away	your	mistakes.  	Undo	remembers	up	to	20	of	your	most	recent	actions.	You	can	undo	each	action  one	at	a	time	by	repeatedly	using	the	Undo	command.	Or	you	can	click	the	down	arrow next	to	the	Undo	button	 shown	in	the	margin 	on	the	Quick	Access	toolbar	and	then choose	the	actions	you	want	to	undo	from	the	list	that	appears.	However,	as	a	general rule,	you	should	correct	your	mistakes	as	soon	as	possible.	If	you	make	a	mistake,	feel free	to	curse,	kick	something,	or	fall	on	the	floor	in	a	screaming	tantrum	if	you	must, but	don’t	do	anything	else	on	your	computer!	If	you	use	the	Undo	command immediately,	you	can	reverse	your	mistake	and	get	on	with	your	life.  	PowerPoint	also	offers	a	Redo	command	 shown	in	the	margin ,	which	is	sort	of  like	an	Undo	for	Undo.	In	other	words,	if	you	undo	what	you	thought	was	a	mistake	by using	the	Undo	command	and	then	decide	that	it	wasn’t	a	mistake	after	all,	you	can	use the	Redo	command.	Here	are	two	ways	to	use	the	Redo	command:  Click	the	Redo	button	on	the	Quick	Access	toolbar. Press	Ctrl+Y.  Note	that	if	the	last	action	you	performed	wasn’t	an	Undo	command,	the	Redo	button	is replaced	by	a	Repeat	button.	You	can	click	the	Repeat	button	to	repeat	the	last command.   Deleting	a	Slide  Want	to	delete	an	entire	slide?	No	problem.	Simply	move	to	the	slide	that	you	want	to delete	and	click	the	Delete	button	in	the	Slides	group	of	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon. Zowie!	The	slide	is	history. Another	way	to	delete	a	slide	is	to	click	the	miniature	of	the	slide	in	the	Slide	Preview pane	 on	the	left	side	of	the	screen 	and	then	press	the	Delete	key	or	the	Backspace	key. Deleted	the	wrong	slide,	eh?	No	problem.	Just	press	Ctrl+Z	or	click	the	Undo	button	to restore	the	slide.   Duplicating	a	Slide  PowerPoint	sports	a	Duplicate	Slide	command	that	lets	you	duplicate	an	entire	slide	— text,	formatting,	and	everything	else	included.	That	way,	after	you	toil	over	a	slide	for hours	to	get	its	formatting	just	right,	you	can	create	a	duplicate	to	use	as	the	basis	for another	slide. To	duplicate	a	slide	—	or	slides	—	select	the	slide s 	you	want	to	duplicate.	Then	open the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	arrow	at	the	bottom	of	the	Add	Slide	button	in the	Slides	group,	and	click	the	Duplicate	Selected	Slides	button.	A	duplicate	of	the slide	is	inserted	into	your	presentation. If	you’re	a	keyboard	shortcut	fanatic,	all	you	have	to	do	is	select	the	slide	that	you	want to	duplicate	in	the	Slides	pane	 located	on	the	left	side	of	the	screen 	and	then	press Ctrl+D.   Finding	Text  You	know	that	buried	somewhere	in	that	60-slide	presentation	about	Configurable Snarfblats	is	a	slide	that	lists	the	options	available	on	the	Vertical	Snarfblat,	but	where is	it?	This	sounds	like	a	job	for	the	PowerPoint	Find	command! The	Find	command	can	find	text	buried	in	any	text	object	on	any	slide.	These	steps show	you	the	procedure	for	using	the	Find	command:  1.	 Think	of	what	you	want	to	find.  Snarfblat	will	suffice	for	this	example.  2.	  	Click	the	Find	button	in	the	Editing	group	of	the	Home	tab	 as	shown	in  the	margin 	or	use	the	keyboard	shortcut	Ctrl+F. The	Find	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	2-3,	which	contains	the	secrets	of the	Find	command.  3.	 Type	the	text	that	you	want	to	find.  It	displays	in	the	Find	What	box.  4.	 Press	Enter. 5.	 Or	click	the	Find	Next	button.	Either	way,	the	search	begins.  Figure	2-3:	The	Find	dialog	box.  If	the	text	that	you	type	is	located	anywhere	in	the	presentation,	the	Find	command	zips you	to	the	slide	that	contains	the	text	and	highlights	the	text.	You	can	then	edit	the	text object	or	search	for	the	next	occurrence	of	the	text	within	your	presentation.	If	you	edit the	text,	the	Find	dialog	box	stays	onscreen	to	make	it	easy	to	continue	your	quest. Here	are	some	facts	to	keep	in	mind	when	using	the	Find	command:  Find	the	next	occurrence:	To	find	the	next	occurrence	of	the	same	text,	press Enter	or	click	the	Find	Next	button	again. Edit	the	text:	To	edit	the	text	you	found,	click	the	text	object.	The	Find	dialog	box remains	onscreen.	To	continue	searching,	click	the	Find	Next	button	again. Start	anywhere:	You	don’t	have	to	be	at	the	beginning	of	your	presentation	to search	the	entire	presentation.	When	PowerPoint	reaches	the	end	of	the presentation,	it	automatically	picks	up	the	search	at	the	beginning	and	continues	to the	point	at	which	you	started	the	search.   Give	up:	You	might	receive	the	following	message:  PowerPoint	has	finished	searching	the	presentation.	The	search	item	wasn’t	found.  This	message	means	that	PowerPoint	has	given	up.	The	text	that	you’re	looking	for just	isn’t	anywhere	in	the	presentation.	Maybe	you	spelled	it	wrong,	or	maybe	you didn’t	have	a	slide	about	Snarfblats	after	all. Match	case:	If	the	right	mix	of	uppercase	and	lowercase	letters	is	important	to	you, select	the	Match	Case	check	box	before	beginning	the	search.	This	option	is	handy when	you	have,	for	example,	a	presentation	about	Mr.	Smith	the	Blacksmith. Find	whole	words:	Use	the	Find	Whole	Words	Only	check	box	to	find	your	text only	when	it	appears	as	a	whole	word.	If	you	want	to	find	the	slide	on	which	you discuss	Smitty	the	Blacksmith’s	mitt,	for	example,	type	mitt	for	the	Find	What	text and	select	the	Find	Whole	Words	Only	check	box.	That	way,	the	Find	command looks	for	mitt	as	a	separate	word.	It	doesn’t	stop	to	show	you	the	mitt	in	Smitty. Replace	text:	If	you	find	the	text	that	you’re	looking	for	and	decide	that	you	want to	replace	it	with	something	else,	click	the	Replace	button.	This	step	changes	the Find	dialog	box	to	the	Replace	dialog	box,	which	is	explained	in	the	following section. Close	the	Find	dialog	box:	To	make	the	Find	dialog	box	go	away,	click	the	Close button	or	press	Esc.   Replacing	Text  Suppose	that	the	Rent-a-Nerd	company	decides	to	switch	to	athletic	consulting,	so	it wants	to	change	the	name	of	its	company	to	Rent-a-Jock.	Easy.	Just	use	the	handy Replace	command	to	change	all	occurrences	of	the	word	Nerd	to	Jock.	The	following steps	show	you	how:  1.	  	Click	the	Replace	button	 found	in	the	Editing	group	on	the	Home	tab  on	the	Ribbon 	or	use	the	keyboard	shortcut	Ctrl+H. The	Replace	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	2-4,	appears.  2.	 In	the	Find	What	box,	type	the	text	that	you	want	to	find.  Enter	the	text	that	you	want	to	replace	with	something	else	 Nerd,	in	this	example .  3.	 Type	the	replacement	text	in	the	Replace	With	box.  Enter	the	text	you	want	to	use	to	replace	the	text	that	you	typed	in	the	Find	What box	 Jock,	in	this	example . 4.	 Click	the	Find	Next	button.  PowerPoint	finds	the	first	occurrence	of	the	text.  5.	 Click	the	Replace	button	to	replace	the	text.  Read	the	text	first	to	make	sure	that	it	found	what	you’re	looking	for. 6.	 Repeat	the	Find	Next	and	Replace	sequence	until	you’re	finished. 7.	 Click	Find	Next	to	find	the	next	occurrence,	click	Replace	to	replace	it,	and	so	on.  Keep	going	until	you	finish.  Figure	2-4:	The	Replace	dialog	box.  If	you’re	absolutely	positive	that	you	want	to	replace	all	occurrences	of	your	Find	What text	with	the	Replace	With	text,	click	the	Replace	All	button.	This	step	dispenses	with the	Find	Next	and	Replace	cycle.	The	only	problem	is	that	you’re	bound	to	find	at	least one	spot	where	you	didn’t	want	the	replacement	to	occur.	Replacing	the	word	mitt	with glove,	for	example,	results	in	Sglovey	rather	than	Smitty.	Don’t	forget	that	you	can	also use	the	Find	Whole	Words	Only	option	to	find	and	replace	text	only	if	it	appears	as	an entire	word. If	you	totally	mess	up	your	presentation	by	clicking	Replace	All,	you	can	use	the	Undo   command	to	restore	sanity	to	your	presentation.   Rearranging	Your	Slides	in	Slide	Sorter View  Normal	View	is	the	view	that	you	normally	work	in	to	edit	your	slides,	move	things around,	add	text	or	graphics,	and	so	on.	However,	Normal	View	has	one	serious limitation:	It	doesn’t	give	you	a	big	picture	of	your	presentation.	You	can	see	the	details of	only	one	slide	at	a	time,	and	the	Slide	Preview	pane	lets	you	see	snapshots	of	only	a few	slides.	To	see	an	overall	view	of	your	presentation,	you	need	to	work	in	Slide Sorter	View. You	can	switch	to	Slide	Sorter	View	in	two	easy	ways:  	Click	the	Slide	Sorter	button	at	the	right	side	of	the	status	bar	 as	shown	in  Figure	2-5 . Select	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Slide	Sorter	button	in	the Presentation	Views	group.  Figure	2-5:	Slide	Sorter	View	lets	you	see	the	big	picture.  The	PowerPoint	Slide	Sorter	View	is	shown	in	Figure	2-5. The	following	list	tells	you	how	to	rearrange,	add,	or	delete	slides	from	Slide	Sorter View:  Move	a	slide:	To	move	a	slide,	click	and	drag	it	to	a	new	location.	Point	to	the	slide and	then	hold	down	the	mouse	button.	Drag	the	slide	to	its	new	location	and	release the	button.	PowerPoint	adjusts	the	display	to	show	the	new	arrangement	of	slides.   Delete	a	slide:	To	delete	a	slide,	click	the	slide	to	select	it	and	then	press	Delete	or Backspace.	This	works	only	in	Slide	Sorter	View. Add	a	new	slide:	To	add	a	new	slide,	click	the	slide	that	you	want	the	new	slide	to follow	and	then	click	the	New	Slide	button.	The	Slide	Layout	task	pane	appears	so that	you	can	select	the	layout	for	the	new	slide.	To	edit	the	contents	of	the	slide, return	to	Normal	View	via	the	view	buttons	 shown	in	Figure	2-5 	or	the	View	tab on	the	Ribbon	or	by	double-clicking	the	new	slide.  	If	your	presentation	contains	more	slides	than	can	fit	onscreen	at	one	time,	you  can	use	the	scroll	bars	to	scroll	through	the	display.	Or	you	can	use	the	zoom slider	at	the	bottom-right	corner	of	the	screen	to	make	the	slides	smaller.  Slide	Sorter	View	might	seem	kind	of	dull	and	boring,	but	it’s	also	the	place	where	you can	add	jazzy	transitions,	build	effects,	or	add	cool	animation	effects	to	your	slides.	For example,	you	can	make	your	bullets	fall	from	the	top	of	the	screen	like	bombs	and switch	from	slide	to	slide	by	using	strips,	wipes,	or	blinds.	Chapter	9	describes	all	this cool	stuff.   Chapter	3   Working	in	Outline	View  In	This	Chapter  	Understanding	the	outline 	Focusing	on	substance	instead	of	form 	Promoting	and	demoting,	and	the	lateral	arabesque 	Adding	a	slide	in	the	Outline	tab 	Collapsing	and	expanding	the	outline  Many	presentations	consist	of	slide	after	slide	of	bulleted	lists.	You	might	see	a	chart here	or	there	and	an	occasional	bit	of	clip	art	thrown	in	for	comic	effect,	but	the	bread and	butter	of	the	presentation	is	the	bulleted	list.	It	sounds	boring	—	and	it	often	is.	But in	some	cases,	an	endless	stream	of	bullet	points	turns	out	to	be	the	best	way	to	get	you through. Such	presentations	lend	themselves	especially	well	to	outlining.	PowerPoint’s	Outline View	lets	you	focus	on	your	presentation’s	main	points	and	subpoints.	In	other	words, it	enables	you	to	focus	on	content	without	worrying	about	appearance.   Calling	Up	the	Outline  	In	Normal	View,	the	left	side	of	the	PowerPoint	window	is	devoted	to	showing  thumbnail	images	of	your	slides.	But	you	can	easily	switch	your	presentation	into Outline	View	by	clicking	the	Outline	View	button	in	the	Ribbon’s	View	tab	 shown	in the	margin .	Then,	your	presentation	appears	as	an	outline,	with	the	title	of	each	slide as	a	separate	heading	at	the	highest	level	of	the	outline,	and	the	text	on	each	slide appears	as	lower-level	headings	subordinate	to	the	slide	headings.	See	Figure	3-1.  Note	that	if	a	slide	doesn’t	have	a	title,	the	slide	still	appears	in	the	outline,	but	the	top- level	heading	for	the	slide	is	blank.   Figure	3-1:	Viewing	the	outline.  	You	can	expand	the	area	devoted	to	the	outline	by	clicking	and	dragging	the  border	of	the	Outline	pane.  The	following	list	highlights	a	few	important	things	to	notice	about	the	outline:  The	outline	is	comprised	of	the	titles	and	body	text	of	each	slide.	Any	other objects	that	you	add	to	a	slide	—	such	as	pictures,	charts,	and	so	on	—	are	not included	in	the	outline.	Also,	if	you	add	any	text	objects	to	the	slide	in	addition	to the	basic	title	and	body	text	placeholders	in	the	slide	layout,	the	additional	text objects	are	not	included	in	the	outline. Each	slide	is	represented	by	a	high-level	heading	in	the	outline.	The	text	of	this heading	is	taken	from	the	slide’s	title,	and	an	icon	that	represents	the	entire	slide appears	next	to	the	heading.	Also,	the	slide	number	appears	to	the	left	of	the	Slide icon.   Each	text	line	from	a	slide’s	body	text	appears	as	an	indented	heading.	This heading	is	subordinate	to	the	slide’s	main	title	heading. An	outline	can	contain	subpoints	that	are	subordinate	to	the	main	points	on each	slide.	PowerPoint	enables	you	to	create	as	many	as	nine	heading	levels	on each	slide,	but	your	slides	will	probably	get	too	complicated	if	you	go	beyond	two headings.	You	can	find	more	about	working	with	heading	levels	in	the	section “Promoting	and	Demoting	Paragraphs,”	later	in	this	chapter.   Selecting	and	Editing	an	Entire	Slide  When	you	work	with	the	Outline	tab,	you	often	have	to	select	an	entire	slide.	You	can do	that	by	clicking	the	icon	for	the	slide.	This	selects	the	slide	title	and	all	its	body	text. In	addition,	any	extra	objects,	such	as	graphics,	that	are	on	the	slide	are	also	selected even	though	those	objects	don’t	appear	in	the	outline. You	can	delete,	cut,	copy,	or	duplicate	an	entire	slide:  Delete:	To	delete	an	entire	slide,	select	it	and	then	press	Delete. Cut	or	copy:	To	cut	or	copy	an	entire	slide	to	the	Clipboard,	select	the	slide	and then	press	Ctrl+X	 Cut 	or	Ctrl+C	 Copy ,	or	use	the	Cut	or	Copy	button	on	the Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	You	can	then	move	the	cursor	to	any	location	in	the outline	and	press	Ctrl+V	or	use	the	Paste	button	to	paste	the	slide	from	the Clipboard.	 You	can	also	cut	or	copy	a	slide	by	right-clicking	the	slide	and choosing	Cut	or	Copy	from	the	menu	that	appears.  Duplicate:	To	duplicate	a	slide,	select	it	and	then	press	Ctrl+D.	This	step	places	a copy	of	the	selected	slide	immediately	after	it.	 Actually,	you	don’t	have	to	select the	entire	slide	to	duplicate	it.	Just	click	anywhere	in	the	slide’s	title	or	body	text.    Selecting	and	Editing	One	Paragraph  You	can	select	and	edit	an	entire	paragraph	along	with	all	its	subordinate	paragraphs. To	do	so,	just	click	the	bullet	next	to	the	paragraph	that	you	want	to	select.	To	delete	an entire	paragraph	along	with	its	subordinate	paragraphs,	select	it	and	then	press	Delete. To	cut	or	copy	an	entire	paragraph	to	the	Clipboard	along	with	its	subordinates,	select	it and	then	press	Ctrl+X	 Cut 	or	Ctrl+C	 Copy .	You	can	then	press	Ctrl+V	to	paste	the paragraph	anywhere	in	the	presentation.   Promoting	and	Demoting	Paragraphs  To	promote	a	paragraph	is	to	move	it	up	one	level	in	the	outline.	If	you	promote	the “Psalm	46	encodes	a	tribute	to	Shakespeare”	paragraph	in	Figure	3-1,	for	example,	that paragraph	becomes	a	separate	slide	rather	than	a	bullet	under	“Shakespeare’s	Psalm.” 	To	promote	a	paragraph,	place	the	cursor	anywhere	in	the	paragraph	and	then	press Shift+Tab	or	click	the	Decrease	List	Level	button	in	the	Paragraph	group	on	the	Home tab.	 Note	that	you	can’t	promote	a	paragraph	that	is	already	at	the	highest	outline level.   	To	demote	a	paragraph	is	to	do	just	the	opposite:	The	paragraph	moves	down	one  level	in	the	outline.	If	you	demote	the	“Shakespeare	was	46	years	old	in	1611” paragraph	in	Figure	3-1,	it	becomes	a	subpoint	under	“King	James	Bible	published	in 1611”	rather	than	a	separate	main	point. To	demote	a	paragraph,	place	the	cursor	anywhere	in	the	paragraph	and	then	either press	the	Tab	key	or	click	the	Increase	List	Level	button	in	the	Paragraph	group	on	the Home	tab. Note	that	you	can’t	promote	a	slide	title.	Slide	title	is	the	highest	rank	in	the	outline hierarchy.	If	you	demote	a	slide	title,	the	entire	slide	is	subsumed	into	the	preceding slide.	In	other	words,	the	slide	title	becomes	a	main	point	in	the	preceding	slide. You	can	promote	or	demote	paragraphs	by	using	the	mouse,	but	the	technique	is	a	little tricky.	When	you	move	the	cursor	over	a	bullet	 or	the	Slide	button ,	the	pointer changes	from	a	single	arrow	to	a	four-cornered	arrow.	This	arrow	is	your	signal	that you	can	click	to	select	the	entire	paragraph	 and	any	subordinate	paragraphs .	Then, you	can	use	the	mouse	to	promote	or	demote	a	paragraph	along	with	all	its subordinates	by	dragging	the	selected	paragraph	left	or	right. Be	sensitive	when	you	demote	paragraphs.	Being	demoted	can	be	an	emotionally devastating	experience.   Adding	a	New	Paragraph  To	add	a	new	paragraph	to	a	slide	with	the	outline	that	appears	on	the	Outline	tab, move	the	insertion	point	to	the	end	of	the	paragraph	that	you	want	the	new	paragraph	to follow	and	then	press	Enter.	PowerPoint	creates	a	new	paragraph	at	the	same	outline level	as	the	preceding	paragraph. Note	that	if	you	move	the	insertion	point	to	the	end	of	the	title	line	and	press	Enter, PowerPoint	creates	a	new	slide.	However,	you	can	then	press	the	Tab	key	to	change	the new	slide	to	a	paragraph	on	the	preceding	slide. If	you	position	the	insertion	point	at	the	beginning	of	a	paragraph	and	press	Enter,	the new	paragraph	is	inserted	above	the	cursor	position.	If	you	position	the	cursor	in	the middle	of	a	paragraph	and	press	Enter,	the	paragraph	is	split	in	two. After	you	add	a	new	paragraph,	you	might	want	to	change	its	level	in	the	outline.	To	do that,	you	must	promote	or	demote	the	new	paragraph	 as	described	in	the	preceding section .	To	create	a	subpoint	for	a	main	point,	for	example,	position	the	cursor	at	the end	of	the	main	point	and	press	Enter.	Then,	demote	the	new	paragraph	by	pressing	the Tab	key.   Adding	a	New	Slide  You	can	add	a	new	slide	in	many	ways	when	you’re	working	with	the	outline.	This	list shows	the	most	popular	methods:  Promote	existing	text:	Promote	an	existing	paragraph	to	the	highest	level.	This method	splits	a	slide	into	two	slides. Promote	new	text:	Add	a	new	paragraph	and	then	promote	it	to	the	highest	level. Press	Enter:	Place	the	cursor	in	a	slide’s	title	text	and	press	Enter.	This	method creates	a	new	slide	before	the	current	slide.	Whether	the	title	text	stays	with	the current	slide,	goes	with	the	new	slide,	or	is	split	between	the	slides	depends	on	the location	of	the	cursor	within	the	title	when	you	press	Enter. Press	Ctrl+Enter:	Place	the	cursor	anywhere	in	a	slide’s	body	text	and	press Ctrl+Enter.	This	method	creates	a	new	slide	immediately	following	the	current slide.	The	position	of	the	cursor	within	the	existing	slide	doesn’t	matter;	the	new slide	is	always	created	after	the	current	slide.	 The	cursor	must	be	in	the	slide’s body	text,	however,	in	order	for	this	method	to	work.	If	you	put	the	cursor	in	a	slide title	and	press	Ctrl+Enter,	the	cursor	jumps	to	the	slide’s	body	text	without	creating a	new	slide.  Insert	a	new	slide:	Place	the	cursor	anywhere	in	the	slide	and	use	the	keyboard shortcut	Ctrl+M	or	click	the	Add	Slide	button	in	the	Slides	group	of	the	Home Ribbon	tab. Duplicate	an	existing	slide:	Select	an	existing	slide	by	clicking	the	slide’s	icon	or triple-clicking	the	title,	and	then	press	Ctrl+D	to	duplicate	it.  	Because	the	outline	focuses	on	slide	content	rather	than	on	layout,	new	slides  receive	the	basic	Title	and	Content	layout,	which	includes	title	text	and	body	text formatted	with	bullets.   Moving	Text	Up	and	Down  The	outline	is	a	handy	way	to	rearrange	your	presentation.	You	can	easily	change	the order	of	individual	points	on	a	slide,	or	you	can	rearrange	the	order	of	the	slides. You	can	rearrange	your	presentation	by	right-clicking	the	paragraphs	that	you	want	to move	and	then	clicking	the	Move	Up	or	Move	Down	button	in	the	menu	that	appears. Or	you	can	point	to	the	bullet	next	to	the	paragraph	that	you	want	to	move.	Then,	when the	cursor	changes	to	the	four-cornered	arrow,	click	and	drag	the	paragraph	up	or down.	A	horizontal	line	appears,	showing	the	horizontal	position	of	the	selection. Release	the	mouse	button	when	the	horizontal	line	is	positioned	where	you	want	the text.  	Be	careful	when	you’re	moving	text	in	a	slide	that	has	more	than	one	level	of body	text	paragraphs.	Notice	the	position	of	the	horizontal	line	when	you	drag	the selection;	the	entire	selection	is	inserted	at	that	location,	which	might	split	up subpoints.	If	you	don’t	like	the	result	of	a	move,	you	can	always	undo	it	by pressing	Ctrl+Z	or	clicking	the	Undo	button.   Collapsing	and	Expanding	the	Outline  If	your	presentation	has	many	slides,	you	might	find	that	grasping	its	overall	structure is	difficult,	even	when	looking	at	the	outline.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint	enables	you	to collapse	the	outline	so	that	only	the	slide	titles	are	shown.	Collapsing	an	outline doesn’t	delete	the	body	text;	it	merely	hides	the	body	text	so	that	you	can	focus	on	the order	of	the	slides	in	your	presentation. Expanding	a	presentation	restores	the	collapsed	body	text	to	the	outline	so	that	you	can once	again	focus	on	details.	You	can	collapse	and	expand	an	entire	presentation,	or	you can	collapse	and	expand	one	slide	at	a	time. To	collapse	the	entire	presentation,	right-click	anywhere	in	the	outline	and	then	choose Collapse ⇒ Collapse	All	or	use	the	keyboard	shortcut	Alt+Shift+1.	To	expand	the presentation,	right-click	and	choose	Expand ⇒ Expand	All	or	press	Alt+Shift+9. To	collapse	a	single	slide,	right-click	anywhere	in	the	slide	and	then	choose	Collapse  ⇒ Collapse	from	the	menu	that	appears.	To	expand	a	single	slide,	right-click	the collapsed	slide	and	choose	Expand ⇒ Expand.   Chapter	4   Proofing	Your	Presentations  In	This	Chapter  	Checking	your	spelling 	Using	the	Thesaurus 	Capitalizing	and	punctuating	the	right	way 	Using	the	AutoCorrect	feature  I was	voted	Worst	Speller	in	the	sixth	grade.	Not	that	being	Worst	Speller	qualifies	me to	run	for	president	or	anything,	but	it	shows	how	much	I	appreciate	computer	spell checkers.	Spelling	makes	no	sense	to	me.	I	felt	a	little	better	after	watching	The	Story of	English	on	public	television.	Now	at	least	I	know	whom	to	blame	for	all	the peculiarities	of	English	spelling	—	the	Anglos,	the	Norms	 including	the	guy	from Cheers ,	and	the	Saxophones. Fortunately,	PowerPoint	2016	has	a	pretty	decent	spell	checker.	In	fact,	the	spell checker	in	PowerPoint	is	so	smart	that	it	knows	that	you’ve	made	a	spelling	mistake almost	before	you	make	it.	The	spell	checker	watches	over	your	shoulder	as	you	type and	helps	you	to	correct	your	spelling	errors	as	you	work.   Checking	Spelling	as	You	Go  Spelling	errors	in	a	word-processing	document	are	bad,	but	at	least	they’re	small.	In	a PowerPoint	presentation,	spelling	errors	are	small	only	until	you	use	a	projector	to throw	your	presentation	onto	a	30-foot	screen.	Then	they	get	all	blown	out	of proportion.	Nothing	is	more	embarrassing	than	a	3-foot-tall	spelling	error.	And	if you’re	like	me,	you	probably	try	to	look	for	mistakes	in	other	people’s	presentations just	for	kicks.	Thank	goodness	for	PowerPoint’s	on-the-fly	spell	checker. The	PowerPoint	spell	checker	doesn’t	make	you	wait	until	you	finish	your	presentation and	run	a	special	command	to	point	out	your	spelling	errors.	It	boldly	points	out	your mistakes	right	when	you	make	them	by	underlining	any	word	it	doesn’t	recognize	with a	wavy	red	line,	as	shown	on	the	word	“yars”	in	the	second	bullet	point	in	Figure	4-1.  Figure	4-1:	PowerPoint	usually	knows	before	you	do	that	you’ve	misspelled	a	word.  When	you	see	the	telltale	wavy	red	line,	you	have	several	options:  Make	the	correction:	You	can	retype	the	word	using	the	correct	spelling. Let	PowerPoint	help:	You	can	right-click	the	word	to	call	up	a	menu	that	lists suggested	spellings	for	the	word.	In	most	cases,	PowerPoint	can	figure	out	what you	meant	to	type	and	suggests	the	correct	spelling.	To	replace	the	misspelled	word with	the	correct	spelling,	just	click	the	correctly	spelled	word	in	the	menu. Ignore	the	misspelling:	Sometimes,	you	want	to	misspell	a	word	on	purpose	 for example,	if	you	run	a	restaurant	named	“The	Koffee	Kup” .	More	likely,	the	word is	correctly	spelled,	but	PowerPoint	just	doesn’t	know	about	the	word.	The	right- click	menu	will	help	in	either	case:	You	can	right-click	the	word	in	question	and then	choose	either	Ignore	All	to	ignore	the	misspelling	or	Add	to	Dictionary	to	add it	to	PowerPoint’s	spelling	dictionary.   	The	spell	checker	can’t	tell	you	when	you’ve	used	the	wrong	word	but	spelled  it	correctly.	For	example,	the	second	bullet	point	in	Figure	4-1	mentions	dime navels	instead	of	dime	novels.	Cheap	literature	might	be	a	bad	thing,	but	cheap citrus	certainly	is	not.   Spell	Checking	After-the-Fact  If	you	prefer	to	ignore	the	constant	nagging	by	PowerPoint	about	your	spelling,	you can	always	check	your	spelling	the	old-fashioned	way:	by	running	the	spell	checker after	you	finish	your	document.	The	spell	checker	works	its	way	through	your	entire presentation,	looking	up	every	word	in	its	massive	list	of	correctly	spelled	words	and bringing	any	misspelled	words	to	your	attention.	It	performs	this	task	without	giggling or	snickering.	As	an	added	bonus,	the	spell	checker	even	gives	you	the	opportunity	to tell	it	that	you’re	right	and	it’s	wrong	and	that	it	should	discern	how	to	spell	words	the way	you	do. The	following	steps	show	you	how	to	check	the	spelling	for	an	entire	presentation:  1.	 If	the	presentation	that	you	want	to	spell	check	is	not	already	open,	open	it.  2.	  	Open	the	Review	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Spelling	button  found	in	the	Proofing	group	 shown	in	the	margin .  3.	 Tap	your	fingers	on	your	desk.  PowerPoint	is	searching	your	presentation	for	embarrassing	spelling	errors.	Be patient.  4.	 Don’t	be	startled	if	PowerPoint	finds	a	spelling	error.  If	PowerPoint	finds	a	spelling	error	in	your	presentation,	it	switches	to	the	slide	that contains	the	error,	highlights	the	offensive	word,	and	displays	the	misspelled	word along	with	a	suggested	correction,	as	shown	in	Figure	4-2.  5.	 Choose	the	correct	spelling	and	click	the	Change	button.	Alternatively,	click  Ignore	and	laugh	in	PowerPoint’s	face. If	you	agree	that	the	word	is	misspelled,	scan	the	list	of	corrections	that	PowerPoint offers	and	select	the	one	that	you	like.	Then	click	the	Change	button. If	you	like	the	way	that	you	spelled	the	word	in	the	first	place	 maybe	it’s	an unusual	word	that	isn’t	in	the	PowerPoint	spelling	dictionary,	or	maybe	you	like	to spell	the	way	Chaucer	did ,	click	the	Ignore	button.	Watch	as	PowerPoint	turns	red in	the	face. If	you	want	PowerPoint	to	ignore	all	occurrences	of	a	particular	misspelling	within the	current	presentation,	click	the	Ignore	All	button.	Likewise,	if	you	want PowerPoint	to	correct	all	occurrences	of	a	particular	misspelling,	click	the	Change All	button.  6.	 Repeat	Steps	4	and	5	until	PowerPoint	gives	up.  When	you	see	the	following	message,	you’re	finished:  Spell	check	complete.	You’re	good	to	go!   Figure	4-2:	The	PowerPoint	spell	checker	points	out	a	boo-boo.  PowerPoint	always	checks	spelling	in	the	entire	presentation,	beginning	with	the	first slide	—	unless	you	specify	a	single	word	or	group	of	words	by	highlighting	them	first. PowerPoint	checks	the	spelling	of	titles,	body	text,	notes,	and	text	objects	added	to slides.	It	doesn’t	check	the	spelling	in	embedded	objects,	however,	such	as	charts	or graphs.  	If	you	get	tired	of	PowerPoint	always	complaining	about	a	word	that’s	not	in its	standard	dictionary,	click	Add	to	add	the	word	to	the	custom	dictionary.	If	you can’t	sleep	at	night	until	you	know	more	about	the	custom	dictionary,	read	the following	sidebar	titled	“Don’t	make	me	tell	you	about	the	custom	dictionary.”  	The	PowerPoint	spell	checker	is	good,	but	it	isn’t	perfect.	It	does	a	reasonably good	job	of	catching	your	when	you	meant	you’re	or	its	when	you	meant	it’s.	But it	can’t	catch	an	error	such	as	“In	a	few	ours	we	can	go	home.”	Thus,	spell checking	is	no	substitute	for	good,	old-fashioned	proofreading.	Print	your presentation,	sit	down	with	a	cup	of	cappuccino,	and	read	it.   Don’t	make	me	tell	you	about	the	custom	dictionary The	PowerPoint	spell	checker	can	use	more	than	one	spelling	dictionary.	Besides	the	standard	dictionary,	which contains	untold	thousands	of	words	that	were	all	reviewed	for	correctness	by	Noah	Webster	himself	 just	kidding , you	can	have	one	or	more	custom	dictionaries,	which	contain	words	that	you	have	added	by	clicking	the	Add	button when	the	spell	checker	found	a	spelling	error. Custom	dictionaries	are	shared	by	other	Microsoft	programs	that	use	spell	checkers	—	most	notably	Microsoft Word.	So	if	you	add	a	word	to	a	custom	dictionary	in	Word,	the	PowerPoint	spell	checker	knows	about	the	word, too. What	if	you	accidentally	add	a	word	to	the	dictionary?	Then	you	have	a	serious	problem.	You	have	two	alternatives. You	can	petition	Noah	Webster	to	have	your	variant	spelling	officially	added	to	the	English	language,	or	you	can edit	the	Custom.dic	file,	search	through	the	file	until	you	find	the	bogus	word,	and	then	delete	it.	The	easiest	way	to edit	the	Custom.dic	file	is	to	click	the	File	tab,	and	then	in	Backstage	View,	click	Options,	click	Proofing,	and	then click	the	Custom	Dictionaries	button.	You	can	then	select	the	Custom.dic	file	and	click	Edit	Word	List	to	edit	its contents.   Using	the	Thesaurus  PowerPoint	includes	a	built-in	thesaurus	that	can	quickly	show	you	synonyms	for	a word	that	you’ve	typed.	Using	it	is	easy:  1.	 Right-click	a	word	that	you’ve	typed	and	choose	Synonyms	from	the	menu  that	appears. A	menu	listing	synonyms	for	the	word	appears.	 Sometimes	PowerPoint	throws	an antonym	into	the	list	just	to	be	contrary.   2.	 Select	the	word	that	you	want	to	use	to	replace	your	word. 3.	 PowerPoint	replaces	the	original	word	with	your	selection.  	If	you	choose	Thesaurus	from	the	Synonyms	menu	or	click	the	Thesaurus  button	in	the	Ribbon	 shown	in	the	margin ,	the	Thesaurus	section	of	the	Research	task pane	appears	with	the	synonyms	listed,	as	shown	in	Figure	4-3.	The	Thesaurus	lets	you look	up	words	to	find	even	more	synonyms.	For	example,	if	you	select	falloff	from	the list	of	synonyms,	you	get	another	set	of	words.	You	can	keep	clicking	words	to	find other	synonyms	as	long	as	you’d	like,	until	you’re	ready	to	get	back	to	real	work.  Figure	4-3:	The	Thesaurus	appears	in	the	Research	task	pane.   Capitalizing	Correctly  The	PowerPoint	Change	Case	command	enables	you	to	capitalize	the	text	in	your slides	properly.	These	steps	show	you	how	to	use	it:  1.	 Select	the	text	that	you	want	to	capitalize. 2.	  	Choose	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Change	Case  button	in	the	Font	section	 shown	in	the	margin . Doing	so	reveals	a	menu	of	Change	Case	choices.  3.	 Study	the	options	for	a	moment	and	then	click	the	one	that	you	want.  Here	are	the	case	options:  Sentence	case:	The	first	letter	of	the	first	word	in	each	sentence	is capitalized.	Everything	else	is	changed	to	lowercase. lowercase:	Everything	is	changed	to	lowercase. UPPERCASE:	Everything	is	changed	to	capital	letters. Capitalize	Each	Word:	The	first	letter	of	each	word	is	capitalized. tOGGLE	cASE:	This	option	turns	uppercase	into	lowercase	and	turns lowercase	into	uppercase,	for	a	ransom-note	look.  4.	 Check	the	results.  	Always	double-check	your	text	after	using	the	Change	Case	command	to	make  sure	that	the	result	is	what	you	intended.	This	is	especially	true	when	you	select Capitalize	Each	Word.	In	most	cases,	you	should	not	capitalize	articles	 like	a	and	the  and	prepositions	 like	of	and	from .	The	Capitalize	Each	Word	option	capitalizes	every word	in	the	title,	so	you’ll	have	to	manually	change	articles	and	prepositions	back	to lowercase. Slide	titles	should	almost	always	use	title	case.	The	first	level	of	bullets	on	a	slide	can use	title	case,	where	all	words	except	articles	like	a	or	the	and	prepositions	like	for	and to	are	capitalized,	or	sentence	case,	where	only	the	first	word	of	each	sentence	is capitalized.	Lower	levels	usually	should	use	sentence	case.  	Avoid	uppercase	if	you	can.	IT’S	HARD	TO	READ	AND	LOOKS	LIKE  YOU’RE	SHOUTING.   Using	the	AutoCorrect	Feature  PowerPoint	includes	an	AutoCorrect	feature	that	can	automatically	correct	spelling errors	and	style	errors	as	you	type	them.	For	example,	if	you	accidentally	type	teh, PowerPoint	automatically	changes	your	text	to	the.	And	if	you	forget	to	capitalize	the first	word	of	a	sentence,	PowerPoint	automatically	capitalizes	it	for	you.	AutoCorrect can	even	catch	certain	multi-word	mistakes.	For	example,	if	you	type	their	are, AutoCorrect	will	substitute	there	are.  	Any	time	PowerPoint	makes	a	correction	that	you	don’t	like,	just	press	Ctrl+Z  to	undo	the	correction.	For	example,	if	you	really	intended	to	type	teh,	press Ctrl+Z	immediately	after	PowerPoint	corrects	it	to	the.  If	you	move	the	insertion	pointer	back	to	a	word	that	has	been	corrected	 or	if	you	click the	word ,	a	small	blue	line	appears	beneath	the	first	letter	of	the	word.	Point	the	mouse at	this	blue	line,	and	the	button	with	a	lightning	bolt	in	it	appears.	You	can	then	click this	button	to	bring	up	a	menu	that	enables	you	to	undo	the	correction	that	was	made, tell	PowerPoint	to	stop	making	that	type	of	correction,	or	summon	the	AutoCorrect options	dialog	box	to	adjust	your	AutoCorrect	settings. To	control	PowerPoint’s	AutoCorrect	feature,	click	the	File	tab	to	switch	to	Backstage View	and	then	click	Options.	This	summons	the	PowerPoint	Options	dialog	box.	Next, choose	the	Proofing	tab	on	the	left	side	of	the	PowerPoint	Options	dialog	box,	and	then click	the	AutoCorrect	Options	button	to	display	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	4-4.   Figure	4-4:	The	AutoCorrect	Options	dialog	box.  As	you	can	see,	the	AutoCorrect	Options	dialog	box	contains	check	boxes	for	a	variety of	options	that	govern	how	AutoCorrect	works:  Show	AutoCorrect	Options	buttons:	This	option	displays	the	AutoCorrect	button beneath	words	that	were	changed	by	the	AutoCorrect	feature,	which	allows	you	to undo	the	change	or	tell	PowerPoint	to	stop	making	that	particular	type	of correction. Correct	TWo	INitial	CApitals:	Looks	for	words	with	two	initial	capitals	and changes	the	second	one	to	lowercase.	For	example,	if	you	type	BOther,	PowerPoint changes	it	to	Bother.	However,	if	you	type	three	or	more	capitals	in	a	row, PowerPoint	assumes	that	you	did	it	on	purpose,	so	no	correction	is	made. Capitalize	first	letter	of	sentences:	Automatically	capitalizes	the	first	word	of	a new	sentence	if	you	forget. Capitalize	first	letter	of	table	cells:	Automatically	capitalizes	the	first	word	in table	cells. Capitalize	names	of	days:	You	know,	Monday,	Tuesday,	Wednesday,	and	so	forth. Correct	accidental	use	of	cAPS	LOCK	key:	This	is	an	especially	cool	feature.	If PowerPoint	notices	that	you’re	capitalizing	everything	backwards,	it	assumes	that you	accidentally	pressed	the	Caps	Lock	key.	So	it	turns	off	Caps	Lock	and	corrects the	words	that	you	capitalized	backwards. Replace	text	as	you	type:	This	option	is	the	heart	of	the	AutoCorrect	feature.	It consists	of	a	list	of	words	that	are	frequently	typed	wrong,	along	with	the replacement	word.	For	example,	teh	is	replaced	by	the,	and	adn	is	replaced	by	and. The	AutoCorrect	list	also	contains	some	shortcuts	for	special	symbols.	For example,	 c 	is	replaced	by	the	copyright	symbol	   ,	and	 tm 	is	replaced	by	the trademark	symbol	 ™ .  	You	can	add	your	own	words	to	this	list.	In	the	Replace	text	box,	type	the word	that	you	want	PowerPoint	to	watch	for.	In	the	With	text	box,	type	the	word that	you	want	PowerPoint	to	substitute	for	the	first	word.	Then	click	Add.  The	AutoCorrect	feature	also	includes	several	formatting	options	that	can	automatically apply	formats	as	you	type.	To	set	these	options,	click	the	AutoFormat	As	You	Type	tab. The	options	shown	in	Figure	4-5	appear.	These	options	let	you	control	formatting features,	such	as	automatically	converting	straight	quotes	to	curly	quotes,	changing fractions	such	as	1 2	to	fraction	symbols	such	as	½,	and	so	on.   Figure	4-5:	The	AutoFormat	As	You	Type	options.   Chapter	5   Don’t	Forget	Your	Notes!  In	This	Chapter  	Creating	speaker	notes	to	get	you	through	your	presentation 	Adjusting	the	notes	page	to	make	long	notes	fit 	Adding	a	new	slide	from	Notes	Page	View 	Printing	your	notes	pages  Ever	had	the	fear	—	or	maybe	the	actual	experience	—	of	showing	a	beautiful	slide, complete	with	snappy	text	and	perhaps	an	exquisite	chart,	and	suddenly	forgetting	why you	included	the	slide	in	the	first	place?	You	stumble	for	words.	“Well,	as	you	can	see, this	is	a	beautiful	chart,	and,	uh,	this	slide	makes	the	irrefutable	point	that,	uh,	well,	I’m not	sure	—	are	there	any	questions?” Fear	not!	One	of	the	slickest	features	in	PowerPoint	2016	is	its	capability	to	create speaker	notes	to	help	you	get	through	your	presentation.	You	can	make	these	notes	as complete	or	as	sketchy	as	you	want	or	need.	You	can	write	a	complete	script	for	your presentation	or	just	jot	down	a	few	key	points	to	refresh	your	memory. The	best	part	about	speaker	notes	is	that	you’re	the	only	one	who	sees	them.	They don’t	actually	show	up	on	your	slides	for	all	the	world	to	see.	Instead,	notes	pages	are displayed	separately	on	your	computer’s	monitor	but	not	displayed	by	the	projector. And,	you	can	print	your	notes	pages	so	that	you	can	have	them	available	as	a	handy reference	during	your	presentation.  Don’t	you	think	that	it’s	about	time	for	a	short	chapter?	Although	notes	pages	are	one of	the	slickest	features	in	PowerPoint,	creating	notes	pages	isn’t	all	that	complicated	— hence	the	brevity	of	this	chapter.   Understanding	Notes  Notes	are	like	an	adjunct	attachment	to	your	slides.	They	don’t	appear	on	the	slides themselves	but	are	displayed	separately.	Each	slide	in	your	presentation	has	its	own page	of	notes. Notes	are	usually	hidden	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen	in	a	tiny	Notes	pane	that’s	just large	enough	to	display	a	line	or	two	of	text.	You	can	recognize	the	Notes	pane	because it	initially	contains	the	words	“Click	to	add	notes.”	To	work	with	notes,	you	should	first enlarge	the	Notes	pane	to	give	yourself	some	room	to	work.	For	more	information,	see the	section	“Adding	Notes	to	a	Slide,”	later	in	this	chapter.  	PowerPoint	also	has	a	separate	view	designed	for	working	with	notes	pages,  called	 you	guessed	it 	Notes	Page	View.	To	call	up	Notes	Page	View,	choose	the	View tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Notes	Page	button	found	in	the	Presentation	Views group	 this	button	is	shown	in	the	margin .	Each	Notes	Page	consists	of	a	reduced version	of	the	slide	and	an	area	for	notes,	as	shown	in	Figure	5-1.  Figure	5-1:	Notes	Page	View	lets	you	see	your	notes.  Depending	on	the	size	of	your	monitor,	these	notes	are	too	small	to	see	or	work	with	in Notes	Page	View	unless	you	increase	the	zoom	setting.	But	on	smaller	monitors,	you can	zoom	in	to	see	your	work. Unfortunately,	no	keyboard	shortcut	is	available	to	switch	directly	to	Notes	Page	View. Earlier	versions	of	PowerPoint	included	a	button	for	this	alongside	the	other	view buttons	in	the	lower-right	corner	of	the	screen.	But	for	some	mysterious	reason, Microsoft	decided	to	omit	this	button	in	recent	versions	of	PowerPoint.	So	the	only way	to	get	to	Notes	Page	View	now	is	to	use	the	Ribbon’s	Notes	Page	button.   Adding	Notes	to	a	Slide  To	add	notes	to	a	slide,	as	shown	in	Figure	5-2,	follow	this	procedure:  Figure	5-2:	A	slide	with	notes.  1.	 In	Normal	View,	move	to	the	slide	to	which	you	want	to	add	notes. 2.	 Click	and	drag	the	Notes	pane	border,	if	necessary,	to	bring	the	notes	text	into  view.  3.	 Click	the	notes	text	object,	where	it	reads	Click	to	add	notes. 4.	 Type	away.  The	text	that	you	type	appears	in	the	notes	area.	As	you	create	your	notes,	you	can	use any	of	the	PowerPoint	standard	word-processing	features,	such	as	Cut,	Copy,	and Paste.	Press	Enter	to	create	new	paragraphs. Note	that	there	is	also	a	Notes	button	in	the	status	bar	at	the	bottom	of	the	PowerPoint screen.	You	can	click	this	button	to	hide	or	reveal	notes.   Adding	an	Extra	Notes	Page	for	a	Slide  PowerPoint	doesn’t	provide	a	way	to	add	more	than	one	page	of	notes	for	each	slide. However,	these	steps	show	you	a	trick	that	accomplishes	essentially	the	same	thing:  1.	 Create	a	duplicate	slide	immediately	following	the	slide	that	requires	two  pages	of	notes. To	duplicate	the	slide,	move	to	the	slide	that	you	want	to	duplicate	in	Normal	View and	press	Ctrl+D	to	duplicate	the	slide.  2.	 Click	the	Notes	Page	button	in	the	Presentation	Views	group	of	the	View	tab.  The	Notes	Page	for	the	new	duplicate	slide	appears.  3.	 Delete	the	slide	object	at	the	top	of	the	duplicate	notes	page.  To	do	so,	click	the	slide	object	at	the	top	of	the	page	and	press	Delete.  4.	 Extend	the	notes	area	up	so	that	it	fills	the	page.  To	extend	the	notes	area,	just	drag	the	top-center	love	handle	of	the	notes	area	up.  5.	 Type	the	additional	notes	for	the	preceding	slide	on	this	new	notes	page.  Add	a	heading,	such	as	“Continued	from	slide	23,”	at	the	top	of	the	text	to	help	you remember	that	this	portion	is	a	continuation	of	notes	from	the	preceding	slide.  6.	 Return	to	Normal	View.  Click	the	Normal	button	in	the	Presentation	Views	group	of	the	View	tab.  7.	 Open	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Hide	Slide	button	in  the	Set	Up	group. The	Hide	Slide	button	hides	the	slide,	which	means	that	it	isn’t	included	in	an onscreen	slide	show.  The	result	of	this	trick	is	that	you	now	have	two	pages	of	notes	for	a	single	slide,	and the	second	notes	page	doesn’t	have	an	image	of	the	slide	on	it	and	is	not	included	in your	slide	show. If	you’re	printing	overhead	transparencies,	you	might	want	to	deselect	the	Print	Hidden Slides	check	box	in	the	Print	dialog	box.	This	way,	the	hidden	slide	isn’t	printed.	Be sure	to	select	the	check	box	when	you	print	the	notes	pages,	though.	Otherwise,	the notes	page	for	the	hidden	slide	isn’t	printed	either	—	and	the	reason	you	created	the hidden	slide	in	the	first	place	was	to	print	a	notes	page	for	it!  	Think	twice	before	creating	a	second	page	of	notes	for	a	slide.	Do	you	really have	that	much	to	say	about	a	single	slide?	Maybe	the	slide	contains	too	much	to begin	with	and	should	be	split	into	two	slides.   Adding	a	New	Slide	from	Notes	Page	View  If	you’re	working	in	Notes	Page	View	and	realize	that	you	want	to	create	a	new	slide, you	don’t	have	to	return	to	Normal	View.	Just	click	the	Add	Slide	button	in	the	Slides group	on	the	Home	tab	to	add	the	new	slide.	Or	press	Ctrl+M. If	you	want	to	work	on	the	slide’s	appearance	or	contents,	however,	you	must	switch back	to	Normal	View.	You	can’t	modify	a	slide’s	appearance	or	contents	from	Notes Page	View.   Printing	Notes	Pages  If	you	don’t	have	a	computer	that	can	show	your	slides	on	a	projector	and	your	notes on	a	separate	monitor,	you	can	always	print	your	notes	on	paper	and	then	use	the printed	notes	while	you	give	your	presentation.	These	steps	show	you	how	to	print	your notes:  1.	 Choose	the	Print	command	from	the	File	tab.  The	Print	page	appears	in	Backstage	view.  2.	 In	the	second	selection	box	under	Settings,	choose	Notes	Pages. 3.	 Make	sure	that	the	Print	Hidden	Slides	check	box	is	selected	if	you	want	to  print	notes	pages	for	hidden	slides. The	Print	Hidden	Slides	check	box	is	located	on	the	first	selection	box	under Settings.	This	check	box	is	dimmed	if	the	presentation	doesn’t	have	any	hidden slides.  4.	 Click	OK	or	press	Enter.  You	can	find	more	information	about	printing	in	Chapter	6.   Displaying	Notes	on	a	Separate	Monitor  As	you	discover	in	the	next	chapter,	PowerPoint	can	display	your	presentation	in	a special	mode	called	Presenter	View,	which	displays	the	slides	on	a	projector	and helpful	information	that	includes	your	notes	on	your	computer’s	main	monitor.	As shown	in	Figure	5-3,	Presenter	View	shows	the	main	slide	on	the	left	and	a	thumbnail of	the	next	slide	on	the	right,	with	your	notes	immediately	below	the	next	slide preview.	To	activate	this	view,	simply	select	the	Use	Presenter	View	option	in	the Monitors	group	on	the	Slide	Show	tab.  Figure	5-3:	Speaker	View	shows	you	your	notes	during	a	slide	show.   Chapter	6   Show	Time!

The	old	Bugs	Bunny	theme	song	 written	by	Mack	David	and	Jerry	Livingston 	strikes a	chord	when	your	presentation	is	all	finished	and	all	that	remains	is	to	present	it	to your	audience. This	chapter	shows	you	how	to	finish	the	final	preparations	by	printing	copies	of	your slides,	notes,	and	handouts.	Then	the	chapter	delves	into	the	task	of	setting	up	a projector	and	actually	presenting	your	show. This	is	it!    The	Quick	Way	to	Print  The	Print	command.	The	Printmeister.	Big	presentation	comin’	up.	Printin’	some	slides. The	Printorama.	The	Mentor	of	de	Printor.	Captain	Toner	of	the	Good	Ship	Laseroo. Don’t	worry	—	when	you	print	a	PowerPoint	presentation,	no	one’s	waiting	to	ambush you	with	annoying	one-liners	like	that	guy	who	used	to	be	on	Saturday	Night	Live.	All that	awaits	you	is	a	handful	of	boring	dialog	boxes	with	boring	check	boxes.	Point- point,	click-click,	print-print. The	fastest	way	to	print	your	presentation	is	to	click	the	Quick	Print	button,	which appears	on	the	Quick	Access	toolbar.	This	button	does	not	appear	on	your	Quick Access	toolbar	by	default.	To	add	it,	click	the	down	arrow	to	the	right	of	the	Quick Access	toolbar	and	then	click	the	Quick	Print	button. Clicking	this	Quick	Print	button	prints	your	presentation	without	further	ado,	using	the current	printer	settings,	which	I	explain	in	the	remaining	sections	of	this	chapter. Usually,	this	action	results	in	printing	a	single	copy	of	all	the	slides	in	your presentation.	But	if	you	have	altered	the	settings	on	the	Print	screen	in	Backstage	View during	the	current	PowerPoint	session,	clicking	the	Print	button	uses	the	altered settings	automatically. You	find	more	information	about	printing	from	Backstage	View	in	the	next	section.   Printing	from	Backstage	View  For	precise	control	over	how	you	want	your	presentation	to	be	printed,	you	must	switch to	Backstage	View	and	conjure	up	the	Print	screen,	shown	in	Figure	6-1.	To	summon this	screen,	choose	Office ⇒ Print	or	press	Ctrl+P.  Figure	6-1:	Behold	the	Print	screen.  	After	you	call	up	the	Print	screen,	click	the	big	Print	button	 shown	in	the margin 	or	press	Enter	to	print	all	the	slides	in	your	presentation.	Fiddle	around	with the	settings	to	print	a	select	group	of	slides,	to	print	more	than	one	copy,	or	to	print handouts,	speaker	notes,	or	an	outline.	The	following	sections	show	you	the	treasures that	lie	hidden	in	this	screen.  	Printing	can	be	es-el-oh-double-ewe,	so	don’t	panic	if	your	presentation  doesn’t	start	printing	right	away.	PowerPoint	printouts	tend	to	demand	a	great	deal from	the	printer,	so	sometimes	the	printer	has	to	work	for	a	while	before	it	can produce	a	finished	page.	Be	patient.	The	Printer	Wizard	has	every	intention	of granting	your	request.  Printing	more	than	one	copy The	Copies	field	lets	you	print	more	than	one	copy	of	your	presentation.	You	can	click one	of	the	arrows	next	to	this	field	to	increase	or	decrease	the	number	of	copies,	or	you can	type	directly	in	the	field	to	set	the	number	of	copies. Changing	printers   If	you’re	lucky	enough	to	have	two	or	more	printers	at	your	disposal,	you	can	use	the Printer	list	to	pick	which	printer	you	want	to	use.	Each	printer	must	first	be successfully	installed	in	Windows	—	a	topic	that’s	beyond	the	reach	of	this	humble book.	However,	you	can	find	plenty	of	information	about	installing	printers	in	the appropriate	version	of	Andy	Rathbone’s	Windows	For	Dummies	  Wiley . Printing	part	of	a	document The	Print	All	Slides	drop-down	list	lets	you	choose	how	much	 or	what	part 	of	your presentation	you	want	to	print.	When	you	first	access	the	Print	page	in	Backstage	view, the	Print	All	Slides	option	is	selected	so	that	your	entire	presentation	prints.	The	other options	in	this	drop-down	list	enable	you	to	tell	PowerPoint	to	print	distinct	portions	of your	presentation:  Print	Selection:	Prints	just	the	portion	of	the	presentation	that	you	selected	before invoking	the	Print	command.	First,	select	the	slides	that	you	want	to	print.	Then call	up	the	Print	command,	select	the	Selection	option,	and	click	OK.	 Note	that this	option	is	grayed	out	if	nothing	is	selected	when	you	call	up	the	Print	dialog box.  Print	Current	Slide:	Prints	just	the	current	slide.	Before	you	invoke	the	Print command,	you	should	move	to	the	slide	that	you	want	to	print.	Then	select	this option	in	the	Print	dialog	box	and	click	OK.	This	option	is	handy	when	you	make	a change	to	one	slide	and	don’t	want	to	reprint	the	entire	presentation. Custom	Range:	Lets	you	type	specific	slide	numbers	you	want	to	print. Custom	Shows:	If	you	set	up	one	or	more	custom	slide	shows,	you	can	use	this option	to	select	the	show	that	you	want	to	print.	 See	“Using	Custom	Shows,”	later in	this	chapter.   But	wait,	there’s	more!	Beneath	the	Print	All	Slides	drop-down	list	are	several	other controls:  Full	Page	Slides:	Lets	you	indicate	how	many	slides	per	page	you	want	to	print. You	can	also	use	this	same	drop-down	list	to	print	Notes	Pages	or	the	outline	rather than	slides. Collated:	This	option	tells	PowerPoint	to	print	each	copy	of	your	presentation	one at	a	time.	In	other	words,	if	your	presentation	consists	of	ten	slides	and	you	select three	copies	and	select	the	Collate	check	box,	PowerPoint	first	prints	all	ten	slides of	the	first	copy	of	the	presentation,	then	all	ten	slides	of	the	second	copy,	and	then all	ten	slides	of	the	third	copy.	If	you	don’t	select	the	Collate	check	box, PowerPoint	prints	three	copies	of	the	first	slide,	followed	by	three	copies	of	the second	slide,	followed	by	three	copies	of	the	third	slide,	and	so	on. Color:	This	drop-down	list	lets	you	choose	whether	to	print	your	slides	in	color, black	and	white,	or	with	shades	of	gray.   Using	Print	Preview The	Print	screen	of	Backstage	view	includes	a	Print	Preview	feature	that	lets	you	see how	your	pages	will	appear	before	actually	printing	them. From	the	Print	screen,	you	can	zoom	in	to	examine	the	preview	more	closely	by clicking	anywhere	in	the	preview	area.	You	can	also	scroll	through	the	pages	by	using the	scroll	bar	or	the	navigation	arrows	beneath	the	preview	area.   Setting	Up	a	Slide	Show  The	PowerPoint	printing	features	are	useful,	but	PowerPoint	is	really	designed	to	create slides	that	are	presented	directly	on	a	screen	rather	than	printed	out.	The	screen	can	be your	computer’s	own	monitor,	a	projector,	or	an	external	monitor,	such	as	a	giant- screen	television.	This	section	and	the	sections	that	follow	show	you	how	to	set	up	and show	a	presentation. In	most	cases,	the	default	settings	for	showing	a	presentation	are	adequate.	However,	in some	cases,	you	may	need	to	change	the	default	settings.	To	do	so,	first	open	the presentation	that	you	want	to	set	up	and	then	open	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon and	click	Set	Up	Slide	Show	 found	in	the	Set	Up	group .	This	action	summons	the	Set Up	Show	dialog	box,	which	is	shown	in	Figure	6-2.	With	this	dialog	box,	you	can twiddle	with	the	various	options	that	are	available	for	presenting	slide	shows.  Figure	6-2:	The	Set	Up	Show	dialog	box.  With	the	options	on	the	Set	Up	Show	dialog	box,	you	can	do	the	following:  Configure	the	presentation:	You	can	configure	the	presentation	for	one	of	three basic	slide	show	types:	Presented	by	a	Speaker	 Full	Screen ,	Browsed	by	an Individual	 Window ,	or	Browsed	at	a	Kiosk	 Full	Screen . Loop	through	slides:	Select	the	Loop	Continuously	until	‘Esc’	check	box	if	you want	the	show	to	run	indefinitely.	If	you	enable	this	setting,	the	show	jumps	back	to the	first	slide	after	the	last	slide	is	shown,	and	the	show	continues	to	repeat	until you	press	Esc. Simplify	the	presentation:	Deselect	the	Show	Without	Narration	and	Show Without	Animation	options	if	you	want	to	simplify	the	presentation	by	not	playing   narrations	that	you’ve	recorded	or	animations	that	you’ve	created. Disable	hardware	graphics	acceleration:	Use	this	option	only	if	your	computer	is having	trouble	properly	displaying	the	graphics,	media,	or	animations	in	your presentation. Select	pen	and	laser	pointer	color:	Select	the	color	to	use	for	the	pen	or	laser pointer.	 See	the	sections	“Scribbling	on	Your	Slides”	and	“Using	the	Laser Pointer,”	later	in	this	chapter,	for	more	information	about	using	the	pen	and	the laser	pointer.  Select	slides:	In	the	Show	Slides	area,	select	All	to	include	all	slides	in	the	slide show	or	choose	From	and	supply	starting	and	ending	slide	numbers	if	you	want	to display	just	some	of	the	slides	in	the	presentation. Set	up	custom	shows:	Choose	Custom	Show	if	you	have	set	up	any	custom	shows within	your	presentation.	 See	the	section	“Using	Custom	Shows,”	later	in	this chapter,	for	more	information.  Choose	to	change	slides	manually:	In	the	Advance	Slides	area,	choose	Manually to	advance	from	slide	to	slide	by	pressing	Enter,	pressing	the	spacebar,	or	clicking. Or,	if	you	want	the	show	to	proceed	automatically,	select	the	Using	Timings,	If Present	option	if	it’s	available. Select	a	monitor:	If	your	computer	has	two	monitors,	select	the	monitor	to	use	for the	slide	show	by	using	the	drop-down	list	in	the	Multiple	Monitors	area.   Starting	a	Slide	Show  	When	you	want	to	do	a	slide	show	in	a	one-on-one	or	small	group	setting	without	a  projector,	beginning	the	show	is	just	a	click	away.	To	start	a	slide	show	immediately, click	the	Slide	Show	button	located	 along	with	the	other	View	buttons 	in	the	lower- right	corner	of	the	screen	 shown	in	the	margin .	PowerPoint	fills	the	entire	screen	with the	first	slide	of	the	slide	show.	To	advance	to	the	next	slide,	click	the	mouse	button	or press	Enter,	the	down	arrow,	Page	Down,	or	the	spacebar.  	If	you’re	in	a	hurry	and	have	a	good	memory	for	keyboard	shortcuts,	just	press  F5.  You	can	also	start	a	slide	show	by	opening	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and clicking	one	of	the	following	buttons:  	From	Beginning:	Starts	the	slide	show	from	the	first	slide.	Clicking	this  button	is	the	same	as	clicking	the	Slide	Show	button	in	the	lower-right	corner	of	the screen	or	pressing	F5.  	From	Current	Slide:	Starts	the	show	from	the	currently	selected	slide.   Working	in	Presenter	View  If	you	have	a	projector	or	second	monitor	connected	to	your	computer,	PowerPoint	will show	the	presentation’s	slides	on	the	projector	or	second	monitor	and	switch	the primary	monitor	to	Presenter	View.	Figure	6-3	shows	Presenter	View	in	action.  Figure	6-3:	Presenter	View.  The	following	paragraphs	describe	the	various	features	that	are	available	in	Presenter View:  Current	slide:	The	current	slide	is	displayed	in	the	center-left	portion	of	the screen. Next	slide:	The	next	slide	to	be	displayed	is	shown	at	the	top	right	of	the	screen. Notes:	Any	notes	you	have	created	for	the	current	slide	are	shown	at	the	bottom right	of	the	screen. Timer:	A	timer	appears	above	the	current	slide	to	help	you	keep	track	of	how	long your	presentation	has	dragged	on. Tools:	Beneath	the	current	slide	are	icons	representing	various	tools	that	let	you draw	on	your	slides,	magnify	the	slide	to	draw	the	audience’s	attention	to	a particular	point,	hide	the	current	slide	so	you	can	draw	the	audience’s	attention away	from	the	screen	and	to	you,	and	perform	a	few	other	interesting	onscreen tricks.	These	tools	are	described	in	the	section	“Using	Presentation	Tools,”	later	in this	chapter. Slide	Navigator:	These	controls	let	you	advance	forward	or	backward	through   your	slide	show.   Setting	up	a	projector  If	you’re	going	to	present	your	show	by	using	a	computer	projector	and	a	laptop,	you	need	to	know	how	to	connect the	computer	to	your	laptop	as	well	as	how	to	set	up	the	projector,	turn	it	on,	focus	it,	and	so	on.	Most	of	these details	vary	from	one	projector	to	the	next,	so	you	have	to	consult	the	manual	that	came	with	the	projector	or	bribe someone	to	set	up	the	projector	for	you.	The	following	list	provides	a	few	general	tips	that	might	help:  Connecting	the	projector:	Most	laptops	have	an	external	video	port	on	the	back	or	side,	and	most projectors	have	a	video	input	connection.	Newer	projects	and	laptops	use	HDMI	connectors,	but	older projectors	or	laptops	may	use	other	types	of	connectors,	such	as	DVI	or	VGA.	Note	that	depending	on	the type	of	connector	on	your	laptop	and	on	your	projector,	you	may	need	a	special	adapter	to	match	the laptop’s	connector	to	the	projector’s	connector.	At	any	rate,	make	sure	you	have	the	correct	cable	and adapter	to	connect	your	projector	to	your	laptop. Activating	the	external	video	port:	To	use	the	laptop	with	a	projector,	you	must	first	activate	the	external video	port.	Some	laptops	automatically	detect	a	projector	when	it	is	connected.	On	others,	you	must	press	a key	or	combination	of	keys	to	activate	the	external	port. Selecting	the	projector’s	video	input:	Most	projectors	can	accept	input	from	more	than	one	source.	For example,	you	might	be	able	to	connect	a	computer	and	a	DVD	player	to	the	projector.	The	projector	should have	some	buttons	or	perhaps	a	menu	setting	that	lets	you	select	the	input	that	is	used	to	display	the projected	image.	If	you	connect	your	computer	to	the	projector	and	everything	else	seems	okay	but	you still	don’t	get	a	picture,	make	sure	that	the	projector	is	set	to	the	correct	input. Using	the	projector’s	remote	control:	If	you	want	to	use	the	projector’s	remote	control	to	operate	your presentation,	you	need	the	appropriate	cable	to	connect	the	projector	to	your	laptop’s	mouse	port	or	USB. The	correct	cable	should	come	with	the	projector. Using	sound:	If	your	presentation	has	sound,	you	need	to	connect	your	computer’s	sound	outputs	to	a	set of	amplified	speakers	or,	if	you’re	showing	the	presentation	in	a	large	auditorium,	a	PA	system.	The	correct cable	to	connect	to	a	PA	system	depends	on	the	PA	system,	but	a	cable	with	a	mini-stereo	plug	on	one	end and	a	¼-inch	plug	on	the	other	will	probably	do	the	trick.	Note	that	if	you’re	using	an	HDMI	connection, the	sound	output	will	be	supplied	to	the	projector	or	TV	via	the	HDMI	output.   Keyboard	and	Mouse	Tricks	for	Your	Slide Show  During	an	onscreen	slide	show,	you	can	use	the	keyboard	and	mouse	to	control	your presentation.	Tables	6-1	and	6-2	list	the	keys	and	clicks	that	you	can	use. Table	6-1	Keyboard	Tricks	for	Your	Slide	Show  To	Do	This  Press	Any	of	These	Keys  Display	next	slide  Enter,	spacebar,	Page	Down,	or	N  Display	preceding	slide  Backspace,	Page	Up,	or	P  Display	first	slide  1+Enter  Display	specific	slide  Slide	number+Enter  Toggle	screen	black  B	or	.	 period   Toggle	screen	white  W	or	,	 comma   Show	or	hide	pointer  A	or	=	 equal	sign   Erase	screen	doodles  E  Stop	or	restart	automatic	show  S	or	+	 plus	sign   Display	next	slide	even	if	hidden H  Display	specific	hidden	slide  Slide	number	of	hidden	slide+Enter  Change	pen	to	arrow  Change	arrow	to	pen  Ctrl+A  Ctrl+P  End	slide	show  Esc,	Ctrl+Break	 the	Break	key	doubles	as	the	Pause	key ,	or	–	 minus   Table	6-2	Mouse	Tricks	for	Your	Slide	Show  To	Do	This  Do	This  Display	next	slide  Click.  Move	through	slides  Roll	the	wheel	on	your	mouse	 if	your	mouse	has	a	wheel .  Call	up	menu	of	actions Right-click.  Display	first	slide  Hold	down	both	mouse	buttons	for	two	seconds.  Use	the	laser	pointer  Hold	down	the	Ctrl	key	and	then	hold	the	left	mouse	button	and	move	the	mouse.  Doodle  Press	Ctrl+P	to	change	the	mouse	arrow	to	a	pen	and	then	draw	onscreen	like	John	Madden.  	If	the	cursor	is	hidden,	you	can	summon	it	by	jiggling	the	mouse.	Then,	when   the	cursor	is	visible,	a	faint	menu	appears	in	the	lower-left	corner	of	the	slide.	You can	use	this	menu	to	activate	various	slide	show	features.   Using	Presentation	Tools  Presentation	View	has	several	icons	that	are	useful	during	your	presentation,	as described	in	the	following	sections. Using	the	Laser	Pointer	feature The	Laser	Pointer	feature	displays	a	bright	red	dot	on	the	screen,	which	you	can	move around	by	moving	the	mouse.	It’s	not	quite	as	good	as	using	a	real	laser	pointer,	but	if you	don’t	happen	to	have	one,	the	PowerPoint	laser	pointer	will	do.	Figure	6-4	shows the	laser	pointer	in	action.  Figure	6-4:	Using	the	laser	pointer.  	You	can	activate	the	laser	pointer	in	two	ways:  The	first	is	to	click	the	Pen	and	Laser	Pointer	button	in	Presenter	View	 shown	in the	margin 	and	then	choose	Laser	Pointer.	Then,	use	your	mouse	to	move	the	laser pointer	around	on	the	slide. The	second	way	to	activate	the	laser	pointer	is	to	hold	down	the	Ctrl	key,	then	click and	hold	the	left	mouse	button	and	move	the	mouse.	The	laser	pointer	will	appear on	the	screen	and	move	as	you	move	the	mouse.  When	you	release	the	left	mouse	button,	the	laser	pointer	disappears. Scribbling	on	your	slides You	can	doodle	on	your	slides	to	draw	your	audience’s	attention	to	a	particular	part	of the	slide.	For	example,	Figure	6-5	shows	a	slide	on	which	I’ve	drawn	two	circles	to   indicate	the	parts	of	the	Psalm	46	that	show	Shakespeare’s	name.  Figure	6-5:	Using	the	pen	tool.  	To	use	the	pen	tool	to	draw	on	a	slide,	click	the	Pen	and	Laser	Pointer	button	in Presenter	View	 shown	in	the	margin 	and	select	the	Pen	tool.	Then,	use	your	mouse	to draw	on	the	slide,	holding	down	the	left	button	and	dragging	the	mouse	around	as	best you	can	to	leave	your	mark. Here	are	some	additional	thoughts	worth	mentioning:  Instead	of	a	solid	pen,	you	can	also	use	a	transparent	highlighter.	Just	choose	the Highlighter	tool	instead	of	the	Pen	tool,	then	use	the	mouse	to	mark	on	the	slide. Note	that	the	Highlighter	tool	works	best	on	slides	that	have	a	light	background. If	you	wish,	you	can	change	the	color	of	the	marks	left	by	the	pen	tool.	Click	the Pen	and	Laser	Pointer	button,	and	then	choose	Ink	Color	and	select	the	color	you’d like	to	use. When	you	finish	your	presentation,	you	are	given	the	option	to	keep	your	doodles as	annotations	in	your	presentation.	Then,	you	won’t	have	to	redraw	the	doodles next	time. On	a	touchscreen	device,	you’ll	find	additional	buttons	in	the	bottom-left	corner	of the	presentation	to	call	up	the	laser	pointer,	pen,	highlighter,	and	so	on.   Rehearsing	Your	Slide	Timings  You	can	use	the	PowerPoint	Rehearsal	feature	to	rehearse	your	presentation.	The Rehearsal	feature	lets	you	know	how	long	your	presentation	takes,	and	it	can	even	set slide	timings	so	that	the	slides	automatically	advance	based	on	the	timings	you	set during	the	rehearsal. To	rehearse	a	slide	show,	click	the	Rehearse	Timings	button	in	the	Set	Up	section	of	the Slide	Show	Ribbon	tab.	This	starts	the	slide	show,	with	a	special	Recording	dialog	box visible,	as	shown	in	Figure	6-6.  Figure	6-6:	Rehearsing	a	slide	show.  Now	rehearse	your	presentation.	Click	or	use	keyboard	shortcuts	to	advance	slides.	As you	rehearse,	the	Rehearse	dialog	box	keeps	track	of	how	long	you	display	each	slide and	the	total	length	of	your	presentation. When	you	end	the	presentation,	PowerPoint	displays	a	dialog	box	that	gives	you	the option	of	applying	or	ignoring	the	timings	recorded	during	the	rehearsal	to	the	slides	in the	presentation.	If	you	were	satisfied	with	the	slide	timings	during	the	rehearsal,	click Yes. If	you	mess	up	during	a	rehearsal,	click	the	Repeat	button.	Clicking	this	button	restarts the	rehearsal	from	the	beginning.   Using	Custom	Shows  The	Custom	Shows	feature	in	PowerPoint	lets	you	create	several	similar	slide	shows stored	in	a	single	presentation	file.	For	example,	suppose	that	you’re	asked	to	give presentations	about	company	benefits	to	management	and	non-management	staff.	You can	create	a	presentation	containing	slides	for	all	the	company	benefits	and	then	create a	custom	show	containing	only	those	slides	describing	benefits	that	are	available	to non-management	staff.	 This	custom	slide	show	can	leave	out	slides	such	as	“Executive Washrooms,”	“Golf	Days,”	and	“Boondoggles.” 	You	may	then	show	the	complete presentation	to	management	but	show	the	custom	show	to	non-management	staff. A	presentation	can	contain	as	many	custom	shows	as	you	want.	Each	custom	show	is simply	a	subset	of	the	complete	presentation	—	comprised	of	selected	slides	from	the complete	presentation. Creating	a	custom	show To	create	a	custom	show,	follow	these	steps:  1.	  	On	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	Custom	Slide	Show   located	in	the	Start	Slide	Show	group 	and	then	choose	Custom	Shows	from the	menu	that	appears. This	displays	the	Custom	Shows	dialog	box.  2.	 Click	the	New	button.  The	Define	Custom	Show	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	6-7.  3.	 Type	a	name	for	the	custom	show	in	the	Slide	Show	Name	field. 4.	 Add	the	slides	that	you	want	to	appear	in	the	custom	slide	show.  All	the	slides	available	in	the	presentation	are	listed	in	the	list	box	on	the	left	side of	the	Define	Custom	Show	dialog	box.	To	add	a	slide	to	the	custom	show,	select the	slide	that	you	want	to	add	and	then	click	Add.	The	slide	appears	in	the	list	box on	the	right	side	of	the	Define	Custom	Show	dialog	box.  	You	don’t	have	to	add	slides	to	the	custom	show	in	the	same	order	that	the  slides	appear	in	the	original	presentation.	Slides	for	a	custom	show	can	appear	in any	order	you	want.	You	can	also	include	a	slide	from	the	original	presentation more	than	once	in	a	custom	show. To	remove	a	slide	that	you’ve	added	by	mistake,	deselect	the	slide	that	you	want	to remove	in	the	list	box	on	the	right	side	of	the	Define	Custom	Show	dialog	box,	and then	click	Remove.   You	can	use	the	up	and	down	arrows	near	the	right	edge	of	the	Define	Custom Show	dialog	box	to	change	the	order	of	the	slides	in	the	custom	show.  5.	 Click	OK.  You	return	to	the	Custom	Shows	dialog	box.  6.	 Click	Close	to	dismiss	the	Custom	Shows	dialog	box.  Figure	6-7:	Defining	a	custom	show.  Showing	a	custom	show To	show	a	custom	show,	first	open	the	presentation	that	contains	the	custom	show. Then	open	the	Slide	Show	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Custom	Slide	Show	button,	then choose	Custom	Shows	from	the	menu	that	appears.	This	displays	the	Custom	Shows dialog	box,	which	lists	any	custom	shows	in	the	presentation.	You	can	then	select	the custom	show	you	want	and	start	the	show	by	clicking	the	Show	button. Hiding	slides  	If	you	don’t	want	to	go	to	all	the	trouble	of	creating	a	custom	show,	but	you	want to	exclude	a	few	slides	from	a	presentation,	you	don’t	have	to	delete	the	slides.	Instead, you	can	hide	them.	To	hide	a	slide,	select	the	slide	and	then	click	Hide	Slide	in	the Slide	Show	Ribbon	tab.	To	unhide	a	slide,	select	the	slide	and	click	the	button	again.  You	can	determine	which	slides	have	been	hidden	by	looking	at	the	slide	in	the	Slides tab	on	the	left.	If	the	slide	number	has	a	slash	through	it,	the	slide	is	hidden.    Showing	Your	Presentation	Online  PowerPoint	2016	includes	a	new	online	presentation	feature	that	makes	it	ridiculously easy	to	share	your	presentation	with	other	people	remotely	over	the	Internet.	To	use	it, simply	follow	these	steps:  1.	  	Click	the	Present	Online	button	in	the	Slide	Show	Ribbon	tab	 shown	in  the	margin . Doing	this	brings	up	the	Present	Online	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	6-8.  2.	 Click	Connect. 3.	 If	prompted,	enter	your	Windows	Live	username	and	password.  If	you	don’t	have	a	Windows	Live	account,	sign	up	for	one	at http:  signup.live.com. After	you	are	connected,	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	6-9	is	shown.  4.	 To	send	an	email	to	your	meeting	participants,	click	Send	in	Email.	Next,  complete	the	email	by	adding	recipients	and	any	other	text	you	wish	to	add and	send	the	email. Your	participants	can	then	click	the	link	to	open	the	presentation	in	their	web browsers. You	can	also	click	Copy	Link	to	copy	the	presentation	link	to	the	clipboard.	You can	then	paste	the	link	into	an	email	to	distribute	to	your	meeting	participants. 5.	 When	everyone	is	ready	to	view	the	presentation,	click	Start	Presentation.  This	starts	the	presentation.	Your	participants	can	follow	the	presentation	in	their web	browsers,	as	shown	in	Figure	6-10.   Figure	6-8:	Showing	a	presentation	online.  Figure	6-9:	Sharing	the	presentation	address.

If	you	use	PowerPoint	templates	as	the	basis	for	your	presentations,	your text	is	already	formatted	acceptably.	To	really	pull	out	the	pyrotechnic	stops,	however, you	have	to	know	a	few	basic	formatting	tricks. Many	PowerPoint	text-formatting	capabilities	work	the	same	as	in	Microsoft	Word.	If you	want	to	format	text	a	certain	way	and	you	know	how	to	do	it	in	Word,	try formatting	the	same	way	in	PowerPoint.	Odds	are	good	that	it	works.    Changing	the	Look	of	Your	Text  The	theme	that’s	applied	to	your	presentation	determines	the	basic	look	of	the presentation’s	text.	However,	you’ll	often	want	to	change	that	look,	sometimes	subtly and	sometimes	dramatically. You	can	control	the	most	commonly	used	font	settings	by	using	the	Font	group	in	the Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	as	shown	in	Figure	7-1.  Figure	7-1:	The	Font	group	on	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon.  If	the	Font	group	in	the	Home	tab	doesn’t	provide	enough	options	for	formatting	your text,	you	can	call	up	the	Font	dialog	box	for	additional	options.	To	summon	this	dialog box,	just	select	the	dialog	launcher	for	the	Font	group.	 The	dialog	launcher	is	the cursor	at	the	bottom-right	corner	of	the	group. 	Figure	7-2	shows	this	dialog	box.  Figure	7-2:	The	Font	dialog	box.  Many	font	formatting	options	also	have	handy	keyboard	shortcuts.	Table	7-1	lists	the formatting	commands	along	with	their	Ribbon	buttons	and	equivalent	keyboard shortcuts. Table	7-1	Character-Formatting	Commands  Button  Keyboard	Shortcut Formatting	Command   none    none   Font  Size   Ctrl+Shift+>  Increase	font	size  Ctrl+Shift+<  Decrease	font	size  Ctrl+spacebar  Clear	all	formatting  Ctrl+B  Ctrl+I  Ctrl+U   none    none    none   Bold  Italic  Underline  Text	shadow  Strikethrough  Character	spacing  Shift+F3  Change	case   none   Font	color  It’s	true	—	PowerPoint	has	many	keyboard	shortcuts	for	character	formatting.	You don’t	have	to	know	them	all,	though.	The	only	ones	I	know	and	use	routinely	are	the shortcuts	for	bold,	italic,	underline,	and	clear	all	formatting.	Study	these	and	you’ll	be in	good	shape.	You	get	the	added	bonus	that	these	keyboard	shortcuts	are	the	same	as the	shortcuts	that	many	other	Windows	programs	use.	If	you’re	mouse-happy	and keyboard-annoyed,	click	away	for	goodness’	sake.	What	matters	most	is	that	you	can easily	find	and	use	what	you	need. Two	ways	to	apply	formatting You	can	format	text	in	two	basic	ways:  To	format	existing	text,	highlight	the	text	that	you	want	to	format.	Then,	click	the toolbar	button	or	use	the	keyboard	shortcut	for	the	format	that	you	want.	For example,	to	make	existing	text	bold,	highlight	it	and	then	click	the	Bold	button	or press	Ctrl+B. To	type	new	text	using	a	fancy	format,	click	the	toolbar	button	or	use	the keyboard	shortcut	for	the	format.	Then,	type	away.	The	text	that	you	type	is	given the	format	you	selected.	To	return	to	normal	formatting,	click	the	button	or	use	the keyboard	shortcut	again.	Or	press	Ctrl+spacebar. Changing	the	size	of	characters Whether	text	is	difficult	to	read	or	you	simply	want	to	draw	attention	to	it,	you	can make	part	of	the	text	bigger	than	the	surrounding	text.	The	easiest	way	to	change	the size	of	your	text	is	to	use	the	Font	Size	drop-down	list	that	appears	next	to	the	font name	in	the	Font	group	on	the	Home	tab.	Just	choose	among	the	sizes	that	appear	in	the   Font	Size	drop-down	list	or	click	in	the	Font	Size	box	and	type	whatever	size	you	want to	use. You	can	also	change	the	size	of	your	text	by	using	the	Increase	Font	Size	or	Decrease Font	Size	buttons,	or	by	using	the	Ctrl+Shift+>	or	Ctrl+Shift+<	keyboard	shortcuts. These	commands	increase	or	decrease	the	font	size	in	steps,	respectively.  	If	you	type	more	text	than	will	fit	in	a	text	placeholder,	PowerPoint	will  automatically	make	your	text	smaller	so	that	the	text	will	fit	within	the placeholder.  Choosing	text	fonts If	you	don’t	like	the	looks	of	a	text	font,	you	can	switch	easily	to	a	different	font.	To change	the	font	for	existing	text,	select	the	text.	Then	click	the	arrow	next	to	the	Font control	 found	in	the	Font	group	of	the	Home	tab 	and	choose	the	font	that	you	want	to use.	If	you’re	allergic	to	the	mouse,	you	can	get	to	the	font	list	by	pressing Ctrl+Shift+F.	Then	you	can	use	the	up-	or	down-arrow	keys	to	choose	the	font	you want	to	use. Here	are	additional	points	to	ponder	concerning	fonts:  Although	you	can	change	the	font	from	the	Font	dialog	box,	the	Font	control	on	the Ribbon	has	one	major	advantage	over	the	Font	dialog	box:	It	displays	each	of	your fonts	by	using	the	font	itself,	so	you	can	see	what	each	font	looks	like	before	you apply	it	to	your	text.	In	contrast,	the	Font	dialog	box	displays	the	name	of	each	font by	using	the	standard	Windows	system	font. If	you	want	to	change	the	font	for	all	the	slides	in	your	presentation,	switch	to	Slide Master	View	and	then	change	the	font.	Details	on	how	to	do	so	are	covered	in Chapter	10. PowerPoint	automatically	moves	the	fonts	that	you	use	the	most	to	the	head	of	the font	list.	This	feature	makes	picking	your	favorite	font	even	easier. Don’t	overdo	it	with	fonts!	Just	because	you	have	many	different	font	choices doesn’t	mean	that	you	should	try	to	use	them	all	on	the	same	slide.	Don’t	mix	more than	two	or	three	typefaces	on	a	slide,	and	use	fonts	consistently	throughout	the presentation. If	you	want	to	set	a	font	that	is	used	consistently	throughout	a	presentation,	the	best way	to	do	so	is	to	set	the	font	for	the	presentation’s	theme.	For	more	information, see	Chapter	8.  Adding	color	to	your	text Color	is	an	excellent	way	to	draw	attention	to	text	in	a	slide.	To	change	text	color,	first   select	the	text	whose	color	you	want	to	change.	Then	click	the	Font	Color	button	and choose	the	color	that	you	want	to	use	from	the	color	menu	that	appears.  	If	you	don’t	like	any	color	that	the	Font	Color	button	offers,	click	More	Colors.  A	bigger	dialog	box	with	more	color	choices	appears.	If	you	still	can’t	find	the	right shade	of	teal,	click	the	Custom	tab	and	have	at	it.	Check	out	Chapters	8	and	9	if	you need	further	help	with	colors. If	you	want	to	change	the	text	color	for	your	entire	presentation,	do	so	in	the	Slide Master	View	 see	Chapter	10	for	details .	And	you	can	refer	to	Chapter	8	for information	about	changing	font	colors	by	using	the	theme. Adding	shadows Adding	a	shadow	behind	your	text	can	make	the	text	stand	out	against	its	background, which	makes	the	entire	slide	easier	to	read.	For	that	reason,	many	of	the	templates supplied	with	PowerPoint	use	shadows.  	You	can	apply	a	shadow	to	any	text	by	first	selecting	the	text	and	then	clicking	the  Text	Shadow	button,	found	in	the	Font	section	of	the	Home	tab.	If	you	want	all	the	text on	a	slide	to	be	shadowed,	however,	you	should	use	the	Slide	Master	View	to	create	the shadow	format.	For	more	information,	peek	ahead	to	Chapter	10.   Big	Picture	Text	Formatting  The	Paragraph	group	on	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	as	shown	in	Figure	7-3,	has several	buttons	that	apply	formats	to	entire	paragraphs.	The	following	sections	describe the	most	common	uses	for	the	buttons	in	this	group.  Figure	7-3:	The	Paragraph	group	on	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon.  Biting	the	bulleted	list Most	presentations	have	at	least	some	slides	that	include	a	bulleted	list,	which	is	a series	of	paragraphs	accented	by	special	characters	lovingly	known	as	bullets.	In	the old	days,	you	had	to	add	bullets	one	at	a	time.	Nowadays,	PowerPoint	comes	with	a semi-automatic	bullet	shooter	that	is	illegal	in	27	states.  	PowerPoint	lets	you	create	fancy	bullets	that	are	based	on	bitmap	pictures  rather	than	simple	dots	and	check	marks.	Before	you	go	crazy	with	picture	bullets,	take a	look	at	the	basic	way	to	bite	the	bullet. To	add	bullets	to	a	paragraph	or	series	of	paragraphs,	take	aim	and	fire,	like	so:  1.	 Highlight	the	paragraphs	to	which	you	want	to	add	bullets.  To	add	a	bullet	to	just	one	paragraph,	you	don’t	have	to	highlight	the	entire paragraph.	Just	place	the	cursor	anywhere	in	the	paragraph.  2.	 Click	the	Bullets	button	found	in	the	Paragraph	group	of	the	Home	tab.  PowerPoint	adds	a	bullet	to	each	paragraph	that	you	select.  The	Bullets	button	works	like	a	toggle:	Press	it	once	to	add	bullets	and	press	it	again	to remove	bullets.	To	remove	bullets	from	previously	bulleted	text,	therefore,	you	select the	text	and	click	the	Bullets	button	again. If	you	don’t	like	the	appearance	of	the	bullets	that	PowerPoint	uses,	you	can	select	a different	bullet	character,	picture,	or	even	a	motion	clip	by	clicking	the	down	arrow	at the	right	side	of	the	Bullets	button.	This	action	reveals	a	list	of	choices	for	various types	of	bullets. If	none	of	the	bullets	in	this	list	are	acceptable,	you	can	bring	up	the	Bullets	and Numbering	dialog	box	by	clicking	the	arrow	at	the	right	of	the	Bullets	button	and	then choosing	Bullets	and	Numbers.	This	step	summons	the	Bullets	and	Numbering	dialog box,	as	shown	in	Figure	7-4.	From	this	dialog	box,	you	can	choose	a	different	bullet   character,	change	the	bullet’s	color,	or	change	its	size	relative	to	the	text	size.  Figure	7-4:	The	Bullets	and	Numbering	dialog	box.  The	following	paragraphs	point	out	some	important	tidbits	to	keep	in	mind	when	you use	bullets:  Customize	bullet	characters:	You	can	choose	from	among	several	collections	of bullet	characters	that	are	available.	If	you	don’t	like	any	of	the	bullet	characters displayed	for	you	in	the	dialog	box,	click	Customize	in	the	lower-right	corner	of	the dialog	box.	This	brings	up	a	dialog	box	that	lists	a	variety	of	useful	alternative bullet	characters,	such	as	pointing	fingers,	a	skull	and	crossbones,	and	a	time	bomb. Pick	the	bullet	that	you	want	to	use	and	then	click	OK.	If	you	can’t	find	a	bullet	that suits	your	fancy,	choose	a	different	font	in	the	Font	control	drop-down	list.  	Change	the	size	of	bullet	characters:	If	the	bullet	characters	don’t	seem  large	enough,	increase	the	size	in	the	Bullets	and	Numbering	dialog	box.	The	size	is specified	as	a	percentage	of	the	text	size. Change	the	color	of	bullet	characters:	To	change	the	bullet	color,	use	the	Color drop-down	list	to	choose	the	color	that	you	want	to	use.	Colors	from	the	current color	scheme	appear	in	the	drop-down	menu	that	appears.	For	additional	color choices,	choose	More	Colors	to	call	up	a	dialog	box	that	offers	a	complete	range	of color	choices.	 For	more	information	about	using	colors,	see	Chapter	8.  Use	images	for	your	bullet	characters:	To	use	a	picture	bullet,	click	the	Picture button	located	in	the	lower	right	of	the	Bullets	and	Numbering	dialog	box.	This click	brings	up	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	7-5,	which	lets	you	choose	from several	sources	for	a	picture	to	use	as	a	bullet.   Figure	7-5:	Using	a	picture	bullet.  Creating	numbered	lists If	you	want	your	slide	to	include	a	numbered	list,	use	the	Numbering	button,	which appears	next	to	the	Bullets	button	on	the	Home	tab.	When	you	click	the	Numbering button,	PowerPoint	adds	simple	numbers	to	the	selected	paragraphs. If	you	want	to	change	the	numbering	format,	click	the	arrow	next	to	the	Numbering button	to	display	a	list	of	number	style	choices.	Then	you	can	select	the	style	that	suits your	fancy. If	none	of	the	styles	in	the	list	are	right,	choose	Bullets	and	Numbering	to	reveal	the numbering	options	shown	on	the	Numbered	tab	of	the	Bullets	and	Numbering	dialog box.	See	Figure	7-6.   Figure	7-6:	More	ways	to	format	numbers.  	Normally,	the	starting	number	for	each	list	reverts	to	1	for	each	new	slide. What	if	you	have	a	list	that	has	more	items	than	can	fit	on	one	slide,	such	as	a David	Letterman-style	Top	Ten	list?	In	that	case,	you	can	type	the	first	half	of	the list	on	one	slide	and	then	type	the	second	half	of	the	list	on	a	second	slide.	Next, right-click	the	first	item	on	the	second	slide	and	choose	Bullets	and	Numbering from	the	menu	that	appears.	Then,	change	the	Start	At	value	to	the	number	at which	you	want	the	second	part	of	the	list	to	begin.	For	example,	if	the	first	slide has	five	numbered	items,	change	the	Start	At	value	for	the	first	item	on	the	second slide	to	6.  Setting	tabs	and	indents PowerPoint	enables	you	to	set	tab	stops	to	control	the	placement	of	text	within	a	text object.	For	most	presentations,	you	don’t	have	to	fuss	with	tabs.	Each	paragraph	is indented	according	to	its	level	in	the	outline,	and	the	template	that	you	use	to	create	the presentation	presets	the	amount	of	indentation	for	each	outline	level. If	you’re	stubborn	about	tabs,	you	can	mess	with	the	indent	settings	and	tab	stops	— that	is,	if	you’re	adventurous	and	have	no	real	work	to	do	today.	Here’s	how	you	do	it:  1.	 Click	the	Slide	button	to	switch	to	Normal	View.  You	can’t	mess	with	tabs	or	indents	in	Notes	Page	View	or	Slide	Sorter	View. 2.	 If	the	rulers	aren’t	visible,	summon	them	by	clicking	the	View	tab	on	the Ribbon	and	then	selecting	the	Ruler	check	box	in	the	Show Hide	group. Rulers	appear	above	and	to	the	left	of	the	presentation	window	and	show	the current	tab	and	indentation	settings.  3.	 Select	the	text	object	whose	tabs	or	indents	you	want	to	change.  Each	text	object	has	its	own	tabs	and	indents	settings.	After	you	click	a	text	object, the	ruler	shows	that	object’s	tabs	and	indents.  4.	 Click	the	ruler	to	add	a	tab	stop.  Move	the	cursor	to	the	ruler	location	where	you	want	to	add	a	tab	stop	and	then click.	A	tab	stop	appears.  5.	 Grab	the	indentation	doohickey	and	then	drag	it	to	change	the	indentation.  The	indentation	doohickey	 that’s	not	its	official	name 	is	the	control	that	looks	like an	hourglass	sitting	on	a	little	box,	normally	positioned	at	the	left	side	of	the	ruler. It	actually	consists	of	three	parts:	The	top	upside-down	triangle	sets	the	indentation for	the	first	line	of	the	paragraph,	the	middle	triangle	sets	the	indentation	for	the remaining	lines	of	the	paragraph,	and	the	box	at	the	bottom	sets	the	indentation	for the	paragraph.	Try	dragging	the	different	parts	of	the	indentation	doohickey	to	see   what	happens.	Have	fun.	Good	luck.   Don’t	even	bother	with	this	stuff	about	tab	types PowerPoint	isn’t	limited	to	just	boring	left-aligned	tabs.	In	all,	it	has	four	distinct	types	of	tabs:	left,	right,	center, and	decimal.	The	square	button	that	appears	at	the	far-left	side	of	the	ruler	when	you	select	text	tells	you	which	type of	tab	is	added	when	you	click	the	ruler.	Click	this	button	to	cycle	through	the	four	types	of	tabs:  Standard	left-aligned	tab:	Press	Tab	to	advance	the	text	to	the	tab	stop. Right-aligned	tab:	Text	is	aligned	flush	right	with	the	tab	stop. Centered	tab:	Text	lines	up	centered	over	the	tab	stop. Decimal	tab:	Numbers	line	up	with	the	decimal	point	centered	over	the	tab	stop.  Each	text	object	is	initially	set	up	with	default	tab	stops	set	at	every	inch.	When	you add	a	tab	stop,	any	default	tab	stops	located	to	the	left	of	the	new	tab	stop	disappear.  	To	remove	a	tab	stop,	use	the	mouse	to	drag	the	tab	stop	off	the	ruler.	 For  instance,	click	the	tab	stop,	drag	it	off	the	ruler,	and	then	release	the	mouse button.   Spacing	out Feeling	a	little	spaced	out?	Try	tightening	the	space	between	text	lines.	Feeling cramped?	Space	out	the	lines	a	little.	These	steps	show	you	how	to	do	it	all:  1.	 Highlight	the	paragraph	—	or	paragraphs	—	whose	line	spacing	you	want	to  change.  2.	 Click	the	Line	Spacing	button	and	then	select	the	amount	of	line	spacing	you  want. The	Line	Spacing	button	displays	the	most	common	line	spacing	options:	1.0,	1.5, 2.0,	2.5,	and	3.0.	If	you	want	to	set	the	line	spacing	to	a	value	that’s	not	shown	on the	Line	Spacing	button,	select	Line	Spacing	Options	to	display	the	Paragraph dialog	box,	as	shown	in	Figure	7-7.   Figure	7-7:	Change	the	line	spacing.  Lining	things	up PowerPoint	enables	you	to	control	the	way	your	text	lines	up	on	the	slide.	You	can center	text,	line	it	up	flush	left	or	flush	right,	or	justify	it.	You	can	change	these alignments	by	using	the	alignment	buttons	in	the	Paragraph	group	on	the	Home	tab. You	can	also	use	the	keyboard	shortcuts	described	in	Table	7-2. Table	7-2	Paragraph	Alignment	Commands  Button Keyboard	Shortcut Alignment  Ctrl+L  Ctrl+E  Ctrl+R  Ctrl+J  Align	Left  Center  Align	Right  Justify  Here	are	some	semirandom	thoughts	on	aligning	paragraphs:  Centered	text	lines	up	right	down	the	middle	of	the	slide.	Actually,	text	lines	up down	the	middle	of	the	text	object	that	contains	the	text;	a	text	line	appears centered	on	the	slide	only	if	the	text	object	is	centered	on	the	slide. Bulleted	lists	look	best	when	left-aligned.	Otherwise,	the	bullets	don’t	line	up.  Making	columns  	Most	slides	place	all	their	text	in	a	single	column.	However,	you	can	easily	create multiple	columns	by	using	the	Columns	button,	found	in	the	Paragraph	section	of	the Home	tab.	To	create	a	one-,	two-,	or	three-column	layout,	just	click	the	Columns	button and	then	choose	one,	two,	or	three	columns	from	the	menu	that	appears.	If	you	want   more	than	three	columns,	select	the	More	Columns	command	and	then	choose	the number	of	columns	you	want	to	use.   Creating	Fancy	Text	with	WordArt  Previous	versions	of	PowerPoint	included	a	feature	called	WordArt	that	let	you	insert special	objects	that	could	incorporate	fancy	text	effects,	such	as	gradient	fills	or	curved paths.	For	PowerPoint	2016,	Microsoft	has	integrated	WordArt	into	PowerPoint,	so	that you	can	apply	WordArt	formatting	to	any	bit	of	text	in	your	presentation	just	by highlighting	the	text	and	applying	the	WordArt	formats.	Figure	7-8	is	an	example	of what	you	can	do	with	WordArt	in	just	a	couple	of	minutes.  Figure	7-8:	You,	too,	can	create	fancy	text	effects	like	this	using	WordArt.  Follow	these	steps	to	transform	mundane	text	into	something	worth	looking	at:  1.	 Select	the	text	you	want	to	apply	WordArt	formatting	to.  The	text	can	be	anywhere	in	your	presentation.	For	example,	you	can	apply WordArt	formatting	to	a	slide	title	or	body	text.  2.	 Click	the	Drawing	Tools	Format	tab.  The	Drawing	Tools	Format	tab	includes	a	WordArt	Styles	group,	shown	in	Figure 7-9.	As	you	can	see,	this	Ribbon	group	includes	several	pre-configured	WordArt styles	as	well	as	buttons	that	let	you	control	the	text	fill,	outline	style,	and	text effects	such	as	shadows	and	glowing.  3.	 Click	the	More	button	found	at	the	bottom	of	the	scroll	bar	to	the	right	of	the  predefined	WordArt	styles. The	WordArt	Quick	Styles	gallery	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	7-10.  4.	 Select	the	WordArt	style	that	most	closely	resembles	the	formatting	you	want  to	apply. Don’t	worry	if	none	of	the	gallery	choices	exactly	match	the	effect	you	want;	you can	tweak	the	text’s	appearance	later.   5.	 Fool	around	with	other	WordArt	controls	in	the	WordArt	Styles	group	of	the  Drawing	Tools	Format	tab. Table	7-3	describes	the	other	controls	in	the	WordArt	Styles	group.	Experiment with	these	controls	as	much	as	you	want	until	you	get	the	text	to	look	just	right.  Figure	7-9:	The	WordArt	Styles	group	on	the	Drawing	Tools	Format	tab.  Figure	7-10:	The	WordArt	Quick	Styles	gallery.  Table	7-3	Buttons	on	the	WordArt	Drawing	Tools	Format	Tab  Control  What	It	Does  What	It’s Called  Text	Fill  Sets	the	fill	color.	The	fill	can	be	a	simple	color,	a	gradient	 which	blends	two	or	more	colors ,	a picture,	a	pattern,	or	a	texture.  Text	Outline Sets	the	properties	of	the	text	outline.	You	can	select	a	color,	a	pattern,	and	a	thickness.  Text	Effects Lets	you	apply	fancy	text	effects	such	as	shadows,	reflections,	glowing	text,	beveled	text,	3-D  rotations,	and	transforms.  	The	Text	Effects	button	is	the	key	to	creating	fancy	logos,	such	as	text	that wraps	around	circles	or	text	that	has	a	three-dimensional	look.	When	you	click this	button,	a	menu	with	various	text	formatting	options	appears.	Table	7-4	lists the	formatting	options	available	on	this	menu.  Table	7-4	Formatting	Options	on	the	Text	Effects	Menu  Control What	It’s  Called  What	It	Does   Shadow  Adds	a	shadow	to	the	text.	The	shadow	can	be	directly	behind	the	text,	or	it	can	appear	beneath	the	text,	which creates	the	impression	that	the	text	is	floating	above	an	invisible	surface.  Reflection Creates	a	faint	reflection	on	an	invisible	surface	beneath	the	text.  Glow  Adds	a	glowing	effect	to	the	text.  Bevel  Adds	a	beveled	effect	to	the	text,	which	creates	the	impression	that	the	text	has	been	chiseled	from	a	solid object.  3-D Rotation Rotates	the	text	around	three	dimensions.  Transform Transforms	the	overall	shape	of	the	text.   Chapter	8   Designing	Your	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Understanding	how	to	use	themes 	Using	theme	colors,	fonts,	and	effects 	Playing	with	the	background  One	of	the	most	bothersome	tasks	of	putting	together	a	good	PowerPoint	presentation is	making	the	presentation	look	good.	Always	wanting	to	be	helpful	in	such	matters, Microsoft	has	endowed	PowerPoint	with	a	feature	called	themes	that	lets	you	create good-looking	slides	in	minutes.	One	of	the	best	features	of	themes	is	that	they	work	not only	in	PowerPoint,	but	also	in	Word	and	Excel.	Thus,	you	can	use	themes	to	create PowerPoint	presentations,	Word	documents,	and	Excel	spreadsheets	that	have	a consistent	appearance. The	main	access	to	PowerPoint	themes	is	from	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	This entire	chapter	is	devoted	to	this	Design	tab.	To	keep	things	simple,	I	approach	this	most useful	tab	from	left	to	right	even	though	that’s	not	always	the	order	in	which	you	use the	controls	it	contains.   Looking	at	the	Design	Tab  To	get	things	started,	Figure	8-1	shows	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	As	you	can	see, the	Design	tab	contains	several	groups	of	controls	that	let	you	set	various	aspects	of	the slide	design	used	within	your	presentation.	You	can	summon	the	Design	tab	by	clicking it	on	the	Ribbon	or	by	using	the	handy	keyboard	shortcut	Alt+G.  Figure	8-1:	The	Design	tab.  The	following	list	describes	the	general	purpose	of	each	group	of	controls	on	the Design	tab:  Themes:	Lets	you	apply	a	theme	to	the	presentation.	This	is	the	group	you	work with	most	while	you	play	with	the	design	of	your	slides. Variants:	Lets	you	choose	from	several	minor	variants	of	a	given	theme. Customize:	Lets	you	change	the	slide	size	and	background	appearance.   Working	with	Themes  The	Themes	group	of	the	Design	tab	lets	you	select	a	theme	to	apply	to	your	slides. PowerPoint	2016	comes	with	a	ton	of	carefully	crafted	themes	that	give	a	professional look	to	your	presentations.	If	you’re	somewhat	artsy,	you	can	design	your	own	themes, as	well. A	theme	is	a	set	of	design	elements	that	are	applied	to	one	or	more	slides	in	a presentation.	Each	theme	includes	several	basic	components:  A	set	of	colors	that	work	well	together.	Each	theme	has	four	colors	that	can	be	used for	text	or	backgrounds	and	six	colors	that	can	be	used	for	accents. A	set	of	fonts	that	looks	good	when	used	together.	Each	theme	has	a	font	used	for headings	and	a	font	used	for	regular	text. A	set	of	background	styles,	which	are	a	combination	of	background	colors	and effects	such	as	patterns	or	gradient	fills. A	set	of	design	effects,	such	as	line	and	fill	styles	and	line	styles.  Office	ships	with	21	predefined	themes.	These	themes	are	named	as	follows:  Office	Theme Facet Integral Ion Ion	Boardroom Organic Retrospect Slice Wisp Banded Basis Celestial Dividend Frame Mesh Metropolitan Parallax Quotable   Savon View Wood	Type  Each	of	these	21	themes	is	available	in	for	color	variations,	which	yields	a	total	of	84 distinct	theme	variants	you	can	apply	to	your	slides. Applying	themes To	apply	a	theme	to	an	entire	presentation,	simply	click	the	theme	you	want	to	apply	in the	Themes	group	on	the	Design	tab.	If	the	theme	you	want	to	apply	isn’t	visible,	use the	scroll	buttons	on	the	right	side	of	the	Themes	group	to	display	additional	themes. When	you	have	selected	a	theme	in	the	Themes	group,	variations	on	the	theme	will appear	in	the	Variants	group.	You	can	then	click	on	one	of	the	variants	you	want	to	use.  	To	see	a	preview	of	how	your	presentation	will	appear	with	a	particular	theme, hover	the	mouse	over	that	theme	in	the	gallery.	After	a	moment,	the	current	slide momentarily	appears	formatted	with	the	theme.	If	you	move	the	mouse	off	the theme	without	actually	clicking	the	theme,	the	current	slide	reverts	to	its	previous formatting.  	You	can	click	the	down	arrow	in	the	scroll	bars	in	the	Theme	gallery,	which  displays	an	expanded	list	of	themes,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-2.	As	you	can	see,	this window	displays	PowerPoint’s	built-in	themes	and	also	includes	links	that	let	you browse	for	additional	themes.	A	link	even	lets	you	save	the	current	combination	of theme	elements	as	a	new	theme.  Figure	8-2:	The	Theme	gallery.  	Not	all	the	slides	in	a	presentation	have	to	follow	the	same	theme.	To	apply	a   theme	to	a	single	slide	—	or	a	set	of	slides	—	select	the	slide s .	Then,	right-click the	theme	you	want	to	apply	and	choose	Apply	to	Selected	Slides.  Using	theme	colors Each	PowerPoint	theme	includes	a	built-in	color	scheme,	which	consists	of	sets	of colors	chosen	by	color	professionals.	Microsoft	paid	these	people	enormous	sums	of money	to	debate	the	merits	of	using	mauve	text	on	a	teal	background.	You	can	use these	professionally	designed	color	schemes,	or	you	can	create	your	own	if	you	think that	you	have	a	better	eye	than	the	Microsoft-hired	color	guns. As	far	as	I’m	concerned,	the	color	schemes	in	PowerPoint	themes	are	the	best	things	to come	along	since	Peanut	M&Ms.	Without	color	schemes,	people	like	me	are	free	to pick	and	choose	from	among	the	16	million	or	so	colors	that	PowerPoint	lets	you incorporate	into	your	slides.	The	resulting	slides	can	easily	appear	next	to	Cher	and Lindsay	Lohan	in	People	magazine’s	annual	“Worst	Dressed	of	the	Year”	issue. Each	color	scheme	has	12	colors,	with	each	color	designated	for	a	particular	use,	as shown	in	this	list:  Four	Text Background	colors:	These	four	colors	are	designed	to	be	the	primary colors	for	the	presentation.	One	from	each	pair	is	used	for	text,	and	the	other	for	the background.	 You	could	use	the	same	color	for	both,	but	that	would	make	the	slides impossible	to	read!  Six	accent	colors:	These	colors	are	used	for	various	bits	and	pieces	of	your	slides that	complement	the	basic	text	and	background	colors. Two	hyperlink	colors:	These	colors	are	used	only	when	your	presentation	includes hyperlinks.  When	you	apply	a	theme,	the	color	scheme	for	that	theme	is	applied	along	with	the other	elements	of	the	theme.	However,	PowerPoint	lets	you	change	the	color	scheme from	the	scheme	that	comes	with	the	theme.	For	example,	you	can	apply	a	theme	such as	Opulent	but	then	change	the	color	scheme	to	the	scheme	from	the	Verve	theme. Applying	a	color	scheme To	change	the	standard	color	scheme	used	for	your	slides,	you	must	first	switch	to Slide	Master	view.	You	find	out	more	about	working	with	Slide	Masters	in	Chapter	10, but	for	now	just	realize	that	a	Slide	Master	controls	the	overall	appearance	of	one	or more	slides.	To	switch	to	Slide	Master	view,	open	the	View	tab	in	the	Ribbon	and	click the	Slide	Master	button.	In	the	Background	group,	you’ll	find	a	Colors	button,	which you	can	click	to	reveal	the	drop-down	list	shown	in	Figure	8-3.	Then	you	can	choose the	color	scheme	you	want	to	apply.   Figure	8-3:	The	Colors	drop-down	list.  Creating	your	own	color	scheme If	you	don’t	like	any	color	schemes	that	come	with	the	built-in	themes,	you	can	create your	own	color	scheme.	Here	are	the	steps:  1.	 Select	a	color	scheme	that’s	close	to	the	one	you	want	to	use.  	Be	warned	that	after	you	deviate	from	the	preselected	color	scheme  combinations,	you’d	better	have	some	color	sense.	If	you	can’t	tell	chartreuse	from lime,	you	should	leave	this	stuff	to	the	pros.  2.	 Select	Customize	Colors	from	the	bottom	of	the	Colors	drop-down	menu.  The	Create	New	Theme	Colors	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-4.  3.	 Click	the	button	for	the	color	you	want	to	change.  For	example,	to	change	the	first	accent	color,	click	the	Accent	1	button.	You	then see	a	gallery	of	color	choices,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-5.  4.	 Pick	a	color	you	like.  As	you	can	see,	a	plethora	of	color	choices	is	available.	This	gallery	reminds	me	of the	shelf	of	paint	color	chips	in	the	paint	section	of	a	hardware	store.   5.	 If	you	don’t	like	any	of	the	choices,	click	the	More	Colors	button.  Doing	this	brings	up	the	Colors	dialog	box,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-6.	As	you	can	see, PowerPoint	displays	what	looks	like	a	tie-dyed	version	of	Chinese	checkers.	 Note that	this	dialog	box	comes	up	with	the	Standard	tab	selected.	If	you	used	the Custom	tab	the	last	time	you	used	this	dialog	box,	the	Custom	tab	will	be	selected instead.   6.	 Click	the	color	that	you	want	and	then	click	OK.  After	you	click	OK,	you’re	whisked	back	to	the	Create	New	Theme	Colors	dialog box.  7.	  Optional 	Repeat	Steps	3	through	6	for	any	other	colors	you	want	to	change. 8.	 Click	Save.  The	new	color	scheme	is	saved.  Figure	8-4:	Creating	new	theme	colors.   Figure	8-5:	Changing	a	color.  Figure	8-6:	A	wonderful	world	of	color.  	The	Standard	tab	of	the	Colors	dialog	box	 refer	to	Figure	8-6 	shows	127  popular	colors,	plus	white,	black,	and	shades	of	gray.	If	you	want	to	use	a	color that	doesn’t	appear	in	the	dialog	box,	click	the	Custom	tab.	This	step	draws	forth the	custom	color	controls,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-7.	From	this	tab	in	the	dialog	box, you	can	construct	any	of	the	16	million	colors	that	are	theoretically	possible	with PowerPoint.	You	need	a	PhD	in	physics	to	figure	out	how	to	adjust	the	Red, Green,	and	Blue	controls,	though.	Mess	around	with	this	stuff	if	you	want,	but you’re	on	your	own.   Figure	8-7:	PowerPoint	offers	16	million	colors	from	which	you	can	choose.  Using	theme	fonts Theme	fonts	are	similar	to	theme	colors,	but	theme	fonts	have	fewer	choices.	Although there	are	12	colors	per	theme,	there	are	only	two	fonts:	one	for	headings,	the	other	for body	text. If	you	don’t	want	to	use	the	fonts	associated	with	the	theme	you’ve	chosen	for	your presentation,	you	can	use	the	Theme	Fonts	button	at	the	right	side	of	the	Themes	group on	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to	choose	fonts	from	a	different	theme.	Then	the	fonts you	select	are	applied	throughout	your	presentation.  	Note	that	changing	the	theme	font	is	not	the	same	as	changing	the	font	via	the  Font	controls	found	in	the	Font	group	of	the	Home	tab.	When	you	use	the	Font controls	on	the	Home	tab,	you’re	applying	direct	formatting.	Direct	formatting temporarily	overrides	the	font	setting	specified	by	the	theme.	As	a	general	rule, you	should	use	theme	fonts	to	set	the	fonts	used	throughout	a	presentation.	Use direct	formatting	sparingly	—	when	you	want	to	create	a	word	or	two	in	a	font that	differs	from	the	rest	of	the	presentation.  You	can	change	the	font	used	in	a	theme	by	clicking	the	Theme	Fonts	button	and	then choosing	Customize	Fonts.	Doing	this	brings	up	the	Create	New	Theme	Fonts	dialog box,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-8.	Here	you	can	change	the	font	used	for	headings	and	body text.  Figure	8-8:	Changing	theme	fonts.  Applying	theme	effects Another	major	component	of	PowerPoint	themes	are	the	theme	effects,	which	apply subtle	variations	to	the	graphical	look	of	your	presentations.	Theme	effects	are	applied automatically	whenever	you	apply	a	theme.	However,	you	can	apply	theme	effects from	a	different	theme	by	clicking	the	Effects	button	at	the	right	side	of	the	Themes group	on	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	This	brings	up	the	Theme	Effects	gallery,	as shown	in	Figure	8-9.	You	can	choose	any	of	the	theme	effects	listed.   Figure	8-9:	Changing	theme	effects.   Changing	the	Slide	Size  The	Customize	group	of	the	Design	ribbon	tab	includes	a	Slide	Size	control	that	lets you	change	the	size	of	the	slide	from	standard	to	widescreen.	You	should	use widescreen	only	if	you	plan	on	showing	the	presentation	on	a	projector	that	displays	in widescreen	format. Besides	standard	and	widescreen	formats,	you	can	also	click	the	Slide	Size	button	and then	choose	Customize	Slide	Size.	Doing	this	brings	up	the	Slide	Size	dialog	box,	as shown	in	Figure	8-10.	This	dialog	box	gives	you	extra	control	over	your	presentation’s page	setup.  Figure	8-10:	The	Slide	Size	dialog	box.  The	following	list	describes	the	controls	in	this	dialog	box:  Slides	Sized	For:	This	drop-down	list	lets	you	set	the	size	of	your	slides	based	on how	you	plan	to	present	them.	The	most	common	is	to	present	the	slides	on	a standard	computer	screen,	which	has	an	aspect	ratio	of	4:3.	 Aspect	ratio	is	the	ratio of	the	screen’s	width	to	its	height.	Although	4:3	is	a	common	aspect	ratio,	many newer	computers	use	widescreen	displays,	which	usually	have	an	aspect	ratio	of 16:9. 	Other	options	on	this	drop-down	list	include	different	screen	ratios	 suitable for	widescreen	displays ,	standard	sized	paper,	and	even	35mm	slides.	A	Custom option	even	lets	you	set	whatever	width	and	height	you	want	for	your	slides. Width:	Lets	you	set	a	custom	width	for	your	slides. Height:	Lets	you	set	a	custom	height	for	your	slides. Number	Slides	From:	If	your	slides	include	numbers,	this	option	lets	you	set	the number	for	the	first	slide.	The	default	is	1. Orientation:	Lets	you	set	the	orientation	to	portrait	 tall	and	skinny 	or	landscape  short	and	fat .	You	can	set	the	setting	separately	for	your	slides,	handouts,	and notes.	The	most	common	setting	is	for	the	slides	to	use	landscape	orientation	and the	notes	and	handouts	to	use	portrait.   Using	Background	Styles  A	background	style	is	a	combination	of	a	background	color	chosen	from	a	theme	color scheme	and	a	background	fill	effect.	The	color	scheme	always	includes	four	colors	that can	be	used	for	the	background	—	two	light	colors	and	two	dark	colors.	In	addition, you	can	choose	from	three	background	fill	effects.	These	three	fills	are	Subtle, Moderate,	and	Intense.	For	example,	the	Subtle	fill	might	be	a	solid	color,	the Moderate	fill	might	be	a	gentle	pattern	applied	to	the	color,	and	the	Intense	fill	might be	a	bold	gradient	fill. Each	combination	of	the	four	background	colors	and	three	background	fills	is	a background	style.	Thus,	each	theme	provides	a	total	of	12	background	styles. To	apply	one	of	the	theme’s	background	styles	to	your	presentation,	use	the Background	Styles	control	in	the	Background	group	on	the	Design	tab.	This	control reveals	the	Background	Styles	gallery,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-11.  Figure	8-11:	Changing	the	background	style.  Using	a	gradient	fill You	may	have	noticed	that	the	slide	background	used	in	many	PowerPoint	templates	is not	a	solid	color.	Instead,	the	color	is	gradually	shaded	from	top	to	bottom.	This	type	of shading	—	gradient	fill	—	creates	an	interesting	visual	effect.	For	example,	look	at	the   slide	shown	in	Figure	8-12.	This	slide	was	based	on	the	standard	Office	Theme	that comes	with	PowerPoint	2016.	The	background	is	light	pink	in	the	center	and	fades	to darker	pink	on	the	edges.  Figure	8-12:	Using	a	gradient	fill	to	create	an	interesting	background.  You	can	create	your	own	custom	gradient	fill	by	following	these	steps:  1.	 Choose	the	slide	that	you	want	to	shade.  This	step	isn’t	necessary	if	you	want	to	apply	the	shading	to	all	slides	in	the presentation.  2.	 Click	the	Background	Styles	button	in	the	Background	group	of	the	Design	tab  on	the	Ribbon. The	Background	Styles	gallery	appears.  3.	 Click	Format	Background.  Doing	this	brings	up	the	Format	Background	pane	that	appears	to	the	right	of	the slide,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-13.  4.	 Select	the	Gradient	Fill	radio	button	if	it	isn’t	already	selected. 5.	 Set	the	gradient	fill	options	the	way	you	want	them.  You	have	to	play	with	the	controls	until	you	get	a	feel	for	how	they	work.	Start	by selecting	the	present	colors,	which	let	you	choose	one	of	several	predefined	fill patterns.	Then	play	with	the	controls	until	you	get	the	fill	to	look	the	way	you	want. You	can	choose	the	colors	to	use	for	the	fill,	the	transparency	level,	the	direction, and	several	variants	for	each	option.  6.	 Click	OK.   Figure	8-13:	The	Format	Background	pane.  Using	other	background	effects Besides	gradient	fills,	you	can	use	the	Format	Background	dialog	box	to	create	several other	interesting	types	of	backgrounds.	For	example,	you	can	assign	a	picture	of	your choosing,	or	you	can	use	one	of	several	predefined	patterns	supplied	with	PowerPoint. To	use	a	texture,	select	the	Picture	or	Texture	Fill	radio	button.	Then	click	the	Texture button	to	reveal	the	Texture	gallery,	as	shown	in	Figure	8-14.  Figure	8-14:	Using	a	textured	background.  You	can	also	use	the	Picture	or	Texture	Fill	radio	button	to	select	an	image	file	of	your   own.	Just	click	the	File	button	and	then	select	the	file	you	want	to	use.	Or,	you	can import	an	image	from	the	Clipboard	or	select	a	clip	art	image.	The	remaining	controls on	this	dialog	box	let	you	further	tweak	the	appearance	of	the	picture	or	text	you	select. Finally,	you	can	use	a	Pattern	Fill	to	create	a	background	from	one	of	several predefined	patterns	of	hash	lines.   Chapter	9   Animating	Your	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Creating	slide	transitions 	Animating	text 	Working	with	custom	animations 	Setting	animation	timings 	Creating	jiggle	text  If	you	plan	to	run	your	presentation	on	your	computer’s	screen	or	on	a	computer projector,	you	can	use	 or	abuse 	a	bagful	of	exciting	onscreen	PowerPoint	animations. The	audience	members	probably	won’t	be	fooled	into	thinking	that	you	hired	Disney	to create	your	slides,	but	they’ll	be	impressed	all	the	same.	Animations	are	just	one	more example	of	how	PowerPoint	can	make	even	the	dullest	content	look	spectacular. This	chapter	begins	with	slide	transitions,	which	are	not	technically	animations	because they	don’t	involve	movement	of	individual	items	on	a	slide.	However,	slide	transitions are	usually	used	in	concert	with	animations	to	create	presentations	that	are	as	much	fun to	watch	as	they	are	informative.   Using	Slide	Transitions  A	transition	is	how	PowerPoint	gets	from	one	slide	to	the	next	during	an	onscreen	slide show.	The	normal	way	to	segue	from	slide	to	slide	is	simply	cutting	to	the	new	slide	— effective,	yes,	but	also	boring.	PowerPoint	enables	you	to	assign	any	of	the	more	than 50	different	special	effects	to	each	slide	transition.	For	example,	you	can	have	the	next slide	scoot	over	the	top	of	the	current	slide	from	any	direction,	or	you	can	have	the current	slide	scoot	off	the	screen	in	any	direction	to	reveal	the	next	slide.	You	can	have slides	fade	out,	dissolve	into	each	other,	open	up	like	Venetian	blinds,	or	spin	in	like spokes	on	a	wheel. You	can	control	slide	transitions	by	using	the	Transitions	tab	of	the	Ribbon,	as	shown in	Figure	9-1.  Figure	9-1:	The	Transitions	tab.  The	Transitions	tab	consists	of	three	groups	of	controls,	as	described	in	the	following list:  Preview:	This	group	includes	a	single	control	—	a	Preview	—	that	displays	a preview	of	the	transition	effect	you	selected	for	the	current	slide. Transition	to	This	Slide:	This	group	lets	you	select	the	transition	effect	that	will be	used	when	the	presentation	moves	to	this	slide. Timing:	This	group	lets	you	select	options	that	affect	how	the	transition	effect	is applied	to	the	slide,	such	as	how	quickly	the	transition	occurs	and	whether	it’s triggered	by	a	mouse	click	or	automatically	after	a	time	delay.  To	create	a	slide	transition,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	to	which	you	want	to	apply	the	transition.  Note	that	the	transition	applies	when	you	come	to	the	slide	you	apply	the	transition to,	not	when	you	go	to	the	next	slide.	For	example,	if	you	apply	a	transition	to	slide 3,	the	transition	is	displayed	when	you	move	from	slide	2	to	slide	3,	not	when	you move	from	slide	3	to	slide	4. If	you	want	to	apply	the	animation	scheme	to	all	your	slides,	you	can	skip	this	step because	it	won’t	matter	which	slide	you	start	from.  	If	you	want	to	apply	different	transitions	to	different	slides,	you	may	prefer  to	work	in	Slide	Sorter	View	 click	the	Slide	Sorter	View	button	near	the	bottom- right	corner	of	the	screen ,	which	allows	you	to	see	more	slides	at	once.	If	you’re   going	to	use	the	same	transition	for	all	your	slides,	though,	no	benefit	comes	from switching	to	Slide	Sorter	View.  2.	 Select	the	transition	you	want	to	apply	from	the	Transition	to	This	Slide  section	of	the	Transitions	tab	on	the	Ribbon. If	you	want,	you	can	display	the	complete	gallery	of	transition	effects	by	clicking the	More	button	at	the	bottom	right	of	the	mini-gallery	of	transition	effects displayed	within	the	Ribbon.	Figure	9-2	shows	the	complete	Transitions	gallery. Note	that	when	you	select	a	transition,	PowerPoint	previews	the	transition	by animating	the	current	slide.	If	you	want	to	see	the	preview	again,	just	click	the transition	again.  3.	 Use	the	Effect	Options	drop-down	list	to	select	a	variation	of	the	transition  effect	you	selected	in	Step	2. The	available	variations	depend	on	the	transition	you’ve	chosen.	For	example,	if you	choose	the	Wipe	transition,	the	following	variations	are	available:  From	Right From	Left From	Top From	Bottom From	Top-Right From	Bottom-Right From	Top-Left From	Bottom-Left  4.	 If	you	want,	use	the	Sound	drop-down	list	to	apply	a	sound	effect.  The	Sound	drop-down	list	lists	a	collection	of	standard	transition	sounds,	such	as applause,	a	cash	register,	and	the	standard	whoosh.	You	can	also	choose	Other Sound	to	use	your	own	.wav	file.  5.	 Use	the	Duration	drop-down	list	to	control	how	fast	the	transition	should  proceed. The	default	is	1	second,	but	you	can	specify	a	slower	or	faster	speed	if	you	want.  6.	 Use	the	On	Mouse	Click	or	After	options	to	indicate	how	the	transition	should  be	triggered. If	you	want	to	control	the	pace	of	the	slide	show	yourself,	select	the	On	Mouse Click	check	box.	Then,	the	slide	will	remain	visible	until	you	click	the	mouse.	If you	want	the	slide	to	advance	automatically	after	a	delay,	select	the	After	check box	and	specify	the	time	delay.   Figure	9-2:	The	Transitions	gallery.  	To	apply	the	animation	to	the	entire	presentation,	click	Apply	to	All.	This  applies	the	animation	to	all	the	slides	in	the	presentation.  Here	are	some	additional	points	to	keep	in	mind	when	using	slide	transitions:  Consider	computer	speed:	Transition	effects	look	better	on	faster	computers, which	have	more	raw	processing	horsepower	to	implement	the	fancy	pixel dexterity	required	to	produce	good-looking	transitions.	If	your	computer	is	a	bit slow,	change	the	speed	setting	to	Fast	so	the	transition	won’t	drag. Select	sets	of	transitions:	Some	of	the	transition	effects	come	in	matched	sets	that apply	the	same	effect	from	different	directions.	You	can	create	a	cohesive	set	of transitions	by	alternating	among	these	related	effects	from	slide	to	slide.	For example,	set	up	the	first	slide	with	Wipe	Right,	the	second	slide	with	Wipe	Left,	the third	with	Wipe	Down,	and	so	on. Preview	transitions:	When	you	work	in	Slide	Sorter	View,	you	can	click	the	little star	icon	beneath	each	slide	to	preview	the	transition	for	that	slide.	Also,	the automatic	slide	timing	is	shown	beneath	the	slide	if	you	set	the	slide	to	advance automatically.   Using	the	Animations	Tab  Besides	slide	transitions,	the	most	common	type	of	animation	in	PowerPoint	is	adding entrance	and	exit	effects	to	the	text	that	appears	on	the	slide.	This	effect	is	especially useful	for	bullet	lists	because	it	lets	you	display	the	list	one	item	at	a	time.	You	can have	each	item	appear	out	of	nowhere,	drop	from	the	top	of	the	screen,	march	in	from the	left	or	right,	or	do	a	back	somersault	followed	by	two	cartwheels	and	a	double-twist flip	 talc,	please! . This	type	of	animation	is	often	called	a	build	effect	because	it	lets	you	build	your	points one	by	one.	It’s	easy	to	apply	this	type	of	animation	using	the	Animations	tab	of	the Ribbon,	shown	in	Figure	9-3.  Figure	9-3:	The	Animations	tab.  The	Animations	tab	consists	of	four	groups	of	controls,	as	described	in	the	following list:  Preview:	This	group	includes	a	single	control	—	a	Preview	button	—	that	displays a	preview	of	the	animation	effects	you	selected	for	the	current	slide. Animation:	This	group	lets	you	select	one	of	several	predefined	animations	for	the selected	object. Advanced	Animation:	The	controls	in	this	group	let	you	create	custom	animations with	features	that	the	basic	animations	provided	by	using	the	Animation	group.	For more	information,	see	the	section	“Customizing	Your	Animation,”	later	in	this chapter. Timing:	This	group	lets	you	set	the	timing	of	the	animation.	For	more	information, see	the	section	“Timing	your	animations,”	later	in	this	chapter.  To	apply	an	animation	effect,	first	select	the	text	box	that	you	want	to	animate.	Then, choose	the	animation	style	from	the	Animation	gallery	on	the	Animations	tab. Like	other	PowerPoint	galleries,	the	Animation	gallery	includes	a	More	button	 at	the bottom	right 	that	summons	the	complete	gallery,	as	shown	in	Figure	9-4.   Figure	9-4:	The	Animation	gallery.  After	you	apply	a	basic	animation,	you	can	use	the	Effect	Options	drop-down	list	to select	one	of	several	variations	of	the	animation.	For	example,	if	you	choose	the	Fly	In animation,	the	Effect	Options	drop-down	list	lets	you	pick	the	direction	from	which	the object	will	fly	on	to	the	slide.  	Notice	that	there	are	several	More…	menu	items	at	the	bottom	of	the  Animation	gallery.	You	can	click	any	of	these	buttons	to	reveal	even	more preanimation	types. For	more	complex	animations,	you	need	to	use	custom	animations	as	described	in	the next	section,	“Customizing	Your	Animation.”   Customizing	Your	Animation  Custom	animation	is	the	nitty-gritty	of	PowerPoint	animation.	Custom	animation	is	the only	way	to	apply	text	animation	that’s	more	complicated	than	the	predefined	Fade, Wipe,	or	Fly	In	styles	of	the	Animate	drop-down	list.	In	addition	to	animating	text, custom	animation	lets	you	animate	other	objects	on	your	slides,	such	as	pictures, shapes,	and	charts. Understanding	custom	animation Before	I	get	into	the	details	of	setting	up	custom	animation,	you	need	to	understand some	basic	concepts.	Don’t	worry	—	this	won’t	get	too	technical.	But	you	need	to know	this	stuff	before	you	start	creating	custom	animations. For	starters,	you	can	apply	custom	animations	to	any	object	on	a	slide,	whether	it’s	a text	placeholder,	a	drawing	object	such	as	an	AutoShape	or	a	text	box,	or	a	clip	art picture.	For	text	objects,	you	can	apply	the	animation	to	the	text	object	as	a	whole	or	to individual	paragraphs	within	the	object.	You	can	also	specify	whether	the	effect	goes all	at	once,	word	by	word,	or	letter	by	letter.	And	you	can	indicate	whether	the	effect happens	automatically	or	whether	PowerPoint	waits	for	you	to	click	the	mouse	or	press Enter	to	initiate	the	animation. Custom	animation	lets	you	create	four	basic	types	of	animation	effects	for	slide	objects:  Entrance	effect:	This	is	how	an	object	enters	the	slide.	If	you	don’t	specify	an entrance	effect,	the	object	starts	in	whatever	position	that	you	placed	it	on	the	slide. If	you	want	to	be	more	creative,	though,	you	can	have	objects	appear	by	using	any of	the	52	different	entrance	effects,	such	as	Appear,	Blinds,	Fade,	Descend, Boomerang,	Bounce,	Sling,	and	many	others. Emphasis	effect:	This	effect	lets	you	draw	attention	to	an	object	that’s	already	on the	slide.	PowerPoint	offers	31	different	emphasis	effects,	including	Change	Fill Color,	Change	Font	Size,	Grow Shrink,	Spin,	Teeter,	Flicker,	Color	Blend,	Blast, and	many	more. Exit	effect:	This	is	how	an	object	leaves	the	slide.	Most	objects	don’t	have	exit effects,	but	if	you	want	an	object	to	leave,	you	can	apply	one	of	the	52	different effects	—	which	are	similar	to	the	entrance	effects	—	Disappear,	Blinds,	Peek	Out, Ease	Out,	Spiral	Out,	and	so	on. Motion	path:	Motion	paths	are	the	most	interesting	types	of	custom	animation.	A motion	path	lets	you	create	a	track	along	which	the	object	travels	when	animated. PowerPoint	provides	you	with	64	predefined	motion	paths,	such	as	circles,	stars, teardrops,	spirals,	springs,	and	so	on.	If	that’s	not	enough,	you	can	draw	your	own custom	path	to	make	an	object	travel	anywhere	on	the	slide	you	want	it	to	go. If	the	motion	path	begins	off	the	slide	and	ends	somewhere	on	the	slide,	the	motion path	effect	is	similar	to	an	entrance	effect.	If	the	path	begins	on	the	slide	but	ends   off	the	slide,	the	motion	path	effect	is	like	an	exit	effect.	And	if	the	path	begins	and ends	on	the	slide,	it	is	similar	to	an	emphasis	effect.	In	that	case,	when	the animation	starts,	the	object	appears,	travels	along	its	path,	and	then	zips	off	the slide. To	draw	a	custom	motion	path,	click	the	Add	Effect	button	in	the	Custom Animation	pane,	choose	Motion	Paths	Draw,	and	then	choose	Draw	Custom	Path and	select	one	of	the	motion	path	drawing	tools	from	the	menu	that	appears.	The tools	include	straight	lines,	curves,	freeform	shapes,	and	scribbles.	You	can	then draw	your	motion	path	using	the	tool	you	selected.  You	can	create	more	than	one	animation	for	a	given	object.	For	example,	you	can	give an	object	an	entrance	effect,	an	emphasis	effect,	and	an	exit	effect.	That	lets	you	bring the	object	onscreen,	draw	attention	to	it,	and	then	have	it	leave.	If	you	want,	you	can have	several	emphasis	or	motion	path	effects	for	a	single	object.	You	can	also	have more	than	one	entrance	and	exit	effect,	but	in	most	cases,	one	will	do. Each	effect	that	you	apply	has	one	or	more	property	settings	that	you	can	tweak	to customize	the	effect.	All	the	effects	have	a	Speed	setting	that	lets	you	set	the	speed	for the	animation.	Some	effects	have	an	additional	property	setting	that	lets	you	control	the range	of	an	object’s	movement.	 For	example,	the	Spin	effect	has	an	Amount	setting that	governs	how	far	the	object	spins.   	If	you	want,	you	can	create	a	trigger	that	causes	an	animation	effect	to	operate when	you	click	an	object	on	the	slide.	For	example,	you	might	create	a	trigger	so that	all	the	text	in	a	text	placeholder	pulsates	in	when	you	click	the	slide	title.	To do	so,	first	add	the	animation	effect	to	the	text.	Then,	click	Trigger	in	the Advanced	Animation	group	and	choose	On	Click	Of.	A	list	of	all	objects	on	the slide	that	can	be	clicked	is	displayed;	select	the	Title	placeholder.	 You	can	also trigger	an	animation	when	a	specific	location	is	reached	during	playback	of	a video	file.	For	more	information,	refer	to	Chapter	15.   Using	the	Animation	pane The	Animation	pane	is	a	task	pane	that	appears	to	the	right	of	the	slide	and	displays important	information	about	the	animations	you	have	added	to	your	slides.	The	Custom Animation	task	pane	is	hidden	by	default,	but	I	recommend	you	turn	it	on	before	you start	adding	custom	animations	to	your	slides.	To	turn	on	the	Custom	Animation	task pane,	just	click	the	Animation	Pane	button	in	the	Advanced	Animation	section	of	the Animation	Ribbon	tab. Figure	9-5	shows	how	the	Animation	pane	appears	for	a	slide	that	has	not	yet	had	any animations	added	to	it.   Figure	9-5:	The	Animation	pane.  In	the	sections	that	follow,	you	find	out	how	to	use	the	Animation	pane	as	you	create custom	animations. Adding	an	effect To	animate	an	object	on	a	slide,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 In	Normal	View,	call	up	the	slide	that	contains	the	object	you	want	to	animate  and	then	click	the	object	to	select	it. For	example,	to	animate	text	paragraphs,	select	the	text	placeholder	that	holds	the text.  2.	 If	you	haven’t	already	done	so,	click	the	Animation	Pane	button.  This	step	opens	the	Custom	Animation	task	pane.  3.	 Click	the	Animations	tab	on	the	Ribbon. 4.	 Click	the	Add	Animation	button	and	then	select	the	effect	you	want	to	create  from	the	menu	that	appears. Clicking	the	Add	Animation	button	menu	reveals	a	menu	that	lists	the	four	types	of effects:	Entrance,	Emphasis,	Exit,	and	Motion	Path.	In	this	example,	I	chose	the Bounce	entrance	effect.   The	entrance	effect	you	selected	is	added	to	the	Animation	pane,	as	shown	in Figure	9-6. Note	that	each	of	the	paragraphs	in	the	text	placeholder	has	been	assigned	the number	1	or	2	to	indicate	the	sequence	in	which	the	paragraphs	will	be	animated.	In the	Custom	Animation	pane,	the	animation	that	was	added	in	Step	4	is	given	the single	number	1;	number	2	doesn’t	appear	in	the	pane.	That’s	because	although	this animation	is	applied	to	two	separate	paragraphs,	it	is	treated	as	a	single	animation in	the	Custom	Animation	pane. However,	if	you	click	the	double-down	arrow	beneath	the	animation,	the	two separate	paragraph	animations	will	be	listed	individually,	as	shown	in	Figure	9-7. 5.	  Optional 	Use	the	Effect	Options	control	to	select	additional	options	for	the  effect. To	set	the	effect	options,	click	the	down	arrow	to	the	right	of	the	animation	for which	you	want	to	set	effect	options;	then	choose	Effect	Options	from	the	drop- down	menu	 not	the	Effects	Options	button	in	the	Ribbon .	This	brings	up	a	dialog box	that	lets	you	choose	options	for	the	effect	you’ve	selected.	For	example,	if	you choose	a	Fly	In	effect,	you	can	specify	the	direction	from	which	you	want	the	text to	fly.  6.	 To	preview	the	animation,	click	the	Play	button	at	the	bottom	of	the	Custom  Animation	task	pane. Or,	if	you	prefer,	just	run	the	slide	show	to	see	how	the	animation	looks.	If	nothing happens,	click	the	mouse	button	to	start	the	animation.  Figure	9-6:	The	Animation	pane	after	an	animation	has	been	added.   Figure	9-7:	Text	paragraphs	can	be	listed	separately	in	the	Custom	Animation	pane.  If	you	add	more	than	one	effect	to	a	slide,	the	effects	are	initiated	one	at	a	time	by mouse	clicks,	in	the	order	you	create	them.	You	can	drag	effects	up	or	down	in	the custom	animation	list	to	change	the	order	of	the	effects.	For	more	information	about changing	the	order	or	setting	up	automatic	effects,	see	the	“Timing	your	animations” section,	later	in	this	chapter. You	can	further	tweak	an	effect	by	clicking	the	down	arrow	that	appears	next	to	the effect	in	the	custom	animation	list	and	then	choosing	Effect	Options.	Doing	this	brings up	a	dialog	box	similar	to	the	one	shown	in	Figure	9-8.	This	dialog	box	has	settings that	let	you	add	a	sound	to	the	animation,	change	the	color	of	the	object	after	the animation	completes,	and	specify	how	you	want	text	animated	 All	at	Once,	One	Word at	a	Time,	or	One	Letter	at	a	Time .	Depending	on	the	type	of	effect,	additional	controls might	appear	in	this	dialog	box.  Figure	9-8:	The	settings	dialog	box	for	an	animation	effect.  More	about	animating	text The	most	common	reason	for	animating	text	is	to	draw	attention	to	your	text	one paragraph	at	a	time	while	you	show	your	presentation.	One	way	to	do	this	is	to	create an	entrance	effect	for	the	text	placeholder	and	then	adjust	the	effect	settings	so	that	the entrance	effect	is	applied	one	paragraph	at	a	time.	When	you	do	that,	your	slide	initially   appears	empty	except	for	the	title.	Click	once,	and	the	first	paragraph	appears.	Talk about	that	paragraph	for	a	while	and	then	click	again	to	bring	up	the	second	paragraph. You	can	keep	talking	and	clicking	until	all	the	paragraphs	have	appeared.	When	you click	again,	PowerPoint	calls	up	the	next	slide. Another	approach	is	to	use	an	emphasis	effect	instead	of	an	entrance	effect.	This	sort	of effect	allows	all	the	paragraphs	to	display	initially	on	the	slide.	When	you	click	the mouse,	the	emphasis	effect	is	applied	to	the	first	paragraph	—	it	changes	colors, increases	in	size,	spins,	whatever.	Each	time	you	click,	the	emphasis	effect	is	applied	to the	next	paragraph	in	sequence. Either	way,	you	must	first	add	the	effect	for	the	text	placeholder	and	then	call	up	the Effect	Settings	dialog	box	by	clicking	the	down	arrow	next	to	the	effect	in	the	custom animation	list	and	then	choosing	Effect	Settings.	Doing	this	summons	the	settings dialog	box	for	the	text	object.	Click	the	Text	Animation	tab	to	see	the	animation settings,	shown	in	Figure	9-9.  Figure	9-9:	Animating	text.  The	Group	Text	setting,	found	on	the	Text	Animation	tab	of	the	Animation	Settings dialog	box,	controls	how	paragraphs	appear	when	you	click	the	mouse	during	the	show, based	on	the	paragraph’s	outline	level.	If	you	have	only	one	outline	level	on	the	slide, grouping	By	1st	Level	Paragraphs	will	do.	If	you	have	two	or	more	levels,	grouping text	By	1st	Level	Paragraphs	causes	each	paragraph	to	be	animated	along	with	any paragraphs	that	are	subordinate	to	it.	If	you’d	rather	animate	the	second-level paragraphs	separately,	group	your	text	By	2nd	Level	Paragraphs	instead. The	other	controls	on	this	tab	let	you	animate	each	paragraph	automatically	after	a certain	time	interval	or	display	the	paragraphs	in	reverse	order. Timing	your	animations   Most	animations	are	initiated	by	mouse	clicks.	However,	you	can	set	up	several animations	to	activate	automatically	—	in	sequence	or	all	at	the	same	time.	To	do	so, you	must	use	PowerPoint’s	Animation	Timing	features. The	first	trick	to	controlling	animation	timing	is	to	get	the	effects	listed	in	the	custom animation	list	in	the	correct	order.	Effects	are	added	to	the	list	in	the	order	you	create them.	If	you	plan	carefully,	you	might	be	able	to	create	the	effects	in	the	same	order that	you	want	to	animate	them.	More	likely,	you’ll	need	to	change	the	order	of	the effects.	Fortunately,	you	can	do	that	easily	enough	by	dragging	the	effects	up	or	down in	the	Custom	Animation	task	pane. After	you	get	the	effects	in	the	right	order,	choose	an	option	from	the	Start	drop-down list	that’s	near	the	top	of	the	Custom	Animation	task	pane	to	set	the	Start	setting	for each	effect.	This	setting	has	three	options:  Start	On	Click:	Starts	the	effect	when	you	click	the	mouse	or	press	Enter. Start	With	Previous:	Starts	the	effect	when	the	effect	immediately	above	it	starts. Use	this	option	to	animate	two	or	more	objects	simultaneously. Start	After	Previous:	Starts	the	effect	as	soon	as	the	preceding	effect	finishes.  Starting	with	the	first	effect	in	the	list,	click	each	effect	to	select	it	and	then	choose	the Start	setting	for	the	effect.	If	all	the	effects	except	the	first	are	set	to	With	Previous	or After	Previous,	the	entire	slide’s	animations	run	automatically	after	you	start	the	first effect	by	clicking	the	mouse. For	example,	Figure	9-10	shows	a	slide	with	three	polygons	drawn	to	resemble	pieces of	a	puzzle.	You	can	animate	this	puzzle	so	that	the	three	pieces	come	together	at	the same	time.  Figure	9-10:	An	animated	puzzle.   	If	you	want	to	find	out	how	to	draw	the	shapes	that	are	animated	in	this  illustration,	you	can	look	ahead	to	Chapter	12.  Follow	these	steps	to	set	up	an	animated	puzzle	like	the	one	shown	in	Figure	9-10:  1.	 Add	a	Fly	In	entrance	effect	for	the	top-left	piece	with	the	following	settings:  2.	 Add	a	Fly	In	entrance	effect	for	the	top-right	piece	with	the	following	settings:  3.	 Add	a	Fly	In	entrance	effect	for	the	bottom	piece	with	the	following	settings:  Start:	On	Click Direction:	From	Top-Left Duration:	2	Seconds  Start:	With	Previous Direction:	From	Top-Right Duration:	2	Seconds  Start:	With	Previous Direction:	From	Bottom Duration:	2	Seconds  For	even	more	control	over	an	effect’s	timings,	click	the	down	arrow	to	the	right	of	the effect	and	then	choose	Timing.	A	dialog	box	similar	to	the	one	in	Figure	9-11	appears. Here’s	the	lowdown	on	the	timing	settings:  Start:	This	is	the	same	as	the	Start	setting	in	the	Custom	Animation	task	pane. Delay:	This	lets	you	delay	the	start	of	the	animation	by	a	specified	number	of seconds. Duration:	This	is	the	same	as	the	Speed	setting	in	the	Custom	Animation	task pane. Repeat:	This	lets	you	repeat	the	effect	so	that	the	object	is	animated	several	times in	succession. Rewind	When	Done	Playing:	Certain	effects	leave	the	object	in	a	different condition	than	the	object	was	when	you	started.	For	example,	the	object	might change	color	or	size	or	move	to	a	new	position	on	the	slide.	If	you	select	the Rewind	When	Done	Playing	option,	the	object	is	restored	to	its	original	condition when	the	animation	finishes.   Figure	9-11:	Establishing	the	timing	settings.   Making	Text	Jiggle  One	of	my	favorite	cute	little	animations	is	to	make	text	—	especially	a	short	heading —	jiggle.	Not	a	lot,	but	just	a	little.	The	effect	works	best	if	the	text	has	a	funny typeface,	such	as	Cosmic	or	Jokerman.	By	using	a	very	small	motion	path	and	setting the	timing	options	to	repeat	until	the	end	of	the	slide,	you	can	make	the	text	jiggle	just a	little	bit	the	entire	time	the	slide	is	onscreen:  1.	 Type	the	text	that	you	want	to	jiggle	and	use	the	Font	drop-down	list	to	choose  an	appropriately	silly	typeface. Jokerman	is	a	favorite	font	for	jiggling	text.  2.	 Use	the	Zoom	control	at	the	bottom-right	corner	of	the	screen	to	zoom	in	to  400%. You	want	to	zoom	way	in	so	that	you	can	draw	a	very	small	motion	path.  3.	 On	the	Animation	tab,	click	Add	Animation	and	then	choose	Custom	Path  from	the	Motion	Paths	section	of	the	gallery.	 You	probably	have	to	scroll	the gallery	to	see	this	option.  The	cursor	changes	to	a	little	pencil.  4.	 Draw	a	tightly	knit	scribble	pattern	directly	in	the	center	of	the	text.  Just	wiggle	the	pencil	cursor	back	and	forth	and	up	and	down	in	an	area	of	just	a few	pixels.	Go	back	and	forth	quite	a	few	times	to	make	the	jiggle	effect	appear	to be	random.  5.	 Zoom	back	out	to	normal	size. 6.	 In	the	Custom	Animation	task	pane,	click	the	arrow	next	to	the	animation	you  just	created	and	then	choose	Timing. This	step	brings	up	the	dialog	box	that	lets	you	set	the	timing	options.  7.	 Change	the	speed	to	2	seconds	and	the	Repeat	drop-down	to	Until	End	of  Slide.	Then	click	OK.  8.	 Run	the	slide	show	to	check	the	effect.  You	might	have	to	try	this	several	times	before	you	get	an	effect	you	like,	adjusting	the random	scribbles	or	the	duration	of	the	animation.	Don’t	be	afraid	to	experiment!   Using	the	Animation	Painter  The	Animation	Painter	makes	it	easy	to	copy	a	complete	animation	effect	from	one object	to	another.	To	use	the	Animation	Painter,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Use	the	techniques	presented	throughout	this	chapter	to	apply	an	animation  effect	to	one	of	the	objects	in	your	slide	show.  2.	 Select	the	object	you	have	animated. 3.	 In	the	Custom	Animation	group	of	the	Animation	Ribbon	tab,	click	the  Animation	Painter	button. The	mouse	pointer	changes	to	a	little	paintbrush.  4.	 Click	the	object	you	want	to	apply	the	animation	to.  The	animation	that	you	created	for	the	object	selected	in	Step	2	is	applied	to	the object	you	clicked	on	in	this	step.  	If	you	want	to	apply	the	animation	to	more	than	one	object,	double-click	the  Animation	Painter	button	in	Step	3.	Then,	you	can	repeat	Step	4	as	many	times	as you	wish	to	copy	the	animation	to	multiple	objects.	When	your	animation	frenzy has	come	to	a	close,	press	the	Esc	key.   Chapter	10   Masters	of	the	Universe	Meet	the  Templates	of	Doom  In	This	Chapter  	Discovering	stuff	about	Masters	you	have	to	know 	Using	and	changing	Masters 	Working	with	headers	and	footers 	Finding	lost	placeholders 	Creating	templates  Want	to	add	a	bit	of	text	to	every	slide	in	your	presentation?	Or	maybe	add	your	name and	phone	number	at	the	bottom	of	your	audience	handouts?	Or	place	a	picture	of	Rush Limbaugh	at	the	extreme	right	side	of	each	page	of	your	speaker	notes? Masters	are	the	surefire	way	to	add	something	to	every	slide.	No	need	to	toil	separately at	each	slide.	Add	something	to	the	Master,	and	it	shows	up	automatically	on	every slide.	Remove	it	from	the	Master,	and	—	poof!	—	it	disappears	from	every	slide.	Very convenient. Masters	govern	all	aspects	of	a	slide’s	appearance:	background	color,	objects	that appear	on	every	slide,	text	that	appears	on	all	slides,	and	more.    Working	with	Masters  In	PowerPoint,	a	Master	governs	the	appearance	of	all	the	slides	or	pages	in	a presentation.	Each	presentation	has	at	least	three	Masters:  Slide	Master:	Dictates	the	format	of	your	slides You	work	with	this	Master	most	often	when	you	tweak	your	slides	to	cosmetic perfection. Handout	Master:	Controls	the	look	of	printed	handouts Notes	Master:	Determines	the	characteristics	of	printed	speaker	notes  Each	Master	specifies	the	appearance	of	text	 font,	size,	and	color,	for	example ,	slide background	color,	animation	effects,	and	any	additional	text	or	other	objects	that	you want	to	appear	on	each	slide	or	page. In	addition,	each	Master	can	contain	one	or	more	layouts	that	provide	different arrangements	of	text	and	other	elements	on	the	slide.	For	example,	a	typical	Slide Master	might	contain	a	Title	layout	and	several	Text	layouts	for	various	types	of	body text	slides. One	interesting	—	and	often	useful	—	aspect	of	Slide	Masters	is	that	any	elements	you add	to	the	Master	itself	are	also	included	in	each	layout	that’s	associated	with	the Master.	For	example,	if	you	set	the	background	color	for	the	Slide	Master,	that	color	is used	for	each	layout.	Likewise,	if	you	add	a	big	blue	rectangle	in	the	top-left	corner	of the	Slide	Master,	that	rectangle	is	visible	in	the	top-left	corner	of	each	layout. However,	you	can	also	add	elements	to	an	individual	layout.	Then,	the	element	is present	only	for	that	layout.	For	example,	you	may	want	to	add	more	graphical elements	to	the	Title	layout.	Then,	those	elements	appear	only	on	slides	that	use	the Title	layout. Here	are	a	few	other	points	to	ponder	while	you	lie	awake	at	night	thinking	about	Slide Masters:  Masters	aren’t	optional.	Every	presentation	has	them.	You	can,	however,	override the	formatting	of	objects	contained	in	the	Master	for	a	particular	slide.	This capability	enables	you	to	vary	the	appearance	of	slides	when	necessary. PowerPoint	allows	you	to	create	more	than	one	Slide	Master	in	a	single presentation,	so	you	can	mix	two	or	more	slide	designs	in	your	presentations. That’s	why	I	say	a	presentation	has	at	least	three	Masters.	If	you	have	more	than one	Slide	Master,	a	presentation	will	have	more	than	three	Masters	altogether.	Note, however,	that	you	can	still	have	only	one	Handout	or	Notes	Master	in	each presentation.	For	more	information	about	using	more	than	one	Slide	Master,	see	the section,	“Yes,	You	Can	Serve	Two	Masters,”	later	in	this	chapter. If	you’ve	used	previous	versions	of	PowerPoint,	you	might	be	wondering	what   happened	to	the	Title	Master.	In	the	old	days,	there	was	actually	a	separate	Master for	title	slides.	However,	in	PowerPoint	2016,	title	slides	don’t	have	their	own Masters.	Instead,	the	format	of	title	slides	is	controlled	by	a	Title	Slide	layout	that belongs	to	a	particular	Slide	Master.   Modifying	the	Slide	Master  If	you	don’t	like	the	layout	of	your	slides,	call	up	the	Slide	Master	and	do	something about	it,	as	shown	in	these	steps:  1.	 Open	Slide	Master	View	by	opening	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then clicking	the	Slide	Master	button,	found	in	the	Presentation	Views	group. Alternatively,	you	can	hold	down	the	Shift	key	and	then	click	the	Normal	View button	near	the	bottom	right	of	the	screen.  2.	 Behold	the	Slide	Master	in	all	its	splendor.  Figure	10-1	shows	a	typical	Slide	Master.	You	can	see	the	placeholders	for	the	slide title	and	body	text.	Although	none	are	visible	in	this	example,	the	Master	can	also contain	background	colors	and	other	elements	that	are	present	on	each	slide. The	Slide	Master	includes	placeholders	for	three	objects	that	appear	at	the	bottom of	each	slide:	the	Date	area,	Footer	area,	and	Number	area.	These	special	areas	are described	later	in	this	chapter	under	the	heading,	“Using	Headers	and	Footers.” A	thumbnail	of	each	Slide	Master	as	well	as	the	layouts	for	each	Master	are	shown on	the	left	side	of	the	screen.  3.	 Make	any	formatting	changes	that	you	want.  Select	the	text	you	want	to	apply	a	new	style	to	and	make	your	formatting	changes. If	you	want	all	the	slide	titles	to	be	in	italics,	for	example,	select	the	title	text	and then	press	Ctrl+I	or	click	the	Italic	button	on	the	Formatting	toolbar.  	Make	sure	the	Slide	Master	itself	is	selected	—	not	one	of	its	layouts.	That  way,	any	changes	you	make	apply	to	all	the	layouts	associated	with	the	Slide Master.  4.	  Optional 	To	add	elements	that	are	specific	to	one	of	the	layouts,	select	the  layout	and	then	add	your	changes. For	example,	you	may	want	to	add	more	graphical	elements	or	select	different	fonts for	your	title	slides.	To	do	that,	select	the	Title	Slide	layout	and	make	your	changes.  5.	 Click	the	Normal	View	button	near	the	bottom	right	of	the	window	to	return  to	Normal	View. You’re	done!   Figure	10-1:	Slide	Master	View.  Notice	that	the	body	object	contains	paragraphs	for	five	outline	levels	formatted	with different	point	sizes,	indentations,	and	bullet	styles.	If	you	want	to	change	the	way	an outline	level	is	formatted,	this	is	the	place	to	do	so.  	You	can	type	all	you	want	in	the	title	or	object	area	placeholders,	but	the	text  that	you	type	doesn’t	appear	on	the	slides.	The	text	that	appears	in	these placeholders	is	provided	only	so	that	you	can	see	the	effect	of	the	formatting changes	you	apply.	 To	insert	text	that	appears	on	each	slide,	see	the	upcoming section,	“Adding	recurring	text	or	other	elements.”   	You	can	edit	any	other	object	on	the	Master	by	clicking	it.	Unlike	the	title	and  object	area	placeholders,	any	text	that	you	type	in	other	Slide	Master	objects appears	exactly	as	you	type	it	on	each	slide.  Working	with	the	Slide	Master	and	Edit	Master tabs When	you	switch	to	Slide	Master	View,	an	entirely	new	tab	appears	on	the	Ribbon. This	new	tab	—	appropriately	called	Slide	Master	—	is	shown	in	Figure	10-2.  Figure	10-2:	The	Slide	Master	tab.  Throughout	this	chapter,	I	show	you	how	to	use	many	of	the	controls	on	this	tab.	For now,	here’s	a	quick	overview	of	each	group	on	this	tab	and	the	controls	found	in	them:   Edit	Master:	The	controls	in	this	group	let	you	edit	the	Slide	Master.	You	can	use the	Insert	Slide	Master	button	to	create	a	new	Slide	Master,	or	you	can	use	the Insert	Layout	button	to	add	a	new	layout	to	an	existing	Master.	You	can	also	use	the Delete	and	Rename	buttons	to	delete	or	rename	Masters	or	layouts.	For	information about	the	Preserve	button,	see	the	section	“Preserving	your	masters,”	later	in	this chapter. Master	Layout:	The	controls	in	this	group	let	you	edit	a	layout	by	adding	or removing	placeholders,	the	title,	and	footer	elements. Edit	Theme:	The	controls	in	this	group	let	you	apply	a	theme	to	a	Master	or	a layout.	For	more	information	about	themes,	flip	to	Chapter	8. Background:	The	controls	in	this	group	let	you	set	the	background	for	a	Master	or a	layout.	Refer	to	Chapter	8	for	more	information. Size:	The	control	in	this	group	lets	you	select	Standard,	Widescreen,	or	a	custom slide	size. Close:	This	group	contains	a	Close	Master	View	button	that	returns	you	to	Normal View.  Adding	recurring	text	or	other	elements To	add	recurring	text	to	each	slide,	follow	this	procedure:  1.	 Call	up	the	Slide	Master	 by	clicking	Slide	Master	in	the	Presentation	Views  group	of	the	Views	tab 	if	it’s	not	displayed	already.  2.	 Add	a	text	box	to	the	Slide	Master	by	selecting	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon  and	then	clicking	the	Text	Box	button	 found	in	the	Text	group . Click	where	you	want	to	add	the	text.  3.	 Type	the	text	that	you	want	to	appear	on	each	slide.  For	example,	Call	1-800-555-NERD	today!	Don’t	delay!	Operators	are	standing by!  4.	 Format	the	text	however	you	want.  For	example,	if	you	want	bold,	press	Ctrl+B	or	click	the	Bold	button	on	the Formatting	toolbar.	 See	Chapter	7	for	more	on	text	formatting.  5.	 Click	the	Normal	View	button	to	return	to	your	presentation.  Now’s	the	time	to	gloat	over	your	work.	Lasso	some	co-workers	and	show	’em	how proud	you	are	that	you	added	some	text	that	appears	on	each	slide	in	your presentation.  You	can	add	other	types	of	objects	to	the	Slide	Master,	too.	You	can	add	clip	art, pictures,	or	even	a	video	or	sound	clip.	Anything	that	you	can	add	to	an	individual	slide can	be	added	to	the	Slide	Master.   After	you	place	an	object	on	the	Slide	Master,	you	can	grab	it	with	the	mouse	and move	it	or	resize	it	in	any	way	you	want.	The	object	appears	in	the	same	location	and size	on	each	slide. To	delete	an	object	from	the	Slide	Master,	click	it	and	press	Delete.	To	delete	a	text object,	you	must	first	click	the	object	and	then	click	again	on	the	object	frame.	Then press	Delete. Applying	themes	to	your	Masters You	can	use	the	Edit	Theme	group	in	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to	change	the theme	applied	to	a	Slide	Master.	Note:	All	the	layouts	that	belong	to	a	given	Master	use the	same	theme.	So,	it	doesn’t	matter	whether	the	Slide	Master	itself	or	one	of	its layouts	is	selected	when	you	change	the	theme;	either	way,	the	entire	Slide	Master	is changed. To	change	the	theme	for	a	Slide	Master,	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Choose	View ⇒ Presentation	Views ⇒ Slide	Master	or	Shift+click	the	Normal  View	button	at	the	bottom	right	of	the	PowerPoint	window	to	summon	the Slide	Master.  2.	 Use	the	Themes	drop-down	list	on	the	Slide	Master	tab	to	select	the	theme	you  want	to	apply	to	the	Slide	Master.  3.	  Optional 	Use	the	Colors,	Fonts,	and	Effects	controls	to	modify	the	color  scheme,	fonts,	and	effects	used	for	the	theme. Treat	yourself	to	a	bag	of	Cheetos	if	it	works	the	first	time.	If	it	doesn’t	work,	have a	bag	of	Cheetos	anyway.	Then	rub	all	that	orange	gunk	that	sticks	to	your	fingers on	the	computer	screen.	That	will	apply	the	Cheetos	Orange	color	scheme	to	your Slide	Master	—	at	least	temporarily.  PowerPoint	themes	are	hefty	enough	that	I’ve	devoted	an	entire	chapter	to	them.	Go	to Chapter	8	if	you	need	to	know	how	they	work.  	If	you	want	to	adjust	the	slide	background,	use	the	Background	Styles	control.  Chapter	8	walks	you	through	this	feature. Adding	new	layouts If	you	don’t	like	the	standard	layouts	that	come	with	PowerPoint’s	built-in	Slide Master,	you	can	add	a	layout	and	customize	it	any	way	you	want.	To	add	your	own layout,	just	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Switch	to	Slide	Master	View	by	choosing	View ⇒ Presentation	Views ⇒ Slide Master	or	Shift+click	the	Normal	View	button	near	the	bottom	right	of	the   window.  2.	 On	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	Insert	Layout	in	the	Edit	Master  group. A	new,	blank	layout	is	inserted	in	the	current	Slide	Master.  3.	 Use	the	Insert	Placeholder	drop-down	list	in	the	Master	Layout	group	on	the Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to	insert	whatever	placeholders	you	want	to add	to	the	new	layout. This	control	reveals	a	list	of	placeholder	types	you	can	insert.	The	options	are Content,	Text,	Picture,	Chart,	Table,	Diagram,	Media,	and	Clip	Art.  4.	 Play	with	the	layout	until	you	get	it	just	right.  You	can	move	and	resize	the	placeholders	to	your	heart’s	content,	and	you	can apply	any	formatting	or	other	options	you	want	for	the	layout.  5.	 When	you’re	happy,	click	the	Close	Master	View	button	to	switch	back	to  Normal	View.   Adjusting	the	Handout	and	Notes	Masters  Like	the	Slide	Master,	the	Handout	and	Notes	Masters	contain	formatting	information that’s	applied	automatically	to	your	presentation.	This	section	tells	you	how	you	can modify	these	Masters. Changing	the	Handout	Master Follow	these	simple	steps	to	change	the	Handout	Master: 1.	 Choose	View ⇒ Presentation	Views ⇒ Handout	Master	or	hold	down	the	Shift  key	while	clicking	the	Slide	Sorter	View	button. The	Handout	Master	rears	its	ugly	head,	as	shown	in	Figure	10-3.	Notice	that	it includes	a	special	Handout	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon.  2.	 Mess	around	with	it.  The	Handout	Master	shows	the	arrangement	of	handouts	for	slides	printed	two, three,	four,	six,	or	nine	per	page,	plus	the	arrangement	for	printing	outlines.	You can	switch	among	these	different	handout	layouts	by	using	the	Slides-Per-Page control	in	the	Page	Setup	group	on	the	Handout	Master	tab. Unfortunately,	you	can’t	move,	resize,	or	delete	the	slide	and	outline	placeholders that	appear	in	the	Handout	Master.	You	can,	however,	add	or	change	elements	that you	want	to	appear	on	each	handout	page,	such	as	your	name	and	phone	number,	a page	number,	and	maybe	a	good	lawyer	joke.  3.	 Click	the	Close	Master	View	button	on	the	Handout	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon.  PowerPoint	returns	to	Normal	View.  4.	 Print	a	handout	to	see	whether	your	changes	worked.  Handout	Master	elements	are	invisible	until	you	print	them,	so	you	should	print	at least	one	handout	page	to	check	your	work.   Figure	10-3:	The	Handout	Master.  When	you	print	handout	pages,	the	slides	are	formatted	according	to	the	Slide	Master. You	can’t	change	the	appearance	of	the	slides	from	the	Handout	Master. Changing	the	Notes	Master Notes	pages	consist	of	a	reduced	image	of	the	slide,	plus	any	notes	that	you	type	to	go along	with	the	slide.	For	more	information	about	creating	and	using	Notes	Pages,	see Chapter	5. When	printed,	notes	pages	are	formatted	according	to	the	Notes	Master.	To	change	the Notes	Master,	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Choose	View ⇒ Presentation	Views ⇒ Notes	Master.  The	Notes	Master	comes	to	life,	as	shown	in	Figure	10-4.  2.	 Indulge	yourself.  The	Notes	Master	contains	two	main	placeholders	—	one	for	your	notes	and	the other	for	the	slide.	You	can	move	or	change	the	size	of	either	of	these	objects,	and you	can	change	the	format	of	the	text	in	the	notes	placeholder.	You	also	can	add	or change	elements	that	you	want	to	appear	on	each	handout	page.	Also	notice	the convenient	placement	of	the	header,	footer,	date,	and	page	number	blocks.  3.	 Click	the	Close	Master	View	button.  PowerPoint	returns	to	Normal	View.  4.	 Print	your	notes	to	see	whether	your	changes	worked.   Figure	10-4:	The	Notes	Master.  	At	the	very	least,	add	page	numbers	to	your	speaker	notes.	That	way,	if	you drop	a	stack	of	notes	pages,	you	can	use	the	page	numbers	to	quickly	sort	them back	into	order.  If	public	speaking	gives	you	severe	stomach	cramps,	add	the	text	“Just	picture	them naked”	to	the	Notes	Master.	It	works	every	time	for	me.   Using	Masters  You	don’t	have	to	do	anything	special	to	apply	the	formats	from	a	Master	to	your	slide; all	slides	automatically	pick	up	the	Master	format	unless	you	specify	otherwise.	So	this section	really	should	be	titled	“Not	Using	Masters”	because	it	talks	about	how	to	not use	the	formats	provided	by	Masters. Overriding	the	Master	text	style To	override	the	text	style	specified	by	a	Slide	Master,	simply	format	the	text	however you	want	while	you’re	working	in	Normal	View.	The	formatting	changes	you	make apply	only	to	the	selected	text.	The	Slide	Masters	aren’t	affected.  	The	only	way	to	change	one	of	the	Masters	is	to	do	it	directly	by	switching	to the	appropriate	Master	View.	Therefore,	any	formatting	changes	you	make	while in	Slide	View	affect	only	that	slide.  	If	you	change	the	layout	or	formatting	of	text	elements	on	a	slide	 for	example, if	you	move	the	title	placeholder	or	change	the	title	font 	and	then	decide	that	you liked	it	better	the	way	it	was,	you	can	quickly	reapply	the	text	style	from	the	Slide Master.	Right-click	the	slide	in	the	Slide	Preview	pane	 on	the	left	side	of	the screen 	and	then	choose	Reset	Slide	from	the	menu	that	appears.  Hiding	background	objects Slide	Masters	enable	you	to	add	background	objects	that	appear	on	every	slide	in	your presentation.	You	can,	however,	hide	the	background	objects	for	selected	slides.	You can	also	change	the	background	color	or	effect	used	for	an	individual	slide.	These	steps show	you	how:  1.	 Display	the	slide	that	you	want	to	show	with	a	plain	background. 2.	 Click	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	select	the	Hide	Background  Graphics	check	box	found	in	the	Background	group.  	Hiding	background	objects	or	changing	the	background	color	or	effect	applies  only	to	the	current	slide.	Other	slides	are	unaffected.  If	you	want	to	remove	some	but	not	all	the	background	objects	from	a	single	slide,	try this	trick:  1.	 Hide	the	background	graphics	from	the	slide.   To	hide	a	background	object,	choose	Design ⇒ Background ⇒ Hide	Background Objects.  2.	 Call	up	the	Slide	Master	by	choosing	View ⇒ Presentation	Views ⇒ Slide  3.	 Hold	down	the	Shift	key	and	then	click	each	of	the	background	objects	that  you	want	to	appear.  4.	 Press	Ctrl+C	to	copy	these	objects	to	the	Clipboard. 5.	 Return	to	Normal	View	by	clicking	the	Normal	button	at	the	bottom	of	the  Master.  screen.  6.	 Press	Ctrl+V	to	paste	the	objects	from	the	Clipboard. 7.	 Click	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Send	to	Back	button	 in  the	Arrange	group 	if	the	background	objects	obscure	other	slide	objects	or text.  	Note	that	if	you	paste	objects	in	this	way,	those	objects	are	no	longer	tied	to	the Slide	Master.	Thus,	if	you	later	change	the	objects	on	the	Slide	Master,	the	change won’t	be	reflected	on	the	slides	with	the	pasted	copies	of	the	objects.   Using	Headers	and	Footers  Headers	and	footers	provide	a	convenient	way	to	place	repeating	text	at	the	top	or bottom	of	each	slide,	handout,	or	notes	page.	You	can	add	the	time	and	date,	slide number	or	page	number,	or	any	other	information	that	you	want	to	appear	on	each	slide or	page,	such	as	your	name	or	the	title	of	your	presentation. The	PowerPoint	Slide	Masters	include	three	placeholders	for	such	information:  The	Date	area	can	be	used	to	display	a	date	and	time. The	Number	area	can	be	used	to	display	the	slide	number. The	Footer	area	can	be	used	to	display	any	text	that	you	want	to	see	on	each	slide.  	In	addition,	Handout	and	Notes	Masters	include	a	fourth	placeholder,	the  Header	area,	which	provides	an	additional	area	for	text	that	you	want	to	see	on each	page.  Although	the	Date,	Number,	and	Footer	areas	normally	appear	at	the	bottom	of	the slide	in	the	Slide	Masters,	you	can	move	them	to	the	top	by	switching	to	Slide	View	or Slide	Master	View	and	then	dragging	the	placeholders	to	the	top	of	the	slide. Adding	a	date,	number,	or	footer	to	slides To	add	a	date,	slide	number,	or	footer	to	your	slides,	follow	these	steps:  1.	  	Click	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Header	and  Footer	button	 found	in	the	Text	group . The	Header	and	Footer	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	10-5.	 If	necessary, click	the	Slide	tab	so	that	you	see	the	slide	footer	options	as	shown	in	the	figure.  2.	 To	display	the	date,	select	the	Date	and	Time	check	box.	Then	select	the	date format	that	you	want	in	the	list	box	beneath	the	Update	Automatically	radio button. Alternatively,	you	can	select	the	Fixed	radio	button	and	then	type	any	text	that	you want	in	the	Fixed	text	box.	The	text	that	you	type	appears	in	the	Date	area	of	the Slide	Master.  3.	 To	display	slide	numbers,	select	the	Slide	Number	check	box. 4.	 To	display	a	footer	on	each	slide,	select	the	Footer	check	box	and	then	type	the  text	that	you	want	to	appear	on	each	slide	in	the	Footer	text	box. For	example,	you	may	type	your	name,	your	company	name,	a	subliminal	message,   or	the	name	of	your	presentation.  5.	 If	you	want	the	date,	number,	and	footer	to	appear	on	every	slide	except	for  the	title	slide,	select	the	Don’t	Show	on	Title	Slide	check	box.  6.	 Click	Apply	to	All.  Figure	10-5:	The	Header	and	Footer	dialog	box.  	If	you’re	going	to	give	a	presentation	on	a	certain	date	in	the	future	 for  example,	at	a	sales	conference	or	a	trade	show ,	type	the	date	that	you’ll	be	giving the	presentation	directly	into	the	Fixed	text	box.	You	can	use	the	same	technique to	postdate	presentations	that	you	never	really	gave	but	need	to	supply	to	your legal	counsel	to	back	up	your	alibi.	 You	can	also	type	any	other	type	of	text	you want	to	appear	here.   If	you	want	to	change	the	Footer	areas	for	just	one	slide,	click	Apply	instead	of	Apply to	All.	This	option	comes	in	handy	for	those	occasional	slides	that	contain	a	graphic	or a	block	of	text	that	crowds	up	against	the	footer	areas.	You	can	easily	suppress	the footer	information	for	that	slide	to	make	room	for	the	large	graphic	or	text. Adding	a	header	or	footer	to	notes	or	handouts pages To	add	header	and	footer	information	to	notes	or	handouts	pages,	follow	the	steps described	in	the	preceding	section,	“Adding	a	date,	number,	or	footer	to	slides,”	except click	the	Notes	and	Handouts	tab	after	the	Header	and	Footer	dialog	box	appears. Clicking	this	tab	displays	a	dialog	box	that’s	similar	to	the	Header	and	Footer	dialog box	for	Slide,	except	that	it	gives	you	an	additional	option	to	add	a	header	that	appears   at	the	top	of	each	page.	After	you	indicate	how	you	want	to	print	the	Date,	Header, Number,	and	Footer	areas,	click	the	Apply	to	All	button. Editing	the	header	and	footer	placeholders	directly If	you	want,	you	can	edit	the	text	that	appears	in	the	header	and	footer	placeholders directly.	First,	display	the	appropriate	Master	—	Slide,	Handout,	or	Notes.	Then	click the	date,	number,	footer,	or	header	placeholder	and	start	typing. You	may	notice	that	the	placeholders	include	special	codes	for	the	options	that	you indicated	in	the	Header	and	Footer	dialog	box.	For	example,	the	date	placeholder	may contain	the	text	 	if	you	indicated	that	the	date	should	be	displayed.	You	can type	text	before	or	after	these	codes,	but	you	should	leave	the	codes	themselves	alone.   Yes,	You	Can	Serve	Two	Masters  In	spite	of	the	Biblical	edict,	Microsoft	has	endowed	PowerPoint	with	the	capability	to have	more	than	one	Slide	Master.	This	feature	lets	you	set	up	two	or	more	Slide Masters	and	then	choose	which	Master	you	want	to	use	for	each	slide	in	your presentation. The	following	sections	explain	how	to	use	the	multiple	Masters	feature. Creating	a	new	Slide	Master To	add	a	new	Master	to	a	presentation,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Switch	to	Slide	Master	View.  From	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Slide	Master	button	 found	in	the Presentation	Views	group .	Or	if	you	prefer,	hold	down	the	Shift	key	and	click	the Normal	View	button	near	the	lower-right	corner	of	the	screen.  2.	 In	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Insert	Slide	Master	button	in  the	Edit	Master	group. A	new	Slide	Master	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	10-6.	Notice	that	a	thumbnail	for the	new	Slide	Master	is	added	to	the	list	of	thumbnails	on	the	left	side	of	the	screen, and	that	the	new	Slide	Master	uses	PowerPoint’s	default	settings	 white background,	black	text,	and	so	forth .  3.	 Modify	the	new	Slide	Master	to	your	liking.  You	can	make	any	formatting	changes	you	want:	Change	the	background	color	and text	styles,	add	background	objects,	and	so	on.  4.	 Click	the	Close	Master	View	button	on	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to  return	to	Normal	View. You	can	now	begin	using	the	new	Master	that	you	created.	 See	the	next	section, “Applying	Masters,”	for	more	information.    Figure	10-6:	Creating	a	new	Slide	Master.  	Another	way	to	create	a	new	Slide	Master	is	to	duplicate	one	of	your  presentation’s	existing	Slide	Masters.	When	you	do	that,	the	new	Slide	Master inherits	the	formatting	of	the	original	one.	This	inheritance	can	save	you	a	lot	of work,	especially	if	you	want	to	create	a	new	Slide	Master	that	varies	from	an existing	one	in	only	a	minor	way,	such	as	having	a	different	background	color.  To	duplicate	a	Slide	Master,	click	the	Master	that	you	want	to	duplicate	in	the thumbnails	on	the	left	of	the	screen	and	then	press	Ctrl+D	or	right-click	the	thumbnail and	choose	Duplicate	Layout. To	delete	a	Slide	Master,	click	the	Master	that	you	want	to	delete.	Then	click	the	Delete Master	button	in	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon	 located	in	the	Edit	Master	group . Or,	just	press	Delete. Applying	Masters If	you	have	created	multiple	Masters	for	a	presentation,	you	can	select	which	Master	to use	for	each	slide	in	your	presentation.	To	apply	a	Master	to	one	or	more	slides,	follow these	steps:  1.	 Select	the	slide	or	slides	to	which	you	want	to	apply	the	alternate	Slide	Master. The	easiest	way	to	do	this	is	to	click	the	slide	that	you	want	in	the	thumbnails	area on	the	left	of	the	screen.	To	select	more	than	one	slide,	hold	down	the	Ctrl	key	and click	each	slide	that	you	want	to	select.  2.	 Click	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Layout	button	 in	the  Slides	group . This	action	summons	the	gallery,	shown	in	Figure	10-7.	Here,	you	can	see	all	the   layouts	for	all	the	Slide	Masters	contained	in	the	presentation.  3.	 Select	the	Slide	Master	layout	you	want	to	apply	to	the	slides	you	selected.  The	Slide	Master	is	applied	to	the	selected	slides.  Figure	10-7:	Choosing	a	layout.  Preserving	your	masters PowerPoint	has	a	bad	habit	of	deleting	Slide	Masters	when	they’re	no	longer	used	in your	presentation.	For	example,	if	you	create	a	new	Slide	Master	and	then	apply	it	to all	the	slides	in	your	presentation,	PowerPoint	assumes	that	you	no	longer	need	the original	Slide	Master.	So,	the	original	is	deleted.	Poof!	Your	presentation	is	now	one pickle	short	of	a	full	jar. You	can	prevent	this	from	happening	with	the	Preserve	Master	option	for	your	Slide Masters.	Any	new	Slide	Masters	that	you	create	automatically	get	the	Preserve	Master option,	so	they	won’t	be	deleted.	However,	the	Slide	Masters	that	your	presentations start	off	with	don’t	have	the	Preserve	Master	option,	so	you	may	want	to	set	it	yourself. To	preserve	a	Master,	switch	to	Slide	Master	View,	click	the	thumbnail	for	the	Master that	you	want	to	preserve,	and	then	click	the	Preserve	button	on	the	Slide	Master	tab	on the	Ribbon	 found	in	the	Edit	Master	group .	A	little	pushpin	icon	appears	next	to	the Master’s	thumbnail	to	show	that	the	Master	will	be	preserved.   	Don’t	click	the	Preserve	button	indiscriminately!	If	you	click	it	for	a	Master that	already	has	the	Preserve	Master	setting,	Preserve	Master	is	removed	for	that Master.	Then	the	Master	is	subject	to	premature	deletion.   Restoring	Lost	Placeholders  If	you’ve	played	around	with	your	Masters	too	much,	you	may	inadvertently	delete	a layout	placeholder	that	you	wish	you	could	get	back.	For	example,	suppose	that	you delete	the	footer	placeholder	from	a	Master	and	now	you	want	it	back.	No	problem! Just	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Switch	to	Slide	Master	View. 2.	 Call	up	the	Master	with	the	missing	placeholder. 3.	 In	the	Slide	Master	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Master	Layout	button	 in	the  Master	Layout	group . This	step	calls	up	the	Master	Layout	dialog	box,	as	shown	in	Figure	10-8.  	The	Master	Layout	dialog	box	is	one	of	the	strangest	dialog	boxes	you  encounter.	If	you	summon	it	for	a	Master	that	still	has	all	its	placeholders,	all	the check	boxes	on	the	Master	Layout	dialog	box	are	grayed	out.	So,	all	you	can	do	is look	at	the	controls,	grunt,	scratch	your	head,	and	then	click	OK	to	dismiss	the seemingly	useless	dialog	box.	However,	if	you	have	deleted	one	or	more placeholders,	the	check	boxes	for	the	missing	placeholders	are	available. 4.	 Select	the	check	boxes	for	the	placeholders	that	you	want	to	restore. 5.	 Click	OK.  The	missing	placeholders	reappear.  Figure	10-8:	The	Master	Layout	dialog	box.  	Note	that	the	preceding	procedure	works	only	for	actual	masters,	not	for  individual	layouts.	If	you	delete	a	placeholder	from	a	layout,	you	must	re-create	it by	using	the	Insert	Placeholder	command	as	described	in	the	section	“Adding	new layouts,”	earlier	in	this	chapter.   Working	with	Templates  If	you	had	to	create	every	presentation	from	scratch,	starting	with	a	blank	slide,	you would	probably	put	PowerPoint	back	in	its	box	and	use	it	as	a	bookend.	Creating	a presentation	is	easy,	but	creating	one	that	looks	good	is	a	different	story.	Making	a good-looking	presentation	is	tough	even	for	the	artistically	inclined.	For	left-brained, nonartistic	types,	it’s	next	to	impossible.  	Thank	heavens	for	themes	and	templates.	A	theme	is	simply	a	PowerPoint  presentation	with	predefined	Slide	Masters.	A	template	is	similar	to	a	theme,	but also	includes	boilerplate	text.	Because	they	are	so	similar,	I	refer	to	both	themes and	templates	simply	as	templates	throughout	the	rest	of	this	section.  Templates	jump-start	the	process	of	creating	good-looking	presentations.	You	can create	your	own	templates,	but	fortunately	PowerPoint	comes	with	a	ton	of	them designed	by	professional	artists	who	understand	color	combinations,	balance,	and	all that	other	artsy	stuff.	Have	a	croissant	and	celebrate. Templates	use	the	special	file	extension	.potx,	but	you	can	also	use	ordinary PowerPoint	presentation	files	 PPT 	as	themes	or	templates.	You	can,	therefore,	use any	of	your	own	presentations	as	a	template.	If	you	make	extensive	changes	to	a presentation’s	Masters,	you	can	use	that	presentation	as	a	template	for	other presentations	that	you	create.	Or,	you	can	save	the	presentation	as	a	template	by	using the	.potx	file	extension.  	Because	a	template	is	a	presentation,	you	can	open	it	and	change	it	if	you	want.  Creating	a	new	template If	none	of	the	templates	that	come	with	PowerPoint	appeals	to	you,	you	can	easily create	your	own.	All	you	have	to	do	is	create	a	presentation	with	the	Masters,	and	the color	scheme	set	up	just	the	way	you	want,	and	then	save	it	as	a	template.	Here	are	a few	points	to	remember	about	templates:  If	you	want	to	make	minor	modifications	to	one	of	the	supplied	templates,	open	the template	by	using	the	Open	command.	Then,	make	your	changes	and	use	the	Save As	command	to	save	the	template	under	a	new	name. You	can	also	create	your	own	presentation	templates.	Just	create	the	template	as	a normal	presentation	and	add	however	many	slides	that	you	want	to	include. Choose	a	location	to	store	all	your	templates.	You	need	to	know	the	path	to	this location	to	create	new	presentations	based	on	your	templates.   Creating	a	presentation	based	on	a	template To	create	a	new	presentation	based	on	a	template	you	have	created	yourself,	you	must first	configure	PowerPoint	to	look	for	personal	templates.	To	do	so,	choose	File ⇒  Options,	click	Save,	enter	the	path	to	your	templates	folder	in	the	Default	Personal Templates	Location	box,	and	click	OK. Once	you	have	configured	the	template	location,	you	can	create	a	new	presentation based	on	one	of	your	templates	by	choosing	File ⇒ New,	then	clicking	on	Personal	to display	a	list	of	your	personal	templates.	See	Figure	10-9.  Figure	10-9:	Creating	a	new	presentation.   Working	with	Presentation	Sections  Sections	let	you	divide	a	presentation	into	two	or	more	groups	of	slides	called	sections. Sections	are	designed	to	be	used	with	large	presentations	that	contain	a	large	number	of slides	that	can	easily	be	grouped	into	logical	groupings. Using	sections	couldn’t	be	easier.	To	create	a	new	section	in	your	presentation,	just select	the	first	slide	that	you	want	in	the	new	section,	switch	to	the	Home	tab,	click	the Section	button	 found	in	the	Slides	group ,	and	then	choose	Add	Section.	The	new section	appears	in	the	Slide	thumbnail	area	with	the	name	Untitled	Section,	as	shown	in Figure	10-10.  Figure	10-10:	Creating	a	new	section.  After	you’ve	created	one	or	more	sections	in	your	presentation,	you	can	do	several interesting	things	with	the	sections:  You	can	select	all	the	slides	in	a	section	by	clicking	the	section	header	in	the	Slide Thumbnail	pane. You	can	collapse	or	expand	the	sections	in	the	Slide	Thumbnail	pane	by	clicking the	arrow	at	the	left	of	the	section	header. You	can	rename	a	section	by	right-clicking	the	section	header	and	choosing Rename	Section. You	can	move	all	the	slides	in	a	section	by	dragging	the	section	header	to	a	new location	in	the	Slide	Thumbnail	pane. You	can	delete	the	slides	in	a	section,	as	well	as	the	section	itself,	by	clicking	the section	header	to	select	the	section	and	then	pressing	the	Delete	key. You	can	remove	a	section	without	deleting	its	slides	by	right-clicking	the	section header	and	choosing	Remove	Section. During	a	slide	show,	you	can	go	to	the	first	slide	in	any	section	by	clicking	the   Menu	icon	in	the	bottom-left	corner	of	the	slide,	then	choosing	Go	To	Section	and selecting	the	section	you	want	to	go	to.

Some	day	 soon, hopefully ,	the	genetic	researchers	combing	through	the	billions	and	billions	of	genes strung	out	on	those	twisty	DNA	helixes	will	discover	the	Artist	Gene.	Then,	in	spite	of protests	from	the	da	Vincis,	van	Goghs,	and	Monets	among	us	 who	fear	that	their	NEA grants	will	be	threatened ,	doctors	will	splice	the	little	gene	into	our	DNA	strands	so that	we	can	all	be	artists.	Of	course,	this	procedure	won’t	be	without	its	side	effects: Some	will	develop	an	insatiable	craving	for	croissants,	and	others	will	inexplicably develop	French	accents	and	whack	off	their	ears.	But	artists	we	shall	be. Until	then,	we	have	to	rely	on	clip	art	pictures,	pictures	we’ve	found	on	the	Internet,	or pictures	that	we	scanned	into	the	computer	with	a	scanner	or	took	with	a	digital camera.   In	this	chapter,	you	find	out	about	the	different	types	of	computer	pictures	and	how	you can	insert	them	into	a	PowerPoint	slide.	Then,	after	you	get	your	pictures	into PowerPoint,	you	discover	how	you	can	fiddle	with	them	to	get	them	to	look	better.   Exploring	the	Many	Types	of	Pictures  The	world	is	awash	with	many	different	picture	file	formats.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint works	with	almost	all	these	formats.	The	following	sections	describe	the	two	basic types	of	pictures	that	you	can	work	with	in	PowerPoint:	bitmap	pictures	and	vector drawings. Bitmap	pictures A	bitmap	picture	is	a	collection	of	small	dots	that	compose	an	image.	Bitmap	pictures are	most	often	used	for	photographs	and	for	icons	and	other	buttons	used	on	web	pages. You	can	create	your	own	bitmap	pictures	with	a	scanner,	a	digital	camera,	or	a	picture- drawing	program,	such	as	Adobe	Photoshop.	You	can	even	create	crude	bitmap pictures	with	Microsoft	Paint,	which	is	the	free	painting	program	that	comes	with Windows. The	dots	that	make	up	a	bitmap	picture	are	called	pixels.	The	number	of	pixels	in	a given	picture	depends	on	two	factors:	the	picture’s	resolution	and	its	size.	Resolution refers	to	the	number	of	pixels	per	inch.	A	typical	computer	monitor	displays	72	pixels per	inch,	though	many	monitors	can	display	at	higher	resolutions.	At	72	pixels	per inch,	a	1-inch	square	picture	requires	5,184	pixels	 72	x	72 .	Photographs	that	will	be printed	on	an	inkjet	or	laser	printer	usually	have	a	much	higher	resolution,	often	300 pixels	per	inch	or	more.	At	300	pixels	per	inch,	a	4-x-6-inch	photograph	requires	more than	two	million	pixels. The	amount	of	color	information	stored	for	the	picture	—	also	referred	to	as	the picture’s	color	depth	—	affects	how	many	bytes	of	computer	memory	the	picture requires.	The	color	depth	determines	how	many	different	colors	the	picture	can	contain. Most	pictures	have	one	of	two	color	depths:	256	colors	or	16.7	million	colors.	Most simple	charts,	diagrams,	cartoons,	and	other	types	of	clip	art	look	fine	at	256	colors. Photographs	usually	use	16.7	million	colors.  	Pictures	with	16.7	million	colors	are	also	known	as	True	Color	pictures	or	24-  bit	color	pictures.  A	4-x-6-inch	photograph,	which	has	more	than	2	million	pixels,	requires	about	2MB	to store	with	256	colors.	With	True	Color,	the	size	of	the	picture	jumps	to	a	whopping 6.4MB.	Fortunately,	bitmap	pictures	can	be	compressed	to	reduce	their	size	without noticeably	distorting	the	image.	Depending	on	the	actual	contents	of	the	picture,	a	6MB picture	might	be	reduced	to	250KB	or	less. Bitmap	picture	files	usually	have	filename	extensions	such	as	.bmp,	.gif,	.jpg,	.png,	or .pcx.	Table	11-1	lists	the	bitmap	file	formats	that	PowerPoint	supports. Table	11-1	PowerPoint’s	Bitmap	Picture	File	Formats   Format What	It	Is  BMP  Garden-variety	Windows	bitmap	file,	used	by	Windows	Paint	and	many	other	programs  GIF  Graphics	Interchange	Format,	a	format	commonly	used	for	small	Internet	pictures  JPEG  A	common	format	for	photographs	that	includes	built-in	compression  Macintosh	PICT	files  A	variant	type	of	bitmap	file  Targa	files  PCT  PCX  PNG  TGA  TIFF  Portable	Network	Graphics	file,	an	image	format	designed	for	Internet	graphics  Tagged	Image	Format	file,	another	bitmap	program	most	often	used	for	high-quality	photographs  	If	you	have	a	choice	in	the	matter,	I	recommend	you	use	JPEG	format	images  for	photographs	that	you	want	to	include	in	PowerPoint	presentations	because JPEG’s	built-in	compression	saves	hard	drive	space.  Victor,	give	me	a	vector Besides	bitmap	pictures,	you	can	also	use	vector	drawing	with	PowerPoint.	A	vector drawing	is	a	picture	file	that	contains	a	detailed	definition	of	each	shape	that	makes	up the	image.	Vector	drawings	are	usually	created	with	high-powered	drawing	programs, such	as	Adobe	Illustrator. PowerPoint	supports	all	the	most	popular	vector	drawing	formats,	as	described	in	Table 11-2. Table	11-2	PowerPoint’s	Vector	File	Formats  Format What	It	Is  EMF  An	Enhanced	Windows	MetaFile	picture  EMZ  A	compressed	version	of	the	EMF	format  EPS  Encapsulated	PostScript,	a	format	used	by	some	high-end	drawing	programs  WMF Windows	MetaFile,	a	format	that	many	programs	recognize	 note	that	WMF	files	can	hold	bitmap	as	well	as	vector	data   WPG  A	WordPerfect	drawing   Using	Pictures  Are	you	sitting	down?	Whether	you	buy	PowerPoint	by	itself	or	get	it	as	a	part	of Microsoft	Office,	you	also	get	access	to	an	online	collection	of	thousands	of	clip	art pictures	that	you	can	drop	directly	into	your	presentations.  	Don’t	overdo	the	pictures.	One	surefire	way	to	guarantee	an	amateurish	look	to  your	presentation	is	to	load	it	down	with	three	cheesy	clip	art	pictures	on	every slide.	Judicious	use	is	much	more	effective.  Dropping	in	a	picture The	following	steps	explain	how	to	insert	picture	art	into	your	presentation:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	plaster	the	picture.  If	you	want	the	same	picture	to	appear	on	every	slide,	move	to	Slide	Master	View.  2.	 On	the	Ribbon,	choose	Insert ⇒ Online	Pictures.  After	a	brief	moment’s	hesitation,	the	Insert	Pictures	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown in	Figure	11-1.  3.	 Type	a	keyword	in	the	Bing	Image	Search	text	box	and	then	press	Enter.  For	example,	to	search	for	pictures	of	William	Shakespeare,	type	Shakespeare	in the	text	box	and	then	press	Enter. PowerPoint	searches	Bing	to	locate	the	picture	you’re	looking	for,	and	then	it displays	thumbnails	of	the	pictures	it	finds,	as	shown	in	Figure	11-2.  4.	 Click	the	picture	that	you	want	to	use,	then	click	Insert.  The	picture	is	inserted	on	the	current	slide,	as	shown	in	Figure	11-3.	Notice	that	a special	Picture	Tools	tab	with	tools	for	working	with	pictures	has	appeared.	This Picture	Tools	tab	appears	whenever	you	select	a	picture	object.  	Note	that	some	of	the	images	displayed	by	Bing’s	image	search	may	be copyrighted,	so	make	sure	you	have	permission	from	the	copyright	holder	before using	images	found	on	Bing.  5.	 Drag	and	resize	the	picture	as	needed.  To	find	out	how,	see	the	following	section.   Figure	11-1:	The	Insert	Pictures	dialog	box.  Figure	11-2:	Bing	finds	several	pictures	of	William	Shakespeare.   Figure	11-3:	PowerPoint	inserts	the	picture	on	the	slide.  	If	your	picture	has	a	white	background,	like	the	one	in	Figure	11-3,	refer	to	the  “Removing	Picture	Backgrounds”	section,	later	in	this	chapter. Moving,	sizing,	and	stretching	pictures Because	PowerPoint	chooses	an	arbitrary	position	on	the	slide	to	insert	pictures,	you undoubtedly	want	to	move	the	clip	art	to	a	more	convenient	location.	You	probably also	want	to	change	the	size	of	the	picture	if	it’s	too	big	or	too	small	for	your	slide. Follow	these	steps	to	force	your	inserted	clip	art	into	full	compliance:  1.	 Click	the	picture	and	drag	it	wherever	you	want.  You	don’t	have	to	worry	about	clicking	exactly	the	edge	of	the	picture	or	one	of	its lines;	just	click	anywhere	in	the	picture	and	drag	it	around.  2.	 Notice	the	eight	handles.	Drag	one	of	them	to	resize	the	picture.  You	can	click	and	drag	any	of	these	handles	to	adjust	the	size	of	the	picture.	When you	click	one	of	the	corner	handles,	you	can	change	the	height	and	width	of	the picture	at	the	same	time.	When	you	drag	one	of	the	edge	handles	 top,	bottom,	left, or	right 	to	change	the	size	of	the	picture	in	just	one	dimension,	you	distort	the picture’s	outlook	as	you	go.  	When	you	resize	a	picture,	the	picture	changes	its	position	on	the	slide.	As	a result,	you	can	count	on	moving	it	after	you	resize	it.	If	you	hold	down	the	Ctrl key	while	dragging	a	handle,	however,	the	picture	becomes	anchored	at	its	center point	as	you	resize	it.	Therefore,	its	position	is	unchanged,	and	you	probably	don’t   have	to	move	it.  Stretching	a	clip	art	picture	by	dragging	one	of	the	edge	handles	can	dramatically change	the	picture’s	appearance.	For	example,	you	can	stretch	an	object	vertically	to make	it	look	tall	and	thin	or	horizontally	to	make	it	look	short	and	fat.   Inserting	Pictures	from	a	File  If	you	happen	to	already	have	an	image	file	on	your	computer	that	you	want	to	insert into	a	presentation,	PowerPoint	lets	you	insert	the	file.	These	steps	show	you	how:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	splash	a	picture. 2.	 Open	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Pictures	button	in	the  Images	group. This	step	summons	the	Insert	Picture	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	11-4.  3.	 Dig	through	the	bottom	of	your	hard	drive	until	you	find	the	file	that	you  want. The	picture	you	want	might	be	anywhere.	Fortunately,	the	Insert	Picture	dialog	box has	all	the	controls	you	need	to	search	high	and	low	until	you	find	the	file.	Just click	the	icons	at	the	left	side	of	the	box	and	you’re	halfway	there.  4.	 Click	the	file	and	then	click	Insert.  You’re	done!	Figure	11-5	shows	how	a	picture	appears	when	it	has	been	inserted	on a	slide.  Figure	11-4:	The	Insert	Picture	dialog	box.   Figure	11-5:	What	a	good	boy!  As	you	can	see	in	Figure	11-5,	PowerPoint	scales	your	pictures	so	that	they	fill	as	much of	the	slide	as	possible.	You	need	to	resize	the	picture	if	you	want	it	to	be	smaller.	Just select	the	picture	and	then	drag	one	of	the	size	handles	in	the	corner	of	the	picture.  	You	also	can	paste	a	picture	directly	into	PowerPoint	by	way	of	the	Clipboard. Anything	that	you	can	copy	to	the	Clipboard	can	be	pasted	into	PowerPoint.	For example,	you	can	doodle	a	sketch	in	Windows	Paint,	copy	it,	and	then	zap	over	to PowerPoint	and	paste	it.	Voilà	—	instant	picture!   Cropping	a	Picture  Sometimes	you	want	to	cut	off	the	edges	of	a	picture	so	that	you	can	include	just	part of	the	picture	in	your	presentation.	For	example,	you	might	have	a	picture	of	two people,	only	one	of	whom	you	like.	You	can	use	PowerPoint’s	cropping	feature	to	cut off	the	other	person.	 Note	that	you	can	crop	bitmap	images,	but	not	vector	pictures.  To	crop	a	picture,	select	the	picture	and	click	the	Crop	button	located	near	the	right	side of	the	Format	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	in	the	group	labeled	Size.	The	selection	handles change	to	special	crop	marks.	You	can	then	drag	the	crop	marks	around	to	cut	off	part of	the	picture.	When	you’re	satisfied,	press	the	Esc	key.	Figure	11-6	shows	the	picture that	was	inserted	in	Figure	11-5	after	it	has	been	cropped	and	resized.  Figure	11-6:	A	picture	that	has	been	cropped.  	If	you	decide	later	that	you	don’t	like	the	cropping,	you	can	right-click	the picture	and	choose	Format	Picture	from	the	menu	that	appears.	Then	click	the Reset	button.  	When	you	crop	a	picture,	the	picture	still	retains	a	basic	rectangular	shape.	If you	prefer	to	remove	the	background	from	an	irregular	shape	in	the	picture,	refer to	the	section	“Removing	Picture	Backgrounds,”	later	in	this	chapter.   Adding	Style	to	Your	Pictures  PowerPoint	enables	you	to	draw	attention	to	your	pictures	by	adding	stylistic	features such	as	borders,	shadows,	and	reflections.	Figure	11-7	shows	a	slide	with	several copies	of	a	picture,	each	with	a	different	style	applied.  Figure	11-7:	Pictures	with	style.  To	add	a	style	effect	to	a	picture,	select	the	picture	and	open	the	Picture	Tools	tab	on the	Ribbon.	Then,	simply	select	the	picture	style	you	want	to	apply. PowerPoint	comes	with	28	predefined	picture	styles,	shown	in	the	gallery	pictured	in Figure	11-8.	Each	of	these	styles	is	simply	a	combination	of	three	types	of	formatting you	can	apply	to	pictures:	Shape,	Border,	and	Effects.	If	you	want,	you	can	apply	these formats	individually	as	described	in	the	following	sections.  Figure	11-8:	The	Picture	Style	gallery.  Note	that	if	you	use	one	of	these	predefined	picture	styles,	the	picture	will	be	updated automatically	if	you	later	change	the	presentation’s	theme.	As	a	result,	you	should	use one	of	the	predefined	styles	whenever	possible.   Applying	a	picture	border You	can	apply	a	border	to	a	picture	by	opening	the	Picture	Tools ⇒ Format	tab	and clicking	Picture	Border	in	the	Picture	Styles	group.	This	reveals	the	Picture	Border menu,	which	lets	you	choose	the	border	color,	weight	 the	width	of	the	border	lines , and	the	pattern	of	dashes	you	want	to	use. Note	that	if	you	have	applied	a	shape	to	the	picture,	the	border	is	applied	to	the	shape. Applying	picture	effects The	Picture	Effects	button	in	the	Picture	Styles	group	 located	on	the	Format	tab 	lets you	apply	several	interesting	types	of	effects	to	your	pictures.	When	you	click	this button,	a	menu	with	the	following	effect	options	is	displayed:  Shadow:	Applies	a	shadow	to	the	picture.	You	can	select	one	of	several	predefined shadow	effects	or	call	up	a	dialog	box	that	lets	you	customize	the	shadow. Reflection:	Creates	a	reflected	image	of	the	picture	beneath	the	original	picture. Glow:	Adds	a	glowing	effect	around	the	edges	of	the	picture. Soft	Edges:	Softens	the	edges	of	the	picture. Bevel:	Creates	a	3-D	beveled	look. 3-D	Rotation:	Rotates	the	picture	in	a	way	that	creates	a	three-dimensional	effect.  	The	best	way	to	figure	out	how	to	use	these	effects	is	to	experiment	with	them  to	see	how	they	work.	Have	fun	and	go	crazy	…	but	remember	that	you	don’t need	to	share	the	results	of	your	experiments!   Correcting	Sharpness,	Brightness,	and Contrast  Sometimes,	in	spite	of	your	best	efforts,	your	pictures	just	don’t	come	out	quite	right. They	may	be	too	bright	or	too	dim,	faded	or	too	contrasty,	or	a	bit	out	of	focus. PowerPoint’s	new	Corrections	command	can	help	you	out	in	those	situations.	This command,	found	on	the	Picture	Tools	Format	tab,	lets	you	adjust	a	picture’s	sharpness, brightness,	and	contrast. To	change	a	picture’s	sharpness,	contrast,	or	brightness,	click	the	Corrections	button and	choose	one	of	the	preset	options	from	the	gallery	of	choices	that	appears.	Or, choose	the	Picture	Correction	Options	command	from	the	bottom	of	the	Corrections menu	to	reveal	the	Picture	Corrections	controls	in	the	task	pane	to	the	right	of	the	slide, as	shown	in	Figure	11-9.	You	can	use	these	controls	to	individually	adjust	the sharpness,	brightness,	and	contrast	adjustments.  Figure	11-9:	Setting	the	Picture	Corrections	options.   Adjusting	Color  The	Color	button	on	the	Picture	Tools	Format	tab	lets	you	adjust	the	color	of	your pictures.	You	can	adjust	the	following	aspects	of	a	picture’s	color:  Saturation:	Controls	the	overall	amount	of	color	in	the	picture Color	Tone:	Controls	the	overall	“warmth”	of	the	picture’s	color Recolor:	Lets	you	change	the	primary	color	visible	in	the	picture  To	change	a	picture’s	color,	click	the	Color	button	on	the	Picture	Tools	Format	tab	and choose	one	of	the	options	from	the	gallery	of	preset	choices.	Or,	choose	the	Picture Color	Options	command	at	the	bottom	of	the	Color	menu.	Doing	this	brings	up	the color	controls	shown	in	Figure	11-10.	As	you	can	see,	in	this	figure	I’ve	used	the	color controls	to	render	the	picture	in	black	and	white.  Figure	11-10:	Setting	the	Color	options	for	a	picture.   Applying	Artistic	Effects  The	Artistic	Effects	command	applies	one	of	several	special	filters	to	your	picture	in	an effort	to	make	the	picture	look	like	it	was	created	by	an	artist	rather	than	photographed with	a	$60	digital	camera.	Depending	on	the	nature	of	the	original	picture,	the	results may	or	may	not	be	convincing;	the	only	way	to	find	out	is	to	try. When	you	click	the	Artistic	Effects	button,	you’ll	see	a	preview	of	how	each	of	the available	effects	will	transform	the	selected	image.	Each	of	the	available	effects	has	a name,	which	you	can	see	by	hovering	the	mouse	over	the	preview	of	the	effect.	Here’s a	complete	list	of	the	effects	that	are	available:  Marker Pencil	Grayscale Pencil	Sketch Line	Drawing Chalk	Sketch Paint	Strokes Paint	Brush Glow	Diffused Blur Light	Screen Watercolor	Sponge Film	Grain Mosaic	Bubbles Glass Cement Texturizer Crisscross	Etching Pastels	Smooth Plastic	Wrap Cutout Photocopy Glow	Edges  To	apply	one	of	these	effects,	simply	double-click	the	picture,	click	the	Artistic	Effects button	on	the	Picture	Tools	Format	tab,	and	choose	the	effect	you	want	from	the gallery.   To	give	you	an	idea	of	what	these	effects	can	accomplish,	Figure	11-11	shows	how	the photograph	originally	shown	in	Figure	11-6	appears	with	the	Pencil	Sketch,	Watercolor Sponge,	and	Plastic	Wrap	filters	applied.  Figure	11-11:	Artistic	effects	can	dramatically	change	the	appearance	of	a	picture.   Compressing	Your	Pictures  Adding	pictures	to	your	slide	show	can	dramatically	increase	the	size	of	your presentation’s	file	on	disc.	This	is	especially	true	if	you	insert	a	bunch	of	pictures	taken with	a	modern	digital	camera.	For	example,	pictures	taken	with	digital	cameras	are often	half	a	megabyte	or	more	each.	Insert	50	such	pictures	into	your	slide	show	and the	file	will	grow	accordingly. However,	it	turns	out	that	the	amount	of	detail	contained	in	your	average	digital photograph	is	mostly	wasted	in	a	PowerPoint	slide	show.	That’s	because	digital cameras	are	designed	to	create	pictures	that	can	be	printed	on	high-resolution	printers. However,	most	computer	monitors	 and	projectors 	have	a	much	lower	resolution. To	compensate	for	this,	PowerPoint	includes	a	Compress	Pictures	command	that	can eliminate	the	extraneous	detail	in	your	images	and	thereby	reduce	the	size	of	your presentation	files.	To	save	even	more	space,	the	Compress	Pictures	command	also removes	any	parts	of	your	pictures	that	have	been	cropped. You	can	use	this	command	to	compress	just	a	single	picture	or	to	compress	all	the pictures	in	your	presentation	at	once.	I	recommend	that	you	compress	all	your	pictures by	following	these	steps:  1.	 Double-click	any	picture	in	the	presentation	to	bring	up	the	Picture	Tools  Format	tab. The	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	11-12	appears.  2.	 Deselect	the	Apply	Only	to	This	Picture	option.  If	you	leave	this	option	checked,	only	the	selected	picture	will	be	compressed. Deselect	this	option	to	compress	all	the	pictures	in	the	presentation.  3.	 Select	Screen	for	the	Target	Output	option.  This	step	sets	the	compression	so	that	image	quality	will	still	be	good	when	the pictures	are	displayed	on	a	computer	screen	or	projector.  4.	 Click	OK.  The	images	are	compressed.	Note	that	if	you	have	a	lot	of	pictures	in	your presentation,	this	step	may	take	a	few	moments.  5.	 Save	your	presentation.  The	images	won’t	actually	be	compressed	in	the	presentation	file	until	you	save	the file.   Figure	11-12:	Compressing	pictures.   Removing	Picture	Backgrounds  One	final	bit	of	picture	editing	wizardry	provided	by	PowerPoint	2016	is	the	capability to	remove	the	background	from	a	picture.	For	example,	Figure	11-13	shows	a	picture of	my	dog	Odie	with	the	background	removed.  Figure	11-13:	Odie	with	the	background	removed.  To	accomplish	this	bit	of	photo-editing	magic,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Double-click	the	picture	whose	background	you	want	to	remove. 2.	 Click	the	Remove	Background	button	in	the	Picture	Tools	Format	tab.  When	you	do,	PowerPoint	attempts	to	determine	which	part	of	your	picture	is	the subject	of	the	picture	and	which	part	is	the	background.	PowerPoint	creates	a bounding	rectangle	that	contains	what	it	believes	to	be	the	subject	of	the	picture. Then	it	analyzes	the	colors	in	the	picture	to	determine	what	it	believes	to	be	the background	portions	of	the	picture.	The	background	is	then	displayed	in	purple.	In addition,	a	special	Background	Removal	tab	appears	on	the	Ribbon. Figure	11-14	shows	PowerPoint’s	initial	attempt	at	removing	the	background	from the	picture	of	Odie.	As	you	can	see,	PowerPoint	has	found	most	of	Odie’s	head	but managed	to	cut	off	the	top	of	his	head,	his	nose,	and	his	right	eye.	The	result	is	a little	disconcerting.  3.	 Resize	the	bounding	rectangle	to	properly	enclose	the	subject.  Figure	11-15	shows	the	results	after	I	resized	the	bounding	rectangle	to	include	all of	Odie’s	head.  4.	 Use	the	Mark	Areas	to	Keep	and	Mark	Areas	to	Remove	buttons	to	refine	the  location	of	the	picture’s	background.   For	example,	if	an	area	that’s	part	of	the	subject	is	shown	as	background,	click	the Mark	Areas	to	Keep	button.	Then,	either	click	in	the	area	you	want	included	or click	and	drag	a	line	across	a	large	portion	of	the	area	to	be	included.	PowerPoint will	attempt	to	discern	which	part	of	the	picture	you	marked	and	include	that	area in	the	picture’s	subject. Similarly,	if	PowerPoint	has	mistaken	part	of	the	background	for	the	subject,	click the	Mark	Areas	to	Remove	button	and	click	or	draw	a	line	within	the	area	that should	be	removed. If	PowerPoint	misinterprets	your	mark,	press	Ctrl+Z	to	undo	your	action.	Or,	click the	Delete	Mark	button	and	then	click	the	mark	you	want	to	delete.  5.	 Repeat	Step	4	until	you’ve	successfully	removed	the	picture’s	background. 6.	 Click	the	Keep	Changes	button.  The	slide	returns	to	normal,	with	the	background	of	your	picture	removed.  Figure	11-14:	PowerPoint’s	initial	attempt	at	removing	the	background.   Figure	11-15:	Background	removal	after	resizing	the	bounding	rectangle.   Chapter	12   Drawing	on	Your	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Using	the	PowerPoint	drawing	tools 	Using	predefined	shapes 	Drawing	polygons	or	curved	lines 	Changing	colors	and	line	types 	Creating	3-D	objects 	Flipping	and	rotating	objects 	Using	advanced	tricks  Art	time!	Get	your	crayons	and	glue	and	don	an	old	paint	shirt.	You’re	going	to	cut	out some	simple	shapes	and	paste	them	on	your	PowerPoint	slides	so	that	people	either think	that	you’re	a	wonderful	artist	or	scoff	at	you	for	not	using	clip	art. This	chapter	covers	the	drawing	features	of	PowerPoint	2016.	Once	upon	a	time, PowerPoint	had	but	rudimentary	drawing	tools	—	the	equivalent	of	a	box	of	crayons	— but	PowerPoint	now	has	powerful	drawing	tools	that	are	sufficient	for	all	but	the	most sophisticated	aspiring	artists.   Some	General	Drawing	Tips  Before	getting	into	the	specifics	of	using	each	PowerPoint	drawing	tool,	the	following sections	describe	a	handful	of	general	tips	for	drawing	pictures. Zooming	in When	you	work	with	the	PowerPoint	drawing	tools,	you	might	want	to	increase	the zoom	factor	so	that	you	can	draw	more	accurately.	I	often	work	at	200,	300,	or	even 400	percent	when	I’m	drawing.	To	change	the	zoom	factor,	use	the	zoom	slider	located in	the	bottom-right	corner	of	the	screen.  	Before	you	change	the	zoom	factor	to	edit	an	object,	select	the	object	that	you want	to	edit.	This	way,	PowerPoint	zooms	in	on	that	area	of	the	slide.	If	you	don’t select	an	object	before	you	zoom	in,	you	might	need	to	scroll	around	to	find	the right	location.  Note	that	on	a	touchscreen	device,	you	can	zoom	in	and	out	by	using	a	two-fingered pinch	gesture.	And	on	a	device	with	a	mouse,	you	can	quickly	zoom	by	holding	down the	Ctrl	key	while	spinning	the	mouse	wheel. Displaying	the	ruler,	gridlines,	and	guides PowerPoint	provides	three	onscreen	features	that	can	help	you	line	up	your	drawings:  Ruler:	Horizontal	and	vertical	rulers	appear	at	the	top	and	to	the	left	of	the	slide. Gridlines:	A	grid	of	evenly	spaced	dots	appears	directly	on	the	slide. Guides:	A	pair	of	horizontal	and	vertical	lines	intersect	on	your	slide	like crosshairs	in	a	target.  You	can	activate	any	or	all	of	these	features	by	clicking	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and selecting	the	Ruler,	Gridlines,	or	Guides	check	box.	Figure	12-1	shows	PowerPoint with	the	rulers,	gridlines,	and	guides	displayed.   Figure	12-1:	PowerPoint	with	the	rulers,	gridlines,	and	guides	on.  When	you	work	with	drawing	objects,	the	ruler	is	positioned	so	that	zero	is	at	the middle	of	the	slide.	When	you	edit	a	text	object,	the	ruler	changes	to	a	text	ruler	that measures	from	the	margins	and	indicates	tab	positions. For	more	information	about	using	the	gridlines	or	guides,	see	the	section	“Using	the grids	and	guides,”	later	in	this	chapter. Sticking	to	the	color	scheme You	can	assign	individual	colors	to	each	object	that	you	draw,	but	the	purpose	of	the PowerPoint	color	schemes	 described	in	Chapter	8 	is	to	talk	you	out	of	doing	that.	If possible,	let	solid	objects	default	to	the	color	scheme’s	fill	color,	or,	if	you	must	change the	fill	color,	change	it	to	one	of	the	alternative	colors	provided	by	the	scheme.	The beauty	of	doing	this	is	that	if	you	change	the	color	scheme	later,	the	fill	color	for objects	changes	to	reflect	the	new	fill	color.	After	you	switch	to	a	color	that’s	not	in	the theme,	however,	the	object	ignores	any	subsequent	changes	to	the	theme. Saving	frequently Drawing	is	tedious	work.	You	don’t	want	to	spend	two	hours	working	on	a	particularly important	drawing	only	to	lose	it	all	just	because	a	comet	strikes	your	building	or	an errant	Scud	lands	in	your	backyard.	You	can	prevent	catastrophic	loss	from	incidents such	as	these	by	pressing	Ctrl+S	or	by	frequently	clicking	the	Save	button	as	you	work. And	always	wear	protective	eyewear. Remembering	Ctrl+Z  	In	my	opinion,	Ctrl+Z	—	the	ubiquitous	Undo	command	—	is	the	most  important	keyboard	shortcut	in	any	Windows	program,	and	PowerPoint	is	no   exception.	Remember	that	you’re	never	more	than	one	keystroke	away	from erasing	a	boo-boo.	If	you	do	something	silly	—	like	forgetting	to	group	a	complex picture	before	trying	to	move	it	—	you	can	always	press	Ctrl+Z	to	undo	your	last action.	Ctrl+Z	is	my	favorite	and	most	frequently	used	PowerPoint	key combination.	 For	left-handed	mouse	users,	Alt+Backspace	does	the	same	thing.  And	if	you	aren’t	ready	to	climb	on	a	chair	shrieking	at	the	first	sign	of	a	mouse, try	clicking	the	handy	Undo	button	on	the	Quick	Access	Toolbar.   Drawing	Simple	Objects  To	draw	an	object	on	a	slide,	first	call	up	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	Then	click	the Shapes	button	 located	in	the	Illustrations	group 	to	reveal	a	gallery	of	shapes	you	can choose	from,	as	shown	in	Figure	12-2.	Finally,	select	the	shape	you	want	to	draw	from the	Shapes	gallery.  Figure	12-2:	The	Shapes	gallery.  You	find	detailed	instructions	for	drawing	with	the	more	important	tools	in	the	Shapes gallery	in	the	following	sections.	Before	I	get	to	that,	though,	I	want	to	give	you	some pointers	to	keep	in	mind:  Choosing	a	location:	Before	you	draw	an	object,	move	to	the	slide	on	which	you want	to	draw	the	object.	If	you	want	the	object	to	appear	on	every	slide	in	the presentation,	display	the	Slide	Master	by	choosing	Slide	Master	in	the	Master Views	section	of	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon	or	by	Shift+clicking	the	Normal	View button.   	Fixing	a	mistake:	If	you	make	a	mistake	while	drawing	a	shape,	the	Undo command	on	the	Quick	Access	Toolbar	can	usually	correct	the	mistake	for	you. Holding	down	the	Shift	key:	If	you	hold	down	the	Shift	key	while	drawing	a shape,	PowerPoint	forces	the	shape	to	be	“regular.”	That	is,	rectangles	are	squares, ellipses	are	circles,	and	lines	are	constrained	to	horizontal	or	vertical,	or	45-degree diagonals.  Drawing	straight	lines You	can	use	the	Line	button	to	draw	straight	lines	on	your	slides.	Here’s	the	procedure:  	Click	the	Line	button	in	the	Shapes	group	on	the	Insert	tab.  1.	 2.	 Point	the	cursor	to	where	you	want	the	line	to	start. 3.	 Click	and	drag	the	cursor	to	where	you	want	the	line	to	end. 4.	 Release	the	mouse	button	when	you	reach	your	destination.  After	you’ve	drawn	the	shape,	the	Ribbon	displays	the	Drawing	Tools	tab,	as	shown	in Figure	12-3.	You	can	then	use	the	controls	in	the	Shape	Styles	group	to	change	the	fill, outline,	and	effects	applied	to	the	line.  Figure	12-3:	The	Format	tab	of	the	Drawing	Tools	ribbon.  	After	you’ve	drawn	a	line,	you	can	adjust	it	by	clicking	it	and	then	dragging  the	handles	that	appear	on	each	end	of	the	line.  Remember	that	you	can	force	a	line	to	be	perfectly	horizontal	or	vertical	by	holding down	the	Shift	key	while	you	draw.	If	you	hold	the	Shift	key	and	drag	diagonally	while you	draw	the	line,	the	line	will	be	constrained	to	perfect	45-degree	angles. Drawing	rectangles,	squares,	ovals,	and	circles To	draw	a	rectangle,	follow	these	steps:  1.	  	On	the	Insert	tab,	click	the	Shape	buttons	 in	the	Illustrations	group ,	then  click	the	Rectangle	button.  2.	 Point	the	cursor	to	where	you	want	one	corner	of	the	rectangle	to	be  3.	 Click	and	drag	to	where	you	want	the	opposite	corner	of	the	rectangle	to	be  positioned.  positioned.   4.	 Release	the	mouse	button.  The	steps	for	drawing	an	oval	are	the	same	as	the	steps	for	drawing	a	rectangle	except that	you	click	the	Oval	button	rather	than	the	Rectangle	button.	To	draw	a	square	or perfectly	round	circle,	select	the	Rectangle	button	or	the	Oval	button	but	hold	down	the Shift	key	while	you	draw.  	You	can	adjust	the	size	or	shape	of	a	rectangle	or	circle	by	clicking	it	and  dragging	any	of	its	love	handles	 the	small	circles	you	see	at	the	corners	of	the shape .   Creating	Other	Shapes  Rectangles	and	circles	aren’t	the	only	two	shapes	that	PowerPoint	can	draw automatically.	The	Shapes	gallery	includes	many	other	types	of	shapes	you	can	draw, such	as	pentagons,	stars,	and	flowchart	symbols. The	Shapes	gallery	 refer	to	Figure	12-2 	organizes	shapes	into	the	following categories:  Recently	Used	Shapes:	The	top	section	of	the	gallery	lists	as	many	as	24	of	the shapes	you’ve	used	most	recently.	The	shapes	found	in	this	section	change	each time	you	draw	a	new	shape. Lines:	Straight	lines,	curved	lines,	lines	with	arrowheads,	scribbly	lines,	and	free- form	shapes	that	can	become	polygons	if	you	want.	The	free-form	shape	is	useful enough	to	merit	its	own	section,	“Drawing	a	polygon	or	free-form	shape,”	later	in this	chapter. Rectangles:	Basic	rectangular	shapes,	including	not	just	a	regular	rectangle	but also	rectangles	with	corners	lopped	off. Basic	Shapes:	Squares,	rectangles,	triangles,	crosses,	happy	faces,	lightning	bolts, hearts,	clouds,	and	more. Block	Arrows:	Fat	arrows	pointing	in	various	directions. Equation	Shapes:	Shapes	for	drawing	simple	math	equations. Flowchart:	Various	flowcharting	symbols. Stars	and	Banners:	Shapes	that	add	sparkle	to	your	presentations. Callouts:	Text	boxes	and	speech	bubbles	like	those	used	in	comic	strips. Action	Buttons:	Buttons	that	you	can	add	to	your	slides	and	click	during	a	slide show	to	go	directly	to	another	slide	or	to	run	a	macro.  Drawing	a	shape The	following	steps	explain	how	to	draw	a	shape:  1.	 Click	the	Shapes	button	in	the	Illustrations	group	of	the	Insert	tab.  The	Shapes	gallery	appears.  2.	 Select	the	shape	you	want	to	insert.  When	you	select	one	of	the	shapes,	the	Shapes	gallery	disappears	and	PowerPoint is	poised	to	draw	the	shape	you	selected.  3.	 Click	the	slide	where	you	want	the	shape	to	appear	and	then	drag	the	shape	to  the	desired	size. Hold	down	the	Shift	key	while	drawing	the	Shape	to	create	an	evenly	proportioned   shape. When	you	release	the	mouse	button,	the	Shape	object	takes	on	the	current	fill	color and	line	style.  4.	  Optional 	Start	typing	if	you	want	the	shape	to	contain	text.  After	you’ve	typed	your	text,	you	can	use	PowerPoint’s	formatting	features	to change	its	typeface,	size,	color,	and	so	on.	For	more	information,	refer	to	Chapter	8.  Some	shapes	—	especially	the	stars	and	banners	—	cry	out	for	text.	Figure	12-4	shows how	you	can	use	a	star	shape	to	add	a	jazzy	burst	to	a	slide.  Figure	12-4:	Use	a	star	shape	to	make	your	presentation	look	like	a	late-night	infomercial.  You	can	change	an	object’s	shape	at	any	time.	First,	select	the	shape.	Then,	open	the Drawing	Tools	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	look	in	the	Insert	Shapes	group,	click	the	Edit	Shape button,	and	choose	Change	Shape	from	the	menu	that	appears.  	Many	shape	buttons	have	an	extra	handle	shaped	like	a	yellow	diamond	that  enables	you	to	adjust	some	aspect	of	the	object’s	shape.	For	example,	the	block	arrows have	a	handle	that	enables	you	to	increase	or	decrease	the	size	of	the	arrowhead.	The location	of	these	handles	varies	depending	on	the	shape	you’re	working	with.	Figure 12-5	shows	how	you	can	use	these	extra	handles	to	vary	the	shapes	produced	by	six different	shapes.	For	each	of	the	six	shapes,	the	first	object	shows	how	the	shape	is initially	drawn;	the	other	two	objects	drawn	with	each	shape	show	how	you	can	change the	shape	by	dragging	the	extra	handle.	 Note	that	the	yellow	handles	aren’t	shown	in this	figure.	When	you	select	a	shape	that	has	one	of	these	adjustment	handles,	the handles	will	appear.    Figure	12-5:	You	can	create	interesting	variations	by	grabbing	the	extra	handles	on	these	shapes.  Drawing	a	polygon	or	free-form	shape Mr.	Arnold,	my	seventh-grade	math	teacher,	taught	me	that	a	polygon	is	a	shape	that has	many	sides	and	has	nothing	to	do	with	having	more	than	one	spouse.	 One	is certainly	enough	for	most	people. 	Triangles,	squares,	and	rectangles	are	polygons,	but so	are	hexagons,	pentagons,	and	any	unusual	shapes	whose	sides	all	consist	of	straight lines.	Politicians	are	continually	inventing	new	polygons	when	they	revise	the boundaries	of	congressional	districts. One	of	the	most	useful	shapes	in	the	Shapes	gallery	is	the	Freeform	Shape	tool.	It’s designed	to	create	polygons,	but	with	a	twist:	Not	all	the	sides	have	to	be	straight	lines. The	Freeform	Shape	tool	lets	you	build	a	shape	whose	sides	are	a	mixture	of	straight lines	and	free-form	curves.	Figure	12-6	shows	three	examples	of	shapes	that	I	created with	the	Freeform	Shape	tool.   Figure	12-6:	Three	free-form	shapes.  Follow	these	steps	to	create	a	polygon	or	free-form	shape:  1.	  	Select	the	Freeform	shape	 shown	in	the	margin 	from	the	Shapes	gallery. You	can	find	the	Shapes	gallery	in	the	Shapes	group	on	the	Insert	tab.	When	you select	the	Freeform	Shape	tool,	the	cursor	changes	to	a	cross-hair	pointer.  2.	 Click	where	you	want	to	position	the	first	corner	of	the	object. 3.	 Click	where	you	want	to	position	the	second	corner	of	the	object. 4.	 Keep	clicking	wherever	you	want	to	position	a	corner. 5.	  Optional 	To	draw	a	free-form	side	on	the	shape,	hold	down	the	mouse	button when	you	click	a	corner	and	then	drag	to	draw	the	free-form	shape.	When	you get	to	the	end	of	the	free-form	side,	release	the	mouse	button. You	can	then	click	again	to	add	more	corners.	Shape	3	in	Figure	12-6	has	one	free- form	side.  6.	 To	finish	the	shape,	click	near	the	first	corner	—	the	one	that	you	created	in  Step	2. You	don’t	have	to	be	exact.	If	you	click	anywhere	near	the	first	corner	that	you	put down,	PowerPoint	assumes	that	the	shape	is	finished.  You’re	finished!	The	object	assumes	the	line	and	fill	color	from	the	slide’s	color scheme.  	You	can	reshape	a	polygon	or	free-form	shape	by	double-clicking	it	and	then   dragging	any	of	the	love	handles	that	appear	on	the	corners.  If	you	hold	down	the	Shift	key	while	you	draw	a	polygon,	the	sides	are	constrained	to 45-degree	angles.	Shape	2	in	Figure	12-6	was	drawn	in	this	manner.	How	about	a constitutional	amendment	requiring	Congress	to	use	the	Shift	key	when	it	redraws congressional	boundaries? You	also	can	use	the	Freeform	Shape	tool	to	draw	a	multisegmented	line	called	an	open shape.	To	draw	an	open	shape,	you	can	follow	the	steps	in	this	section,	except	that	you skip	Step	6.	Instead,	double-click	or	press	Esc	when	the	line	is	done. Drawing	a	curved	line	or	shape Another	useful	tool	is	the	Curve	Shape	tool,	which	lets	you	draw	curved	lines	or shapes.	Figure	12-7	shows	several	examples	of	curved	lines	and	shapes	drawn	with	the Curve	Shape	tool.  Figure	12-7:	Examples	of	curved	lines	and	shapes.  Here’s	the	procedure	for	drawing	a	curved	line	or	shape:  1.	  	Select	the	Curve	shape	tool	from	the	Shapes	gallery.  You	can	find	the	Shapes	gallery	in	the	Shapes	group	on	the	Insert	tab.	When	you select	this	tool,	the	cursor	changes	to	a	cross-hairs	pointer. 2.	 Click	where	you	want	the	curved	line	or	shape	to	begin. 3.	 Click	where	you	want	the	first	turn	in	the	curve	to	appear.  The	straight	line	turns	to	a	curved	line,	bent	around	the	point	where	you	clicked.	As you	move	the	mouse,	the	bend	of	the	curve	changes.  4.	 Click	to	add	turns	to	the	curve.   Each	time	you	click,	a	new	bend	is	added	to	the	line.	Keep	clicking	until	the	line	is as	twisty	as	you	want.  5.	 To	finish	a	line,	double-click	where	you	want	the	end	of	the	curved	line	to  appear.	To	create	a	closed	shape,	double-click	over	the	starting	point,	where you	clicked	in	Step	2.  Creating	a	text	box A	text	box	is	a	special	type	of	shape	that’s	designed	to	place	text	on	your	slides.	To create	a	text	box,	call	up	the	Insert	tab,	select	the	Text	Box	button	in	the	Text	group, and	then	click	where	you	want	one	corner	of	the	text	box	to	appear	and	drag	to	where you	want	the	opposite	corner,	just	like	you’re	drawing	a	rectangle.	When	you	release the	mouse	button,	you	can	type	text. You	can	format	the	text	that	you	type	in	the	text	box	by	highlighting	the	text	and	using the	usual	PowerPoint	text	formatting	features,	most	of	which	are	found	on	the	Home tab.	For	more	information	about	formatting	text,	see	Chapter	7. You	can	format	the	text	box	itself	by	using	Shape	Fill,	Shape	Outline,	Shape	Effects, and	other	tools	available	on	the	Drawing	Tools	tab,	as	described	in	the	next	section.	By default,	text	boxes	have	no	fill	or	line	color,	so	the	box	itself	is	invisible	on	the	slide	— only	the	text	is	visible.  	Most	shapes	also	function	as	text	boxes.	If	you	want	to	add	text	to	a	shape,	just  click	the	shape	and	start	typing.	The	text	appears	centered	over	the	shape.	 The only	shapes	that	don’t	accept	text	are	lines	and	connectors.    Styling	Your	Shapes  The	center	section	of	the	Drawing	Tools	tab	is	called	Shape	Styles.	It	lets	you	control various	stylistic	features	of	your	shapes.	For	example,	you	can	set	a	fill	color,	set	the outline,	and	add	effects	such	as	shadows	or	reflections. You	can	set	these	styles	individually,	or	you	can	choose	one	of	the	preselected	shape styles	that	appears	in	the	Shape	Styles	group.	Note	that	the	styles	that	appear	in	the Shape	Styles	group	vary	depending	on	the	type	of	shape	you’ve	selected	and	the	theme used	for	the	presentation.	For	example,	if	you	select	a	line,	various	predefined	line styles	are	displayed.	But	if	you	select	a	rectangle,	the	styles	appropriate	for	rectangles are	displayed. Setting	the	shape	fill The	Shape	Fill	control	 in	the	Shape	Styles	group	of	the	Drawing	Tools	tab 	lets	you control	how	shapes	are	filled.	The	simplest	type	of	fill	is	a	solid	color.	But	you	can	also use	a	picture,	a	gradient	fill,	or	a	texture	to	fill	the	shape.	You	can	also	use	a	handy Eyedropper	tool	that	lets	you	set	the	fill	of	the	selected	object	to	match	the	fill	of	any other	object. Selecting	solid	colors,	pictures,	gradients,	and	textures	for	shapes	is	similar	to	setting the	fill	for	backgrounds	and	themes.	For	more	information,	refer	to	Chapter	8. Setting	the	shape	outline The	Shape	Outline	control	 in	the	Shape	Styles	group	of	the	Drawing	Tools	tab 	lets you	change	the	style	of	line	objects	or	the	border	for	solid	shape	objects.	You	can change	the	following	settings	for	the	outline:  Color:	Sets	the	color	used	for	the	outline. Weight:	Sets	the	thickness	of	the	line. Dashes:	The	dashing	pattern	used	for	the	lines	that	outline	the	object.	The	default uses	a	solid	line,	but	different	patterns	are	available	to	create	dashed	lines. Arrows:	Lines	can	have	an	arrowhead	at	either	or	both	ends.	Arrowheads	are	used mostly	on	line	and	arc	objects.  For	maximum	control	over	the	outline	style,	choose	the	More	command	from	the	menu that	appears	when	you	click	the	Fill,	Outline,	or	Effects	button.	Doing	this	brings	up the	Format	Shape	task	pane	shown	in	Figure	12-8.	From	here,	you	can	control	all aspects	of	a	line’s	style:	its	color,	width,	dash	pattern,	and	cap	type	 various	arrowheads can	be	applied .   Figure	12-8:	Formatting	the	line	style.  Applying	shape	effects The	Shape	Effects	button	on	the	Drawing	Tools	tab	on	the	Ribbon	lets	you	apply several	interesting	types	of	effects	to	your	shapes.	When	you	click	this	button,	a	menu with	the	following	effect	options	is	displayed:  Shadow:	Applies	a	shadow	to	the	picture.	You	can	select	one	of	several	predefined shadow	effects,	or	you	can	call	up	a	dialog	box	that	lets	you	customize	the	shadow. Reflection:	Creates	a	reflected	image	of	the	picture	beneath	the	original	picture. Glow:	Adds	a	glowing	effect	around	the	edges	of	the	picture. Soft	Edges:	Softens	the	edges	of	the	picture. Bevel:	Creates	a	beveled	effect. 3-D	Rotation:	Rotates	the	picture	in	a	way	that	creates	a	three-dimensional	effect.   	The	best	way	to	discover	how	to	use	these	effects	is	to	experiment	with	them	to  see	how	they	work.   Flipping	and	Rotating	Objects  To	flip	an	object	means	to	create	a	mirror	image	of	it.	To	rotate	an	object	means	to	turn it	about	its	center.	PowerPoint	lets	you	flip	objects	horizontally	or	vertically,	rotate objects	in	90-degree	increments,	or	freely	rotate	an	object	to	any	angle.  	Rotation	works	for	text	boxes	and	Shape	text.	Therefore,	you	can	use	rotation to	create	vertical	text	or	text	skewed	to	any	angle	you	want.	However,	flipping	an object	doesn’t	affect	the	object’s	text.  Flipping	an	object PowerPoint	enables	you	to	flip	an	object	vertically	or	horizontally	to	create	a	mirror image	of	the	object.	To	flip	an	object,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Select	the	object	that	you	want	to	flip. 2.	 Open	the	Drawing	Tools	tab,	click	the	Rotate	button	on	the	Arrange	group,  and	then	choose	Flip	Horizontal	or	Flip	Vertical.  Rotating	an	object	90	degrees You	can	rotate	an	object	in	90-degree	increments	by	following	these	steps:  1.	 Choose	the	object	that	you	want	to	rotate. 2.	  	Open	the	Drawing	Tools	tab,	click	the	choose	Rotate	button	on	the  Arrange	group,	and	then	choose	Rotate	Right	or	Rotate	Left.  3.	 To	rotate	the	object	180	degrees,	click	the	appropriate	Rotate	button	again. Using	the	rotate	handle Remember	how	all	the	bad	guys’	hideouts	were	slanted	in	the	old	Batman	TV	show? The	rotate	handle	lets	you	give	your	drawings	that	same	kind	of	slant.	With	the	rotate handle,	you	can	rotate	an	object	to	any	arbitrary	angle	just	by	dragging	it	with	the mouse. The	rotate	handle	is	the	circular	handle	that	appears	when	you	select	an	object	that	can be	rotated.	The	rotate	handle	appears	above	the	object,	connected	to	the	object	by	a line,	as	shown	in	Figure	12-9.	You	can	rotate	an	object	to	any	angle	simply	by	dragging the	rotate	handle.   Figure	12-9:	The	rotate	handle	lets	you	rotate	an	object	to	any	arbitrary	angle.  The	following	steps	show	you	how	to	use	the	rotate	handle:  1.	 Click	the	object	that	you	want	to	rotate. 2.	 Drag	the	rotate	handle	in	the	direction	that	you	want	to	rotate	the	object. As	you	drag,	an	outline	of	the	object	rotates	around.	When	you	get	the	object’s outline	to	the	angle	you	want,	release	the	mouse	button,	and	the	object	is	redrawn	at the	new	angle.  	To	restrict	the	rotation	angle	to	15-degree	increments,	hold	the	Shift	key	while  dragging	around	the	rotation	handle.   Drawing	a	Complicated	Picture  When	you	add	more	than	one	object	to	a	slide,	you	might	run	into	several	problems. What	happens	when	the	objects	overlap?	How	do	you	line	up	objects	so	that	they	don’t look	like	they	were	thrown	at	the	slide	from	a	moving	car?	And	how	do	you	keep together	objects	that	belong	together? The	following	sections	show	you	how	to	use	PowerPoint	features	to	handle	overlapped objects	and	how	to	align	and	group	objects. Changing	layers Whenever	you	have	more	than	one	object	on	a	slide,	the	potential	exists	for	objects	to overlap	one	another.	Like	most	drawing	programs,	PowerPoint	handles	this	problem	by layering	objects	like	a	stack	of	plates.	The	first	object	that	you	draw	is	at	the	bottom	of the	stack;	the	second	object	is	on	top	of	the	first;	the	third	is	atop	the	second	object;	and so	on.	If	two	objects	overlap,	the	one	that’s	at	the	highest	layer	wins;	objects	below	it are	partially	covered.	 Note	that	PowerPoint’s	layers	aren’t	nearly	as	powerful	as	layers in	other	programs,	such	as	Adobe	Illustrator	or	AutoCAD.	All	they	really	do	is	set	the stacking	order	when	objects	are	placed	on	top	of	one	another.  So	far,	so	good	—	but	what	if	you	don’t	remember	to	draw	the	objects	in	the	correct order?	What	if	you	draw	a	shape	that	you	want	to	tuck	behind	a	shape	that	you’ve already	drawn,	or	what	if	you	want	to	bring	an	existing	shape	to	the	top	of	the	pecking order?	No	problem.	PowerPoint	enables	you	to	change	the	stacking	order	by	moving objects	toward	the	front	or	back	so	that	they	overlap	just	the	way	you	want. The	Drawing	Tools	tab	provides	two	controls	that	let	you	move	an	object	forward	or backward	in	the	layer	order:  Bring	to	Front:	Brings	the	chosen	object	to	the	top	of	the	stack.	Note	that	this button	has	a	down	arrow	next	to	it.	If	you	click	this	down	arrow,	you	reveal	a	menu with	two	subcommands:	Bring	to	Front	and	Bring	Forward.	The	Bring	Forward command	moves	the	object	just	one	step	closer	to	the	top	of	the	heap,	whereas	the Bring	to	Front	command	moves	the	object	all	the	way	to	the	top. Send	to	Back:	Sends	the	chosen	object	to	the	back	of	the	stack.	Again,	this	button has	a	down	arrow	next	to	it.	You	can	click	this	down	arrow	to	access	the	Send Backward	subcommand,	which	sends	the	object	one	level	down	in	the	layer	order.  Layering	problems	are	most	obvious	when	objects	have	a	fill	color.	If	an	object	has	no fill	color,	objects	behind	it	are	allowed	to	show	through.	In	this	case,	the	layering doesn’t	matter	much. To	bring	an	object	to	the	top	of	another,	you	might	have	to	use	the	Bring	Forward command	several	times.	The	reason	is	that	even	though	the	two	objects	appear	to	be adjacent,	other	objects	might	occupy	the	layers	between	them.   Line	’em	up Nothing	looks	more	amateurish	than	objects	dropped	randomly	on	a	slide	with	no apparent	concern	for	how	they	line	up	with	each	other.	The	Drawing	Tools	tab	includes an	Align	button	that	brings	up	a	menu	with	the	following	commands:  Align	Left Align	Center Align	Right Align	Top Align	Middle Align	Bottom Distribute	Horizontally Distribute	Vertically  The	first	three	commands	 Align	Left,	Center,	and	Right 	align	items	horizontally;	the next	three	commands	 Align	Top,	Middle,	and	Bottom 	align	items	vertically. You	can	also	distribute	several	items	so	that	they’re	spaced	evenly.	Select	the	items	that you	want	to	distribute,	click	the	Draw	button,	choose	Align	or	Distribute,	and	then choose	Distribute	Horizontally	or	Distribute	Vertically.	PowerPoint	then	adjusts	the spacing	of	the	objects	that	appear	between	the	two	outermost	objects	selected.  	Another	quick	way	to	align	one	item	to	another	is	to	simply	drag	the	first	item  until	it	is	close	to	the	alignment	you	want.	When	the	item	reaches	the	correct alignment,	a	magic	guideline	will	appear	to	indicate	that	you	have	found	the correct	alignment.	If	you	release	the	mouse	button	while	this	magic	guideline	is visible,	the	object	will	be	snapped	into	alignment.  Using	the	grids	and	guides To	help	you	create	well-ordered	slides,	PowerPoint	lets	you	display	a	grid	of	evenly spaced	lines	over	the	slide.	These	lines	aren’t	actually	a	part	of	the	slide,	so	your audience	won’t	see	them	when	you	give	your	presentation.	They	exist	simply	to	make the	task	of	lining	things	up	a	bit	easier. In	addition	to	the	grid,	PowerPoint	also	lets	you	use	guides.	The	guides	are	two	lines	— one	horizontal,	the	other	vertical	—	that	appear	onscreen.	Although	the	gridlines	are fixed	in	their	location	on	your	slides,	you	can	move	the	guides	around	as	you	want. Any	object	that	comes	within	a	pixel’s	breadth	of	one	of	these	guidelines	snaps	to	it. Like	the	grid,	the	guides	don’t	show	up	when	you	give	your	presentation.	They	appear only	when	you’re	editing	your	slides.	Guides	are	a	great	way	to	line	up	objects	in	a	neat   row. To	display	the	grid	or	guides,	click	the	dialog	box	launcher	in	the	bottom-right	corner of	the	Show	section	of	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	This	click	summons	the	Grid	and Guides	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	12-10.  Figure	12-10:	The	Grid	and	Guides	dialog	box.  To	activate	the	grid,	select	the	Snap	Objects	to	Grid	check	box	and	then	adjust	the	grid spacing	to	whatever	setting	you	want.	If	you	want	to	actually	see	the	grid	onscreen, select	the	Display	Grid	on	Screen	check	box. To	fire	up	the	guides,	select	the	Display	Drawing	Guides	on	Screen	check	box.	After the	guides	are	visible,	you	can	move	them	around	the	slide	by	clicking	and	dragging them. You	can	also	deselect	Display	Smart	Guides	When	Shapes	Are	Aligned	to	disable	the guidelines	that	appear	when	you	move	shapes	into	alignment	with	each	other.	This	is	a useful	feature,	however;	I	recommend	that	you	leave	this	option	selected. Group	therapy A	group	is	a	collection	of	objects	that	PowerPoint	treats	as	though	they	were	one object.	Using	groups	properly	is	one	key	to	putting	simple	shapes	together	to	make complex	pictures	without	becoming	so	frustrated	that	you	have	to	join	a	therapy	group.  “Hello,	my	name	is	Doug,	and	PowerPoint	drives	me	crazy.”  To	create	a	group,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Choose	all	objects	that	you	want	to	include	in	the	group.  You	can	do	this	by	holding	down	the	Shift	key	and	clicking	each	of	the	items	or	by clicking	and	dragging	the	resulting	rectangle	around	all	the	items.  2.	 Right-click	one	of	the	selected	objects	and	then	choose	Group ⇒ Group	from  the	menu	that	appears.  You	can	also	find	the	Group	command	on	the	Drawing	Tools	tab,	but	it’s	much	easier to	find	by	right-clicking.   To	take	a	group	apart	so	that	PowerPoint	treats	the	objects	as	individuals	again,	follow these	steps:  1.	 Right-click	the	group	you	want	to	break	up. 2.	 Choose	Group ⇒ Ungroup.  If	you	create	a	group	and	then	ungroup	it	so	that	you	can	work	on	its	elements individually,	you	can	easily	regroup	the	objects.	These	steps	show	you	how:  1.	 Right-click	one	of	the	objects	that	was	in	the	original	group. 2.	 Choose	Group ⇒ Regroup.  PowerPoint	remembers	which	objects	were	in	the	group	and	automatically	includes them.  PowerPoint	enables	you	to	create	groups	of	groups.	This	capability	is	useful	for complex	pictures	because	it	enables	you	to	work	on	one	part	of	the	picture,	group	it, and	then	work	on	the	next	part	of	the	picture	without	worrying	about	accidentally disturbing	the	part	that	you’ve	already	grouped.	After	you	have	several	such	groups, select	them	and	group	them.	You	can	create	groups	of	groups	of	groups	and	so	on,	ad nauseam.   Chapter	13   Charting	for	Fun	and	Profit  In	This	Chapter  	Adding	a	chart	to	your	presentation 	Getting	data	from	other	programs 	Editing	the	data	in	your	chart 	Embellishing	your	chart	with	titles,	legends,	and	other	stuff  One	of	the	best	ways	to	prove	a	point	is	with	numbers,	and	one	of	the	best	ways	to present	numbers	is	in	a	chart.	With	PowerPoint,	adding	a	chart	to	your	presentation	is easy.	And	getting	the	chart	to	look	the	way	you	want	is	usually	easy,	too.	It	takes	a	little bit	of	pointing	and	clicking,	but	it	works.	This	chapter	shows	you	how.   Understanding	Charts  If	you’ve	never	attempted	to	add	a	chart	to	a	slide,	the	process	can	be	a	little	confusing. A	chart	is	simply	a	series	of	numbers	rendered	as	a	graph.	You	can	supply	the	numbers yourself,	or	you	can	copy	them	from	a	separate	file,	such	as	an	Excel	spreadsheet.	You can	create	all	kinds	of	different	charts,	ranging	from	simple	bar	charts	and	pie	charts	to exotic	doughnut	charts	and	radar	charts.	Very	cool,	but	a	little	confusing	to	the uninitiated.  The	following	list	details	some	of	the	jargon	that	you	have	to	contend	with	when	you’re working	with	charts:  Graph	or	chart:	Same	thing.	These	terms	are	used	interchangeably.	A	graph	or chart	is	nothing	more	than	a	bunch	of	numbers	turned	into	a	picture.	After	all,	a picture	is	worth	a	thousand	numbers. Chart	type:	PowerPoint	supports	several	chart	types:	bar	charts,	column	charts,	pie charts,	line	charts,	scatter	charts,	area	charts,	radar	charts,	Dunkin’	Donut	charts, and	others.	You	can	even	create	cone	charts	that	look	like	something	that	fell	off	a Fembot	in	an	Austin	Powers	movie.	Different	types	of	charts	are	better	suited	to displaying	different	types	of	data. Chart	Layout:	A	predefined	combination	of	chart	elements,	such	as	headings	and legends,	that	lets	you	easily	create	a	common	type	of	chart. Chart	Style:	A	predefined	combination	of	formatting	elements	that	controls	the   visual	appearance	of	a	chart. Datasheet:	Supplies	the	underlying	data	for	a	chart.	After	all,	a	chart	is	nothing more	than	a	bunch	of	numbers	made	into	a	picture.	Those	numbers	come	from	the datasheet,	which	is	actually	an	Excel	spreadsheet.	When	you	create	a	chart, PowerPoint	automatically	starts	Excel	 if	it	isn’t	already	running 	and	uses	Excel	to hold	the	numbers	in	the	datasheet. Series:	A	collection	of	related	numbers.	For	example,	a	chart	of	quarterly	sales	by region	might	have	a	series	for	each	region.	Each	series	has	four	sales	totals,	one	for each	quarter.	Each	series	is	usually	represented	by	a	row	on	the	datasheet,	but	you can	change	the	datasheet	so	that	each	column	represents	a	series.	Most	chart	types can	plot	more	than	one	series.	Pie	charts	can	plot	only	one	series	at	a	time, however.	The	name	of	each	series	can	be	displayed	in	a	legend. Axes:	The	lines	on	the	edges	of	a	chart.	The	X-axis	is	the	line	along	the	bottom	of the	chart;	the	Y-axis	is	the	line	along	the	left	edge	of	the	chart.	The	X-axis	usually indicates	categories.	Actual	data	values	are	plotted	along	the	Y-axis.	Microsoft Graph	automatically	provides	labels	for	the	X-	and	Y-axes,	but	you	can	change them. Legend:	A	box	used	to	identify	the	various	series	plotted	on	the	chart.	PowerPoint can	create	a	legend	automatically	if	you	want	one.  	The	most	interesting	thing	to	know	about	charting	in	PowerPoint	2016	is	that	it  is	closely	integrated	with	Excel	2016.	When	you	insert	a	chart	in	PowerPoint, Excel	is	automatically	started,	and	the	data	that	you	chart	is	placed	in	an	Excel workbook.	However,	that	Excel	workbook	isn’t	stored	as	a	separate	document. Instead,	the	chart	and	the	datasheet	workbook	are	stored	within	the	PowerPoint document.   Adding	a	Chart	to	Your	Presentation  To	add	a	chart	to	your	presentation,	you	have	several	options:  Create	a	new	slide	by	using	a	layout	that	includes	a	Content	placeholder	 an	object that	reserves	space	for	content	on	the	slide .	Then	click	the	Chart	icon	in	the Content	placeholder	to	create	the	chart. Use	the	Insert	tab	to	insert	a	chart	into	any	slide. Create	the	chart	separately	in	Microsoft	Excel	and	then	paste	the	chart	into PowerPoint.	This	is	the	most	common	method	if	the	chart	is	based	on	data	that’s already	stored	in	an	Excel	workbook.  Adding	a	new	slide	with	a	chart The	following	procedure	shows	how	to	insert	a	new	slide	that	contains	a	chart:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	that	you	want	the	new	slide	to	follow. 2.	 Click	the	Home	tab	and	then	click	the	New	Slide	button	in	the	Slides	group.  This	action	reveals	a	list	of	slide	layouts.  3.	 Click	one	of	the	slide	layouts	that	includes	a	Content	placeholder.  Several	slide	types	include	a	Content	placeholder.	When	you	click	the	one	you want,	a	slide	with	the	selected	layout	is	added	to	your	presentation,	as	shown	in Figure	13-1.	 In	this	case,	I	chose	the	“Title	and	Content”	layout.  As	you	can	see,	the	Content	placeholder	includes	six	little	icons	for	inserting different	types	of	content:  	Table:	Inserts	a	table,	as	described	in	Chapter	16.  	Chart:	Inserts	a	chart.  	SmartArt:	Inserts	a	SmartArt	graphic,	as	described	in	Chapter	14.  	Picture:	Inserts	a	picture,	as	described	in	Chapter	11.  	Online	Picture:	Inserts	a	picture	from	an	online	source,	as	described	in  Chapter	11.  	Media:	Inserts	a	movie,	as	described	in	Chapter	15.  4.	 Click	the	Chart	icon	in	the	middle	of	the	Content	placeholder.  The	Chart	icon	is	the	one	in	the	middle	of	the	top	row	of	icons.	Clicking	this	icon summons	the	Insert	Chart	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	13-2.   5.	 Select	the	type	of	chart	you	want	to	create.  You	can	select	any	of	the	following	chart	types:  Column:	Data	is	shown	as	vertical	columns.	The	columns	can	be	displayed side	by	side	or	stacked,	and	you	can	pick	various	shapes	for	the	columns, including	simple	bars,	3-D	blocks,	cylinders,	cones,	and	pyramids. Line:	The	data	is	shown	as	individual	points	linked	by	various	types	of	lines. Pie:	The	data	is	shown	as	slices	in	a	circular	pie. Bar:	The	same	as	a	column	chart,	except	the	columns	are	laid	out horizontally	instead	of	vertically. Area:	Similar	to	a	line	chart,	but	the	areas	beneath	the	lines	are	shaded. X	Y	 Scatter :	Plots	individual	points	using	two	values	to	represent	the	X,	Y coordinates. Stock:	Plots	high low close	values. Surface:	Similar	to	a	line	chart	but	represents	the	data	as	a	three-dimensional surface. Radar:	Plots	data	relative	to	a	central	point	rather	than	to	X,	Y	axes. Combo:	Lets	you	combine	different	chart	types	in	a	single	chart.  6.	 Click	OK.  PowerPoint	whirs	and	grinds	for	a	moment	and	then	inserts	the	chart	into	the	slide, as	shown	in	Figure	13-3.	The	reason	for	all	the	commotion	is	that	to	insert	the chart,	PowerPoint	must	find	out	whether	Excel	is	already	running.	If	not, PowerPoint	launches	Excel,	as	you	can	see	in	the	figure. 7.	 Change	the	sample	data	to	something	more	realistic.  As	you	can	see,	the	data	for	the	chart	is	shown	in	a	separate	spreadsheet	window that	resembles	Excel,	tiled	alongside	PowerPoint.	You	need	to	edit	the	data	in	this spreadsheet	to	provide	the	data	you	want	to	chart.	Notice	that	any	changes	you make	to	the	spreadsheet	data	are	automatically	reflected	in	the	chart. For	more	information,	turn	to	the	section	“Working	with	Chart	Data,”	later	in	this chapter.  8.	 Customize	the	chart	any	way	you	want.  For	example,	you	can	change	the	chart	layout	or	style,	as	described	later	in	this chapter.	Figure	13-4	shows	a	finished	chart.   Figure	13-1:	A	slide	with	a	content	placeholder.  Figure	13-2:	The	Insert	Chart	dialog	box.   Figure	13-3:	A	chart	after	it	has	been	inserted	into	PowerPoint.  Figure	13-4:	A	slide	with	a	finished	chart.  Adding	a	chart	to	an	existing	slide If	you	prefer,	you	can	add	a	chart	to	an	existing	slide	by	following	these	steps:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	place	the	chart. 2.	 Activate	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	Click	the	Chart	button	in	the  Illustrations	group. This	step	summons	the	Insert	Chart	dialog	box	 refer	to	Figure	13-2 .  3.	 Select	the	type	of	chart	you	want	to	create	and	then	click	OK.  PowerPoint	launches	Excel	 if	it	isn’t	already	running 	and	inserts	a	chart	based	on sample	data.   See	the	section	“Changing	the	Chart	Type,”	later	in	this	chapter,	for	more information	about	chart	types.  4.	 Change	the	sample	data	to	something	more	realistic.  For	more	information	about	working	with	chart	data,	check	out	the	section “Working	with	Chart	Data,”	later	in	this	chapter.  5.	 Finish	the	chart	by	setting	the	chart	layout	and	style.  For	more	information,	see	the	sections	“Changing	the	Chart	Layout”	and “Changing	the	Chart	Style,”	later	in	this	chapter.  6.	 Rearrange	everything.  The	chart	undoubtedly	falls	on	top	of	something	else	already	on	the	slide.	You probably	need	to	resize	the	chart	by	selecting	it	and	then	dragging	it	by	the	love handles.	You	can	move	the	chart	like	any	other	object:	Just	click	and	drag	it	to	a new	location.	You	might	also	need	to	move,	resize,	or	delete	other	objects	to	make room	for	the	chart	or	change	the	layer	order	of	the	chart	or	other	surrounding objects.	You	can	find	information	about	these	manipulations	in	Chapters	11	and	12.  Pasting	a	chart	from	Excel If	the	data	you	want	to	chart	already	exists	in	an	Excel	workbook,	the	easiest	way	to chart	it	in	PowerPoint	is	to	first	create	the	chart	in	Excel.	Then	copy	the	chart	to	the clipboard,	switch	over	to	PowerPoint,	and	paste	the	chart	to	the	appropriate	slide. When	you	do	so,	the	chart	appears	in	PowerPoint	exactly	as	it	did	in	Excel. When	you	paste	an	Excel	chart	into	PowerPoint,	a	smart	tag	appears	near	the	bottom right	of	the	chart.	You	can	click	this	smart	tag	to	reveal	a	menu	that	lets	you	indicate whether	you	want	to	keep	the	original	formatting	of	the	chart	or	use	the	theme	in	the PowerPoint	presentation. In	addition,	the	smart	tag	lets	you	indicate	whether	the	chart	should	be	embedded	or linked.	If	you	embed	the	chart,	PowerPoint	creates	a	copy	of	the	Excel	data	and	stores it	as	a	workbook	object	within	your	PowerPoint	file.	This	effectively	severs	the	chart	in the	PowerPoint	presentation	from	the	original	workbook,	so	any	changes	you	make	to the	data	in	the	original	workbook	aren’t	reflected	in	the	PowerPoint	chart. On	the	other	hand,	if	you	link	the	chart,	PowerPoint	copies	the	chart	into	the PowerPoint	presentation	but	creates	a	link	to	the	data	in	the	original	Excel	workbook. Then	any	changes	you	make	to	the	data	in	the	original	Excel	workbook	are	reflected	in the	chart. One	final	option	on	the	smart	tag	lets	you	insert	the	chart	as	a	picture.	If	you	choose this	option,	PowerPoint	converts	the	chart	to	a	collection	of	PowerPoint	shape	objects, with	no	linkage	to	the	original	Excel	chart	or	data.   Changing	the	Chart	Type  PowerPoint	enables	you	to	create	14	basic	types	of	charts.	Each	type	conveys information	with	a	different	emphasis.	Sales	data	plotted	in	a	column	chart	might emphasize	the	relative	performance	of	different	regions,	for	example,	and	the	same data	plotted	as	a	line	chart	might	emphasize	an	increase	or	decrease	in	sales	over	time. The	type	of	chart	that’s	best	for	your	data	depends	on	the	nature	of	the	data	and	which aspects	of	it	you	want	to	emphasize. Fortunately,	PowerPoint	doesn’t	force	you	to	decide	the	final	chart	type	up	front.	You can	easily	change	the	chart	type	at	any	time	without	changing	the	chart	data.	These steps	show	you	how:  1.	 Click	the	chart	to	select	it.  When	you	select	a	chart,	a	set	of	three	tabs	called	the	Chart	Tools	is	added	to	the Ribbon.  2.	 Click	the	Design	tab,	as	shown	in	Figure	13-5.  3.	  	Click	the	Change	Chart	Type	button	 shown	in	the	margin   PowerPoint	displays	a	gallery	of	chart	types.  4.	 Click	the	chart	type	that	you	want. 5.	 Click	OK,	and	you’re	done.  Figure	13-5:	The	Chart	Tools	Design	contextual	tab.   Working	with	Chart	Data  The	data	that	provides	the	numbers	plotted	in	a	PowerPoint	chart	is	stored	in	an	Excel workbook.	Depending	on	how	you	created	the	chart,	this	Excel	workbook	can	either	be a	separate	workbook	document	or	be	embedded	within	your	PowerPoint	document. Either	way,	you	can	work	with	Excel	whenever	you	want	to	modify	the	chart	data. To	change	the	data	on	which	a	chart	is	based,	select	the	chart.	A	set	of	three	tabs	called the	Chart	Tools	is	automatically	added	to	the	Ribbon	when	you	select	the	chart.	Next, choose	the	Design	tab.	This	tab	includes	a	group	called	Data,	which	provides	four controls.	These	controls	let	you	perform	various	tricks	on	the	data,	as	described	in	the following	sections. Switching	rows	and	columns  	The	first	control	in	the	Data	group,	shown	in	the	margin,	is	called	Switch  Row Column.	It	changes	the	orientation	of	your	chart	in	a	way	that	can	be	difficult	to describe	but	easy	to	visualize.	Look	back	at	the	chart	in	Figure	13-4.	It’s	based	on	the following	data:  River	City Pixley Hootersville  Instruments 20.4  Music  37.4  Uniforms  90  Instruction 75  50.6  36.6  34.6  102  45.9  45.9  45  88  As	shown	in	Figure	13-4,	the	rows	are	used	to	determine	the	data	categories.	Thus,	the chart	displays	the	data	for	Instruments,	Music,	Uniforms,	and	Instruction	along	the horizontal	axis. If	you	click	the	Switch	Row Column	button,	the	chart	changes,	as	shown	in	Figure	13- 6.	Here,	the	chart	categorizes	the	data	by	city,	so	sales	for	River	City,	Pixley,	and Hootersville	are	shown	along	the	horizontal	axis.   Figure	13-6:	Swapping	the	row column	orientation	of	a	chart.  	If	the	Switch	Row Column	button	is	grayed	out,	it’s	because	the	Excel	data	on which	the	chart	is	based	is	not	open.	Click	the	Edit	Data	button	and	then	return	to PowerPoint	and	the	Switch	Row Column	button	will	come	to	life.  Changing	the	data	selection  	The	Select	Data	button	in	the	Data	group	of	the	Design	tab	 shown	in	the	margin   lets	you	change	the	selection	of	data	that	your	chart	is	based	on.	When	you	click	this button,	you’re	escorted	to	Excel,	and	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	13-7	is	displayed.  Figure	13-7:	The	Select	Data	Source	dialog	box.  This	dialog	box	lets	you	do	three	basic	tasks:   Change	the	range.	You	can	change	the	range	of	data	that’s	used	for	the	chart	by using	the	Chart	Data	Range	text	box. Switch	row column.	You	can	switch	rows	and	columns	by	clicking	the	Switch Row Column	button.	Doing	this	has	the	same	effect	as	clicking	the	Switch Row Column	button	back	in	PowerPoint. Modify	ranges	and	series.	You	can	play	with	the	individual	ranges	that	contain	the data	for	each	series.	You	can	add	a	new	series,	edit	the	range	used	for	an	existing series,	delete	a	series,	or	change	the	order	in	which	the	series	are	presented.  Editing	the	source	data  	To	change	the	actual	data	values	on	which	a	chart	is	based,	click	the	Edit	Data  button	in	the	Data	group	of	the	Design	tab	 shown	in	the	margin .	This	action	launches Excel	to	display	the	chart	data.	You	can	then	make	any	changes	you	want.	When	you return	to	PowerPoint	 by	clicking	anywhere	in	the	PowerPoint	window ,	the	chart	is updated	to	reflect	your	changes. Refreshing	a	chart If	a	chart	is	linked	to	a	separate	Excel	workbook,	you	can	update	the	chart	to	reflect any	changes	that	have	been	made	to	the	underlying	data.	To	do	so,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Click	the	chart	to	select	it.  The	Ribbon	expands	to	include	the	Chart	Tools	tabs.  2.	 Click	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon. 3.	 Click	the	Refresh	Data	button	in	the	Data	group.  The	chart	is	updated	with	the	data	from	the	underlying	Excel	workbook.   Changing	the	Chart	Layout  A	chart	layout	is	a	predefined	combination	of	chart	elements	such	as	legends,	titles, and	so	on.	Microsoft	studied	thousands	of	charts	and	talked	to	chart	experts	to	come	up with	galleries	of	the	most	common	layouts	for	each	chart	type. To	change	the	layout	for	a	chart,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Click	the	chart	to	select	it.  The	Ribbon	expands	to	include	the	Chart	Tools	tabs.  2.	 Click	the	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon. 3.	 Click	the	Quick	Layout	button.  Doing	this	opens	the	Quick	Layout	Gallery,	as	shown	in	Figure	13-8.  4.	 Click	the	layout	you	want	to	use.  The	layout	you	select	is	applied	to	the	chart.	Figure	13-9	shows	the	Band	Sales chart	with	a	different	layout	applied.  Figure	13-8:	The	Quick	Layout	Gallery	for	column	charts.   Figure	13-9:	Changing	the	layout	changes	the	appearance	of	a	chart.   Changing	the	Chart	Style  A	chart	style	is	a	predefined	combination	of	formatting	elements	such	as	colors	and shape	effects.	Microsoft	provides	a	large	assortment	of	chart	styles	to	choose	from.	For example,	Figure	13-10	shows	the	Chart	Style	gallery	for	column	charts.  Figure	13-10:	The	Chart	Style	gallery	for	column	charts.  To	change	the	style	for	a	chart,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Click	the	chart	to	select	it.  The	Ribbon	expands	to	include	the	three	Chart	Tools	tabs.	 Refer	to	Figure	13-5.   2.	 Click	the	Design	tab. 3.	 Select	the	style	you	want	to	use	from	the	Chart	Styles	group.  The	Chart	Styles	group	displays	the	most	commonly	used	styles	for	the	chart	type. If	the	style	you	want	to	use	isn’t	visible	in	this	group,	you	can	click	the	More	button to	display	a	gallery	of	all	available	styles.	 The	More	button	is	the	down-arrow button	at	the	bottom	of	the	scroll	bar	that	appears	at	the	right	side	of	the	Chart Styles	group.    Embellishing	Your	Chart  PowerPoint	enables	you	to	embellish	a	chart	in	many	ways:	You	can	add	titles,	labels, legends,	and	who	knows	what	else.	The	easiest	way	to	add	these	elements	is	by selecting	a	chart	layout,	as	described	in	the	earlier	section	“Changing	the	Chart Layout.”	However,	you	can	create	your	own	unique	chart	layout	by	adding	these elements	individually.  	To	do	that,	select	the	chart	and	then	click	the	Chart	Elements	button	that	appears next	to	the	chart	 shown	in	the	margin .	A	list	of	chart	elements	appears,	as	shown	in Figure	13-11.	You	can	then	select	the	chart	elements	you	want	to	appear	on	your	chart.  Figure	13-11:	Adding	elements	to	a	chart.  The	following	paragraphs	describe	the	elements	you	can	add	to	your	charts:  Axes:	Sometimes	an	axe	is	what	you’d	like	to	use	to	fix	your	computer.	But	in	this case,	axes	refer	to	the	X-	and	Y-axes	on	which	chart	data	is	plotted.	The	X-axis	is the	horizontal	axis	of	the	chart,	and	the	Y-axis	is	the	vertical	axis.	For	3-D	charts,	a third	axis	—	Z	—	is	also	used.	The	Axes	control	lets	you	show	or	hide	the	labels used	for	each	chart	axis. Axis	titles:	These	titles	describe	the	meaning	of	each	chart	axis.	Most	charts	use two	axes	titles:	the	Primary	Horizontal	Axis	Title	and	the	Primary	Vertical	Axis Title. Chart	titles:	A	chart	title	describes	the	chart’s	contents.	It	normally	appears	at	the top	of	the	chart,	but	you	can	drag	it	to	any	location. Data	Labels:	Lets	you	add	labels	to	the	data	points	on	the	chart.	For	maximum control	over	the	data	labels,	choose	More	Options	to	display	the	Format	Data Labels	task	pane,	as	shown	in	Figure	13-12.   	For	most	slide	types,	data	labels	add	unnecessary	clutter	without	adding much	useful	information.	Use	labels	only	if	you	think	that	you	must	back	up	your chart	with	exact	numbers. Data	Table:	The	data	table	is	a	table	that	shows	the	data	used	to	create	a	chart. Most	charts	do	not	include	a	data	table,	but	you	can	add	one	if	you	think	your audience	will	benefit	from	seeing	the	raw	numbers.	For	example,	Figure	13-13 shows	a	chart	with	a	data	table. Error	Bars:	Adds	a	graphical	element	that	indicates	a	range	of	values	for	each point	rather	than	a	single	point.	The	size	of	the	range	can	be	calculated	as	a	fixed value,	a	percentage	of	the	point	value,	or	a	standard	deviation. Gridlines:	Gridlines	are	light	lines	drawn	behind	a	chart	to	make	it	easier	to	judge the	position	of	each	dot,	bar,	or	line	plotted	by	the	chart.	You	can	turn	gridlines	on or	off	via	the	Gridlines	button. Legends:	A	legend	identifies	the	data	series	that	appear	in	the	chart.	When	you click	the	Legend	button,	a	menu	with	several	choices	for	the	placement	of	the legend	appears.	You	can	also	choose	More	Legend	Options	to	display	the	Format Legend	task	pane,	shown	in	Figure	13-14.	From	this	dialog	box,	you	can	set	the position	of	the	legend	as	well	as	control	various	formatting	options	for	the	legend, such	as	the	fill	and	border	style.	 Note	that	you	can	also	drag	the	legend	to	move	it to	another	location	in	the	chart.  PowerPoint	enables	you	to	create	a	legend,	but	you’re	on	your	own	if	you	need	a myth	or	fable. Trendline:	Allows	you	to	add	line	elements,	which	shows	the	trend	of	one	or	more data	points,	using	one	of	several	methods	to	calculate	the	trend.	Figure	13-15	shows a	chart	with	several	trendlines	added.   Figure	13-12:	The	Format	Data	Labels	task	pane.  Figure	13-13:	A	chart	with	a	data	table.   Figure	13-14:	The	Format	Legend	task	pane.  Figure	13-15:	A	chart	with	trendlines.   Chapter	14   Working	with	SmartArt  In	This	Chapter  	Looking	at	the	SmartArt	feature 	Creating	diagrams	using	SmartArt 	Creating	organization	charts  You’ll	hear	nothing	but	yawns	from	the	back	row	if	your	presentation	consists	of	slide after	slide	of	text	and	bulleted	lists	with	an	occasional	bit	of	clip	art	thrown	in	for	good measure.	Mercifully,	PowerPoint	is	well	equipped	to	add	all	sorts	of	embellishments	to your	slides.	This	chapter	shows	you	how	to	work	with	one	of	the	coolest	ways	to embellish	your	slides	—	adding	special	diagrams	called	SmartArt.   Understanding	SmartArt  PowerPoint	includes	a	nifty	little	feature	called	SmartArt,	which	lets	you	add	several different	types	of	useful	diagrams	to	your	slides.	With	SmartArt,	you	can	create	List, Process,	Cycle,	Hierarchy,	Relationship,	Matrix,	Pyramid,	and	Picture	diagrams.	And each	of	these	basic	diagram	types	has	multiple	variations.	In	all,	you	can	choose	from 185	variations. The	diagrams	created	by	SmartArt	consist	of	multiple	elements,	such	as	shapes	and lines.	SmartArt	itself	takes	care	of	drawing	these	elements	in	a	coordinated	fashion,	so you	don’t	have	to	draw	the	separate	elements	manually.  The	basic	idea	behind	SmartArt	diagrams	is	to	represent	bullet	lists	as	a	diagram	of interconnected	shapes.	Although	many	different	types	of	SmartArt	diagrams	are available,	they	all	work	the	same	way.	The	only	real	difference	among	the	various SmartArt	diagram	types	is	how	they	graphically	represent	the	bullets.	For	example, consider	the	following	bullet	list:  Arrive Work Lunch More	work Leave  Figure	14-1	shows	this	list	represented	by	a	SmartArt	diagram.	All	I	did	to	create	this diagram	was	select	the	text,	right-click,	and	choose	Convert	to	SmartArt,	and	then select	the	Descending	Process	SmartArt	diagram	type.   Figure	14-1:	A	simple	SmartArt	diagram.  Note	that	many	of	the	SmartArt	diagram	types	can	display	two	or	more	outline	levels in	your	bullet	list.	For	example,	suppose	you	have	this	list:  Arrive  Work  Lunch  Stop	for	coffee	on	the	way Try	not	to	be	late  Coffee	break	at	10:00 Look	smart!  Best	part	of	the	day! No	more	than	90	minutes  Coffee	break	at	2:00 Try	to	stay	awake	at	4:00  More	work  Leave  Leave	early	today?  Figure	14-2	shows	how	this	list	appears	when	formatted	as	an	Increasing	Arrows Process	chart.	As	you	can	see,	the	second-level	bullets	are	incorporated	as	text	within the	diagram.   Figure	14-2:	How	second-level	text	is	displayed	in	an	Increasing	Arrows	Process	chart.  One	of	the	most	useful	aspects	of	SmartArt	is	that	you	can	easily	change	from	one	type of	diagram	to	another.	Thus,	if	you	decide	that	a	diagram	doesn’t	convey	the	message you	intend,	you	can	try	changing	the	diagram	type	to	see	whether	the	message	is clearer.   Creating	a	SmartArt	Diagram  The	easiest	way	to	create	a	SmartArt	diagram	is	to	create	a	new	slide	and	enter	the bullet	list	as	if	you	were	going	to	display	the	list	as	normal	text	and	then	convert	the text	to	SmartArt.	Just	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Create	a	new	slide	with	the	Title	and	Content	layout. 2.	 Type	your	bullet	list.  Use	one	or	two	levels	of	bullets,	but	try	to	keep	the	list	as	short	and	concise	as	you can.  3.	 Right-click	anywhere	in	the	list	and	choose	Convert	to	SmartArt. A	menu	of	SmartArt	diagram	types	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	14-3.  4.	 Select	the	SmartArt	type	you	want	to	use.  If	the	SmartArt	type	doesn’t	appear	in	the	menu,	you	can	choose	More	SmartArt Graphics	to	display	the	Choose	a	SmartArt	Graphic	dialog	box,	as	shown	in	Figure 14-4.	As	you	can	see,	this	dialog	box	lets	you	choose	from	about	a	million	different SmartArt	diagram	types.	PowerPoint	offers	eight	basic	categories	of	SmartArt diagrams;	these	diagram	types	are	pictured	and	described	in	Table	14-1.  5.	 Click	OK.  The	diagram	is	created.  6.	 Modify	the	diagram	however	you	see	fit.  For	more	information,	see	the	section	“Tweaking	a	SmartArt	Diagram,”	later	in	this chapter.  7.	 You’re	done!  Well,	you’re	never	really	done.	You	can	keep	tweaking	your	diagram	until	the	end of	time	to	get	it	perfect.	But	at	some	point,	you	have	to	say,	“Enough	is	enough,” and	call	it	finished.   Figure	14-3:	Converting	text	to	SmartArt.  Figure	14-4:	The	Choose	a	SmartArt	Graphic	dialog	box.  Table	14-1	Types	of	Diagrams	You	Can	Create  Icon Diagram  Type  Description  List  Shows	a	simple	list.	Some	of	the	list	diagrams	show	information	that	doesn’t	have	any	particular	organization; others	display	information	in	a	way	that	implies	a	sequential	progression,	such	as	steps	in	a	task.  Process  Shows	a	process	in	which	steps	flow	in	a	sequential	fashion.  Cycle  Shows	a	process	that	repeats	in	a	continuous	cycle.  Hierarchy  Shows	hierarchical	relationships,	such	as	organization	charts.  Relationship Shows	how	items	are	conceptually	related	to	one	another.	Included	in	this	group	are	various	types	of	radial	and  Venn	diagrams.  Matrix  Shows	four	items	arranged	into	quadrants.  Pyramid  Shows	how	elements	build	upon	one	another	to	form	a	foundation.   Picture  Shows	information	in	a	variety	of	different	formats	that	incorporate	picture	objects	into	the	chart	design.	For more	information	about	working	with	pictures,	refer	to	Chapter	11.  	If	you	prefer,	you	can	create	a	SmartArt	diagram	by	first	inserting	the	SmartArt diagram	from	the	Insert	Ribbon	tab.	Then	PowerPoint	will	prompt	you	to	enter	the text	for	each	item	in	the	SmartArt	diagram.   Tweaking	a	SmartArt	Diagram  After	you’ve	created	a	SmartArt	diagram,	you	can	adjust	its	appearance	in	many	ways. The	easiest	is	to	change	the	SmartArt	Style	that’s	applied	to	the	diagram.	A	SmartArt Style	is	simply	a	collection	of	formatting	elements	such	as	colors	and	shape	effects	that are	assigned	to	the	various	elements	of	a	SmartArt	diagram. Microsoft	provides	a	large	assortment	of	SmartArt	styles	to	choose	from.	For	example, Figure	14-5	shows	the	style	gallery	for	Pyramid	diagrams.  Figure	14-5:	The	SmartArt	Style	Gallery	for	pyramid	diagrams.  To	change	the	quick	style	for	a	SmartArt	diagram,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Click	the	diagram	to	select	it.  Doing	this	adds	the	SmartArt	tools	to	the	Ribbon.  2.	 Click	the	Design	tab.  Figure	14-6	depicts	the	SmartArt	Tools	Design	tab.  3.	 Select	the	style	you	want	to	use	from	the	SmartArt	Styles	group.  The	Quick	Styles	group	displays	the	most	commonly	used	styles	for	the	diagram type.	If	the	style	you	want	to	use	isn’t	visible	in	this	group,	you	can	click	the	More button	to	display	a	gallery	like	the	one	shown	in	Figure	14-5.  Figure	14-6:	The	SmartArt	Tools	Design	tab.  Note	that	the	SmartArt	Tools	Design	tab	also	includes	controls	that	let	you	modify	the SmartArt	diagram	by	adding	additional	shapes	or	bullet	items	or	changing	the	chart type.	You	can	also	reset	the	diagram	to	its	original	appearance	by	clicking	the	Reset Graphic	button	found	in	the	Reset	group.   Editing	the	SmartArt	Text  When	you	create	a	SmartArt	diagram	from	an	existing	bullet	list,	the	bullet	text	is replaced	by	the	diagram.	After	you’ve	converted	the	text	to	SmartArt,	what	do	you	do if	you	need	to	modify	the	text? To	modify	SmartArt	text,	simply	select	the	SmartArt	diagram.	Then	click	the	little	left- arrow	icon	that	appears	on	the	left	edge	of	the	diagram’s	selection	box.	This	action reveals	a	fly-out	window	called	the	Text	pane,	in	which	you	can	edit	the	bullet	points. See	Figure	14-7.	 On	a	tablet,	you	can	simply	tap	the	text	to	edit	it.   Figure	14-7:	Editing	SmartArt	bullet	text.   Flowcharts,	anyone?  One	type	of	diagram	that	people	often	want	to	create	with	PowerPoint	is	a	flowchart.	Although	SmartArt	doesn’t have	an	option	for	creating	flowcharts,	you	can	easily	create	flowcharts	by	using	PowerPoint’s	AutoShapes.	For example,	take	a	look	at	the	following	flowchart,	which	I	created	with	just	a	few	minutes’	work. To	create	a	flowchart	like	this,	follow	these	basic	steps:  1.	 Draw	each	flowchart	shape	by	using	basic	shape	objects	as	described	in	Chapter	12.  Use	the	shapes	in	the	Flowchart	section	of	the	Shapes	gallery	to	create	the	shapes	for	the	flowchart,	and use	arrows	to	connect	the	shapes.  2.	 Enter	text	into	each	flowchart	shape	by	clicking	the	shape	and	typing.  If	necessary,	adjust	the	text	font	and	size.  3.	 Adjust	the	alignment	of	your	shapes.  Here’s	where	the	flowcharting	AutoShapes	really	shine:	The	connectors	stay	attached	to	the	shapes	even when	you	move	the	shapes	around!	Pretty	slick,	eh?   Working	with	Organization	Charts  Organization	charts	—	you	know,	those	box-and-line	charts	that	show	who	reports	to whom,	where	the	buck	stops,	and	who	got	the	lateral	arabesque	—	are	an	essential	part of	many	presentations. The	hierarchical	SmartArt	diagrams	are	ideal	for	creating	organization	charts.	You	can create	diagrams	that	show	bosses,	subordinates,	co-workers,	and	assistants.	You	can easily	rearrange	the	chain	of	command,	add	new	boxes	or	delete	boxes,	and	apply fancy	3-D	effects.	Figure	14-8	shows	a	finished	organization	chart.  Figure	14-8:	A	finished	organization	chart.  The	bullet	list	I	used	to	create	this	chart	looked	like	this	before	I	converted	it	to SmartArt:  Doc  Sneezy Grumpy  Bashful  Sleepy Happy  Notice	that	Dopey	isn’t	in	this	list.	That’s	because	Dopey	is	in	a	special	kind	of	box	on the	chart,	called	an	Assistant.	You	find	out	how	to	add	Assistant	boxes	later	in	this chapter.  	Keep	in	mind	that	organization	charts	are	useful	for	more	than	showing  employee	relationships.	You	also	can	use	them	to	show	any	kind	of	hierarchical   structure.	For	example,	back	when	I	wrote	computer	programs	for	a	living,	I	used organization	charts	to	plan	the	structure	of	my	computer	programs.	They’re	also great	for	recording	family	genealogies,	although	they	don’t	have	any	way	to indicate	that	Aunt	Millie	hasn’t	spoken	to	Aunt	Beatrice	in	30	years.  Adding	boxes	to	a	chart You	can	add	a	box	to	an	organization	chart	by	calling	up	the	Text	pane	and	editing	the text.	Refer	to	the	section	“Editing	the	SmartArt	Text,”	earlier	in	this	chapter,	for	tips	on how	to	do	that. Alternatively,	you	can	use	the	controls	in	the	SmartArt	Tools	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to	add boxes.	One	nice	feature	that	these	controls	provide	is	the	capability	to	add	an	Assistant, which	is	a	box	that	appears	outside	of	the	hierarchical	chain	of	command.	Here	are	the steps:  1.	 Click	the	box	you	want	the	new	box	to	be	below	or	next	to. 2.	 Open	the	SmartArt	Tools	tab	on	the	Ribbon. 3.	 Click	the	Add	Shape	button	to	reveal	a	menu	of	choices.	Then	select	one	of	the  following	options:  Add	Shape	Before:	Inserts	a	new	box	at	the	same	level	as	the	selected	box, immediately	to	its	left. Add	Shape	After:	Inserts	a	new	box	at	the	same	level	as	the	selected	box, immediately	to	its	right. Add	Shape	Above:	Inserts	a	new	box	above	the	selected	box. Add	Shape	Below:	Inserts	a	new	box	beneath	the	selected	box. Add	Assistant:	Inserts	a	new	box	beneath	the	selected	box,	but	the	new	box is	connected	with	a	special	elbow	connector	to	indicate	that	the	box	is	an Assistant,	not	a	subordinate.  4.	 Click	the	new	box	and	then	type	whatever	text	you	want	to	appear	in	the	box. 5.	 If	necessary,	drag	the	box	to	adjust	its	location. Deleting	chart	boxes To	delete	a	box	from	an	organization	chart,	select	the	box	and	press	Delete.	PowerPoint automatically	adjusts	the	chart	to	compensate	for	the	lost	box. When	you	delete	a	box	from	an	organization	chart,	you	should	observe	a	moment	of somber	silence	—	or	throw	a	party.	It	all	depends	on	whose	name	was	in	the	box,	I suppose. Changing	the	chart	layout PowerPoint	lets	you	choose	from	four	methods	of	arranging	subordinates	in	an   organization	chart	branch:  Standard:	Subordinate	shapes	are	placed	at	the	same	level	beneath	the	superior shape. Both	Hanging:	Subordinates	are	placed	two	per	level	beneath	the	superior	with	the connecting	line	between	them. Left	Hanging:	Subordinates	are	stacked	vertically	beneath	the	superior,	to	the	left of	the	connecting	line. Right	Hanging:	Subordinates	are	stacked	vertically	beneath	the	superior,	to	the right	of	the	connecting	line.  Figure	14-9	shows	an	organization	chart	that	uses	all	four	of	these	layouts.	Sneezy, Grumpy,	and	Bashful	use	Standard	layout.	Sleepy	and	Happy	use	Both	Hanging	layout. Groucho,	Harpo,	and	Chico	use	Left	Hanging	layout,	and	Manny,	Moe,	and	Jack	use Right	Hanging	layout.  Figure	14-9:	An	organization	chart	that	uses	all	four	layout	types.  To	change	the	layout	of	a	branch	of	your	chart,	first	click	the	shape	at	the	top	of	the branch,	and	then	click	the	SmartArt	Tools	Design	tab	on	the	Ribbon.	Then	click	the Layout	button	in	the	Create	Graphic	group	and	choose	the	layout	type	you	want	to	use.   Chapter	15   Lights!	Camera!	Action!	 Adding	Sound  and	Video   In	This	Chapter  	Adding	interesting	sound	effects	to	your	presentation 	Spicing	your	presentation	up	with	video 	Fiddling	with	audio	and	video	settings  One	of	the	cool	things	about	PowerPoint	is	that	it	lets	you	create	slides	that	contain	not only	text	and	pictures	but	also	sounds	and	even	movies.	You	can	add	sound	effects, such	as	screeching	brakes	or	breaking	glass,	to	liven	up	dull	presentations.	You	can even	add	your	own	applause,	making	your	presentation	like	a	TV	sitcom	or	game	show. You	can	also	add	a	musical	background	or	a	narration	to	your	presentation. Additionally,	you	can	insert	a	film	clip	from	The	African	Queen	or	a	picture	of	the space	shuttle	launching	if	you	think	that	will	help	keep	people	awake.	This	chapter shows	you	how	to	add	those	special	effects. This	chapter	is	short	because	you	can’t	do	as	much	with	sound	and	video	in PowerPoint	as	you	can	with,	say,	a	professional	multimedia-authoring	program,	such	as Adobe	Director	or	a	video	editor	such	as	Adobe	Premiere.	Still,	PowerPoint	allows	you to	paste	sound	and	video	elements	into	your	slide	show,	thus	giving	you	the	power	to craft	some	impressive	high-tech	presentations.	And	PowerPoint	2016	allows	you	to perform	basic	edits	on	the	videos	you	insert.   Getting	Ready	to	Add	Sound	to	a	Slide  A	sterile	beep	used	to	be	the	only	sound	you	could	get	from	your	computer.	Nowadays, you	can	make	your	computer	talk	almost	as	well	as	the	computers	in	the	Star	Trek movies,	or	you	can	give	your	computer	a	sophomoric	sense	of	audible	distaste.	At	last, the	computer	can	be	as	obnoxious	as	the	user! Investigating	sound	files Computer	sounds	are	stored	in	sound	files,	which	come	in	two	basic	varieties:  Audio	files:	Audio	files	contain	digitized	recordings	of	real	sounds.	These	sounds can	be	sound	effects,	such	as	cars	screeching,	guns	firing,	or	drums	rolling;	music; or	even	quotes	from	movies	or	your	favorite	TV	shows.	 Imagine	Darth	Vader saying	to	your	audience,	“I	find	your	lack	of	faith	disturbing.”  Audio	files	come	in	two	distinct	varieties:  Uncompressed:	This	type	of	audio	file	 including	the	standard	Windows WAV	format 	provides	pristine,	clean	sound	 and	packs	a	large	file	size	to prove	it .	Both	Windows	and	PowerPoint	come	with	a	collection	of	WAV files	that	provide	simple	sound	effects	such	as	swooshes,	blips,	applause, and	drum	rolls. Compressed:	For	longer	sound	clips,	such	as	complete	songs,	the	most common	formats	are	MP3	and	MP4.  MIDI	files:	MIDI	files	contain	music	stored	in	a	form	that	your	computer’s	music synthesizer	can	play.	Think	of	it	like	sheet	music	for	your	digital	piano	player. Windows	comes	with	several	MIDI	files,	and	you	can	download	many	more	from the	Internet.	MIDI	files	have	the	file	extension	.mid.  To	insert	a	sound	into	a	PowerPoint	presentation,	all	you	have	to	do	is	paste	one	of these	sound	files	into	a	slide.	Then	when	you	run	the	presentation	in	Slide	Show	View, you	can	have	the	sounds	play	automatically	during	slide	transitions,	or	you	can	play them	manually	by	clicking	the	Sound	button. Fortunately,	the	national	shortage	of	sound	files	ended	years	ago.	PowerPoint	comes with	a	handful	of	useful	sound	files,	including	drum	rolls,	breaking	glass,	gunshots,	and typewriter	sounds.	Windows	comes	with	some	useful	sounds,	too.	But	a	virtually unlimited	supply	of	sounds	is	available	at	your	disposal	via	the	Internet.	Pop	into	any of	the	popular	search	engines	 such	as	www.google.com 	and	perform	a	general	search, such	as	“WAV	file	collection,”	or	a	specific	search,	such	as	“Star	Trek	sounds.”   MP3	and	the	Internet  MP3	files	are	a	compressed	form	of	wave	files	that	allow	entire	songs	to	be	squeezed	into	a	reasonable	amount	of hard	drive	space.	For	example,	the	Steppenwolf	song,	“Wild	Thing,”	weighs	in	at	just	under	2.5MB	in	an	MP3	file. The	same	file	in	WAV	format	requires	a	whopping	26MB	—	more	than	ten	times	the	space. Napster,	the	online	file	exchange	system	that	let	users	swap	MP3	files,	popularized	the	MP3	format.	Of	course,	this file	swapping	bothered	the	music	industry,	which	sued	because	it	said	users	were	illegally	trading	copyrighted	music without	paying	for	it,	which	of	course	they	were,	and	we	 oops,	I	mean	they 	all	knew	it. These	days,	the	most	popular	sources	for	legally	obtaining	MP3	files	are	iTunes,	Amazon.com,	and	Google	Play. You	can	legally	download	music	from	these	sources,	and	you	can	still	find	plenty	of	online	sources	to	trade	music under	the	table.	Another	popular	way	to	obtain	MP3	files	is	to	rip	them	from	a	music	CD.	Windows	Media	player has	the	built-in	capability	to	do	this.	 Note	that	you	can’t	use	music	streamed	from	services	such	as	Amazon	Prime or	Spotify	in	your	presentations.  Keep	in	mind,	however,	that	the	legality	of	using	copyrighted	music	in	your	PowerPoint	presentations	is questionable.	So	if	you	use	hot	MP3	files	you	got	from	the	Internet	or	ripped	from	a	CD,	don’t	blame	me	if	one	day you	wake	up	and	find	your	house	surrounded	by	federal	agents	and	CNN	news	crews,	who	refer	to	you	as	a “dangerous	copyright	abuser”	and	your	house	as	a	“compound.”	They’ll	probably	even	interview	your	ninth-grade English	teacher,	who	will	tell	the	nation	that	all	you	could	talk	about	when	you	were	a	troubled	teen	was	stealing Aerosmith	music	from	the	Internet	and	using	it	in	illegal	PowerPoint	presentations.  Inserting	an	audio	sound	object In	this	section,	I	explain	how	to	insert	a	sound	object	onto	a	slide.	You	can	configure the	sound	object	to	play	automatically	whenever	you	display	the	slide,	or	you	can	set	it up	so	that	it	will	play	only	when	you	click	the	sound	object’s	icon.	Note	that	if	you want	the	sound	to	play	automatically	and	the	sound	is	a	WAV	file,	it’s	easier	to	add	it	to the	slide	transition	 as	described	in	Chapter	9 	than	to	add	it	as	a	separate	object. To	insert	a	sound	file	from	your	hard	drive	onto	a	PowerPoint	slide,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	to	which	you	want	to	add	the	sound. 2.	 Open	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Audio	button	located	on	the	right  side	of	the	tab,	and	then	choose	Audio	on	My	PC. The	Insert	Audio	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	15-1.  3.	 Select	the	audio	file	that	you	want	to	insert.  You	may	have	to	rummage	about	your	hard	drive	to	find	the	folder	that	contains your	sound	files.	 In	Figure	15-1,	I	navigated	over	to	my	Downloads	folder	to	find some	MP3	files	that	I	recently	downloaded.   4.	 Click	the	Insert	button.  The	audio	file	is	inserted	into	the	current	slide,	along	with	a	toolbar	of	controls	that let	you	play	the	sound.	See	Figure	15-2.   Figure	15-1:	The	Insert	Audio	dialog	box.  Figure	15-2:	A	sound	inserted	onto	a	slide.  	You	can	also	insert	sounds	from	the	Internet.	To	do	so,	click	the	Audio	button on	the	Insert	task	pane	tab	and	then	choose	Online	Audio.	Then,	you	can	search for	the	sound	you	want	to	insert.  Here	are	a	few	other	random	thoughts	on	adding	sounds	to	your	slides:  To	play	a	sound	while	working	in	Normal	View,	double-click	the	sound	icon. However,	to	play	the	sound	during	a	slide	show,	click	only	once.  	Remember	that	you	can	also	play	audio	files	as	a	part	of	the	slide	transition.  For	more	information,	see	Chapter	9.   If	you	change	your	mind	and	decide	that	you	don’t	want	any	sounds,	you	can	easily remove	them.	To	remove	a	sound,	click	the	sound’s	icon	 which	resembles	a speaker 	and	press	Delete.   Setting	Audio	Options  You	can	control	several	important	aspects	of	how	an	audio	file	is	played	by	selecting the	file	to	reveal	the	Audio	Tools	contextual	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	opening	the Playback	tab,	shown	in	Figure	15-3.	As	you	can	see,	this	tab	contains	several	controls that	let	you	edit	the	way	the	sound	file	is	played.	The	following	sections	explain	how	to use	the	most	important	of	these	tools.  Figure	15-3:	The	Audio	Tools	Playback	tab.  Controlling	when	a	sound	is	played By	default,	sounds	are	not	played	until	you	click	the	sound	icon	that	appears	on	the slide.	If	you	want	a	sound	to	play	automatically	when	the	slide	is	displayed,	change	the option	in	the	Start	drop-down	list	 found	in	the	Audio	Options	group	on	the	Audio Tools	Playback	tab 	from	On	Click	to	Automatically. If	you	select	On	Click	or	Automatically,	the	sound	automatically	stops	when	you	move to	the	next	slide.	To	allow	the	sound	to	continue	over	several	slides,	select	the	Play Across	Slides	option	from	the	Start	drop-down	list. Looping	a	sound If	the	sound	file	isn’t	long	enough,	you	can	loop	it	so	that	it	plays	over	and	over	again. This	feature	is	most	useful	when	you	have	a	subtle	sound	effect,	such	as	the	sound	of waves	crashing,	that	you	want	to	continue	for	as	long	as	you	leave	the	slide	visible.	To loop	an	audio	clip,	just	select	the	Loop	Until	Stopped	check	box	found	in	the	Audio Options	group. Hiding	the	sound	icon By	default,	the	icon	representing	an	audio	clip	is	visible	on	the	slide	during	your	slide show.	Assuming	that	you	have	set	the	sound	to	play	automatically,	you	probably	don’t want	the	icon	visible. The	Audio	Options	group	includes	a	check	box	titled	Hide	While	Not	Playing,	but	it hides	the	icon	only	when	the	sound	is	not	playing;	the	icon	is	visible	when	the	sound	is playing.  	The	easiest	way	to	get	the	icon	off	of	your	slides	altogether	is	to	simply	drag the	icon	off	the	edge	of	the	slide	that	contains	it.	The	sound	will	still	be	a	part	of   the	slide,	so	it	will	play	automatically	when	the	slide	is	displayed.	But	because	the icon	is	off	the	edge	of	the	slide,	it	won’t	be	visible	to	your	audience.  Fading	the	sound	in	and	out The	Fade	In	and	Fade	Out	controls	let	you	gradually	fade	your	audio	clip	in	and	out. By	default,	these	controls	are	both	set	to	0,	so	the	audio	clip	begins	and	ends	at	full volume.	By	changing	either	or	both	of	these	controls	to	a	value	such	as	2	or	3	seconds, you	can	smoothly	fade	the	sound	in	or	out	for	a	more	subtle	effect. Trimming	an	audio	clip Clicking	the	Trim	Audio	button	brings	up	the	Trim	Audio	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure 15-4.	This	dialog	box	enables	you	to	select	just	a	portion	of	the	audio	clip	to	play	in your	presentation	by	letting	you	choose	start	and	end	times.	You	can	choose	the	start and	end	times	by	dragging	the	green	start	pointer	or	the	red	end	pointer	over	the	image of	the	audio	file’s	waveform.	 You	can	often	tell	where	to	stop	or	end	the	audio	clip	by looking	at	the	waveform	that’s	displayed	in	the	Trim	Audio	dialog	box. 	You	can	also enter	the	time	 in	seconds 	in	the	Start	Time	and	End	Time	boxes.  Figure	15-4:	The	Trim	Audio	dialog	box.   Adding	Video	to	Your	Slides  Video	doesn’t	just	belong	on	YouTube.	You	can	easily	add	video	clips	to	your presentations	and	play	them	at	will.	I’m	not	sure	why	you	would	want	to,	but	hey,	who needs	a	reason? Adding	a	movie	motion	clip	to	a	slide	is	similar	to	adding	a	sound	clip.	A	crucial difference	exists,	however,	between	motion	clips	and	sound	bites:	Video	is	meant	to	be seen	 and	sometimes	heard .	An	inserted	motion	clip	should	be	given	ample	space	on your	slide.  	If	you	think	that	sound	files	are	big,	wait	till	you	see	how	big	movie	clips	are. Ha!	They	consume	hard	drive	space	the	way	an	elephant	consumes	veggies.	The whole	multimedia	revolution	is	really	a	conspiracy	started	by	hard	drive manufacturers.	 Be	aware	that	you	may	have	trouble	sending	a	PowerPoint presentation	bloated	with	large	video	files	to	your	friends	and	colleagues	via	email because	many	email	servers	have	limits	on	the	size	of	email	attachments.   The	following	steps	show	you	how	to	add	a	video	clip	to	a	slide:  1.	 Find	a	good	movie	and,	if	needed,	download	it	or	upload	it	to	your	hard	drive. The	hardest	part	about	using	video	in	a	PowerPoint	presentation	is	finding	a	video file	that’s	worth	showing.	Use	Google	or	any	other	search	service	to	find	a	video	to insert.	Then,	download	the	video	to	your	computer.	Or,	you	can	create	your	own videos	using	a	camcorder	and	video-editing	software.  2.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	insert	the	movie.  Hopefully,	you	left	a	big	blank	space	on	the	slide	to	put	the	movie	in.	If	not, rearrange	the	existing	slide	objects	to	make	room	for	the	movie.  3.	 Open	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	Video	in	the	Media	group,	and	then  choose	Video	on	My	PC. The	Insert	Video	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	15-5,	appears.  4.	 Select	the	movie	that	you	want	to	insert.  You	may	need	to	scroll	the	list	to	find	the	movie	you’re	looking	for	or	navigate your	way	to	a	different	folder.  5.	 Click	the	Insert	button.  The	movie	is	inserted	on	the	slide,	as	shown	in	Figure	15-6.  6.	 Resize	the	movie	if	you	want	and	drag	it	to	a	new	location	on	the	slide.  When	you	resize	the	movie,	try	to	do	it	by	using	one	of	the	corner	handles.	If	you drag	one	of	the	side	handles,	you	distort	the	image.   To	play	the	movie	while	you’re	working	on	the	presentation	in	Normal	View, double-click	the	movie.	During	a	slide	show,	a	single	click	does	the	trick,	unless you	set	the	movie	to	play	automatically.	In	that	case,	the	movie	runs	as	soon	as	you display	the	slide.  Figure	15-5:	Inserting	a	video.  Figure	15-6:	A	movie	inserted	on	a	slide.  	You	can	also	insert	a	video	directly	from	an	online	source	by	choosing	Online  Video	rather	than	Video	on	My	PC	in	Step	3.	Then,	you	can	search	for	a	video online.	Note	that	this	option	inserts	a	link	to	the	online	video,	not	the	video	itself. That	means	that	you	must	have	a	working	network	connection	to	play	the	video, and	if	the	owner	of	the	video	removes	the	video,	the	link	won’t	work.   Setting	Video	Options  You	can	set	various	options	for	playing	video	files	via	the	Video	Tools	Playback	tab	on the	Ribbon,	shown	in	Figure	15-7.	As	you	can	see,	this	tab	contains	several	controls that	let	you	edit	the	way	the	sound	file	is	played.	The	following	sections	explain	how	to use	the	most	important	of	these	tools.  Figure	15-7:	The	Video	Tools	Playback	tab.  Controlling	when	a	video	is	played By	default,	videos	play	when	you	click	the	Play	button	that	appears	beneath	the	video frame.	If	you	want	the	video	to	start	automatically	when	you	display	the	slide,	change the	option	in	the	Start	drop-down	list	 found	in	the	Video	Options	group	on	the	Video Tools	Edit	tab 	from	On	Click	to	Automatically. Looping	a	video If	the	video	is	short,	you	may	want	to	repeat	it	over	and	over	again	until	you	move	to the	next	slide.	To	do	so,	select	the	Loop	Until	Stopped	check	box	found	in	the	Video Options	group. Trimming	a	video	clip The	Trim	Video	button	summons	the	Trim	Video	dialog	box,	which	is	shown	in	Figure 15-8.	Here,	you	can	select	the	portion	of	the	video	clip	you	want	to	play	in	your presentation.	You	can	choose	the	start	and	end	points	of	the	video	by	dragging	the	start pointer	or	the	red	end	pointer	over	the	image	of	the	video’s	soundtrack	wave,	which appears	immediately	beneath	the	video	frame.	Or,	you	can	enter	the	time	 in	seconds  in	the	Start	Time	and	End	Time	boxes.   Figure	15-8:	The	Trim	Video	dialog	box.  Playing	the	video	full	screen If	you	want	the	video	to	take	over	the	entire	screen,	select	the	Play	Full	Screen	check box.	Note	that	this	option	works	best	for	high-quality	videos.	If	the	video	is	of	lower quality,	it	may	not	look	good	when	played	in	full-screen	mode. Fading	the	video’s	sound	in	and	out The	Fade	In	and	Fade	Out	controls	for	video	clips	work	just	as	they	do	for	audio	clips  described	earlier	in	this	chapter .	In	other	words,	they	affect	the	video’s	sound	track, not	the	video	image	itself.	You	can	use	these	controls	to	gradually	fade	the	video’s sound	in	and	out. Adding	a	bookmark A	bookmark	is	a	marked	location	within	the	playback	of	a	video	file	that	can	be	used	to trigger	an	animation	effect.	For	example,	a	few	seconds	into	the	video	of	the	Apollo	11 launch	shown	in	the	previous	two	figures,	the	announcer	says	“Liftoff!”	and	the	rocket begins	to	rise.	It’s	a	simple	matter	to	create	a	bookmark	at	that	exact	point	in	the	video playback.	Then,	you	can	use	that	bookmark	to	trigger	an	animation	that	causes	the word	“Liftoff!”	to	appear	beneath	the	video,	as	shown	in	Figure	15-9.   Figure	15-9:	Using	a	bookmark	to	trigger	an	animation	effect.  Here	are	the	steps	for	creating	a	video	bookmark	and	animating	an	object	when	the video	playback	reaches	the	bookmark:  1.	 Add	a	video	to	the	slide.  For	this	example,	I	added	a	video	of	the	Apollo	11	launch	that	I	downloaded	from the	Internet.  2.	 Select	the	video	object	and	then	select	the	Video	Tools	Playback	tab.  This	tab	was	shown	earlier	in	Figure	15-7.  3.	 Click	the	Play	button	that	appears	beneath	the	video	frame.  The	video	begins	to	play.  4.	  	When	the	video	reaches	the	point	where	you	want	to	insert	the  bookmark,	click	the	Add	Bookmark	button	on	the	Playback	tab	 shown	in	the margin . The	bookmark	is	created;	a	small	dot	appears	in	the	progress	bar	that	appears beneath	the	video	frame	to	mark	the	location	of	the	bookmark.  5.	 Create	an	object	on	the	slide	that	you	will	animate	when	the	bookmark	is  reached	during	playback.   For	this	example,	I	created	a	text	box	with	the	text	“Liftoff!”  6.	 Click	the	Animations	tab. 7.	 Select	the	object	you	created	in	Step	5	and	then	click	the	Add	Animation  button	in	the	Animations	tab.	Select	the	animation	effect	you	want. For	this	example,	I	chose	the	Appear	effect	to	cause	the	object	to	appear.  8.	 Click	the	Trigger	button	on	the	Animations	tab,	choose	On	Bookmark,	and  then	choose	the	bookmark	you	created	in	Step	4. Doing	this	sets	up	the	animation	so	that	it	is	triggered	automatically	when	the bookmark	in	the	video	is	reached. You’re	done!  Here	are	a	few	additional	points	to	ponder	concerning	bookmarks:  You	can	create	more	than	one	bookmark	in	a	single	video.	Each	bookmark	can	be used	as	an	animation	trigger.  	To	remove	a	bookmark,	click	the	small	circle	that	represents	the	bookmark  in	the	video’s	slider	bar.	Then	click	the	Remove	Bookmark	button	in	the	Ribbon  shown	in	the	margin . For	more	information	about	creating	animations,	refer	to	Chapter	9.   Chapter	16   More	Things	to	Insert	on	Your	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Adding	a	table	to	a	slide 	Using	the	Insert	tab	to	create	a	WordArt	object 	Adding	a	hyperlink	to	a	slide 	Working	with	action	buttons 	Creating	fancy	equations  The	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	is	chock-full	of	goodies	you	can	insert	into	your presentations.	The	most	important	of	these	goodies	have	already	been	covered	in	other chapters:	pictures	clip	art	 Chapter	11 ,	shapes	 Chapter	12 ,	SmartArt	 Chapter	14 , and	movies	and	sounds	 Chapter	15 . But	you	can	insert	a	lot	more,	including	tables,	WordArt,	hyperlinks,	and	actions.	This chapter	covers	these	items.   Inserting	Tables  Tables	are	a	great	way	to	present	lots	of	information	in	an	orderly	fashion.	For example,	if	you	want	to	create	a	slide	that	shows	how	many	people	like	or	hate	various computer	presentation	programs,	a	table	is	the	way	to	go.	Or	if	you’re	considering purchasing	some	new	computer	equipment	and	want	to	list	the	prices	for	five	different computer	configurations	from	three	different	vendors,	a	table	is	the	best	way.  Creating	a	table	in	a	Content	placeholder Basic	tables	are	simple	to	create	in	PowerPoint.	The	easiest	way	to	create	a	slide	that contains	a	table	is	to	use	the	Title	and	Content	slide	layout.	Just	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Open	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	New	Slide	button	in	the  Slides	group	to	add	a	slide	with	the	Title	and	Content	layout. A	new	slide	is	created.  2.	 Click	the	Table	icon	in	the	center	of	the	Content	placeholder.  The	Insert	Table	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-1.  3.	 Set	the	number	of	rows	and	columns	you	want	for	the	table	and	then	click	OK.  The	table	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-2.  4.	 Type	information	into	the	table’s	cells.  You	can	click	any	cell	in	the	table	and	start	typing.	Or	you	can	move	from	cell	to cell	by	pressing	the	Tab	key	or	the	arrow	keys.  5.	 Play	with	the	formatting	if	you	want.  You	can	use	Table	Tools	on	the	Ribbon,	described	later	in	this	section,	to	control   the	formatting	for	the	table. 6.	 Stop	and	smell	the	roses.  When	you’re	done,	you’re	done.	Admire	your	work.  Figure	16-1:	The	Insert	Table	dialog	box.  Figure	16-2:	An	empty	table,	waiting	for	data.  Figure	16-3	shows	an	example	of	a	finished	table.  Figure	16-3:	A	finished	table.   Inserting	a	table	on	a	slide You	can	use	the	Table	button	on	the	Insert	tab	to	insert	a	table	on	an	existing	slide. When	you	click	this	button,	a	gridlike	menu	appears	that	enables	you	to	select	the	size of	the	table	you	want	to	create,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-4.	You	can	use	this	technique	to create	a	table	as	large	as	ten	columns	and	eight	rows.  Figure	16-4:	Inserting	a	table.  Drawing	a	table A	third	way	to	create	a	table	is	to	use	the	Draw	Table	command.	The	Draw	Table command	lets	you	draw	complicated	tables	onscreen	by	using	a	simple	set	of	drawing tools.	This	command	is	ideal	for	creating	tables	that	are	not	a	simple	grid	of	rows	and columns,	but	rather	a	complex	conglomeration	in	which	some	cells	span	more	than	one row	and	others	span	more	than	one	column. Here’s	the	procedure	for	creating	a	table	by	using	the	Draw	Table	tool:  1.	 On	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Table	button	in	the	Tables	group  and	then	choose	Draw	Table	from	the	menu	that	appears. PowerPoint	changes	the	cursor	to	a	little	pencil.  2.	 Draw	the	overall	shape	of	the	table	by	dragging	the	mouse	to	create	a  rectangular	boundary	for	the	table. When	you	release	the	mouse	button,	a	table	with	a	single	cell	is	created,	as	shown in	Figure	16-5.	Notice	also	in	this	figure	that	Table	Tools	is	displayed	on	the Ribbon.  3.	  	Click	the	Draw	Table	button	in	the	Table	Tools	Design	tab	 shown	in	the   margin . The	mouse	pointer	changes	into	a	little	pencil	when	you	click	this	button.  4.	 Carve	the	table	into	smaller	cells.  To	do	that,	just	drag	lines	across	the	table.	For	example,	to	split	the	table	into	two rows,	point	the	cursor	somewhere	along	the	left	edge	of	the	table	and	then	click	and drag	a	line	across	the	table	to	the	right	edge.	When	you	release	the	mouse	button, the	table	splits	into	two	rows. You	can	continue	to	carve	the	table	into	smaller	and	smaller	cells.	For	each	slice, point	the	cursor	at	one	edge	of	where	you	want	the	new	cell	to	begin	and	click	and drag	to	the	other	edge.  5.	 If	you	want	to	change	the	line	size	or	style	drawn	for	a	particular	segment,	use the	Pen	Style	and	Pen	Weight	drop-down	controls	in	the	Draw	Borders	group on	the	Table	Tools	Design	tab. You	can	change	the	style	of	a	line	you’ve	already	drawn	by	tracing	over	the	line with	a	new	style.  6.	 If	you	make	a	mistake	while	drawing	the	table	cells,	click	the	Eraser	 the	one  that	looks	like	an	eraser 	button	in	the	Draw	Borders	group	and	erase	the mistaken	line	segment. Or,	just	press	Ctrl+Z	or	click	the	Undo	button	on	the	Quick	Access	Toolbar. If	you	want	to	draw	additional	segments	after	using	the	Erase	tool,	click	the	Draw Table	button.  	The	most	common	mistake	I	make	when	drawing	table	cells	is	to  accidentally	create	diagonal	borders.	If	you	make	this	common	mistake,	just	press Ctrl+Z	or	click	the	Undo	button,	or	use	the	eraser	to	erase	the	diagonal	border.  7.	 When	you’re	done,	click	outside	of	the	table	to	finish	drawing	the	table.   Figure	16-5:	Drawing	a	table.  Figure	16-6	shows	a	table	carved	up	into	several	cells,	with	various	types	of	line	styles and	line	weights.  Figure	16-6:	A	finished	table.  Applying	style	to	a	table After	you’ve	created	a	table,	you	can	set	its	style	by	using	the	controls	under	Table Tools	on	the	Ribbon.	The	easiest	way	to	format	a	table	is	by	applying	one	of PowerPoint’s	predefined	table	styles. Before	you	apply	a	style,	however,	use	the	check	boxes	that	appear	at	the	left	side	of the	Design	tab	under	Table	Tools	on	the	Ribbon.	These	check	boxes	determine	whether PowerPoint	uses	special	formatting	for	certain	parts	of	the	table:  Header	Row:	Indicates	whether	the	style	should	format	the	first	row	differently   than	the	other	rows	in	the	table Total	Row:	Indicates	whether	the	style	should	format	the	last	row	differently	than the	other	rows	in	the	table Banded	Rows:	Indicates	whether	alternating	rows	should	be	formatted	differently First	Column:	Indicates	whether	the	style	should	format	the	first	column differently	than	the	other	columns	in	the	table Last	Column:	Indicates	whether	the	style	should	format	the	last	column	differently than	the	other	columns	in	the	table Banded	Columns:	Indicates	whether	alternating	columns	should	be	formatted differently  After	you’ve	set	the	Quick	Style	options,	you	can	apply	a	Table	Style	to	the	table	by clicking	the	style	you	want	to	apply	 refer	to	Figure	16-5 .	If	the	style	doesn’t	appear	in the	Table	Styles	group	under	Table	Tools	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	More	button	to reveal	the	Table	Styles	gallery,	shown	in	Figure	16-7.	This	gallery	displays	all	the	built- in	styles	provided	with	PowerPoint.   Figure	16-7:	The	Table	Styles	gallery.  In	addition	to	using	one	of	the	preselected	table	styles,	you	can	format	each	cell	and line	in	your	table	by	using	the	following	controls	under	Table	Tools:  	Shading:	Sets	the	background	color	for	the	selected	cells. 	Borders:	Lets	you	control	which	edges	of	the	selected	cells	have  borders.  	Effects:	Applies	bevels,	shadows,	and	reflections.	 Note	that	you	can apply	bevels	to	individual	cells,	but	shadows	and	reflections	apply	to	the	entire table.    Working	with	the	Layout	tab When	you	select	a	table,	a	special	Layout	tab	is	available,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-8.	The controls	on	this	tab	let	you	adjust	the	layout	of	your	table	in	various	ways.	Table	16-1 lists	the	function	of	each	of	these	controls.  Figure	16-8:	The	Layout	tab	under	Table	Tools.

WordArt	also	appears	on	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	which provides	a	convenient	way	to	insert	a	text	box	with	text	that	is	already	formatted	with WordArt	formatting. To	insert	WordArt,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	insert	WordArt. 2.	 Click	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	WordArt	button	in	the  Text	group. A	gallery	of	WordArt	styles	is	displayed,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-9.  3.	 Select	the	WordArt	style	you	want	to	use.  The	WordArt	text	box	is	inserted	on	the	slide,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-10. 4.	 Click	the	WordArt	text	box	and	then	type	the	text	you	want	to	use. 5.	 Apply	any	other	WordArt	formatting	you	want.  For	more	information	about	WordArt	formatting,	refer	to	Chapter	7.  Figure	16-9:	The	WordArt	gallery.   Figure	16-10:	A	WordArt	text	box.   Using	Hyperlinks  In	PowerPoint,	a	hyperlink	is	simply	a	bit	of	text	or	a	graphic	image	that	you	can	click when	viewing	a	slide	to	summon	another	slide,	another	presentation,	or	perhaps	some other	type	of	document,	such	as	a	Word	document	or	an	Excel	spreadsheet.	The hyperlink	may	also	lead	to	a	page	on	the	World	Wide	Web. For	example,	suppose	that	you	have	a	slide	that	contains	a	chart	of	sales	trends.	You can	place	a	hyperlink	on	the	slide	that,	if	clicked	during	a	slide	show,	summons	another slide	presenting	the	same	data	in	the	form	of	a	table.	That	slide	can	in	turn	contain	a hyperlink	that,	when	clicked,	summons	an	Excel	spreadsheet	that	contains	the	detailed data	on	which	the	chart	is	based. Another	common	use	for	hyperlinks	is	to	create	a	table	of	contents	for	your presentation.	You	can	create	a	slide	—	usually	the	first	or	second	slide	in	the presentation	—	that	contains	links	to	other	slides	in	the	presentation.	The	table	of contents	slide	may	include	a	link	to	every	slide	in	the	presentation,	but	more	likely,	it contains	links	to	selected	slides.	For	example,	if	a	presentation	contains	several sections	of	slides,	the	table	of	contents	slide	may	contain	links	to	the	first	slide	in	each section. Hyperlinks	are	not	limited	to	slides	in	the	current	presentation.	Hyperlinks	can	lead	to other	presentations.	When	you	use	this	kind	of	hyperlink,	a	person	viewing	the	slide show	clicks	the	hyperlink,	and	PowerPoint	automatically	loads	the	indicated presentation.	The	hyperlink	can	lead	to	the	first	slide	in	the	presentation,	or	it	can	lead to	a	specific	slide	within	the	presentation. A	common	use	for	this	type	of	hyperlink	is	to	create	a	menu	of	presentations	that	can be	viewed.	For	example,	suppose	that	you	have	created	the	following	four presentations:  The	Detrimental	Effects	of	Pool Case	Studies	in	Communities	Destroyed	by	Pool	Halls Marching	Bands	through	the	Ages Understanding	the	Think	System  You	can	easily	create	a	slide	that	lists	all	four	presentations	and	contains	hyperlinks	to them.	The	person	viewing	the	slide	show	simply	clicks	a	hyperlink,	and	off	he	or	she goes	to	the	appropriate	presentation. Here	are	a	few	additional	thoughts	to	ponder	concerning	hyperlinks:  	Hyperlinks	aren’t	limited	to	PowerPoint	presentations.	In	PowerPoint, you	can	create	a	hyperlink	that	leads	to	other	types	of	Microsoft	Office	documents,   such	as	Word	documents	or	Excel	spreadsheets.	When	the	person	viewing	the	slide show	clicks	one	of	these	hyperlinks,	PowerPoint	automatically	runs	Word	or	Excel to	open	the	document	or	spreadsheet. A	hyperlink	can	also	lead	to	a	page	on	the	World	Wide	Web.	When	the	user clicks	the	hyperlink,	PowerPoint	runs	Internet	Explorer	to	connect	to	the	Internet and	displays	the	web	page.  	Hyperlinks	work	only	when	the	presentation	is	shown	in	Slide	Show  View.	You	can	click	a	hyperlink	all	you	want	while	in	Outline	View	or	Slide	Sorter View,	and	the	only	thing	that	happens	is	that	your	finger	gets	tired.	Links	are	active when	viewing	the	slide	show.	In	Normal	View,	you	can	activate	a	link	by	right- clicking	it	and	choosing	Open	Hyperlink.  Creating	a	hyperlink	to	another	slide Adding	a	hyperlink	to	a	presentation	is	easy.	Just	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Select	the	text	or	graphic	object	that	you	want	to	make	into	a	hyperlink.  The	most	common	type	of	hyperlink	is	based	on	a	word	or	two	of	text	in	a	slide’s body	text	area.  2.	 Choose	Insert ⇒ Links ⇒ Hyperlink.  Alternatively,	click	the	Insert	Hyperlink	button	found	on	the	standard	toolbar	or	use the	keyboard	shortcut	Ctrl+K.	One	way	or	the	other,	the	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog box,	shown	in	Figure	16-11,	appears. The	dialog	box	has	four	icons	on	the	left	side,	as	follows:  Existing	File	or	Web	Page:	You	can	link	to	another	file	in	another application,	or	to	a	web	page	on	the	Internet. Place	in	This	Document:	You	can	link	one	part	of	your	PowerPoint presentation	to	another	part. Create	New	Document:	You	can,	however,	choose	now	or	another	time	to edit	the	new	document	by	clicking	the	appropriate	button. E-mail	Address:	Use	this	to	link	to	an	email	address.	This	feature	is	useful	in an	intranet	or	Internet	setting	because	this	link	allows	the	reader	to	write	an email	to	the	email	address	that	you	link	to.  3.	 Click	the	Place	in	This	Document	icon	on	the	left	side	of	the	dialog	box.  A	list	of	the	slides	in	the	current	presentation	appears	in	the	dialog	box.  4.	 Click	the	slide	that	you	want	the	hyperlink	to	lead	to	and	then	click	OK.  The	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog	box	vanishes,	and	the	hyperlink	is	created.   Figure	16-11:	The	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog	box.  If	you	selected	text	in	Step	1,	the	text	changes	color	and	is	underlined.	If	you	selected	a graphical	object,	the	picture	isn’t	highlighted	in	any	way	to	indicate	that	it	is	a hyperlink.	However,	the	cursor	always	changes	to	a	pointing	hand	whenever	it	passes over	a	hyperlink	in	Slide	Show	View	or	Reading	View,	thus	providing	a	visual	clue	that the	user	has	found	a	hyperlink. Creating	a	hyperlink	to	another	presentation	or	to a	website Creating	a	hyperlink	that	opens	another	presentation	is	much	like	the	procedure described	in	the	preceding	section,	“Creating	a	hyperlink	to	another	slide,”	but	with	a couple	important	differences:  1.	 Select	the	text	or	graphical	object	that	you	want	to	make	into	a	hyperlink. 2.	 Click	the	Hyperlink	button	in	the	Links	group	on	the	Insert	tab.  The	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog	box	appears	 refer	to	Figure	16-11 .  3.	 Click	the	Existing	File	or	Web	Page	icon	in	the	list	of	icons	on	the	left	side	of  the	dialog	box.  	You	can	also	link	to	a	specific	slide	within	another	presentation	by	clicking  the	Bookmark	button	in	the	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog	box.	This	brings	up	another dialog	box	listing	the	slides	in	the	selected	presentation.	Choose	the	slide	you	want to	link	to;	then	click	OK	to	return	to	the	Insert	Hyperlink	dialog	box.  4.	 Click	Current	Folder. 5.	 Select	the	file	that	you	want	to	link	to.  You	might	have	to	rummage	about	your	hard	drive	to	find	the	presentation.   	The	presentation	that	you	link	to	doesn’t	have	to	be	in	the	same	folder	or  even	on	the	same	drive	as	the	current	presentation.	In	fact,	you	can	link	to	a presentation	that	resides	on	a	network	file	server.  6.	 Click	OK.  When	you	follow	a	link	to	another	presentation,	PowerPoint	automatically	opens	the other	presentation.	This	means	that	you	now	have	both	presentations	open.	When you’re	finished	viewing	the	second	presentation,	close	it	to	return	to	the	original presentation. If	you	want	to	create	a	hyperlink	to	an	existing	web	page,	just	type	the	address	of	the web	page	in	your	outline	or	on	your	slide	and	a	hyperlink	automatically	appears.	You can	select	any	page	of	a	website	as	long	as	you	know	the	URL	for	that	specific	page.  	To	remove	a	hyperlink,	right-click	the	hyperlink	that	you	want	to	zap	and	then  choose	Remove	Hyperlink	from	the	menu	that	appears.	To	change	a	hyperlink, right-click	it	and	choose	Edit	Hyperlink.   Adding	Action	Buttons  An	action	button	is	a	special	type	of	AutoShape	that	places	a	button	on	the	slide.	When the	user	clicks	the	button	during	a	slide	show,	PowerPoint	takes	whatever	action	you’ve designated	for	the	button.	A	well-planned	arrangement	of	action	buttons	scattered throughout	a	presentation	can	make	it	easy	for	someone	to	view	the	presentation	in	any order	he	or	she	wants. The	following	sections	describe	how	action	buttons	work	and	show	you	how	to	add them	to	your	presentations. Assigning	button	actions When	you	create	an	action	button,	you	assign	both	a	shape	for	the	button	 you	have	12 shapes	to	choose	from;	the	shapes	are	described	a	bit	later	in	this	section 	and	an	action to	be	taken	when	the	user	clicks	the	button	or	merely	points	the	cursor	at	it.	The	action for	a	button	can	be	any	of	the	following:  Activate	a	hyperlink:	This	is	the	most	common	button	action.	It	causes	a	different slide	in	the	current	presentation,	a	different	presentation	altogether,	a	non- PowerPoint	document,	or	even	an	Internet	web	page	to	appear. Run	a	program:	For	example,	you	can	set	up	a	button	that	runs	Microsoft	Word	or Excel.  	Run	a	macro:	PowerPoint	lets	you	create	macros,	which	are	programs  written	in	a	powerful	programming	language	called	Visual	Basic	for	Applications.  	Object	action:	PowerPoint	lets	you	insert	OLE	objects	into	your  presentation	by	using	the	Insert	Object	command,	found	on	the	Insert	tab	just	to	the right	of	the	WordArt	icon.	An	OLE	object	is	a	way	to	insert	content	from	another program,	such	as	Microsoft	Excel,	Word,	or	Outlook.	If	you’ve	inserted	an	OLE object	into	your	presentation,	you	can	use	a	hyperlink	to	trigger	an	action	on	the OLE	object.	For	example,	you	can	insert	an	Action	button	that	will	open	an	Excel spreadsheet	object	in	Excel. Play	a	sound:	This	is	just	one	way	to	add	sound	to	a	PowerPoint	presentation.	For more	ways,	refer	to	Chapter	15.  Choosing	button	shapes PowerPoint	provides	a	selection	of	built-in	shapes	for	action	buttons.	Table	16-2	lists the	action	button	shapes	that	you	can	place	in	your	presentation	and	indicates	what	type of	action	is	associated	with	each	type.   Table	16-2	Action	Buttons  Button	Image Name  What	the	Button	Does  Back	or	Previous Displays	the	preceding	slide	in	the	presentation  Forward	or	Next Displays	the	next	slide	in	the	presentation  Beginning  Displays	the	first	slide	in	the	presentation  End  Displays	the	last	slide	in	the	presentation  Home  Displays	the	first	slide	in	the	presentation  Information  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Return  Displays	the	most	recently	viewed	slide  Movie  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Document  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Sound  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Help  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Custom  No	default	action	for	this	button	type  Creating	a	button To	add	a	button	to	a	slide,	follow	these	steps:   1.	 Move	to	the	slide	on	which	you	want	to	place	a	button. 2.	 Open	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Shapes	button	in	the	Illustrations  group,	and	select	one	of	the	Action	Button	shapes	found	at	the	bottom	of	the gallery	that	appears.  3.	 Draw	the	button	on	the	slide.  Start	by	pointing	to	the	spot	where	you	want	the	upper-left	corner	of	the	button	to appear.	Then	click	and	drag	to	where	you	want	the	lower-right	corner	of	the	button to	appear. When	you	release	the	mouse	button,	the	Action	Settings	dialog	box	appears,	as shown	in	Figure	16-12.  4.	 If	you	want,	change	the	action	settings	for	the	action	button.  In	most	cases,	the	default	setting	for	the	action	button	that	you	chose	is	appropriate for	what	you	want	the	button	to	do.	For	example,	the	action	setting	for	a	Forward	or Next	button	is	Hyperlink	to	Next	Slide.	If	you	want	the	slide	to	hyperlink	to	some other	location,	change	the	Hyperlink	To	setting.  5.	 Click	OK.  The	Action	Settings	dialog	box	vanishes,	and	the	button	is	created.  Figure	16-12:	The	Action	Settings	dialog	box.  Here	are	some	additional	thoughts	concerning	action	buttons:  Change	the	look	of	a	button:	You	can	format	action	buttons	like	any	other	shape object.	Therefore,	you	can	use	Drawing	Tools	on	the	Ribbon	to	apply	fill	colors, line	styles,	or	shape	effects	such	as	bevels	and	3-D	rotations.	For	more	information,   refer	to	Chapter	12. Move	a	button:	To	move	a	button,	just	click	it	to	select	it.	Then	use	the	mouse	to drag	the	button	to	a	new	location. Change	the	action	setting	for	a	button:	You	can	change	the	action	setting	for	a button	by	right-clicking	the	button	and	choosing	the	Action	Settings	command.  Creating	a	navigation	toolbar Grouping	action	buttons	into	a	navigation	toolbar	makes	a	slide	show	easy	to	navigate. You	can	add	a	set	of	navigation	buttons	to	the	bottom	of	your	Slide	Master.	Figure	16- 13	shows	a	slide	with	navigation	buttons	in	the	lower-right	corner.	These	buttons	make getting	around	the	show	a	snap.	For	this	example,	I	use	Beginning,	Backward  Previous ,	Forward	 Next ,	and	Ending	buttons,	but	you	can	include	any	buttons	you want.  Figure	16-13:	A	slide	with	navigation	buttons.  To	create	a	navigation	toolbar	that	appears	on	every	slide,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Switch	to	Slide	Master	View.  From	the	View	tab	on	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Slide	Master	button	in	the	Presentation Views	group.	Or	if	you	like	shortcuts,	hold	down	the	Shift	key	and	click	the Normal	View	button	in	the	lower-left	corner	of	the	PowerPoint	window.  2.	 Create	the	action	buttons	that	you	want	to	include.  Follow	the	procedure	described	in	the	preceding	section,	“Creating	a	button,”	to create	each	button.	Make	sure	that	all	the	buttons	are	the	same	size	and	line	them up	to	create	a	tight	cluster	of	buttons.   	You	can	easily	duplicate	a	button	by	holding	down	the	Ctrl	key	while	you  drag	the	button	to	a	new	location.	This	technique	makes	it	easy	to	create	several similar	buttons,	such	as	navigation	buttons.  3.	 Return	to	Normal	View.  Click	the	Normal	View	button	or	click	the	Normal	button	in	the	Presentation	Views group	on	the	View	tab.  The	buttons	that	you	created	appear	on	every	slide	in	your	presentation.   Inserting	Equations  Steven	Hawking	has	said	that	his	editor	told	him	that	every	mathematical	equation	he included	in	his	classic	book	A	Brief	History	of	Time	would	cut	the	book’s	sales	in	half. So	he	included	just	one:	the	classic	e=mc2.	See	how	easy	that	equation	was	to	type? The	only	trick	was	remembering	how	to	format	the	little	2	as	a	superscript. My	editor	promised	me	that	every	equation	I	included	in	this	book	would	double	its sales,	but	I	didn’t	believe	her,	not	even	for	a	nanosecond.	Just	in	case,	Figure	16-14 shows	some	examples	of	the	equations	you	can	create	by	using	PowerPoint’s	handy- dandy	Equation	feature.	You	wouldn’t	even	consider	using	ordinary	text	to	try	to	create these	equations,	but	they	took	me	only	a	few	minutes	to	create	with	the	Equation	tool. Aren’t	they	cool?	Tell	all	your	friends	about	the	cool	equations	you	saw	in	this	book	so that	they’ll	all	rush	out	and	buy	copies	for	themselves.  Figure	16-14:	These	equations	will	probably	not	affect	the	sales	of	this	book	one	way	or	another.  You	don’t	have	to	know	anything	about	math	to	use	PowerPoint.	I	don’t	have	a	clue what	most	of	the	equations	in	Figure	16-14	do,	but	they	sure	look	great,	don’t	they?  	Don’t	forget	to	tell	your	friends	how	great	the	equations	in	Figure	16-14	are.  Those	alone	are	worth	the	price	of	the	book. To	add	an	equation	to	a	slide,	follow	these	steps:   1.	 Click	the	Insert	tab	of	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	Equation	button	 found in	the	Symbols	section 	to	reveal	the	gallery	of	equations,	as	shown	in	Figure 16-15.  2.	 If	one	of	the	preformatted	equations	in	the	gallery	meets	your	needs,	select	it.  Otherwise,	select	Insert	New	Equation	found	at	the	bottom	of	the	gallery. The	rest	of	this	procedure	assumes	that	you’ve	chosen	to	insert	a	new	equation.	A placeholder	for	the	equation	appears	in	the	slide,	and	the	Equation	Tools	Design	tab appears	on	the	Ribbon,	as	shown	in	Figure	16-16.  3.	 Start	typing	your	equation.  PowerPoint	watches	any	text	you	type	in	an	equation	and	does	its	level	best	to figure	out	how	the	text	should	be	formatted.	If	you	type	the	letter	x,	for	example, PowerPoint	assumes	that	you	intend	for	it	to	be	a	variable,	so	the	x	is	displayed	in italics.	If	you	type	cos,	PowerPoint	assumes	that	you	mean	the	cosine	function,	so the	text	is	not	italicized.	If	you	use	the	mathematical	operators	+,	–,	*,	and	 , PowerPoint	will	automatically	format	them	using	the	equivalent	equation	symbols. Don’t	worry	about	how	the	equation	is	formatted.	When	you	press	Enter, PowerPoint	formats	the	equation	automatically.	For	example,	suppose	you	enter	the following: a	=	 b	+	2c 	 	2b When	you	press	Enter,	the	equation	is	formatted	as	follows:  4.	 To	add	a	symbol	that’s	not	on	the	keyboard,	use	one	of	the	buttons	in	the  Symbols	section	of	the	Equation	Tools	Design	tab. The	Symbols	section	contains	a	gallery	of	mathematical	symbols	most	of	which only	Robert	Oppenheimer	could	understand.	To	use	this	gallery,	first	click	the	More button	in	the	bottom-right	corner	of	the	Symbols	section.	Then	choose	the	symbol category	from	the	drop-down	menu	that	appears	at	the	top	of	the	gallery.	For example,	Figure	16-17	shows	the	Operators	gallery.	Additional	galleries	contain basic	math	symbols,	Greek	letters,	negated	relations,	and	other	obscure	symbols.  5.	 To	create	symbols	stacked	upon	each	other	in	various	ways,	use	the	controls	in  the	Structures	section	of	the	Equation	Tools	Design	tab. Each	button	in	the	Structures	section	reveals	a	gallery	of	structures	that	you	can	use to	create	equations	with	stacked	symbols.	Most	structures	include	a	symbol	and	one or	more	slots,	in	which	you	type	text	or	insert	other	symbols	or	other	structures.	For example,	Figure	16-18	shows	the	gallery	of	templates	that	are	displayed	when	you click	the	Radical	button.	These	structures	let	you	insert	a	square-root	sign	along with	slots	in	front	of	and	inside	the	sign.   6.	 When	you’re	done,	click	outside	of	the	equation	to	return	to	the	slide.  Figure	16-15:	Inserting	an	equation.   Figure	16-16:	Creating	a	new	equation  Figure	16-17:	The	Operators	symbol	gallery.   Figure	16-18:	The	Radical	structures	gallery.  Confused?	I	don’t	blame	you.	After	you	latch	on	to	the	idea	behind	structures,	you	can slap	together	even	the	most	complex	equations	in	no	time.	But	the	learning	curve	here is	steep.	Stick	with	it. Here	are	a	few	additional	points	to	keep	in	mind	when	editing	equations:  Spend	some	time	exploring	the	symbols	and	structures	available	on	the	Equation Tools	Design	tab.	There’s	enough	stuff	here	to	create	a	presentation	on	how	to	build your	own	atomic	bomb.	 None	of	the	equations	in	Figure	16-14	have	anything	to	do with	atomic	bombs.	Honest.  Don’t	use	the	spacebar	to	separate	elements	in	an	equation	—	let	PowerPoint	worry about	how	much	space	to	leave	between	the	variables	and	the	plus	signs.	The	only time	you	should	use	the	spacebar	is	when	you’re	typing	two	or	more	words	of	text and	you	need	the	space	to	separate	the	words. The	Enter	key	has	an	interesting	behavior	in	an	equation:	It	adds	a	new	equation slot,	immediately	beneath	the	current	slot.	This	technique	is	sometimes	a	good	way to	create	stacked	items.  	The	denominator	is	the	bottom	part	of	a	fraction,	not	an	Arnold  Schwarzenegger	movie.   Part	IV   Working	with	Others  	Learn	how	to	add	comments	to	a	slide	when	working	collaboratively	with	others  on	a	presentation	at	www.dummies.com extras powerpoint2016.    In	this	part	…  	Find	out	about	the	several	simple	PowerPoint	tools	that	let	you	distribute	your presentation	to	others	and	allow	others	to	add	comments	to	the	presentation	so	you can	get	their	feedback. 	Understand	how	to	reuse	slides,	including	how	to	set	up	and	use	a	slide	library. 	Discover	how	to	use	a	variety	of	PowerPoint	features	that	let	you	save	your presentations	in	formats	other	than	the	standard	PowerPoint	file	format.   Chapter	17   Collaborating	in	the	Cloud  In	This	Chapter  	Saving	a	presentation	to	the	cloud 	Inviting	others	to	view	or	edit	a	shared	presentation 	Sending	your	presentation	via	email 	Adding	comments	to	a	presentation 	Comparing	changes	in	a	revised	version	of	a	presentation  Works	well	with	others”	is	more	than	standard	fare	for	rookie	resumes.	It’s	also	one	of the	PowerPoint	mantras.	Many	presentations	are	designed	not	by	and	for	a	single presenter,	but	by	a	team	of	presenters.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint	includes	several	simple tools	that	let	you	distribute	your	presentation	to	others	and	allow	others	to	add comments	to	the	presentation	so	you	can	get	their	feedback. This	chapter	shows	you	how	to	use	those	features.   Sharing	a	Presentation	in	the	Cloud  Recently,	the	term	cloud	computing	has	become	one	of	the	most	popular	of	all computer	buzzwords.	Cloud	computing	refers	to	the	idea	of	not	being	limited	to	local computer	resources	 such	as	disc	storage	or	CPU	cycles ,	but	instead	taking	advantage of	the	nearly	limitless	resources	that	are	available	to	you	via	the	cloud	 a.k.a.	the Internet . Microsoft	has	integrated	cloud	computing	into	PowerPoint	2016	by	providing	its	own dedicated	cloud	storage	resource,	called	OneDrive,	and	designating	it	as	one	of	the primary	places	you	can	store	your	PowerPoint	presentations.	 OneDrive	used	to	be called	SkyDrive,	but	Microsoft	had	to	change	the	name	because	of	a	trademark lawsuit.  When	you	install	Office	2016,	you	are	given	the	opportunity	to	create	a	free	OneDrive account	that	offers	up	to	15GB	of	free	cloud	storage,	with	the	capability	to	purchase additional	storage.	If	you	subscribe	to	Office	365,	you	get	1TB	of	cloud	storage. In	addition	to	storing	PowerPoint	presentations	on	OneDrive,	you	can	also	share	your presentations	with	other	OneDrive	users	so	that	you	can	collaboratively	view	and	edit your	work.	Before	you	can	share	a	presentation	with	another	user,	you	must	first	save the	presentation	to	your	OneDrive	account.	To	do	so,	just	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Choose	File ⇒ Save	As.  The	Save	As	page	appears,	which	offers	several	locations	to	which	the	presentation can	be	saved,	as	shown	in	Figure	17-1.	The	default	location	is	your	OneDrive account.  2.	 Click	the	OneDrive	location	where	you	want	to	store	your	presentation.  The	Save	As	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	17-2.	As	you	can	see,	this dialog	box	automatically	navigates	to	your	OneDrive	account’s	Documents	folder.  3.	 Navigate	to	another	OneDrive	folder	or	create	a	new	OneDrive	folder.  You	can	navigate	OneDrive	as	if	it	were	a	local	hard	drive.	And	you	can	create	a new	folder	by	clicking	the	New	Folder	button.  4.	 Change	the	filename	and	then	click	Save. The	presentation	is	saved	to	your	OneDrive.   Figure	17-1:	Saving	a	presentation.  Figure	17-2:	Browsing	to	your	OneDrive	Documents	folder.   Sharing	a	Presentation	with	Other	Users  You	can	easily	share	a	presentation	with	a	friend	or	colleague	by	sending	an	invitation via	email.	The	invitation	email	will	include	a	link	that	will	open	the	presentation	in	a web-based	version	of	PowerPoint	called	the	PowerPoint	Web	App.	From	the PowerPoint	Web	App,	the	user	can	view	the	presentation.	If	the	user	has	PowerPoint installed	on	his	or	her	computer,	the	user	can	also	open	the	presentation	in	PowerPoint, edit	the	presentation,	add	comments	 as	described	later	in	this	chapter ,	and	save	the edited	presentation	in	the	original	OneDrive	location. Here	are	the	steps	to	send	an	invitation:  1.	 Save	your	presentation	to	OneDrive. 2.	 Choose	File ⇒ Share	and	then	click	Share	with	People.  You	are	returned	to	the	presentation	with	the	Share	task	pane	open,	as	shown	in Figure	17-3.	The	Share	with	People	page	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	17-3.	From this	page,	you	can	craft	an	email	message	that	will	be	sent	to	the	people	with	whom you’d	like	to	share	the	presentation.  3.	 Type	one	or	more	email	addresses	in	the	Invite	People	text	box.  If	you	have	more	than	one	email	address,	just	separate	the	addresses	with	commas or	semicolons.  	You	can	click	the	Address	Book	icon	to	the	right	of	the	text	box	to	bring	up your	address	book.	Then,	you	can	select	names	from	your	address	book	rather	than type	the	email	addresses	manually.  4.	 Choose	the	sharing	permission	you	want	to	grant.  The	two	options	are	Can	Edit	and	Can	View.	Use	the	drop-down	list	below	the Invite	People	text	box	to	select	the	permission.  5.	 If	you	wish,	type	a	message	in	the	Include	a	Message	[Optional]	with	the  Invitation	text	box. The	message	is	included	in	the	email	that	is	sent	to	the	recipients.  6.	 Click	Share.  A	confirmation	message	appears,	indicating	that	the	emails	have	been	sent.   Figure	17-3:	Sending	an	invitation.  Figure	17-4	shows	a	typical	invitation	email.  Figure	17-4:	An	invitation	to	a	shared	PowerPoint	presentation.  To	open	a	shared	presentation	in	PowerPoint	Web	App,	simply	click	the	link	in	the invitation.	Figure	17-5	shows	a	presentation	opened	in	Web	App.	You	can	view	the entire	presentation	in	Web	App,	or	you	can	open	the	presentation	in	PowerPoint	by clicking	the	Open	in	PowerPoint	button.	 Note	that	to	open	the	presentation	in PowerPoint,	you	must	have	a	copy	of	PowerPoint	installed	on	your	computer.    Figure	17-5:	A	shared	presentation	open	in	the	PowerPoint	Web	App.  	If	you	want	to	manually	send	your	own	email	with	a	link	that	allows	users	to  view	or	edit	your	presentation,	you	can	choose	File ⇒ Share ⇒ Get	a	Sharing	Link. This	displays	a	page	that	allows	you	to	create	a	View	Link	or	an	Edit	Link,	which you	can	then	copy	and	paste	as	needed.   Sending	Slides	for	Review	Via	Email  Another	way	to	share	a	presentation	with	colleagues	is	to	simply	email	them	a	copy	of the	presentation.	PowerPoint	includes	a	built-in	feature	for	doing	that.	Here	are	the steps:  1.	 Open	the	presentation	that	you	want	to	send	out	for	review.  If	the	presentation	is	already	open,	choose	File ⇒ Save	to	save	any	changes	you made	since	you	opened	it.  2.	 Choose	File ⇒ Share ⇒ Email.  PowerPoint	displays	the	page	shown	in	Figure	17-6,	which	offers	five	options	for sending	the	file.	The	five	options	are  Send	as	Attachment:	This	is	the	most	commonly	used	option.	It	simply creates	an	email	message	with	the	presentation	file	inserted	as	an attachment. Send	a	link:	This	option	works	best	if	you’ve	saved	the	presentation	to OneDrive.	It	then	creates	an	email	that	contains	a	link	that	the	recipient	can click	to	open	the	presentation. Send	as	PDF:	This	option	creates	a	PDF	version	of	the	presentation,	and then	creates	an	email	that	contains	the	PDF	version	as	an	attachment. Send	as	XPS:	This	option	creates	an	XPS	version	of	the	presentation	 XPS	is Microsoft’s	attempt	at	competing	with	PDF 	and	then	creates	an	email	that contains	the	XPS	version	as	an	attachment. Send	as	Internet	Fax:	If	you	have	an	account	with	an	Internet	fax	service, you	can	use	this	option	to	send	a	fax	of	your	presentation.	 This	option would	be	more	useful	in	today’s	world	if	it	could	also	send	your	presentation back	in	time,	so	that,	for	example,	the	recipient	would	receive	the	fax	in 1983	—	when	faxing	was	popular.   3.	 Click	the	option	you	want	to	use	to	send	the	email.  Outlook	fires	up	and	creates	an	email	message	with	the	correct	attachment	or	link, depending	on	which	option	you	choose.  4.	 In	the	To	field,	add	an	email	address	for	each	person	to	whom	you	want	to  send	a	review	copy. You	can	type	the	email	addresses	directly	into	the	To	field,	or	you	can	click	the	To button	to	open	the	Address	Book.	You	can	then	use	the	Address	Book	to	select	your reviewers. If	you	want	to	send	the	presentation	to	more	than	one	person,	separate	the	email addresses	with	semicolons.   5.	 If	you	want,	change	the	Subject	field	or	message	body.  By	default,	PowerPoint	uses	the	filename	as	the	message’s	subject	and	leaves	the message	body	blank.	You	probably	want	to	say	something	a	little	more	cordial.  6.	 Set	any	other	email	options	you	want	for	the	message.  Depending	on	the	program	you	use	for	your	email,	you	have	a	bevy	of	options	to set	for	email	messages,	such	as	high	or	low	priority,	signatures,	stationery,	read receipts,	plain	or	HTML	formatting,	and	more.  7.	 Click	the	Send	button.  Your	message	is	whisked	away	and	will	be	delivered	as	soon	as	possible.  Figure	17-6:	Sending	a	presentation	via	email.   Using	Comments  So	far	in	this	chapter,	I’ve	showed	you	several	ways	to	share	a	presentation	with	others so	that	two	or	more	people	can	collaborate	on	a	document.	But	after	the	presentation has	been	shared,	what	exactly	can	you	do	to	work	collaboratively?	In	this	section,	I show	you	one	of	the	best	ways	to	collaborate	—	by	adding	comments	to	a	presentation. A	comment	is	a	lot	like	a	sticky	note.	The	beauty	of	comments	is	that	you	can	turn them	on	and	off.	Therefore,	you	can	view	the	comments	while	you’re	editing	your presentation,	and	you	can	turn	them	off	when	it’s	time	for	the	show. To	add	a	comment	to	a	presentation,	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Call	up	the	slide	to	which	you	want	to	add	a	comment. 2.	 Click	where	you	want	the	comment	to	appear.  You	can	click	anywhere	in	the	slide.  3.	 Open	the	Review	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	New	Comment	button. A	comment	bubble	appears	on	the	slide,	and	the	Comments	task	pane	opens	to	the right	of	the	slide.  4.	 Type	whatever	you	want	in	the	Comment	pane.  Offer	some	constructive	criticism.	Suggest	an	alternative	approach.	Or	just comment	on	the	weather.	Figure	17-7	shows	a	completed	comment.  5.	 If	you	want,	move	the	comment	bubble.  You	can	move	the	comment	closer	to	the	slide	item	on	which	you’re	commenting by	dragging	the	comment	tag	around	the	slide.  Figure	17-7:	Creating	a	comment.   Here	are	some	additional	thoughts	concerning	working	with	comments:  To	view	a	comment,	click	the	comment	bubble. To	change	a	comment,	click	the	comment	in	the	Comments	pane	and	then	edit	the text	in	the	comment	until	you’re	satisfied. You	can	move	a	comment	by	dragging	it.	Note	that	comments	are	not	attached	to any	particular	slide	object	or	text.	Therefore,	if	you	move	a	comment	near	the	text or	object	that	the	comment	applies	to	and	then	edit	the	slide	so	that	the	text	or object	moves,	the	comment	will	not	move	along	with	the	text	or	object.	You	have	to manually	move	the	comment	if	you	want	it	to	stay	near	the	text	or	object	it	applies to. To	delete	a	comment,	click	the	comment	to	select	it	and	then	press	Delete. To	delete	all	the	comments	on	a	particular	slide,	click	the	down	arrow	beneath	the Delete	button	on	the	Review	tab.	Then	choose	Delete	All	Markup	on	the	Current Slide. To	delete	all	the	comments	in	a	presentation,	click	the	down	arrow	beneath	the Delete	button	and	choose	Delete	All	Markup	in	This	Presentation. You	can	quickly	scan	through	all	the	comments	in	a	PowerPoint	presentation	by using	the	Previous	and	Next	buttons	on	the	Review	tab	on	the	Ribbon. You	can	use	the	Show	Comments	button	on	the	Review	tab	to	show	or	hide comments	from	a	presentation.   Comparing	Presentations  The	Compare	feature	lets	you	compare	the	differences	between	two	versions	of	a presentation	and	accept	or	reject	the	differences.	This	feature	is	useful	if	you’ve	sent	a copy	of	the	presentation	to	a	reviewer	and	you	want	to	selectively	incorporate	the reviewer’s	changes. Using	the	Compare	feature	is	easy.	Here	are	the	steps:  1.	 Open	the	original	version	of	the	presentation. 2.	 On	the	Review	tab	of	the	Ribbon,	click	the	Compare	button.  A	dialog	box	appears	that	lets	you	open	the	revised	version	of	the	presentation. 3.	 Navigate	to	the	revised	version	of	the	presentation,	select	it,	and	click	Open.  This	action	opens	the	revised	version	of	the	presentation	and	merges	the	two presentations	together,	keeping	track	of	the	differences	between	the	original presentation	and	the	revised	version. The	differences	between	the	original	and	the	revised	versions	are	highlighted,	as shown	in	Figure	17-8.	As	you	can	see,	the	revisions	are	shown	as	check	boxes, which	allow	you	to	select	the	individual	changes	you	want	to	accept	or	reject.	You can	also	select	the	All	Changes	…	check	box	to	accept	or	reject	all	the	changes	for a	given	object.  4.	 Use	the	check	boxes	to	select	the	changes	you	want	to	accept	or	reject;	then  click	either	Accept	or	Reject	on	the	Review	tab	of	the	Ribbon. If	you	click	Accept,	the	selected	changes	are	incorporated	into	the	drawing.	If	you click	Reject,	the	original	version	of	the	selected	changes	is	restored.  5.	 Click	the	Next	button	found	in	the	Compare	section	of	the	Review	tab	to	move  6.	 Repeat	Steps	4	and	5	until	you	have	accepted	or	rejected	all	the	edits	to	the  to	the	next	set	of	edits.  presentation.  7.	 Click	the	End	Review	button	 in	the	Compare	group	of	the	Review	tab	of	the  Ribbon 	when	you’re	finished. This	step	hides	any	remaining	edits	that	you	haven’t	yet	accepted	or	rejected.  8.	 Save	the	presentation.   Figure	17-8:	PowerPoint	shows	the	differences	between	the	original	and	revised	versions	of	a	presentation.   Chapter	18   Using	a	Slide	Library	and	Other	Ways	to  Reuse	Slides  In	This	Chapter  	Stealing	slides	from	another	presentation 	Saving	slides	in	a	slide	library 	Stealing	slides	from	a	slide	library  What	do	you	do	when	you’re	plodding	along	in	PowerPoint	and	realize	that	the	slides you’re	trying	to	create	probably	already	exist	in	some	other	presentation	somewhere? You	do	what	I	do:	You	borrow	the	slides	from	the	other	presentation.	This	chapter shows	you	how	to	do	that. Note	that	in	the	old	days,	the	only	way	to	steal	slides	from	another	presentation	was	to get	on	your	horse	and	chase	down	the	other	presentation	 that	is,	find	the	presentation on	your	hard	drive ,	jump	on	board	 open	the	presentation ,	and	steal	the	slides	at gunpoint	 copy	the	slides	you	want	to	steal	and	paste	them	into	the	new	presentation .  You	can	still	steal	slides	that	way	—	in	fact,	Microsoft	has	created	a	special	command that	makes	it	easy	to	steal	slides	directly	from	another	presentation.	But	if	you	steal slides	often	and	want	to	become	a	career	criminal,	the	real	way	to	do	it	is	to	set	up	a slide	library,	which	is	a	central	repository	for	slides.	The	slide	library	lives	on	a	server, so	anyone	can	access	it,	and	it’s	managed	by	SharePoint,	so	it	has	a	bunch	of	nice SharePoint-like	features.   Stealing	Slides	from	Another	Presentation  Stealing	slides	from	another	presentation	isn’t	a	serious	crime.	In	fact,	Microsoft provides	a	special	command	on	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	to	let	you	do	it.	Here	are the	steps:  1.	 Open	the	presentation	you	want	to	copy	slides	into	 not	the	one	you	want	to  steal	the	slides	from .  2.	 Click	the	Home	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	New	Slide	button	and choose	Reuse	Slides.	 Reuse	Slides	appears	at	the	bottom	of	the	New	Slide menu.  This	step	displays	a	Reuse	Slides	task	pane,	which	appears	on	the	right	side	of	the screen,	as	shown	in	Figure	18-1.  3.	 Click	the	Open	a	PowerPoint	File	link	in	the	Reuse	Slides	task	pane.  This	summons	a	Browse	dialog	box.  4.	 Locate	the	presentation	you	want	to	steal	slides	from	and	then	click	Open.  The	slides	from	the	presentation	you	selected	are	displayed	in	the	Reuse	Slides	task pane,	as	shown	in	Figure	18-2.  	You’re	now	privy	to	one	of	the	coolest	effects	in	PowerPoint:	When	you  point	at	one	of	the	slides	in	the	Reuse	Slides	task	pane,	the	slide	magnifies	to	twice its	original	size	so	you	can	better	see	the	contents	of	the	slide.  5.	  Optional 	Select	the	Keep	Source	Formatting	check	box	if	you	want	the	slides  to	retain	their	original	formatting. Normally,	you	should	keep	this	option	deselected.	With	the	option	deselected,	the slide	assumes	the	theme	of	the	presentation	it	is	inserted	into.  6.	 Click	the	slides	you	want	to	steal.  Each	slide	you	click	is	added	to	the	presentation.  7.	 When	you’re	done,	click	the	X	at	the	top	right	of	the	Reuse	Slides	task	pane	to  dismiss	it.   Figure	18-1:	The	Reuse	Slides	task	pane	lets	you	steal	slides	from	other	presentations.  Figure	18-2:	Steal	these	slides!  That’s	about	all	there	is	to	stealing	slides	from	other	presentations.   Saving	Slides	in	a	Slide	Library  If	you’re	lucky	enough	to	work	at	a	company	that	uses	SharePoint,	you	have	several additional	PowerPoint	features	at	your	disposal.	One	of	the	most	useful	is	the	capability to	create	and	use	slide	libraries,	which	are	special	types	of	document	folders	that	store individual	slides,	not	whole	documents.	When	you’ve	saved	slides	in	a	slide	library, you	can	easily	insert	them	into	a	presentation.	And	as	an	added	bonus,	you	can	have PowerPoint	check	to	see	whether	the	slides	have	changed	and	automatically	update them	with	the	changes.	Pretty	cool,	eh? To	save	one	or	more	slides	to	a	slide	library,	you	must	first	create	the	slide	library. That’s	a	task	better	left	to	a	SharePoint	system	administrator,	so	you	can	skip	that	step here.	Instead,	assume	that	the	slide	library	has	already	been	created	for	you,	and	you’ve been	provided	with	the	URL	 that	is,	the	web	address 	of	the	slide	library	and	any	login credentials	you	might	need	to	access	it. Here	are	the	steps	for	adding	slides	to	a	slide	library:  1.	 Open	the	presentation	that	contains	the	slides	you	want	to	add	to	the	library. 2.	 Choose	File ⇒ Share ⇒ Publish	Slides;	then	click	the	Publish	Slides	button. This	step	brings	up	a	dialog	box	that	allows	you	to	select	the	slides	you	want	to share.  3.	 Select	the	slides	you	want	to	add	to	the	library.  To	select	an	individual	slide,	select	the	check	box	next	to	the	slide	thumbnail.	To select	all	the	slides	in	the	presentation,	click	the	Select	All	button. 4.	 Enter	the	URL	of	the	slide	library	in	the	Publish	To	text	box.  Or	if	you	prefer,	you	can	click	the	Browse	button	to	browse	to	the	library.  5.	 Click	the	Publish	button.  The	slides	are	copied	to	the	slide	library.  6.	  Optional 	Play	a	game	of	Solitaire.  Depending	on	the	speed	of	your	local	network	and	how	many	slides	you	selected, PowerPoint	might	take	a	while	to	publish	the	slides	 probably	not	long	enough	for	a game	of	Solitaire,	but	your	boss	doesn’t	have	to	know	that . You’re	done!  The	slides	have	now	been	added	to	the	library.   Stealing	Slides	from	a	Slide	Library  To	incorporate	a	slide	from	a	SharePoint	slide	library	into	a	presentation,	just	follow these	steps:  1.	 Open	the	presentation	you	want	to	copy	slides	into	 not	the	one	you	want	to  steal	the	slides	from .  2.	 Click	the	Insert	tab	on	the	Ribbon	and	then	click	the	New	Slide	button	and  choose	Reuse	Slides. This	step	displays	a	Reuse	Slides	task	pane	 refer	to	Figure	18-1 .  3.	 Click	the	Open	a	Slide	Library	link	in	the	Reuse	Slides	task	pane.  This	step	summons	a	Browse	dialog	box.  4.	 Locate	the	Slide	Library	you	want	to	steal	slides	from	and	then	click	Open.  The	slides	from	the	presentation	you	selected	are	displayed	in	the	Reuse	Slides	task pane,	in	the	same	way	that	slides	from	a	PowerPoint	file	are	shown.	Refer	to	Figure 18-2.  5.	  Optional 	To	keep	the	original	formatting	for	the	slides,	select	the	Keep  Source	Formatting	check	box. Normally,	you	should	keep	this	option	deselected.  6.	 Click	the	slides	you	want	to	steal.  Each	slide	you	click	is	added	to	the	presentation.  7.	 When	you’re	done,	click	the	X	at	the	top	right	of	the	Reuse	Slides	task	pane	to  dismiss	it.   Chapter	19   Exporting	Your	Presentation	to	Other  Formats  In	This	Chapter  	Exporting	to	PDF 	Exporting	to	a	video 	Exporting	to	a	Word	document  This	chapter	shows	you	how	to	use	a	variety	of	PowerPoint	features	that	let	you	save your	presentations	in	formats	other	than	the	standard	PowerPoint	file	format.	You	can save	your	presentation	as	a	PDF	file,	which	can	then	be	viewed	using	Adobe’s	Acrobat software.	Or,	you	can	create	a	video	that	can	be	viewed	over	the	web,	using	a	media player,	or	even	on	a	DVD	that	can	be	played	on	a	standard	DVD	player.	You	can	also create	a	self-contained	presentation	that	can	be	saved	to	a	CD	or	flash	drive	and	viewed with	a	free	PowerPoint	viewer.	And	finally,	you	can	convert	a	presentation	to	a	Word document	that	you	can	give	to	your	attendees	as	handouts. All	these	features	are	available	from	the	File ⇒ Export	page.   Creating	a	PDF	File  PDF,	which	stands	for	Portable	Document	Format,	is	a	popular	format	for interchanging	files.	You	can	easily	convert	a	PowerPoint	presentation	to	PDF	format	by following	these	steps: 1.	 Choose	File ⇒ Export ⇒ Create	PDF XPS	Document. 2.	 Click	the	Create	PDF XPS	button.  This	brings	up	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	19-1.  3.	 Navigate	to	the	location	where	you	want	to	save	the	file,	and	change	the  filename	if	you	wish. The	default	is	to	save	the	file	in	the	same	folder	as	the	PowerPoint	presentation, using	the	same	name	but	with	the	extension	PDF.  4.	 Select	the	appropriate	optimization	setting.  The	two	choices	are	to	optimize	for	standard	use	or	to	minimize	the	file	size.	The quality	will	be	slightly	reduced	if	you	opt	to	minimize	the	file	size.  5.	 Click	Publish.  The	presentation	is	converted	to	a	PDF	file.  Figure	19-1:	Creating	a	PDF	document.   Crafting	a	Video  PowerPoint	is	great	for	preparing	presentations	to	give	in	person.	But	what	about giving	presentations	when	you	can’t	be	there?	With	digital	video	cameras	practically being	given	away	in	cereal	boxes	these	days,	just	about	anyone	can	record	a	video	of himself	giving	a	presentation.	Wouldn’t	it	be	great	if	you	could	easily	combine	the slides	from	a	PowerPoint	presentation	with	a	video	of	you	presenting	it?	Then	anyone can	watch	the	presentation	later,	when	you	can’t	be	there. Good	news!	Beginning	with	PowerPoint	2016,	you	can!	In	fact,	creating	a	video version	of	your	presentation	is	a	snap.	First,	you	set	up	the	timing	you	want	for	each slide	and	for	each	animation	within	each	slide.	You	can	even	add	a	voice	narration	to each	slide.	After	the	timings	and	narration	are	all	set	up,	you	just	click	a	few	times	with the	mouse,	and	your	presentation	is	converted	to	video. Adding	timings	and	narration PowerPoint	includes	a	nifty	feature	that	lets	you	record	the	timings	for	each	slide	and for	each	animation	element	 such	as	bullet	points	appearing .	At	the	same	time,	you	can record	your	own	voice	to	use	as	a	narration	for	the	presentation. To	record	the	timings,	you	essentially	rehearse	the	presentation	as	if	you	were	giving	it to	an	audience.	PowerPoint	keeps	track	of	the	time	between	each	mouse	click	or	other action	and	records	those	timings	along	with	the	presentation. As	for	the	narration,	you	simply	speak	your	narration	into	a	microphone,	and PowerPoint	attaches	your	recorded	voice	to	each	slide.	Then,	when	you	play	back	the presentation,	the	slides	are	automatically	synchronized	with	the	narrations	you recorded. Note	that	you	can	also	record	PowerPoint’s	built-in	laser	pointer.	Then,	when	you	play back	the	show	or	create	a	video,	the	pointer	will	dance	across	the	screen	automatically! For	more	information	about	using	the	laser	pointer,	refer	to	Chapter	6.  	You	need	a	microphone	plugged	into	your	computer	to	record	narrations.	I recommend	you	get	the	kind	that’s	built	into	a	headset	rather	than	a	hand-held microphone.	The	headset	microphone	will	provide	more	consistent	voice	quality, plus	it	will	leave	your	hands	free	to	work	your	keyboard	and	mouse	while	you record	the	timings,	narration,	and	laser	pointer.  To	record	timings	and	narration,	first	plug	a	microphone	into	your	computer’s microphone	input	jack.	Then,	open	the	presentation	and	follow	these	steps:  1.	 Open	the	Slide	Show	tab,	choose	Record	Slide	Show	and	then	choose	Start  Recording	from	Beginning. The	Record	Slide	Show	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	19-2,	appears.	This	dialog	box   simply	asks	whether	you	want	to	record	slide	timings	or	narration.  2.	 To	record	slide	timings,	select	the	Slide	and	Animation	Timings	check	box.	To record	narrations	and	the	laser	pointer,	select	the	Narrations	Ink,	and	Laser Pointer	check	box. You’ll	almost	always	want	to	select	the	Slide	and	Animation	Timings	check	box.  3.	 Click	OK	to	begin	recording	the	slide	show.  The	first	slide	of	your	presentation	is	displayed,	and	a	small	toolbar	titled Recording	is	displayed,	as	shown	in	Figure	19-3.  4.	 Speak	your	narration	into	the	microphone.	Press	Enter	or	click	the	mouse  button	each	time	you	want	to	advance	to	a	new	slide	or	call	up	a	new animation	element	 such	as	a	bullet	point .  5.	 If	you	want	to	use	the	laser	pointer	on	a	slide,	hold	down	the	Ctrl	key	and	then click	and	hold	the	mouse	button	and	use	the	mouse	to	control	the	laser	pointer. When	you	release	the	mouse	button,	the	laser	pointer	disappears.	 For	more information	about	working	the	laser	pointer,	see	Chapter	6.   6.	 If	you	need	to	pause	the	recording	at	any	time,	click	the	Pause	button	that  appears	in	the	Recording	toolbar. The	recording	is	suspended,	and	a	dialog	box	appears	with	a	button	that	lets	you resume	the	recording.	When	you’re	ready	to	continue,	click	this	button.  7.	 When	you’re	finished	recording,	press	Esc.  Recording	will	automatically	end	when	you	exit	the	last	slide,	so	you	can	skip	this step	if	you	record	the	entire	presentation.  8.	 Switch	to	Slide	Sorter	View.  Slide	Sorter	View	allows	you	to	see	the	timings	associated	with	each	slide,	as shown	in	Figure	19-4.  9.	 If	you	messed	up	on	any	slide,	select	that	slide,	click	Record	Slide	Show,	and then	choose	Start	Recording	from	Current	Slide.	Then	re-record	the	timings and	narration	for	that	slide.	Press	Esc	to	stop	recording. You	can	re-record	more	than	one	slide	in	this	way;	just	press	Enter	or	click	the mouse	to	advance	through	all	the	slides	you	want	to	re-record.	Press	Esc	to	stop recording.  10.	 Press	F5	or	click	the	Slide	Show	button	on	the	right	side	of	the	status	bar	to  begin	the	slide	show	so	you	can	see	whether	your	narration	works. The	slide	show	begins.	The	narration	plays	through	your	computer’s	speakers,	and the	slides	advance	automatically	along	with	the	narration.	The	laser	pointer	should also	appear	if	you	used	it	during	the	recording.   Figure	19-2:	Specify	what	elements	you	want	to	record.  Figure	19-3:	The	Recording	toolbar.  Figure	19-4:	You	can	see	the	slide	timings	in	Slide	Sorter	View.  Here	are	some	additional	things	to	keep	in	mind	about	narrations:  	As	you	record	the	narration,	leave	a	little	gap	between	each	slide.  PowerPoint	records	the	narration	for	each	slide	as	a	separate	sound	file	and	then attaches	the	sound	to	the	slide.	Unfortunately,	you	get	cut	off	if	you	talk	right through	the	slide	transitions. The	narration	cancels	out	any	other	sounds	you	placed	on	the	slides. To	delete	a	narration,	click	the	Record	Slide	Show	button,	click	Clear,	and	then click	either	Clear	Narrations	on	Current	Slide	 to	delete	narration	from	just	one slide 	or	Clear	Narration	on	All	Slides	 to	delete	all	narration .  Creating	a	video Creating	a	video	from	your	presentation	couldn’t	be	much	easier.	Here’s	the	procedure:  1.	  Optional 	Record	the	slide	timings	and	any	narration	you	want	to	use.   For	the	procedure	to	record	timings	and	narration,	refer	to	the	preceding	section.	If you	skip	this	step,	each	slide	will	be	displayed	for	a	fixed	duration	in	the	resulting video.  2.	 Choose	File ⇒ Export ⇒ Create	a	Video.  The	Create	a	Video	Backstage	View	screen	is	displayed,	as	shown	in	Figure	19-5.  3.	 Select	the	video	quality.  The	first	drop-down	list	on	the	Create	a	Video	page	lets	you	choose	whether	your video	is	targeted	at	computer	displays,	the	Internet,	or	portable	devices.  4.	 Select	whether	to	use	recorded	timings	and	narrations.  If	you	choose	not	to	use	recorded	timings,	you	can	set	the	duration	to	display	each slide.	 The	default	is	5	seconds.   5.	 Click	Create	Video.  A	Save	As	dialog	box	appears.  6.	 Select	the	folder	where	you	want	to	save	the	file	and	enter	the	filename	you  want	to	use. By	default,	the	video	file	will	be	saved	in	the	same	folder	as	the	presentation	and will	have	the	same	name,	but	with	the	extension	.wmv.  7.	 Click	Save.  The	video	is	created.  	Depending	on	the	size	of	the	presentation	and	the	quality	you	selected,	the  video	may	take	a	long	time	to	create.	A	progress	bar	appears	in	the	status	bar	to indicate	the	video’s	progress.	You	can	continue	doing	other	work	in	PowerPoint while	the	video	is	being	created,	but	your	computer	will	probably	respond sluggishly	until	the	video	is	finished.  8.	 When	the	progress	bar	completes,	the	video	is	finished!   Figure	19-5:	Creating	a	video.  You	can	view	the	video	in	Windows	Media	Player	by	navigating	to	it	in	Windows Explorer	and	double-clicking	the	video’s	.wmv	file.   Packaging	Your	Presentation	on	a	CD  Often,	you	may	need	to	share	a	PowerPoint	presentation	with	someone	who	doesn’t own	a	copy	of	PowerPoint.	Fortunately,	PowerPoint	includes	a	Package	for	CD command	that	creates	a	CD	with	the	presentation	and	a	special	program	called	the PowerPoint	Viewer	that	can	display	the	presentation	on	a	computer	that	doesn’t	have PowerPoint	installed.  	Unfortunately,	the	PowerPoint	Viewer	program	that’s	placed	on	the	CD	isn’t able	to	display	all	the	features	of	PowerPoint	2016	presentations	with	the	same quality	that	PowerPoint	2016	displays	them.	As	a	result,	your	presentation	may look	slightly	different	when	you	view	it	with	the	PowerPoint	Viewer.  To	create	a	CD	with	your	presentation,	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Open	the	presentation	in	PowerPoint	and	then	choose	File ⇒ Export ⇒   Package	Presentation	for	CD.	Then	click	the	Package	for	CD	button. The	Package	for	CD	dialog	box	appears,	as	shown	in	Figure	19-6.  2.	 Click	the	Options	button.  This	step	summons	the	Options	dialog	box,	shown	in	Figure	19-7.  3.	 Look	over	the	options	and	change	any	that	aren’t	set	the	way	you	want.  The	following	list	describes	each	of	the	options	that	are	available:  Linked	Files:	Select	this	option	to	include	any	linked	files,	such	as	videos	or large	audio	files. Embedded	TrueType	Fonts:	Select	this	option	to	ensure	that	the	fonts	you use	in	your	presentation	will	be	available	when	you	show	the	presentation	on another	computer. Password	to	Open	Each	Presentation:	Enter	a	password	if	the	presentation contains	top-secret	information,	such	as	the	true	whereabouts	of	Jimmy Hoffa. Password	to	Modify	Each	Presentation:	Enter	a	password	if	you	want	to prevent	unauthorized	people	from	changing	the	presentation. Inspect	Presentations	for	Inappropriate	or	Private	Information:	Sorry,	this option	doesn’t	check	your	presentation	for	off-color	jokes	or	naughty pictures.	Instead,	it	checks	for	any	personal	information	that	might	be embedded	in	your	presentation.  4.	 Click	OK	to	return	to	the	Package	for	CD	dialog	box. 5.	 If	you	want	to	add	other	presentations	to	the	CD,	click	Add	Files,	select	the  files	that	you	want	to	add,	and	then	click	Add.   You	can	put	as	many	files	as	will	fit	on	the	CD.	You	can	add	other	PowerPoint presentations	or	any	other	files	you’d	like	to	add	to	the	CD,	such	as	Word documents	or	text	files.  6.	 Click	Copy	to	CD.  If	you	haven’t	already	inserted	a	blank	CD	into	the	drive,	you’re	prompted	to	insert one	now.	Go	ahead	and	insert	a	blank	CD	when	prompted. PowerPoint	copies	the	files	to	the	CD.	This	might	take	a	few	minutes,	so	now	is	a good	time	to	catch	a	few	z’s.	When	the	CD	is	finished,	the	drive	spits	it	out	and asks	whether	you	want	to	make	another	copy.  7.	 Remove	the	CD	and	then	click	Yes	if	you	want	to	make	another	copy.  Otherwise,	click	No	and	then	click	Close. You’re	done!  Figure	19-6:	The	Package	for	CD	dialog	box.  Figure	19-7:	The	Options	dialog	box.  The	CD	is	set	up	so	that	the	presentation	should	start	running	all	by	itself	when	you insert	it	into	a	computer.	If	it	doesn’t,	open	a	My	Computer	window	and	then	open	the CD	drive	and	double-click	pptview.exe.	A	list	of	presentations	on	the	CD	appears.   Double-click	the	one	that	you	want	to	run,	and	off	you	go.   Creating	Word	Handouts  The	final	Export	topic	for	this	chapter	is	using	the	Create	Handouts	command	to	create a	Word	document	that	you	can	then	print	and	distribute	to	your	audience.	Using	this feature	is	simple;	just	follow	these	steps: 1.	 Choose	File ⇒ Export ⇒ Create	Handouts,	then	click	the	Create	Handouts  button. This	brings	up	the	dialog	box	shown	in	Figure	19-8.  2.	 Choose	the	formatting	option	you	want	to	use.  You	have	several	options	for	the	page	layout: Slides	on	the	left	and	notes	on	the	right Slides	on	the	left	and	blank	lines	on	the	right Slides	at	the	top	of	the	page	and	notes	below	the	slides Slides	at	the	top	of	the	page	and	blank	lines	below	the	slides Just	the	outline  3.	 Click	OK.  You’re	done!  PowerPoint	grinds	and	whirs	for	a	bit,	then	regurgitates	the	presentation	in	the	form of	a	Word	document,	as	shown	in	Figure	19-9. 4.	 Edit	the	document	as	you	see	fit,	then	save	it.  Figure	19-8:	Exporting	a	PowerPoint	presentation	to	Word.   Figure	19-9:	A	PowerPoint	presentation	converted	to	Word.  Note	that	if	you	don’t	plan	on	editing	the	document	in	Word,	there’s	no	real	advantage to	exporting	the	presentation	to	a	Word	document.	Instead,	you	can	simply	print	the slides	and	notes	by	using	PowerPoint’s	Print	command.   Part	V   The	Part	of	Tens  	Find	ten	things	that	often	go	wrong	in	PowerPoint	2016	online	at  www.dummies.com extras powerpoint2016.    In	this	part	…  	Get	familiar	ten	PowerPoint	commandments	—	obey	these	commandments	and	it shall	go	well	with	you,	with	your	computer,	and	even	with	your	projector. 	Find	out	a	few	tips	and	pointers	that	will	help	you	produce	readable	slides. 	Explore	some	things	you	can	do	to	prevent	the	audience	from	falling	asleep	during the	presentation.   Chapter	20   Ten	PowerPoint	Commandments  And	the	hapless	Windows	user	said,	“But	who	am	I	to	make	this	presentation? For	I	am	not	eloquent,	but	I	am	slow	of	speech	and	of	tongue,	and	my	colors clasheth,	and	my	charts	runneth	over.”	And	Microsoft	answered,	“Fear	not,	for unto	you	this	day	is	given	a	program,	which	shall	be	called	PowerPoint,	and	it shall	make	for	you	slides,	which	shall	bring	forth	titles	and	bullets	and,	yea,	even diagrams.”  —Presentations	1:1 And	so	it	came	to	pass	that	these	ten	PowerPoint	commandments	were	passed	down from	generation	to	generation.	Obey	these	commandments	and	it	shall	go	well	with you,	with	your	computer,	and	yea	even	with	your	projector.   I.	Thou	Shalt	Frequently	Savest	Thy	Work  Every	two	or	three	minutes,	press	Ctrl+S.	It	takes	only	a	second	to	save	your	file,	and you	never	know	when	you’ll	be	the	victim	of	a	rotating	power	outage	 even	if	you don’t	live	in	California .   II.	Thou	Shalt	Storeth	Each	Presentation	in Its	Proper	Folder  Whenever	you	save	a	file,	double-check	the	folder	that	you’re	saving	it	to.	It’s	all	too easy	to	save	a	presentation	in	the	wrong	folder	and	then	spend	hours	searching	for	the file	later.	You’ll	wind	up	blaming	the	computer	for	losing	your	files.   III.	Thou	Shalt	Not	Abuseth	Thy	Program’s Formatting	Features  Yes,	PowerPoint	lets	you	set	every	word	in	a	different	font,	use	92	different	colors	on	a single	slide,	and	fill	every	last	pixel	of	empty	space	with	clip	art.	If	you	want	your slides	to	look	like	ransom	notes,	go	ahead.	Otherwise,	keep	things	simple.   IV.	Thou	Shalt	Not	Stealeth	Copyrighted Materials  Given	a	few	minutes	with	Google	or	any	other	search	engine,	you	can	probably	find just	the	right	picture	or	snippet	of	clip	art	for	any	presentation	need	that	might	arise. But	keep	in	mind	that	many	of	those	pictures,	clip	art	drawings,	and	media	files	are copyrighted.	Don’t	use	them	if	you	don’t	have	permission.   V.	Thou	Shalt	Abideth	by	Thine	Color Scheme,	Auto-Layout,	and	Template  Microsoft	hired	a	crew	of	out-of-work	artists	to	pick	the	colors	for	the	color	schemes, arrange	things	with	the	slide	layouts,	and	create	beautifully	crafted	templates.	Humor them.	They	like	it	when	you	use	their	stuff.	Don’t	feel	chained	to	the	prepackaged designs,	but	don’t	stray	far	from	them	unless	you	have	a	good	artistic	eye.   VI.	Thou	Shalt	Not	Abuse	Thine	Audience with	an	Endless	Array	of	Cute	Animations or	Funny	Sounds  PowerPoint	animations	are	cute	and	sometimes	quite	useful.	But	if	you	do	a	goofy animation	on	every	slide,	pretty	soon	your	audience	will	just	think	you’re	strange.   VII.	Keep	Thy	Computer	Gurus	Happy  If	you	have	a	friend	or	co-worker	who	knows	more	about	computers	than	you	do,	keep that	person	happy.	Throw	him	or	her	an	occasional	Twinkie	or	a	bag	of	Cheetos.	Treat computer	nerds	as	if	they’re	human	beings.	After	all,	you	want	them	to	be	your	friends.   VIII.	Thou	Shalt	Backeth	Up	Thy	Files	Day by	Day  Yes,	every	day.	One	of	these	days,	you’ll	come	to	work	only	to	discover	a	pile	of	rubble where	your	desk	used	to	be.	A	federal	agent	will	pick	up	what’s	left	of	your	computer’s keyboard	and	laugh.	But	if	you	back	up	every	day,	you	won’t	lose	more	than	a	day’s work. Note	that	if	you	save	your	files	on	OneDrive,	Microsoft	will	take	care	of	backing	them up	for	you.	That’s	one	of	the	main	benefits	of	using	cloud	storage	for	your	important documents.   IX.	Thou	Shalt	Fear	No	Evil,	for	Ctrl+Z	Is Always	with	Thee  March	ahead	with	boldness.	Not	sure	what	a	button	does?	Click	it!	Click	it	twice	if	it makes	you	feel	powerful!	The	worst	that	it	can	do	is	mess	up	your	presentation.	If	that happens,	you	can	press	Ctrl+Z	to	set	things	back	the	way	they	should	be.  	If	you	really	mess	things	up,	just	close	the	presentation	without	saving.	Then  open	the	previously	saved	version.	After	all,	you	did	obey	the	first	commandment, didn’t	you?   X.	Thou	Shalt	Not	Panic  You’re	the	only	one	who	knows	you’re	nervous.	You’ll	do	just	fine.	Imagine	the audience	naked	if	that	will	help.	 Unless,	of	course,	you’re	making	a	presentation	to	a nudist	club	and	they	actually	are	naked,	in	which	case	try	to	imagine	them	with	their clothes	on.    Chapter	21   Ten	Tips	for	Creating	Readable	Slides  This	chapter	gives	you	a	few	random	tips	and	pointers	that	will	help	you	produce readable	slides.   Try	Reading	the	Slide	from	the	Back	of	the Room  The	number-one	rule	of	creating	readable	slides	is	that	everyone	in	the	room	must	be able	to	read	them.	If	you’re	not	certain,	there’s	one	sure	way	to	find	out:	Try	it.	Fire	up the	projector,	call	up	the	slide,	walk	to	the	back	of	the	room,	and	see	whether	you	can read	it.	If	you	can’t,	you	need	to	make	an	adjustment.  	Remember	that	everyone’s	eyesight	might	not	be	as	good	as	yours.	If	you	have perfect	vision,	squint	a	little	when	you	get	to	the	back	of	the	room	to	see	how	the slide	might	appear	to	someone	whose	vision	isn’t	perfect.  If	a	projector	isn’t	handy,	make	sure	you	can	read	your	slides	from	10	or	15	feet	away from	your	computer’s	monitor.   Avoid	Small	Text  If	you	can’t	read	a	slide	from	the	back	of	the	room,	it’s	probably	because	the	text	is	too small.	The	rule	to	live	by	is	that	24-point	type	is	the	smallest	you	should	use	for	text that	you	want	people	to	read.	A	12-point	type	might	be	perfectly	readable	in	a	Word document,	but	it’s	way	too	small	for	PowerPoint.   No	More	Than	Five	Bullets,	Please  Did	you	ever	notice	how	David	Letterman	used	two	slides	to	display	his	Top	Ten	lists? Dave’s	producers	knew	that	ten	items	is	way	too	many	for	one	screen.	Five	is	just	right. You	might	be	able	to	slip	in	six	now	and	again,	but	if	you’re	up	to	seven	or	eight,	try breaking	the	slide	into	two	slides.   Avoid	Excessive	Verbiage	Lending	to Excessively	Lengthy	Text	That	Is	Not	Only Redundant	But	Also	Repetitive	and Reiterative  See	what	I	mean?	Maybe	the	heading	should	have	been	“Be	Brief.”   Use	Consistent	Wording  One	sign	of	an	amateur	presentation	is	wording	in	bullet	lists	that	isn’t	grammatically consistent.	Consider	this	list:  Profits	will	be	improved Expanding	markets It	will	reduce	the	amount	of	overseas	competition Production	increase  Each	list	item	uses	a	different	grammatical	construction.	The	same	points	made	with consistent	wording	have	a	more	natural	flow	and	make	a	more	compelling	case:  While	you’re	at	it,	use	active	voice	rather	than	passive	voice	whenever	possible.	An even	stronger	form	of	the	bulleted	list	would	be	this:  Improved	profits Expanded	markets Reduced	overseas	competition Increased	production  Improve	profits. Expand	markets. Reduce	overseas	competition. Increase	production.   Avoid	Unsightly	Color	Combinations  The	professionally	chosen	color	schemes	that	come	with	PowerPoint	are	designed	to create	slides	that	are	easy	to	read.	If	you	venture	away	from	them,	be	careful	about choosing	colors	that	are	hard	to	read. While	you’re	at	it,	consider	that	some	people	have	various	forms	of	color	insensitivity. The	most	common	form	makes	it	difficult	to	distinguish	midrange	shades	of	red	from midrange	shades	of	green,	so	you	may	want	to	avoid	using	such	combinations	when	the distinction	is	important	to	your	presentation.   Watch	the	Line	Endings  Sometimes,	PowerPoint	breaks	a	line	at	an	awkward	spot,	which	can	make	slides	hard to	read.	For	example,	a	bullet	point	might	be	one	word	too	long	to	fit	on	a	single	line. When	that	happens,	you	might	want	to	break	the	line	elsewhere	so	the	second	line	has more	than	one	word.	 Press	Shift+Enter	to	create	a	line	break	that	doesn’t	start	a	new paragraph.  Alternatively,	you	might	want	to	drag	the	right	margin	of	the	text	placeholder	to increase	the	margin	width	so	that	the	line	doesn’t	have	to	be	broken	at	all.  	Web	addresses	 URLs 	are	notoriously	hard	to	squeeze	onto	a	single	line.	If  your	presentation	includes	long	URLs,	pay	special	attention	to	how	they	fit.	And consider	using	URL	shortening	services	such	as	Bitly	 www.bitly.com 	or TinyURL	 www.tinyurl.com .   Keep	the	Background	Simple  Don’t	splash	a	bunch	of	distracting	clip	art	on	the	background	unless	it’s	essential.	The purpose	of	the	background	is	to	provide	a	well-defined	visual	space	for	the	slide’s content.	All	too	often,	presenters	put	up	slides	that	have	text	displayed	on	top	of pictures	of	the	mountains	or	city	skylines,	which	makes	the	text	almost	impossible	to read.   Use	Only	Two	Levels	of	Bullets  Sure,	it’s	tempting	to	develop	your	subpoints	into	sub-subpoints	and	sub-sub-subpoints, but	no	one	will	be	able	to	follow	your	logic.	Don’t	make	your	slides	more	confusing than	they	need	to	be.	If	you	need	to	make	sub-sub-subpoints,	you	probably	need	a	few more	slides.   Avoid	Bullets	Altogether	If	You	Can  Bullets	have	become	cliché.	If	possible,	eliminate	them	altogether	from	your presentation.	A	single,	well-chosen	photograph	is	often	a	far	better	way	to communicate	a	key	point	than	a	list	of	bullet	points.   Keep	Charts	and	Diagrams	Simple  PowerPoint	can	create	elaborate	graphs	that	even	the	best	statisticians	will	marvel	at. However,	the	most	effective	graphs	are	simple	pie	charts	with	three	or	four	slices	and simple	column	charts	with	three	or	four	columns.	Likewise,	pyramid,	Venn,	and	other types	of	diagrams	lose	their	impact	when	you	add	more	than	four	or	five	elements.  	If	you	remember	only	one	rule	when	creating	your	presentations,	remember  this	one:	Keep	it	simple,	clean,	and	concise.   Chapter	22   Ten	Ways	to	Keep	Your	Audience	Awake  Nothing	frightens	a	public	speaker	more	than	the	prospect	of	the	audience	falling asleep	during	the	speech.	Here	are	some	things	you	can	do	to	prevent	that	from happening.	 Yawn.    Don’t	Forget	Your	Purpose  Too	many	presenters	ramble	on	and	on	with	no	clear	sense	of	purpose.	The	temptation is	to	throw	in	every	clever	quotation	and	every	interesting	tidbit	you	can	muster	that	is even	remotely	related	to	the	topic	of	your	presentation.	The	reason	that	this	temptation is	so	strong	is	that	you	most	likely	haven’t	identified	what	you	hope	to	accomplish	with your	presentation.	In	other	words,	you	haven’t	pinned	down	your	purpose. Don’t	confuse	a	presentation’s	title	with	its	purpose.	Suppose	that	you’re	asked	to	give a	presentation	to	a	prospective	client	on	the	advantages	of	your	company’s	new, improved,	deluxe	model	ChronSimplastic	Infindibulator.	Your	purpose	in	this presentation	is	not	to	convey	information	about	the	new	Infindibulator,	but	to	persuade your	client	to	buy	one	of	the	$65	million	beasties.	The	title	of	your	presentation	might be	Infindibulators	for	the	21st	Century,	but	the	purpose	is	“Convince	these	saps	to	buy one,	or	maybe	two.”   Don’t	Become	a	Slave	to	Your	Slides  PowerPoint	makes	such	beautiful	slides	that	the	temptation	is	to	let	them	be	the	show. That’s	a	big	mistake.	You	are	the	show	—	not	the	slides.	The	slides	are	merely	visual aids,	designed	to	make	your	presentation	more	effective,	not	to	steal	the	show. Your	slides	should	supplement	your	talk,	not	repeat	it.	If	you	find	yourself	just	reading your	slides,	you	need	to	rethink	what	you	put	on	the	slides.	The	slides	should summarize	key	points,	not	become	the	script	for	your	speech.   Don’t	Overwhelm	Your	Audience	with Unnecessary	Detail  On	November	19,	1863,	a	crowd	of	15,000	gathered	in	Gettysburg	to	hear	Edward Everett,	one	of	the	greatest	orators	of	the	time.	Mr.	Everett	spoke	for	two	hours	about the	events	that	had	transpired	during	the	famous	battle.	When	he	finished,	Abraham Lincoln	rose	to	deliver	a	brief	two-minute	postscript	that	has	become	the	most	famous speech	in	American	history. If	PowerPoint	had	been	around	in	1863,	Everett	probably	would	have	spoken	for	four hours.	PowerPoint	practically	begs	you	to	talk	too	much.	When	you	start	typing	bullets, you	can’t	stop.	Pretty	soon,	you	have	40	slides	for	a	20-minute	presentation.	That’s about	35	more	than	you	probably	need.	Try	to	shoot	for	one	slide	for	every	two	to	five minutes	of	your	presentation.   Don’t	Neglect	Your	Opening  As	they	say,	you	get	only	one	opportunity	to	make	a	first	impression.	Don’t	waste	it	by telling	a	joke	that	has	nothing	to	do	with	the	topic,	apologizing	for	your	lack	of preparation	or	nervousness,	or	listing	your	credentials.	Don’t	pussyfoot	around;	get right	to	the	point. The	best	openings	are	those	that	capture	the	audience’s	attention	with	a	provocative statement,	a	rhetorical	question,	or	a	compelling	story.	A	joke	is	okay,	but	only	if	it	sets the	stage	for	the	subject	of	your	presentation.   Be	Relevant  The	objective	of	any	presentation	is	to	lead	your	audience	to	say,	“Me,	too!” Unfortunately,	many	presentations	leave	the	audience	thinking,	“So	what?” The	key	to	being	relevant	is	giving	your	audience	members	what	they	need,	and	not what	you	think	is	interesting	or	important.	The	most	persuasive	presentations	are	those that	present	solutions	to	real	problems	rather	than	opinions	about	hypothetical problems.   Don’t	Forget	the	Altar	Call  What	would	a	Billy	Graham	crusade	be	without	the	altar	call?	A	wasted	opportunity. The	best	presentations	are	the	ones	that	call	your	audience	to	action.	That	might	mean buying	your	product,	changing	their	lifestyles,	or	just	being	interested	enough	to	do more	research	into	your	topic. But	the	opportunity	will	be	wasted	if	you	don’t	invite	your	audience	to	respond	in	some way.	If	you’re	selling	something	 and	we’re	all	selling	something! ,	make	it	clear	how your	audience	can	buy.	Tell	them	the	toll-free	number.	Give	them	a	handout	with	links of	websites	they	can	go	to	for	more	information.	Ask	everyone	to	sing	“Just	As	I	Am.” Do	whatever	it	takes.   Practice,	Practice,	Practice  Back	to	good	ol’	Abe:	Somehow	a	rumor	got	started	that	Abraham	Lincoln	hastily wrote	the	Gettysburg	Address	on	the	train,	just	before	pulling	into	Gettysburg.	In	truth, Lincoln	agonized	for	weeks	over	every	word. Practice,	practice,	practice.	Work	through	the	rough	spots.	Polish	the	opening	and	the closing	and	all	the	awkward	transitions	in	between.	Practice	in	front	of	a	mirror. Videotape	yourself.	Time	yourself.   Relax!  Don’t	worry!	Be	happy!	Even	the	most	gifted	public	speakers	are	scared	silly	every time	they	step	up	to	the	podium.	Whether	you’re	speaking	to	one	person	or	10,000, relax.	In	20	minutes,	it	will	all	be	over. No	matter	how	nervous	you	are,	no	one	knows	it	except	you.	That	is,	unless	you	tell them.	The	number-one	rule	of	panic	avoidance	is	to	never	apologize	for	your	fears. Behind	the	podium,	your	knees	might	be	knocking	hard	enough	to	bruise	yourself,	but no	one	else	will	notice.	After	you	swab	down	your	armpits	and	wipe	the	drool	off	your chin,	people	will	say,	“Weren’t	you	nervous?	You	seemed	so	relaxed!”   Expect	the	Unexpected  Plan	on	things	going	wrong,	because	they	will.	The	projector	may	not	focus,	the microphone	may	go	dead,	you	may	drop	your	notes	on	the	way	to	the	podium.	Who knows	what	else	may	happen? Take	things	in	stride,	but	be	prepared	for	problems	you	can	anticipate.	Carry	an	extra set	of	notes	in	your	pocket.	Bring	your	own	microphone	if	you	have	one.	Have	a backup	projector	ready	if	possible.	Bring	two	copies	of	your	presentation	on	flash drives,	and	don’t	put	them	both	in	your	briefcase.   Don’t	Be	Boring  An	audience	can	overlook	almost	anything,	but	one	thing	they’ll	never	forgive	you	for is	boring	them.	Above	all,	do	not	bore	your	audience. This	guideline	doesn’t	mean	you	have	to	tell	jokes,	jump	up	and	down,	or	talk	fast. Jokes,	excessive	jumping,	and	rapid	speech	can	be	unimaginably	boring.	If	you	obey the	other	instructions	in	this	chapter	—	if	you	have	a	clear-cut	purpose	and	stick	to	it, avoid	unnecessary	detail,	and	address	real	needs	—	you’ll	never	be	boring.	Just	be yourself	and	have	fun.	If	you	have	fun,	so	will	your	audience.    About	the	Author Doug	Lowe	has	written	enough	computer	books	to	line	all	the	birdcages	in	California.
