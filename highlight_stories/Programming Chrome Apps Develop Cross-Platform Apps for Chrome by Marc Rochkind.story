Still here? There’s some more important stuff to know, so please continue. Chapter 1 explains in detail what a Chrome App is, but briefly, its relationship to Chrome is the same as a Windows app to Windows, or a Mac app to OS X: an app that you install on the platform and that makes use of application program interfaces  APIs  unique to that platform. This would be obvious but for the fact that the platform in this case, Chrome, is better known as a web browser and most of the “apps” that you run on it are really just fancy web pages. I’m thinking of Gmail, Facebook, Amazon, and a zillion others. Hence the confusion. Why consider programming a Chrome App at all? Here are two good reasons:    They’re portable across all of the major operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Chrome OS  for Chromebooks and Chromeboxes , and, with some restric‐ tions, even Android and iOS.    Although web apps are equally as portable, they can’t access the local computer as Chrome Apps can. The most important example of this is that Chrome Apps can access the computer’s filesystem, just as native apps can.  I’m unable to think of any other platform that offers these two advantages. With the good comes the not-so-good. Here are the chief disadvantages of Chrome Apps:    On desktop operating systems, they run only under Chrome  although they can  have their own launch icon and they appear to run standalone .  www.it-ebooks.info  ix     Although the Chrome API is extensive and growing, it isn’t even close to encapsu‐  lating every native API.  A disclaimer: I’m not with Google, never have been, don’t even know anyone who works on Chrome at Google, and Google didn’t authorize this book. So, even though you won’t get any inside info in this book, you will get an entirely objective viewpoint. If I think something is screwed up, I’ll let you know. What You Should Already Know In the world of web-programming books, this one’s fairly advanced, as I assume you already know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and your way around the Document Object Model  DOM , which is a JavaScript object that represents the HTML elements of a web page. That said, my use of those technologies is fairly basic, so if you’re rusty or don’t mind jumping off a metaphorical cliff, you can read up on what I’m assuming you know as you encounter it. Some popular technologies sometimes used to write Chrome Apps, such as jQuery and the AngularJS framework, aren’t covered in this book, because they aren’t specific to Chrome Apps and because they would obscure the example code. That code might be clearer to those who know these tools, but it would greatly inconvenience everyone else. Rather,  I’ve  tried  to  write  the  examples  in  the  simplest  possible  way,  using  plain, unadulterated JavaScript. Another point is that cross-browser portability, an important benefit of these technologies ordinarily, is irrelevant when you’re writing a Chrome App. Why I Wrote This Book I first wrote a Chrome App—then called a “Packaged App”—a few years ago when they were first released by Google. At that time, they were an offshoot of Chrome Extensions, and the documentation had the terminology for Apps and Extensions throughly con‐ fused. I got my app running, but it was obvious that apps for Chrome had a long way to go. By late 2013, things had been cleaned up a lot. They were now called Chrome Apps, there were a lot more APIs, and the documentation was better, though still not well edited. Meanwhile, Samsung had introduced a $250 Chromebook. I bought one and realized that for most of what I did when I wasn’t downstairs in my office, it was just as good as my MacBook Air. I wasn’t the only one to feel this way: today, Chromebooks are at or near the top of Amazon’s laptop best-seller list. So, here’s the book I wish I’d had when I started with Chrome Apps. Now that it’s in your hands, you can start way ahead of where I was.  x     Preface  www.it-ebooks.info   Navigating This Book At this point most prefaces describe what’s in each chapter, but I’ve always thought that was silly because the same information is in the Table of Contents. I will say this much: read all of Chapter 1 carefully, even if you’re in the habit of skipping the first chapter of any programming book, because that’s where I explain how Chrome Apps are different from other things you run in a browser and, most important, their limitations relative to ordinary web pages. After that, I’ve written the rest to be read sequentially because later chapters build on earlier ones, but you can certainly skip around if you want. There’s lots of code in this book, but I usually explain it in small bites so that you can more easily digest it. That might make it hard for you to see what’s going on in the app as a whole, so, as I go through an app, keep its code open in a text editor as a reference. See the section “Using Code Examples” on page xii a bit later in this Preface for infor‐ mation on how to get the code. Online Resources I’ll refer to URLs for documentation throughout this book, but the most important one is Google’s official Chrome App site at developer.chrome.com apps. You’ll want to look around that site right away, and you’ll likely keep going back to it as you read this book.

He seemed to be publishing on all the hot Unix topics of the day. I went on to write three more books but never managed to do one with Tim’s company. After decades of wishing I had an animal of my own, it’s finally hap‐ pened: I’m a crested screamer! Thanks, Tim, for all you’ve done for programmers over the years. I’d also like to thank my editor, Brian MacDonald, for all of his astute comments; Heather Scherer, the project manager; and the technical reviewers, who helped greatly in im‐ proving the book. Thanks, too, go to Bob Russell, a terrific copyeditor, whose sugges‐ tions make the book seem like it was written by a better writer than me.  Preface      xiii  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 1 Your First Chrome App  In this chapter, I’ll take you step by step through building your first, simple Chrome App. I’ll explain the key differences between a Chrome App and an ordinary web app of the sort with which you may already be familiar. I’ll tell you how to run your app, how to use the new Chrome Dev Editor, and how to publish it to the Chrome Web Store. From Web Apps to Chrome Apps To build this first Chrome App, let’s begin with something you already know how to build: a simple web app that converts meters to feet, as shown in Figure 1-1. To use the app, you enter an amount of meters in the first field and then click the Convert button. The app then displays the equivalent amount in feet in the second field.  Figure 1-1. Converter web app running in Chrome  Like all web apps, the user interface for our sample app is built from an HTML file,  index.html , which you can see in the following:  www.it-ebooks.info  1                    Converter                            Meters:                            Feet:                            Convert             The   tag brings in the following JavaScript, which is in the file converter.js:  window.onload = function    {     document.querySelector "convert" .addEventListener "click",         function    {             var meters = document.querySelector "meters" ;             var feet = document.querySelector "feet" ;             feet.value = meters.value * 3.28084;         }      ; };  The code executes in the window.onload event handler to ensure that all of the HTML elements are loaded before they’re referenced. Another event handler is set up to do the actual work when you click the Convert button. Both handlers are passed anonymous functions that execute when the corresponding event fires.  onload versus DOMContentLoaded  An alternative to the onload event is DOMContentLoaded, which is a little better for web pages because it fires as soon as the DOM is loaded without waiting for things such as images and styles. But, because all Chrome App resources must be local, the performance difference is inconsequential, and I prefer onload because I want to know that the entire interface is complete before I execute any JavaScript.  Use any text editor you like for these two files and all other source files you’ll need. It’s convenient  to  use  an  editor  that  can  group  files  in  a  folder  together,  but  that’s  not essential.  2      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   Two more small files turn this web app into a Chrome App. The first, manifest.json, identifies the web app as a Chrome App. The manifest is coded in JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  to define values for at least four required properties, like this:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "Converter",     "version": "1.0.0" }  Here are the properties: app.background  The name of the background script. This property is what identifies this app as a Chrome App, not something else such as an Extension.  manifest_version  This is always 2, indicating that the app will use the second and newest version of the Chrome application programming interface  API .  The name of the app.  name  version  The version of the app, set to anything you like, as long as it’s one to four dot- separated integers.  Unlike the more relaxed rules for JavaScript, JSON requires that you enclose all keys in double-quotes.  The script file referenced from the manifest, background.js, is where execution begins. In contrast, processing for a web app begins with the HTML file. In practice, the Java‐ Script in a background script only sets up application-wide event handlers, leaving the bulk of the processing to the JavaScript referenced from the HTML file  converter.js, in this case . The most important application-wide event is the chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched event, fired when the application launches. When that happens, an application usually wants to create a window in which to run the HTML file, like this, in background.js:  From Web Apps to Chrome Apps      3  www.it-ebooks.info   chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function    {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html' ;     }  ;  There are a few other events that you might set up handlers for in your background script,  such  as  chrome.runtime.onInstalled  and  chrome.runtime.onSuspend;  I’ll discuss those when we actually need them. Keep in mind that, unlike other JavaScript files in your app, the background script can be unloaded by Chrome when it’s inactive and then reloaded  executed from the top  when it becomes active again. As a result, it’s important to do nothing there other than to add event listeners. Technically, the background script runs an event page, which can be unloaded, not a background page, which stays loaded. Chrome Apps can never have background pages, even though the background property is what appears in the manifest and the file is usually named background.js. Chrome Apps don’t need any kind of linker or packaging utility. You just put these four files  index.html, converter.js, manifest.json, and background.js  in a folder called, for example, converter, and you have a Chrome App. If you’d like, you can use CSS for styling, and you can put it in any of the usual places: in the HTML file or in separate CSS files. Just remember that they need to be present in the app folder; you cannot download them from a website. You can also have several JavaScript files if you want, each referenced from a    tag in the HTML file. Again, make sure that all resources are local—inside the app folder. Running a Chrome App Here’s what you do to run your Chrome App:  1. In Chrome, open the Extensions page, in either of two ways: you can access it by using the Window menu or the Chrome customization menu  the icon at the upper right of the Chrome window  or, in the address bar, you can type chrome:  exten sions.   “Extensions”  is  somewhat  of  a  misnomer,  because  the  page  is  used  for Chrome Apps as well as Extensions.   2. Ensure that the “Developer mode” checkbox is checked. 3. Click the “Load unpacked extension” button and then select the Chrome App’s  folder.  4. After the app installs, click the Launch link, as shown in Figure 1-2.  4      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-2. Converter Chrome App installed in Chrome  When the app launches, the chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched event is fired, its handler executes, a window is created, and you’ll see the app running in its own window, as depicted in Figure 1-3.  Figure 1-3. Converter Chrome App running  An app running in its own window is nifty, but there’s a lot more to Chrome Apps besides that. Unlike web apps downloaded from a server, Chrome Apps have access to special APIs that can access files anywhere on the computer, carry out automatic file synchro‐ nization, access hardware  for example, audio, USB, and Bluetooth , and much more. That’s what this book is about!  Running a Chrome App      5  www.it-ebooks.info   In addition to running on the desktop platforms that support Chrome  Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS , Chrome Apps can use a technology called Cordova to run natively on the Android and iOS mobile platforms. I’ll explain how Cordova works in Appendix D.  There are Chrome browsers for Android and iOS, but as of now, Chrome Apps don’t run on them.  Using the Chrome Dev Editor As I was finishing up this book, Google released a developer preview of an integrated development enviroment  IDE  for Chrome called the Chrome Dev Editor. In addition to handling Chrome Apps written in JavaScript  what this book covers , you can also use the Dart language  a Google successor to JavaScript  and develop web apps in either language  along with HTML and CSS, of course . Although the text editor built in to the Chrome Dev Editor is pretty minimal compared to what you’re probably using, it does make testing easier by avoiding the need to load unpacked extensions from the Extensions page, it makes uploading to the Chrome Web Store easier  no need to zip anything , and it makes testing Cordova apps much easier  see Appendix D . To begin using the Chrome Dev Editor, download and install it from the Chrome Web Store as you would any Chrome App. Next, launch it and then, from the menu, choose New Project. A dialog box opens from which you can choose the type of app you want to create. Choose JavaScript Chrome App  see Figure 1-4  and click Create. The app’s files are then created automatically, three of which are shown in Figure 1-5, Figure 1-6, and Figure 1-7. Next, click the Run button  shown circled in Figure 1-7 . Figure 1-8 shows the results. To develop your app, you edit and modify the created files as you want, although you might prefer to switch to your favorite text editor for that. I use the Chrome Dev Editor only for building the initial app and for testing; I don’t like using the IDE’s built-in editor for anything much more complex than that.  6      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-4.

Running the app created with the Chrome Dev Editor Differences Among Chrome Apps, Chrome Extensions, and Hosted Apps There are two other kinds of executables that run on Chrome but aren’t the same as Chrome Apps and aren’t covered by this book: Chrome Extensions  These modify or extend the operation of the Chrome browser. Extensions also have access to special APIs, but they’re generally different from Chrome App APIs.  Hosted Apps  These are just web-page URLs packaged up so that they can be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store. There are no special APIs for them.  The manifest.json file determines what kind of executable you have. As we’ve seen, Chrome  Apps  always  have  an  app.background.scripts  property  in  their  mani‐ fest.json file, like this:  ... "app": {  Differences Among Chrome Apps, Chrome Extensions, and Hosted Apps      9  www.it-ebooks.info   Chrome Extensions have a background.scripts property  background at the top level , as in the following:      "background": {         "scripts": [ "background.js" ]     } } ....  ... "background": {     "scripts": [ "eventpage.js" ],     "persistent": false } ....   If the persistent property is omitted or true, the Extension has a background page instead of an event page; this distinction is absent from Chrome Apps, which always have event pages.  Hosted Apps have an app.launch property, like this:  "app": {     "launch": {         "web_url": "http:  basepath.com "     } }  In the interest of being thorough with my description: Chrome Apps used to be called “Packaged Apps,” a term still erroneously used by some people. Packaged Apps worked differently and had a different manifest.json format, and they’re no longer supported by Chrome. Their manifest had an app.launch.local_path property:  "app": {     "launch": {         "local_path": "main.html"     } }  If you have old code with a manifest like this, you need to convert it to a Chrome App with the manifest_version property set to 2. Again, in the interest of being thorough: there are also web apps with no manifest.json file at all that aren’t installed into Chrome; they run when their URL is requested by a browser. These are just web pages that might run some JavaScript to give them an app-like user inter‐ face. There are zillions of these: Gmail, Amazon, Facebook, and so on. The web app that started this chapter is one of these, too.  10      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   Chrome App Restrictions In return for running in its own window and getting access to the Chrome APIs, Chrome Apps have to live with some restrictions, mostly for security. After all, if an app is able to access hardware devices and any of the user’s files, it had better play by some very strict rules, officially called the Content Security Policy  CSP . Let’s take a look at these rules:    There can be no JavaScript in any HTML files—not in a   element, and not  as an attribute, like this:   Go   Instead, you put any JavaScript in its own file  or files  and attach event listeners with JavaScript, as we saw in the Converter example.   No navigation can appear in the HTML file, such as:   Next Page   or:     You can still use forms, but all processing must be done in JavaScript via an event listener attached to a submit button. Instead of using multiple HTML pages to show various parts of the user interface, you must modify the document object model  DOM   in  JavaScript.  This  is  why  apps  such  as  Chrome  Apps  are  sometimes called single-page apps.    No on-the-fly compiling of strings to JavaScript with  eval,  setTimeout,  setIn terval, or new Function is allowed. In practice, even if you don’t do these things, libraries you might want to use do, which makes finding libraries that work with Chrome Apps challenging.  setTimeout and setInterval with function callbacks are allowed.  This restriction prevents Cross-Site Scripting  XSS  attacks, in which JavaScript is injected into HTML.    Access to external resources is restricted. For example, it’s illegal to do this:     To access an external image, you must retrieve it as a blob from JavaScript, construct a blob URL, and show that in an image element.  You can see an example in Chap‐ ter 3.  If the image is inside the app folder, you are allowed to reference it locally, so you can treat any static images shipped with your app normally:     Chrome App Restrictions      11  www.it-ebooks.info     None of the built-in dialogs, such as alert or confirm, can be used. Instead, you can pop up your own modal dialog, as I’ll show in Appendix A. If you just want to display something for debugging, you can use console.log to write to the console.   You cannot use cookies. Because cookies are local data sent to the server with HTTP requests, they’re meaningless in Chrome Apps. Instead, there are several other ways to keep local data  see Chapter 3 .    You cannot use embedded processing plug-ins, such as Flash, Silverlight, or Ac‐  tiveX.    You cannot use a Web SQL database, which is nonstandard but is implemented in Chrome for non–Chrome-App pages. For Chrome Apps, there’s a non-SQL In‐ dexedDB API  Chapter 3 .  Even though these restrictions might seem to be burdensome, they’re mostly not a problem if you stop thinking of Chrome Apps as web apps and think of them instead as local, installed apps that can access the web. This is exactly the same mindset that Mac, Windows, and Linux programmers have had for years. Although there’s no way to test the theory, it’s probably true that it’s easier for someone who never heard of the web to learn to program Chrome Apps than it is for anyone familiar with developing for the web. But it’s likely that if you’re reading this book, you’re in the latter group. So, programming Chrome Apps will be confusing at first, and you’ll keep bumping into the restrictions  with mysterious error messages on the console , but after a while you’ll catch on. More on the Manifest The manifest.json file for the Converter app used just the four required properties, but there are lots more properties, only a few of which you’re likely to use unless you’re doing something pretty exotic. Many of them aren’t even documented. There are three recommended properties  according to Google : default_locale  A subdirectory of the locales directory  in the app folder  that contains the default strings. There’s more on this in Chapter 6, in “Internationalization and Localiza‐ tion” on page 207.  description  A plain text string  no HTML  that describes the app. In a homage to mainframe line printers of 50 years ago, the length is limited to 132 characters.  OK, I’m kidding about the homage, but not the strange limit.   12      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   icons  One or more icons; you need only one for running on Chrome  as opposed to Cordova for mobile platforms .  There’s no need for an icon during development, but you’ll want one when you publish your app. Your icon should be 128 × 128 pixels; it will be resized as necessary by Chrome. Several image formats are supported, but PNG icons work best because they support transparency. You can draw an icon using almost any graphics program. If you don’t have one, you can download Gliffy Diagrams, a free Chrome App available from the Chrome Web Store. Suppose that you have an icon file named icon-128.png. You would need to code the icon property in the manifest like this:  "icons": {     "128": "icon-128.png" }  Note that "128" is a string, like all JSON keys, not a number. Although any 128 × 128 icon will work according to the Chrome API documentation, for the Chrome Web Store there are additional recommendations  e.g., margins  which you can read about in “Supplying Images” on the Chrome developer site. The most important optional property is permissions, which I discuss in the next sec‐ tion. I’ll explain any others you might want to use in conjunction with the API calls that they affect. Permissions Most of the Chrome APIs that are available only to Chrome Apps require a specific permission to be listed in the permissions property in the manifest. This is so the user can be prompted to agree to the permission when the app is installed from the Chrome Web  Store.  For  example,  Figure  1-9  shows  what  I  saw  when  I  tried  to  install UberConference:  Permissions      13  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-9. A permission-request dialog box  The dialog box included “Access data you copy and paste” because UberConference listed  the  clipboardRead  and  clipboardWrite  permissions,  and  “Use  your  micro‐ phone” came from the audio permission, which was requested in the manifest, some‐ thing like this:  "permissions": [     "clipboardRead",     "clipboardWrite",     "audio" ]  You can read through the list of permissions on the Chrome developer site. I’ll introduce specific permissions as we proceed, along with the APIs that need them. Debugging Chrome Apps Suppose that you have a bug, such as in the following example where feet is misspelled on the last line of the click event handler  "use strict" makes that a detectable error :  "use strict"; window.onload = function    {     document.querySelector "convert" .addEventListener "click",         function    {             var meters = document.querySelector "meters" ;             var feet = document.querySelector "feet" ;             feat.value = meters.value * 3.28084;         }      ; };  When you click the button, the Developer Tools debugger shows you exactly where and what the problem is. Figure 1-10 shows that in this case, it’s a ReferenceError, which you can see in the panel on the right.  14      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-10. The Developer Tools debugger gives the location of a bug  You can also set breakpoints by clicking on the line number in the margin, as shown in Figure 1-11. Then, when you click the button, execution pauses, as shown in Figure 1-12. As with most debuggers, you can use the Developer Tools debugger to single-step, go into and out of functions, inspect variables, and so forth. You can read more and even watch some videos at developer.chrome.com devtools. An even more useful Developer Tools tab is the Console. Here, you can see error mes‐ sages generated by Chrome and your own debugging output that you write with the console API. For more documentation on this, go to the Console API Reference. The call I use the most is console.log to write messages to the log, as demonstrated in Figure 1-13, which I got by adding one line:  var meters = document.querySelector "meters" ; console.log meters ; var feet = document.querySelector "feet" ; feet.value = meters.value * 3.28084;  Debugging Chrome Apps      15  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 1-11.

Debugging Chrome Apps      17  www.it-ebooks.info   Chrome Release Channels As you might already know, there are four release channels for Chrome. These provide differing degrees of testing and update frequency. As releases mature, they make their way through the channels, which are described here: Stable  Most tested, and intended to be used by most nondevelopers. These releases are updated about every six weeks, with minor updates more often.  A release due to become stable as soon as it’s fully tested, subjected to field testing as a beta, and had some remaining bugs fixed. That takes about a month. Major updates occur about every six weeks, with minor updates oftener.  More buggy than beta. These are updated once or twice a week, with no lag for major versions.  Beta  Dev  Canary  Updated daily. You get the latest code, whether it works or not.  For any installation of Chrome, you need to choose among Stable, Beta, and Dev.  I usually run Beta.  However, you can install Canary alongside one of the others, to be run only when you need it. You should definitely do that if you want to try out new APIs or see if bugs you discover have been fixed. As of this writing, a few APIs that I’ll cover haven’t made it beyond the Dev channel, but they’ll surely be at least in Beta in a few months. Publishing a Chrome App When you’re ready to distribute your Chrome App, you can self-publish it by posting it on your website or publish it to the Chrome Web Store.  Self-Publishing To self-publish your Chrome App, you first need to pack it into a form of ZIP file called a CRX file  filename ending with .crx , which you do by clicking the “Pack extension” button on the Chrome Extensions page  make sure “Developer mode” is checked . Then, you copy that CRX file to your website and put a link to it somewhere so that your users can download it. There’s no “Load packed extension” button to go with “Load unpacked extension,” which you use during development. Instead, the user must find the downloaded CRX file by using the Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, Chrome OS Files app, or whatever Linux  18      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   equivalent he or she is using, and drag it to the Chrome Extensions page. A dialog box should then display, asking the user to confirm that he or she wants to install it. Note that on ChromeOS, the file can’t be on the Google Drive; the user must place it in the Downloads directory or on an external device  hard drive, USB stick, or SD card . The installation instructions are somewhat tricky, so you might find that self-publishing is much less convenient than using the Chrome Web Store.  Publishing on the Chrome Web Store Unlike Apple, which has a fairly rigorous, arbitrary, and slow  measured in weeks  approval process for its store, Google doesn’t seem to care what’s put into its store, and it makes new and updated apps available within hours. You can even upload apps that are restricted to a group of testers. When I signed up, there was a one-time fee of $5 to use the store  Apple charges about $100 per year . You need a ZIP file of the app’s folder  ending with .zip , not a CRX file. And, be aware that you can’t just change the filename of a CRX file to end with .zip, because it’s not exactly a ZIP file. You have to zip the folder by using whatever your operating system’s file browser  Finder, Windows Explorer, Chrome OS Files app, and so on  provides or by using a separate ZIP utility. To begin, go to the Chrome Developer Dashboard, sign in with your Google account  if you’re not already signed in , and pay the fee. Next, click the “Add new item” button and upload your app. You’ll then be presented with a form where you enter a detailed description; the app’s icon  the same file that’s referenced by the manifest, in most cases ; some screenshots; some promotional tile images; your website URL; the regions where you want the app distributed; the pricing  if it isn’t free ; the language; whether it’s “mature content”; and whether it’s for all users, only people with the link, or just trusted testers, possibly including members of a Google Group that you own or manage. I won’t go into the details of all these fields; Google has lots of documentation and advice to which you can refer. After your app is in the store, anyone you’ve allowed to access it can install it right from the store, without dealing with the Extensions page at all. The Chrome Dev Editor automates the job of zipping and uploading your app, although you still have to fill out the submission form the usual way. From the menu, just choose Publish to Chrome Web Store.  Publishing a Chrome App      19  www.it-ebooks.info   Unpacked Folders, CRX Files, and ZIP Files  I’ve explained in the text where and when you use these three forms of a Chrome App, but I don’t blame you for confusing them  I did myself at one time , so here’s another explanation all in one place: Unpacked folder  Used during development. Installed from the Extensions page by using the “Load unpacked extension” button.  CRX file  ZIP file  Created with the “Pack extension” button. Used only for self-publishing. Installed by dragging it to the Extensions page. Filename ends in .crx.  Created  with  your  operating  system’s  file  browser   Finder,  Windows  Explorer, Chrome OS Files, and so on . Needed to upload an app to the Chrome Web Store. Not needed if you publish from within the Chrome Dev Editor. Filename ends in .zip.  If you think it’s strange that the Chrome Web Store doesn’t just accept a CRX file, I’m with you.  Chapter Summary In this chapter we explored how to build a minimal Chrome App; identified its principal parts such as the manifest.json file; and saw how to run it, debug it, and publish it. Now you’re ready to start exploring the Chrome APIs, many of which are available only to Chrome Apps.  20      Chapter 1: Your First Chrome App  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 2 Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  The subject of this chapter and that of Chapter 3 is storage outside of an app’s memory that persists from launch to launch. Chrome Apps can access seven types of storage  see Table 2-1 , which offer the following three kinds of data structures: files  Named files organized by a hierarchy of directories  KVP  indexed KVP objects  Key-value pairs, which are a collection of keys and their values  Key-value pairs organized into objects that are indexed for speedy access  Some storage is sandboxed, which means that it’s accessible only to the app, determined by the app ID, and kept separately for each user, determined by his or her Google ac‐ count. Storage might also be synchronized  synced, for short, which we’ll use throughout this chapter and elsewhere in the book , which means that it’s automatically copied to multiple computers to keep them consistent. As Table 2-1 shows, Local Files and IndexedDB are standard APIs available to any web page, whereas the others are only for Chrome Apps.1 There is a standard API for Local Storage, as well, but it’s not available to Chrome Apps, and the Chrome API variant is better anyway. Some browsers, including Chrome, implement a Web SQL Database API, but it’s not available to Chrome Apps either. We explore the first three types of storage in this chapter, Chapter 3 discusses the three KVP storage types, and Chapter 5 looks at Media Galleries.  1. Some are available to Extensions, but my focus is on Chrome Apps.  www.it-ebooks.info  21   Table 2-1. Storage available to Chrome Apps Storage  Sandboxed?  Structure  Sync?  Chrome Apps only? no yes yes  yes  yes  no  no yes no  no  yes  no  no  yes  file file file  Local Files Sync Files External Files Local Storage Sync Storage IndexedDB indexed  KVP  KVP  KVP objects file  Media Galleries  yes yes no  yes  yes  yes  no  The file-structured storage types provide different APIs for getting at files, but after you access a file, they use the same API for reading, writing, truncating, and seeking via a FileEntry object. That common API is discussed in the next section. We’ll start out with a simple note-taking example—let’s call it the Note app to make it easy on ourselves—using Local Files. Then, we’ll enhance it to use Sync Files. Finally, we’ll turn it into a simple text editor by modifying it to use External Files. Chapter 3 continues the example by adding options for colors that are stored in Local Storage and then Sync Storage. It’s best to read this and the next chapters sequentially so that you can follow the example code. Local Files Local files have many of the features you’d expect: hierarchical directories, random access, and reading and writing. What they don’t have is any way to access them outside of a single app’s sandbox. They’re tied to an app ID and user and hidden very deeply in the computer’s filesystem. To give you an idea of how hidden, the example file that I use for demonstration in this chapter is stored on my computer here:   Users marc Library Application Support Google Chrome  Default Storage ext  jncbmmfnahjgnlehenndimadigaignfl  def File System primary p 00 00000001  The name I gave it, note.txt is nowhere to be found. That’s because it’s inside a Google LevelDB database, also stashed in an obscure place. So, a local file isn’t meant to be seen  22      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   by anything outside the app that created it. That limitation aside, we can still build a note-taking app that saves its text in a local file and then retrieves it again when it’s relaunched.  Occasionally,  you  need  to  know  an  app’s  ID.  To  find  it,  go  to  the Extensions  page  and  look  in  the  app’s  section,  as  illustrated  in Figure 2-1.  Figure 2-1. Getting an ID for an app  Local files were introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C  as part of its HTML5 development, and they’re available to all Chrome web pages, not just Chrome Apps. The file API that they use is also used with the Chrome-App-only APIs, so it’s important that you understand how to use it. I’ll explain the basics here—everything we’ll need to work with the apps in this book. For more detailed information on this, read Using the HTML5 Filesystem API by Eric Bidelman  O’Reilly . To use local files, you proceed in steps, and there are more steps than you’d think would be needed. First, you get a filesystem, then a directory entry, then a file entry, then a file writer, then a blob, and, finally, you write the blob. As we build the Note app, I’ll break down the steps into separate functions so that you can follow what’s going on. Otherwise, the cascade of callbacks would be impenetrable. The Note app is pretty simple, as you can see in Figure 2-2. There’s a text area in which you can type and a Save button that you click to save your work. When you launch the app, what you’ve previously saved appears in the text area.  Local Files      23  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-2. Our Note app after saving  The app’s background.js file is exactly the same as the one for the Converter app we created in Chapter 1, and its manifest is almost the same, except for a permission that I’ll describe shortly. The index.html is about what you’d expect:                   Note                  &nbsp;       Save                FileSystem and DirectoryEntry An app can’t just begin manipulating files without a formal introduction. It must first request a filesystem and a space allocation with a call to requestFileSystem:  requestFileSystem type, size, successCallback, errorCallback   type is either PERSISTENT, which means that the data you write stays until you delete it, or TEMPORARY, which means that the browser can delete the data if it wants to, like a  24      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   cache. The W3C standard doesn’t say how long a browser is obligated to keep temporary storage, but you can assume it will stay around at least as long as the app is running. The idea behind the  size argument is that the user might be asked to approve that amount of space. However, Chrome Apps never do that. Instead, my testing indicates that you need to request the unlimitedStorage permission in the manifest, like this:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "Note",     "version": "1.0.0",     "permissions": [         "unlimitedStorage"     ] }  I’ve seen some documentation that suggests the user has to agree to this permission when the app is installed, but I’ve never seen that with an actual app. Chrome OS calls this API webkitRequestFileSystem, whereas Cordova  an Android  iOS platform for Chrome Apps, which is discussed in Appendix D  calls it requestFi leSystem, so it’s best to figure out which it is and call that one. You can see this technique in the onload handler, which also sets up the Save button:  window.onload = function    {     var requestFileSystem = window.webkitRequestFileSystem        window.requestFileSystem;     requestFileSystem PERSISTENT, 0, haveFileSystem, errorHandler ;     document.querySelector "save" .addEventListener "click", save ; };  The requestFileSystem API is the first of many that we’ll see that are asynchronous. This means that it returns right away, but with its actual work deferred until later. Be‐ cause JavaScript is single-threaded, that can’t happen until the onload handler returns, but when it actually happens is outside of the app’s control. When the request is ready, the success callback haveFileSystem is called  we’ll see it soon .  Using Asynchronous Calls Correctly  If you’ve used another programming language for which system calls are mostly syn‐ chronous, you might be tempted to request a filesystem like this:  var fs = requestFileSystem PERSISTENT, 0 ;    wrong  Local Files      25  www.it-ebooks.info   If you do this in a Chrome App, you’ll find that fs is undefined. Perhaps a more common mistake is to make the call correctly but assume that you can use the results right away:  var fileSystem; requestFileSystem PERSISTENT, 0,     function  fs  {         fileSystem = fs;     }  ; fileSystem.root.getDirectory "Note", gotDirectory ;    wrong  Any processing that needs the FileSystem must be deferred until the requestFileSys tem success callback has been called  no need for the global :  requestFileSystem PERSISTENT, 0,     function  fs  {         fs.root.getDirectory "Note", gotDirectory ;     }  ;  The code in the Note app example is structured a bit differently, but you’ll see that all processing that depends on the result of an asynchronous call is properly sequenced.  The error callback is errorHandler, which goes to considerable lengths to figure out where a useful error message might be. We’ll use this error handler over and over; in the interest of brevity, I won’t show the code each time we use it in an app, so here it is:  function errorHandler e  {     console.dir e ;     var msg;     if  e.target && e.target.error          e = e.target.error;     if  e.message          msg = e.message;     else if  e.name          msg = e.name;     else if  e.code          msg = "Code " + e.code;     else         msg = e.toString  ;     showMessage 'Error: ' + msg ; }  Showing Transient Messages We’ll be calling showMessage—which is what the errorHandler calls—any time we need to display a message to the user, not only in the Note app, but throughout this book. We don’t want messages to stay around forever, because after a while they’re no longer meaningful. For example, the message “Saved” is fine just after a save, but when the user begins typing it’s misleading. So, we use a timer to get rid of a message after five seconds:  26      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   var timeoutID;  function showMessage msg, good  {     console.log msg ;     var messageElement = document.querySelector "message" ;     messageElement.style.color = good ? "green" : "red";     messageElement.innerHTML = msg;     if  timeoutID          clearTimeout timeoutID ;     timeoutID = setTimeout          function    {             messageElement.innerHTML = "&nbsp;";         },         5000      ; }  Recall that there was a   element with the ID message in index.html. We clear the message by setting to a nonbreaking space  rather than an empty string  so that the vertical layout in the window won’t change as messages come and go.  Curly Braces  In his terrific book JavaScript: The Good Parts  O’Reilly , Douglas Crockford suggests using curly braces for all if statements, even when the body is a single statement. Fol‐ lowing those recommendations, the errorHandler function would be coded like this:  function errorHandler e  {     console.dir e ;     var msg;     if  e.target && e.target.error  {         e = e.target.error;     }     if  e.message  {         msg = e.message;     }     else if  e.name  {         msg = e.name;     }     else if  e.code  {         msg = "Code " + e.code;     }     else {         msg = e.toString  ;     }     showMessage 'Error: ' + msg ; }  Local Files      27  www.it-ebooks.info   As you’ve noticed, I don’t follow Crockford’s curly-brace advice, mostly because I don’t like the added clutter. But Crockford is probably right, and I’m a bad example.  Getting DirectoryEntrys Getting back to the requestFileSystem call in the onload handler, the haveFileSystem function receives the requested filesystem:  var directoryEntry;  function haveFileSystem fs  {     fs.root.getDirectory "Note",         {             create: true,             exclusive: false         },         function  de  {             directoryEntry = de;             read  ;         },         errorHandler      ; }  Here we get a DirectoryEntry for the directory to hold the note: getDirectory path, options, successCallback, errorCallback   The path can have multiple levels, but any parent directories in it must already exist. The options argument can have two optional Boolean keys. The first, create, means that the directory is created if necessary; if create is missing or false, the call fails if the directory isn’t there. If the second option, exclusive, is true, creation fails if the directory already exists. If neither option is true, the call succeeds only if the directory exists. Most commonly, you specify create: true when you want to create the directory if needed, which is what we did here, and no options if the directory must already exist.  It’s meaningless for both create and exclusive to be true.  There’s no concept of getting a DirectoryEntry for reading or writing; it can always do both. You can also remove a directory and all its contents, across multiple levels:  removeRecursively successCallback, errorCallback   You can read the contents of a directory by using the createReader method, but I won’t go into the details. Looking back at the success callback, we save the DirectoryEntry for later use and call read to read the note and display it in the text area. We’ll see read itself soon.  28      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting FileEntrys and Creating FileWriters Given a DirectoryEntry, you can also get a FileEntry by using the call:  getFile path, options, successCallback, errorCallback   This call is much like getDirectory, except that the success callback gets a FileEntry. Because there are a couple places in the Note app where we’ll need a FileEntry, there’s a function to get one:  var fileEntry; var fileWriter;  function getFileEntry callback  {     if  fileWriter          callback  ;     else if  directoryEntry  {         directoryEntry.getFile 'note.txt',             {                 create: true,                 exclusive: false             },             function  fe  {                 fileEntry = fe;                 fileEntry.createWriter                      function  fw  {                         fileWriter = fw;                         callback  ;                     },                     errorHandler                  ;             },             errorHandler          ;     } }  The only file this app needs is note.txt in the directory we already have an entry for, Note. If getFile succeeds, we save the FileEntry it got in the global fileEntry and go on to create a FileWriter by using the call:  createWriter successCallback, errorCallback   By now, you’re getting into the swing of things, so you’ve probably already guessed that the FileWriter is passed to the success callback—and you’re right! We save it in the global fileWriter. Then, with both the FileEntry and a FileWriter saved, we call the callback. Note that the errorHandler we saw earlier is used for the error callbacks.  Writing a File with the FileWriter API The FileWriter methods are:  Local Files      29  www.it-ebooks.info   write data ; truncate size ; seek offset ;  You write a Blob by using write, always at the current position, which you can query  but not change  by referencing the read-only position property. To change it, you call seek, which is the only one of the three methods that’s synchronous, because all it does is set a property. Another property is length, and you can change that by using the truncate method.  Blobs  A JavaScript Blob represents raw data constructed from an Array of parts, each of which can be, among other things, a string or a Blob, as shown in the following example:  var blob = new Blob ["Here's a string."], {type: 'text plain'} ;  Note that the first argument is an Array, not a plain string. A File object, which is what you get when you read a FileEntry, is a subclass of Blob. Think of a File as the data in a file, not the file itself as it exists on the filesystem. There are various methods and properties of a Blob and a File that you might need at some point, but I won’t go into them here, because all we need for the Note app is the constructor. You can read all about them in a good JavaScript book such as JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan  O’Reilly . Or, you can go to the entry for Blob on the Mozilla Developer Network.  If a file exists, setting create: true when we get its FileEntry has no effect, unlike with most other operating systems, for which a “create” option truncates an existing file. With the FileWriter APIs, if you want to truncate the file, you must do it explicitly, and, because that’s asynchronous, you have to ensure that truncation is complete before you write. That’s what the save function  the Save button click handler  does:  function save   {     getFileEntry          function   {             fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                 fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                     dirty = false;                     showMessage "Saved", true ;                 };                 var blob = new Blob [document.querySelector "textarea" .value],                   {type: 'text plain'} ;                 fileWriter.write blob ;             };             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;  30      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info               fileWriter.truncate 0 ;         }      ; }  The handler calls getFileEntry, which we just saw. When the callback is executed, we have a FileWriter  saved earlier in the global fileWriter , and we use the FileWrit er API to truncate the file and write the contents of the text area to it as a Blob.  Ignore the setting of the dirty flag for now; I’ll explain it later in this chapter.  It’s very important that the write occur after the truncate has completed, which is how the save is coded. Don’t do it this way:  fileWriter.truncate 0 ; fileWriter.write blob ;    wrong -- truncate not completed  You might think that truncate is fast enough so that it’s likely to complete before the write is issued, but the single-threadedness of JavaScript makes that impossible, because the truncate can’t even begin until JavaScript execution returns to the system. For the same reason, in the save function, it doesn’t matter whether you set the onwrite handler before or after you issue the FileWriter operation. After you’ve written to a file, although it’s very difficult to find it on your computer’s filesystem, you can easily view it in the Developer Tools Resources tab, as shown in Figure 2-3.  Figure 2-3. note.txt shown in Developer Tools  Reading a File Now  let’s  look  at  read,  which  was  called  from  haveFileSystem  after  we  got  the DirectoryEntry:  function read   {     getFileEntry          function   {             if  fileEntry   Local Files      31  www.it-ebooks.info                   fileEntry.file haveFile, errorHandler ;         }      ; }  function haveFile file  {     var reader = new FileReader  ;     reader.onload = function   {         document.querySelector "textarea" .value = reader.result;     };     reader.readAsText file ; }  The read function calls getFileEntry, just as save did, but this time we call the Fil eEntry method file to get a File object  a subclass of a Blob , which is passed to the haveFile success callback. With the File, we create a FileReader object, call its read AsText message with the File as the argument, and then stick the result into the text area when it’s available.  It might seem strange that writing and reading are done completely differently: you get a FileWriter from the FileEntry when you want to write, but you get a File  a Blob  from the FileEntry when you want to read, and create the FileReader separately. You could argue that a FileEntry should deliver a FileReader, so reading is more like writing, but that’s not the way they designed it.  Auto-Saving and Idle Events Unlike other platforms, such as Mac OS X or Windows, Chrome doesn’t inform an app when it’s about to terminate, which is something you might want to know about so you can save the user’s work. Such an event was omitted deliberately for Chrome Apps because it can never be relied upon, given that the application might terminate because of a computer crash or power failure. Not having the event forces you to design your application so that it continuously saves the state of the user’s work, which is a much more reliable approach. But first, before we can implement auto-saving, we have to know if the user changed anything. In the simple Note app, there’s only the text area to worry about, and we can observe changes there by listening for four text-area events: keypress, paste, cut, and change. But, none of those four fires when the text is changed by pressing the Backspace or Delete keys, so you need to test for those actions explicitly by listening for a key down event and checking the keyCode property of the event against 8 and 46, the codes for backspace and delete. Upon any change, a global flag, dirty, is set:  32      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   var dirty = false;  function setupAutoSave   {     var taElement = document.querySelector "textarea" ;     taElement.addEventListener "keypress", didChange ;     taElement.addEventListener "paste", didChange ;     taElement.addEventListener "cut", didChange ;     taElement.addEventListener "change", didChange ;     taElement.addEventListener "keydown", didChange ; }  function didChange e  {     if  e.type !== 'keydown'        e.keyCode === 8  e.keyCode === 46     backspace or delete         dirty = true; }  Listening for a change event is insufficient by itself, because it only fires when the text area loses focus, and that might not happen for minutes, or even hours, which isn’t safe. We add a call to setupAutoSave to the end of the onload handler:  window.onload = function    {        ...     setupAutoSave  ; };  Now, the dirty flag indicates whether the text has been changed since the last save. Looking back at the code for the save function, that’s why the flag was turned off with a successful save:  function save   {        ...                 fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                     dirty = false;                     showMessage "Saved", true ;                 };        ... }  There are a couple of ways to save automatically:    Checking the dirty flag at regular intervals, such as every 15 seconds   Checking the flag when the app becomes idle; that is, no user input for a defined  interval  Waiting until the app is idle is a little better because there’s no point saving while the user is actively typing. That’s easy to implement with the chrome.idle API:  chrome.idle.setDetectionInterval 15 ;  chrome.idle.onStateChanged.addListener   Auto-Saving and Idle Events      33  www.it-ebooks.info       function  state  {         if  state === "idle" && dirty              save  ;     }  ;  The StateChanged event fires when the idle state changes, testing it every 15 seconds  the minimum allowed . It can be active, idle, or locked. The locked state means that the screen is locked or the screensaver is activated. All we care about is idle, in which case save is called if the text area is dirty  modified since the last save . Use of chrome.idle requires that we request idle permission; thus the permissions in manifest.json need to be changed to the following:  "permissions": [     "unlimitedStorage",     "idle" ]  We’ll keep the Save button, although typically note-taking apps don’t have one  for example, Google’s Keep app doesn’t . Sync Files A note-taking app that keeps its note hidden away on a single computer isn’t really that useful. Modern note-takers sync their notes so that they’re available on whatever device you’re using and, as a bonus, automatically backed up. It’s surprisingly easy to modify our Note app to sync; all we need to do is use the Sync FileSystem, available only to Chrome Apps.  How Syncing Works The Sync FileSystem keeps a local copy of directories and files, and you code input and output  I O  between the application and that local copy, just as you do for Local Files. In the background, a system task built into Chrome copies data back and forth between the local copy and a copy on Google Drive, called the remote copy. There might be a delay of a minute or so before this syncing occurs. If syncing isn’t active, perhaps because the computer is offline, I O between the app and the local copy proceeds normally, and syncing occurs sometime later, when the computer again has access to the Internet. To show how the Sync FileSystem works, we’ll modify the Note app so that it syncs. Anything typed or otherwise modified is written to the Sync FileSystem  a local copy, that is  and then eventually synced with the remote copy on Google Drive. If the file is changed by another computer, an event is fired, alerting the app that the local copy changed and that the text area should be updated. Figure 2-4 illustrates our Note app running on two computers, showing the local copies of the note.txt file that contains the note, and the remote copy.  34      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-4. Two installations of Note synced to a shared remote copy  The local copy used by the Sync FileSystem isn’t the same one used by Local Files. These are two separate sandboxes. Figure 2-5 shows the new Note app running after some text has been typed.  Figure 2-5. Note app showing file status after text has been typed  One thing that’s new is the file status  “pending”  at the bottom; this was put there by a function that we’ll see as we go through the code. Here’s the new index.html:  Sync Files      35  www.it-ebooks.info                    Note                  &nbsp;                File Status:          Making the Note App Sync After we get a syncing  FileSystem, how we deal with  DirectoryEntry,  FileEntry, FileWriter, and the other file objects is the same as before; therefore, we can retain most of the Note app code, and I won’t repeat those functions that are exactly the same here. You request a sync FileSystem by calling chrome.syncFileSystem.requestFileSys tem, whose only argument is the callback:  chrome.syncFileSystem.requestFileSystem callback   Because there’s no separate error callback, we have to check chrome.runtime.lastEr ror, as you can see in the modified onload handler:  window.onload = function    {     chrome.syncFileSystem.requestFileSystem          function  fs  {             if  chrome.runtime.lastError                  showMessage chrome.runtime.lastError.message ;             else                 haveFileSystem fs ;         }      ;     setupAutoSave  ; };  We’ve tossed out the Save button, so the code to set up its event handler is gone. On success, we call haveFileSystem, which is exactly as before. Recall that its job is to get the DirectoryEntry for the Note directory and then call the read function. What is changed is the getFileEntry function, which both read and save call. In the earlier version, we just created the file if it didn’t exist, but now that we’re syncing, we can’t do that. Here’s the problem: suppose that the syncing Note app is installed on a new computer. Initially, there’s no note.txt file on that computer, but it’s possible that after a few seconds the current version will be synced down from Google Drive. Mean‐  36      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   while, if we had created the file, that would count as a change, and it’s possible that the new empty file would overwrite the saved one. So, for any call to read, if the file doesn’t exist, we don’t want to create it. However, for save, we do want to create a nonexistent file because we really do need to write it. We modify getFileEntry to take a first argument that indicates the value of the create option:  var fileEntry; var fileWriter;  function getFileEntry create, callback  {     if  fileWriter          callback  ;     else if  directoryEntry  {         directoryEntry.getFile 'note.txt',             {                 create: create,                 exclusive: false             },             function  fe  {                 fileEntry = fe;                 fileEntry.createWriter                      function  fw  {                         fileWriter = fw;                         callback  ;                     },                     errorHandler                  ;             },             function  e  {                 if  e.name === 'NotFoundError'                      callback  ;                 else                     errorHandler e ;             }          ;     } }  With this change, if create is false, an error occurs if the file doesn’t exist. Accordingly, we check for that particular error and just execute the callback in that case. To see how the new getFileEntry is used, here’s the modified read function  called from haveFileSystem, as before :  function read   {     showFileStatus  ;     getFileEntry false,         function   {             if  fileEntry                  fileEntry.file haveFile, errorHandler ;  Sync Files      37  www.it-ebooks.info           }      ; }  function haveFile file  {     var reader = new FileReader  ;     reader.onload = function   {         document.querySelector "textarea" .value = reader.result;     };     reader.readAsText file ; }  The call to getFileEntry now has a first argument of false. If the file doesn’t exist, fileEntry is undefined, so the text area remains empty. If the file isn’t on Google Drive either, empty is how the text area should remain, until the user types. We’ll see soon what happens if the file is on Google Drive and is synced down later. The call at the top to showFileStatus shows the file status; I’ll get to that in a bit. The save function operates exactly as it did for local files because the first argument to the new getFileEntry is true:  function save   {     getFileEntry true,         function   {             fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                 fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                     dirty = false;                     showMessage "Saved", true ;                 };                 var blob = new Blob [document.querySelector "textarea" .value],                   {type: 'text plain'} ;                 fileWriter.write blob ;             };             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;             fileWriter.truncate 0 ;         }      ; }  Now that there is no longer a Save button, save is called only from the chrome.idle.on StateChanged event handler.  Listening for the FileStatusChanged Event The app needs to show the note if it has been synchronized down from Google Drive. To do that, it sets a listener for the  chrome.syncFileSystem.onFileStatusChanged event:   chrome.syncFileSystem.onFileStatusChanged.addListener       function  detail  {  38      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info            if  detail.fileEntry.name === "note.txt"  {              showMessage detail.fileEntry.name + " &bull; " +                detail.direction + " &bull; " + detail.action +                " &bull; " + detail.status, true ;              if  detail.direction === 'remote_to_local' &&                detail.status === 'synced'                   read  ;              showFileStatus detail.status ;          }      }   ;  When the event fires, it means that the background syncing has changed the file status, and the event handler is called with a detail object that has the following four prop‐ erties: fileEntry  The FileEntry for the file whose status has changed. It has two interesting prop‐ erties: name, which we’re using in the example code, and path.  One of synced, pending, or conflicting. A conflict occurs if two or more local copies on different devices have been changed. By default, that won’t occur, because the last writer prevails. However, you can call  chrome.syncFileSystem.setCon flictResolutionPolicy to set the policy to manual, in which case conflicts won’t be resolved automatically. The default is last_write_win, and that’s what you’ll almost always want.  Set if the status is synced; one of added, updated, or deleted.  status  action  direction  Either local_to_remote or remote_to_local.  In the code, all four properties are used to display a status message by using showMes sage, and the file status is shown by showFileStatus, which we’ll see in a moment. For example, after I typed on my Mac, the message in Figure 2-6 appeared after a few seconds. Figure 2-7 shows the Note app running on my Windows computer after I typed a bit more text. You can see that local changes were copied up to the remote  Google Drive , which were then copied down. All of this was entirely automatic. The application only knew about the change to the remote copy from the event that was fired.  Sync Files      39  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-6. The Note app after local-to-remote sync  Figure 2-7. The Note app after remote-to-local sync  40      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   Going back to the event handler, the purpose of the following code is to show the note if it was just copied from Google Drive:  if  detail.direction === 'remote_to_local' &&   detail.status === 'synced'          read  ;  That’s what causes all instances of the app to show the same text after syncing. If the file didn’t exist when the app was first started, causing read to do nothing back then, when the event fires the file will exist and the call to read will display it in the text area. We don’t care to do anything when a local_to_remote event occurs, other than to show the status on the screen. Because the text being synced is already in the text area, it doesn’t have to be updated.  Showing File Status The showFileStatus function updates the status shown at the bottom of the window. It uses the chrome.syncFileSystem.getFileStatus API to get the status if none was passed in. If there’s no FileEntry because no local copy yet exists, the notation “no local copy” is displayed:  function showFileStatus status  {     var statusElement = document.querySelector "status" ;     if  status          statusElement.innerHTML = status;     else         getFileEntry false,             function   {                 if  fileEntry                      chrome.syncFileSystem.getFileStatus fileEntry,                         function  status  {                             statusElement.innerHTML = status;                         }                      ;                 else                     statusElement.innerHTML = "no local copy";             }          ; }  There’s also a call to showFileStatus added to the end of showMessage. This causes the status to display whenever a message  such as “Saved”  is shown:  function showMessage msg, good  {        ...     showFileStatus  ; }  Sync Files      41  www.it-ebooks.info   Finding Remote Copies on Google Drive If you browse your directories on Google Drive, you won’t find the remote copies. However, if you really want to see them, you can open up your Google Drive in a browser window and click the All Items link at the left, as illustrated in Figure 2-8.  Figure 2-8. Sync directory and file on Google Drive  It’s undocumented what happens if you make changes directly on Google Drive—they might not be synced—so don’t do it. File access should be only through the Sync File‐ System APIs. External Files Local Files are of limited use because its infeasible to find them on the local filesystem and, even if you could find them, how and where they’re stored isn’t documented and probably will change at some point. That limits such files to data completely internal to the application, which is useless for applications such as text editors or image viewers. Sync Files have their uses, of course, but they also are captives of the app’s sandbox. However, because Chrome Apps run with much tighter security than ordinary web apps, they can use an API that provides access to any user-visible directory or file on the computer, with only one restriction: the user must explicitly choose the file or the di‐ rectory it’s in, via file-open or file-save dialogs, the same ones you see on native apps.  Media files are an exception; see “The mediaGalleries API” on page 173 for an alternative way to access them.  External  Files  use  the  same  file  API  as  Local  Files  and  Sync  Files,  except  for  two differences:  42      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info     You use  chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry to show a file-open save dialog that provides a FileEntry object. When you have one of those, you manipulate it the usual way, as we’ve been doing.    You don’t have to request a filesystem, because chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry  knows what filesystem to use.  A Simple Editor Figure 2-9 shows the Simple Editor example app that I’ll use to illustrate the use of the chrome.fileSystem API:  Figure 2-9. The Simple Editor app  After typing some text into the text area and clicking the Save button, a standard save- file dialog opens, as shown in Figure 2-10.  External Files      43  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-10. The Simple Editor save-file dialog  To open another file, I can click the Open button to get a standard file-open dialog, as depicted in Figure 2-11. Simple Editor is based on the Note app that we worked on earlier in this chapter and resembles it in many ways. Here’s the index.html file:                   SimpleEditor                         New       Open...       Save       Save As...       &nbsp;              44      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-11. The Simple Editor open-file dialog  Note that the Dialogs.js file  see Appendix A  is included so that the Simple Editor app can pop up a modal dialog, as we’ll see a little later.  Is a Text Area the Right Choice?  A text area is fine for the examples in this book, but it falls well short of what you need for a real text editor. You’ll likely want find-and-replace, syntax highlighting, line num‐ bers, automatic indent and outdent, and much more. The open source, embeddable code editor Ace is a better choice, and it works well in Chrome Apps. It’s what the Chrome Dev Editor uses.  All of the JavaScript is in the window.onload handler; this ensures that all of the elements defined in the HTML have been created:  window.onload = function    {        ... entire app goes here ... };  External Files      45  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up handlers for the buttons and for reacting to changes in the text area is very close to what we’ve already seen:  var taElement = document.querySelector "textarea" ; var dirty = false;  document.querySelector "new" .addEventListener "click", newFile ; document.querySelector "open" .addEventListener "click", openFile ; document.querySelector "save" .addEventListener "click", saveFile ; document.querySelector "saveas" .addEventListener "click", saveFileAs ;  taElement.addEventListener "keypress", didChange ; taElement.addEventListener "paste", didChange ; taElement.addEventListener "cut", didChange ; taElement.addEventListener "change", didChange ; taElement.addEventListener "keydown", didChange ;  function didChange e  {     if  e.type !== 'keydown'        e.keyCode === 8  e.keyCode === 46     backspace or delete         dirty = true; }  The newFile and openFile functions store new contents into the text area, so it’s nec‐ essary to first check the dirty flag, which is done by dirtyCheck:  function dirtyCheck callback  {     if  dirty          Dialogs.confirm 'Discard changes?', 'Discard', 'Keep', callback ;     else         callback  ; }  If  dirty  is  set,  the  user  is  asked  whether  what’s  been  typed  should  be  discarded  Figure 2-12 .  Figure 2-12. The confirm dialog asking the user whether changes can be discarded  See Appendix A for how Dialogs.confirm is used. If the user chooses to discard the text, or if the flag is unset, the callback is called. If dirty is set but the user wants to keep the text, the callback isn’t called. That’s what’s done in newFile, the New button’s event handler:  46      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   function newFile   {     dirtyCheck          function   {             fileEntry = null;             taElement.value = "";             taElement.focus  ;             dirty = false;             document.title = 'Simple Editor - [new]';         }      ; }  If it’s OK to clear the text area, the dirty flag is turned off and the document name is reset.  Choosing Files and Directories Here is the API for choosing a file:  chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry options, callback   option has a type property with one of the following three values: openFile  Get a FileEntry for an existing file.  saveFile  Get a FileEntry for a file to be written.  openDirectory  Get a DirectoryEntry.  The option you pick interacts with the permissions in the manifest. You need at least fileSystem permission, which allows you to open a file for reading and nothing else:  If you add write, you can also save a file, and any file opened is available for both reading and writing, which is what Simple Editor needs:  "permissions": [     "fileSystem" ]  "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write"         ]     } ]  If you add the directory permission, you can use the openDirectory option. To enable writing, you must also have asked for write permission, like this:  External Files      47  www.it-ebooks.info   "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "directory",             "write"         ]     } ]  If  chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry isn’t canceled by the user, the callback is called with a FileEntry as an argument, and you can use any of the methods that we saw earlier in this chapter, just as with Local Files and Sync Files. Now, the openFile function—the Open button’s event handler—should be understand‐ able, especially as we’ve already seen how a FileEntry is manipulated:  var fileEntry;  function openFile   {     dirtyCheck          function   {             chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry                  {                     type: 'openFile'                 },                 function  fe  {                     if  fe  {                         fileEntry = fe;                         fe.file                              function  file  {                                 var reader = new FileReader  ;                                 reader.onloadend = function e  {                                     taElement.value = this.result;                                     taElement.focus  ;                                     dirty = false;                                     showMessage 'Opened OK', true ;                                     document.title = 'Simple Editor - ' + fe.name;                                 };                                 reader.readAsText file ;                             },                             errorHandler                          ;                     }                 }              ;         }      ; }  There are two things to note here: we save the FileEntry in a global variable, and the dirty flag is turned off.  48      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   The saveFile function also calls chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry but with a different option:  function saveFile   {     if  fileEntry          save  ;     else         chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry              {                 type: 'saveFile'             },             function  fe  {                 if  fe  {                     fileEntry = fe;                     save  ;                     document.title = 'Simple Editor - ' + fe.name;                 }             }          ; }  Keep in mind that if the global fileEntry is set, the file to be saved is the same one that was opened, so we just save without prompting the user for a filename. The actual work of saving is done by save—the Save button’s event handler—which is almost identical to the one in the Note app:  function save   {     fileEntry.createWriter          function fileWriter  {             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;             fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                 fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                     showMessage 'Saved OK', true ;                     dirty = false;                     taElement.focus  ;                 };                 var blob = new Blob [taElement.value],                   {type: 'text plain'} ;                 fileWriter.write blob ;             };             fileWriter.truncate 0 ;         },         errorHandler      ; }  Observe that once more we turn off the dirty flag. Given the way saveFile is constructed, saveFileAs  the “Save As” button’s event han‐ dler , can piggyback on it by just killing fileEntry first:  External Files      49  www.it-ebooks.info   function saveFileAs   {     fileEntry = null;     saveFile  ; }  The showMessage and errorHandler functions are almost identical to those we’ve al‐ ready seen, so I’m not going to show them again. Adding Backup by Using Retained File Entries Suppose that you want to add a backup feature to Simple Editor so that it automatically keeps a second copy when a file is saved. The obvious way to do that is for the user to choose a backup directory, and then the app can create as many files as you want in that directory. However, it’s inconvenient for the user to choose the backup directory every time the app is launched. That should be done just once, when the app is used for the first time, or maybe on rare occasions when the user wants to change it. To accommodate this, the chrome.fileSystem API has retained file entries that can be saved and reused without having to create them fresh each time with chrome.fileSys tem.chooseEntry. The rule that the user must have chosen the directory is still obeyed, just maybe sometime in the distant past. A good place to save the retained entry is in local storage, along with other app prefer‐ ences. We’ll see the local-storage API in the next chapter; for now we’ll use two higher- level functions whose code we’ll defer showing until then:  setParams x ;  getParams x, callback ;  For setParams, the argument is an object that’s saved in local storage, like this:  setParams { BackupFolderID: entryID } ;  For getParams, the argument is a key whose value is wanted, or an array of such keys, and the retrieved keys and their values are passed as an object to the callback function, like this:  getParams "BackupFolderID",     function  items  {            do something with items.BackupFolderID     }  ;  To see how all this works in practice, we’ll modify Simple Editor to back up any saved files. I’ll show only the new stuff, as most of the app won’t change.  50      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 2-13 shows Simple Editor after the backup has been set with a standard directory- choosing  dialog.   We’ll  see  how  shortly.   The  chosen  backup  path  is  momentarily displayed.  Figure 2-13. Simple Editor after setting the backup directory  In the manifest, we need directory and retainEntries permissions for the fileSys tem. We also need  storage permission so that we can save the  DirectoryEntry for backups in local storage with setParams and getParams:  "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write",             "directory",             "retainEntries"         ]     },     "storage" ]  var directoryEntryBackup;  function setBackup   {     chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry {             type: 'openDirectory'         },         function  entry  {  Here’s a function, setBackup, to set the backup  we’ll see where it’s called later :  Adding Backup by Using Retained File Entries      51  www.it-ebooks.info               if  entry  {                 directoryEntryBackup = entry;                 var entryID = chrome.fileSystem.retainEntry entry ;                 setParams { BackupFolderID: entryID } ;                 show_backup_folder  ;             }             else                 showMessage "No folder chosen" ;         } ; }  The only thing here that we haven’t already seen is this line:  var entryID = chrome.fileSystem.retainEntry entry ;  This causes the DirectoryEntry to be retained and returns an ID to it that, unlike the DirectoryEntry itself, can be saved externally, which we do by saving it in local storage with setParams. Just to confirm that it was set, we call show_backup_folder to display the path to the backup directory:  function show_backup_folder   {     if  directoryEntryBackup          chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath directoryEntryBackup,             function  path  {                 showMessage 'Backup Folder: ' + path, true ;             } ;     else         showMessage 'No backup folder' ; }  We use the chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath API call to get a displayable path. To take advantage of the backup directory, we have to change the save function to save the file twice: once where the user wanted to save it, and once to the backup directory. The saveToEntry function handles the actual saving, given a FileEntry and a callback to be called when the file is saved:  function saveToEntry fe, callback  {     fe.createWriter          function fileWriter  {             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;             fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                 fileWriter.onwrite = function e  {                     callback  ;                 };                 var blob = new Blob [taElement.value],                   {type: 'text plain'} ;                 fileWriter.write blob ;             };             fileWriter.truncate 0 ;         },  52      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info           errorHandler      ; }  Now, we can implement the double save easily by calling saveToEntry twice  look in the middle for the second call :  function save   {     saveToEntry fileEntry,         function    {             dirty = false;             taElement.focus  ;             if  directoryEntryBackup                  directoryEntryBackup.getFile fileEntry.name,                     {                         create: true,                         exclusive: false                     },                     function  fe  {                         saveToEntry fe,                             function    {                                 showMessage 'Saved Backedup OK', true ;                             }                          ;                     },                     errorHandler                  ;             else                 showMessage 'Saved OK  no backup ', true ;         }      ; }  It’s not an error if the user never set a backup directory, but we do want to indicate that no backup was saved, which we do by displaying the message. Also, we don’t bother keeping the FileEntry for the backup around, as we did for the primary file, but just get a fresh one each time. So, that all works, but the entire point of a retained entry is that the user doesn’t have to set it each time the app launches. Because the ID is in local storage, all we need to do is add this code, which executes on every launch:  getParams "BackupFolderID",     function  items  {         if  chrome.runtime.lastError              showMessage 'Unable to get backup folder ID.  ' +               chrome.runtime.lastError.message + ' ' ;         else if  items && items.BackupFolderID              chrome.fileSystem.restoreEntry items.BackupFolderID,                 function  entry  {                     directoryEntryBackup = entry;                     show_backup_folder  ;  Adding Backup by Using Retained File Entries      53  www.it-ebooks.info                   }              ;         else             setBackup  ;     }  ;  Note the call to chrome.fileSystem.restoreEntry to get a DirectoryEntry back from the stored ID. If there’s no backup directory set, setBackup  which you just saw  is called to set it. This happens when the app is first launched; subsequent launches find that it’s already set. One toy-like limitation of this example is that there’s no directory tree in the backup directory, so files of the same name but in different directories will overwrite one an‐ other. What it takes to fix this defect is to use the complete path of the FileEntry to create all of the needed intermediate directories before saving the backup, a task I leave to you. Here’s another limitation: there’s not only no auto-save, but there’s not even a warning when the app exits. That’s not really a good design—it’s better to use the method that we used in the Note app to save automatically. Because it’s a text editor, users probably expect Save and Save As buttons, so you might want to retain those. We’re not finished with our editor. In Chapter 3, we’ll add options to set the text colors as well as a button with which the user can change the backup directory. Chapter Summary In this chapter, we discussed how to use Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files using HTML5 APIs and APIs unique to Chrome Apps. Our exploration continues in Chap‐ ter 3 with the key-value-pair APIs.  54      Chapter 2: Local Files, Sync Files, and External Files  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 3 Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  This chapter covers three more storage types first introduced in Table 2-1 in Chap‐ ter 2: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and the IndexedDB database. All three store key- value pairs  KVPs , not files. We’ll be extending the Simple Editor app from Chapter 2, using Local and Sync Storage. Then, I’ll introduce a mailing-list app to demonstrate what you can do with IndexedDB. Local and Sync Storage Many browsers, including Chrome, support localStorage, which is similar to persis‐ tent cookies in that it stores KVPs. The main difference is that localStorage has greater capacity and isn’t passed to the server along with HTTP requests. Similarly, session Storage is similar to session cookies in that it lasts only as long as the current session. However,  Chrome  Apps  can’t  use  localStorage.  Instead,  there’s  a  Chrome  API, chrome.storage.local, that’s better: it can store JavaScript objects  localStorage is limited to strings  and, like most Chrome APIs, it operates asynchronously, allowing the app to be more responsive. What’s more, there’s a variant, chrome.storage.sync, with the same API, which is automatically synchronized between computers running the same app, similar to the way that Sync Files are synchronized.  As is specified in Chapter 2, you need storage permission in your manifest to use the chrome.storage APIs.  www.it-ebooks.info  55   Chrome Apps can use sessionStorage, but there’s no reason to do so. Because a Chrome App HTML page can’t be refreshed and can’t navigate to another page in the same window, there’s no concept of session, and any global variables you define within your JavaScript will persist for as long as the window is open.  In case you were wondering, cookies don’t work in Chrome Apps, which is no loss.  chrome.storage.local persists even if the app is reinstalled, as long as its ID is the same. The ID is important also for  chrome.storage.sync, because this is what ties together the same app installed on multiple computers. You can think of the ID as identifying the storage. This means that the storage is really local, not only to your computer, but also to the app ID; there’s no way to share it between apps.  Setting and Getting Local Storage You set values in local storage by using chrome.storage.local.set:  chrome.storage.local.set items, callback   There’s a single callback. An error occurred if it’s called with chrome.runtime.lastEr ror defined; otherwise, setting succeeded. The items argument is an object whose keys are set to the corresponding values in local storage. Other keys already there are unaf‐ fected. To retrieve one or more keys from local storage, you call chrome.storage.local.get:  chrome.storage.local.get x, callback   The argument is the key to retrieve, or an array of keys to retrieve, or null to retrieve the entire contents of local storage  for this app . Here, too, the callback is for an error if chrome.runtime.lastError is defined. To see what you can expect to store and get back, consider this example:  var obj = {     k_array: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, "five", { number: "six" } ],     k_date: new Date  ,     k_function: function    { return 123; },     k_object: { k2_key1: "one", k2_key2: "two" },     k_regex:  abc ,     k_string: "string value" }; chrome.storage.local.set obj,     function    {         chrome.storage.local.get null,             function  items  {                 if  chrome.runtime.lastError                      console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ;                 else                     console.dir items ;             }  56      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info            ;     }  ;  Note the argument of null to the get function, called from the set callback. The console is shown in Figure 3-1.  Figure 3-1. A console showing local storage objects  You can see that strings and numbers are stored without problem, and so are arrays and objects that ultimately store strings and numbers, but dates, functions, and regular ex‐ pressions aren’t handled. The workaround is to store dates and regular expressions as strings. However, there’s no purpose in storing functions in local storage, so they don’t need a workaround. Local storage is best for small amounts of data, say a megabyte or two at most. It’s ideal for recording app preferences, as we’re about to see. For larger amounts of data, files or IndexedDB are better.  Implementing setParams and getParams The examples in Chapter 2 need to use local storage to store the backup directory’s entry ID, which is done through two wrapper functions, setParams and getParams, whose code we can now show:  function setParams x, wantSync  {     var storageArea = wantSync ? chrome.storage.sync : chrome.storage.local;     storageArea.set x,         function    {             if  chrome.runtime.lastError                  console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ;         }  Local and Sync Storage      57  www.it-ebooks.info        ; }  function getParams x, callback, wantSync  {     var storageArea = wantSync ? chrome.storage.sync : chrome.storage.local;     storageArea.get x,         function  items  {             if  chrome.runtime.lastError                  console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ;             else                 callback items ;         }      ; }  As we’ll see, the local and sync storage APIs are the same, except for the storage area object they operate on, so you can set an optional wantSync to true for sync storage. In Chapter 2, when these functions are first used, the argument is omitted, so the entry ID is stored in local storage, which is what is needed for the entry ID, because it’s inherently local.  Adding Color Options to the Simple Editor App To further show how you can use local storage to store and retrieve KVPs, we’ll modify Simple Editor to provide options for setting the text-area background and foreground colors. Figure 3-2 shows the new Options button, and Figure 3-3 shows the dialog that opens when you click it and select new colors. Figure 3-4 shows the new colors after you dismiss the dialog. Let’s look only at the changes to implement the color options. First, there’s another line of HTML in index.html for the Options button:  ...  Save As...   Options...   &nbsp;     ...  58      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-2. Simple Editor with default colors  Figure 3-3. The color-choosing dialog with color picker  Local and Sync Storage      59  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-4. Simple Editor with new colors applied  The event handler is set for the Options button like so:  var optionsButton = document.querySelector "options" ; if  optionsButton      optionsButton.addEventListener "click", options ;  function options   {     var bg;     var fg;     Dialogs.dialog          " Background Color:  " +         " Foreground Color:  " +         "  Set Backup... " +         "  OK ",         [             {                 id: 'dlg-ok',                 action: function    {                     setBackground bg.value, true ;                     setForeground fg.value, true ;                 }             }         ],         function    {             bg = document.querySelector 'bg-color' ;             fg = document.querySelector 'fg-color' ;             var bgcolor = taElement.style["background-color"];             var fgcolor = taElement.style["color"];             if  bgcolor && fgcolor  {  60      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info                   bg.value = rgb2hex bgcolor ;                 fg.value = rgb2hex fgcolor ;             }             else {                 bg.value = "ffffff";                 fg.value = "000000";             }             document.querySelector "setbackup" .addEventListener "click",               setBackup ;         }      ; }  The complicated call to  Dialogs.dialog is explained in detail in Appendix A, but, briefly, here’s how you would set up this dialog:    Supply HTML for the dialog, consisting of two color pickers, a button to set the  backup directory  in case we want to change it , and an OK button.    Supply an action for the OK button to call setBackground and setForeground to  set the colors from the color-picker values. Actions here also dismiss the dialog.    Supply an initialization function that sets the initial state of the color pickers to whatever the current text area styles are.  See “About rgb2hex” on page 61 for what that function does.  The function also sets the event handler for the Set Backup button,  which  is  the  identical  setBackup  function  that  you  can  see  in  “Adding Backup by Using Retained File Entries” on page 50.  Note that the action for the Set Backup button isn’t set in the action argument, where the OK button’s action is, because we don’t want the dialog dismissed when the backup is set.  About rgb2hex  When a color style is retrieved, it’s in the form rgb R,G,B , where the components span a range of 0–255. However, the color picker    element  requires that it be initialized using the form rrggbb, where the components are in hex. The function rgb2hex makes the conversion, as shown here:  function rgb2hex rgb  {     var components = rgb.match  ^rgb\  \d+ ,\s* \d+ ,\s* \d+ \ $  ;     function hex x  {         return  "0" + parseInt x .toString 16  .slice -2 ;     }     return "" + hex components[1]  + hex components[2]  + hex components[3] ; }  Local and Sync Storage      61  www.it-ebooks.info   Here are the two functions called when you click the OK button in the dialog:  function setBackground color, wantSave  {     if  color  {         document.querySelector "textarea" .style["background-color"] = color;         if  wantSave              setParams { background: color }, wantSync ;     } }  function setForeground color, wantSave  {     if  color  {         document.querySelector "textarea" .style["color"] = color;         if  wantSave              setParams { foreground: color }, wantSync ;     } }  The wantSync global is set to false, so we’ll be using local storage:  var wantSync = false;  Later, we’ll be using sync storage, and all we’ll have to do to get it is set the global to true. To use either storage area, you must request storage permission in the manifest.json file  see also Chapter 2 :  "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write",             "directory",             "retainEntries"         ]     },     "storage" ]  The setForeground and setBackground functions change the colors in the window immediately and also, if the second argument is true, set the colors in local storage. When the app is launched, we want to set the text area from whatever colors were saved in local storage:  getParams ["foreground", "background"],     function  items  {         if  chrome.runtime.lastError              console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ;         else {             setForeground items.foreground ;             setBackground items.background ;         }     },  62      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info       wantSync  ;  Observe how the first line passes an array of two keys to getParams and onto the get method. If the function succeeds, it sets the foreground and background from those colors. The second argument to setForeground and setBackground is omitted; there’s no need to set local storage, because that’s where the colors just came from. With  these  changes,  Simple  Editor  sets  its  colors  from  local  storage  when  it’s  first launched. If colors are changed via the Options dialog, they’re saved back into local storage.  Sync Storage Now, we’ll change Simple Editor to work with sync storage, instead of local storage. By doing so, all installations of the app by a user will share options. Conveniently, we need to change only one line: var wantSync = true;  If you review the code, you’ll see that only the colors are saved in sync storage, not the backup directory entry ID. Sync  storage  behaves  identically  to  local  storage,  except  that  Chrome  synchronizes changes to the storage if the app is installed on more than one computer. If you disable syncing in Chrome settings, however, the two storage areas operate identically. When a change is made to sync storage, that change is very quickly—within a second or two—reflected in the storage area accessed by every installation of the app. The next time the app is launched, it will retrieve the new colors. If you want to make the app more responsive by informing it when the colors are changed,  you  can  install  the  following  handler  for  the  chrome.storage.onChanged event:  chrome.storage.onChanged.addListener      function changes, areaName  {         if  areaName === "sync"  {             if  changes.foreground                  setForeground changes.foreground.newValue ;             if  changes.background                  setBackground changes.background.newValue ;         }     }  ;  Here,  we  care  only  about  changes  when  the  areaName  argument  to  the  callback  is sync.  Another possible value is local, which doesn’t apply to sync storage. A third value,  managed,  is  documented  but  doesn’t  appear  to  apply  to  Chrome  Apps.   The  Local and Sync Storage      63  www.it-ebooks.info   changes argument is an object indicating what changed. Each key is associated with an object with two properties: newValue, which is what we want, and oldValue, which does not concern us. To see the syncing, you need to install the app on two computers. Because the IDs need to be the same, it won’t do to move the source code over to the second computer and intall it with the “Load unpacked extension” button on the Extensions window. Instead, click the “Pack extension” button to create a .crx file and install that on both computers, guaranteeing that the ID will be the same. Or, upload the app to the Chrome Web Store and install it on both computers from there.  See “Publishing a Chrome App” on page 18.  Note that only the color options are synced, not the text being edited, which is what the syncing version of the Note app did in Chapter 1. Simple Editor edits files local to a computer.  Removing Items and Clearing Storage Two other APIs that you’ll sometimes need are remove, for removing a key from local or sync storage, and clear, for clearing all keys:  chrome.storage.local.remove x, callback  chrome.storage.sync.remove x, callback   chrome.storage.local.clear callback  chrome.storage.sync.clear callback   In the callbacks, chrome.runtime.lastError defined means there was an error. The argument to remove, like the argument to get, can be a key or an array of keys, but it cannot be null. IndexedDB As Table 2-1 in Chapter 2 indicates, IndexedDB is sandboxed, so any data you store there is imprisoned in a single app. You can’t do any of the common things that are done with a database, such as share it between apps or manage it with a database utility. Think of IndexedDB as being neither more nor less accessible than local files, over which its only advantage is that it stores indexed objects instead of flat data. It would be nice if there were both Local IndexedDB and External IndexedDB, as there are with files, but that’s not the case. Local is all you have. I’ll present two IndexedDB examples here:    Some simple code sequences to do basic things, such as creating a database, adding  objects, and retrieving an object.  64      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info     A  complete  app  that  maintains  a  mailing  list,  including  import  and  export  capabilities.  In this book, I cover maybe half of the IndexedDB API, but enough so you’ll get a thorough understanding of how to use it. You can read all the details at the entry for IndexedDB on the Mozilla Developer Network.  IndexedDB Objects and Method Chaining IndexedDB  is  implemented  in  terms  of  API  objects,  such  as  IDBFactory,  IDBData base, IDBObjectStore, IDBIndex, IDBCursor, and IDBTransaction. For example, to find an object by its key, you begin with an IDBDatabase, from which you get an IDB Transaction, from which you get an IDBObjectStore, from which you get an IDBIn dex whose get method gives you the object with that key. Fortunately, the IndexedDB API implements method chaining, so the code to find an object isn’t so bad:  db .transaction "mailing-list"  .objectStore "mailing-list"  .index "name-index"  .get "Jones"   Opening a Database You begin with indexedDB, which is an IDBFactory object from which you can request a particular version of a database. With conventional SQL databases, you execute so- called data manipulation language  DML  statements to create tables, indexes, views, and so on. IndexedDB has nothing like that, because any objects, with any keys, can be stored without advance notice. Still, when a database is first created or when its design changes, you’d like the chance to at least construct some indexes. The way IndexedDB handles this is to introduce the idea of an upgrade. If you request a version that doesn’t yet exist, the onupgradenee ded callback is called, giving you the chance to create needed objects. On subsequent requests for the same version, the upgrade callback isn’t called, and you’re just given access to the database. For example, here’s how to request a database and create an index called name-index when the database is new:  function openDatabase   {     var request = indexedDB.open "db1", 1 ;     request.onsuccess = function event  {         db = request.result;  IndexedDB      65  www.it-ebooks.info           db.onerror = errorHandler;         showMessage 'Database opened', true ;     };     request.onerror = errorHandler;     request.onupgradeneeded = function event  {         var db = event.target.result;         var store = db.createObjectStore "mailing-list", { autoIncrement: true } ;         store.createIndex "name-index", "last", { unique: false } ;     }; }  The database is named db1 and we’ve requested version 1. Because that doesn’t exist initially, the onupgradeneeded callback creates the object store and an index named name-index on the last key. If in the future the database is modified, perhaps by creating an  additional  index,  the  version  would  be  changed  to  2  and  the  onupgradeneeded callback would be changed as appropriate. If the version requested already exists, it’s just opened, without calling the onupgradeneeded callback. The showMessage and errorHandler functions are identical to what Simple Editor used  see “Local Files” on page 22 . In terms of conventional relational databases, you could think of an object store as a table, but it’s not at all tabular, because each object in it could have different keys  col‐ umns, in relational database terms . Each object in an object store represents a record, and I’ll often refer to an object stored in an IndexedDB database as a record. This is to distinguish it from all the other objects that JavaScript apps deal with.  Adding Objects in a Transaction IndexedDB operations such as adding or retrieving an object occur in a transaction, represented by an IDBTransaction object. As with relational database transactions, a transaction is atomic—done in its entirety or not at all. Transactions are also independ‐ ent, but inasmuch as IndexedDB databases are sandboxed and JavaScript is single- threaded, inconsistencies due to simultaneous updates aren’t much of a problem, unless you access the database from Web Workers, which can run concurrently. You get a transaction with the transaction method of an IDBDatabase object, like this, where we want a read write transaction:  Then, from an IDBTransaction, you can get a reference to the IDBObjectStore:  db .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"   db .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"  .objectStore "mailing-list"   Given an IDBObjectStore, you can call the add method to add an object:  66      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   Putting that all together, here’s code that adds three objects:  db .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"  .objectStore "mailing-list"  .add obj  .onsuccess = function  event  {        adding succeeded };  add {last: "Smith", first: "John"} ; add {last: "Jones", first: "Mary"} ; add {last: "Gonzalez", first: "Sharon"} ;  function add obj  {     db     .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"      .objectStore "mailing-list"      .add obj      .onsuccess = function  event  {         console.log 'added', obj ;     }; }  It’s important to understand that aside from the last property, which is what the index is based on  see the call to createIndex in the openDatabase function that appears in the preceding section , no other property of the object has been introduced to the da‐ tabase. Indeed, any object stored in an IndexedDB database can have any properties. This is very much unlike a relational database, in which all columns must be part of a table’s definition. You  can  see  these  objects  and  the  index  on  the  Resources  tab  in  Developer  Tools  Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6 .  Figure 3-5. IndexedDB objects shown in Developer Tools  IndexedDB      67  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-6. IndexedDB index shown in Developer Tools  Retrieving Objects by Using an Index To retrieve an object by key using an index, you call the index method of the IDBOb jectStore and then the get method of the IDBIndex:  db .transaction "mailing-list"  .objectStore "mailing-list"  .index "name-index"  .get "Jones"  .onsuccess = function  event  {     console.log "Found: ", event.target.result ; };  The console shows the following:  Found:  Object {last: "Jones", first: "Mary"}  Mailing List Example For a more elaborate example, Figure 3-7 shows an app that manages a mailing list. At the top is a text field and a button used to search for a record  an object in the database . Next come 2 navigation buttons, Prev and Next, used to browse the database. Then there are 3 buttons for clearing the form, deleting the record shown in the form, and saving any changes. In the middle is the form itself. Finally, at the bottom are 4 buttons for managing the database. These buttons—especially Delete Database—wouldn’t normally be available to all users, but they are here to simplify the example. At the bottom is a message area that, in this screenshot, shows that the database was updated. We’ll see exactly what each of the 10 buttons does as we go through the code.  68      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 3-7. The Mailing List app using IndexedDB  Handling Forms Here’s the index.html file that defines the user interface:                   IndexedDB                         Last:             Search             Prev       Next       Clear       Delete       Save                                           ,  IndexedDB      69  www.it-ebooks.info                                            Delete Database       Import...       Export...       Count       &nbsp;       Notice that an   tag is used for each field, although they’re not inside a   element. Because Chrome Apps can’t have any navigation, there’s nothing to be gained by using a form with a submit button, as is pointed out in “Chrome App Restrictions” on page 11. Getting data that the user types is handled in JavaScript with this function, which returns an object formed from the input fields:  function getForm   {     return {         last: document.querySelector "field-last" .value,         first: document.querySelector "field-first" .value,         street: document.querySelector "field-street" .value,         city: document.querySelector "field-city" .value,         state: document.querySelector "field-state" .value,         zip: document.querySelector "field-zip" .value,         email: document.querySelector "field-email" .value     }; }  There are two ways that data can populate the form:    Typed by the user as a new record   Retrieved from the database and perhaps modified by the user  When the user clicks the Save button, we have to know which case applies, because adding a new record and updating an existing record are different. That’s the purpose of the hidden field field-primaryKey at the bottom of the form. If a record is retrieved, it will hold the primary key  an integer . If the record is new, that field will be empty. To make this work, the function that populates the form must put the primary key there if one exists:  function fillForm object, primaryKey  {     if  !object          object = {};     if  !primaryKey          primaryKey = 0;     document.querySelector "field-last" .value = val object.last ;  70      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info       document.querySelector "field-first" .value = val object.first ;     document.querySelector "field-street" .value = val object.street ;     document.querySelector "field-city" .value = val object.city ;     document.querySelector "field-state" .value = val object.state ;     document.querySelector "field-zip" .value = val object.zip ;     document.querySelector "field-email" .value = val object.email ;     document.querySelector "field-primaryKey" .value = primaryKey; }  function val x  {     return x ? x : ""; }  When fillForm is called with no arguments, as it is when the form is to be cleared, we don’t want “undefined” to appear in the form, so the val function ensures that undefined properties show as as empty fields. We can see a call like that in the handler for the Clear button:  document.querySelector "clear" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         fillForm  ;     }  ;  Later, when we see the code for the Search button, we’ll see that the call is instead this:  fillForm cursor.value, cursor.primaryKey ;  Adding and Updating Records With the primary key in a hidden field in the form, if the record is modified, the app will know that it’s an update rather than an addition. We can see that in the code for the Save button’s handler:  document.querySelector "save" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         var store = db             .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"              .objectStore "mailing-list" ;         var object = getForm  ;         var key = document.querySelector "field-primaryKey" .value;         var primaryKey = key ? parseInt key  : 0;         if  primaryKey === 0  {             store             .add object              .onsuccess = function  event  {                 showMessage 'Added', true ;             };         }         else {             store             .put object, primaryKey   IndexedDB      71  www.it-ebooks.info               .onsuccess = function  event  {                 showMessage 'Updated', true ;             };         }     }  ;  The database has already been opened and the global db defined with the same openDa tabase function that we saw earlier. An object representing the data in the form is returned by the call to getForm. If the value of the field-primaryKey field is defined, primaryKey  is  nonzero;  otherwise,  the  record  is  new  and  it’s  zero.  The  call  to  par seInt ensures that primaryKey is an integer, not a string. If parseInt is zero, the add method of the IDBObjectStore in store is called to add a new object to the database. Otherwise, put is called to update an existing record, iden‐ tified by its primary key.  Deleting Records The handler for the Delete button uses the delete method of IDBObjectStore:  document.querySelector "delete" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         var primaryKey =           parseInt document.querySelector "field-primaryKey" .value ;         if  primaryKey > 0  {             db             .transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite"              .objectStore "mailing-list"              .delete primaryKey              .onsuccess = function  event  {                 fillForm  ;                 showMessage 'Deleted', true ;             };         }     }  ;  A user can delete a record showing in the form only if it was retrieved from the database, as indicated by the field-primaryKey field being nonzero. If it’s zero, no record was retrieved, so there’s nothing to delete.  An improvement would be to disable the Delete button when it’s ineffective.   Counting Records The Count button calls the IDBObjectStore method count to count the records:  document.querySelector "count" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         db  72      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info           .transaction "mailing-list"          .objectStore "mailing-list"          .count           .onsuccess = function  event  {             Dialogs.alert event.target.result + ' objects in database' ;         };     }  ;  If you click that button, you see the result in Figure 3-8.  Figure 3-8. Result from clicking the Count button  Searching and Ranges The Search button searches the database for the name the user typed in the Last field  id="search-key" . If there’s no exact match, it finds the next record in the index. This involves a couple of new things, cursors and ranges, which I’ll explain after you get a chance to look at the code:  document.querySelector "search" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         fillForm  ;         search document.querySelector "search-key" .value, "next", 0 ;     }  ;  function search key, dir, primaryKey  {     primaryKey = parseInt primaryKey ;     var range;  IndexedDB      73  www.it-ebooks.info       if  dir === "next"          range = IDBKeyRange.lowerBound key, false ;     else         range = IDBKeyRange.upperBound key, false ;     db     .transaction "mailing-list"      .objectStore "mailing-list"      .index "name-index"      .openCursor range, dir      .onsuccess = function  event  {         var cursor = event.target.result;         if  cursor  {             if  primaryKey > 0  {                 if  primaryKey === cursor.primaryKey                      primaryKey = 0;                 cursor.continue  ;             }             else {                 showMessage '' ;                 fillForm cursor.value, cursor.primaryKey ;             }         }         else             showMessage 'Not found' ;     }; }  Actually, the Prev and Next buttons also call search, but first we’ll consider the Search case, for which the first argument is the key to be searched, the second  dir  is next, and the third  primaryKey  is 0. The complication is what happens if the key isn’t found, in which case we want the next key. For example, this makes it possible for a search for “Br” to find the first name that starts with “Br”, perhaps “Brier.” To do that, instead of using the get method, which is what we saw in “Retrieving Objects by Using an Index” on page 68, we open a cursor on the IDBIndex object, which creates an IDBCursor object that’s delivered to its onsuccess callback. With a cursor, you can go through records sequentially. Initially, the onsuccess callback for openCursor has the cursor  in event.target.result  set to the first record in the supplied range. How‐ ever, if the continue method is called, the cursor moves to the next record in the range, and the onsuccess callback is called again. The cursor stays alive as long as you’re in that callback. As soon as it returns—by falling off the end in this case—the cursor goes away. However, for the Search button, primaryKey is 0, so continue isn’t called, and in the else clause the message is cleared and fillForm is called to display the retrieved record, which is that to which the cursor is pointing. If  cursor is undefined, the call to  openCursor found nothing in the range, and the message “Not found” is shown.  74      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   Now for an explanation of those ranges. The call to IDBKeyRange.lowerBound returns a range  an IDBKeyRange object  with a lower bound of key  what was typed in the search field . The second argument indicates whether the range should be open, which means that it excludes the key. Here, the key is included in the range so that an exact match will find the record with that last name. Similarly, IDBKeyRange.upperBound returns a range with an upper bound of key. Because the dir argument for the Search button is next, the range has an inclusive lower bound equal to the key. This means that the cursor that is opened begins there, with an exact match if there is one, and otherwise with the first record in the range. I’ve only explained the part of search that the Search button uses, skipping the pri maryKey > 0 case. For the Next button, we have that case:  document.querySelector "next" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         search document.querySelector "field-last" .value, "next",           document.querySelector "field-primaryKey" .value ;     }  ;  Observe that the first argument now is the last name from the form, not what was typed into the search field at the top of the window. Here the primaryKey argument to search is the one from the form’s hidden field, which has a nonzero value if that record was retrieved from the database. What the Next button should do is find the next record, not the one that’s in the form, and that’s what this code in the search function does:  if  primaryKey > 0  {     if  primaryKey === cursor.primaryKey          primaryKey = 0;     cursor.continue  ; }  If primaryKey !== cursor.primaryKey, the record found is not the one in the form, so we call continue to get the next record, and that goes on until we do find the record in the form. Then, we set primaryKey = 0 to stop after one more continue, taking the else case next time. How could it happen that the record found is not the one in the form, when the search range included the last name from the form? Easy: two records have the same last name. The search will find the first one in the index, which might not be the one in the form, so we have to loop until the cursor is positioned on the correct record. Then, the next one is the one we want. Handling the Prev button is similar, except the key is used to set the upper bound of the range, given that dir is not equal to next:  IndexedDB      75  www.it-ebooks.info   document.querySelector "prev" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         search document.querySelector "field-last" .value, "prev",           document.querySelector "field-primaryKey" .value ;     }  ;  Let’s recap how searching and navigation work:  1. The Search button finds the first record that matches what’s typed into the search  field, not necessarily an exact match.  2. The Next button finds the first record that’s after the one appearing in the form   with the primary key set .  3. The Prev button finds the record that precedes the one in the form.  Deleting a Database With most database applications, system-administrator operations such as deleting a database wouldn’t be performed by application programs; rather, they would be done using a database utility that only administrators have permission to use. However, be‐ cause IndexedDB databases are sandboxed, it isn’t possible to create a separate utility, not even as a Chrome App, because its app ID wouldn’t be the same as the one that owns the database. The same goes for importing and exporting the database: the app has to do it, or it can’t be done. That’s why the Delete Database, Import, and Export buttons are there, although in a real app they might be tucked away in a menu, not right there on the main window. They might be password-protected, too. But I’m in the Wild West  Colorado , so here’s the code to delete a database:  document.querySelector "delete_db" .addEventListener "click", deleteDatabase ;  function deleteDatabase   {     console.log 'd' ;     Dialogs.confirm 'Delete entire database?', 'Delete', 'Cancel',         function    {             fillForm  ;             if  db  {                 db.close  ;                 db = null;             }             var request = indexedDB.deleteDatabase "db1" ;             request.onsuccess = function   {                 openDatabase  ;             };             request.onerror = errorHandler;         }  76      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info        ; }  The existing IDBDatabase object in db isn’t used, because deleteDatabase is a method on the  IDBFactory object  indexedDB. After confirmation from the user, the form is cleared and the database is closed, just to be safe.  db.close is synchronous, so no callback is needed.  Then, deleteDatabase is called and, if it succeeds, the database is reopened so that the app can continue to be used. That is, the database is effectively cleared of data because a new one comes right back.  In your own IndexedDB app, you might want to do things differently.   Importing Data Again, importing is an operation that a separate database utility might do, if only such a thing were possible with IndexedDB in Chrome Apps. It works by opening an external file  see “External Files” on page 42  that contains data in JSON format, and then adding each record to the database. Here’s the part that reads the file:  document.querySelector "import" .addEventListener "click", importData ;  function importData   {     chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry          {             type: 'openFile'         },         function  entry  {             if  entry  {                 entry.file                      function  file  {                         var reader = new FileReader  ;                         reader.onloadend = function   {                             var objects = JSON.parse this.result ;                             loadData objects ;                             showMessage 'Opened OK', true ;                         };                         reader.readAsText file ;                     },                     errorHandler                  ;             }         }      ; }  The JSON objects to be imported are passed to the loadData function, which adds them using the same methods that we saw earlier for the Add button:  function loadData objects  {     var transaction = db.transaction "mailing-list", "readwrite" ;     transaction.oncomplete = function event  {  IndexedDB      77  www.it-ebooks.info           showMessage objects.length + ' objects imported', true ;     };     var store = transaction.objectStore "mailing-list" ;     for  var x of objects          store.add x ; }  Where does the JSON data to be imported come from? One place would be exported data, which comes in the next section. Or, you can get test data in JSON format from generatedata.com. It looks something like this:  [     {         "last": "Hart",         "first": "Nero",         "street": "467-6831 Aliquam Rd.",         "city": "Bridgeport",         "state": "CT",         "zip": "36575",         "email": "vulputate.nisi.sem@lectusconvallisest.co.uk"     },     {         "last": "Keller",         "first": "Simon",         "street": "477-1645 Gravida Rd.",         "city": "Kailua",         "state": "HI",         "zip": "48332",         "email": "ante.ipsum.primis@Nullafacilisi.org"     },     ... ]  To protect the innocent, this data is fake  as you probably guessed from those ridiculous email addresses .  Exporting Data Here’s the first part of the code for the Export button:  document.querySelector "export" .addEventListener "click", exportData ;  function exportData   {     chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry          {             type: 'saveFile'         },         function  entry  {             if  entry                  saveToEntry entry ;         }      ;  78      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   After a FileWriter is created and the file is truncated, the actual writing is done by the writeData function. We’ll use a cursor to cycle through all the records in the database and then use the write method of the FileWriter to write the record, like this:  }  function saveToEntry entry  {     entry.createWriter          function fileWriter  {             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;             fileWriter.onwrite = function   {                 writeData fileWriter ;             };             fileWriter.truncate 0 ;         },         errorHandler      ; }  function writeData fileWriter  {     var objects = [];     db     .transaction "mailing-list"      .objectStore "mailing-list"      .openCursor       .onsuccess = function  event  {         var cursor = event.target.result;         if  cursor  {             fileWriter.onwrite = function    {                 cursor.continue  ;    ouch!             };             fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;             fileWriter.write cursor.value ;         }         else             writeObjects fileWriter, objects ;     }; }  Because openCursor is called with no arguments, it begins with the first record in the index. The function looks straightforward enough, but it won’t work. Before I tell you why, you might want to pause here and see if you can figure it out for yourself. Give up? The problem is that, as I said earlier, the cursor is alive only within the onsuc cess callback, and execution stays there when the continue method is called. However, the call to write is asynchronous, so the onsuccess handler returns after it’s called, killing the cursor. In the onwrite callback the cursor is no longer defined. The JavaScript cursor variable is still defined, because of function closure; it’s just that the object it points to is no longer in working order.  IndexedDB      79  www.it-ebooks.info   This is a real screwup, for sure. The FileWriter APIs aren’t to blame. I think the fault lies with the way cursors are designed. But there’s nothing to be done about it, so the way to export with a cursor is to add all the records to a giant object representing the entire database and then, when the cursor is no longer needed, write the entire thing at once. That’s what this code does:  function writeData fileWriter  {     var objects = [];     db     .transaction "mailing-list"      .objectStore "mailing-list"      .openCursor       .onsuccess = function  event  {         var cursor = event.target.result;         if  cursor  {             objects.push cursor.value ;             cursor.continue  ;         }         else             writeObjects fileWriter, objects ;     }; }  function writeObjects fileWriter, objects  {     fileWriter.onwrite = function    {         showMessage objects.length + ' objects exported', true ;     };     fileWriter.onerror = errorHandler;     fileWriter.write new Blob [JSON.stringify objects ]  ; }  Because in this example the primary keys are integers, another way to export would be to retrieve the records one-by-one via the primary key, iterating from 1 until no more objects exist. It’s tricky to figure out what the maximum primary key is, because, as a result of deletions, it’s not the same as the object count. But, if you can get past that, it would be possible to write the records one-by-one, instead of accumulating thousands of them in a huge object. Chapter Summary In this chapter, we described the key-value-pair APIs: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB, which completes the list of storage methods introduced at the beginning of Chapter 2. The one remaining storage topic, media galleries, we’ll defer to Chapter 5.  80      Chapter 3: Local Storage, Sync Storage, and IndexedDB  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 4 Networking and Messaging  This chapter is mostly concerned with communication between Chrome App clients and servers on the Internet, using both APIs unique to Chrome Apps and APIs that are part of HTML5, such as WebSockets. I also discuss communication between windows in the same app as well as between apps on the same computer. We also explore notifi‐ cations that an app can pop up at the top of the screen to alert the user. The first section, which looks at the Socket API, is highly technical and perhaps not of interest to many readers, but it’s one of the most important Chrome APIs, so I cover it in detail. However, if you want to go directly to the APIs you’re likely to actually use, you can skip that section and start with “The XMLHttpRequest API” on page 94. Socket API The Internet communicates by using TCP IP, the initials of its two most important protocols: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. These were developed from research sponsored by the United States government that began in the 1960s. The TCP IP standard was eventually adopted by the Department of Defense in 1982. A year or so later, an API implementing TCP IP was released by the University of California in version 4.2BSD  Berkeley Software Distribution  of Unix, and that API came to be called BSD Sockets. It’s not much of an exaggeration to call BSD Sockets the API of the Internet. Nearly all web servers, browsers, email systems, FTP clients and servers, and everything else that talks to the Internet is based on BSD Sockets. That makes BSD Sockets probably the most important and universally implemented API there is. The BSD Sockets API is today the principal networking API on essentially all general- purpose operating systems, including Windows and Unix-like systems such as OS X and  Linux.  Other  platforms  built  on  Unix-like  systems,  such  as  iOS,  Android,  and Chrome  OS,  generally  wrap  the  BSD  Sockets  API  with  one  better  suited  to  their  www.it-ebooks.info  81   programming environment, and we’ll see the details of how Chrome does that later in this chapter.  How BSD Sockets Works Although the C-language BSD Sockets API isn’t used directly by Chrome Apps, it’s informative to sketch how it works. The first thing to note is that it’s synchronous, as were almost all of the Unix system calls at the time it was designed. A server creates a socket by using socket and then calls bind to bind it to a name that can be accessed by clients, such as api.openweathermap.org or 23.21.124.185. Then, it calls listen to indicate that it’s ready to accept connections from clients, and accept to wait until a client connects. The server’s thread that issued the accept is blocked  it’s synchronous  and can’t execute until an error occurs or somebody connects. The client calls socket to create a socket. It then calls connect to connect to a name that some server is listening on  e.g., api.openweathermap.org . While it’s waiting, the thread is blocked. When connect returns, the client has what in Unix is called a file descrip‐ tor, open for reading and writing on the socket, and it can use the conventional Unix- style read and write system calls to communicate with the server. On the server, when the client connects, the accept call returns with a file descriptor for the server’s use, open to another socket  not the one the server passed to accept , one just for that client. Then, the server must both service the client and issue another blocking accept. This requires tricky programming that I won’t go into, because it’s a Unix issue. The sockets API is only for connecting client and server; what they say to each other after they’re connected is up to them. In practice, various data protocols have been defined, such as HTTP  Hypertext Transfer Protocol  for the web, FTP  File Transfer Protocol ,  WebSockets,  or  one  of  the  email  protocols  such  as  SMTP   Simple  Mail Transfer Protocol  or IMAP  Internet Message Access Protocol . In an example that I’ll present shortly, we’ll see what HTTP data actually looks like.  Chrome Socket API For two reasons, the BSD Sockets API isn’t a good match for Chrome Apps: first, BSD Sockets is synchronous  accept and connect block until something happens , and sec‐ ond, it’s a C-language interface. Thus, the Chrome Socket API is a thin layer on top of BSD Sockets that’s designed specifically for JavaScript programs.  Don’t confuse the Chrome Socket API with HTML5 WebSockets, discussed in “WebSockets” on page 109.  There are three Chrome Socket APIs:    chrome.sockets.tcpServer for implementing servers.  82      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info     chrome.sockets.tcp for implementing clients.   chrome.sockets.udp, an alternative to TCP that uses packets instead of connec‐ tions. This is very rarely used compared to TCP, and therefore not discussed in this book.  Even though it’s strange to think of developing a server as a Chrome App, it’s possible, and it’s good to know that the APIs are there if you ever need them. More commonly, of course, Chrome Apps are cli‐ ents, so I’ll present just  chrome.sockets.tcp, and you can investi‐ gate the server APIs when and if you need them. Having said that, you’ll rarely even be using  chrome.sockets.tcp, because there are higher-level  APIs  that  are  much  easier  to  use,  such  as  XMLHttpRe quest and WebSockets, which I’ll get to later in this chapter.  To use the socket API, you need to add a socket section to the manifest.json file. It’s not a permission but a section in its own right where you specify the host and port to which you want to connect:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     ...     "sockets": {         "tcp": {             "connect": "api.openweathermap.org:80"         }     } }  A client starts by creating a socket:  chrome.sockets.tcp.create properties, callback   The properties are for unusual situations and normally can be empty. The callback is called when the socket is created; it’s passed a createInfo object with one important property,  socketId, which identifies the socket. For example, this code displays the socket ID 3 on the console:  chrome.sockets.tcp.create {},     function  createInfo  {         console.log createInfo.socketId ;     }  ;  After you create the socket, the next step is to connect to a host and port:  Socket API      83  www.it-ebooks.info   chrome.sockets.tcp.connect socketId, address, port, callback   If chrome.runtime.lastError is defined when the callback is called, an error occurred; otherwise, the client has connected:  chrome.sockets.tcp.create {},     function  createInfo  {         console.log createInfo.socketId ;         chrome.sockets.tcp.connect createInfo.socketId,             "api.openweathermap.org", 80,             function  result  {                 if  chrome.runtime.lastError                      console.log chrome.runtime.lastError.message ;                 else {                     console.log result ;                 }             }          ;     }  ;  There isn’t any interesting result, just a zero to indicate that all is well. After the connection is made, the client can send data to the server. Because api.open‐ weathermap.org is an HTTP server, you must talk to it in HTTP, which means sending a GET request, which looks something like this:  GET  data 2.1 find name?units=imperial&q=Chicago HTTP 1.1\r\n Host: api.openweathermap.org\r\n \r\n  Each line is terminated by a carriage return newline combination  denoted by \r\n , and the request must end with a blank line. The path and query string are defined by the folks at openweathermap.org in their API specification for using their weather map service, which we’ll be using for a few example apps. In JavaScript, you’d write the request like this:  var req = "GET  data 2.1 find name?units=imperial&q=Chicago HTTP 1.1\r\n" +   "Host: api.openweathermap.org\r\n\r\n";  But, you can’t just send a plain string—it must be a JavaScript ArrayBuffer. Using the relatively new TextEncoder API, here’s a function to do the conversion:  function str2ab str  {     var encoder = new TextEncoder 'utf-8' ;     return encoder.encode str .buffer; }  The reverse function, which we’ll need later, is the following:  function ab2str ab  {     var dataView = new DataView ab ;     var decoder = new TextDecoder 'utf-8' ;  84      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info       return decoder.decode dataView ; }  The  API  chrome.sockets.tcp.send  does  the  sending  after  the  connection  has been made:  chrome.sockets.tcp.send socketId, arrayBufferData, callback   Now, we can do a little HTTP by sending the GET request to api.openweathermap.org:  var req = "GET  data 2.1 find name?units=imperial&q=Chicago HTTP 1.1\r\n" +   "Host: api.openweathermap.org\r\n\r\n";  chrome.sockets.tcp.create {},     function  createInfo  {         console.log createInfo.socketId ;         chrome.sockets.tcp.connect createInfo.socketId,             "api.openweathermap.org", 80,             function  result  {                 if  chrome.runtime.lastError                      console.log chrome.runtime.lastError.message ;                 else {                     console.log result ;                     chrome.sockets.tcp.send createInfo.socketId,                         str2ab req ,                           function  sendInfo  {                               console.log sendInfo ;                           }                      ;                 }             }          ;     }  ;  The sendInfo on the console should display as {bytesSent: 42, resultCode: 0}. The request has been sent, but we didn’t set up a handler to receive anything back. We do that by using chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive.addListener, whose callback func‐ tion gets an info object with one property: data. It’s an ArrayBuffer, so we use ab2str to convert it to text:  chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive.addListener      function  info  {        if  info.data              console.log ab2str info.data  ;     }  ;  With the onReceive handler in place, we can rerun the sending code, and the entire HTML of the response—the weather in Chicago—appears on the console, as shown in Example 4-1.  Socket API      85  www.it-ebooks.info   Example 4-1. Response from GET request HTTP 1.1 200 OK Server: nginx Date: Wed, 19 Mar 2014 14:38:26 GMT Content-Type: text html Transfer-Encoding: chunked Connection: keep-alive X-Source: back  24d {"message":"","cod":"200","type":"base","calctime":"","units":"imperial"," count":1,"list":[{"id":4887398,"coord":{"lat":41.850029,"lon":-87.650047}, "name":"Chicago","main":{"temp":43.74,"pressure":1002,"humidity":93," temp_min":41,"temp_max":46.4},"dt":1395237126,"date":"2014-03-19 13:52:06","wind":{"speed":7.78,"deg":210,"gust":7.2},"clouds":{"all":90}," weather":[{"id":500,"main":"Rain","description":"light rain","icon":"10d"},{"id":701,"main":"Mist","description":"mist","icon":" 50d"}],"sys":{"country":"US","population":2695598},"url":"http:\ \  openweathermap.org\ city\ 4887398"}]}  0  The meat of the response is the JSON data we requested, which is easy to parse, and we’ll  soon  see  how  that’s  done  in  a  small  weather-report  application  that  accesses api.openweathermap.org.  Modules and Module Loading In the next section, I’m going to present code in the form of a module, so here’s a brief excursion to explain how I use modules in JavaScript. Generally, a module is a software component that implements functionality through a formally defined interface, the implementation of which is hidden inside the module. JavaScript, unlike almost all other languages, doesn’t have modules built in, but you can accomplish the same thing by defining an object with an exposed interface and internal functions and variables to implement that interface. As an example, a module defining socket functionality, in a file named socket.js, might look like this:  var Socket =  function    {     var module_var1 = 0;        ... more module variables ...      var api = {         HttpRequest: function    {         }     };      api.HttpRequest.prototype.method1 = function    {  86      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info              ...     };         ... more methods ...      return api;      function internal_function1   {            ...     }         ... more internal functions ...  }   ;  The global Socket is the module object, and its value is set by calling an anonymous function, so anything defined inside the function is local to it and invisible to the rest of the app. Note that the function definition is enclosed in parentheses, so as not to confuse the JavaScript parser, and then it’s immediately called, with the open and close parentheses on the very last line. The anonymous function returns a module object with one method, HttpRequest, that’s a constructor for a HttpRequest object. The module object is assigned to the Socket global  variable,  so  you  refer  to  the  constructor  as  Socket.HttpRequest.  The  Sock et.HttpRequest object has a public method,  method1, and a module-wide variable, module_var1, which is internal to the Socket module, but visible to everything inside the module. You use the Socket.HttpRequest object like this:  var skt = new Socket.HttpRequest  ; skt.method1  ;  The socket.js file is only one of several utility objects we’ll be defining, and it’s a nuisance to keep adding script tags to the HTML file—made especially tricky because some will refer to others, so the order of inclusion matters. I like to include just one file, com‐ mon.html, and have it load the other JavaScript files:           Now, I can list the modules I commonly use in one file.  We’ll see Facebook.js later in this chapter.  All of the modules are in a lib subdirectory, so most of the index.html files in the examples from now on will have one   tag  for common.html, if needed, and one   tag for the app code :         Socket API      87  www.it-ebooks.info              WeatherReport                   ...  I’ll be following this scheme for all of the modules that I present in this book. It’s probably the simplest approach that provides the essentials without getting too complicated; thus, our focus can stay on Chrome Apps. If you want something more feature-rich, you can read about the Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD  API at github.com amdjs  amdjs-api. AMD and dynamic loading are supported by RequireJS, which works well with Chrome Apps.  Wrapping the Socket API as an Object in a Module Our socket example works, but it’s an awkward way to use sockets. The API calls aren’t especially hard to code, but they’re tedious to write, and doing all those string conver‐ sions is annoying. What we want are some simple wrapper functions that we can use any time we need to use sockets for HTTP requests. It’s most convenient if all of the code for these functions is placed in a single JavaScript file that defines a module. We’ll implement the object Socket.HttpRequest as such a module, basing it on the chrome.sockets.tcp example code that we already have. We don’t normally think of a URL as a host plus a path; rather, we consider it one continuous string, so we’d like the Socket.HttpRequest object to parse it for us by using a method that we’ll call open, like this: var skt = new Socket.HttpRequest  ; skt.open "get",   "http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.1 find name" +   "?units=imperial&cnt=2&q=Chicago" ;  I’ve formed the URL from two concatenated strings so that the code fits on this page. The first argument says that GET should be used, in case we want to implement POST requests, too, at some point. Here’s the code for open:  var Socket =  function    {  var api = {     HttpRequest: function    {     } };  api.HttpRequest.prototype.open = function  method, url  {     var a = url.match  ^http:\ \  [^ ]*  .* $  ;     this.host = a[1];     this.path = a[2];  88      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info       this.req = "GET " + this.path + " HTTP 1.1\r\nHost: " +       this.host + "\r\n\r\n"; };  return api; }   ;  This method adds several object properties  for example, this.host  to the object, for use later. Before  we’re  ready  to  go  further,  there’s  a  problem:  the  chrome.sockets.tcp.onRe ceive handler is global and is called for data received on any socket. However, we’ll want to associate a receive callback with a specific Socket.HttpRequest instance, so the single handler will have to know what callback to call. We do that by using a global  to the module  array of Socket.HttpRequest instances, indexed by socket ID:  var activeSockets = [];  When a socket is created, the object reference is stored in activeSockets, and then the handler has a way to find out which object belongs to that socket. We can see this in the code for the send method, which is almost identical to the earlier example, except that some of the literals have been replaced by object properties:  api.HttpRequest.prototype.send = function    {     var that = this;     chrome.sockets.tcp.create {},         function  createInfo  {             activeSockets[createInfo.socketId] = that;             chrome.sockets.tcp.connect createInfo.socketId, that.host, 80,                 function  result  {                     if  chrome.runtime.lastError  {                         if  that.onerror                              that.onerror chrome.runtime.lastError.message ;                     }                     else {                         chrome.sockets.tcp.send createInfo.socketId,                           str2ab that.req ,                             function  sendInfo  {                             }                          ;                     }                 }              ;         }      ; }  A well-known JavaScript trap is that local functions  such as the callback in this example  have this set to themselves, rather than to the outer object. Consider this line:  chrome.sockets.tcp.connect createInfo.socketId, that.host, 80,  Socket API      89  www.it-ebooks.info   If the code had used this.host, it would have been undefined because this would refer to  the  callback  passed  to  chrome.sockets.tcp.create,  not  to  the  Socket.HttpRe quest instance. The fix is to define a that variable local to the method and refer to it, as shown in the code. If an error occurs, a onerror callback is called if it’s defined, as it might be like this:  skt.onerror = function  msg  {        display the msg };  To send the request, all we have to do is add a call to send to what we had before:  var skt = new Socket.HttpRequest  ; skt.open "get",   "http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.1 find name" +   "?units=imperial&cnt=2&q=Chicago" ; skt.send  ;  Now, we’re ready for the chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive handler, which can use the activeSockets array to figure out to which object the socket ID belongs:  chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive.addListener      function  info  {         var req = activeSockets[info.socketId];         if  req  {             if  info.data                  req.receiveData ab2str info.data  ;             else                 req.receiveData  ;         }     }  ;  Recall from Example 4-1 that the data comes back in the form of an HTTP header followed by some JSON  if the request succeeded . The format of the response follows this  pattern,  assuming  chunking   splitting  the  response  into  pieces ,  which  is  how openweathermap.org delivers it:  HTTP 1.1   OK ...       0  Finding the status and, if it’s 200  the HTTP success code , extracting the JSON, is the job of the receiveData method. I’ve written it only for a single chunk; if you want, you can extend it for multiple chunks and for unchunked responses. Here’s the code:  90      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   api.HttpRequest.prototype.receiveData = function  s  {     var a = s.split "\r\n" ;     var msg;     if  a.length > 0  {         if  a[0].indexOf "HTTP 1.1 "  == 0              this.statusText = a[0].substr 9 ;         else             this.statusText = a[0];         this.status = parseInt this.statusText ;     }     else {         this.status = 0;         this.statusText = null;     }     if  this.status == 200  {         var a = s.split "\r\n\r\n" ;         var n = a[1].indexOf "{" ;         var len = parseInt a[1], 16 ;         this.response = a[1].substr n, len ;     }     else         this.response = null;     if  this.onload          this.onload  ; }  The app can set a callback like the following to receive the response:  skt.onload = function    {        data was received }  Finally, there’s an error callback, using chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceiveError.addLis tener, which I didn’t show earlier. It also uses the activeSockets array to find the object:  chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceiveError.addListener      function  info  {         var req = activeSockets[info.socketId];         if  req && req.onerror              req.onerror "Result Code: " + info.resultCode ;     }  ;  Although Socket.HttpRequest is only for HTTP, its HTTP-ness resides in the form of data sent and how received data is interpreted. All of the socket plumbing is universal and can work for any Internet protocol.  A Weather Report App In this section, we’re going to use Socket.HttpRequest to implement a simple weather report app, which you can see in Figure 4-1. When you type a city and click the Get Weather button, a report displays, as shown in Figure 4-2.  Socket API      91  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-1. The initial Weather Report window  Figure 4-2. A weather report for Chicago  The index.html file is pretty simple  note the link and script elements :                   WeatherReport                  92      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   The app’s JavaScript file, WeatherReport.js, begins with the usual onload handler:         City:             Get Weather            <textarea id="textarea" cols="60" rows="20" readonly       style='outline: none;'>                    window.onload = function    {  var skt = new Socket.HttpRequest  ;  document.querySelector "get" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         getWeather document.querySelector "city" .value ;     }  ;  };  function getWeather city  {     var textarea = document.querySelector "textarea" ;     textarea.value = "Wait...";      skt.onload = function    {         if  skt.status === 200  {             var obj = JSON.parse skt.response ;             showMessage obj.message, true ;             textarea.value = formatWeather obj ;         }         else             showMessage "Error: " + skt.status ;     }  When the button is clicked, getWeather is called. It uses Socket.HttpRequest, just as we’ve seen in the examples earlier:      skt.onerror = function  msg  {         showMessage msg ;     };     skt.open "get", "http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.1 find name" +       "?units=imperial&cnt=2&q=" + city ;     skt.send  ; }  The showMessage function is the same one we used in Chapters 2 and 3. Because the JSON response has already been extracted if the status is 200, it’s easy to convert it to a  Socket API      93  www.it-ebooks.info   JavaScript  object  by  using  the  call  to  JSON.parse.  Sometimes,  the  openweather map.org API provides a message property, which is displayed. Then, the report object is passed on to formatWeather for formatting:  function formatWeather value  {     if  !value.list  value.list.count == 0          return "No cities found";     var s = "";     for  var x of value.list  {         s += x.name;         if  x.sys.country              s += ", " + x.sys.country;         s += "\n";         s += "Lat: " + x.coord.lat + ", Lon: " + x.coord.lon + "\n";         s += "Date: " + x.date + "\n";         for  var d of x.weather              s += d.description + "\n";         if  x.main              for  var k in x.main                  s += k + ": " + x.main[k] + "\n";         if  x.wind              for  var k in x.wind                  s += "Wind " + k + ": " + x.wind[k] + "\n";         if  x.rain              s += "Rain today: " + x.rain.today + "\n";         s += "----------------------\n";     }     return s; }  There’s no methodology that you can use to construct functions like formatWeather, because every API I’ve used formats its results differently. You just keep horsing around until you’ve got something you like, which is what I did. You’ll find it helpful to dump out the object with console.log so that you can explore its properties. The XMLHttpRequest API There might have been something familiar to you about Socket.HttpRequest: it’s a lot like XMLHttpRequest, which is built in to Chrome and most other browsers. Actually, Socket.HttpRequest is modeled on XMLHttpRequest exactly, both to provide an ex‐ ample  of  how  you  use  sockets,  and  to  provide  an  in-depth  explanation  of  what XMLHttpRequest actually does under the covers. Incidentally, although XMLHttpRequest is at the heart of the Ajax technique, which is widely used for dynamic websites, it has little to do with XML and, in fact, is just as often used with JSON, as we did.  94      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   The name Ajax started out life presented in all uppercase  AJAX  and until not long ago was actually an acronym that stood for Asynchro‐ nous JavaScript and XML. Today, the convention is to consider it just a name, spelled “Ajax.”  I had a surprise in store all along: you can change the Weather Report example to use XMLHttpRequest by changing the following single line of code:  var skt = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  You also need to add any URLs you access as permissions to the manifest.json file, not in the socket section that was required for chrome.sockets.tcp, but as actual permis‐ sions, like this:  "permissions": [     "http:  api.openweathermap.org *" ],  If you don’t want to enumerate every URL in the permissions section, you can arrange for the app to access any and all URLs:  "permissions": [     " " ]  With these minor changes, the app behaves exactly as before, but now using the built- in XMLHttpRequest API instead of one based on chrome.sockets.tcp. For HTTP, you’re definitely better off with XMLHttpRequest as opposed to doing the same thing with sockets, but XMLHttpRequest is only for HTTP and HTTPS requests. You’ll go to sockets when you need to implement a nonstandard protocol, as might be used by specialized devices such as drones or programmable ball machines. It’s convenient to put a wrapper around XMLHttpRequest. This makes it even easier to use and was inspired by the popular Ajax function in jQuery, but with a very different interface. Here it is as a module in the file Ajax.js:  var Ajax =  function    {     var api = {         ajaxSend: function  url, responseType, successCallback, errorCallback,           headers  {             var req = new XMLHttpRequest  ;             req.onload = function  e  {                 successCallback req.status, req.response ;             };             req.onerror = errorCallback;             req.responseType = responseType ? responseType : "text";             req.open "get", url ;             if  headers                  for  var v in headers   The XMLHttpRequest API      95  www.it-ebooks.info                       req.setRequestHeader v, headers[v] ;             req.send  ;         }     };     return api; }   ;  One feature of XMLHttpRequest that we haven’t used but that is implemented by the Ajax object, is a fifth argument to ajaxSend that provides headers to be added to the request. We’ll need that feature later, in “Accessing Google APIs” on page 106. To see how to use the Ajax object, here’s a rewrite of getWeather from the Weather Report app we developed earlier: function getWeather city  {     var textarea = document.querySelector "textarea" ;     textarea.value = "Wait...";      Ajax.ajaxSend "http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.1 find name" +       "?units=imperial&cnt=2&q=" + city, "json",         function  status, obj  {             if  status === 200  {                 showMessage obj.message, true ;                 textarea.value = formatWeather obj ;             }             else                 showMessage "Error: " + status ;         },         function  e  {             showMessage "Communication error" ;             console.log 'Communication error:', e ;         }      ; }  We’ll  see  more  uses  of  the  Ajax  module  later  in  this  chapter  when  we  use  the chrome.identity API to access Facebook. Identity API Anybody can access api.openweathermap.org, but when you access nonpublic resources on sites such as Facebook, you must log in. In the past, apps did this by requesting a login name and password from the user and then storing that so it could be used with whatever login API the website provided. This created a few problems:  96      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info     It isn’t safe to have logins and passwords stored in various places, because there’s  no guarantee that they’re sufficiently protected.    There’s  no  way  to  revoke  permission  for  the  app  to  access  the  site,  other  than changing the password.  Deleting the app from your computer isn’t an option if it’s actually a website.     Permissions are all-or-nothing. There’s no way to provide permission to access the site but not update it; when the app is logged in, it has all the privileges of a user.  A few years ago an API called OAuth became widely available. With OAuth, you don’t provide your login and password to an app that needs to log in; rather, the app contacts the website you’re trying to access  for example, Facebook  and requests the permissions it needs. You then get an authorization request from the website, not from the app. If you grant permission, the website provides a token to the app that it can use to access APIs. You can go to the website and revoke permission at any time, causing the token to become invalid. The important part is that the app never sees your login or password. The first version of OAuth was complicated to use, but OAuth2 is much more straight‐ forward.  It’s  especially  easy  for  Chrome  Apps  because  there’s  a  chrome.identi ty.launchWebAuthFlow API that does all the work for you:  chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow details, callback   The details include the OAuth2 URL provided by the website and a few other options, as we’ll see shortly. You need identity permission in the manifest.json file as well as permission for any URLs you need to access. Here’s the easiest way to do this:  "permissions": [     "identity",     " " ]  Accessing the Facebook API When the  chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow call is made, the user sees a login form from the website, similar to the one in Figure 4-3. Then, after successfully logging in, the user sees an authorization form  Figure 4-4  listing just the permissions requested by the app. If the user authorizes the app, chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow calls its callback function and provides the app with an access token. If the user had already authorized the app in a previous launch, chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow will provide the access token without any dialogs, in effect keeping the user “logged in.”  Identity API      97  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-3. The Facebook login window  Figure 4-4. A Facebook authorization window  At any time, the user can go to the website to revoke permission for the app, as shown in Figure 4-5 for Facebook.  98      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-5. Revoking an app’s Facebook authorization  What makes OAuth2 challenging to use isn’t the interaction with the website—which is automated by the Chrome API—but figuring out what URL to pass to chrome.iden tity.launchWebAuthFlow. You’ll need to study the website’s developer documentation in depth; here, I’ll show the details for Facebook, but, unfortunately, you’ll find that every website does it differently. Facebook uses a URL similar to the following  broken into several lines for readability :  https:  www.facebook.com dialog oauth ?client_id=  &response_type=token &redirect_uri=  &scope=   The  , a 15-digit number, is provided by Facebook when the app is registered by the developer—yet another step that’s done differently for every website, although Facebook makes it fairly easy.  Log in to Facebook and find the Create App page; doing it for apps that want to use Google APIs is described in Appendix B.  The   is what Facebook accesses when the OAuth2 process is completed. For Chrome Apps, there’s an API for getting it: chrome.identity.getRedirectURL. The   is the list of permissions you want authorized, which is documented on the website’s developer pages. For our Facebook example, we just need user_photos. We’ll put the call to chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow in an authorize method of a Facebook object defined in lib Facebook.js:  var Facebook =  function    {     var access_token = null;     var api = {         authorize: function  clientID, scope, callback  {             access_token = null;  Identity API      99  www.it-ebooks.info               chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow                  {                     url: "https:  www.facebook.com dialog oauth?client_id=" +                       clientID + "&response_type=token&" +                       "redirect_uri=" + chrome.identity.getRedirectURL   + "&" +                       "scope=" + scope,                     interactive: true                 },                 function  responseURL  {                     console.log responseURL ;                     if  responseURL  {                         var a = responseURL.match  access_token= [^&]* &  ;                         if  a.length > 0                              access_token = a[1];                         callback true ;                     }                     else                         callback false ;                 }              ;         }     };     return api; }   ;  In the first argument  detail  to chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow, the interac tive property is set to true so we get the login authorization interaction that we saw earlier, which is required for Facebook and most other websites that use OAuth2. If authorization succeeds, responseURL is a string containing various parameters, so that we use a regular expression to extract the access_token, which we store in a module variable. Then, we call the app’s callback by specifying true, indicating that the app can proceed to execute various Facebook APIs, which I’ll show shortly. I’ll show the app that uses the Facebook object soon, but for now here’s the part that calls Facebook.authorize  the client ID is bogus : Facebook.authorize '123...345', 'user_photos',     function    {         getPhotos  ;     }  ;  The function getPhotos, which we’ll see when we see the app, displays the Facebook photos.  100      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Accessing Websites via OAuth Version 1  Many websites have moved to OAuth2, but there are some holdouts, such as Flickr. You can use chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow for part of the authorization, but you still have a lot of work to do with some complicated XMLHttpRequest calls that you need to build up yourself. I don’t want to go into the gruesome details here, because they’re not unique to Chrome Apps, but I did make them available in a Flickr example app that you can find in the online example code for this book.  There’s one more method to look at: Facebook.call, which makes Facebook API calls after an app is authorized. Again, every website is different, so you need to study the developer documentation to find out how the API works. This isn’t a book about ac‐ cessing Facebook, so I’ll just explain the one call we’ll use  there are dozens of them :  https:  graph.facebook.com me photos uploaded?access_token=   Facebook uses what it calls a Graph API, which works like this: we start with me  the logged-in user , navigate to the user’s photos, and then to the uploaded photos. Each API call returns its results differently, but always as a JSON-formatted object that you must explore to find what you want, although Facebook does document the subobjects and their properties. For photos, it’s easy: the returned object is an array of Photo objects, each of which has properties such as source, the URL of the photo, width, and height. We’ll use those properties in the app. With that introduction, here’s the Facebook.call method from lib Facebook.js:          call: function  method, successCallback, errorCallback  {             var url = 'https:  graph.facebook.com ' + method;             if  method.indexOf '?'  === -1                  url += '?';             else                 url += '&';             url += 'access_token=' + access_token;             Ajax.ajaxSend url, "json",                 function  status, response  {                     if  response.error  {                         var err = response.error;                         if  response.error.message                              err = response.error.message;                         if  errorCallback                              errorCallback response.error.message ;                     }                     else                         successCallback response ;  Identity API      101  www.it-ebooks.info                   }              ;         }  In building up the URL, we need to precede the access_token parameter with & if the method itself had a ?, which some do; otherwise, we use a ?. We send the query with Ajax.ajaxSend  see “The XMLHttpRequest API” on page 94 .  A Facebook Photos App With the Facebook object in hand, let’s build a little app to show Facebook photos  mine , as presented in Figure 4-6.  Figure 4-6. The Facebook photos app  This simple app doesn’t have any buttons or any options; when you launch it, it gets authorization  if isn’t already authorized , gets a list of photos, and displays them in the window. The index.html file is pretty simple, consisting mostly of CSS to make the content div fill the entire window and to display “Wait…” while the photos are being fetched.                   FBphotos         102      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info                        body, html {             height: 100%;             margin: 0;         }         content {             overflow-y: scroll;             height: 100%;             position: relative;             background-color: black;         }         wait {             margin: 100px 100px;             color: white;             font-size: 30px;         }                 Wait...        window.onload = function    {  Facebook.authorize '123...345', 'user_photos',     function    {         getPhotos  ;     }  ; window.onresize = layoutPhotos;     ... rest of app  };  As usual, the app file, FBphotos.js, puts all of the code in the onload handler to ensure that the HTML is processed and all the modules are loaded:  Laying out the photos in the window is the job of  layoutPhotos, which is also the handler for onresize events. As I mentioned earlier, getPhotos executes the Facebook API call to retrieve the URLs of the uploaded photos, an example of which is shown here:  https:  scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net hphotos-ash3 t1.0-9 s720x720  48007_10200417185706189_1210761502_n.jpg  Because of a Chrome App restriction, you can’t just set this URL as the src attribute of an   element and add it to the HTML, a technique that would work just fine in a web page. Instead, you must access the image’s URL via HTTP and get the binary data  Identity API      103  www.it-ebooks.info   coming back  compressed JPEG data  as a  Blob, form it into a very long URL that contains the literal Blob data, and then use that self-contained URL in the   element. It’s convenient to code a method to do that conversion in a Photo object, in the file Photo.js:  var Photo =  function    {     var api = {         getBlobUri: function url, callback  {             Ajax.ajaxSend url, "blob",                 function  status, response  {                     callback URL.createObjectURL response  ;                 }              ;         }     };     return api; }   ;  The creation of the Blob-containing URL is done by URL.createObjectURL, which is built into Chrome. With the Photo.getBlobUri method, we’re ready to look at getPhotos:  var photos;  function getPhotos   {     Facebook.call ' me photos uploaded',         function  response  {             photos = response.data;             var blobCount = 0;             photos.forEach                  function  photo  {                     Photo.getBlobUri photo.source,                         function  blob_uri  {                             photo.blob_uri = blob_uri;                             if  ++blobCount === photos.length                                  layoutPhotos  ;                         }                      ;                 }              ;         }      ; }  The Photo.getBlobUri callback has only three lines of code, but they’re tricky:    The returned URI is added to the Photo object. That’s a little adventurous because the object was supplied by Facebook, but there’s not much chance that Facebook will ever have a property called blob_uri.  104      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info     Like most things worth doing, Photo.getBlobUri is asynchronous, and we don’t want to lay out and display the photos until we’ve converted all the source URLs. So, we keep a count of how many were converted and call layoutPhotos only when they’re all done.  One way or another—because the photos were just downloaded or because the window was resized—layoutPhotos lays out and displays the photos:  function layoutPhotos   {     var gap = 5;     var div = document.querySelector 'content' ;     while  div.firstChild          div.removeChild div.firstChild ;     var totalHeight = layout photos, div.clientWidth, div.clientHeight   4, gap ;     var img;     photos.forEach          function  photo  {             img = new Image  ;             img.src = photo.blob_uri;             img.style['max-width'] = photo.xWidth + 'px';             img.style['max-height'] = photo.xHeight + 'px';             img.style['left'] = photo.xLeft + 'px';             img.style['top'] = photo.xTop + 'px';             img.style['position'] = 'absolute';             div.appendChild img ;         }      ;     img.style['margin-bottom'] = gap + 'px';    gap at bottom of whole div }  function layout photos, targetWidth, targetHeight, gap  {     var x = gap;     var y = gap;     photos.forEach          function  photo  {             photo.xHeight = targetHeight;             photo.xWidth = photo.width * targetHeight   photo.height;             var cellWidth = photo.xWidth + 5;             if  x + cellWidth > targetWidth  {                 x = gap;                 y += targetHeight + gap;             }             photo.xLeft = x;             photo.xTop = y;             x += cellWidth;         }      ; }  The layout function determines where each photo goes with a very simple scheme not unlike how a word processor fills lines with ragged-right text. You can see the results in  Identity API      105  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 4-6. These two functions don’t do anything particularly related to Chrome Apps, so I won’t go through them line by line. All they do is take the dimensions of each photo to figure out where it goes and then construct a corresponding   element, which is then appended to the HTML. I won’t show the code here, but there’s a much more sophisticated layout algorithm in the Photo object  Photos.js  that you can find in the online example code for this book.  Accessing Google APIs Like Facebook and many other sites, Google requires that an app be registered to get a client ID before it can use any APIs. The steps for getting a client ID through Google are enumerated in Appendix B. Google  uses  OAuth2,  but  Google,  used  in  place  of  chrome.identity.getAuthToken:  chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow,   special  authorization  API   for called  there’s  a   just   chrome.identity.getAuthToken details, callback   The details are the same as for chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow: an object with the interactive property, which you’ll usually set to true. The callback function gets the access token directly, so you don’t have to extract it from a response URL, as we did earlier in the FBphotos example. If the token argument is undefined, an error occurred. Instead of passing the client ID and scope directly to the OAuth2 call as URL parameters, chrome.identity.getAuthToken takes them from the manifest:  "permissions": [     "identity" ], "key": "MIIBIjANB...yyltEwIDAQAB", "oauth2": {     "client_id": "2546277...3kj.apps.googleusercontent.com",     "scopes": [         "https:  www.googleapis.com auth drive"     ] }  The various scopes are documented along with the particular API you’re using. Ap‐ pendix B explains how to get the client ID and how to include a key property in the manifest so that the app ID remains fixed, because having it change during development is awkward and prone to error. After  is  authorized  by  chrome.identity.getAuthToken,  you  can issue  calls  specified  by  the  API  you  want  to  use.  There  are  dozens  of  them  at developers.google.com apis-explorer.  the  app   106      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   As a simple example, the GDrive app shown in Figure 4-7 lists files on your Google Drive.  Figure 4-7. Files on my Google Drive  The index.html file is similar to ones we’ve been using in other examples:                   GDrive                       <textarea id="textarea" cols="55" rows="20" readonly       style='outline: none;'>       An object in Google.js wraps the calls needed to access Google APIs, very similar to Facebook.js that we saw in “Accessing the Facebook API” on page 97:  var Google =  function    {     var access_token;      var api = {         authorize: function  callback  {             chrome.identity.getAuthToken                  {  Identity API      107  www.it-ebooks.info                       'interactive': true                 },                 function token  {                     access_token = token;                     callback token !== undefined ;                 }              ;         },          call: function  method, successCallback, errorCallback  {             var url = 'https:  www.googleapis.com ' + method;             Ajax.ajaxSend url, "json",                 function  status, response  {                     if  response && response.error && response.error.message                          errorCallback response.error.message ;                     else if  status == 200                          successCallback response ;                     else                         errorCallback 'Result code: ' + status ;                 },                 function  e  {                     if  errorCallback                          errorCallback 'Communication error' ;                 },                 {                     Authorization: 'Bearer ' + access_token                 }              ;         }     };     return api; }   ;  Google API calls generally have the form  https:  www.googleapis.com  , where   is the method  e.g., drive v2 files . Note in the call method that we send the access token along as an Authorization header, which is a bit more con‐ venient than supplying it as a URL query parameter. That uses the fifth argument to Ajax.ajaxSend that I mentioned earlier. The entire GDrive app code is surprisingly compact:  window.onload = function    {  Google.authorize      function    {         var ta = document.querySelector 'textarea' ;         ta.value = 'Wait ...';         Google.call 'drive v2 files?q=trashed%3dfalse',             function  response  {                 var s = '';                 response.items.forEach                      function  file  {  108      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info                           s += file.modifiedDate + '  ' + file.title + '\n';                     }                  ;                 ta.value = s;             },             function  msg  {                 ta.value = 'Error: ' + msg;             }          ;     }  ;  };  Notice the method string:  drive v2 files?q=trashed%3dfalse  The trashed=false parameter value is written with the equals sign escaped as %3d. This is because it’s the value of the q parameter, not a top-level query parameter in its own right. As GDrive illustrates, using Google APIs from Chrome Apps is much like using any other API, except for the special, Google-only, OAuth2 authorization. WebSockets HTTP was originally designed as a way for web browsers to fetch web pages. It has since been coopted for use by web APIs, as we’ve seen. Parameters describing the request are specified by paths and query parameters  or by POST data , and the requested data must be extracted from the response. This approach, though very widely used, is inefficient for two reasons:    Supplying all those headers with every request and response slows down commu‐  nication and requires extra processing.    All interaction must be initiated from the client.  The second issue is occasionally worked around by having the client issue a long-term request, which the server responds to when it has something to say, possibly minutes or even hours after the request was issued. This can become complicated if the client wants to do some other communication in the interim or if the long-term request times out; in both cases, the request must be reissued. Much better would be to use a symmetrical protocol by which either client or server can send a message and the overhead of all those headers is eliminated. That’s what WebSockets  part of the HTML5 effort  are all about. They’re not specific to Chrome Apps, but they do work well with them.  WebSockets      109  www.it-ebooks.info   WebSockets API Using WebSockets is considerably easier than using XMLHttpRequest. First, the client creates a connection to the server with the constructor, like this:  var ws = new WebSocket 'ws:  23.21.124.185:5002' ;  The special ws protocol indicates that the connection is to a WebSocket. After the object is instantiated, a message can be sent by using send:  ws.send data ;  The data can be a string, an ArrayBuffer, or a Blob. A message is received with an onmessage handler:  ws.onmessage = function  event  {     if  event.data  {            do something with data     }     else            no data was received };  Those are the basics. There is one additional API call, close, and a few additional events such as onopen, but not many—WebSockets really is very simple. WebSockets is only a client API; there is no corresponding server API. To build a server, you need to follow Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  document RFC6455, which defines the WebSocket Protocol in terms of the raw data being transmitted on the sock‐ ets.  Recall from “Socket API” on page 81 that I characterized sockets as the underlying API of the Internet.   Example WebSocket Server There is a Chrome API for server-side sockets  chrome.sockets.tcpServer , so it’s possible to implement a WebSocket server as a Chrome App. But, WebSocket servers are normally built by using server technologies. Because implementing a WebSocket server is a distraction from our focus on Chrome Apps, I won’t describe the example one I’ve built in detail, but I’ve included it in the example code for this book. It accesses the New York City MTA  Metropolitan Transportation Authority  Bus Time service to provide a WebSocket interface that supplies bus status. The example server is implemented with Node.js, for which there’s a good WebSocket library. I ran the server on an Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud  EC2  instance that is accessible  when I’m running it  at IP address 23.21.124.185, port 5002.  Sorry, it’s not available to you, although its source code and the MTA Bus Time server are.   110      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Example WebSocket Client After you connect to the example server, it begins sending status-update messages every minute. The messages contain information about buses on the M4 line  what stop they’re approaching, whether they’re making progress, and so on , which runs between Penn Station and The Cloisters, about as far north as Manhattan goes. Figure 4-8 shows a typical status display in the app, called NYCBusWS, where, for example, bus 3840 is ap‐ proaching 101 Street making normal progress. Figure 4-9 shows that it’s reached that stop a short time later.  Figure 4-8. Updated status of buses on the M4 route  Here’s the index.html file:                   NYCBusWS                             body, html {             height: 100%;             width: 100%;             margin: 0;             margin-top: 5px;         }         results {  WebSockets      111  www.it-ebooks.info               height: 85%;             width: 95%;             margin: 0 auto;             padding: 5px;             overflow: auto;             border: 1px solid gray;         }         message {             margin-left: 10px;         }         update {             float: right;             margin-right: 10px;             margin-bottom: 10px;         }                &nbsp;       Update              Figure 4-9. Status of buses on the M4 route  If you don’t want to wait for the next status report to come from the server, you can click the Update button to get the status right away. It sends an update request to the server like this:  112      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   ws.send 'update' ;  Using  WebSockets  requires  no  special  permissions  or  anything  else  in  the  mani‐ fest.json file. As usual, the app’s JavaScript code is entirely in the window.onload handler:  window.onload = function    {  var ws = new WebSocket 'ws:  23.21.124.185:5002' ;    Bus status server ws.onclose = function    {     showMessage 'Not connected' ; }; ws.onopen = function    {     showMessage 'Connected', true ;     ws.onmessage = function  event  {         if  event.data  {             showStatus JSON.parse event.data  ;         }         else             showMessage 'No data received' ;     }; }; ws.onerror = function  e  {     console.log e ; }  document.querySelector "update" .addEventListener "click",     function    {         ws.send 'update' ;     }  ;     ... rest of app  };  Messages are shown by using showMessage, which is what we’ve seen in earlier examples.  See “Local Files” on page 22.  Observe that setting the ws.onmessage handler is deferred until a callback to the ws.onopen handler confirms that the WebSocket is connected; this is just to make sure that we don’t execute setup code too soon. When data arrives from the server, it’s converted to a JavaScript object with JSON.parse and then displayed by using showStatus:  function showStatus obj  {     var buses = [];     var lineRef;     obj.Siri.ServiceDelivery.VehicleMonitoringDelivery.forEach          function  vmd  {             vmd.VehicleActivity.forEach                  function  va  {  WebSockets      113  www.it-ebooks.info                       var mvj = va.MonitoredVehicleJourney;                     buses.push mvj ;                     lineRef = mvj.LineRef;                 }              ;         }      ;     buses.sort          function a, b  {             return  a.VehicleRef < b.VehicleRef  ? -1 :                a.VehicleRef > b.VehicleRef  ? 1 : 0;         }      ;     var s = " " + lineRef + " &bull; " +       obj.Siri.ServiceDelivery.ResponseTimestamp + " ";     buses.forEach          function  bus  {             s += " " + bus.VehicleRef + " &bull; " +               bus.DestinationName + " ";             s += bus.MonitoredCall.StopPointName + " &bull; " +               bus.ProgressRate + " &bull; " +               bus.MonitoredCall.Extensions.Distances.PresentableDistance;         }      ;     document.querySelector 'results' .innerHTML = s; }  As I mentioned in “A Weather Report App” on page 91, you need to work on this sort of display code a bit as you come to terms with the JSON that the server returns. This app is pretty simple, but that’s because most of the work is being done on the server. To build the server, I had to register it with the MTA, figure out its APIs, and incorporate it into a WebSocket server. Just to be clear, the WebSocket protocol is different from the HTTP protocol, and you can’t use WebSockets to execute APIs that expect HTTP interaction  so-called REST APIs . As yet, no mainstream websites that I know of have a WebSocket API  it’s pretty new , but they are increasingly being used internally, within client server applications.  The bus status WebSocket server was written by me for this book, not by the MTA.  Google Cloud Messaging So far in this chapter, we’ve confined our communication to executing APIs provided by servers. Now, it’s time to look at Google Cloud Messaging  GCM , which can send messages from a Google server to applications to provide information about software updates, weather alerts, news flashes, calendar events, or anything else that needs to be efficiently broadcast.  114      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   This kind of messaging is also called push messaging, because these messages are pushed from  server  to  client,  not  pulled  by  the  client  from  the  server.  The  corresponding Chrome API was actually called chrome.pushMessaging, but that API was very difficult to use from the server side and has since been replaced by chrome.gcm, which is com‐ patible with GCM for Android and is much easier to use. Figure 4-10 shows the overall GCM architecture. You begin by creating a project on the Google Developers Console, identified by its project number  shown at the bottom of Figure 4-10 .  More about project numbers shortly.  A Chrome App that wants to use GCM executes the  chrome.gcm.register call to get a registration ID, which is unique for each Chrome App  identified by its app ID , user, and project number. The Chrome App uploads that registration ID to the app server, the same server that handles the server-side of the application through whatever API has been designed for it by the developer. The app server stores the registration IDs  in a database or a file  for all clients to which it might want to send messages.  Figure 4-10. Google Cloud Messaging architecture  To send a GCM message, the app server sends to the GCM Connection Server  operated by Google  the message, the API key  obtained from the Google Developers Console , and a list of registration IDs that the message is to go to. The GCM Connection Server then sends the messages to the Chrome Apps associated with those registration IDs.  The  messages  are  received  by  chrome.gcm.onMessage  handlers  that  the  apps  have set up. For the Chrome App this is extremely efficient, because once the chrome.gcm.onMes sage handler is set up, there’s nothing further to do until a message arrives. In fact, the Chrome App doesn’t even have to be running—Chrome will activate it automatically when a message arrives.  Google Cloud Messaging      115  www.it-ebooks.info   Example Application Server Here we’ll see the code for a simple GCM-receiving Chrome App that receives GCM messages about buses at a stop on Fifth Avenue in New York. The example app server is a variation on the one used in “WebSockets” on page 109. It also queries the New York MTA Bus Time server, but it’s written in PHP instead of JavaScript running on Node.js. The implementation of this app server isn’t directly related to Chrome Apps  it would also serve Android apps , so it’s discussed, and the example PHP program is shown, in Appendix C. There I also describe how to send GCM messages from Amazon Simple Notification Service, which, unlike GCM itself, can also handle Apple Push Notification Service and Amazon Device Messaging. A typical GCM message sent to the Chrome App is:  12:45:50 -- M4 at stop; M4 1 stop away@5 AV WEST 47 - 46 ST  For simplicity the app server only monitors one stop, so the stop name after the @ is always the same. As we’ll see, all the Chrome App has to do when it receives the message is set the window title to the stop name and show the rest of the message in its window.  Example Client The Chrome App client displays the last 10 status updates, as shown in Figure 4-11.  Figure 4-11. Last 10 bus-status updates  The first thing a GCM client has to do is get a registration ID so it can tell the app server where to send messages. This is done with chrome.gcm.register:  116      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   chrome.gcm.register senderIDs, callback   senderIDs is an array of sender IDs, which are project numbers assigned by Google when a project is created  see Figure 4-10 . In our examples, there is only one project, but a single client could be interested in messages from several projects. The callback is called with the registration ID as its argument. One difference between this example client, called  NYCBusGCM, and those we’ve seen previously, is that all of the GCM-related code goes into the background.js file, not the app’s JavaScript file that’s referenced from its HTML file. This is to allow GCM messages to be received and handled even if the app isn’t running. Chrome remembers which events had handlers and reloads the background script automatically when such an event occurs and the script is inactive. It’s necessary to register a sender ID  project number  only once, provided the regis‐ tration ID is retained by the app for further use. It makes sense, then, to do the regis‐ tration when the app is first installed or updated, and then to save the registration ID in local storage  see “Setting and Getting Local Storage” on page 56 . That’s what’s done for chrome.runtime.onInstalled in background.js:  chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener      function   {         chrome.storage.local.get "registered",             function result  {                 if  !result["registered"]  {                     var senderIDs = ["806...503"];                     chrome.gcm.register senderIDs,                         function  registrationID  {                             console.log registrationID ;                             if  chrome.runtime.lastError                                  console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ;                             else                                 sendRegistrationID registrationID ;                         }                      ;                 }             }          ;     }  ;  If there is a new registration ID, it’s sent to the server by sendRegistrationID:  function sendRegistrationID registrationID  {        Should use https     Ajax.ajaxSend "http:  basepath.com servers gcmv2-bus.php?regid=" +       registrationID, 'json',         function  status, response  {             if  status == 200                  chrome.storage.local.set                      {  Google Cloud Messaging      117  www.it-ebooks.info                           registered: true                     }                  ;             else                 console.log 'Error sending registrationID' ;         }      ; }  The server is basepath.com servers gcmv2-bus.php  details are in Appendix C ; the re gid parameter tells it to store a registration ID and then to send messages to that reg‐ istration ID when there’s something to send. As the comment indicates, a registration ID needs to be kept secure, so https should have been used, but the website I use for examples isn’t set up for SSL. Note that Ajax.ajaxSend is being executed from the background script, so the techni‐ que we’ve been using of having it loaded by a common.html file referenced from in‐ dex.html won’t work. Rather, it has to be loaded along with background.js from the manifest, which lists two scripts instead of one. While we’re looking at manifest.json, note that it requests three permissions, gcm, storage  so the registration ID can saved , and "http:  basepath.com *"  so the registration ID can be uploaded to the server :  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [                 "background.js",                 "lib Ajax.js"             ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "NYCBusGCM",     "version": "1.0.0",     "permissions": [         "gcm",         "storage",         "http:  basepath.com *"     ] }  The app also has a window, which is created the normal way, except that it’s saved in a global so we can post messages to it from elsewhere in the background script, as we’ll see shortly: var win;  chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function  launchData  {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html', null,             function  createdWindow  {  118      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info                   win = createdWindow.contentWindow;             }          ;     }  ;  Note that the Chrome window object is what’s passed to the chrome.app.window.cre ate callback, and that the Document Object Model  DOM  window  what you normally manipulate with JavaScript  is in createdWindow.contentWindow. That’s all the setup we need to enable the app to receive GCM messages, but we still need to add a handler for the messages. It writes the message to the log  essential during development to understand what’s going on  and then posts it to the application win‐ dow:  chrome.gcm.onMessage.addListener      function message  {         console.log 'chrome.gcm.onMessage', message ;         win.postMessage message, '*' ;     }  ;   Posting and receiving window messages is standard DOM stuff; it’s not unique to Chrome Apps.  This example’s index.html is about as simple as one can be:                   NYCBusGCM                  The window’s JavaScript is simple, too:  var msgs = Array  ;  window.addEventListener "message",     function  messageEvent  {         showStatus messageEvent.data.data.message ;     }  ;  function showStatus message  {     var body = document.querySelector 'body' ;     body.innerHTML = '';     var a = message.split '@' ;     if  a.length > 1   Google Cloud Messaging      119  www.it-ebooks.info           document.title = a[1];     msgs.push a[0] ;     if  msgs.length > 10          msgs.shift  ;     for  var i = msgs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--          body.insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',           " " + msgs[i] ; }  Observe that the message received by the message handler is in messageEvent.data, which is the message received from GCM. It in turn has a data property with a mes sage property, which is why the string sent from the app server is referred to as messa geEvent.data.data.message. The showStatus function just breaks out the stop name  following the @ , sets it as the window title, and displays the status that preceded it. All the push and shift stuff is for limiting the display to the last 10 status updates.  Summary of IDs, Numbers, and Keys It took me a while to get all the GCM credentials straight, so I thought I’d do you a favor and summarize it all in one place:    Each GCM project you create with the Google Developers Console has a unique    That project number is also known as a sender ID; this is what you send to get a  project number.  registration ID.  user, and the project.   see Appendix C for details .    The registration ID uniquely identifies the combination of the app  by app ID , the    An app server needs an API key, which you get from the Google Developers Console    To cause a GCM message to be sent, the app server passes the API key, the list of  registration IDs, and the message to the GCM Connection Server.    One added twist: If you use something other than Google’s GCM Connection Server to send messages, you might find that a registration ID is referred to as a device token.  If  you’re  using  chrome.pushMessaging   the  predecessor  API  to chrome.gcm  things are much worse. If you’re struggling with client IDs, client secrets, redirect URIs, refresh tokens, and access tokens, you  have  the  wrong  API.  Thankfully,  chrome.gcm  dispenses  with those horrors. The 50 hours I spent chasing them down is lost and gone forever, but now at least Google has set things right.  120      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   App-to-App Messaging So far, we’ve see how GCM can send messages from the cloud to an app that’s asked for them, and we’ve also seen how to send a message to a window within an app, by using the standard window.postMessage DOM API. It’s also possible for a Chrome App to send a message to another app running on the same computer. You can do this by using the chrome.runtime.sendMessage API:  chrome.runtime.sendMessage appId, message, options, responseCallback   You need the app ID of the the app you want to send the message to, which is available from the Extensions page. To keep it from changing, you can fix it, as explained in Appendix B. The message can be a string, array, or object. The only available option is rarely used, so I won’t go into it, but you can check the API documentation for the details. The callback is called when the exchange is complete. An error occurred if  chrome.run time.lastError is defined in the callback; otherwise, the callback argument is the re‐ ceiver’s response. The receiving app should set an onMessageExternal listener:  chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener callback   When a message arrives, the callback is called with three arguments: the message, a MessageSender object that provides information about the sender  see the documen‐ tation for details , and a function that the callback can call to send a response, which is its single argument. If you want the response function to work after the callback returns, save it in a variable and return true from the event callback. You can also send a message by using chrome.runtime.connect, which keeps the port open and thus is more efficient for lots of messages than is chrome.runtime.sendMes sage. I won’t go into the details of chrome.runtime.connect here. To show how app-to-app messaging works, we’ll modify the bus-status Chrome App to get rid of its window and instead send a message to a different app. The new app, NYCBusGCM-s, now has only three files: background.js, Ajax.js  needed to send the reg‐ istration ID to the app server , and, as always, manifest.json. There are no permissions required to use chrome.runtime.sendMessage. The only change to background.js from the example in Figure 4-11 is to the  onMes sage handler that receives GCM messages:  chrome.gcm.onMessage.addListener      function message  {         console.log 'chrome.gcm.onMessage', message ;         chrome.runtime.sendMessage 'lgibpahbcalokboffnkpdcelgobbmkfd',           message.data.message, {},  App-to-App Messaging      121  www.it-ebooks.info               function  response  {                 if  chrome.runtime.lastError                      console.log 'chrome.runtime.sendMessage error',                       chrome.runtime.lastError ;                 else                     console.log response ;             }          ;     }  ;  When a GCM message arrives, it’s sent to the app with app ID lgibpahbcalokboffnkpd celgobbmkfd.  That  app,  called  ReceiveMessage,  doesn’t  use  GCM,  so  its  back‐ ground.js file is as simple as can be:  chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function  launchData  {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html' ;     }  ;  Its manifest.json is also simple, devoid of permissions, except that it has a key property so its app ID is fixed  see Appendix B :  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "ReceiveMessage",     "version": "1.0.0",     "key": "MIIBIjANBgkqhki...cv1dsGtG5UbWrj5aQIDAQAB" }  The index.html file is similar to what the earlier bus-status app had:                   ReceiveMessage                  The app’s JavaScript sets up an onMessageExternal handler in window.onload:  window.onload = function    {     chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener          function message, sender  {  122      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info               console.log 'chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal', message ;             showStatus message ;         }      ; };  The function  showStatus is identical to the one in Figure 4-11, and, indeed, when ReceiveMessage is running and receiving messages, its window shows the same infor‐ mation as that shown in Figure 4-11. Notifications There’s yet another kind of messaging: the transient display of a notification that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen, as shown in Figure 4-12.  Figure 4-12. A notification about bus status  Sending a screen notification uses the chrome.notifications API, primarily the call to create a notification:  chrome.notifications.create notificationId, options, creationCallback   The optional notificationId is a unique identifier that you make up that’s associated with the notification. This way, if a notification with the same ID is sent, any earlier ones are  first  cleared.  There  are  a  bunch  of  options,  which  you  can  read  about  in  the chrome.notifications API documentation; we’ll use the four that are required when you create a notification: type  basic, image, list, or progress  we’ll use basic   An icon to appear in the notification  iconUrl  title  message  The notification title  The notification message  Notifications      123  www.it-ebooks.info   Recall from Figure 4-11 that the bus-status messages have this form:  12:45:50 -- M4 at stop; M4 1 stop away@5 AV WEST 47 - 46 ST  We want the stop name  after the @  to be the notification title, and whatever precedes it to be the message. Here’s the onMessage handler in background.js that does the splitting and the creation of the notification  shown in Figure 4-12 :  Because we have an icon  examples up to now have omitted them , we might as well use it in the manifest, too. We also need notifications permission:  chrome.gcm.onMessage.addListener      function message  {         console.log 'chrome.gcm.onMessage', message ;         var a = message.data.message.split '@' ;         var title = 'Bus Status';         if  a.length > 1              title = a[1];         chrome.notifications.create              '',             {                 type: 'basic',                 iconUrl: 'icon128-bus.png',                 title: title,                 message: a[0]             },             function  notificationID  {             }          ;     }  ;  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [                 "background.js",                 "lib Ajax.js"             ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "NYCBusGCM",     "version": "1.0.0",     "icons": {         "128": "icon128-bus.png"     },     "permissions": [         "gcm",         "storage",         "notifications",         " "  124      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info       ] }  Unlike the example in “App-to-App Messaging” on page 121, here the app is complete; no app such as ReceiveMessage is needed to show the bus status, because notifications do it; nor is there any onLaunched event handler, because the app is never launched, only  loaded.  There  are  only  four  files:  background.js,  Ajax.js,  icon128-bus.png,  and manifest.json. Moreover, the app continues to work and show notifications even if it’s inactive  as long as it’s installed, of course . Figure 4-13 demonstrates that it goes inactive if no status arrives for about 15 seconds.  Figure 4-13. An app going inactive  For a background page  not other JavaScript files , Chrome remembers which handlers were set. The page is unloaded when it’s no longer needed  no windows and no consoles open , destroying all the handlers  but not the fact that they once existed  along with all the other code. When an event that it wanted to handle occurs, the page is reloaded. It executes from the top, as it did when it was first installed, reestablishing the handlers, and then the handler for the event that just occurred is called. In this way, apps that only occasionally need to execute take up very few resources, and certainly none for their code and associated data. Chapter Summary We’ve seen a lot of different approaches to messaging in this chapter, some unique to Chrome Apps, some part of HTML5, and some as old as the Internet:    The Socket API provides basic Internet communication. You can use it to imple‐  ment any Internet protocol.    For the HTTP protocol, whether to fetch web pages or execute REST APIs, you can use the standard JavaScript XMLHttpRequest API, wrapped by a convenient Ajax object.  Chapter Summary      125  www.it-ebooks.info     There’s a chrome.identity API for handling OAuth2, with a special call just for accessing Google APIs. After the app is authorized, you invoke API operations via HTTP.    HTML5  includes  WebSockets,  which  are  easier  to  use  and  more  efficient  than HTTP protocols, but they do require somewhat exotic server-side programming. The Chrome App end is easy.    Google Cloud Messaging  GCM  can send messages from the cloud to any running apps that have registered to receive them. You can even send GCM messages from Amazon Simple Notification Service and from other commercial servers.    If you just want to go from window to window within an app, you can use the old  and standardized window.postMessage.    The chrome.runtime API can send messages between Chrome Apps on the same    The chrome.notifications API can display a transient notification at the top of  computer.  the user’s screen.  126      Chapter 4: Networking and Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 5 Graphics and Imaging  Many Chrome Apps don’t just display text and forms; they display graphics of all sorts, both those drawn by the app and those brought into the app, such as photographs. Many of the related APIs are part of HTML5 and aren’t unique to Chrome Apps, but their use in Chrome Apps does have its peculiarities, as I’ll describe in this chapter. I’ll also show you  how  to  use  the  mediaGalleries  API  that  is   as  of  this  writing   unique  to Chrome Apps. Outputting Graphics Until now, all of our examples showed fairly mundane user interfaces, built up from simple HTML objects, mostly text areas and buttons. However, desktop apps need to be much snazzier, with more-advanced GUIs. The next few sections describe six different ways to create a user interface: simple text, HTML tables, positioned HTML, drawing on a canvas, Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG , and creating a PDF. Next, we’ll look at how to display images, chiefly JPEGs. Finally, we’ll investigate the Chrome mediaGalleries API, which makes it straightforward for your app to access media files stored on the local computer.  Calendar Example To show all the different ways of displaying graphics from a Chrome App, we’ll imple‐ ment the same calendar example each way. The calendar-related part of the app, which calculates the months and days, will stay the same; only the output code will change as we go through all six variations. Figure 5-1 shows the first variation, a plain-vanilla calendar that displays as just text.  127  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-1. A plain calendar rendered as text  The manifest.json file is straightforward, as shown here:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "Calendar",     "version": "1.0.0",     "permissions": [         {             "fileSystem": [                 "write"             ]         },         "webview"     ] }  The background.js file is as minimal as they get: chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function  launchData  {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html' ;     }   ;  128      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info  The index.html file is simple, too. The CSS is designed to make the div that contains the calendar scroll:                    Calendar                             body, html {             height: 100%;             width: 100%;             margin: 0;         }         holder {             height: 100%;             width: 100%;             margin: 0 auto;             overflow: auto;             position: absolute;         }                         Now comes the Calendar.js file that contains the calendar-producing code. This code depends on an OutputText object to do the actual rendering  plain text, in this first case :  var output = OutputText;  buildCalendar  new Date   .getFullYear   ;  function buildCalendar year  {     output.start  ;     window.resizeTo output.pageWidth  , 800 ;      for  var month = 0; month < 12; month++  {         if  month > 0              output.addPage  ;         changeMonth month ;         var row = 1;         for  var day = 1; day <= 31; day++  {             var date = new Date year, month, day ;             if  date.getFullYear   != year  date.getMonth   != month                  break;    day does not exist in this month             var dayOfWeek = date.getDay  ;             if  dayOfWeek === 0 && day > 1                  row++;             output.text row, dayOfWeek, 'date', day.toString  , 5, 20 ;  Outputting Graphics      129  www.it-ebooks.info           }         drawGrid row ;     }     output.write  ;      function changeMonth monthToShow, wantLines  {         var m = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May',           'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October',           'November', 'December'][monthToShow];         output.text 0, 0, 'month', m + '  ' + year, 0, 24 ;         ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',           'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'].forEach              function  weekday, index  {                 output.text 0, index, 'weekday', weekday, 0, 0 ;             }          ;     }  }  We build the calendar by going through the months, from 1 to 12, and then the days of each month, from 1 to 31, stopping when we get to a day that doesn’t exist  for example, 31-April or 29-Feb in a non–leap year . The call to drawGrid at the end of the for loop for the months is empty for text output, because no grid is drawn:  function drawGrid numRows  { }  We’ll see the grid in subsequent examples. OutputText, and the other output objects we’ll introduce later, has these methods: OutputText.start    Start the output, doing whatever setup work is needed.  OutputText.pageWidth    Return the page width in pixels.  OutputText.addPage    Begin a new page. This is needed before every month but the first.  OutputText.text row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset   Output text in row row of the month’s page, and in week column col  for example, column  1  for  Monday .  type  is  month  for  a  month  title   for  example,  January 2014 ,  weekday for a weekday name  for example,  Monday , and  date for a day number  for example, 27 . The text to output is x, and it’s offset by xOffset and yOffset, in pixels, from the start of row and col. You will see more clearly how to use OutputText as we progress through the examples.  130      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   OutputText.write    Write the output if it’s been accumulated in a buffer.  OutputText.line x1, y1, x2, y2   Draw a line from the point  x1, y1  to  x2, y2 , measured in pixels, with the origin at the upper-left corner of the page.  This is not used in the first, text-only, example.   In the code for our text-only calendar, note that the month title and weekday names are written on row 0 of each page, and the dates are written in rows 1 through 4, 5, or 6, depending on the number of weeks in which the month’s days occur. For example, 1- March-2014 was on a Saturday; thus the 31 days in March for this particular year span six weeks, requiring that many rows of dates, as you can see in Figure 5-1.  Rendering the Calendar as Text Following is the code for OutputText, which outputs the text calendar in Figure 5-1. Notice that the xOffset and yOffset arguments of OutputText.text are ignored, and that OutputText.line doesn’t do anything:  var calDiv = document.querySelector "calendar" ;  var OutputText =  function    {     var prevRow = -1;     var para;      var api = {         cellWidth: 0,         cellHeight: 0,          start: function    {             calDiv.style['font-family'] = 'monospace';         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             if  type === 'weekday'                  s = s.substr 0, 2 ;             else if  type === 'date' && s.length === 1                  s = '&nbsp;' + s;             if  row !== prevRow  col === 0  {                 para = document.createElement 'p' ;                 para.style['margin-left'] = '10px';                 for  var i = 0; i < col; i++                      para.insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend', '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ;                 calDiv.appendChild para ;             }             para.insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend', s + ' ' ;             prevRow = row;         },  Outputting Graphics      131  www.it-ebooks.info           addPage: function    {             calDiv.insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend', ' ' ;         },          pageWidth: function    {             return 150;         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             return 0;         },          write: function    {         }     };     return api; }   ;  There are a few of things to note about OutputText.text:    We’ve set a monospaced font in OutputText.start, to make it very easy to line up the columns. In later examples, we’ll use Times, which is a proportional font that makes the positioning less straightforward.    We show just the first two letters of each weekday name, so that the names line up  with the dates. For the same reason, we pad one-digit dates to two characters.    The row !== prevRow  col === 0 condition means that we’ve gone to a new row or we’re at column 0, in either case of which we need to start a new paragraph. The column 0 case is for handling the weekday names, because they, along with the month title, are in row 0.    If the first week of the month  a new paragraph  doesn’t begin on a Sunday, we must add padding to move the date to the correct horizontal position, which is what the for loop does.  If you can follow this text example, you’re all set to keep up as we look at the next five versions of Output objects, because, as I mentioned earlier, the buildCalendar function never changes.  132      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Rendering the Calendar as a Table A text-only calendar is fine for a reference, but if you want to hang it on the wall, you’ll want something more like the one shown in Figure 5-2. Because it’s mostly a grid of rows and columns, the obvious way to render it is as an HTML table.  Figure 5-2. Our calendar rendered as table  Rather than setting up a separate app example for each rendering illustration, I’ve in‐ stead combined them into one example that shows six windows. We haven’t yet en‐ countered a background.js file that creates more than one window on an onLaunched event, but here’s one that creates six:  chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function  launchData  {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html' ;         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html',             {             },             function  createdWindow  {                 createdWindow.contentWindow.outputType = 'Table';             }          ;         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html',  Outputting Graphics      133  www.it-ebooks.info               {             },             function  createdWindow  {                 createdWindow.contentWindow.outputType = 'HTML';             }          ;         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html',             {             },             function  createdWindow  {                 createdWindow.contentWindow.outputType = 'Canvas';             }          ;         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html',             {             },             function  createdWindow  {                 createdWindow.contentWindow.outputType = 'SVG';             }          ;         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html',             {             },             function  createdWindow  {                 createdWindow.contentWindow.outputType = 'PDF';             }          ;     }  ;  Each window has a different value for the outputType property of the DOM window, which is accessed as createdWindow.contentWindow, where createdWindow is the ar‐ gument to the chrome.app.window.create callback function—again, something else we haven’t had to use until now. Because each of the windows loads the same index.html file  which we’ve already seen  it’s up to the Calendar.js file to decide how to render the calendar, based on the value of the outputType property. That’s done by setting the global output to the corresponding object via this switch statement:  if  !window.outputType      window.outputType = 'Text';  var output;  switch  window.outputType  { case 'Text':     output = OutputText;     break; case 'Table':     output = OutputTable;  134      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info       break; case 'HTML':     output = OutputHTML;     break; case 'Canvas':     output = OutputCanvas;     break; case 'SVG':     output = OutputSVG;     break; case 'PDF':     output = OutputPDF; } document.title = 'Calendar - ' + window.outputType;  Observe that in Calendar.js the property is referenced as window.outputType, because window is the DOM window; in background.js it was referenced as createdWindow.con tentWindow.outputType. Because the buildCalendar function was written to reference the rendering object as output, the appropriate rendering takes place according to how the switch statement sets output. As a preview of coming attractions, Figure 5-3 shows five of the windows: the text and table versions  which we already saw  along with the HTML, Canvas, and SVG versions. The PDF rendering at the right of Figure 5-3 was captured in a PDF reader app  Preview, on Mac OS X.  Whereas OutputText started a new paragraph, OutputTable starts a new   element, and the padding for months that don’t start on a Sunday is done by appending   elements:  var OutputTable =  function    {     var sizeBig = 20;     var sizeSmall = 14;     var marginHorz = 36;     var marginVert = 36;     var prevRow = -1;     var table, tr;      var api = {         cellWidth: 100,         cellHeight: 80,         margins: {             top: marginVert,             bottom: marginVert,             left: marginHorz,             right: marginHorz         },          start: function    {  Outputting Graphics      135  www.it-ebooks.info               table = document.createElement 'table' ;             table.border = 0;             table.cellPadding = 0;             table.style['border-collapse'] = 'collapse';             table.style['margin-left'] = this.margins.left + 'px';             table.style['margin-bottom'] = this.margins.bottom + 'px';             calDiv.appendChild table ;         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             var that = this;              if  type === 'weekday'  {                 xOffset =  this.cellWidth - this.getTextWidth s, 'small'     2;                 yOffset = output.cellHeight * .8;             }             if  row !== prevRow  col === 0  {                 if  prevRow > 0                      while  tr.childNodes.length < 7                          appendTd tr, null, true ;                 tr = document.createElement 'tr' ;                 table.appendChild tr ;                 prevRow = row;             }             while  tr.childNodes.length < col                  appendTd tr, null, true ;             if  type === 'month'                  appendTd tr, s, false, 7 ;             else                 appendTd tr, s, row > 0 ;              function appendTd tr, s, border, colSpan  {                 var td = document.createElement 'td' ;                 td.width = that.cellWidth + 'px';                 td.height = that.cellHeight + 'px';                 if  colSpan  {                     td.colSpan = 7;                     td.style['text-align'] = type === 'month' ? 'center' : 'left';                     td.style['vertical-align'] = 'bottom';                 }                 else                     td.style['vertical-align'] = 'top';                 if  border                      td.style.border = '1px solid black';                 if  s  {                     var p = document.createElement 'p' ;                     p.style.fontFamily = 'Times';                     var fSize = type === 'weekday' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig;                     p.style.fontSize = fSize + 'px';                     p.style['margin-top'] =   yOffset  0  -                       fSize * .6  + 'px';    Move up to position at baseline.                     p.style['margin-left'] =  xOffset  0  + 'px';  136      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info           pageWidth: function    {             return this.margins.left + 7 * this.cellWidth + this.margins.right;         },                      p.style['margin-bottom'] = 0;                     p.style['margin-right'] = 0;                     p.innerText = s;                     td.appendChild p ;                 }                 tr.appendChild td ;             }         },          addPage: function    {         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {                table has the lines         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             return measureText s,               fontSize === 'small' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig ;         },          write: function    {             for  var c = tr.childNodes.length; c < 7; c++                  api.text prevRow, c, 'date' ;         }     };     return api; }   ;  The month titles are written into   elements that span all seven columns. Most of the code has to do with setting up CSS for the HTML elements to handle the offset arguments to OutputTable.text and to handle horizontal and vertical alignment. This code isn’t hard to follow, but it’s hard to explain the principles behind it, except to say that I kept revising it until the table looked the way I wanted it to. That’s generally how CSS gets written, in any app. We’ll see later that the graphical rendering techniques— Canvas, SVG, and PDF—are much easier to work with when it comes to positioning. HTML elements such as   use the top for positioning  CSS top attribute , whereas the  graphical  techniques   Canvas,  SVG,  and  PDF   use  the  baseline,  as  shown  in Figure 5-4.  Outputting Graphics      137  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-3. calendar rendered six different ways  The  buildCalendar function assumes baseline positioning, which is why  OutputTa ble.text adjusts the text up in the internal appendTd function.  We’ll see the same thing in OutputHTML.  An adjustment of .6 of the font size seems to do the trick:  p.style['margin-top'] =   yOffset  0  - fSize * .6  + 'px';  Figure 5-4. Text location and width  Weekday names need to be centered in their cells, which is done by computing their x offset, for which we need to know their width in pixels  see Figure 5-4 . You do this by using  the  OutputTable.getTextWidth  method,  which  calls  measureText   see Example 5-1 , a function based on one contributed to Stack Overflow.  138      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Example 5-1. Function to measure the width of text function measureText text, fontSize  {     var div = document.createElement 'div' ;     document.body.appendChild div ;     div.style.fontFamily = 'Times';     div.style.fontSize = fontSize + 'px';     div.style.position = 'absolute';     div.style.left = -1000;     div.style.top = -1000;     div.innerHTML = text;     var width = div.clientWidth;     document.body.removeChild div ;     return width; }  All this function does is add a   element to the document, measure it, and then get rid of it. The  OutputTable.write method fixes a quirk of tables when the  border-collapse attribute is set to collapse: empty cells on the last row don’t have rules, as shown in the left window in Figure 5-5. The problem is fixed by writing a suitable number of empty cells, as shown in the right window. This is another reason why outputting tables re‐ quires a lot of tuning before things look the way you want them to.  Figure 5-5. Calendar with and without missing cells  Outputting Graphics      139  www.it-ebooks.info   Rendering the Calendar as Positioned HTML All right, one more HTML-based rendering before we get into the juicy graphical stuff, this time with what I call “positioned HTML.” What we’re going to do is output HTML   and   elements, using CSS pixel positioning to place them exactly where we want them. This is actually easier than using tables because we don’t need to wrestle with the automatic layout that tables want to control. It’s a technique that probably ought to be used more often than it is. One HTML oddity that we’ll exploit is that, at least in Chrome, you can draw a vertical line with an   element. All you need to do is define the height greater than the width. Here’s the code for OutputHTML:  var OutputHTML =  function    {     var sizeBig = 20;     var sizeSmall = 14;     var marginHorz = 36;     var marginTop = 36;      var api = {         cellWidth: 100,         cellHeight: 80,         pageOffset: marginTop,         margins: {             top: marginTop,             bottom: 0,             left: marginHorz,             right: marginHorz         },          start: function    {         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             if  type === 'weekday'  {                 xOffset =  this.cellWidth - this.getTextWidth s, 'small'     2;                 yOffset = output.cellHeight * .8;             }             var p = document.createElement 'p' ;             p.innerText = s;             p.style.margin = 0;             p.style.padding = 0;             p.style.fontFamily = 'Times';             var fSize = type === 'weekday' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig;             p.style.fontSize = fSize + 'px';             p.style.position = 'absolute';             p.style.top =  this.pageOffset + row * this.cellHeight + yOffset -               fSize * .6  + 'px';    Move up to position at baseline.             p.style.left =  this.margins.left + col * this.cellWidth +               xOffset  + 'px';  140      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info               if  type === 'month'                  p.style.width = 7 *  this.cellWidth  + 'px';             else                 p.style.width = this.cellWidth + 'px';             p.style['text-align'] = type === 'month' ? 'center' : 'left';             calDiv.appendChild p ;         },          addPage: function    {             this.pageOffset += 8 * this.cellHeight;         },          pageWidth: function    {             return this.margins.left + 7 * this.cellWidth + this.margins.right;         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {             var hr = document.createElement 'hr' ;             hr.setAttribute 'noshade', true ;             hr.style.position = 'absolute';             hr.style.top =  this.pageOffset + Math.min y1, y2   + 'px';             hr.style.left =  this.margins.left + Math.min x1, x2   + 'px';             if  x1 === x2  {                 hr.style.width = '.1px';                 hr.style.height =  Math.abs y2 - y1  - 1  + 'px';             }             else {                 hr.style.width =  Math.abs x2 - x1  - 1  + 'px';                 hr.style.height = '.1px';             }             calDiv.appendChild hr ;         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             return measureText s,               fontSize === 'small' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig ;         },          write: function    {         }     };     return api; }   ;  This object is much simpler than OutputTable. Now, the lines are actually drawn by using the OutputHTML.line method; OutputText didn’t draw lines at all, and Output Table used table borders. Here, as in OutputTable, buildCalendar expects text to be vertically positioned on the baseline, which is how Canvas, SVG, and PDF output behave, whereas a   element’s top attribute refers to its top  refer back to Figure 5-4 . This difference is handled, as  Outputting Graphics      141  www.it-ebooks.info   before, in OutputTable.text by fudging the paragraph up a bit, the results of which you can see in Figure 5-6.  Figure 5-6. Calendar rendered as positioned HTML HTML5 Canvas New in HTML5, a canvas allows you to draw pixels on a raster-based, fixed-sized area that you define by using a   element. Unlike all other HTML elements, there’s no way to specify what’s on the canvas with HTML—for that, you need to use the Java‐ Script Canvas API. The canvas holds only the pixels you’ve placed there, and nothing else. It has no memory of the drawing operations themselves  rectangles, lines, text, and so on . After you draw it, you cannot modify or delete a shape, although you can certainly draw over it. Also, you can’t attach event handlers to shapes, because they don’t exist on the canvas, although you can certainly attach event handlers to the   element as a whole, because it does exist. That much said, drawing on a canvas is pretty convenient, and it affords the sort of operations you’d expect in a modern graphics package. After a canvas is drawn, it’s also  142      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   possible to get its pixels as an image and even write them out as a file, such as a PNG or a JPEG. A good source of detailed information is the book HTML5 Canvas, Second Edition by Steve Fulton and Jeff Fulton  O’Reilly . Here I’ll just introduce a few basic Canvas API calls; there are many more that I won’t cover.  A Simple Canvas Example We’ll first look at a simple canvas example and then show the OutputCanvas object, which can draw a calendar onto a canvas. The simple example utilizes this index.html file, which does nothing more than create a   element:                   Canvas Example                       "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write"         ]     } ]  Because we’ll be writing the canvas to a JPEG file, we need write permission on the filesystem:  The background.js is the usual boring one that just opens a window  one window! . This example draws the shapes shown in Figure 5-7. First comes the canvas object itself and the two-dimensional context within which we actually draw:  var canvas = document.querySelector 'canvas' ; var context = canvas.getContext '2d' ;  For now, only 2d is officially supported; there’s also webgl for 3D, but as of this writing it’s experimental.  HTML5 Canvas      143  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-7. Output from our canvas example  Next, we draw the outer black border and the gray interior:  context.fillStyle = 'ddd'; context.strokeStyle = 'black'; context.lineWidth = 3; context.fillRect 5, 5, 500, 500 ; context.strokeRect 5, 5, 500, 500 ;  The arguments of the fillRect method are the starting x and y coordinates  upper left of the rectangle  and the width and height. The strokeRect method is similar. There’s no actual circle method; instead, you create an arc path and fill it, as shown by this code, which draws a circle with a gradient fill:  var gradient = context.createRadialGradient 200, 310, 0, 260, 310, 150 ; gradient.addColorStop .1, "white" ; gradient.addColorStop 1, "black" ;  context.beginPath  ; context.arc 200, 310, 150, 0, 2 * Math.PI ; context.fillStyle = gradient; context.fill  ;  144      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   The first three arguments to createRadialGradient are the x and y coordinates of the center of the starting circle, followed by its radius. The last three arguments are for the ending circle. The addColorStop method sets a color transition for the gradient; its arguments are a position in the range 0 to 1 between the start and end, and a color. Here, white is located 10 percent from the start  the inner circle , and black is at the end. The arguments to arc are the x and y coordinates of the center, the radius, and the starting and ending angles in radians. For a circle, the start angle is 0  and the end is 360 , which is 2π radians. The fill method closes the path and fills the circle with the gradient. Next, let’s add some text at the top of the drawing:  context.font = "50px Times"; context.fillText 'This is some text', 30, 80 ;  The last two arguments to fillText are the x and y coordinates. The y coordinate is that of the baseline  again, refer back to Figure 5-4 . Here’s some rotated text:  context.save  ; context.translate 420, 250 ; context.rotate Math.PI   180 * 80 ; context.textAlign = "center"; context.fillStyle = "white"; context.lineWidth = 1; context.fillText "Some rotated text", 0, 0 ; context.strokeText "Some rotated text", 0, 0 ; context.restore  ;  The translate and rotate methods rotate the entire context, not specifically the text. The fillText method then draws in this modified coordinate system. The text is also stroked, to create the outlined effect that you can see in Figure 5-7. The context is saved before the translation and rotation, and then restored, so subsequent canvas operations won’t be affected. Finally, here’s code to stroke a line from  50, 100  to  400, 450  in the original coordinates system and to call saveFile to save the drawing in a file  which we’re going to see next :  context.lineWidth = 4; context.beginPath  ; context.moveTo 50, 100 ; context.lineTo 400, 450 ; context.stroke  ;  saveFile canvas ;  The saveFile function creates a Blob from the canvas and then writes it to a file chosen by the user.

The resulting JPEG looks exactly like the drawing in Figure 5-7.  Drawing the Calendar by Using a Canvas Because a canvas is fundamentally graphical, it’s easier to draw the calendar into a canvas than it is to mess around with tables and HTML, for which positioning was a design afterthought. We’ve already seen all of the canvas operations in OutputCanvas, except for measureText, which is built in to the Canvas API, so we don’t need the function that appeared in Example 5-1. Here’s the code, which is much more straightforward than the earlier output objects:  var OutputCanvas =  function    {     var sizeBig = 20;     var sizeSmall = 14;     var marginHorz = 36;     var marginTop = 36;     var canvas;     var ctx;      var api = {         cellWidth: 100,         cellHeight: 80,         pageOffset: marginTop,         margins: {             top: marginTop,             bottom: 0,             left: marginHorz,             right: marginHorz         },          start: function    {             canvas = document.createElement 'canvas' ;             canvas.width = this.pageWidth  ;             canvas.height = 12 * 8 * this.cellHeight;             calDiv.appendChild canvas ;             ctx = canvas.getContext '2d' ;         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             var x, y;  HTML5 Canvas      147  www.it-ebooks.info               var fontSize = type === 'weekday' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig;              if  type === 'weekday'  {                 xOffset =  this.cellWidth - this.getTextWidth s, 'small'     2;                 yOffset = output.cellHeight * .8;             }             ctx.font = fontSize + "px serif";             if  type === 'month'  {                 var titleWidth = this.getTextWidth s, fontSize ;                 x =  this.pageWidth   - titleWidth    2;                 y = this.pageOffset + yOffset;             }             else {                 x = this.margins.left + col * this.cellWidth + xOffset;                 y = this.pageOffset + row * this.cellHeight + yOffset;             }             ctx.fillText s, x, y ;         },          addPage: function    {             this.pageOffset += 8 * this.cellHeight;         },          pageWidth: function    {             return this.margins.left + 7 * this.cellWidth + this.margins.right;         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {             ctx.lineWidth = .5;             ctx.beginPath  ;             ctx.moveTo this.margins.left + x1, this.pageOffset + y1 ;             ctx.lineTo this.margins.left + x2, this.pageOffset + y2 ;             ctx.stroke  ;         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             ctx.font =  fontSize === 'small' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig  + "px serif";             return ctx.measureText s .width;         },          write: function    {         }     };     return api;  }   ;  Figure 5-8 shows the calendar rendered onto a canvas  the “Calendar - Canvas” window in Figure 5-3 .  148      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-8. Calendar rendered onto a canvas Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  Unlike a canvas, which retains only the pixels, an SVG image is composed of discrete objects, which are represented in the DOM. This means that you can construct an SVG image directly in an HTML file, like this:                   Simple SVG Example                       Figure 5-9 shows the output in Chrome  as an HTML page, not as an app .  Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG       149  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-9. SVG circle shown in browser  The only way to draw an SVG image is by adding elements to an   tag; there’s no drawing API as there is with canvases, for which the API is the only way to draw. They’re opposites in this respect. Canvases came with HTML5, but SVG is much older, having been standardized by the W3C since 1999. You can study the API at www.w3.org TR SVG, or you can get the book SVG Essentials, Second Edition by J. David Eisenberg and Amelia Bellamy-Royds  O’Reilly .  Another SVG Example In this section, we’ll look at a more elaborate example—this time as a Chrome App— which  draws  some  shapes  similar  to  those  we  drew  with  a  canvas   Figure  5-7 . Figure 5-10 presents the SVG version. This app’s background.js just opens a window loaded from index.html, and its mani‐ fest.json requests no permissions. Here’s the index.html file:                   SVG Example                                                150      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info                                     <rect x="5" y="5" width="500" height="500" stroke-width="3"       stroke="black" fill="ddd"  >           <text font-size="50" font-family="Times" x="430" y="50"       fill="white" stroke="black"       transform="rotate 80 400,40 ">         Some rotated text           <line x1="50" y1="100" x2="400" y2="450"  stroke-width="4"       stroke="black"  >        Figure 5-10. Output from SVG example  Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG       151  www.it-ebooks.info   In the   element, there’s a definition for a gradient, somewhat like the one we saw in “A Simple Canvas Example” on page 143, except here we didn’t need to define a center or starting and ending circles. Next comes the background gray rectangle with a black border, represented by a single   element. Then, the circle filled by the gradient that we defined. After that, some rotated text, both filled and stroked, and finally the line. But where’s the horizontal text, “This is some text”? That element is created by the JavaScript in SVG.js  referenced from the index.html file :  window.onload = function    {  var svg = document.querySelector 'svg' ; var text = document.createElementNS "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg", "text" ; text.setAttribute 'font-family', 'Times' ; text.setAttribute 'font-size', 50 ; text.setAttribute 'x', 30 ; text.setAttribute 'y', 80 ; var textNode = document.createTextNode 'This is some text' ; text.appendChild textNode ; svg.appendChild text ;  };  Notice that you create SVG elements by using document.createElementNS  NS stands for namespace , not with document.createElement, and you must specify the name‐ space, as we did in this line:  var text = document.createElementNS "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg", "text" ;  Differences Between Canvas and SVG Apart from the methods you use to draw, there are several other differences between SVG and Canvas:    Because SVG elements exist as long as the drawing does, you can modify or delete them from JavaScript, just as you can any DOM element. By contrast, a canvas keeps its pixels but has no memory of how they got there.    Many drawing programs can export images as SVG, which you can then incorporate  into an HTML file.    You can attach event handlers to SVG elements  as we’ll see later .   SVG images scale as the resolution of the window changes, whereas a canvas never  changes from the resolution at which it was drawn.  152      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   This last point is demonstrated in Figure 5-11, which shows the canvas and SVG ex‐ amples zoomed in a browser to 500 percent. The SVG scales right up, whereas the pixels for the canvas version just get bigger. Although this is an important difference in many web applications, it doesn’t matter much in Chrome apps, because an app window can’t zoom.  To prepare the figure, I had to create the drawings in a browser window.   Figure 5-11. Zooming in shows the scalability of SVG  To show how to attach an event handler to an SVG element, here’s some additional code added to SVG.js:  text.addEventListener 'click',     function  e  {         textNode.data = "You clicked me.";     }  ;  Now, when you click on the text at the top of Figure 5-10, you see the results depicted in Figure 5-12. How do you decide whether to use a canvas or an SVG? Here are some considerations:    If you’re going to draw in JavaScript, calling the Canvas API is much easier than creating SVG elements, modifying their attributes, and inserting them into parent elements.    If you have hundreds or thousands of shapes, a canvas will be much more efficient because all those shapes don’t have to persist as DOM elements. Thus, a canvas is probably a better choice for games and other highly interactive applications.   If you need scalability or need to add event handlers, SVG is a better choice.   If  a  designer  rather  than  a  programmer  is  to  draw  the  image,  SVG  is  more  approachable.  Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG       153  www.it-ebooks.info     There are several canvas JavaScript libraries  KineticJS, EaselJS, Fabric, Paper, and  so on  that make drawing easier; there are far fewer SVG libraries.  Figure 5-12. The output from SVG example after clicking the text at the top  Drawing the Calendar by Using SVG Figure 5-13 shows the calendar rendered via SVG; it’s almost indistinguishable from the canvas version in Figure 5-8.  154      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-13. Our calendar rendered as SVG  The code for OutputSVG is similar to OutputCanvas, too, when you account for the fact that, instead of drawing shapes, SVG elements are created:  var OutputSVG =  function    {     var sizeBig = 20;     var sizeSmall = 14;     var marginHorz = 36;     var marginTop = 36;     var svg;      var api = {         cellWidth: 100,         cellHeight: 80,         pageOffset: marginTop,         margins: {             top: marginTop,             bottom: 0,             left: marginHorz,             right: marginHorz         },          start: function    {             svg = document.createElementNS "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg", "svg" ;             svg.setAttribute 'width', this.pageWidth   ;  Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG       155  www.it-ebooks.info               svg.setAttribute 'height', 12 * 8 * this.cellHeight ;             calDiv.appendChild svg ;         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             var x, y;             var fontSize = type === 'weekday' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig;              if  type === 'weekday'  {                 xOffset =  this.cellWidth - this.getTextWidth s, 'small'     2;                 yOffset = output.cellHeight * .8;             }             if  type === 'month'  {                 var titleWidth = this.getTextWidth s, fontSize ;                 x =  this.pageWidth   - titleWidth    2;                 y = this.pageOffset + yOffset;             }             else {                 x = this.margins.left + col * this.cellWidth + xOffset;                 y = this.pageOffset + row * this.cellHeight + yOffset;             }             var text = createSVGText s, fontSize ;             text.setAttribute 'x', x ;             text.setAttribute 'y', y ;             svg.appendChild text ;         },          addPage: function    {             this.pageOffset += 8 * this.cellHeight;         },          pageWidth: function    {             return this.margins.left + 7 * this.cellWidth + this.margins.right;         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {             var line = document.createElementNS "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg",               "line" ;             line.setAttribute 'x1', this.margins.left + x1 ;             line.setAttribute 'y1', this.pageOffset + y1 ;             line.setAttribute 'x2', this.margins.left + x2 ;             line.setAttribute 'y2', this.pageOffset + y2 ;             line.setAttribute 'stroke', 'black' ;             line.setAttribute 'stroke-width', .5 ;             svg.appendChild line ;         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             var text = createSVGText s, fontSize ;             svg.appendChild text ;             var w = text.getComputedTextLength  ;             svg.removeChild text ;  156      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info               return w;         },          write: function    {         }     };     return api;      function createSVGText s, fontSize  {         var text = document.createElementNS "http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg", "text" ;         text.setAttribute 'font-family', 'Times' ;         text.setAttribute 'font-size', fontSize ;         var textNode = document.createTextNode s ;         text.appendChild textNode ;         return text;     }  }   ;  Creating PDFs If you’ve been reading this book all the way to this point, you’ve learned about files, databases, networking, and graphics, but you might be wondering why I never men‐ tioned printing. After all, typical productivity apps for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux provide a way to print, and Google clearly wants Chrome Apps to be on a par with them someday. Here’s why I haven’t mentioned printing: you can’t do it. There’s no Chrome or HTML API for printing, other than for printing a whole window. Instead, you create a PDF file and let the user print it outside of the app. There’s no standard API for PDFs either, but there are a few third-party JavaScript libraries you can use. I’ve tried only jsPDF, which has some rough edges, but it works, so  that’s  the  one  I’ll  describe  here.  You  can  read  about  it  and  download  it  from github.com MrRio jsPDF and parall.ax products jspdf.  .ax is the top-level domain for the Åland Islands. Cute!  One thing about all the PDF libraries I’ve looked at, including those for PHP, is that you build up the PDF file, but nothing is output until you explicitly write it. That’s the chief motivation for having the write method in all of the Output objects we’ve been studying. In a conventional web app that creates a PDF from JavaScript, there’s no good place to write it to, because all files are sandboxed. But, we know from Chapter 2 and what we’ve already seen in this chapter that you can easily write a PDF to an external file. We’ll see the code for that shortly. Because the file:   protocol isn’t allowed, there’s no way to open the PDF as an external file in an app window or even in a browser window. However, as we’ll see when we get to the OutputPDF calendar object, you can read the FileEntry for the PDF as a data URL and refer to it that way, either as a link to a browser  outside of the Chrome App   Creating PDFs      157  www.it-ebooks.info   or as a   element placed directly in the Chrome App window. Of course, the user can certainly locate the file manually  the user previously chose the location and name for it  and open it manually, by double-clicking it, for example.  A Simple PDF Example Let’s begin our look at jsPDF with a simple example that creates a two-page PDF, as illustrated in Figure 5-14.  Figure 5-14. Output from PDF example shown in the Mac OS X Preview app  The index.html file is about as simple as it can be:                   PDF Example                        The background.js file is also minimal:  chrome.app.runtime.onLaunched.addListener      function  launchData  {         chrome.app.window.create 'index.html' ;  158      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Because the example will write a PDF to a file, you need to request fileSystem per‐ mission in the manifest.json file, which we’ve seen a bunch of times already:  To use PDF.js, it’s necessary to include several files that come with it, loaded by com‐ mon.html, but I’ll postpone showing exactly what’s loaded and how until later, when I explain how the calendar is rendered as a PDF. Here’s the code using PDF.js for this simple example:      }  ;  "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write"         ]     } ]  var pdf = new jsPDF 'l', 'pt', 'letter' ; pdf.setFont 'Times', 'Roman' ; pdf.setFontSize 50 ; pdf.text 'Page One', 50, 200 ; pdf.setLineWidth 3 ; pdf.lines [[400, 400]], 20, 20 ; pdf.addPage  ; pdf.text 'Page Two', 50, 200 ; pdf.setLineWidth 3 ; pdf.lines [[-390, 500]], 400, 20 ; pdf.output 'save' ;  Here are some hints to reading the nonobvious parts of the code:    The constructor specifies landscape orientation  as opposed to portrait , dimen‐  sions in points, and letter-size paper.    The origin is at the upper left of the page.   The arguments to the lines method mean that the line starts at the point given by the last two arguments and extends to the point given by the first argument, which is relative to the starting point. The complex first argument allows for Bezier curves, but  here  I’m  just  drawing  a  line.  See  the  documentation  at  mrrio.github.io  jsPDF doc for all the gory details.    The output method as it comes is set up to show the PDF in a browser window, but that won’t work with Chrome Apps, because the app’s window is not a browser window. Instead, there’s an undocumented save argument that invokes a global saveAs method that you must supply:  saveAs blob, options   Creating PDFs      159  www.it-ebooks.info   The blob argument is a Blob representing the PDF, and the options argument is what‐ ever was passed as a second argument to output  which in the preceding example is nothing . My implementation of saveAs lets the user choose a file and then saves the PDF to that file:  function saveAs blob, options  {    Must be global.     chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry          {             type: 'saveFile'         },         function  entry  {             if  entry                  saveToEntry blob, options, entry ;         }      ; }  function saveToEntry blob, options, entry  {     entry.createWriter          function writer  {             writer.onerror = errorHandler;             writer.truncate 0 ;             writer.onwriteend = function    {                 writer.write blob ;                 writer.onwriteend = function    {                     if  options.callback                          options.callback blob, entry ;                 };             };         },         errorHandler      ; }  function errorHandler e  {     console.log e ; }  The various file API calls were described in Chapter 2.  I’ve implemented things so that a callback function can be supplied to output, which allows the calling app to arrange to do more with the PDF than just write it to a file. For instance, here’s a version that displays the saved path to the user, using chrome.file System.getDisplayPath, which is described in Chapter 2:  160      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   pdf.output 'save',     {         callback: function  blob, entry  {             chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath entry,                 function callback displayPath  {                     document.querySelector "body" .                       insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',                       ' Wrote PDF to ' + displayPath ;                 }              ;         }     }  ;  You can see the output in Figure 5-15.  Figure 5-15. PDF example window showing the saved path  Although jsPDF’s built-in output option to show a PDF won’t work with Chrome Apps, you can do the same thing by generating a data URL from the Blob, somewhat similar to what we did to show images in “Accessing the Facebook API” on page 97. It’s also useful to provide a link so that the PDF will show in a browser—as long as the link specifies target="_blank" so that it’s shown in the default browser.  Recall that Chrome Apps are forbidden to do any navigation within themselves.  Here’s another version of a call to output that displays a link and also shows the PDF in a   element:  pdf.output 'save',     {  Creating PDFs      161  www.it-ebooks.info           callback: function  blob, entry  {             chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath entry,                 function callback displayPath  {                     document.querySelector "body" .                       insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',                       ' Wrote PDF to ' + displayPath ;                     showPDF blob ;                 }              ;         }     }  ;  function showPDF blob  {     var reader = new FileReader  ;     reader.onload = function event  {         document.querySelector "body" .           insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',           'Click <a target="_blank" href="' + event.target.result +             '">here  to see it in a browser.' ;         document.querySelector "body" .           insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',           ' <webview src="' + event.target.result +             '" style="width:100%; height:700px;"> ' ;     };     reader.onerror = function e  {         console.log e ;     };     reader.readAsDataURL blob ; }  To use a webview, you need webview permission in the manifest.json file:  "permissions": [     {         "fileSystem": [             "write"         ]     },     "webview" ]  Figure 5-16 shows the output in the Chrome App window. If you click on the link, you see the same PDF in a browser. If you hover the mouse pointer over the embedded PDF in the Chrome App window, you see some controls, but only the zooming controls work. Unfortunately, clicking the save and print icons does nothing. That’s not true of the PDF display in a browser, of course—there, the controls actually work.  There’s no need for the user to save the PDF in a file, because it has already been saved in a location of the user’s choosing.   162      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-16. PDF example window showing embedded PDF  Creating PDFs      163  www.it-ebooks.info   Thus, you have three ways to provide a PDF to the user:    Save it to a file and let the user deal with it as he or she sees fit.   Provide a link that shows the PDF in a browser window.   Show the PDF in a webview.  Outputting the Calendar as a PDF We now have almost everything we need to show the calendar as a PDF, which you can see in Figure 5-17. There are two API calls the calendar example needs that are present in the jsPDF implementation, but not as exposed interfaces.  This is what I meant earlier when I said that jsPDF had some rough edges.  We can get around that limitation by subclassing jsPDF with a new, extended class jsPDFX, like this  in the jsPDFX.js file :  function jsPDFX orientation, unit, format, compressPdf  {     var pdf = new jsPDF orientation, unit, format, compressPdf ;     var pdfx = Object.create pdf ;      pdfx.getWidth = function  s  {         return pdfx.getStringUnitWidth s  * pdfx.internal.getFontSize               pdfx.internal.scaleFactor;     };     pdfx.getPageSize = function    {         return pdfx.internal.pageSize;     };     return pdfx; }  In the OutputPDF code that we’re going to see shortly, we instantiate jsPDFX rather than jsPDF. We need to load two plug-ins that come with jsPDF as well as the base file and our two files saveAs.js and jsPDFX.js:                  Now, with all of that set up, we can code OutputPDF:  var OutputPDF =  function    {     var sizeBig = 20;     var sizeSmall = 14;     var pdf;      var api = {         cellWidth: 100,  164      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info           cellHeight: 80,         margins: {             top: 36,             bottom: 0,             left: 0,             right: 0         },          start: function    {             pdf = new jsPDFX 'l', 'pt', 'letter' ;             this.margins.left = this.margins.right =                pdf.getPageSize  .width - 7 * this.cellWidth    2;             pdf.setFont 'Times', 'Roman' ;         },          text: function  row, col, type, s, xOffset, yOffset  {             var x, y;              if  type === 'weekday'  {                 xOffset =  this.cellWidth - this.getTextWidth s, 'small'     2;                 yOffset = output.cellHeight * .8;             }             pdf.setFontSize type === 'weekday' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig ;             if  type === 'month'  {                 var titleWidth = pdf.getWidth s ;                 var pageSize = pdf.getPageSize  ;                 x =  pageSize.width - titleWidth    2;                 y = this.margins.top + yOffset;             }             else {                 x = this.margins.left + col * this.cellWidth + xOffset;                 y = this.margins.top + row * this.cellHeight + yOffset;             }             pdf.text s, x, y ;         },          addPage: function    {             pdf.addPage  ;         },          pageWidth: function    {             return pdf.getPageSize  .width;         },          line: function  x1, y1, x2, y2  {             pdf.setLineWidth 1 ;             pdf.lines [[x2 - x1, y2 - y1]], x1 + this.margins.left,               y1 + this.margins.top ;         },          getTextWidth: function  s, fontSize  {             pdf.setFontSize fontSize === 'small' ? sizeSmall : sizeBig ;  Creating PDFs      165  www.it-ebooks.info               return pdf.getWidth s ;         },          write: function    {             pdf.output 'save',                 {                     callback: function  blob, entry  {                         chrome.fileSystem.getDisplayPath entry,                             function callback displayPath  {                                 document.querySelector "calendar" .                                   insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',                                   ' Wrote PDF to ' + displayPath ;                                 showPDF blob ;                             }                          ;                     }                 }              ;         }     };     return api;      function showPDF blob  {         var reader = new FileReader  ;         reader.onload = function event  {             document.querySelector "calendar" .               insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',               'Click <a target="_blank" href="' + event.target.result +                 '">here  to see it in a browser.' ;             document.querySelector "calendar" .               insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend',               ' <webview src="' + event.target.result +                 '" style="width:100%; height:680px;"> ' ;         };         reader.onerror = function e  {             console.log e ;         };         reader.readAsDataURL blob ;     } }   ;  166      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-17. The calendar rendered as PDF Working with Images As I explained in “Accessing the Facebook API” on page 97, you can easily show an image by using a standard HTML   element, as long as you’re showing a data URL containing Blob data representing the image. You can’t refer to the image’s URL directly with an http or file protocol as you would in a web page. The code to do that was incorporated into a getBlobUri method of a Photo object.  Accessing Image Thumbnails and Metadata There are APIs for getting FileEntry objects referring to images, as we’ll see in “The mediaGalleries API” on page 173, but there are no other Chrome APIs for dealing with images themselves. Unlike other platforms you might have used  for example, Mac OS X , Chrome provides no way to get thumbnails or metadata  date time, F-number,  Working with Images      167  www.it-ebooks.info   camera model, and so on , except for a few fields that you can retrieve by using the mediaGalleries API. However, it is possible—although not easy—to read an image file to extract its thumbnail and metadata entirely in JavaScript. This is because they’re stored inside the file in data structures that you can read by using ordinary file I O methods. The code to do it is complicated and not specific to Chrome Apps, so I won’t go into it in detail here, but you can find it included in the example code for this book. Look for the  Metadata example  which we’ll discuss shortly  for the exifdata.js file. In the following, I sketch briefly how the thumbnail and metadata code in exifdata.js works:    Generally, if all you want is a thumbnail and some metadata, you don’t want to read the entire image file into memory, because it might be 10 MB or more. Given a File  a subclass of Blob , you can use its slice method to pick off just part of it, perhaps the first 64 KB, where the thumbnail and metadata are usually located. Then, you instantiate a FileReader to read just that slice.    In reading image files, you almost always need to pay attention to byte order: little- endian  Intel  or big-endian  Motorola . Knowing the order, you then must convert two- or four-byte quantities to signed or unsigned integers. Instead of coding this yourself, you can use a little-known API built in to Chrome  and many browsers  called DataView.    To find your way around JPEG and other image formats, you need to study the  relevant standards documents. The documents that you’ll want to read are: “Parsing Exif client-side using JavaScript” “Description of Exif file format” JPEG File Interchange Format JPEG File Interchange Format File Format Summary TIFF Revision 6.0  In exifdata.js, all of the above is incorporated into an ExifData object that you instantiate with a FileEntry as an argument, like this:  var exifdata = new ExifData.Exif fileEntry ;  Then, you can extract the metadata and thumbnail URL by using the  getMetadata method, like this:  exifdata.getMetadata      function  metadata, thumbURL  {            do something with metadata and thumbURL     }  ;  168      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   The metadata argument is a string that you can display directly as, for example, the innerText of a   element, and thumbURL is a data URL suitable for direct use as the src attribute of an   element. To see how you use those two arguments, we’ll look at an example app that displays an image, its thumbnail, and its metadata, as demon‐ strated in Figure 5-18.  Figure 5-18. An image, embedded thumbnail, and metadata  The background.js and manifest.json files for this example are nothing special, except that fileSystem permission is needed because the example will use chrome.fileSys tem.chooseEntry to open the image file  see “External Files” on page 42 . The index.html file shows the image, its thumbnail, and its metadata:       Working with Images      169  www.it-ebooks.info                Metadata                                                         <p id="metadata"       style="height: 300px; overflow: scroll; border: 1px solid black;">       For this example, common.html just loads the exifdata.js file. The interesting file is Metadata.js, which implements the app. Note that there’s really no user interface; the app just brings up the open-file dialog when it loads:  window.onload = function    {  chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry      {         type: 'openFile'     },     function  fileEntry  {         if  fileEntry  {             fileEntry.file                  function  file  {                     document.querySelector 'img' .src =                       URL.createObjectURL file ;                 }              ;              new ExifData.Exif fileEntry  .getMetadata                  function  metadata, thumbURL  {                     if  thumbURL                          document.querySelector 'thumb' .src= thumbURL;                     if  metadata                          document.querySelector 'metadata' .innerText= metadata;                 }              ;         }     }  ;  };  As you know by now, Chrome Apps aren’t allowed to display the path to a file directly in the src attribute of an   element, so we call URL.createObjectURL to convert a File  to  a  self-contained  data  URL  for  the  image,  which  can  be  displayed.  The  170      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   getMetadata method also provides a data URL for the thumbnail, so you can use it directly, as well, in the following line:  document.querySelector 'thumb' .src= thumbURL;  We’ll see another use of the ExifData object in “The mediaGalleries API” on page 173.  Image Rendering Quality There are three ways to show an image in a Chrome App window:    By using the   element, as we’ve already seen several times.   By using the drawImage method of a canvas context.   By using an SVG   element.  Usually, you’ll use whatever works with the graphical approach you’re using, but, if you’re free to choose your API, there’s a difference you should know about: if you’re not showing the image at its actual size, the HTML   and SVG   elements do a much better job of rendering than the canvas drawImage method does. To see this, consider the example app shown in Figure 5-19. In the figure the same 2411 x 2411 image has been reduced to 200 x 200, first by using an HTML   element, then by using Adobe Lightroom  a profesional-grade image-processing application , next by using the SVG  , and finally, by a canvas drawImage call. Looking at the lines  the ropes holding the sails , you can clearly see that the reduction done by the Canvas API is inferior to the others. Let’s look briefly at the code for this example. The background.js and manifest.json files are nothing special  no permissions , so we’ll skip those. Here’s the index.html file:                   ImageResize             Original 2411x2411; reduced to 200x200                       Reduced in HTML                Working with Images      171  www.it-ebooks.info       Reduced in Lightroom                                     Reduced by SVG                    Reduced by Canvas        Figure 5-19. A large image reduced by using four algorithms  The HTML and SVG renderings use the original 2411 x 2411 boat.jpg image file, and the  Lightroom  example  uses  a  200  x  200  image  exported  from  Lightroom, boat-200.jpg. The canvas code is in ImageResize.js:  window.onload = function    {     var canvas = document.querySelector 'cvs' ;     var canvasContext = canvas.getContext '2d' ;     var img = document.querySelector 'boat' ;  172      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info       canvasContext.drawImage img, 0, 0, 200, 200 ; };  I don’t know why Chrome’s canvas does so poorly, but I can guess: SVG is very old, even older than Chrome, so when the first version of Chrome was built, its developers quite naturally shared code between the core HTML, which certainly included the    element’s implementation, and their implementation of SVG. Canvas came along much later and was probably done by a different group who then stuck it into Chrome. Maybe someday the discrepancy I’ve shown will go away; all I can report is what I see now. The mediaGalleries API An app can call chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry to access an individual media file  image, video, or music , or even a directory of files, but it’s convenient if the media directories on the user’s computer can be accessed automatically, without the user having to choose them. That’s what the mediaGalleries API is for. It’s only for accessing media galleries, the files in them  as FileEntry objects , and some very limited metadata. You can’t use it to do anything with the media itself, such as cropping a photo or editing an audio track.  The Principal mediaGalleries API Methods I’ll discuss the principal mediaGalleries methods here; you can read about the others in the Chrome API documentation. You usually begin by requesting an array of the media galleries present on the computer with chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems. Each gallery acts like a FileSys tem; after you have a FileSystem object, you can operate on it with the API that we saw in “Local Files” on page 22. Here’s the call:  chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems details, callback   If the manifest requests the allAutoDetected permission, the galleries that the Chrome API knows about are automatically accessed:  "permissions": [     {         "mediaGalleries": [             "allAutoDetected"         ]     } ]  Here’s an example call:  chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems      {interactive: 'yes'},     function  mediaFileSystems  {  The mediaGalleries API      173  www.it-ebooks.info           console.log mediaFileSystems ;     }  ;  The callback argument to chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems is called with an array of DOMFileSystem objects, one per gallery, as you can see from the first few lines of the log, which has been formatted for readability:  [DOMFileSystem, DOMFileSystem, DOMFileSystem, DOMFileSystem,   DOMFileSystem, DOMFileSystem]     0: DOMFileSystem         name: "chrome-extension_fnn...-1"         root: DirectoryEntry         __proto__: DOMFileSystem     1: DOMFileSystem         name: "chrome-extension_fnn...-2"         root: DirectoryEntry         __proto__: DOMFileSystem     ...  There’s not much useful in the log, not even the names of the galleries. We’ll see how to get something more informative in a moment. If the first argument to chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems has an inter active value of yes, as it does in the preceding code example, a dialog box opens in which the user can manually select a gallery as well as view the list of galleries added to, as shown in Figure 5-20.  I don’t know how the empty item got there.   Figure 5-20. The dialog for choosing media galleries  174      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   The other choices for interactive are no, which suppresses the dialog, and if_need ed, which shows the dialog only if no galleries were automatically discovered. The chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystemMetadata method provides more information about a media gallery:  var mData = chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystemMetadata item   The argument is a mediaGallery  DOMFileSystem object  as retrieved by chrome.media Galleries.getMediaFileSystems. Note that this method is synchronous; the metadata is its return value. Here’s some code that displays metadata from each gallery:  chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems      {interactive: 'yes'},     function  mediaFileSystems  {         mediaFileSystems.forEach              function item, indx, arr  {                 var mData =                   chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystemMetadata item ;                 console.log mData ;             }          ;     }  ;  The log shows the following:  Object {galleryId: "1", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: "iTunes"} Media.js:175 Object {galleryId: "2", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: " Users marc Music"} Media.js:175 Object {galleryId: "3", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: " Users marc Pictures"} Media.js:175 Object {galleryId: "4", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: " Users marc Movies"} Media.js:175 Object {galleryId: "6", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: "Picasa"} Media.js:175 Object {galleryId: "8", isAvailable: true, isMediaDevice: false, isRemovable: false, name: "iPhoto"}  Now we can see things that make sense. The galleries have names such as “iTunes,” “ Users marc Music,” and so on. For each gallery, represented by a DOMFileSystem object, the root member gives its DirectoryEntry, so you can use the filesystem API calls in Chapter 2 to get at the actual directory and media files in the gallery, as we’ll see in the media browser example that’s coming up next.  The mediaGalleries API      175  www.it-ebooks.info   A Media Browser At this juncture, we can combine what we know about the mediaGalleries API, file and directory I O, displaying images, and accessing metadata with the ExifData object to build an example app that provides navigation in a pane at the left of the window and the media itself in a pane on the right, as shown in Figure 5-21. Figures 5-22, 5-23, and 5-24 show an audio track, a video, and an image, respectively. For images only, the ExifData object from “Accessing Image Thumbnails and Metadata” on page 167 is used to display thumbnails in the navigation  left  pane and metadata under the photo in the right pane.  Figure 5-21. Media browser showing the media filesystems  As usual for most of our examples, the background.js file is nothing special. The man‐ ifest.json file requests permission to access all of the media galleries and to read what’s there. It also requests fileSystem permission, which is needed by ExifData:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [ "background.js" ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "Media",     "version": "1.0.0",     "permissions": [         {  176      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info               "mediaGalleries": [                 "read",                 "allAutoDetected"             ]         },         "fileSystem"     ] }  Figure 5-22. Media browser showing an audio track  The index.html file is somewhat lengthy, but all it really does is set up the two panes as cells in a table. The navigation pane on the left has an id of tdtoc, and the content pane on the right is assigned an id of content. That pane has two divisions: view for the media, and, for images, metadata for the metadata:                   Media                             body, html {             width: 100%;             height: 100%;  The mediaGalleries API      177  www.it-ebooks.info               margin: 0;             font-size: 12px;         }         table {             border-collapse: collapse;             height: 100%;             width: 100%;             margin: 0 auto;             position: absolute;         }         p {             margin-bottom: 2px;             margin-top: 2px;             margin-left: 5px;         }         td, tr {             height: 100%;         }         toc {             width: 250px;             height: 100%;             overflow: auto;             border-right: 1px solid gray;              *margin-left: 5px;*          }         tdtoc {             width: 250px;             height: 100%;         }         content {             height: 100%;             overflow: auto;         }         view {             padding: 10px;             font-size: 16px;         }         heading {             margin-bottom: 8px;             margin-top: 4px;             font-size: 16px;             font-weight: bold;         }         .thumbnail {             vertical-align: middle;             margin-right: 5px;             display: block;         }         .de {             font-weight: bold;             font-size: 14px;         }  178      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info                                                                    Figure 5-23. Media browser showing a video  Note that some of the CSS, such as that for heading, is for elements that aren’t present in the HTML but will be added dynamically from the JavaScript. Now onto Media.js. The only tricky part is the implementation of the Back link at the top of the navigation pane  see Figure 5-22 . To implement it, there is a global  global to the onload handler, that is  variable to hold a stack:  var stack = [];  The mediaGalleries API      179  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 5-24. Media browser showing an image  Each time a directory is visited, the code calls the doDirectoryEntry function  which we’ll see in its entirety soon , and an object containing that DirectoryEntry and its name is pushed onto the stack:  function doDirectoryEntry de, name  {     stack.push { item: de, name: name } ;        rest of function }  Then, when the Back link is clicked, the DirectoryEntry for the directory being shown in the navigation pane is discarded from the top of the stack, and the one just under it, which represents the last one visited, is popped and then shown in the navigation pane:  stack.pop  ; var x = stack.pop  ; doDirectoryEntry x.item, x.name ;  We’ll see the stack-manipulation code in context as we review the entire implementation. Here’s how the app begins, by showing the media galleries in the navigation page  refer to Figure 5-21 :  180      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   window.onload = function    {  var entriesHolder; var stack;  getMediaFileSystems  ;  function getMediaFileSystems   {     stack = [];     document.querySelector 'toc' .innerHTML =       ' Media File Systems ';     chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystems          {interactive: 'yes'},         function  mediaFileSystems  {             var id = 0;             entriesHolder = [];             mediaFileSystems.forEach                  function item, indx, arr  {                     var mData =                       chrome.mediaGalleries.getMediaFileSystemMetadata item ;                     document.querySelector 'toc' .insertAdjacentHTML                        'beforeend',                       '  ' +                         mData.name + ' ' ;                     entriesHolder.push item.root ;                 }              ;         }      ; }     ... rest of app ... };  Here’s a bit of narration to help you follow this code:    As we’ve done before, the entire application is in the onload handler.   The DirectoryEntry for each gallery  item.root, in the loop  is saved in the en triesHolder array, so we can find it later when the user clicks the corresponding link.    The index into entriesHolder, represented by the id variable, is set as the id of  the   element for that item in the navigation pane.    The   elements have a class of de, which will be important in detecting clicks,  as we’re about to see.  When the user clicks anything in the navigation pane, the app must determine what was clicked and then take the appropriate action. The click might have been on the Back  The mediaGalleries API      181  www.it-ebooks.info   link, a directory, or a media file. That’s all done by the onclick event handler for the navigation pane:  document.querySelector 'toc' .onclick = function  e  {     if  e.target && e.target.nodeName == 'A'  {         if  e.target.id === 'back'  {             if  stack.length > 1  {                 stack.pop  ;                 var x = stack.pop  ;                 doDirectoryEntry x.item, x.name ;             }             else                 getMediaFileSystems  ;         }         else if  e.target.className === "de"  {             doDirectoryEntry entriesHolder[parseInt e.target.id ],               e.target.innerText ;         }         else if  e.target.className === "media"  {             showMedia entriesHolder[parseInt e.target.id ] ;         }     }     return false; }  Because the click could be anywhere at all in the toc division, we need to access e.tar get to see if we’re on an   element and, if we are, what kind of element it is:    If its id is back, it’s the Back link.   If its class is de, it’s a directory.   If its class is media, it’s a media file.   Otherwise, the click is ignored.  For directories, the id gives the index into entriesHolder, so the saved DirectoryEn try can be accessed, and the doDirectoryEntry function is called with that and the name that appeared as arguments. For media files, showMedia is called, although here the object in entriesHolder is a FileEntry. Here’s doDirectoryEntry:  function doDirectoryEntry de, name  {     stack.push { item: de, name: name } ;     if  !name          name = de.name;     document.querySelector 'toc' .innerHTML = '';     document.querySelector 'toc' .insertAdjacentHTML        'beforeend',       '  Back ' ;     document.querySelector 'toc' .insertAdjacentHTML   182      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info         'beforeend',       ' ' + name + ' ' ;     var id = 0;     entriesHolder = [];     var dr = de.createReader  ;     dr.readEntries          function  entries  {             entries.forEach                  function item, indx, arr  {                     if  item.isDirectory  {                         document.querySelector 'toc' .insertAdjacentHTML                            'beforeend',                           '  ' +                             item.name + ' ' ;                         entriesHolder.push item ;                     }                     else {                         var toc = document.querySelector 'toc' ;                         var p = document.createElement 'p' ;                         toc.appendChild p ;                            img as object so closure below will grab it                         var img = document.createElement 'img' ;                         img.className = 'thumbnail';                         p.appendChild img ;                         var a = document.createElement 'a' ;                         a.className = 'media';                         a.id = id++;                         a.href = '';                         a.innerText = item.name;                         p.appendChild a ;                         entriesHolder.push item ;                          new ExifData.Exif item  .getMetadata                              function  metadata, thumbURL  {                                 if  thumbURL  {                                     img.width = '125';                                     img.src= thumbURL;                                     p.style['margin-top'] = '10px';                                     p.style['margin-bottom'] = '10px';                                 }                                 item.metadata = metadata;                             }                          ;                     }                 }              ;         },         function  e  {             console.log e ;         }      ; }  The mediaGalleries API      183  www.it-ebooks.info   This function basically adds appropriate HTML to the navigation pane. Each item in the directory is either another directory, for which an   element with a class of de is added, or a media file. The only strange part is that an  img object is created and appended for every media file, even if it’s not an image. Then, an ExifData object is used to read its metadata, which produces a thumbURL only for images. The way the code is organized, if it’s not an image, the img won’t get a src attribute.  If you’re bothered by sourceless img tags, you can rework the code to avoid them. I’m not bothered by them.  It was this example that motivated me to write code in ExifData to extract thumbnails. The first version used the actual, full-size image to display the thumbnails, but that was ridiculously slow, because some of my JPEGs are several megabytes in size, and some of my image directories have hundreds of images. Taking 10 minutes to display the contents of a directory in the navigation pane is obviously unacceptable. By extracting the thumbnails, the process takes only a few seconds, even for large directories. And, as you can see from the code, this is an asynchronous operation, so the user is free to click a link without having to wait for all the thumbnails to display. All we have left is showMedia: function showMedia item  {     var viewDiv = document.querySelector 'view' ;     var metadataDiv = document.querySelector 'metadata' ;     viewDiv.innerHTML = '';     metadataDiv.innerHTML = '';     viewDiv.insertAdjacentHTML 'beforeend', ' ' + item.name + ' ' ;     item.file          function  file  {             chrome.mediaGalleries.getMetadata file, {},                 function  metadata  {                     if  metadata && metadata.mimeType  {                         var element;                         var mediaType = metadata.mimeType.split ' ' [0];                         var elementName = mediaType === 'image' ? 'img' :                           mediaType;                         element = document.createElement elementName ;                         element.setAttribute "controls", "controls" ;                         viewDiv.appendChild element ;                         element.style['max-width'] = '700px';                         element.style['max-height'] = '700px';                         element.src = URL.createObjectURL file ;                     }                 }              ;         },         error      ;     if  item.metadata          metadataDiv.innerText = item.metadata; }  184      Chapter 5: Graphics and Imaging  www.it-ebooks.info   This function shows the media and its metadata, if any  only images have any . To show the media, an element is added to the right pane. The type of element is determined by these two magical lines of code:  var mediaType = metadata.mimeType.split ' ' [0]; var elementName = mediaType === 'image' ? 'img' : mediaType;  The mediaType is given as the first part of the mimeType  audio mpeg, video mp4, image  jpeg, and so on . For images, we want an   element. Otherwise, we want a <vid eo> or   element, for which we use the mediaType directly. For   and   elements, we want controls, which we get with this line:  element.setAttribute "controls", "controls" ;  Images don’t have controls, but setting that attribute does no harm, so we keep the code simple by setting it anyway. What? That’s all? Indeed it is. From the functionality of this useful little app, you might have expected a lot more code, but there isn’t any more. Lots of little tricks—like using the id to hold the index into entriesHolder, going for metadata thumbnails even when there  aren’t  any,  and  using  the  mimeType  to  generate  the  correct  media-showing element—have all kept things very simple. Chapter Summary In this chapter, we went into various graphics and imaging APIs, including drawing with absolutely positioned HTML elements, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, and PDF. We’ve also  examined  some  quirky  issues  with  images  and  explained  how  to  use  the mediaGalleries API.  Chapter Summary      185  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   CHAPTER 6 Miscellaneous APIs  This chapter discusses a grab-bag of Chrome APIs, none of which warrants a full chapter of its own. Some of them are pretty useful, and others you’ll want to read about but will probably never use. Alarms JavaScript has always had a way to set one-time or periodic alarms by using the setIn terval and setTimeout functions, but their lifetime was limited to the lifetime of the program. When it stops, they’re gone. With the Chrome alarm APIs, you can set an alarm that lasts as long as the app is installed, even if its background page goes inactive. You create such an alarm with chrome.alarms.create:  chrome.alarms.create name, alarmInfo   The second argument is an object that has the following three properties: when  When the alarm should first fire, in milliseconds past the current time  Date.now     delayInMinutes  How long to delay until the alarm first fires  periodInMinutes  How long to wait between firings  One of the  when and  delayInMinutes properties is required, and  periodInMinutes should be present only if you want the alarm to fire more than once.  187  www.it-ebooks.info   When an alarm fires, it triggers a chrome.alarms.onAlarm event, the callback function of which receives an Alarm object as its argument, indicating which alarm fired. Its most important property is name. You clear an alarm by using chrome.alarms.clear:  chrome.alarms.clear name, callback   The callback function has a Boolean argument that indicates whether the alarm was cleared. There are also APIs to get information about existing alarms and to clear all alarms, which you can read about in the documentation. To see how alarms work, here’s an example that displays a notification reminding you to stretch every 20 minutes, as shown in Figure 6-1. When the alarm fires, the notifi‐ cation is generated with the chrome.notifications API that we saw back in “Notifi‐ cations” on page 123.  Figure 6-1. An alarm notification  This  example  has  no  HTML  or  JavaScript  files  other  than  background.js.  Its  mani‐ fest.json requests alarms and notifications permissions:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": [                 "background.js"             ]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "Alarm",     "version": "1.0.0",     "icons": {         "128": "icon128-alarm.png"     },     "permissions": [         "alarms",         "notifications"  188      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info       ] }  The icon is the one shown in Figure 6-1. We use this both for the app and for its noti‐ fications, as we’re about to see. Here’s background.js, which is the entire app: chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener      function   {         chrome.alarms.create "alarm-stretch",             {                 when: Date.now   + 10 * 1000,    in 10 seconds                 periodInMinutes: 20             }          ;     }  ;  chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener      function alarm  {         chrome.notifications.create              '',             {                 type: 'basic',                 iconUrl: 'icon128-alarm.png',                 title: "Alarm",                 message: 'Stand up and stretch!'             },             function  notificationID  {             }          ;     }  ;  Recall from “Notifications” on page 123 that after background.js executes, the back‐ ground page goes inactive because there’s no window active  see Figure 6-2 , although Chrome remembers that it had set a listener for the chrome.alarms.onAlarm event. When that event occurs  every 20 minutes, in this case , background.js is executed, thereby reestablishing that event’s handler, and then the event is handled by invoking the handler function, which generates the notification that pops up on the screen.  Alarms      189  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-2. The alarm app going inactive Context Menus If you right-click  or control-click on a Mac  with the mouse pointer inside a Chrome App window, nothing happens unless the app was loaded unpacked, in which case you get some debugging options, such as Reload App or Inspect Element. But you can create your own context menu by using chrome.contextMenus.create:  chrome.contextMenus.create createProperties, callback   Each call creates just one menu item; if you want several items, you must make a call for each one. The createProperties argument has a bunch of properties having to do with the style of the menu item  normal, checkbox, and so on , its title, the context in which it’s effective, and so forth. I’ll just get into the basic properties; you can read about the others in the chrome.contextMenus documentation. The  second  argument  is  a  callback  that  indicates  that  the  item  was  created,  with chrome.runtime.lastError being set if an error occurred. The background.js page for the simple example we’ll look at just creates a window loaded with index.html, which has just a paragraph of introductory text:                   Context Menus                  Right-click to choose something.       The manifest requests contextMenus permission:  {     ...     "permissions": [         "contextMenus"  190      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info       ] }  Here’s the app’s JavaScript file, contextMenus.js, which creates two menu items and a handler that’s called when the user clicks an item:  window.onload = function    {  function done   {     if  chrome.runtime.lastError          console.log chrome.runtime.lastError ; }  chrome.contextMenus.create      {         id: "menu-item-1",         title: "Menu Item 1"     },     done  ; chrome.contextMenus.create      {         id: "menu-item-2",         title: "Menu Item 2"     },     done  ;  chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener      function  info  {         document.querySelector 'para' .innerText =           "You clicked " + info.menuItemId;     }  ;  };  As of this writing, the documentation for context menus is in pretty bad shape. For example, it refers to extensions instead of apps, and it indicates that certain properties are required or prohibited for “event pages,” by which is meant the app’s background script, which I always name background.js. In fact, these rules seem to apply to all uses of context menus, which is either a bug or a documentation error. I suspect that it’s the latter. Anyway, when you run the app, right-clicking brings up the context menu shown in Figure 6-3. In the figure, the first menu item was chosen earlier, resulting in the text that’s shown in the window  put there by the event handler , and the second menu item is about to be chosen.  Context Menus      191  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-3. Choosing an item from a context menu Location The location API provides a way to determine the app’s geographical location or, to be more precise, the location of the device on which it’s running. You start by calling chrome.location.watchLocation  to  cause  a  chrome.location.onLocationUpdate event to be fired initially and whenever the location changes:  chrome.location.watchLocation name, requestInfo   The first argument names the request, but it’s optional and you can supply an empty string if you want. The second argument, also optional, is an object that provides pa‐ rameters such as the minimum distance and minimum time between location updates. Both default to zero, which means that all changes are reported. You can read about the details at developer.chrome.com apps location. To see the API in action, here’s a simple example with the usual boring background.js and manifest.json files, except that you need location permission:  192      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   The index.html file has a    element to report the location. There’s also an initial “Wait…” notice, because getting the location takes a few seconds:  {     ...     "permissions": [         "location"     ] }                   Location                  Wait...       window.onload = function    {  chrome.location.watchLocation '', {} ;  Here’s  the  important  part,  the  location.js  file.  This  just  shows  the  location  when  it changes:  chrome.location.onLocationUpdate.addListener      function position  {         document.querySelector 'para' .innerText = "You are at " +           position.coords.latitude + ' ' + position.coords.longitude;     }  ;  };  Figure 6-4 shows the result, and it’s pretty accurate. Because my desktop computer rarely moves, the chrome.location.onLocationUpdate event occurred only once, but had it been a more portable device that did move while the app was running, one or more subsequent updates would have occurred.  Location      193  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-4. An app showing current location Text-to-Speech With the tts  text-to-speech  API, you can make your app talk. The primary call is chrome.tts.speak, which utters the text supplied as its first argument:  chrome.tts.speak utterance, options, callback   The optional second argument is an object with properties that control the voice to be used, the speech rate, the pitch, and so on, although not every implementation supports every possibility. You can find more details at developer.chrome.com apps tts. The op‐ tional callback is called right away, perhaps before the speech even started, so you can check chrome.runtime.lastError to see if an error occurred. You can call chrome.tts.getVoices to get a list of the available voices:  chrome.tts.getVoices      function voices  {         console.log voices ;     }  ;  Part of the output from this call is shown in Figure 6-5.  194      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-5. Available voices for the tts API  A speaking example we’ll look at has the usual background.js and manifest.json files, the latter with tts permission:  The index.html file has a text area in which you can type whatever you want spoken, and a button that starts the speech:  {     ...     "permissions": [         "tts"     ] }                   Text-to-Speech                           <textarea id="textarea" cols="55"           rows="20">Text-to-speech example.             Speak   Text-to-Speech      195  www.it-ebooks.info        You can see this user interface in Figure 6-6, for which I’ve typed part of a famous speech.  Figure 6-6. Text-to-speech example  Here’s the tts.js file:  window.onload = function    {  document.querySelector "speak" .onclick = function    {     chrome.tts.speak          document.querySelector "textarea" .value,         {             voiceName: "Google UK English Female",             onEvent: function event  {                 console.log 'Event ' + event.type + ' at ' + event.charIndex ;                 if  event.type === 'error'                      console.log 'Error: ' + event.errorMessage ;             }         },         function   {             if  chrome.runtime.lastError                  console.log 'Error: ' + chrome.runtime.lastError.message ;         }      ; };  };  196      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   chrome.tts.speak is called with two options: voiceName, taken from Figure 6-5, and a callback function that indicates various events during the speaking. The Gettysburg Address sounds strange in a female English voice, but that’s computers for you. System Queries There are a few simple APIs for getting information about the system—specifically, CPU usage, displays, memory, network, and storage:  chrome.system.cpu.getInfo callback  chrome.system.display.getInfo callback  chrome.system.memory.getInfo callback  chrome.system.network.getNetworkInterfaces callback  chrome.system.storage.getInfo callback   Each callback function has a single argument that provides the requested information. There are some additional APIs, for such things as ejecting a storage device; you can read about these on the relevant pages, such as developer.chrome.com apps system_stor‐ age. Each info query has its own permission in the manifest.json file:  In the example program we’ll look at, background.js is as usual and the index.html file has no user interface at all because the output will be displayed on the console log:  {     ...     "permissions": [         "system.cpu",         "system.display",         "system.memory",         "system.network",         "system.storage"     ] }                   System                  Here’s system.js:  window.onload = function    {  chrome.system.cpu.getInfo   System Queries      197  www.it-ebooks.info       function  info  {         console.log info ;     }  ;  chrome.system.display.getInfo      function  info  {         console.log info ;     }  ;  chrome.system.memory.getInfo      function  info  {         console.log info ;     }  ;  chrome.system.network.getNetworkInterfaces      function  networkInterfaces  {         console.log networkInterfaces ;     }  ;  chrome.system.storage.getInfo      function  info  {         console.log info ;     }  ;  };  The output is shown in Figures 6-7, 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, and 6-11.

Memory information Camera There are no Chrome APIs for operating the computer’s camera; for that, you use the standard  HTML5  media  stream  APIs.  However,  you  do  need  to  request  videoCap ture permission in the manifest.json file:  {     ...     "permissions": [         "videoCapture"     ] }  200      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-12 shows an example app. The larger image is a live video of me fiddling with my computer. I smiled up at the camera and clicked the Take Photo button, resulting in the still capture in the smaller image.  Figure 6-12. Live video  on left  and a captured image  As you’ve come to expect, background.js is nothing special. Here’s the index.html file it references:                   Camera                         Take Photo              The first thing the app must do is connect the   element in the HTML to the camera with the HTML5 navigator.webkitGetUserMedia API  details in the “Media‐ Stream API” article on the Mozilla Developer Network :  window.onload = function    {  var img = document.querySelector 'img' ; var video = document.querySelector 'video' ;  Camera      201  www.it-ebooks.info   navigator.webkitGetUserMedia {video: true, audio: true},     function localMediaStream  {         video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL localMediaStream ;         video.onloadedmetadata = function e  {                ... video is loaded ...         };     },     function e  {         console.log 'Error:', e ;     }  ;  };  The first callback function receives a MediaStream object, which is converted to an object URL and then set as the   element’s src property. A handler for the onloaded metadata event is also set, but it doesn’t do anything in the example. The second callback  third argument  to navigator.webkitGetUserMedia is an error callback. After navigator.webkitGetUserMedia completes, video appears in the larger image, as shown in Figure 6-12. Following is the code for the button and its handler, also in the window.onload function:  var maxWidth = 300;  function capture   {     var canvas = document.createElement 'canvas' ;     canvas.width = maxWidth;     canvas.height = video.videoHeight * maxWidth   video.videoWidth;     canvas.getContext '2d' .drawImage video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height ;     var data = canvas.toDataURL 'image png' ;     img.setAttribute 'src', data ; }  document.querySelector 'shutter' .onclick = capture;  Because the captured image can’t be directly set into an   element, it’s first drawn into a canvas  see “HTML5 Canvas” on page 142  and then a data URL extracted from that canvas is set as the src property of the   element. That makes the still appear in the window  see Figure 6-12 . Bluetooth, USB, and Serial APIs Chrome provides APIs for connecting to three kinds of external devices: Bluetooth, USB, and serial. The APIs supply functionality to discover which devices are available and to open them in some sense, but the actual data sent back and forth is device-specific. This is similar to the situation with data files: the APIs handle discovering what’s there,  202      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   opening a connection, and transmitting data, but the actual data depends on the file: JPEG, Excel spreadsheet, some sort of calendar, or whatever. Chrome APIs don’t help with the data itself, only with the plumbing. There are too many APIs, too many devices, and too many complications to discuss in depth  here,  so  I’ll  just  explain  some  basic  Bluetooth  operations,  and  if  you  want to deal with these hardware devices, you can consult the relevant documentation pages for  chrome.bluetooth,  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy,  chrome.bluetoothSocket, chrome.usb, and chrome.serial. To use Bluetooth, you include a bluetooth section in your manifest.json file; there are no permissions:  {     ...     "bluetooth": {         "uuids": [ "1105", "1106" ],         "socket": true     } }  The uuids are numbers that identify Bluetooth profiles that the app will be using. Pro‐ files are specific data formats that are defined as part of various Bluetooth standards. This example specifies two, although it doesn’t do any actual data communication, as we’ll see. The background.js is the usual one that just opens a window. The index.html has a Discover button and a text area for results, and it also has some CSS for buttons that the JavaScript will add dynamically:                   Bluetooth                       .device {             display: block;             margin-top: 5px;         }                Discover                <textarea id="textarea" cols="55" rows="20" readonly           style='outline: none;'>             Bluetooth, USB, and Serial APIs      203  www.it-ebooks.info   The  app  in  bluetooth.js  first  queries  for  all  existing  device  connections  with  the chrome.bluetooth.getDevices API:  chrome.bluetooth.getDevices callback   The example makes this call and then shows the devices in the window as a series of buttons:  window.onload = function    {  chrome.bluetooth.getDevices      function devices  {         devices.forEach updateDeviceName ;     }  ;  function updateDeviceName device  {     log '\nadded: ' + device.name ;     console.log device ;     var b = document.createElement 'button' ;     b.className = 'device';     b.innerText = 'Connect to ' + device.name;     b.device = device;     b.onclick = function  e  {         connectTo e.srcElement.device ;     };     document.body.appendChild b ; };  function log msg  {     var m =  typeof msg  == 'object'  ? JSON.stringify msg  : msg;     console.log m ;     document.querySelector "textarea" .value += m + '\n'; }  };  You can see these buttons in Figure 6-13. I’ll show the connectTo function a bit later.  204      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-13. Initial list of devices with connection buttons  If a device is subsequently activated somehow for Bluetooth  the details are up to the device and the OS , the app can discover them by using chrome.bluetooth.startDis covery:  chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery callback   Because discovery uses a lot of resources, it’s important to stop it at some point with chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery:  chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery callback   The example calls chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery when you click the Discover button, and then it calls chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery 30 seconds later:  document.querySelector "discover" .onclick = function    {     chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery          function   {             log '\ndiscovery started' ;                Stop discovery after 30 seconds.             setTimeout                  function   {                     chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery function   {} ;                     log '\ndiscovery stopped' ;                 },                 30000              ;         }      ; };  Bluetooth, USB, and Serial APIs      205  www.it-ebooks.info   When a device is discovered, changed, or removed, an event is fired. Here’s the code that sets up handlers for these three events.  chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener updateDeviceName ; chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener updateDeviceName ; chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener removeDeviceName ;  The updateDeviceName function in the preceding example is what added the button for a device. Figure 6-14 shows an additional device that was discovered after the Discover button was clicked.  Figure 6-14. The list of devices after clicking the Discover button  The removeDeviceName function removes the corresponding button  the device con‐ nection itself has already been removed : function removeDeviceName device  {     log '\ndeleted: ' + device.name ;     for  var d of document.body.children  {         if  d.className === 'device' && d.device.address === device.address              document.body.removeChild d ;     } }  That’s really all this example can do. Here’s the connectTo function that acts as the button onclick handler, which creates a Bluetooth socket:  function connectTo device  {     var uuid = '1106';     var onConnectedCallback = function   {  206      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info           if  chrome.runtime.lastError  {             console.log "Connection failed: " +               chrome.runtime.lastError.message, device.name ;         }         else {             console.log 'Connected OK' ;                ... use connection as defined by profile ...         }     };      chrome.bluetoothSocket.create          function createInfo  {             console.log createInfo ;                ... should save createInfo.socketId ...             chrome.bluetoothSocket.connect createInfo.socketId,               device.address, uuid, onConnectedCallback ;         }      ; }  Attempting to connect results in an error, because I made no serious attempt to deter‐ mine the correct profile for any of the devices, much less implement that profile. That’s work for a Bluetooth expert, but at least you have some idea of how things operate from the Chrome API perspective. Internationalization and Localization Internationalization is designing your application so that it’s reasonably easy to config‐ ure it for a specific language and or culture. The configuration job is called localiza‐ tion. Because both words are hard to type and pronounce, they’re often abbreviated by the count of their interior letters: i18n and l10n. Internationalization mostly involves three kinds of information that varies depending on language and culture:    Strings   Dates and times   Numbers, including currency and percentages  Localization is mostly translating the strings from the language of the developer to some other language. After you have internationalized dates and numbers, localization is automatic and doesn’t require any human creativity and decision making. To the extent possible, it’s generally a good idea to globalize your user interface so as to reduce the amount of localization. For example, if you represent a date as 2014-06-12, users around the world will know what you mean. If you instead represent it as “June 12, 2014”, you will need to internationalize and then localize the month name. The same  Internationalization and Localization      207  www.it-ebooks.info   goes for the horrible choice 6 12 2014.  Even if you show it as 12 6 2014 for European users, you still have problems, for how are they to know that you’ve localized it?  Another example of globalization is using icons instead of words to represent actions, although even then you have to make sure that the icons are globally meaningful.  As you already know, outside of this section, I haven’t internationalized any of my examples, because that would make the source code harder to follow.   Internationalizing and Localizing Strings Most systems for internationalizing and localizing strings, including the Chrome App system, work like this:    In the code, each literal string is replaced by a key into a dictionary of strings.   There’s one dictionary per supported language, identified by a language identifier  such as en, de, or es.  setting.    At runtime, the effective language is chosen by the user or from a system-wide    Localizing for a specific language involves taking an existing dictionary, usually the one that the developer created, and translating the strings to create a new dictionary.  For Chrome Apps, you get a localized string with the call:  chrome.i18n.getMessage "messagename"   In this example, messagename is the key. In the manifest and CSS files, you refer to an internationalized string with the notation MSG_messagename. You can’t use that notation in HTML files—you have to modify strings with JavaScript, as I’m about to show. A language dictionary, which must be named messages.json, is coded in JSON as in this example, for English  locale en :  {   "hello": {     "message": "Hello",     "description": "The word 'Hello', to appear in the main window."   },   "goodbye": {     "message": "Goodbye",     "description": "The word 'Goodbye', to appear in the main window."   } }  For each key, there’s a message property that supplies the localized string, and an op‐ tional description that’s an aid to the translator. Here’s the corresponding Spanish dictionary:  208      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   {   "hello": {     "message": "Hola",     "description": "The word 'Hello', to appear in the main window."   },   "goodbye": {     "message": "Adiós",     "description": "The word 'Goodbye', to appear in the main window."   } }  The text needs to be in UTF-8, so make sure you’re using a text editor that supports that encoding. You put each messages.json in a folder named for its locale  en, es, and so on , and you put the local folders in a folder named _locales, as shown in Figure 6-15.  Figure 6-15. Source files set up for I18N  You have to add a default_locale property to the manifest, like this:  {     "app": {         "background": {             "scripts": ["background.js"]         }     },     "manifest_version": 2,     "name": "I18N",     "version": "1.0.0",     "default_locale": "en" }  The background.js file in the example is the usual one that just opens a window. Here’s the index.html file:                  I18N   Internationalization and Localization      209  www.it-ebooks.info                   [hello goes here]       [goodbye goes here]       What actually appears at runtime is determined by the JavaScript in i18n.js:  window.onload = function    {     document.querySelector "hello_phrase" .innerHTML =       chrome.i18n.getMessage "hello" ;     document.querySelector "goodbye_phrase" .innerHTML =       chrome.i18n.getMessage "goodbye" ; }  So, assuming that the computer’s locale is set to English, when the app is first launched you see what’s shown in Figure 6-16.  Figure 6-16. An app localized for English  If you then set your computer’s locale to Spanish  how you do that varies with your operating system , relaunch Chrome, and then launch the app, you get what’s shown in Figure 6-17.  210      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-17. An app localized for Spanish  In practice, here’s how you should internationalize strings:    Create messages.json files for two locales as you develop the app, so that you can  test that the internationalization mechanism works.    Choose your native locale  English, for me  for one of them and code the strings as  they should appear in that locale.    Pick any other locale for the other messages.json file. If you know that language, go ahead and enter the strings. If not, put in bogus strings for testing  as I’ll show in a bit .    As you develop the user interface, switch locales occasionally to ensure that strings  are being handled properly.    To localize the app, give the dictionary you developed in your native language to the translator, and then place the messages.json file that he or she produces into the proper folder. Then, provide a test version of the app to the translator so that he or she can verify that the translation went as expected.    Unfortunately, most people will be unable to translate a JSON file without making a few errors that mess up the JSON notation, so you’ll likely need to fix the files that you get back.  Because I know only one language, here’s an ersatz German dictionary I might use during development:  Internationalization and Localization      211  www.it-ebooks.info   {   "hello": {     "message": "Hello [de]",     "description": "The word 'Hello', to appear in the main window."   },   "goodbye": {     "message": "Goodbye [de]",     "description": "The word 'Goodbye', to appear in the main window."   } }  Changing the locale to de results in what’s shown in Figure 6-18, which is good enough for testing.  Figure 6-18. An app localized for ersatz German  There are a few more features of the i18n API that I didn’t cover here; if you’d like more information, see the chrome.i18n documentation for the full treatment.  Internationalizing Numbers Numbers can be handled with ECMAScript  what standard JavaScript is called  facili‐ ties, not unique to Chrome Apps. I’ll give the highlights here, and you can read all the details at the ECMAScript Internationalization API. Countries vary in whether they use commas to group digits and a period to mark the decimal point, or vice versa. The simplest way to format a decimal number for the  212      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   current locale is to construct a Number object and call its toLocaleString method, like this:  var num = new Number 1234.56 ; var s = num.toLocaleString  ;  You can also explicitly choose the locale with an argument to toLocaleString:  function decimalNumbers   {     var num = new Number 1234.56 ;     console.log "Decimal format, user's language:", num.toLocaleString   ;     console.log "Decimal format, German:", num.toLocaleString "de"  ; }  Figure 6-19 illustrates what appears on the console.  Figure 6-19. A number localized for English and German  For currency, toLocaleString takes a second argument that indicates the currency. For the current locale, you need to supply an explicit argument. You can get the current locale by using navigator.language  see also Figure 6-20 :  function currencyNumbers   {     var lang = navigator.language;     var num = new Number 1234.56 ;     console.log "Currency format, pound sterling, user's language:",       num.toLocaleString lang, {style: "currency", currency: "GBP"}  ;     console.log "Currency format, pound sterling, German:",       num.toLocaleString "de", {style: "currency", currency: "GBP"}  ; }  Figure 6-20. A number in pounds sterling localized for English and German  You can also handle percent  see also Figure 6-21 :  function percentNumbers   {     var lang = navigator.language;     var num = new Number 1234.56 ;     console.log "Percent format, user's language:",       num.toLocaleString lang, {style: "percent"}  ;     console.log "Percent format, German:",       num.toLocaleString "de", {style: "percent"}  ; }  Internationalization and Localization      213  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure 6-21. Percentage localized for English and German  Internationalizing Dates There  are  only  a  couple  of  ways  to  represent  numbers  in  any  locale   $1234.56  or $1,234.56, for US English , but there are numerous ways to represent dates: 6 12 14, 6 12 2014, June 12 2014, 12-June-2014, 2014-06-12, 2014 June 12, 12 June 2014, and 2014-June-12 are all the same date. Add time, and it gets worse: you can have 12-hour or 24-hour time, with various forms of A.M. P.M. notations, a time zone expressed as letters  for example, MST  or a time offset, and so on. So, even without any attempt at localization, dates and times are messy. With localiza‐ tion, they’re messier. You can handle dates, like numbers, by using ECMAScript standard facilities. You can go to the ECMAScript Internationalization API documentation for more detail than I’ll present here. At first, things seem easy—all you do is the following:  var d = new Date "2014-06-12" ; console.log "Local time, user's language:", d.toLocaleString lang  ; console.log "Local time, German:", d.toLocaleString "de"  ;  Figure 6-22 reveals what you get.  Figure 6-22. A date localized in default format for English and German  There are three problems here:    A time is shown even though none was specified.   The ambiguous format MM DD YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY is used, even though I have my computer set to use the format YYYY-MM-DD. It seems that Chrome ignores the computer’s date-format setting.    The date seems to be wrong!  The  seemingly  wrong  date  was  caused  by  2014-06-12  being  interpreted  as 2014-06-12T00:00:00-00:00  midnight, UTC  and then being translated to Mountain Daylight Time, which moves it six hours backward to 6 P.M. on 11-June-2013.  214      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info   You can solve the shifting-date problem easily by passing a time-zone option to toLo caleString, one of several options it takes as its second argument. The principal ones are listed in Table 6-1. Table 6-1. toLocaleString options Option timeZone  Values UTC or an IANA time-zone name  see iana.org time-zones , such as America Denver or Eu rope Bucharest Whether to use 12-hour time; true or false narrow, short, long narrow, short, long numeric, 2-digit numeric, 2-digit, nar row, short, long numeric, 2-digit numeric, 2-digit numeric, 2-digit numeric, 2-digit short, long  hour12  weekday  era  year  month  day  hour  minute  second  timeZone Name  and:  Because the options are properties of an object, you can’t specify the order. For instance:  {year: "numeric", month: "numeric", day: "numeric"}  {year: "numeric", day: "numeric", month: "numeric"}  are the same. Here are some examples:  var d = new Date "2014-06-12T12:00:00-00:00" ; var options1 = {     year: "numeric",     month: "long",     day: "numeric" }; console.log "Local date, user's language:", d.toLocaleString lang, options1  ; console.log "Local date, German:", d.toLocaleString "de", options1  ; var options2 = {     year: "numeric",     month: "short",  Internationalization and Localization      215  www.it-ebooks.info       day: "numeric",     hour: "2-digit",     minute: "2-digit",     second: "2-digit",     timeZone: "America Denver",     timeZoneName: "short" }; console.log "Local date, user's language:", d.toLocaleString lang, options2  ; console.log "Local date, German:", d.toLocaleString "de", options2  ;  The console output is shown in Figure 6-23.  Figure 6-23. Example dates localized for English and German  Here’s a function to provide a date in the global YYYY-MM-DD format without using toLocaleString at all. Note that the Date methods it does call all return results in the local time zone:  function getDateLocal d  {     return d.getFullYear   + "-" +  101 + d.getMonth   .toString  .slice -2  +       "-" +  100 + d.getDate   .toString  .slice -2 ; }  var d = new Date "2014-06-12T12:00:00-00:00" ; console.log "Local date, YYYY-MM-DD:", getDateLocal d  ;  Figure 6-24 displays the output.  Figure 6-24. A date in global format  I like to write dates in the form DD-MMM-YYYY, where MMM is the month in English, because it’s a little more readable to most people than the YYYY-MM-DD format, and because there’s no ambiguity. Even though I write the month name in English, most people can recognize at least month names in English, even if they’re not fluent speakers. Following is a function to return the local date with a spelled-out month, localized by the computer, even though I don’t know the month names in any language but my own:  function getDateLocalLongMonth d, lang  {     if  !lang          lang = navigator.language;     var month = d.toLocaleString lang, {month: "long"} ;  216      Chapter 6: Miscellaneous APIs  www.it-ebooks.info       return d.getDate  .toString   + "-" + month + "-" + d.getFullYear  ; }  var d = new Date "2014-06-12T12:00:00-00:00" ; console.log "Local date, DD-MMM-YYYY:", getDateLocalLongMonth d  ; console.log "Local date, German, DD-MMM-YYYY:", getDateLocalLongMonth d, "de"  ;  Figure 6-25 depicts the resulting output.  Figure 6-25. A date with month localized for English and German Chapter Summary This final chapter included a bunch of miscellaneous APIs for alarms, context menus, location, text-to-speech, system queries, the camera, hardware interfaces  Bluetooth, USB, and serial , and internationalization.  Chapter Summary      217  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX A Modal Dialogs  As is pointed out in Chapter 1, you can’t call the usual JavaScript alert and confirm dialogs in a Chrome App  they’re undefined . But, with the new HTML5   tag, it’s easy to build modal dialogs using only standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before Chrome 37 introduced the   tag, the way to implement a dialog was to define a   element in HTML that completely covered the window, both disabling all user-interface components in the window  making the dialog modal  and partially obscuring the window, making it look disabled. Then, the dialog itself was shown in front with any user-interface components it needed. Now, this complexity is unneces‐ sary. Figure A-1 shows the example app we’ll use in this appendix.  Figure A-1. The app’s initial window with two buttons  219  www.it-ebooks.info   Clicking the button on the left displays an alert dialog, as illustrated in Figure A-2.  Figure A-2. An alert dialog  Clicking anywhere outside the dialog does nothing. Clicking the OK button dismisses the dialog and restores the original screen. Then, clicking the right button at the top pops up the confirm dialog in Figure A-3. Clicking Yes shows the alert in Figure A-4. Clicking No shows an analogous alert. All you need to do to implement a dialog is to add a   tag to the body:             You show the dialog modally by using the JavaScript showModal method and dismiss it with close. By default, a dialog is pretty plain. The more attractive dialogs shown in the examples use this CSS:  dlg-dialog {     border: 1px solid rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ;     border-radius: 6px;     box-shadow: 0 3px 7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ; }  220     Appendix A: Modal Dialogs  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure A-3. The confirm dialog  Figure A-4. Alert dialog after clicking the Yes button  The method that’s called to show the dialog adds additional HTML within the <dia log> element, which is what displayed the messages and buttons in the previous exam‐ ples. We’re going to see that soon.  Modal Dialogs      221  www.it-ebooks.info   It’s most convenient if all of the code for these dialogs, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is placed in a single JavaScript file. That way, all you have to do is add a   tag to your HTML, without adding anything else and, especially, without actually adding HTML for the dialog. This is done by creating HTML and CSS for the dialogs dynamically in JavaScript. The JavaScript for the dialog should also be a module so that any internal functions it uses are hidden.  See “Modules and Module Loading” on page 86.  For dialogs, the JavaScript for the module is in a file named Dialogs.js and looks like this:  var Dialogs =  function    {     return {         alert: function  msg  {                put up the alert dialog         },          confirm: function msg, btnYes, btnNo, actionYes, actionNo  {                put up the confirm dialog         }     }      function internal_function1   {            ...     }      function internal_function2   {            ...     } }   ;  The alert method takes a message argument, and the confirm method takes that and four additional arguments for the names of the buttons and the callback functions if either of those buttons is clicked. The code that follows is for the example program and shows you how to use those methods. First is the index.html file, referenced when the background.js code created the window, just as in all the previous Chrome App examples:                   Dialog Example                         Show Alert Dialog...       Show Confirm Dialog...       222     Appendix A: Modal Dialogs  www.it-ebooks.info   Observe the   reference to Dialogs.js, which contains the Dialogs module. We’ll get to that shortly. Here’s the example program in DialogExample.js:  window.onload = function    {     document.querySelector "alert" .addEventListener "click",         function    {             Dialogs.alert "This is the alert." ;         }      ;     document.querySelector "confirm" .addEventListener "click",         function    {             Dialogs.confirm "Click one of the buttons:", "Yes", "No",                 function    {                     Dialogs.alert "You clicked Yes" ;                 },                 function    {                     Dialogs.alert "You clicked No" ;                 }              ;         }      ; };  Of interest here are the calls to the two methods,  Dialogs.alert and  Dialogs.con firm, and the two callbacks for the latter, which also call Dialogs.alert. Now, going back to the module in Dialogs.js, it has an internal function that adds the needed HTML and CSS to the body:  function setup   {     if  !document.querySelector "dlg-dialog"   {         dlg = document.createElement "dialog" ;         dlg.id = 'dlg-dialog';         document.body.appendChild dlg ;         var css = document.createElement "style" ;         css.type = "text css";         css.innerHTML =             "dlg-dialog {" +             "    border: 1px solid rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ;" +             "    border-radius: 6px;" +             "    box-shadow: 0 3px 7px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ;" +             "}";         document.body.appendChild css ;     } }  The code is a little hard to follow, but if you study it, you’ll see that all it does is add the HTML and CSS we saw previously to the document. It first tests to see if it’s already added, so it’s set up only once.  Modal Dialogs      223  www.it-ebooks.info   Here is the method for alert, which was sketched in the preceding module example:  alert: function  msg  {     dialog " " + msg + "  OK ",         [             {                 id: 'dlg-close'             }         ]      ; },  This method calls the internal dialog function with two arguments:    HTML for the dialog, which in this case is the message with a button underneath  it    An array with an element for each button, each of which consists of the id for that  button and an action, the default being to simply close the dialog  The method for confirm is a little more involved because it has two buttons and actions:  confirm: function msg, btnYes, btnNo, actionYes, actionNo  {     dialog        " " + msg + "  " + btnNo + " " +       " " + btnYes + " ",         [             {                 id: "dlg-no",                 action: actionNo             },             {                 id: "dlg-yes",                 action: actionYes             }         ]      ; }  Here’s the internal dialog function that does most of the work:  function dialog html, actions  {     setup  ;     dlg.innerHTML = html;     dlg.showModal  ;     var funcs = [];     for  var i = 0; i < actions.length; i++  {         funcs[i] =  function index  {             return function   {    index bound here instead to function dialog                 dlg.close  ;                 if  actions[index].action                      actions[index].action  ;             }  224     Appendix A: Modal Dialogs  www.it-ebooks.info           }  i ;         document.getElementById actions[i].id .addEventListener "click", funcs[i] ;     } }  The first three lines are straightforward: they call setup to add the HTML and CSS if they’re not already added, set the supplied HTML  the first argument to dialog  as the inner HTML for the dialog, and then show it modally. The tricky part is setting up handlers for the buttons, each handler stored as an element of the funcs array. The obvious way to do that is like this:  for  var i = 0; i < actions.length; i++  {     document.getElementById actions[i].id .addEventListener "click",         function    {             dlg.close  ;             if  actions[i].action     i is bound to function dialog                 actions[i].action  ;         }      ; }  But, this won’t work because  as the comment indicates  the variable i is bound to the dialog function, not to the event-handling function. Its value when the event handler is called will be whatever the for loop set it to when it terminated  perhaps 3 . To fix this problem, you must call a function to set each element of func to the event-handler function, which gets the index bound to that intermediate function, unique to each button, instead of to the outer dialog function. That’s what’s done in the dialog func‐ tion.  This is a trick you’ll want to use whenever you’re having this sort of function- closure problem.  After dialog is implemented, you can add any number of customized methods in ad‐ dition to alert and confirm.  Modal Dialogs      225  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX B Registering Chrome Apps with Google  Before a Chrome App can access Google APIs, you must register it with Google. Reg‐ istration is documented by Google  read the “User Authentication” section , but as of October 2014, the Google Developers Console user interface has been updated, and the step-by-step instructions are out whack with what the website does. What follows here works as of this writing, but be warned that it might change again by the time you read it. Registering a Chrome App and Getting a Client ID To register your Chrome App and obtain a client ID, you need to do the following:  1. Go to the Google Developers Console. 2. Click the Create Project button. In the New Project window that opens, type the  project name and then click the Create button, as shown in Figure B-1.  Figure B-1. Creating a new project  227  www.it-ebooks.info   3. In the Developers Console, in the “APIs & auth” section, click APIs and turn on any APIs your app needs. For the example in “Accessing Google APIs” on page 106, this would be Drive API, as shown in Figure B-2.  A few others are also enabled by default.   Figure B-2. Enabling the Drive API  4. Again, in the “APIs & auth” section, click Credentials and then click CREATE NEW CLIENT ID under OAuth. In the dialog box that opens, click the “Installed appli‐ cation” radio button and then Chrome Application. Enter the app ID and click Create Client ID, as shown in Figure B-3.  See “Fixing the App ID” on page 230 to see how to establish a fixed app ID.   5. The client ID displays, as shown in Figure B-4. 6. Copy the client ID and update your manifest with OAuth2 client ID and scopes:  {    "app": {       "background": {          "scripts": [ "background.js" ]       }    },    "manifest_version": 2,    "name": "GDrive",    "version": "1.0.0",     "permissions": [         "identity"     ],  228     Appendix B: Registering Chrome Apps with Google  www.it-ebooks.info       "key": "MIIBIjANB...yyltEwIDAQAB",     "oauth2": {         "client_id": "2546277...3kj.apps.googleusercontent.com",         "scopes": [             "https:  www.googleapis.com auth drive"         ]     } }  Figure B-3. Creating a client ID  Figure B-4. New client ID is displayed  7. On  the  first  call  to  chrome.identity.getAuthToken   see  “Accessing  Google APIs”  on  page  106 ,  you  are  asked  to  confirm  the  permissions,  as  shown  in Figure B-5.  Registering a Chrome App and Getting a Client ID      229  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure B-5. Authorizing the app  Fixing the App ID Generally, while you’re developing a Chrome App you’ll load it in unpacked form by clicking the “Load unpacked extension” button on the Extensions page, as described in Chapter 1. That causes an app ID to be assigned to the app, but then if you install the app, either by dropping a .crx file onto the Extensions page or downloading it from the Chrome Web Store, a different app ID will be assigned. If you go back to developing the app as unpacked, you might get the earlier app ID, or perhaps even a different one. Usually you don’t care what the app ID is, but when you register an app, you need to supply a specific app ID, and it’s annoying if it changes because you have to keep updating the app’s registration and getting a new client ID. It’s much easier to fix the app ID so that it never changes during development. Here’s what you do:  1. Early in the app’s development, on the Extensions page, pack it by clicking “Pack  extension,” which generates a .crx file, as shown in Figure B-6.  2. If you have an unpacked version of the new app loaded, unload it by clicking the  trashcan icon.  3. Install the packed extension by dragging the .crx file to the Extensions page. Verify that the app is installed and runs by clicking its “launch” link on the Extensions page.  It may no longer be at the top of the page, so scroll down until you find it.   230     Appendix B: Registering Chrome Apps with Google  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure B-6. Packing a Chrome App  4. Find the manifest.json file stored inside Chrome  not the one you used for devel‐ opment . Begin by using the Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, or whatever your system offers to navigate to the user data directory. Instructions for finding it are at the Chromium Project’s User Data Directory page. For example, on Mac OS X it’s  at  ~ Library Application  Support Google Chrome Default,  and  on  Windows Vista,  7,  or  8  it’s  at  C:\Users\ \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User  Data \Default, where   is your username.  5. On the Extensions page, find the app ID, as shown in Figure B-7.  Figure B-7. Getting the app ID from the Extensions page  Fixing the App ID      231  www.it-ebooks.info   6. Find  the  corresponding  directory  in  the  user  data  directory,  as  shown  in  Figure B-8, and navigate down to the installed manifest.json file.  Figure B-8. Finding the manifest.json file in the installed App folder  7. Copy the  key property from the installed manifest and paste it into the mani‐ fest.json file in your development source. With the key in place there, Chrome will always use the same app ID, whether the app is loaded as unpacked or installed. You can then use that app ID when you register the app, and you no longer need to worry about it changing. Accordingly, the client ID will be permanently fixed, as well.  You will have to remove the key property before you upload the app to the Chrome Web Store, and you may get a different app ID then.   232     Appendix B: Registering Chrome Apps with Google  www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX C Using Google Cloud Messaging  “Google Cloud Messaging” on page 114 explains how to code a Chrome App to receive messages from Google Cloud Messaging  GCM . You can see the overall architecture in Figure 4-10. This appendix explains how to set up a GCM project, how to code an example app server to communicate with GCM, and how to send GCM messages from Amazon Simple Notification Service. Nothing here is particular to Chrome Apps; ev‐ erything would work equally well with Android apps or any other app using GCM. Setting Up a GCM Project 1. Go to the Google Developers Console. You’ll need a Google account if you don’t  already have one, but as of this writing, you don’t need to establish billing.  2. Click the Create Project button. In the New Project window that opens, type the  project name and then click the Create button, as shown in Figure C-1.  Figure C-1. Creating a new project  233  www.it-ebooks.info   3. After  a  pause,  the  window  will  refresh  to  show  the  project  number   see Figure C-2 , which you should copy and paste into the background.js file of the Chrome App so that it can be passed to chrome.gcm.register as the sender ID  the code is shown in “Example Client” on page 116 .  For Android and other apps, you would do things differently, but you’ll still need the registration ID.   Figure C-2. The project number for the new app  4. In the “APIs & auth” section, click APIs and then turn on Google Cloud Messaging for Android  Figure C-3 . Do not turn on Google Cloud Messaging for Chrome; that is for the older chrome.pushMessaging API. Some other APIs will be turned on, as well, as shown in Figure C-3, but that’s OK.  Figure C-3. Google Cloud Messaging for Android turned on  5. Again, in the “APIs & auth” section, click Credentials. In the “Public API access” section, click CREATE NEW PAGE and then click “Server key” to get the dialog shown in Figure C-4. Click Create to create the API key. You can leave the IP- addresses field blank if you want.  234     Appendix C: Using Google Cloud Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure C-4. Creating a server key  API key   6. Copy the displayed API key  see Figure C-5  and paste it into the server script shown in “Example App Server” on page 235  or whatever server app you’ve developed . The app server will need this to communicate with the GCM Connection Server.  Figure C-5. The API key  This completes the app and project registration with the Google Developers Console, because all you need is the project number  with Google Cloud Messaging for Android turned on  and the API key. Example App Server There are several ways to communicate with the GCM Connection Server to send a message, all of them described at developer.android.com google gcm.  As of March 2014, this page refers only to Android, not to Chrome Apps, but what’s said there does apply to the chrome.gcm API discussed in “Google Cloud Messaging” on page 114.   Example App Server      235  www.it-ebooks.info   Here I’ll show a PHP script, because PHP is supported by almost all application servers you’re likely to use, it’s simple to use, and it’s understood by most web programmers.  More than 80 percent of websites use it.  If you want, you can write your server in Java, Python, JavaScript  running under Node.js , or any other server-side language. It will still communicate with the GCM Connection Server via HTTP, which all server-side languages support. Most of the work in the example server isn’t related to GCM—it’s to get some interesting data to send to the Chrome App. For that, it accesses the New York MTA Bus Time server. This service is free, but you’ll need to get an MTA API key  not to be confused with the GCM API key . There are now three servers, so it’s a good idea to redraw Figure 4-10, which I’ve done in Figure C-6, to show that the app server communicates with the MTA Bus Time server to get bus statuses.  Figure C-6. Our example Application Server communicates with two other servers  I won’t go into the MTA Bus Time API, of course, except to say that you can get the status of the bus stop at 5th Avenue and 46 47th Street  stop 400516  by using this HTTP query  spread across two lines for readability :  http:  api.prod.obanyc.com api siri stop-monitoring.json ?key= &MonitoringRef=400516  The result comes back as a complex object  converted from JSON to a PHP object, as we’ll see , which you have to study to find the relevant data—in this case, only the buses within one stop of 46 47th Street.  As all New Yorkers know, 5th Avenue is one-way south, so all buses go the same direction.  After data is extracted from the returned object, a typical status message looks like this:  12:45:50 -- M4 at stop; M4 1 stop away@5 AV WEST 47 - 46 ST  236     Appendix C: Using Google Cloud Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   That message is then sent to the GCM Connection Server, also via HTTP, as we’re about to see. Recall from “Google Cloud Messaging” on page 114 that a Chrome App that wants to receive GCM messages must send its registration ID to the server. The server, in gcmv2- bus.php, checks for the presence of a regID query parameter and, if it’s nonempty, saves the registration ID in the regID-bus.data file. If the parameter is missing, the server begins broadcasting status messages. Here’s the first part of the PHP code:  define 'REG_ID_FILE', 'regID-bus.data' ; define 'API_KEY', 'AIzaSy...CaqPk' ; define 'MTA_KEY', '91474b6...3f95' ;  $url = "http:  api.prod.obanyc.com api siri stop-monitoring.json?key=" .   MTA_KEY . "&MonitoringRef=400516";  if  !empty $_REQUEST['regid']       store_regID $_REQUEST['regid'] ; else     broadcast  ;  function get_regIDs   {     if  file_exists REG_ID_FILE           return unserialize file_get_contents REG_ID_FILE  ;     return array  ; }  function store_regID $regID  {     $a = get_regIDs  ;     $a[$regID] = 1;     file_put_contents REG_ID_FILE, serialize $a  ; }  If you don’t know PHP, the details aren’t important, but you do need to know that the get_regIDs function returns an array of registration IDs to which messages are to be sent. The broadcast function queries the MTA Bus Time server every 15 seconds:  function broadcast   {     $num_sent = 0;     for  $n = 0; $n < 20;   {         $regIDs = '';         foreach  get_regIDs   as $k => $v              $regIDs .= ',"' . $k . '"';         $regIDs = substr $regIDs, 1 ;         if  send_message API_KEY, $regIDs               $n++;         sleep 15 ;     } }  Example App Server      237  www.it-ebooks.info   It gets a fresh array of registration IDs each time, too, in case a client registered while it was looping.  Such registration would invoke a different execution of the script, but I didn’t bother programming any locks to prevent simultaneous access to the file of reg‐ istration IDs.  The code at the start of the for loop assembles the registration IDs into a comma-separated list, which is what send_message needs, something like this:  "APA91bHSH-NzFPIZvl15B", "APA91bFxX-lplMoOtpuNw", "APA91bGNU-yNCMkeK1PQu"  In working out this example server, I somehow got a couple of serv‐ er instances running on the server computer with no way to kill them because they were running on a shared host on which I have very limited permissions. That’s why the app is designed to terminate af‐ ter 20 statuses are sent; a real server would keep running until it’s terminated,  perhaps  with  a  separate  management  utility,  but  that’s overkill for a book example.  Here’s the send_message function, which does one query of the MTA Bus Time server and sends the message to the GCM Connection Server, but only if the message is non‐ empty  there is a bus within one stop  and it’s different from the last message sent:  function send_message $apiKey, $regIDs  {     global $url;     global $prev;      $response = send_request false, $url,       array "Content-Type: application json"  ;     $x = json_decode $response ;     $sd = $x->Siri->ServiceDelivery;     $rt = $sd->ResponseTimestamp;     $msv = $sd->StopMonitoringDelivery[0]->MonitoredStopVisit;     $s = '';     foreach  $msv as $k => $v  {         $mvj = $v->MonitoredVehicleJourney;         $dist = $mvj->MonitoredCall->Extensions->Distances->PresentableDistance;         $stopName = $mvj->MonitoredCall->StopPointName;         switch  $dist  {         case 'at stop':         case 'approaching':         case '1 stop away':             $s .= "; {$mvj->PublishedLineName} {$dist}";         }     }     if  !empty $s  && $s != $prev  {         $prev = $s;         $msg = substr $rt, 11, 8  . " -- " . substr $s, 2  . "@$stopName";         echo " $msg";  238     Appendix C: Using Google Cloud Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info           $data = <<<EOT             {                 "data": {                     "message": "$msg"                 },                 "registration_ids": [$regIDs],                 "delay_while_idle": true,                 "time_to_live": 600             } EOT;         send_request true, "https:  android.googleapis.com gcm send",           array "Content-Type: application json", "Authorization: key=$apiKey" ,           $data ;     } }  Expressions such as $mvj->MonitoredCall->StopPointName in the code refer to sub- objects within the object returned by the MTA Bus Time server.  It took me an hour or so of playing around to figure out where the data was that I wanted.  If the status is to be sent  !empty $s  && $s != $prev , it’s prefixed with the time, suffixed with the stop name, and then sent to the GCM Connection Server as part of a data object that also includes the array of registration IDs. Finally, send_request uses cURL to send HTTP requests by using GET or POST:  function send_request $post, $url, $headers, $postText = null  {     $ch = curl_init  ;     curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers ;     curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url ;     curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_POST, $post ;     curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true ;     if  $postText          curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postText ;     $response = curl_exec $ch ;     curl_close $ch ;     return $response; }  For uploading registration IDs, this PHP file is executed from the Chrome App’s back‐ ground.js page, as we saw in “Example Client” on page 116:  function sendRegistrationID registrationID  {        Should use https     Ajax.ajaxSend "http:  basepath.com servers gcmv2-bus.php?regid=" +       registrationID, 'json',         function  status, response  {             if  status == 200                  chrome.storage.local.set                      {                         registered: true                     }                  ;  Example App Server      239  www.it-ebooks.info               else                 console.log 'Error sending registrationID' ;         }      ; }  For  broadcasting,  I  just  executed  the  server  from  a  web  browser,  as  shown  in Figure C-7. That’s OK for an example, but for a real application you’d want to start the app server directly from the web server, perhaps by using cron.  Figure C-7. Starting the app server from a browser Using Amazon Simple Notification Service If you just want to test a GCM-receiving Chrome App without going to the trouble of developing an app server, you can send messages directly with Amazon Simple Notifi‐ cation Service  SNS .  Interestingly, as of this writing Google doesn’t have a similar feature.  Here’s what you do:  1. If you don’t already have one, set up an Amazon Web Services  AWS  account at aws.amazon.com. You might need to establish a billing account, but the cost for sending a few messages is either free or only pennies, so don’t worry about it.  2. Go to the SNS console and click the “Add a New App” menu item. Give the app a name  see Figure C-8 , choose GCM as the Push Platform, and enter the GCM API key that you got from the Google Developers Console  not from Amazon .  3. When the app is created, click the Add Endpoints button and enter the registration  ID from a Chrome App, as shown in Figure C-9.  There’s probably an API for uploading the registration ID di‐ rectly from the Chrome App, but I didn’t bother. I just copied it from the regID-bus.data used by the PHP app server and pas‐ ted  it  into  the  SNS  dialog.  Or,  you  could  use  console.log  to display it from the Chrome App and copy it from there. Note that SNS refers to the registration ID as a Device Token.  240     Appendix C: Using Google Cloud Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure C-8. Creating a new SNS app  Figure C-9. Creating an SNS endpoint  4. After the endpoint is created, check it and click the Publish under Endpoint Actions menu item. Type a message, as demonstrated in Figure C-10, and click the Publish Message button to send the message.  Using Amazon Simple Notification Service      241  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure C-10. Publishing a message with SNS  5. Because the message I typed came from SNS, not the GCM Connection Server, it wasn’t formatted as the Chrome App expected it to be  no message property , so the app didn’t know what to do with it. Nonetheless, the console for the background script proves that it arrived, as illustrated in Figure C-11.  Figure C-11. Console log from Chrome App showing a message  242     Appendix C: Using Google Cloud Messaging  www.it-ebooks.info   APPENDIX D Using Cordova to Build Chrome Apps for Mobile Devices  Apache Cordova is a layer of software that provides HTML and JavaScript support so that an app written using those technologies can run under a native operating system. Of course, any modern browser can do that already, but Cordova provides the wrapping in the form of a native app, so the user who installs and uses it sees it as a native app. Google’s Augmentation of Cordova Google has added plug-ins to Cordova that implement the Chrome APIs, as shown in Figure D-1.  Figure D-1. Cordova layers  243  www.it-ebooks.info   Not all APIs are supported, although support is widening as time goes on. To see the current state of affairs, check the Mobile Chrome Apps page and the list of supported APIs. Even though Cordova runs your app on Android or iOS, you can’t call any native An‐ droid or iOS APIs if you still want your app to run on Chrome—you can use only Chrome and HTML APIs. Development Tools and Debugging for Cordova Mobile devices ranging from phones to fairly large tablets have two important differ‐ ences relative to desktop or laptop computers that will affect your user interface design:    The screen is usually smaller—for phones, much smaller. You need a layout that works on all screen sizes, or you can use CSS to implement a so-called “responsive” interface that adapts to the screen size. There’s lots of information on the web about how to do that; just search for “responsive css” to find it.    Users usually operate the interface with their relatively large fingertips instead of a precise mouse pointer. So, buttons and other controls must be accordingly bigger. You can handle that with responsive CSS too, if you want, or just make the controls big on all devices.  The other major issue with Cordova is that not all the Chrome APIs are implemented, as I already mentioned.  Creating and Testing Cordova Chrome Apps Because Google’s tools and documentation for building Chrome Apps for Cordova are very new and somewhat complex, I won’t go into all the details here, but I will sketch it out in general. Testing under the Android and iOS emulators is easy, but things get complicated when you’re ready to publish your app on the stores  Google Play or Apple’s App Store , so you should consult the latest documentation at the Mobile Chrome Apps website. The following discussion assumes that you’ve installed all the Android and or iOS Cor‐ dova tools, including, if you need them, Java, Xcode  Apple’s developer tools , and the Android and or iOS emulators.  Step-by-step instructions are on the Mobile Chrome Apps website.  My examples all use the cca  Cordova Chrome App  command-line tool. You can also develop by using the Eclipse IDE or with Android Studio, but I won’t show examples of those approaches. To construct a Cordova app, you begin with a Chrome App built to run under Chrome. That is, at a minimum it has a manifest, a background page, an HTML page, and a JavaScript file all in an app folder, as we’ve already seen in several examples.  244     Appendix D: Using Cordova to Build Chrome Apps for Mobile Devices  www.it-ebooks.info   Next,  you  run  this  command  in  a  terminal  window  or  shell  to  construct  the Cordova app:  cca create   --link-to=   In this example,   is the name of the folder to be created to hold the mobile app, and   is a path to the existing app folder. The cca command creates a new folder named   that contains code for the native app, and also a subfolder named www that links to the existing  . That way Chrome-targeted code and the Cordova-targeted code are shared, and any changes to one are reflected in the other. For  example,  suppose  that  you  have  an  app  folder  named  Hello  that  implements  a Chrome App that runs in Chrome. You would change to its parent folder and run cca create, getting something like this:  $ cca create Hello-mobile --link-to=Hello cca v0.0.3  Checking that tools are installed Android SDK detected. Xcode detected. Searching for Chrome app source in  Users marc examples 02-developing cca Hello  Creating Your Application create Hello-mobile Hello Hello Writing config.xml Changing directory to:  Users marc examples 02-developing cca Hello-mobile platform add ios platform add android plugin add org.apache.cordova.file plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser plugin add org.apache.cordova.network-information plugin add org.apache.cordova.keyboard plugin add org.apache.cordova.statusbar plugin add org.chromium.navigation plugin add org.chromium.bootstrap plugin add org.chromium.i18n plugin add org.chromium.polyfill.CustomEvent plugin add org.chromium.polyfill.xhr_features plugin add org.chromium.polyfill.blob_constructor prepare Done!  Your project has been created, with the following symlink:  Users marc examples 02-developing cca Hello-mobile www -->  Users marc examples 02-developing cca Hello  Remember to run +cca prepare+ after making changes  full instructions: http:  goo.gl iCaCFG . $  Development Tools and Debugging for Cordova      245  www.it-ebooks.info   This gets you more than 600 files in dozens of subfolders of Hello-mobile that provide Android and iOS native apps for the Chrome App, including lots of Java  for Android  and Objective-C code  for iOS . You don’t need to know what those files do or mess with them in any way. Your Chrome App source code is in there, too, but because its folder is linked to the app folder you already have, you can work there, as you’ve already been doing. To run the Cordova app on an emulator, you change to the Cordova folder, Hello- mobile in this case, and execute either:  cca emulate android  or:  cca emulate ios  Either command will open the corresponding emulator in which you can test your app, as shown in Figure D-2.  Figure D-2. An app running on Android and iOS emulators  After you make changes to the app, you update the generated Cordova wrapper with the following:  246     Appendix D: Using Cordova to Build Chrome Apps for Mobile Devices  www.it-ebooks.info   cca prepare  You then test it again by using the cca emulate command.  Debugging Cordova Apps Because Cordova doesn’t yet have anything as powerful as Developer Tools for Chrome, it’s best to do as much debugging as possible under Chrome before you build and test the app for a mobile platform. You can at least see the console log when you’re testing on the Android emulator. With the emulator running, execute the following:  adb -e logcat -v time chromium:V *:S  The -v time part puts the time onto the log, and the chromium:V *:S part filters the log so that you see only lines pertaining to Chromium. I haven’t located any instructions for viewing the log when you’re using the iOS emulator, but perhaps they’ll be available by the time you read this.  Publishing Cordova Chrome Apps You publish Android-targeted Chrome Apps on Google Play, and iOS-targeted apps on the Apple App Store. Both require that you first create developer accounts. Without getting too much into the details—which are still evolving as I write this—for both platforms you first create a release package with one of these two commands:  cca build android --release cca build ios --release  Then, you take the resulting build and submit it to the store using the procedures es‐ tablished by Google and or Apple. For an iOS app, you’ll probably want your own splash screen, which is shown briefly while the app launches. You can replace the default splash screens with your own. The cca create command places them in the platforms ios   Resources splash folder, where   is the name that appeared in the manifest. For example, these are the files that were supplied when I created the Hello app that we saw earlier:  Default-568h@2x~iphone.png Default-Landscape@2x~ipad.png Default-Landscape~ipad.png Default-Portrait@2x~ipad.png Default-Portrait~ipad.png Default@2x~iphone.png Default~iphone.png  If you’re curious, Default-Landscape~ipad.png is in Figure D-3.  Development Tools and Debugging for Cordova      247  www.it-ebooks.info   Figure D-3. The default iPad landscape splash screen  Testing Using the Chrome Dev Editor The Chrome Dev Editor  introduced in “Using the Chrome Dev Editor” on page 6  makes it especially easy to test mobile apps on Android, because it bypasses all of the tedious cca steps described earlier in this appendix.  It may also support iOS someday.  First, you need to install the Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile  CADT  on your Android device. As of this writing, it’s not available on Google Play, but you can get it from the CADT repository on GitHub. To install it, follow the “Using a Pre-Built Binary” installation instructions on that page. However, if you access the page from your An‐ droid device, the APK will install directly; it’s not necessary  or possible  to run the adb command as the instructions say. Connect your Android device to the computer that’s running the Chrome Dev Editor  USB is easiest  and start the CADT. Then, from the Chrome Dev Editor menu, choose Deploy to Mobile; you should see your app running on your Android device. It’s not possible to produce an APK file with the Chrome Dev Editor or with the CADT, so they’re just for testing. To publish your application, you must create the APK using the steps presented in “Publishing Cordova Chrome Apps” on page 247.  248     Appendix D: Using Cordova to Build Chrome Apps for Mobile Devices  www.it-ebooks.info   Index  A access tokens, 97 Ace code editor, 45 ActiveX, 12 Ajax, 94 Ajax function  JQuery , 95 Alarms API, 187–189 alert dialogs, 220 Amazon, 10 Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud  EC2 , 110 Amazon Simple Notification Service  SNS , 116,  240–242  Amazon Web Services  AWS , 240 Android  CADT for, 248 developing for, 243–248 emulator, 246 GCM and, 115  Android Studio, 244 API key, 120 App ID, 230–232 App Store  Apple , 244  publishing apps on, 247  app-to-app messaging, 121–123 app.background property  manifest.json , 3 Apple, 19  App Store, 244, 247 iOS emulator, 246  asynchronous calls, 25  database cursors and, 79  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  AJAX , 95 Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD  API,  88  auto-saving files, 32–34  timing, 33  B background page, 3 alarms and, 189 event pages vs., 4 handling events when app is inactive, 117 permissions and, 118  background.scripts property  Extensions , 10 backup features, adding, 50–54 Bellamy-Royds, Amelia, 150 Berkeley Software Distribution  BSD  Unix, 81 Beta release channel, 18 Bidelman, Eric, 23 blobs  as URLs, converting to images, 103 converting Canvases to, 146 saving PDFs as, 160 writing, 30  Bluetooth API, 202–207 device discovery, 205 documentation, 203  We’d like to hear your suggestions for improving our indexes.

worked for Bell Labs from 1970 to 1982, much of that time on parts of Unix, especially the Source Code Control System, for which he is well known. His 1985 book, Advanced UNIX Program‐ ming, was the first book that explained how to program the Unix kernel. Since leaving Bell Labs in 1982, Marc has had several management and nonmanagement positions in various software companies and done lots of consulting. In 1988, he started a venture- capital–backed company, XVT Software, that provided tools to enable programmers to develop portable GUI applications—the first such tool. Later, he was the vice president of software at two venture-capital–backed companies, one that produced an employee- scheduling product, and the other with an online-knowledge-base product. He has written three computer-related books: Expert PHP and MySQL: Application Design and Development  Apress, 2013 ; Advanced UNIX Programming, First and Sec‐ ond Edition  Prentice Hall, 1985; Addison-Wesley, 2004 ; and Advanced C Programming for Displays  Prentice-Hall, 1988 . He’s also written one novel, Bernie’s Bar & Girll. Currently, Marc develops iOS, Mac OS, Windows, and Chrome apps  listed at base‐ path.com ; does some consulting; and writes books. Colophon The animal on the cover of Programming Chrome Apps is a crested screamer. The crested screamer or southern screamer  Chauna torquata  lives in wetlands, estuaries, and swamps in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. This big bird weighs up to 11 pounds and can measure up to 3 feet long. The crested screamer is a nonmigratory bird that flocks in large groups. A couple will be monogamous, either seasonally or, more typically, for life. Both parents build a nest near water where they lay two to seven eggs in a clutch and incubate them together for 43 to 46 days. The fledging period for a young bird lasts 8 to 14 weeks. The crested screamer’s call is reported to be audible from a distance of up to two miles, a quality that gives this bird its name. It has air sacs under its skin that are believed to keep it warm. The birds’ unappetizing flavor and texture make them infrequent prey. Bony spurs of up to two inches in length on mature birds are located on the inner side of each wing; single males are known to use them to vie successfully for females, and both sexes use them to protect their territory and win fights with other couples. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world. To learn more about how you can help, go to animals.oreilly.com. The cover image is from Wood’s Illustrated Natural History. The cover fonts are URW Typewriter and Guardian Sans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.  www.it-ebooks.info
