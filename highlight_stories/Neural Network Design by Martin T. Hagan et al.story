neural network architectures and  learning rules. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical analysis of these  networks, on methods of training them and on their application to practical  engineering problems in such areas as nonlinear regression, pattern recog- nition, signal processing, data mining and control systems.  Every effort has been made to present material in a clear and consistent  manner so that it can be read and applied with ease. We have included  many solved problems to illustrate each topic of discussion. We have also  included a number of case studies in the final chapters to demonstrate  practical issues that arise when using neural networks on real world prob- lems.  Since this is a book on the design of neural networks, our choice of topics  was guided by two principles. First, we wanted to present the most useful  and practical neural network architectures, learning rules and training  techniques. Second, we wanted the book to be complete in itself and to flow  easily from one chapter to the next. For this reason, various introductory  materials and chapters on applied mathematics are included just before  they are needed for a particular subject. In summary, we have chosen some  topics because of their practical importance in the application of neural  networks, and other topics because of their importance in explaining how  neural networks operate.  We have omitted many topics that might have been included. We have not,  for instance, made this book a catalog or compendium of all known neural  network architectures and learning rules, but have instead concentrated  on the fundamental concepts. Second, we have not discussed neural net- work implementation technologies, such as VLSI, optical devices and par- allel computers. Finally, we do not present the biological and psychological  foundations of neural networks in any depth. These are all important top- ics, but we hope that we have done the reader a service by focusing on those  topics that we consider to be most useful in the design of neural networks  and by treating those topics in some depth.  This book has been organized for a one-semester introductory course in  neural networks at the senior or first-year graduate level.  It is also suit- able for short courses, self-study and reference.  The reader is expected to  have some background in linear algebra, probability and differential equa- tions.   P-1   Preface  2 2+  Each chapter of the book is divided into the following sections: Objectives,  Theory and Examples, Summary of Results, Solved Problems, Epilogue,  Further Reading and Exercises. The Theory and Examples section compris- es the main body of each chapter. It includes the development of fundamen- tal ideas as well as worked examples  indicated by the icon shown here in  the left margin . The Summary of Results section provides a convenient  listing of important equations and concepts and facilitates the use of the  book as an industrial reference. About a third of each chapter is devoted to  the Solved Problems section, which provides detailed examples for all key  concepts.   The following figure illustrates the dependencies among the chapters.  1  2  3  4  5  Introduction  Architectures  Illustrative  Example     Perceptron  Learning Rule  Signal and   Weight Vector   Spaces  Linear   6 Transformations   for Neural  Networks  Performance   8  Surfaces  Peformance  Optimization  Widrow-Hoff  9  10  11 Backpropagation  12 Variations on  Backpropagation  Generalization  13  14  Dynamic  Networks  Radial Basis   17  Networks  Supervised   7  Hebb  15  Associative  Learning  Competitive   16  Learning  Grossberg  18  19  20  21  ART  Stability  Hopfield  22 Practical Training  Case Study   23  Function   Approximation  24  Case Study  Probability  Estimation  25  Case Study   Pattern   Recognition  Case Study  Prediction  27  26  Case Study  Clustering  Chapters 1 through 6 cover basic concepts that are required for all of the  remaining chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the text, with a brief  historical background and some basic biology. Chapter 2 describes the ba-  P-2   sic neural network architectures. The notation that is introduced in this  chapter is used throughout the book. In Chapter 3 we present a simple pat- tern recognition problem and show how it can be solved using three differ- ent types of neural networks. These three networks are representative of  the types of networks that are presented in the remainder of the text. In  addition, the pattern recognition problem presented here provides a com- mon thread of experience throughout the book.  Much of the focus of this book will be on methods for training neural net- works to perform various tasks. In Chapter 4 we introduce learning algo- rithms and present the first practical algorithm: the perceptron learning  rule. The perceptron network has fundamental limitations, but it is impor- tant for historical reasons and is also a useful tool for introducing key con- cepts that will be applied to more powerful networks in later chapters.  One of the main objectives of this book is to explain how neural networks  operate. For this reason we will weave together neural network topics with  important introductory material. For example, linear algebra, which is the  core of the mathematics required for understanding neural networks, is re- viewed in Chapters 5 and 6. The concepts discussed in these chapters will  be used extensively throughout the remainder of the book.  Chapters 7, and 15–19 describe networks and learning rules that are  heavily inspired by biology and psychology. They fall into two categories:  associative networks and competitive networks. Chapters 7 and 15 intro- duce basic concepts, while Chapters 16–19 describe more advanced net- works.  Chapters 8–14 and 17 develop a class of learning called performance learn- ing, in which a network is trained to optimize its performance. Chapters 8  and 9 introduce the basic concepts of performance learning. Chapters 10– 13 apply these concepts to feedforward neural networks of increasing pow- er and complexity, Chapter 14 applies them to dynamic networks and  Chapter 17 applies them to radial basis networks, which also use concepts  from competitive learning.  Chapters 20 and 21 discuss recurrent associative memory networks. These  networks, which have feedback connections, are dynamical systems. Chap- ter 20 investigates the stability of these systems. Chapter 21 presents the  Hopfield network, which has been one of the most influential recurrent net- works.  Chapters 22–27 are different than the preceding chapters. Previous chap- ters focus on the fundamentals of each type of network and their learning  rules. The focus is on understanding the key concepts. In Chapters 22–27,  we discuss some practical issues in applying neural networks to real world  problems. Chapter 22 describes many practical training tips, and Chapters  23–27 present a series of case studies, in which neural networks are ap- plied to practical problems in function approximation, probability estima- tion, pattern recognition, clustering and prediction.  P-3   Preface  Software  » 2 + 2 ans =       4  MATLAB is not essential for using this book. The computer exercises can  be performed with any available programming language, and the Neural  Network Design Demonstrations, while helpful, are not critical to under- standing the material covered in this book.  However, we have made use of the MATLAB software package to supple- ment the textbook. This software is widely available and, because of its ma- trix vector notation and graphics, is a convenient environment in which to  experiment with neural networks. We use MATLAB in two different ways.  First, we have included a number of exercises for the reader to perform in  MATLAB. Many of the important features of neural networks become ap- parent only for large-scale problems, which are computationally intensive  and not feasible for hand calculations. With MATLAB, neural network al- gorithms can be quickly implemented, and large-scale problems can be  tested conveniently. These MATLAB exercises are identified by the icon  shown here to the left.  If MATLAB is not available, any other program- ming language can be used to perform the exercises.   The second way in which we use MATLAB is through the Neural Network  Design Demonstrations, which can be downloaded from the website        hagan.okstate.edu nnd.html. These interactive demonstrations illustrate  important concepts in each chapter. After the software has been loaded into  the MATLAB directory on your computer  or placed on the MATLAB path ,  it can be invoked by typing nnd at the MATLAB prompt. All  demonstrations are easily accessible from a master menu. The icon shown  here to the left identifies references to these demonstrations in the text.  The demonstrations require MATLAB or the student edition of MATLAB,  version 2010a or later. See Appendix C for specific information on using the  demonstration software.  Overheads As an aid to instructors who are using this text, we have prepared a  companion set of overheads. Transparency masters  in Microsoft  Powerpoint format or PDF  for each chapter are available on the web at  hagan.okstate.edu nnd.html.

P-5   Objectives  1 Introduction  1  Objectives History Applications Biological Inspiration Further Reading  1-1 1-2 1-5 1-8 1-10  Objectives  As you read these words you are using a complex biological neural network.  You have a highly interconnected set of some 1011 neurons to facilitate your  reading, breathing, motion and thinking. Each of your biological neurons,  a rich assembly of tissue and chemistry, has the complexity, if not the  speed, of a microprocessor. Some of your neural structure was with you at  birth. Other parts have been established by experience.   Scientists have only just begun to understand how biological neural net- works operate. It is generally understood that all biological neural func- tions, including memory, are stored in the neurons and in the connections  between them. Learning is viewed as the establishment of new connections  between neurons or the modification of existing connections. This leads to  the following question: Although we have only a rudimentary understand- ing of biological neural networks, is it possible to construct a small set of  simple artificial “neurons” and perhaps train them to serve a useful func- tion? The answer is “yes.” This book, then, is about artificial neural net- works.   The neurons that we consider here are not biological. They are extremely  simple abstractions of biological neurons, realized as elements in a pro- gram or perhaps as circuits made of silicon. Networks of these artificial  neurons do not have a fraction of the power of the human brain, but they  can be trained to perform useful functions. This book is about such neu- rons, the networks that contain them and their training.  1-1   1 Introduction  History  The history of artificial neural networks is filled with colorful, creative in- dividuals from a variety of fields, many of whom struggled for decades to  develop concepts that we now take for granted. This history has been doc- umented by various authors. One particularly interesting book is Neuro- computing: Foundations of Research by John Anderson and Edward  Rosenfeld. They have collected and edited a set of some 43 papers of special  historical interest. Each paper is preceded by an introduction that puts the  paper in historical perspective.  Histories of some of the main neural network contributors are included at  the beginning of various chapters throughout this text and will not be re- peated here. However, it seems appropriate to give a brief overview, a sam- ple of the major developments.  At least two ingredients are necessary for the advancement of a technology:  concept and implementation. First, one must have a concept, a way of  thinking about a topic, some view of it that gives a clarity not there before.  This may involve a simple idea, or it may be more specific and include a  mathematical description. To illustrate this point, consider the history of  the heart. It was thought to be, at various times, the center of the soul or a  source of heat. In the 17th century medical practitioners finally began to  view the heart as a pump, and they designed experiments to study its  pumping action. These experiments revolutionized our view of the circula- tory system. Without the pump concept, an understanding of the heart was  out of grasp.  Concepts and their accompanying mathematics are not sufficient for a  technology to mature unless there is some way to implement the system.  For instance, the mathematics necessary for the reconstruction of images  from computer-aided tomography  CAT  scans was known many years be- fore the availability of high-speed computers and efficient algorithms final- ly made it practical to implement a useful CAT system.  The history of neural networks has progressed through both conceptual in- novations and implementation developments. These advancements, how- ever, seem to have occurred in fits and starts rather than by steady  evolution.  Some of the background work for the field of neural networks occurred in  the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This consisted primarily of interdis- ciplinary work in physics, psychology and neurophysiology by such scien- tists as Hermann von Helmholtz, Ernst Mach and Ivan Pavlov. This early  work emphasized general theories of learning, vision, conditioning, etc.,  and did not include specific mathematical models of neuron operation.  1-2   History  1  The modern view of neural networks began in the 1940s with the work of  Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts [McPi43], who showed that networks  of artificial neurons could, in principle, compute any arithmetic or logical  function. Their work is often acknowledged as the origin of the neural net- work field.   McCulloch and Pitts were followed by Donald Hebb [Hebb49], who pro- posed that classical conditioning  as discovered by Pavlov  is present be- cause of the properties of individual neurons. He proposed a mechanism for  learning in biological neurons  see Chapter 7 .  The first practical application of artificial neural networks came in the late  1950s, with the invention of the perceptron network and associated learn- ing rule by Frank Rosenblatt [Rose58]. Rosenblatt and his colleagues built  a perceptron network and demonstrated its ability to perform pattern rec- ognition. This early success generated a great deal of interest in neural net- work research. Unfortunately, it was later shown that the basic perceptron  network could solve only a limited class of problems.  See Chapter 4 for  more on Rosenblatt and the perceptron learning rule.   At about the same time, Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff [WiHo60] intro- duced a new learning algorithm and used it to train adaptive linear neural  networks, which were similar in structure and capability to Rosenblatt’s  perceptron. The Widrow-Hoff learning rule is still in use today.  See Chap- ter 10 for more on Widrow-Hoff learning.   Unfortunately, both Rosenblatt’s and Widrow’s networks suffered from the  same inherent limitations, which were widely publicized in a book by Mar- vin Minsky and Seymour Papert [MiPa69]. Rosenblatt and Widrow were  aware of these limitations and proposed new networks that would over- come them. However, they were not able to successfully modify their learn- ing algorithms to train the more complex networks.   Many people, influenced by Minsky and Papert, believed that further re- search on neural networks was a dead end. This, combined with the fact  that there were no powerful digital computers on which to experiment,  caused many researchers to leave the field. For a decade neural network re- search was largely suspended.  Some important work, however, did continue during the 1970s. In 1972  Teuvo Kohonen [Koho72] and James Anderson [Ande72] independently  and separately developed new neural networks that could act as memories.   See Chapter 15 and Chapter 16 for more on Kohonen networks.  Stephen  Grossberg [Gros76] was also very active during this period in the investi- gation of self-organizing networks.  See Chapter 18 and Chapter 19.   Interest in neural networks had faltered during the late 1960s because of  the lack of new ideas and powerful computers with which to experiment.  During the 1980s both of these impediments were overcome, and research  in neural networks increased dramatically. New personal computers and   1-3   1 Introduction  workstations, which rapidly grew in capability, became widely available. In  addition, important new concepts were introduced.   Two new concepts were most responsible for the rebirth of neural networks.  The first was the use of statistical mechanics to explain the operation of a  certain class of recurrent network, which could be used as an associative  memory. This was described in a seminal paper by physicist John Hopfield  [Hopf82].  Chapter 20 and Chapter 21 discuss these Hopfield networks.   The second key development of the 1980s was the backpropagation algo- rithm for training multilayer perceptron networks, which was discovered  independently by several different researchers. The most influential publi- cation of the backpropagation algorithm was by David Rumelhart and  James McClelland [RuMc86]. This algorithm was the answer to the criti- cisms Minsky and Papert had made in the 1960s.  See Chapter 11 for a de- velopment of the backpropagation algorithm.   These new developments reinvigorated the field of neural networks. Since  the 1980s, thousands of papers have been written, neural networks have  found countless applications, and the field has been buzzing with new the- oretical and practical work.  The brief historical account given above is not intended to identify all of the  major contributors, but is simply to give the reader some feel for how  knowledge in the neural network field has progressed. As one might note,  the progress has not always been “slow but sure.” There have been periods  of dramatic progress and periods when relatively little has been accom- plished.   Many of the advances in neural networks have had to do with new con- cepts, such as innovative architectures and training rules. Just as impor- tant has been the availability of powerful new computers on which to test  these new concepts.  Well, so much for the history of neural networks to this date. The real ques- tion is, “What will happen in the future?” Neural networks have clearly  taken a permanent place as important mathematical engineering tools.  They don’t provide solutions to every problem, but they are essential tools  to be used in appropriate situations. In addition, remember that we still  know very little about how the brain works. The most important advances  in neural networks almost certainly lie in the future.  The large number and wide variety of applications of this technology are  very encouraging. The next section describes some of these applications.  1-4   Applications  Applications  1  A newspaper article described the use of neural networks in literature re- search by Aston University. It stated that “the network can be taught to  recognize individual writing styles, and the researchers used it to compare  works attributed to Shakespeare and his contemporaries.” A popular sci- ence television program documented the use of neural networks by an Ital- ian research institute to test the purity of olive oil. Google uses neural  networks for image tagging  automatically identifying an image and as- signing keywords , and Microsoft has developed neural networks that can  help convert spoken English speech into spoken Chinese speech. Research- ers at Lund University and Skåne University Hospital in Sweden have  used neural networks to improve long-term survival rates for heart trans- plant recipients by identifying optimal recipient and donor matches. These  examples are indicative of the broad range of applications that can be found  for neural networks. The applications are expanding because neural net- works are good at solving problems, not just in engineering, science and  mathematics, but in medicine, business, finance and literature as well.  Their application to a wide variety of problems in many fields makes them  very attractive. Also, faster computers and faster algorithms have made it  possible to use neural networks to solve complex industrial problems that  formerly required too much computation.  The following note and Table of Neural Network Applications are repro- duced here from the Neural Network Toolbox for MATLAB with the per- mission of the MathWorks, Inc.  A 1988 DARPA Neural Network Study [DARP88] lists various neural net- work applications, beginning with the adaptive channel equalizer in about  1984. This device, which is an outstanding commercial success, is a single- neuron network used in long distance telephone systems to stabilize voice  signals. The DARPA report goes on to list other commercial applications,  including a small word recognizer, a process monitor, a sonar classifier and  a risk analysis system. Thousands of neural networks have been applied in hundreds of fields in  the many years since the DARPA report was written. A list of some of those  applications follows.

In this section we will briefly describe  those characteristics of brain function that have inspired the development  of artificial neural networks.  The brain consists of a large number  approximately 1011  of highly con- nected elements  approximately 104 connections per element  called neu- rons. For our purposes these neurons have three principal components: the  dendrites, the cell body and the axon. The dendrites are tree-like receptive  networks of nerve fibers that carry electrical signals into the cell body. The  cell body effectively sums and thresholds these incoming signals. The axon  is a single long fiber that carries the signal from the cell body out to other  neurons. The point of contact between an axon of one cell and a dendrite of  another cell is called a synapse. It is the arrangement of neurons and the  strengths of the individual synapses, determined by a complex chemical  process, that establishes the function of the neural network. Figure 1.1 is  a simplified schematic diagram of two biological neurons.  Dendrites  Synapse  Axon  Cell Body  Figure 1.1  Schematic Drawing of Biological Neurons  Some of the neural structure is defined at birth. Other parts are developed  through learning, as new connections are made and others waste away.  This development is most noticeable in the early stages of life. For example,   1-8   1  Biological Inspiration  it has been shown that if a young cat is denied use of one eye during a crit- ical window of time, it will never develop normal vision in that eye. Lin- guists have discovered that infants over six months of age can no longer  discriminate certain speech sounds, unless they were exposed to them ear- lier in life [WeTe84].  Neural structures continue to change throughout life. These later changes  tend to consist mainly of strengthening or weakening of synaptic junctions.  For instance, it is believed that new memories are formed by modification  of these synaptic strengths. Thus, the process of learning a new friend’s  face consists of altering various synapses. Neuroscientists have discovered  [MaGa2000], for example, that the hippocampi of London taxi drivers are  significantly larger than average. This is because they must memorize a  large amount of navigational information—a process that takes more than  two years.  Artificial neural networks do not approach the complexity of the brain.  There are, however, two key similarities between biological and artificial  neural networks. First, the building blocks of both networks are simple  computational devices  although artificial neurons are much simpler than  biological neurons  that are highly interconnected. Second, the connections  between neurons determine the function of the network. The primary ob- jective of this book will be to determine the appropriate connections to solve  particular problems.  It is worth noting that even though biological neurons are very slow when  compared to electrical circuits  10-3 s compared to 10-10 s , the brain is  able to perform many tasks much faster than any conventional computer.  This is in part because of the massively parallel structure of biological neu- ral networks; all of the neurons are operating at the same time. Artificial  neural networks share this parallel structure. Even though most artificial  neural networks are currently implemented on conventional digital com- puters, their parallel structure makes them ideally suited to implementa- tion using VLSI, optical devices and parallel processors.  In the following chapter we will introduce our basic artificial neuron and  will explain how we can combine such neurons to form networks. This will  provide a background for Chapter 3, where we take our first look at neural  networks in action.  1-9   1 Introduction  Further Reading  [Ande72]   J. A.

The model was trained, using a generaliza- tion of the Hebb postulate, to learn an association between  input and output vectors. The physiological plausibility of  the network was emphasized. Kohonen published a closely  related paper at the same time [Koho72], although the two  researchers were working independently.  [AnRo88]  J. A. Anderson and E.

The network, which consists of  short-term and long-term memory mechanisms, is a contin- uous-time competitive network. It forms a basis for the  adaptive resonance theory  ART  networks.  1-10   Further Reading  [Gros80]  S.

[Hopf82]  [MaGa00]  The main premise of this seminal book is that behavior can  be explained by the action of neurons. In it, Hebb proposed  one of the first learning laws, which postulated a mecha- nism for learning at the cellular level.  Hebb proposes that classical conditioning in biology is  present because of the properties of individual neurons.  J. J.

Kohonen proposed a correlation matrix model for associa- tive memory. The model was trained, using the outer prod- uct rule  also known as the Hebb rule , to learn an  association between input and output vectors. The mathe- matical structure of the network was emphasized. Ander- son published a closely related paper at the same time  [Ande72], although the two researchers were working inde- pendently.  E. A.

Now we will introduce our simplified mathematical  model of the neuron and will explain how these artificial neurons can be in- terconnected to form a variety of network architectures. We will also illus- trate the basic operation of these networks through some simple examples.  The concepts and notation introduced in this chapter will be used through- out this book.  This chapter does not cover all of the architectures that will be used in this  book, but it does present the basic building blocks. More complex architec- tures will be introduced and discussed as they are needed in later chapters.  Even so, a lot of detail is presented here.

Instead, treat it as a sample to get you started and a resource to which  you can return.  2-1   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  Theory and Examples  Notation  Unfortunately, there is no single neural network notation that is universal- ly accepted. Papers and books on neural networks have come from many di- verse fields, including engineering, physics, psychology and mathematics,  and many authors tend to use vocabulary peculiar to their specialty. As a  result, many books and papers in this field are difficult to read, and con- cepts are made to seem more complex than they actually are. This is a  shame, as it has prevented the spread of important new ideas. It has also  led to more than one “reinvention of the wheel.”  In this book we have tried to use standard notation where possible, to be  clear and to keep matters simple without sacrificing rigor. In particular, we  have tried to define practical conventions and use them consistently.   Figures, mathematical equations and text discussing both figures and  mathematical equations will use the following notation:  Scalars — small italic letters: a,b,c  Vectors — small bold nonitalic letters: a,b,c  Matrices — capital BOLD nonitalic letters: A,B,C   Additional notation concerning the network architectures will be intro- duced as you read this chapter. A complete list of the notation that we use  throughout the book is given in Appendix B, so you can look there if you  have a question.   Neuron Model  Weight Bias Net Input Transfer Function  Single-Input Neuron A single-input neuron is shown in Figure 2.1. The scalar input  plied by the scalar weight   to form  w summer. The other input,  , is multiplied by a bias  1 the summer. The summer output  into a transfer function   Some authors use the term “activation function” rather than transfer func- tion and “offset” rather than bias.     is multi- , one of the terms that is sent to the   and then passed to  , often referred to as the net input, goes   , which produces the scalar neuron output   wp  .   n  b  p  a  f  If we relate this simple model back to the biological neuron that we dis- cussed in Chapter 1, the weight   corresponds to the strength of a synapse,  the cell body is represented by the summation and the transfer function,  and the neuron output    represents the signal on the axon.  w  a  2-2   Neuron Model  Inputs  General Neuron  p   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w n  cid:0  cid:0   b  f   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   1 a = f  wp + b   Figure 2.1  Single-Input Neuron  2  The neuron output is calculated as  a  =   f wp  b+    .

We will discuss transfer functions in the next section.  The bias is much like a weight, except that it has a constant input of 1.  However, if you do not want to have a bias in a particular neuron, it can be  omitted. We will see examples of this in Chapters 3, 7 and 16.  b  w  Note that   and  are both adjustable scalar parameters of the neuron.  Typically the transfer function is chosen by the designer and then the pa- rameters   will be adjusted by some learning rule so that the neu- ron input output relationship meets some specific goal  see Chapter 4 for  an introduction to learning rules . As described in the following section, we  have different transfer functions for different purposes.   and   w  b  Transfer Functions  The transfer function in Figure 2.1 may be a linear or a nonlinear function  of  . A particular transfer function is chosen to satisfy some specification  of the problem that the neuron is attempting to solve.  n  A variety of transfer functions have been included in this book. Three of the  most commonly used functions are discussed below.  The hard limit transfer function, shown on the left side of Figure 2.2, sets  the output of the neuron to 0 if the function argument is less than 0, or 1 if  its argument is greater than or equal to 0. We will use this function to cre- ate neurons that classify inputs into two distinct categories. It will be used  extensively in Chapter 4.  2-3  Hard Limit  Transfer Function   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  a  +1  0 -1 a = hardlim  n   n   cid:0  cid:0   -b w  p  a  +1  0 -1  Hard Limit Transfer Function  a = hardlim  wp + b   Single-Input hardlim Neuron  Figure 2.2  Hard Limit Transfer Function  The graph on the right side of Figure 2.2 illustrates the input output char- acteristic of a single-input neuron that uses a hard limit transfer function.  Here we can see the effect of the weight and the bias. Note that an icon for  the hard limit transfer function is shown between the two figures. Such  icons will replace the general   in network diagrams to show the particular  transfer function that is being used.  f  The output of a linear transfer function is equal to its input:  a  n=  ,   2.1   as illustrated in Figure 2.3.  Neurons with this transfer function are used in the ADALINE networks,  which are discussed in Chapter 10.  a  +b  0  n   cid:0   -b w  p  Linear  Transfer Function  a = purelin  n   Linear Transfer Function  a = purelin  wp + b   Single-Input purelin Neuron  Figure 2.3  Linear Transfer Function  The output   ron with a bias is shown on the right of Figure 2.3.    versus input    p  a    characteristic of a single-input linear neu-  Log-Sigmoid  Transfer Function  The log-sigmoid transfer function is shown in Figure 2.4.  a  +1  0 -1  2-4   Neuron Model  a   +1  0  -1 a = logsig  n   a   +1  p  2  n   cid:0  cid:0   -b w  0 -1 a = logsig  wp + b   Log-Sigmoid Transfer Function  Single-Input logsig Neuron  Figure 2.4  Log-Sigmoid Transfer Function  This transfer function takes the input  which may have any value between  plus and minus infinity  and squashes the output into the range 0 to 1, ac- cording to the expression:  a  =  1 ---------------- e n–+ 1  .   2.2   The log-sigmoid transfer function is commonly used in multilayer networks  that are trained using the backpropagation algorithm, in part because this  function is differentiable  see Chapter 11 .  Most of the transfer functions used in this book are summarized in Table  2.1. Of course, you can define other transfer functions in addition to those  shown in Table 2.1 if you wish.

This expression can be written in matrix form:  where the matrix   W   for the single neuron case has only one row.  Now the neuron output can be written as  n Wp b+  =  ,  a  =   f Wp b+    .   2.3    2.4    2.5   Fortunately, neural networks can often be described with matrices. This  kind of matrix expression will be used throughout the book. Don’t be con- cerned if you are rusty with matrix and vector operations. We will review  these topics in Chapters 5 and 6, and we will provide many examples and  solved problems that will spell out the procedures.  We have adopted a particular convention in assigning the indices of the el- ements of the weight matrix. The first index indicates the particular neu- ron destination for that weight. The second index indicates the source of  the signal fed to the neuron. Thus, the indices in  represents the connection to the first  and only  neuron from the second  source. Of course, this convention is more useful if there is more than one  neuron, as will be the case later in this chapter.   say that this weight   w1 2  2-7  Weight Indices   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  We would like to draw networks with several neurons, each having several  inputs. Further, we would like to have more than one layer of neurons. You  can imagine how complex such a network might appear if all the lines were  drawn. It would take a lot of ink, could hardly be read, and the mass of de- tail might obscure the main features. Thus, we will use an abbreviated no- tation. A multiple-input neuron using this notation is shown in Figure 2.6.

You will not have to guess the kind of variable  or its dimensions.  Note that the number of inputs to a network is set by the external specifi- cations of the problem. If, for instance, you want to design a neural network  that is to predict kite-flying conditions and the inputs are air temperature,  wind velocity and humidity, then there would be three inputs to the net- work.

We  might need five or ten, operating in parallel, in what we will call a “layer.”  This concept of a layer is discussed below.  2  Layer   neurons is shown in Figure 2.7.

You might ask if all the neurons in a layer must have the same transfer  function. The answer is no; you can define a single  composite  layer of neu- rons having different transfer functions by combining two of the networks   2-9   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  shown above in parallel. Both networks would have the same inputs, and  each network would create some of the outputs.  The input vector elements enter the network through the weight matrix  W  :  W  =  w1 1 w1 2  w1 R w2 1 w2 2  w2 R    wS 1 wS 2  wS R  .   2.6   As noted previously, the row indices of the elements of matrix   indicate  the destination neuron associated with that weight, while the column indi- ces indicate the source of the input for that weight. Thus, the indices in   say that this weight represents the connection to the third neuron  w3 2 from the second source.

For in- stance, a two-layer network having a sigmoid first layer and a linear second  layer can be trained to approximate most functions arbitrarily well. Single- layer networks cannot do this.  At this point the number of choices to be made in specifying a network may  look overwhelming, so let us consider this topic. The problem is not as bad  as it looks. First, recall that the number of inputs to the network and the  number of outputs from the network are defined by external problem spec- ifications. So if there are four external variables to be used as inputs, there  are four inputs to the network. Similarly, if there are to be seven outputs  from the network, there must be seven neurons in the output layer. Finally,  the desired characteristics of the output signal also help to select the trans- fer function for the output layer. If an output is to be either  , then  a symmetrical hard limit transfer function should be used. Thus, the archi- tecture of a single-layer network is almost completely determined by prob- lem specifications, including the specific number of inputs and outputs and  the particular output signal characteristic.   or   1–  1  Now, what if we have more than two layers? Here the external problem  does not tell you directly the number of neurons required in the hidden lay- ers. In fact, there are few problems for which one can predict the optimal  number of neurons needed in a hidden layer. This problem is an active area  of research. We will develop some feeling on this matter as we proceed to  Chapter 11, Backpropagation.  As for the number of layers, most practical neural networks have just two  or three layers. Four or more layers are used rarely.  We should say something about the use of biases. One can choose neurons  with or without biases. The bias gives the network an extra variable, and  so you might expect that networks with biases would be more powerful   2-12   Network Architectures  than those without, and that is true. Note, for instance, that a neuron with- out a bias will always have a net input   of zero when the network inputs   are zero. This may not be desirable and can be avoided by the use of a  p bias. The effect of the bias is discussed more fully in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.   n  In later chapters we will omit a bias in some examples or demonstrations.  In some cases this is done simply to reduce the number of network param- eters. With just two variables, we can plot system convergence in a two-di- mensional plane. Three or more variables are difficult to display.  2  Recurrent Networks Before we discuss recurrent networks, we need to introduce some simple  building blocks. The first is the delay block, which is illustrated in Figure  2.11.  Delay  Figure 2.11  Delay Block  The delay output   a t    is computed from its input   u t    according to  a t   =  u t  1–    .   2.7   Thus the output is the input delayed by one time step.  This assumes that  time is updated in discrete steps and takes on only integer values.  Eq.  2.7   requires that the output be initialized at time  . This initial condition  is indicated in Figure 2.11 by the arrow coming into the bottom of the delay  block.  0=  t  Integrator  Another related building block, which we will use for the continuous-time  recurrent networks in Chapters 18–21, is the integrator, which is shown in  Figure 2.12.

A recurrent network is  a network with feedback; some of its outputs are connected to its inputs.  This is quite different from the networks that we have studied thus far,  which were strictly feedforward with no backward connections. One type of  discrete-time recurrent network is shown in Figure 2.13.   Initial  Condition  Recurrent Layer  p S x 1  1  S   cid:0  W S x S  cid:0  b  cid:0  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   D  a t  S x 1  n t + 1  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a t + 1   cid:0  cid:0  S x 1  cid:0  cid:0   S  a 0  = p      a t + 1  = satlins  Wa t  + b   Figure 2.13  Recurrent Network  2-14   Network Architectures  In this particular network the vector  a 0  p= outputs:   supplies the initial conditions  i.e.,   .

Recurrent networks are potentially more powerful than feedforward net- works and can exhibit temporal behavior. These types of networks are dis- cussed in Chapters 3, 14 and 18–21.  2  2-15   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  Summary of Results  Single-Input Neuron  Multiple-Input Neuron  Inputs  General Neuron  p   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w n  cid:0  cid:0   b  f   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   1 a = f  wp + b   Inputs  Multiple-Input Neuron  p1 p2p3  pR  w1, 1  cid:0  cid:0 Σ n  cid:0  cid:0  w1, R  b   cid:0  cid:0 f a  cid:0  cid:0   1 a = f  Wp + b   Input  Multiple-Input Neuron   cid:0  cid:0  p  cid:0  cid:0  W R x 1 1 x R  cid:0  cid:0 b 1  cid:0  cid:0   1 x 1  R  n 1 x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0  1 x 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   f  1  a = f  Wp + b   2-16   Summary of Results  Transfer Functions  Name  Input Output Relation  Icon  MATLAB Function  2  Hard Limit  Symmetrical Hard Limit  a a  = =  0 1  n n  0 0  a a  –= 1 = +1  n n  0 0  Linear  a  n=  Saturating Linear  Symmetric Saturating   Linear  Log-Sigmoid  Hyperbolic Tangent   Sigmoid  a a a  a a a  = = =  0 n 1  n 0 n  0   n 1  1  1  –= = n = 1  n 1– n  1–   n 1  1  a  =  1 ---------------- e n–+ 1  a  =  e n–– en ------------------ e n–+ en  Positive Linear  a  = a  0 =  n  n  0 0  n  Competitive  a a  = =  1    neuron with max n 0    all other neurons   cid:0  cid:0   hardlim   cid:0  cid:0   hardlims   cid:0  cid:0   purelin   cid:0  cid:0   satlin   cid:0  cid:0   satlins   cid:0  cid:0   logsig   cid:0  cid:0   tansig   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  C  cid:0   poslin  compet  2-17   2 Neuron Model and Network Architectures  Layer of Neurons  Input  Layer of S Neurons  p R x 1  1  S x R  n cid:0 W  cid:0 b  cid:0   S x 1  S x 1  f  a  cid:0  cid:0  S x 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   S  R  a = f Wp + b   Three Layers of Neurons  Input  First Layer  Second Layer  Third Layer  p R x 1  1  R   cid:0  W1  cid:0  S1 x R  cid:0 b1  cid:0   S1 x 1  n1 S1 x 1  f 1   cid:0  cid:0  a1  cid:0  cid:0  S1 x 1  cid:0  cid:0  1  cid:0  cid:0   S1   cid:0  W2  cid:0  S2 x S1  cid:0 b2  cid:0   S2 x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a2  cid:0  cid:0  S2 x 1 n2 S2 x 1  cid:0  cid:0  1  cid:0  cid:0   f 2  W3 S3 x S2   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 b3  cid:0  cid:0   S3 x 1  S2   cid:0  cid:0  a3  cid:0  cid:0  S3 x 1 n3 S3 x 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   f 3  S3  a1 = f 1  W1p + b1   a2 = f 2  W2a1 + b2   a3 = f 3  W3a2 + b3   a3 = f 3  W3 f 2  W2f 1  W1p + b1  + b2   + b3   Delay  Delay  D   cid:0  cid:0  u t  a t   cid:0  cid:0  a 0   a t  = u t - 1   2-18   Summary of Results  Integrator  Integrator  u t   a t   a 0   a t  =   u τ  dτ + a 0   t  0  2  Recurrent Network  Initial  Condition  Recurrent Layer  p S x 1  1  S   cid:0  W S x S  cid:0  b  cid:0  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   D  a t  S x 1  n t + 1  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a t + 1   cid:0  cid:0  S x 1  cid:0  cid:0   S  a 0  = p      a t + 1  = satlins  Wa t  + b   How to Pick an Architecture  Problem specifications help define the network in the following ways:  1.

One of the main objectives of this chapter has been to  introduce our basic notation. As the networks are discussed in more detail  in later chapters, you may wish to return to Chapter 2 to refresh your mem- ory of the appropriate notation.  This chapter was not meant to be a complete presentation of the networks  we have discussed here. That will be done in the chapters that follow. We  will begin in Chapter 3, which will present a simple example that uses  some of the networks described in this chapter, and will give you an oppor- tunity to see these networks in action. The networks demonstrated in  Chapter 3 are representative of the types of networks that are covered in  the remainder of this text.  2-22   Exercises  Exercises  E2.1 A single input neuron has a weight of 1.3 and a bias of 3.0.

We will take a  simple pattern recognition problem and show how it can be solved using  three different neural network architectures. It will be an opportunity to  see how the architectures described in the previous chapter can be used to  solve a practical  although extremely oversimplified  problem. Do not ex- pect to completely understand these three networks after reading this  chapter. We present them simply to give you a taste of what can be done  with neural networks, and to demonstrate that there are many different  types of networks that can be used to solve a given problem.  The three networks presented in this chapter are representative of the  types of networks discussed in the remaining chapters: feedforward net- works  represented here by the perceptron , competitive networks  repre- sented here by the Hamming network  and recurrent associative memory  networks  represented here by the Hopfield network .  3-1   3 An Illustrative Example  Theory and Examples  Problem Statement  A produce dealer has a warehouse that stores a variety of fruits and vege- tables. When fruit is brought to the warehouse, various types of fruit may  be mixed together. The dealer wants a machine that will sort the fruit ac- cording to type. There is a conveyer belt on which the fruit is loaded. This  conveyer passes through a set of sensors, which measure three properties  of the fruit: shape, texture and weight. These sensors are somewhat primi- tive. The shape sensor will output a 1 if the fruit is approximately round  and a   if it is more elliptical. The texture sensor will output a 1 if the sur- face of the fruit is smooth and a  output a 1 if the fruit is more than one pound and a  pound.   if it is rough. The weight sensor will    if it is less than one   1–  1–  1–  The three sensor outputs will then be input to a neural network. The pur- pose of the network is to decide which kind of fruit is on the conveyor, so  that the fruit can be directed to the correct storage bin. To make the prob- lem even simpler, let’s assume that there are only two kinds of fruit on the  conveyor: apples and oranges.   Neural Network  Sensors  Sorter  Apples Oranges  As each fruit passes through the sensors it can be represented by a three- dimensional vector. The first element of the vector will represent shape,  the second element will represent texture and the third element will repre- sent weight:  3-2   Perceptron  p  =  shape texture weight  .  p1  =  p2  =  ,  .  1 1– 1–  1 1 1–  Therefore, a prototype orange would be represented by  and a prototype apple would be represented by   3.2   3   3.1    3.3   The neural network will receive one three-dimensional input vector for  each fruit on the conveyer and must make a decision as to whether the fruit  is an orange    or an apple   .       p1  p2  Now that we have defined this simple  trivial?  pattern recognition prob- lem, let’s look briefly at three different neural networks that could be used  to solve it. The simplicity of our problem will facilitate our understanding  of the operation of the networks.  Perceptron  The first network we will discuss is the perceptron.

The two-input percep- R tron is shown in Figure 3.2.  2=  3=  R  Inputs  Two-Input Neuron  p1  p2   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w1,1 n  cid:0  cid:0  w1,2  b   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   1  a = hardlims  Wp + b   Figure 3.2  Two-Input Single-Neuron Perceptron  Single-neuron perceptrons can classify input vectors into two categories.  For example, for a two-input perceptron, if   then   and   1–=  1=  w1 1  w1 2  a  =  hardlims n   =  hardlims    1– 1 p b+    .   3.4   Therefore, if the inner product of the weight matrix  a single row vector in  this case  with the input vector is greater than or equal to  , the output  will be 1. If the inner product of the weight vector and the input is less than  . This divides the input space into two parts. Fig- b– . The blue line in the fig- ure 3.3 illustrates this for the case where  1–= ure represents all points for which the net input  n  , the output will be    is equal to 0:  1–  b–  b     n  =  1– 1 p 1–  =  0  .   3.5   Notice that this decision boundary will always be orthogonal to the weight  matrix, and the position of the boundary can be shifted by changing  .  In  the general case,   is a matrix consisting of a number of row vectors, each  of which will be used in an equation like Eq.  3.5 . There will be one bound- ary for each row of  . See Chapter 4 for more on this topic.  The shaded  region contains all input vectors for which the output of the network will  be 1. The output will be    for all other input vectors.

The decision boundary between  the categories is determined by the equation  Wp b+  0=  .   3.6   Because the boundary must be linear, the single-layer perceptron can only  be used to recognize patterns that are linearly separable  can be separated  by a linear boundary . These concepts will be discussed in more detail in  Chapter 4.  Pattern Recognition Example Now consider the apple and orange pattern recognition problem. Because  there are only two categories, we can use a single-neuron perceptron. The  vector inputs are three-dimensional   equation will be   , therefore the perceptron   3=  R  a  =  hardlims w1 1 w1 2 w1 3   3.7         p1 p2 p3     b+    .  b   and the elements of the weight matrix so that  We want to choose the bias  the perceptron will be able to distinguish between apples and oranges. For  example, we may want the output of the perceptron to be 1 when an apple  is input and   when an orange is input. Using the concept illustrated in  Figure 3.3, let’s find a linear boundary that can separate oranges and ap-  1–  3-5   3 An Illustrative Example  ples. The two prototype vectors  recall Eq.  3.2  and Eq.  3.3   are shown in  Figure 3.4. From this figure we can see that the linear boundary that di- vides these two vectors symmetrically is the    plane.    p1 p3  p3  p2    p1 p3  The  the equation  or  p1  p1   orange   p2  apple   Figure 3.4   Prototype Vectors   plane, which will be our decision boundary, can be described by   p2  0=  ,  0 1 0  0+  0=  .  p1 p2 p3   3.8    3.9   Therefore the weight matrix and bias will be  W  =  0 1 0  ,   b  0=  .   3.10   The weight matrix is orthogonal to the decision boundary and points to- ward the region that contains the prototype pattern  want the perceptron to produce an output of 1. The bias is 0 because the  decision boundary passes through the origin.    apple  for which we   p2  Now let’s test the operation of our perceptron pattern classifier. It classifies  perfect apples and oranges correctly since  3-6   Perceptron  Orange:  Apple:  a  =  hardlims 0 1 0  =  –   1 orange    ,   3.11   a  =  hardlims 0 1 0  =   1 apple    .   3.12   But what happens if we put a not-so-perfect orange into the classifier? Let’s  say that an orange with an elliptical shape is passed through the sensors.  The input vector would then be  3   3.13                     1 1– 1–     0+    1 1 1–     0+    p  =  .  1– 1– 1–  1– 1– 1–     0+    The response of the network would be  a  =  hardlims 0 1 0  =  –   1 orange    .   3.14   In fact, any input vector that is closer to the orange prototype vector than  to the apple prototype vector  in Euclidean distance  will be classified as an  orange  and vice versa .  To experiment with the perceptron network and the apple orange classifica- tion problem, use the Neural Network Design Demonstration Perceptron  Classification  nnd3pc .  This example has demonstrated some of the features of the perceptron net- work, but by no means have we exhausted our investigation of perceptrons.  This network, and variations on it, will be examined in Chapters 4 through  13. Let’s consider some of these future topics.  In the apple orange example we were able to design a network graphically,  by choosing a decision boundary that clearly separated the patterns. What  about practical problems, with high dimensional input spaces? In Chapters  4, 7, 10 and 11 we will introduce learning algorithms that can be used to   3-7   3 An Illustrative Example  train networks to solve complex problems by using a set of examples of  proper network behavior.  The key characteristic of the single-layer perceptron is that it creates linear  decision boundaries to separate categories of input vector. What if we have  categories that cannot be separated by linear boundaries? This question  will be addressed in Chapter 11, where we will introduce the multilayer  perceptron. The multilayer networks are able to solve classification prob- lems of arbitrary complexity.  Hamming Network  The next network we will consider is the Hamming network [Lipp87]. It  was designed explicitly to solve binary pattern recognition problems   where each element of the input vector has only two possible values — in  our example 1 or   . This is an interesting network, because it uses both  feedforward and recurrent  feedback  layers, which were both described in  Chapter 2. Figure 3.5 shows the standard Hamming network. Note that  the number of neurons in the first layer is the same as the number of neu- rons in the second layer.  1–  The objective of the Hamming network is to decide which prototype vector  is closest to the input vector. This decision is indicated by the output of the  recurrent layer. There is one neuron in the recurrent layer for each proto- type pattern. When the recurrent layer converges, there will be only one  neuron with nonzero output. This neuron indicates the prototype pattern  that is closest to the input vector. Now let’s investigate the two layers of the  Hamming network in detail.

In order for the feedforward layer to perform this correlation, the  rows of the weight matrix in the feedforward layer, represented by the con- nection matrix  , are set to the prototype patterns. For our apple and or- ange example this would mean  W1  W1  =  p1 T p2 T  =  1 1– 1 1  1– 1–  .  3   3.15   The feedforward layer uses a linear transfer function, and each element of  the bias vector is equal to   is the number of elements in the in- put vector. For our example the bias vector would be  , where   R  R  b1  =  .  3 3   3.16    3.17   With these choices for the weight matrix and bias vector, the output of the  feedforward layer is  a1 W1p b1+  =  =  T p1 T p2  p  +  =  3 3  Tp 3+ p1 Tp 3+ p2  .  Note that the outputs of the feedforward layer are equal to the inner prod- ucts of each prototype pattern with the input, plus  . For two vectors of  equal length  norm , their inner product will be largest when the vectors  point in the same direction, and will be smallest when they point in oppo- site directions.  We will discuss this concept in more depth in Chapters 5,  8 and 9.  By adding   to the inner product we guarantee that the outputs  of the feedforward layer can never be negative. This is required for proper  operation of the recurrent layer.  R  R  This network is called the Hamming network because the neuron in the  feedforward layer with the largest output will correspond to the prototype  pattern that is closest in Hamming distance to the input pattern.  The  Hamming distance between two vectors is equal to the number of elements  that are different. It is defined only for binary vectors.  We leave it to the  reader to show that the outputs of the feedforward layer are equal to    minus twice the Hamming distances from the prototype patterns to the in- put pattern.  2R  3-9   3 An Illustrative Example  Recurrent Layer The recurrent layer of the Hamming network is what is known as a “com- petitive” layer. The neurons in this layer are initialized with the outputs of  the feedforward layer, which indicate the correlation between the proto- type patterns and the input vector. Then the neurons compete with each  other to determine a winner. After the competition, only one neuron will  have a nonzero output. The winning neuron indicates which category of in- put was presented to the network  for our example the two categories are  apples and oranges . The equations that describe the competition are:  and  a2 0   a1=        Initial Condition ,  a2 t  1+    =  poslin W2a2 t       .   Don’t forget that the superscripts here indicate the layer number, not a  power of 2.  The   transfer function is linear for positive values and  zero for negative values. The weight matrix W2 has the form  poslin   3.18    3.19    3.20   W2  =  1 –  – 1  ,     is some number less than   where  rons in the recurrent layer.

Each element is reduced by the same fraction of the other. The larger ele- ment will be reduced by less, and the smaller element will be reduced by  more, therefore the difference between large and small will be increased.  The effect of the recurrent layer is to zero out all neuron outputs, except the  one with the largest initial value  which corresponds to the prototype pat- tern that is closest in Hamming distance to the input .  To illustrate the operation of the Hamming network, consider again the ob- long orange that we used to test the perceptron:  3-10   Hamming Network  p  =  .  1– 1– 1–   3.22   The output of the feedforward layer will be  a1  =  1 1– 1 1  1– 1–  +  =  3 3  3+  1 3+ 1–      =  ,  4 2  1– 1– 1–   3.23   3  which will then become the initial condition for the recurrent layer.

Prototype pattern number one, the orange, is chosen  as the correct match, since neuron number one has the only nonzero out- put.  Recall that the first element of  .  This is the correct  choice, since the Hamming distance from the orange prototype to the input  pattern is 1, and the Hamming distance from the apple prototype to the in- put pattern is 2.

These com- petitive networks will be discussed in Chapters 15, 16, 18 and 19. They are  self-organizing networks, which can learn to adjust their prototype vectors  based on the inputs that have been presented.  The final network we will discuss in this brief preview is the Hopfield net- work. This is a recurrent network that is similar in some respects to the re- current layer of the Hamming network, but which can effectively perform  the operations of both layers of the Hamming network. A diagram of the  Hopfield network is shown in Figure 3.6.  This figure is actually a slight  variation of the standard Hopfield network. We use this variation because  it is somewhat simpler to describe and yet demonstrates the basic con- cepts.   The neurons in this network are initialized with the input vector, then the  network iterates until the output converges. When the network is operat- ing correctly, the resulting output should be one of the prototype vectors.  Therefore, whereas in the Hamming network the nonzero neuron indicates  which prototype pattern is chosen, the Hopfield network actually produces  the selected prototype pattern at its output.

Hopfield design procedures will be discussed in detail in Chapter 21.   To illustrate the operation of the network, we have determined a weight  matrix and a bias vector that can solve our orange and apple pattern rec- ognition problem. They are given in Eq.  3.28 .  3  W  =  0.2 0 0 0 1.2 0 0 0.2 0  b  =  0.9 0  0.9–   3.28   Although the procedure for computing the weights and biases for the  Hopfield network is beyond the scope of this chapter, we can say a few  things about why the parameters in Eq.  3.28  work for the apple and or- ange example.  p2  . In both patterns, the first element is   ,  We want the network output to converge to either the orange pattern,  p1 , and the  or the apple pattern,  third element is  . The difference between the patterns occurs in the sec- ond element. Therefore, no matter what pattern is input to the network, we  want the first element of the output pattern to converge to  , the third el- ement to converge to  ,  whichever is closer to the second element of the input vector.  , and the second element to go to either    or   1–  1–  1–  1  1  1  The equations of operation of the Hopfield network, using the parameters  given in Eq.  3.28 , are  a1 t  1+    satlins 0.2a1 t     0.9+    a2 t  1+    satlins 1.2a2 t       a3 t  1+    satlins 0.2a3 t     0.9–    =  =  =  Regardless of the initial values,  until it saturates at  urates at  Therefore, if it is initially negative, it will eventually saturate at  initially positive it will saturate at   , the first element will be increased  , and the third element will be decreased until it sat- .  ; if it is   .

The perceptron had a single output, which could take on values of -1   orange  or 1  apple . In the Hamming network the single nonzero neuron in- dicated which prototype pattern had the closest match. If the first neuron  was nonzero, that indicated orange, and if the second neuron was nonzero,  that indicated apple. In the Hopfield network the prototype pattern itself  appears at the output of the network.  To experiment with the Hopfield network and the apple orange classifica- tion problem, use the Neural Network Design Demonstration Hopfield Clas- sification  nnd3hopc .  As with the other networks demonstrated in this chapter, do not expect to  feel completely comfortable with the Hopfield network at this point. There  are a number of questions that we have not discussed. For example, “How  do we know that the network will eventually converge?” It is possible for  recurrent networks to oscillate or to have chaotic behavior. In addition, we  have not discussed general procedures for designing the weight matrix and  the bias vector. These topics will be discussed in detail in Chapters 20 and  21.  3-14   Epilogue  Epilogue  3  The three networks that we have introduced in this chapter demonstrate  many of the characteristics that are found in the architectures which are  discussed throughout this book.   Feedforward networks, of which the perceptron is one example, are pre- sented in Chapters 4, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 17. In these networks, the output is  computed directly from the input in one pass; no feedback is involved.  Feedforward networks are used for pattern recognition, as in the apple and  orange example, and also for function approximation  see Chapter 11 .  Function approximation applications are found in such areas as adaptive  filtering  see Chapter 10  and automatic control.  Competitive networks, represented here by the Hamming network, are  characterized by two properties. First, they compute some measure of dis- tance between stored prototype patterns and the input pattern. Second,  they perform a competition to determine which neuron represents the pro- totype pattern closest to the input. In the competitive networks that are  discussed in Chapters 16, 18 and 19, the prototype patterns are adjusted  as new inputs are applied to the network. These adaptive networks learn  to cluster the inputs into different categories.  Recurrent networks, like the Hopfield network, were originally inspired by  statistical mechanics. They have been used as associative memories, in  which stored data is recalled by association with input data, rather than by  an address. They have also been used to solve a variety of optimization  problems. We will discuss these recurrent networks in Chapters 20 and 21.  We hope this chapter has piqued your curiosity about the capabilities of  neural networks and has raised some questions. A few of the questions we  will answer in later chapters are:  1. How do we determine the weight matrix and bias for perceptron net-  works with many inputs, where it is impossible to visualize the decision  boundary?  Chapters 4 and 10   2.  If the categories to be recognized are not linearly separable, can we ex- tend the standard perceptron to solve the problem?  Chapters 11, 12  and 13   3.

We will begin by explaining what  a learning rule is and will then develop the perceptron learning rule. We  will conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of the single- layer perceptron network. This discussion will lead us into future chapters.  4-1   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  Theory and Examples  In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced one of the first ar- tificial neurons [McPi43]. The main feature of their neuron model is that a  weighted sum of input signals is compared to a threshold to determine the  neuron output. When the sum is greater than or equal to the threshold, the  output is 1. When the sum is less than the threshold, the output is 0. They  went on to show that networks of these neurons could, in principle, com- pute any arithmetic or logical function. Unlike biological networks, the pa- rameters of their networks had to be designed, as no training method was  available. However, the perceived connection between biology and digital  computers generated a great deal of interest.  In the late 1950s, Frank Rosenblatt and several other researchers devel- oped a class of neural networks called perceptrons. The neurons in these  networks were similar to those of McCulloch and Pitts. Rosenblatt’s key  contribution was the introduction of a learning rule for training perceptron  networks to solve pattern recognition problems [Rose58]. He proved that  his learning rule will always converge to the correct network weights, if  weights exist that solve the problem. Learning was simple and automatic.  Examples of proper behavior were presented to the network, which learned  from its mistakes. The perceptron could even learn when initialized with  random values for its weights and biases.  Unfortunately, the perceptron network is inherently limited. These limita- tions were widely publicized in the book Perceptrons [MiPa69] by Marvin  Minsky and Seymour Papert. They demonstrated that the perceptron net- works were incapable of implementing certain elementary functions. It  was not until the 1980s that these limitations were overcome with im- proved  multilayer  perceptron networks and associated learning rules. We  will discuss these improvements in Chapters 11 and 12.  Today the perceptron is still viewed as an important network. It remains a  fast and reliable network for the class of problems that it can solve. In ad- dition, an understanding of the operations of the perceptron provides a  good basis for understanding more complex networks. Thus, the perceptron  network, and its associated learning rule, are well worth discussing here.  In the remainder of this chapter we will define what we mean by a learning  rule, explain the perceptron network and learning rule, and discuss the  limitations of the perceptron network.  Learning Rules  Learning Rule  As we begin our presentation of the perceptron learning rule, we want to  discuss learning rules in general. By learning rule we mean a procedure for  modifying the weights and biases of a network.  This procedure may also   4-2   Perceptron Architecture  be referred to as a training algorithm.  The purpose of the learning rule is  to train the network to perform some task. There are many types of neural  network learning rules. They fall into three broad categories: supervised  learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement  or graded  learning.   Supervised Learning Training Set  In supervised learning, the learning rule is provided with a set of examples   the training set  of proper network behavior:  Target  Reinforcement Learning  Unsupervised Learning  4  p1 t 1 { , }    { , }   pQ tQ p2 t2 { , }      ,   4.1   pq   is an input to the network and   where   target  output. As the inputs are applied to the network, the network out- puts are compared to the targets. The learning rule is then used to adjust  the weights and biases of the network in order to move the network outputs  closer to the targets. The perceptron learning rule falls in this supervised  learning category. We will also investigate supervised learning algorithms  in Chapters 7–14.   is the corresponding correct   tq  Reinforcement learning is similar to supervised learning, except that, in- stead of being provided with the correct output for each network input, the  algorithm is only given a grade. The grade  or score  is a measure of the net- work performance over some sequence of inputs. This type of learning is  currently much less common than supervised learning. It appears to be  most suited to control system applications  see [BaSu83], [WhSo92] .  In unsupervised learning, the weights and biases are modified in response  to network inputs only. There are no target outputs available. At first  glance this might seem to be impractical. How can you train a network if  you don’t know what it is supposed to do? Most of these algorithms perform  some kind of clustering operation. They learn to categorize the input pat- terns into a finite number of classes. This is especially useful in such appli- cations as vector quantization. We will see in Chapters 15–19 that there  are a number of unsupervised learning algorithms.  Perceptron Architecture  Before we present the perceptron learning rule, let’s expand our investiga- tion of the perceptron network, which we began in Chapter 3. The general  perceptron network is shown in Figure 4.1.  The output of the network is given by  a  =  hardlim Wp b+      .   4.2    Note that in Chapter 3 we used the   transfer function, instead of  hardlim. This does not affect the capabilities of the network. See Exercise  E4.10.   hardlims  4-3   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  Input  Hard Limit Layer  p R x 1  1  S x R  n cid:0 W  cid:0 b  cid:0   S x 1  S x 1  a  cid:0  cid:0  S x 1  cid:0  cid:0  S cid:0  cid:0   R  a = hardlim  Wp + b   Figure 4.1  Perceptron Network  W  =  w1 1 w1 2  w1 R w2 1 w2 2  w2 R    wS 1 wS 2  wS R  .  It will be useful in our development of the perceptron learning rule to be  able to conveniently reference individual elements of the network output.  Let’s see how this can be done. First, consider the network weight matrix:   4.3    4.4    4.5   We will define a vector composed of the elements of the ith row of   W  :  Now we can partition the weight matrix:  wi  =  W  =  .  .  wi 1 wi 2  wi R  wT 1 wT 2  wT S  This allows us to write the ith element of the network output vector as  ai  =  hardlim ni    =  hardlim wT    i  p bi+    .   4.6   4-4   Perceptron Architecture  a = hardlim  n   Recall that the   hardlim   transfer function  shown at left  is defined as:  a  =  hardlim n   =      0  1 if n 0 otherwise.   4.7   n = Wp + b  Therefore, if the inner product of the ith row of the weight matrix with the  input vector is greater than or equal to  , the output will be 1, otherwise  the output will be 0. Thus each neuron in the network divides the input  space into two regions. It is useful to investigate the boundaries between  these regions. We will begin with the simple case of a single-neuron percep- tron with two inputs.  bi–  Single-Neuron Perceptron Let’s consider a two-input perceptron with one neuron, as shown in Figure  4.2.   4  Inputs  Two-Input Neuron  p1  p2   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w1,1 n  cid:0  cid:0  w1,2  b   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   1  a = hardlim  Wp + b   Figure 4.2  Two-Input Single-Output Perceptron  The output of this network is determined by  a  =  hardlim n   =  hardlim Wp b+      =  hardlim wT    p b+    =  1  hardlim w1 1 p1 w1 2 p2  +    +  b    Decision Boundary  The decision boundary is determined by the input vectors for which the net  input    is zero:  n  n  =  wT  1  p b+  =  w1 1 p1 w1 2 p2  +  +  b  =  0  .  To make the example more concrete, let’s assign the following values for  the weights and bias:  w1 1  1=  ,   w1 2  1=  ,   b  1–=  .   4.10    4.8    4.9   4-5   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  The decision boundary is then  n  =  wT  1  p b+  =  w1 1 p1 w1 2 p2  +  +  b  =  p1  +  p2  1–  =  0  .   4.11   This defines a line in the input space. On one side of the line the network  output will be 0; on the line and on the other side of the line the output will  be 1. To draw the line, we can find the points where it intersects the   and  p2   axes. To find the    intercept set   0=  p1  p2  p1  :  p2  =  –  b ---------- w1 2  =  1– ------– 1  =  1  if p1  0=  To find the   p1   intercept, set   p2  0=  :  p1  =  –  b ---------- w1 1  =  1– ------– 1  =  1  if p2  0=  .  .   4.12    4.13   The resulting decision boundary is illustrated in Figure 4.3.  To find out which side of the boundary corresponds to an output of 1, we  just need to test one point. For the input  , the network output  will be  2 0  p  =  T  a  =  hardlim wT    p b+    1  =  hardlim 1 1  =  1  .   4.14         1–   2 0  Therefore, the network output will be 1 for the region above and to the right  of the decision boundary. This region is indicated by the shaded area in Fig- ure 4.3.  p2  a = 1  1w  1wTp + b = 0  1  a = 0  1  p1  4-6  Figure 4.3  Decision Boundary for Two-Input Perceptron   Perceptron Architecture  1w  1w  We can also find the decision boundary graphically. The first step is to note  that the boundary is always orthogonal to  , as illustrated in the adjacent  figures. The boundary is defined by  w1  wT 1  p b+  0=  .   4.15   For all points on the boundary, the inner product of the input vector with  the weight vector is the same. This implies that these input vectors will all  have the same projection onto the weight vector, so they must lie on a line  orthogonal to the weight vector.  These concepts will be covered in more de- tail in Chapter 5.  In addition, any vector in the shaded region of Figure 4.3  will have an inner product greater than  , and vectors in the unshaded  b– region will have inner products less than  . Therefore the weight vector  w1 After we have selected a weight vector with the correct angular orientation,  the bias value can be computed by selecting a point on the boundary and  satisfying Eq.  4.15 .   will always point toward the region where the neuron output is 1.   b–  4  2 2+  Let’s apply some of these concepts to the design of a perceptron network to  implement a simple logic function: the AND gate. The input target pairs for  the AND gate are      0 0  p1  =    t1  0=  p2  =    t2  0=  p3  =    t3  0=  p4  =    t4  1=          0 1          1 0          1 1  .      The figure to the left illustrates the problem graphically. It displays the in- put space, with each input vector labeled according to its target. The dark  circles   indicate that  the target is 0.   indicate that the target is 1, and the light circles   The first step of the design is to select a decision boundary. We want to  have a line that separates the dark circles and the light circles. There are  an infinite number of solutions to this problem. It seems reasonable to  choose the line that falls “halfway” between the two categories of inputs, as  shown in the adjacent figure.  Next we want to choose a weight vector that is orthogonal to the decision  boundary. The weight vector can be any length, so there are infinite possi- bilities. One choice is   1w  AND  w1  =  ,  2 2   4.16   as displayed in the figure to the left.  4-7   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  Finally, we need to find the bias,  the decision boundary and satisfying Eq.  4.15 .

The decision boundary for  neuron    will be defined by  i  wT i  p bi+  0=  .   4.19   A single-neuron perceptron can classify input vectors into two categories,  since its output can be either 0 or 1. A multiple-neuron perceptron can clas- sify inputs into many categories. Each category is represented by a differ- ent output vector. Since each element of the output vector can be either 0  or 1, there are a total of   is the number of  neurons.   possible categories, where   2S  S  Perceptron Learning Rule  Now that we have examined the performance of perceptron networks, we  are in a position to introduce the perceptron learning rule. This learning  rule is an example of supervised training, in which the learning rule is pro- vided with a set of examples of proper network behavior:  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }  pQ tQ  {      ,  }  ,   4.20   4-8   Perceptron Learning Rule  pq   is an input to the network and   where  put. As each input is applied to the network, the network output is com- pared to the target. The learning rule then adjusts the weights and biases  of the network in order to move the network output closer to the target.    is the corresponding target out-  tq  Test Problem In our presentation of the perceptron learning rule we will begin with a  simple test problem and will experiment with possible rules to develop  some intuition about how the rule should work. The input target pairs for  our test problem are      1 2  p1  =    t1  1=  p2  =    t2  0=  p3  =    t3  0=          1– 2          0 1–  .      4  The problem is displayed graphically in the adjacent figure, where the two  input vectors whose target is 0 are represented with a light circle  , and  the vector whose target is 1 is represented with a dark circle  . This is a  very simple problem, and we could almost obtain a solution by inspection.  This simplicity will help us gain some intuitive understanding of the basic  concepts of the perceptron learning rule.  The network for this problem should have two-inputs and one output. To  simplify our development of the learning rule, we will begin with a network  without a bias. The network will then have just two parameters,   and  w1 2  , as shown in Figure 4.4.  w1 1  Inputs  No-Bias Neuron  p1  p2   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w1,1 n  cid:0  cid:0  w1,2   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   a = hardlim Wp   Figure 4.4  Test Problem Network  By removing the bias we are left with a network whose decision boundary  must pass through the origin. We need to be sure that this network is still  able to solve the test problem. There must be an allowable decision bound- ary that can separate the vectors  . The figure  to the left illustrates that there are indeed an infinite number of such  boundaries.    from the vector    and   p1  p3  p2  4-9  1  2  3  1  2   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   3   1  2   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   3  1  2  1w  3  4 Perceptron Learning Rule  The adjacent figure shows the weight vectors that correspond to the allow- able decision boundaries.  Recall that the weight vector is orthogonal to the  decision boundary.  We would like a learning rule that will find a weight  vector that points in one of these directions. Remember that the length of  the weight vector does not matter; only its direction is important.  Constructing Learning Rules Training begins by assigning some initial values for the network parame- ters. In this case we are training a two-input single-output network with- out a bias, so we only have to initialize its two weights. Here we set the  elements of the weight vector,  ues:  , to the following randomly generated val-  w1  wT 1  =  1.0 0.8–  .   4.21   We will now begin presenting the input vectors to the network. We begin  with   :  p1  a  =  hardlim wT    1  p1    =  hardlim 1.0 0.8–          1 2  a  =  hardlim 0.6–    =  0 .   4.22   The network has not returned the correct value. The network output is 0,  while the target response,   , is 1.  t1  p1  , so that in the future it has a better chance of classifying it correctly.   We can see what happened by looking at the adjacent diagram. The initial  weight vector results in a decision boundary that incorrectly classifies the  vector  .

Unfortunately, it is easy  to construct a problem for which this rule cannot find a solution. The dia- gram to the lower left shows a problem that cannot be solved with the  weight vector pointing directly at either of the two class 1 vectors. If we ap- ply the rule   every time one of these vectors is misclassified, the net- work’s weights will simply oscillate back and forth and will never find a  solution.   equal to   p=  w1  w1  p1  p1   point more in the direction of   Another possibility would be to add  w1 p1 cause the direction of  w1 This rule can be stated:   to   p1 .

We now move on to the next input vector and will continue making changes  to the weights and cycling through the inputs until they are all classified  correctly.  The next input vector is   . When it is presented to the network we find:  p2  2  1  1w  3  a  =  hardlim wT    1  p2    =  hardlim 2.0 1.2      1– 2      =  hardlim 0.4    =  1 .  4   4.25   1  2  3  1w  The target  was misclassified as a 1.   associated with   t2  p2   is 0 and the output a is 1. A class 0 vector   Since we would now like to move the weight vector  we can simply change the addition in Eq.  4.23  to subtraction:  w1   away from the input,   If t  =  0 and a  =  1, then  w1  new  =  w1  old p–  .   4.26   If we apply this to the test problem we find:  new  w1  =  w1  old p2–  =  2.0 1.2  –  1– 2  =  3.0 0.8–  ,   4.27   which is illustrated in the adjacent figure.

The current  is a situation for which we already have a rule, so  according to Eq.  4.26 :   results in a decision boundary that misclassifies   .

If we present any of the input vectors to  the neuron, it will output the correct class for that input vector.  This brings us to our third and final rule: if it works, don’t fix it.  If t  =  a, then   w1  new  =  old.  w1   4.30   Here are the three rules, which cover all possible combinations of output  and target values:  If t  =  1 and a  =  If t  =  0 and a  =  new  new  =  =  0, then  w1 1, then  w1 new  w1 w1 old.  old p.+ old p.–  If t  =  a, then   w1  =  w1  Unified Learning Rule The three rules in Eq.  4.31  can be rewritten as a single expression. First  we will define a new variable, the perceptron error e:  We can now rewrite the three rules of Eq.  4.31  as:  e  a–=  t  .   4.31    4.32    4.33   If e  =  If e  =  If e  new  1, then  w1 1,–  then  w1 0, then  w1 =  = new  w1 w1 = new w1 =  old p . + old p– old  .      .  p   is the same as the sign on the error, e. Furthermore, the absence of   Looking carefully at the first two rules in Eq.  4.33  we can see that the sign  of    p in the third rule corresponds to an e of 0. Thus, we can unify the three rules  into a single expression:  new  w1  =  w1  old  ep+  =  old  w1  +  a– t  p  .   4.34   This rule can be extended to train the bias by noting that a bias is simply  a weight whose input is always 1. We can thus replace the input   in Eq.   4.34  with the input to the bias, which is 1. The result is the perceptron  rule for a bias:  p  bnew  =  bold  e+  .   4.35   4-12   Perceptron Learning Rule  Training Multiple-Neuron Perceptrons The perceptron rule, as given by Eq.  4.34  and Eq.  4.35 , updates the  weight vector of a single neuron perceptron. We can generalize this rule for  the multiple-neuron perceptron of Figure 4.1 as follows. To update the ith  row of the weight matrix use:  To update the ith element of the bias vector use:  new  wi  =  wi  old  eip+  .  new  bi  =  bi  old  ei+  .  Wnew Wold  =  +  epT  ,  bnew  =  bold  e+  .   4.36    4.37    4.38    4.39   4  and  Perceptron Rule  The perceptron rule can be written conveniently in matrix notation:  2 2+  To test the perceptron learning rule, consider again the apple orange rec- ognition problem of Chapter 3.

This is because we are using the  hardlim   transfer function, instead of   hardlims  .   Typically the weights and biases are initialized to small random numbers.  Suppose that here we start with the initial weight matrix and bias:  W  =  0.5 1–  0.5–  ,   b  =  0.5  .   4.41   The first step is to apply the first input vector,   , to the network:  p1  a  =  hardlim Wp1    b+    =  hardlim 0.5 1–  0.5–        1 1– 1–     0.5+    =  hardlim 2.5    =  1   4.42   4-13   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  Then we calculate the error:  The weight update is  e  =  t1  a–  =  0  1–  =  1–  .  Wnew Wold  =  +  epT  =  0.5 1–  0.5–  +  1–   1 1–  1–  =  0.5–  0 0.5  .  The bias update is  bnew  =  bold  e+  =  0.5  +  1–    =  0.5–  .   4.45   This completes the first iteration.  The second iteration of the perceptron rule is:  a  =  hardlim  Wp2     b+    =  hardlim      0.5–  0 0.5  +  0.5–      =  hardlim  0.5–      =  0  e  =  t2  a–  =  1  0–  =  1  Wnew Wold  =  +  epT  =  0.5–  0 0.5  +  1 1 1 1–  =  0.5 1 0.5–  bnew  =  bold  e+  =  –  0.5  1+  =  0.5  The third iteration begins again with the first input vector:  1 1 1–  1 1– 1–  a  =  hardlim  Wp1     b+     =  hardlim  0.5 1 0.5–     0.5+     =  hardlim  0.5      =  1  e  =  t1  a–  =  0  1–  =  1–  Wnew Wold  =  +  epT  =  0.5 1 0.5–  +  1–   1 1–  1–  =  0.5–  2 0.5  4-14   4.43    4.44    4.46    4.47    4.48    4.49    4.50    4.51    4.52    Proof of Convergence  bnew  =  bold  e+  =  0.5  +  1–    =  0.5–  .   4.53   If you continue with the iterations you will find that both input vectors will  now be correctly classified. The algorithm has converged to a solution. Note  that the final decision boundary is not the same as the one we developed in  Chapter 3, although both boundaries correctly classify the two input vec- tors.   To experiment with the perceptron learning rule, use the Neural Network  Design Demonstration Perceptron Rule  nnd4pr .  Proof of Convergence  Although the perceptron learning rule is simple, it is quite powerful. In  fact, it can be shown that the rule will always converge to weights that ac- complish the desired classification  assuming that such weights exist . In  this section we will present a proof of convergence for the perceptron learn- ing rule for the single-neuron perceptron shown in Figure 4.5.   4  Inputs  Hard Limit Neuron  p1 p2p3  pR  w1,1  cid:0 Σ  cid:0  w1,R b 1  n  a   cid:0   cid:0   a = hardlim  1wTp + b   Figure 4.5  Single-Neuron Perceptron  The output of this perceptron is obtained from  a  =  hardlim wT    p b+    .  1  The network is provided with the following examples of proper network be- havior:  p1 t1 { , }    { , }  pQ tQ p2 t2 { , }      .  where each target output,   , is either   0   or   1  .  tq  Notation To conveniently present the proof we will first introduce some new nota- tion.

The objective of the proof is to find upper and lower bounds on the  length of the weight vector at each stage of the algorithm.  4-16   4.56    4.57    4.58    4.59    4.60    4.61    4.62    4.63    Proof of Convergence  Assume that the algorithm is initialized with the zero weight vector:  x 0  k   iterations  changes to the weight vector , we find from Eq.  4.60 :  .

If we combine Eq.  4.67  and Eq.  4.68  we can put a lower bound on the  squared length of the weight vector at iteration   k  :  Next we want to find an upper bound for the length of the weight vector.  We begin by finding the change in the length at iteration   k  :  x k  2  =  xT k x k   =    1– x k    +  z' k  1–    T x k  1–      +  z' k  1–      =  xT k  1–  x k  1–    +  2xT k  1–  z' k  1–     4.71   z'T k  1–  +  z' k  1–    xT k  1–  z' k  1–    0  ,   4.72   Note that   4-17  4   4.66    4.67    4.68    4.69    4.70    4 Perceptron Learning Rule  since the weights would not be updated unless the previous input vector  had been misclassified.

Therefore, the perceptron learning rule  will converge in a finite number of iterations.   The maximum number of iterations  changes to the weight vector  is in- versely related to the square of  . This parameter is a measure of how close  the solution decision boundary is to the input patterns. This means that if  the input classes are difficult to separate  are close to the decision bound- ary  it will take many iterations for the algorithm to converge.    Note that there are only three key assumptions required for the proof:  1. A solution to the problem exists, so that Eq.  4.66  is satisfied.   2. The weights are only updated when the input vector is misclassified,   therefore Eq.  4.72  is satisfied.   3. An upper bound,     , exists for the length of the input vectors.   Because of the generality of the proof, there are many variations of the per- ceptron learning rule that can also be shown to converge.  See Exercise  E4.13.   Limitations The perceptron learning rule is guaranteed to converge to a solution in a  finite number of steps, so long as a solution exists. This brings us to an im- portant question. What problems can a perceptron solve? Recall that a sin-  4-18   Linear Separability  Proof of Convergence  gle-neuron perceptron is able to divide the input space into two regions.  The boundary between the regions is defined by the equation  wT 1  p b+  0=  .   4.77   This is a linear boundary  hyperplane . The perceptron can be used to clas- sify input vectors that can be separated by a linear boundary. We call such  vectors linearly separable. The logical AND gate example on page 4-7 illus- trates a two-dimensional example of a linearly separable problem. The ap- ple orange recognition problem of Chapter 3 was a three-dimensional  example.  Unfortunately, many problems are not linearly separable. The classic ex- ample is the XOR gate.

Rosenblatt had investigated more complex networks, which  he felt would overcome the limitations of the basic perceptron, but he was  never able to effectively extend the perceptron rule to such networks. In  Chapter 11 we will introduce multilayer perceptrons, which can solve arbi- trary classification problems, and will describe the backpropagation algo- rithm, which can be used to train them.  4-19   4 Perceptron Learning Rule  Summary of Results  Perceptron Architecture  Input  Hard Limit Layer  p R x 1  1  S x R  n cid:0 W  cid:0 b  cid:0   S x 1  S x 1  a  cid:0  cid:0  S x 1  cid:0  cid:0  S cid:0  cid:0   R  a = hardlim  Wp + b   W  =  wT 1 wT 2  wT S  a  =  hardlim Wp b+                    ai  =  hardlim ni    =  hardlim wT    i  p bi+    Decision Boundary  wT i  p bi+  0=  .

It is a type of learning called supervised learning, in which  the learning rule is provided with a set of examples of proper network be- havior. As each input is applied to the network, the learning rule adjusts  the network parameters so that the network output will move closer to the  target.  The perceptron learning rule is very simple, but it is also quite powerful.  We have shown that the rule will always converge to a correct solution, if  such a solution exists. The weakness of the perceptron network lies not  with the learning rule, but with the structure of the network. The standard  perceptron is only able to classify vectors that are linearly separable. We  will see in Chapter 11 that the perceptron architecture can be generalized  to multilayer perceptrons, which can solve arbitrary classification prob- lems. The backpropagation learning rule, which is introduced in Chapter  11, can be used to train these networks.  In Chapters 3 and 4 we have used many concepts from the field of linear  algebra, such as inner product, projection, distance  norm , etc. We will find  in later chapters that a good foundation in linear algebra is essential to our  understanding of all neural networks. In Chapters 5 and 6 we will review  some of the key concepts from linear algebra that will be most important in  our study of neural networks. Our objective will be to obtain a fundamental  understanding of how neural networks work.  4-34   Further Reading  Further Reading  [BaSu83]  [Brog91]   W. L.

They are critical to our un- derstanding of why neural networks work.  5-1  Objectives   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  Theory and Examples  Linear algebra is the core of the mathematics required for understanding  neural networks. In Chapters 3 and 4 we saw the utility of representing the  inputs and outputs of neural networks as vectors. In addition, we saw that  it is often useful to think of the rows of a weight matrix as vectors in the  same vector space as the input vectors.   Recall from Chapter 3 that in the Hamming network the rows of the weight  matrix of the feedforward layer were equal to the prototype vectors. In fact,  the purpose of the feedforward layer was to calculate the inner products be- tween the prototype vectors and the input vector.  In the single neuron perceptron network we noted that the decision bound- ary was always orthogonal to the weight matrix  a row vector .  In this chapter we want to review the basic concepts of vector spaces  e.g.,  inner products, orthogonality  in the context of neural networks. We will  begin with a general definition of vector spaces. Then we will present the  basic properties of vectors that are most useful for neural network applica- tions.   One comment about notation before we begin. All of the vectors we have  discussed so far have been ordered n-tuples  columns  of real numbers and  are represented by bold small letters, e.g.,   x  =  x1 x2  xn  T  .   5.1   n  , the standard n-dimensional Euclidean space. In  These are vectors in  this chapter we will also be talking about more general vector spaces than  n . These more general vectors will be represented with a script typeface,  as in  . We will show in this chapter how these general vectors can often  be represented by columns of numbers.  x  Linear Vector Spaces  What do we mean by a vector space? We will begin with a very general def- inition. While this definition may seem abstract, we will provide many con- crete examples. By using a general definition we can solve a larger class of  problems, and we can impart a deeper understanding of the concepts.  Vector Space  Definition. A linear vector space,  over a scalar field,   F  , that satisfies the following conditions:  X  , is a set of elements  vectors  defined   1. An operation called vector addition is defined such that if   x X      x   is   an element of   X    and   y X  , then   x  y X+  .  5-2   Linear Vector Spaces  x  y+  =  y  x+  .  2.  3.  y+ x    z+  =  x  +  z+ y    .  x  0+  x=   for all   x X  .  5. For each vector  0=  that   x–  x  +    .  x X  4. There is a unique vector   0 X  , called the zero vector, such that    there is a unique vector in X, to be called   x–  , such   6. An operation, called multiplication, is defined such that for all scalars   a  F  , and all vectors   x X  ,   ax X  .  7. For any   x X  ,   1x  x=    for scalar   1   .  8. For any two scalars   a  F   and   b  F  , and any   x X  ,   a bx    =  ab  x  .  5  x1 x1  9.  b+ a  x  ax  bx+  .  10.  y+ a x    ax  ay+  .  =  =  To illustrate these conditions, let’s investigate a few sample sets and deter- mine whether or not they are vector spaces. First consider the standard  two-dimensional Euclidean space,  is clearly a vector space, and all ten conditions are satisfied for the stan- dard definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication.   , shown in the upper left figure. This   2  2  ? What subsets of    are also vector spaces  sub- What about subsets of  spaces ? Consider the boxed area     in the center left figure. Does it sat- isfy all ten conditions? No. Clearly even condition 1 is not satisfied. The  vectors   is not. From this  example it is clear that no bounded sets can be vector spaces.   shown in the figure are in   , but    and   y+  x  x  X  X  y  2  2   that are vector spaces? Consider the line    Are there any subsets of     shown in the bottom left figure.  Assume that the line extends to infinity in  both directions.  Is this line a vector space? We leave it to you to show that  indeed all ten conditions are satisfied. Will any such infinite line satisfy the  ten conditions? Well, any line that passes through the origin will work. If  it does not pass through the origin then condition 4, for instance, would not  be satisfied.  X  In addition to the standard Euclidean spaces, there are other sets that also  satisfy the ten conditions of a vector space. Consider, for example, the set  P2  of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to 2. Two members of this  set would be  5-3  x2 x2  ℜ2 ℜ2  x + y x + y  x x  X X  x2 x2  x1 x1  y y  X X   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  x  y     =  2  + +  t  4t2  =  1  +  5t .  If you are used to thinking of vectors only as columns of numbers, these  may seem to be strange vectors indeed. However, recall that to be a vector  space, a set need only satisfy the ten conditions we presented. Are these  conditions satisfied for the set  ? If we add two polynomials of degree less  than or equal to 2, the result will also be a polynomial of degree less than  or equal to 2. Therefore condition 1 is satisfied. We can also multiply a poly- nomial by a scalar without changing the order of the polynomial. Therefore  condition 6 is satisfied. It is not difficult to show that all ten conditions are  satisfied, showing that    is a vector space.  P2  P2  Consider the set  [0, 1]. Two members of this set would be  C 0 1     of all continuous functions defined on the interval   f t   1  t  x  y  =  sin  t   =  e 2t–  .   5.2    5.3   Another member of the set is shown in the figure to the left.  The sum of two continuous functions is also a continuous function, and a  scalar times a continuous function is a continuous function. The set    C 0 1  is also a vector space. This set is different than the other vector spaces we  have discussed; it is infinite dimensional. We will define what we mean by  dimension later in this chapter.  Linear Independence  Now that we have defined what we mean by a vector space, we will inves- tigate some of the properties of vectors. The first properties are linear de- pendence and linear independence.  Consider n vectors  least one of which is nonzero, such that  x1 x2   xn            . If there exist n scalars   a1 a2   an        , at   a1x1  +  a2x2  anxn  +  +  0=  ,   5.4   then the   xi    are linearly dependent.  Linear Independence  The converse statement would be: If  that each   , then   0=  xi   ai  a1x1  +  a2x2  anxn  +  +  0=   implies    is a set of linearly independent vectors.  5-4   Spanning a Space  Note that these definitions are equivalent to saying that if a set of vectors  is independent then no vector in the set can be written as a linear combi- nation of the other vectors.  2 2+  As an example of independence, consider the pattern recognition problem  of Chapter 3. The two prototype patterns  orange and apple  were given by:   5.5    5.6    5.7    5.8   Let   a1p1  +  a2p2  0=  , then  p1  =  ,   p2  =  1 1– 1–  .  1 1 1–  a1 a– 1 +  a2+ a2+ a2–  a– 1    =  ,  0 0 0  but this can only be true if  independent. Consider vectors from the space P2 of polynomials of degree less than or  equal to 2. Three vectors from this space would be  . Therefore    are linearly    and   p1  p2  a2  a1  =  =  0  2 2+  5  x1  =  1  + +  t  t2  ,   x2  =  2  +  2t  +  t2  ,   x3  =  1  t+  .  Note that if we let   a1  1=  ,   a2  1–=   and   a3  1=  , then  a1x1  +  a2x2  +  a3x3  0=  .  Therefore these three vectors are linearly dependent.  Spanning a Space  Next we want to define what we mean by the dimension  size  of a vector  space. To do so we must first define the concept of a spanning set.   Let X be a linear vector space and let   vectors in X. This subset spans X if and only if for every vector  x2u2  xmum exist scalars  words, a subset spans a space if every vector in the space can be written as  a linear combination of the vectors in the subset.   be a subset of general   there   x X . In other   u1 u2   um  x1 x2   xn   such that   x1u1  x  +  =  +  +                Basis Set  The dimension of a vector space is determined by the minimum number of  vectors it takes to span the space. This leads to the definition of a basis set.  A basis set for X is a set of linearly independent vectors that spans X. Any  basis set contains the minimum number of vectors required to span the   5-5   Inner Product  Inner Product  5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  space. The dimension of X is therefore equal to the number of elements in  the basis set. Any vector space can have many basis sets, but each one must  contain the same number of elements.  See [Stra80] for a proof of this fact.  Take, for example, the linear vector space P2. One possible basis for this  space is  u1  1=  ,   u2  t=  ,   u3  t2=  .   5.9   Clearly any polynomial of degree two or less can be created by taking a lin- ear combination of these three vectors. Note, however, that any three inde- pendent vectors from P2 would form a basis for this space. One such  alternate basis is:  u1  1=  ,   u2  =  1  t+  ,   u3  =  + + 2 t  t  .  1   5.10   From our brief encounter with neural networks in Chapters 3 and 4, it is  clear that the inner product is fundamental to the operation of many neural  networks. Here we will introduce a general definition for inner products  and then give several examples. Any scalar function of x and y can be defined as an inner product,  vided that the following properties are satisfied:  , pro-  x y  ,    1.  2.  x y  ,   = x ay1   , x x  ,    +  .  y x  ,   by2   , where equality holds if and only if x is the zero vector.  b x y2   ,    a x y1   ,  =  +     .  0  3. The standard inner product for vectors in Rn is  xTy  =  x1y1  +  x2y2  +   xnyn  +  ,   5.11   but this is not the only possible inner product. Consider again the set C[0, 1]  of all continuous functions defined on the interval [0, 1]. Show that the fol- lowing scalar function is man inner product  see Problem P5.6 .  x y  ,    =  x t y t dt  1  0   5.12   5-6   Norm  Norm  The next operation we need to define is the norm, which is based on the con- cept of vector length.  Norm  A scalar function    is called a norm if it satisfies the following properties:  x  0  .  1.  2.  3.  4.  x x ax x  0=   if and only if   x  0=  .   for scalar a.  = y+  a x x    y+  .  There are many functions that would satisfy these conditions. One common  norm is based on the inner product:  x  =  x x  ,  1 2  .  For Euclidean spaces,  miliar:  n  , this yields the norm with which we are most fa-  5  x  =  xTx    1 2  =  2 x1  +  2  xn + x2  +  2  .  In neural network applications it is often useful to normalize the input vec- tors. This means that    for each input vector.  1=  pi  Angle  Using the norm and the inner product we can generalize the concept of an- gle for vector spaces of dimension greater than two. The angle  between  two vectors x and y is defined by   5.13    5.14    5.15   cos  =  x y  ,   --------------- x y  .  Orthogonality  Now that we have defined the inner product operation, we can introduce  the important concept of orthogonality.  Orthogonality  Two vectors   x y  X   are said to be orthogonal if   x y  ,    0=  .   Orthogonality is an important concept in neural networks. We will see in  Chapter 7 that when the prototype vectors of a pattern recognition problem  are orthogonal and normalized, a linear associator neural network can be  trained, using the Hebb rule, to achieve perfect recognition.  In addition to orthogonal vectors, we can also have orthogonal spaces. A  vector    is orthogonal to a subspace    is orthogonal to every vec-   if   x X  X1  x  5-7   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  p3  p1  X1  X2  X1 X2  . A subspace    if every vector in   .

See Figure 3.4.  The   plane  is a subspace of   axis  which is another  3  plane was the decision boundary of a percep- subspace of  tron network.

Vector Expansions  Note that we have been using a script font     to represent general vectors  x n and bold type   , which can be written as col- umns of numbers. In this section we will show that general vectors in finite     to represent vectors in   x  5-9   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  dimensional vector spaces can also be written as columns of numbers and  therefore are in some ways equivalent to vectors in   n  .

Of course in order to in-   we need to know the basis set. If the basis set   will change, even though it still represents the same general   x . We will discuss this in more detail in the next subsection.  x  x  If the vectors in the basis set are orthogonal   easy to compute the coefficients in the expansion. We simply take the inner  product of    with both sides of Eq.  5.24 :    it is very   vi vj    0=  j  ,      i  ,  vj     vj x ,    =    vj ,  xivi     =  xi vj vi       ,  =  xj vj vj       ,  .   5.26   n  i  1=  n    i  1=  Therefore the coefficients of the expansion are given by  xj  =  vj x ,     -------------- vj vj ,      .  When the vectors in the basis set are not orthogonal, the computation of the  coefficients in the vector expansion is more complex. This case is covered in  the following subsection.  Reciprocal Basis Vectors If a vector expansion is required and the basis set is not orthogonal, the re- ciprocal basis vectors are introduced. These are defined by the following  equations:   5.27    5.28   ri vj   ,     =  0  i  j  =  1  i  j ,=  5-10   Vector Expansions  Reciprocal Basis Vectors  where the basis vectors are  are   r1 r2   rn      .          v1 v2   vn           and the reciprocal basis vectors   If the vectors have been represented by columns of numbers  through vec- tor expansion , and the standard inner product is used  then Eq.  5.28  can be represented in matrix form as  where  ri vj   ,     =  Tvj ri  ,  RTB  I=  ,  B  =  v1 v2  vn  R  =  r1 r2  rn  ,  .  RT  =  B 1–  ,  Therefore R can be found from  5  and the reciprocal basis vectors can be obtained from the columns of R.  Now consider again the vector expansion  x  =  x1v1  +  x2v2  xnvn  +  +  .  Taking the inner product of r1 with both sides of Eq.  5.34  we obtain  r1 x  ,    =  x1 r1 v1     ,     +  x2 r1 v2     ,     xn r1 vn +    +     ,  .

Condition 1 requires that when we add two  vectors together the sum remains in the vector space. Let   be two  vectors on the decision boundary. To be on the boundary they must satisfy   and   p1  p2  If we add these two equations together we find  Wp1  0=  Wp2  0=  .  Therefore the sum is also on the decision boundary.

Condition 5 implies that if   must  also be on the boundary. If    is on the boundary, then    is on the boundary, then  0= p  W0  p–  p  If we multiply both sides of this equation by -1 we find  Wp  0=  .  W p–    0=  .  Therefore condition 5 is satisfied.  5-17   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  Condition 6 will be satisfied if for any   is also on the  boundary. This can be shown in the same way as condition 5. Just multiply  both sides of the equation by    on the boundary    instead of by 1.  ap  p  a  W ap    0=  Conditions 7 through 10 are clearly satisfied. Therefore the perceptron de- cision boundary is a vector space.  P5.2 Show that the set   Y   of nonnegative    f t   0    continuous functions   is not a vector space.  This set violates several of the conditions required of a vector space. For ex- ample, there are no negative vectors, so condition 5 cannot be satisfied. Al- so, consider condition 6.

P5.3 Which of the following sets of vectors are independent? Find the   dimension of the vector space spanned by each set.  ii.  sin  t  cos  t  2  cos     ---+ t  4  i.  iii.  1 1 1  1 1 1 1  1 0 1  1 0 1 1  1 2 1  1 2 1 1  5-18  i. We can solve this problem several ways. First, let’s assume that the  vectors are dependent. Then we can write  a1  +  a2  +  a3  =  .  1 0 1  1 2 1  0 0 0  1 1 1   Solved Problems  If we can solve for the coefficients and they are not all zero, then the vectors  are dependent. By inspection we can see that if we let   and  a3 dent.  , then the equation is satisfied. Therefore the vectors are depen-  1–=  1–=  2=  a1  a2  ,   Another approach, when we have  equation in matrix form:  n   vectors in   n  , is to write the above   1 1 1 1 0 2 1 1 1  a1 a2 a3  =  0 0 0  If the matrix in this equation has an inverse, then the solution will require  that all coefficients be zero; therefore the vectors are independent. If the  matrix is singular  has no inverse , then a nonzero set of coefficients will  work, and the vectors are dependent. The test, then, is to create a matrix  using the vectors as columns. If the determinant of the matrix is zero  sin- gular matrix , then the vectors are dependent; otherwise they are indepen- dent. Using the Laplace expansion [Brog91] on the first column, the  determinant of this matrix is  5  1 1 1 1 0 2 1 1 1  =  1 0 2 1 1  +  1–   1 1 1 1  +  1 1 1 0 2  =  2–  + +  0  2  =  0  Therefore the vectors are dependent.  The dimension of the space spanned by the vectors is two, since any two of  the vectors can be shown to be independent.  ii. By using some trigonometric identities we can write  cos     ---+ t  4  1– ------- 2  =  sin  t  +  cos  t  .  1 ------- 2  Therefore the vectors are dependent. The dimension of the space spanned  by the vectors is two, since no linear combination of   is iden- tically zero.   and   cos  sin  t  t  iii. This is similar to part  i , except that the number of vectors is less than  the size of the vector space they are drawn from  three vectors in   . In  this case the matrix made up of the vectors will not be square, so we will  not be able to compute a determinant. However, we can use something  called the Gramian [Brog91]. It is the determinant of a matrix whose i, j  element is the inner product of vector i and vector j. The vectors are depen- dent if and only if the Gramian is zero.  4  5-19   5 Signal and Weight Vector Spaces  For our problem the Gramian would be  G  =         x1 x1 x2 x1 x3 x1  , , ,    x1 x2   x2 x2   x3 x2         , , ,    x1 x3   x2 x3   x3 x3         , , ,         ,  x1  =  x2  =  x3  =  .  1 0 1 1  1 2 1 1  1 1 1 1  where  Therefore  G  =  4 3 5 3 3 3 5 3 7  =  4 3 3 3 7  +  3–   3 5 3 7  +  5 3 5 3 3  =  48  18–  30–  =  0  .  We can also show that these vectors are dependent by noting  2  –  1  –  1  =  .  1 1 1 1  1 0 1 1  1 2 1 1  0 0 0 0  The dimension of the space must therefore be less than 3. We can show that  x1   are independent, since   and   x2  G  =  =  4  0  .  4 3 3 3  Therefore the dimension of the space is 2.  P5.4 Recall from Chapters 3 and 4 that one-layer perceptrons can only  be used to recognize patterns that are linearly separable  can be  separated by a linear boundary — see Figure 3.3 . If two patterns  are linearly separable, are they always linearly independent?  No, these are two unrelated concepts. Take the following simple example.

This subject of vector spaces is very large, and we have made no attempt to  cover all its aspects. Instead, we have presented those concepts that we feel  are most relevant to neural networks. The topics covered here will be revis- ited in almost every chapter that follows.  The next chapter will continue our investigation of the topics of linear al- gebra most relevant to neural networks. There we will concentrate on lin- ear transformations and matrices.  5-26   Further Reading  Further Reading  [Brog91]   W. L.

In Chapter 5 we  reviewed vector spaces; in this chapter we investigate linear transforma- tions as they apply to neural networks.  As we have seen in previous chapters, the multiplication of an input vector  by a weight matrix is one of the key operations that is performed by neural  networks. This operation is an example of a linear transformation. We  want to investigate general linear transformations and determine their  fundamental characteristics. The concepts covered in this chapter, such as  eigenvalues, eigenvectors and change of basis, will be critical to our under- standing of such key neural network topics as performance learning  in- cluding the Widrow-Hoff rule and backpropagation  and Hopfield network  convergence.  6-1   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  Theory and Examples  Recall the Hopfield network that was discussed in Chapter 3.  See Figure  6.1.  The output of the network is updated synchronously according to the  equation  1+ a t    =  satlin Wa t  b+      .   6.1   Notice that at each iteration the output of the network is again multiplied  by the weight matrix W. What is the effect of this repeated operation? Can  we determine whether or not the output of the network will converge to  some steady state value, go to infinity, or oscillate? In this chapter we will  lay the foundation for answering these questions, along with many other  questions about neural networks discussed in this book.

Transformation  A transformation consists of three parts:  1. a set of elements   X  , called the domain,  2. a set of elements   Y  , called the range, and  3. a rule relating each    to an element   yi  Y  .  =  xi  yi  = xi X  6-2   Matrix Representations  Linear Transformation  A transformation A is linear if: 1.  x2+  A ax  x1 x2 x X  for all   for all   A x1  R  X  2.  ,   ,   ,   a      =  =  A x1 aA x    A x2 + .    ,  A x    x  θ  Consider, for example, the transformation obtained by rotating vectors in  2  by an angle , as shown in the figure to the left. The next two figures  illustrate that property 1 is satisfied for rotation. They show that if you  want to rotate a sum of two vectors, you can rotate each vector first and  then sum them. The fourth figure illustrates property 2. If you want to ro- tate a scaled vector, you can rotate it first and then scale it. Therefore ro- tation is a linear operation.  Matrix Representations  x 1 + x 2  x 2  x 1  As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, matrix multiplication is  an example of a linear transformation. We can also show that any linear  transformation between two finite-dimensional vector spaces can be repre- sented by a matrix  just as in the last chapter we showed that any general  vector in a finite-dimensional vector space can be represented by a column  of numbers . To show this we will use most of the concepts covered in the  previous chapter.          v1 v2   vn  Let  a basis for vector space  y  Y     be a basis for vector space    .

When  we multiply the matrix times the vector expansion for the domain vector  ,  we obtain the vector expansion for the transformed vector   x  .   y  6-4   2 2+  A x   θ  s2  x  s1  A s1   sin θ   s1  cos θ   θ  A s2   -sin θ   s2  cos θ   θ  Matrix Representations  Keep in mind that the matrix representation is not unique  just as the rep- resentation of a general vector by a column of numbers is not unique — see  Chapter 5 . If we change the basis set for the domain or for the range, the  matrix representation will also change. We will use this fact to our advan- tage in later chapters.   As an example of a matrix representation, consider the rotation transfor- mation. Let’s find a matrix representation for that transformation. The key  step is given in Eq.  6.6 . We must transform each basis vector for the do- main and then expand it in terms of the basis vectors of the range. In this   , so to keep  example the domain and the range are the same   = things simple we will use the standard basis for both   = shown in the adjacent figure.   Y 2 vi ui   , as   = =  si  X  The first step is to transform the first basis vector and expand the resulting  transformed vector in terms of the basis vectors. If we rotate  clockwise by the angle    we obtain   counter-  s1    A s1    =  cos      s1  +  sin      s2  =  ai1si  =  a11s1  +  a21s2  ,   6.12   2    i  1=  2    i  1=  as can be seen in the middle left figure. The two coefficients in this expan- sion make up the first column of the matrix representation.  The next step is to transform the second basis vector. If we rotate  terclockwise by the angle    we obtain    s2   coun-  6  A s2    =  sin–      s1  +  cos      s2  =  ai2si  =  a12s1  +  a22s2  ,   6.13   as can be seen in the lower left figure. From this expansion we obtain the  second column of the matrix representation. The complete matrix repre- sentation is thus given by  A  =  cos sin       sin– cos       .   6.14    Verify for yourself that when you multiply a vector by the matrix of Eq.   6.14 , the vector is rotated by an angle .  In summary, to obtain the matrix representation of a transformation we  use Eq.  6.6 . We transform each basis vector for the domain and expand it  in terms of the basis vectors of the range. The coefficients of each expansion  produce one column of the matrix.  6-5   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  To graphically investigate the process of creating a matrix representation,  use the Neural Network Design Demonstration Linear Transformations   nnd6lt .  Change of Basis  We notice from the previous section that the matrix representation of a lin- ear transformation is not unique. The representation will depend on what  basis sets are used for the domain and the range of the transformation. In  this section we will illustrate exactly how a matrix representation changes  as the basis sets are changed.  Consider a linear transformation  A:X for vector space    Therefore, any vector   Y , and let  u1 u2   um    can be written x X  X      . Let   be a basis for vector space Y.   v1 v2   vn   be a basis           and any vector   Y   can be written  y  the matrix representation will be  So if   or  n  m  x  =  xivi  ,  i  1=  y  =  yiui  .  i  1=  A x   y=  x1 x2  a11 a12  a1n y1 a21 a22  a2n y2      am1 am2  amn ym  xn  =  ,  Ax  y=  .  6-6  Now suppose that we use different basis sets for   t1 t2   tn basis for    . With the new basis sets, the vector    be the new basis for   , and let    Y  X         and   X w1 w2   wm    is written x X  . Let    Y    be the new    6.15    6.16    6.17    6.18    6.19    Change of Basis  and the vector   Y   is written  y  This produces a new matrix representation:  x'1 x'2  a'11 a'12  a'1n y'1 a'21 a'22  a'2n y'2      a'm1 a'm2  a'mn y'm  x'n  =  ,  or  x  =  x'iti  ,  n  i  1=  y  =  y'iwi  .  m  i  1=  A'x'  y'=  .  ti  =  tjivj  .  j  1=  n  m  wi  =  wjiuj  .  j  1=  What is the relationship between  the relationship between the two basis sets. First, since each  ment of   , they can be expanded in terms of the original basis for   ? To find out, we need to find   is an ele-   and   A'  ti  A  X  X  :  6  Next, since each  the original basis for   wi  Y  :   is an element of   Y  , they can be expanded in terms of    6.20    6.21    6.22    6.23    6.24    6.25    6.26   Therefore, the basis vectors can be written as columns of numbers:  ti  =  wi  =  t1i t2i  tni  .  w1i w2i  wmi  Define a matrix whose columns are the ti:  6-7   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  Bt  =  t1 t2  tn  .  Then we can write Eq.  6.20  in matrix form:  x  =  x'1t1  +  x'2t2  +   x'ntn  +  =  Btx'  .  This equation demonstrates the relationships between the two different  representations for the vector  .  Note that this is effectively the same as  Eq.  5.43 . You may want to revisit our discussion of reciprocal basis vec- tors in Chapter 5.  Now define a matrix whose columns are the wi:  x  This allows us to write Eq.  6.21  in matrix form,  Bw  =  w1 w2  wm  .  y  =  Bwy'  ,  which then demonstrates the relationships between the two different rep- resentations for the vector y. Now substitute Eq.  6.28  and Eq.  6.30  into Eq.  6.19 :  If we multiply both sides of this equation by   1– Bw   we obtain   6.27    6.28    6.29    6.30    6.31    6.32    6.33   ABtx'  =  Bwy'  .    1– ABt Bw  x'  y'=  .  A'  =    1– ABt Bw    .  Change of Basis  A comparison of Eq.  6.32  and Eq.  6.23  yields the following operation for  a change of basis:  Similarity Transform  This key result, which describes the relationship between any two matrix  representations of a given linear transformation, is called a similarity  transform [Brog91]. It will be of great use to us in later chapters. It turns  out that with the right choice of basis vectors we can obtain a matrix rep- resentation that reveals the key characteristics of the linear transforma- tion it represents. This will be discussed in the next section.  As an example of changing basis sets, let’s revisit the vector rotation exam- ple of the previous section. In that section a matrix representation was de- veloped using the standard basis set  representation using the basis  t1 t2 { , }  s1 s2 { , } , which is shown in the adjacent fig-  . Now let’s find a new   2 2+  6-8   t2  s2  t1  s1  Change of Basis  ure.  Note that in this example the same basis set is used for both the do- main and the range.   The first step is to expand  in Eq.  6.24  and Eq.  6.25 . By inspection of the adjacent figure we find:   in terms of the standard basis set, as    and   t1  t2  Therefore we can write  Now we can form the matrix  t1  =  s1  +  0.5s2  ,  t2  =  s– 1  s2+  .  t1  =  1 0.5  t2  =  .  1– 1  Bt  =  t1 t2  =  1 1– 0.5 1  ,  Bw  =  Bt  =  1 1– 0.5 1  .  and, because we are using the same basis set for both the domain and the  range of the transformation,  6  We can now compute the new matrix representation from Eq.  6.33 :  A'  =    1– ABt Bw    =  1 3  =  +  sin 5 --- 6  sin  2 3 3 1– cos  2 3 2 3  –  4 3  cos sin sin  sin– cos  1 1– 0.5 1  –  1 3  sin  +  cos  .  Take, for example, the case where = 30 .  A'  =  –  1.033 0.667 0.417 0.699  ,  and   6-9   6.34    6.35    6.36    6.37    6.38    6.39    6.40    6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  A  =  0.866 0.5– 0.5 0.866  .   6.41   To check that these matrices are correct, let’s try a test vector  x  =  , which corresponds to   x'  =   6.42   .  1 0  1 0.5   Note that the vector represented by   is  t1 basis set.  The transformed test vector would be   and   x'  x  , a member of the second   y  =  Ax  =  0.866 0.5– 0.5 0.866  1 0.5  =  0.616 0.933  ,  which should correspond to  y'  =  A'x'  =  –  1.033 0.667 0.416 0.699  1 0  =  1.033 0.416  .   6.43    6.44    does correspond to  ?

The vectors are displayed in the figure  to the left. Verify graphically that the two representations,  , given  by Eq.  6.43  and Eq.  6.44 , are reasonable.   and   y'  y  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  In this final section we want to discuss two key properties of linear trans- formations: eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Knowledge of these properties  will allow us to answer some key questions about neural network perfor- mance, such as the question we posed at the beginning of this chapter, con- cerning the stability of Hopfield networks.  Eigenvalues Eigenvectors  Let’s first define what we mean by eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Consider  .  The domain is the same as the range.   a linear transformation  Those vectors   that sat- isfy   that are not equal to zero and those scalars   z X  A:X  X    6-10  t2  s2  y = A  x   t1 = x  s1   Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  A z    z=   6.46   are called eigenvectors    , respectively. Notice that  the term eigenvector is a little misleading, since it is not really a vector but  a vector space, since if    satisfies Eq.  6.46 , then    will also satisfy it.    and eigenvalues    z    az  z   Therefore an eigenvector of a given transformation represents a direction,  such that any vector in that direction, when transformed, will continue to  point in the same direction, but will be scaled by the eigenvalue. As an ex- ample, consider again the rotation example used in the previous sections.  Is there any vector that, when rotated by 30 , continues to point in the  same direction? No; this is a case where there are no real eigenvalues.  If  we allow complex scalars, then two eigenvalues exist, as we will see later.   How can we compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors? Suppose that a ba- sis has been chosen for the n-dimensional vector space  . Then the matrix  representation for Eq.  6.46  can be written  X  s2  A x   θ  x  s1  or  or  Az  z=  ,    A I–  z  0=  .    A I–    0=  .  This means that the columns of   determinant of this matrix must be zero:  A I–     are dependent, and therefore the   6  This determinant is an nth-order polynomial. Therefore Eq.  6.49  always  has   roots, some of which may be complex and some of which may be re- peated.  n  2 2+  As an example, let’s revisit the rotation example. If we use the standard ba- sis set, the matrix of the transformation is  We can then write Eq.  6.49  as  A  =  cos sin  sin– cos  .  cos  –  sin  sin– cos –  0=  ,  2  –  2  cos  +      cos  2  +  sin  2    =  2  –  2  cos  1+  =  0  .   6.52   6-11   6.47    6.48    6.49    6.50    6.51    6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  The roots of this equation are  1  =  cos  +  j  sin  2  =  cos  –  j  sin  .   6.53   Therefore, as we predicted, this transformation has no real eigenvalues  if  sin point in a new direction.   . This means that when any real vector is transformed, it will   0  2 2+  Consider another matrix:  To find the eigenvalues we must solve  A  =  1– 0  1 2–  .  – 1– 0  1 – 2–  0=  ,   6.54    6.55    6.56    6.57    6.58    6.59    6.60   or  or  2  +  3 2  +  =   1+    2+    =  0  ,  and the eigenvalues are  1  1–=  2  2–=  .  To find the eigenvectors we must solve Eq.  6.48 , which in this example be- comes  We will solve this equation twice, once using  ning with    we have  1  1   and once using   2  .

Is a projection a linear   transformation?  The projection of a vector    onto a vector    is computed as  v  x  where   x v  ,     is the inner product of   x   with   y  =  A x   =  ,  x v  ,   -----------v v v  ,   .  v  We need to check to see if this transformation satisfies the two conditions  for linearity. Let’s start with condition 1:  A x1    x2+    =  x1 v   ,   -------------------------v  x2+ v v  ,    =  +  x1 v x2 v ,       ,   ----------------------------------v v v  ,    =  x1 v   ,   --------------v v v  ,    +  x2 v   ,   --------------v v v  ,    =  A x1   A x2 +  .   Here we used linearity properties of inner products.  Checking condition 2:  A ax    =  ax v   ,   ---------------v v v  ,    =  a x v  ,   ---------------v v v  ,    =  aA x   .  Therefore projection is a linear operation.  P6.3 Consider the transformation    about the line   2 trix of this transformation relative to the standard basis in    created by reflecting a vector    in  , as shown in Figure P6.2.

Each time we do the ex- pansion we get one column of the matrix representation. In this case the  basis set for both the domain and the range is  s1 first. If we reflect  0=  . So let’s transform   s1 s2 { , } , we find   about the line      x1  x2+  s1  A s1  = -s2  A s1    =  s2–  =  ai1si  =  a11s1  +  a21s2  =  0s1  +  1–  s2   as shown in the top left figure , which gives us the first column of the ma- trix. Next we transform   :  s2  A s2    =  s1–  =  ai2si  =  a12s1  +  a22s2  =  1–  s1  +  0s2  s1  s2  A s2  = -s1   as shown in the second figure on the left , which gives us the second col- umn of the matrix.

Let this be the vector   space  conjugation operator  i.e.,   , and let the basis for   X  X A x    be  { x=  ,  1 j+ 1 j– }  .  . Let   A:X  X   be the   i. Find the matrix of the transformation    relative to the basis   A  set given above.  ii. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transforma-  tion.  iii. Find the matrix representation for    relative to the eigen-  A  vectors as the basis vectors.  i. To find the matrix of the transformation, transform each of the basis  vectors  by finding their conjugate :  A v1    =  A 1  j+    =  1  j–  =  v2  =  a11v1  +  a21v2  =  0v1  +  1v2  ,  A v2    =  A 1  j–    =  1  j+  =  v1  =  a12v1  +  a22v2  =  1v1  +  0v2  .  This gives us the matrix representation  A  =  0 1 1 0  .  ii. To find the eigenvalues, we need to use Eq.  6.49 :  6-20   Solved Problems    A I–    =  =  2  1–  =   1–    1+    =  0  .  – 1  1 –  So the eigenvalues are:   6.48 :  1  1=  ,   2  1–=  . To find the eigenvectors, use Eq.   For     =  1  1=   this gives us    A I–  z  =  – 1  1 –  z  =  .  0 0  1– 1  1 1–  z1  =  1– 1  1 1–  z11 z21  =  ,  0 0  Therefore the first eigenvector will be  z11  =  z21  .  z1  =  ,  1 1  or  or  or any scalar multiple. For the second eigenvector we use     =  2  1–=  :  1 1 1 1  z1  =  1 1 1 1  z12 z22  =  ,  0 0  z12 Therefore the second eigenvector is  =  z– 22  .  z2  =  ,  1 1–  or any scalar multiple.  Note that while these eigenvectors can be represented as columns of num- bers, in reality they are complex numbers. For example:  z1  =  1v1  +  1v2  =  j+ 1    +  j– 1    =  2  ,  6-21  6   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  z2  =  1v1  +  1–  v2  =  j+ 1    –  j– 1    =  2j  .  Checking that these are indeed eigenvectors:  iii. To perform a change of basis we need to use Eq.  6.33 :  where  A z1    =  2   =  2  =  1z1  ,  A z2    =  2j    =  2j–  =  2z2  .  A'  =    1– ABt Bw    =  B 1– AB      ,  B  =  z1 z2  =  1 1 1 1–  .   We are using the same basis set for the range and the domain.  Therefore  we have  A'  =  0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5–  0 1 1 0  1 1 1 1–  =  1 0 0 1–  =  1 0 0 2  .  As expected from Eq.  6.69 , we have diagonalized the matrix representa- tion.  P6.5 Diagonalize the following matrix:  A  =  2 1–  2– 3  .  The first step is to find the eigenvalues:    A I–    =  =  2 5–  4+  =   1–    4–    =  0  ,  2 – 1–  2– 3 –  so the eigenvalues are   1  1=  ,   2  4=  . To find the eigenvectors,    A I–  z  =  2 – 1–  2– 3 –  z  =  .  0 0  For     =  1  =  1  6-22   Solved Problems  1 1–  2– 2  z1  =  1 1–  2– 2  z11 z21  =  ,  0 0  or  or  Therefore the first eigenvector will be  or any scalar multiple.  For     =  2  =  4  2– 1–  2– 1–  z1  =  2– 1–  2– 1–  z12 z22  =  ,  0 0  z11  =  2z21  .  z1  =  ,  2 1  z12  =  z– 22  .  z2  =  ,  1 1–  Therefore the second eigenvector will be  or any scalar multiple.  To diagonalize the matrix we use Eq.  6.69 :  A'  =  B 1– AB      ,  B  =  z1 z2  =  2 1 1 1–  .  where  Therefore we have  6-23  6   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  A'  =  1 --- 3 1 --- 3  1 --- 3 2 ---– 3  2 1–  2– 3  2 1 1 1–  =  1 0 0 4  =  1 0 0 2  .  P6.6 Consider a transformation   R2 relative to the standard basis sets is   A:R3   whose matrix representation   A  =  3 1– 0 0 0 1  .  Find the matrix for this transformation relative to the basis sets:  T  =          2 0 1    0 1– 0  0 2– 3        W  =        1 0  0 2–  .      The first step is to form the matrices  Now we use Eq.  6.33  to form the new matrix representation:  Bt  =  2 0 0 0 1– 2– 1 0 3  Bw  =  1 0 0 2–  .  A'  =    1– ABt Bw    ,  A'  =  1 0 1 ---– 2  0  3 1– 0 0 0 1  2 0 0 0 1– 2– 1 0 3  =  6 1 2 3 1 ---– 2 2  ---– 0  .  Therefore this is the matrix of the transformation with respect to the basis  sets    and   W  T  .  P6.7 Consider a transformation   A:2 2  . One basis set for   2   is given   as   V  =    v1 v2      .  i.

Consider a new basis set   W  the transformation  that  A  =    w1 w2      . Find the matrix of    relative to the basis set   W   if it is given   i. Each of the two equations gives us one column of the matrix, as defined  in Eq.  6.6 . Therefore the matrix is  ii. We can represent the  of the    basis vectors:  V  W   basis vectors as columns of numbers in terms   w1  =  1 1  w2  =  .  1 1–  6  We can now form the basis matrix that we need to perform the similarity  transform:  The new matrix representation can then be obtained from Eq.  6.33 :  Bw  =  1 1 1 1–  .  A'  =    1– ABw Bw    ,  A'  =  1 1 2 1  1 1 1 1–  =  1 --- 2 1 --- 2  1 --- 2 1 ---– 2  5 --- 2 1 ---– 2  1 --- 2 1 ---– 2  .  6-25   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  P6.8 Consider the vector space   P2  or equal to 2.

Find the matrix of this transformation relative to the basis   set   V  .  tion.  ii. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transforma-  i. The first step is to transform each of the basis vectors:  D 1   =  0  =  0 1  +  0 t  +  0 t2  ,  D t   =  1  =  1 1  +  0 t  +  0 t2  ,  D t2    =  2t  =  0 1  +  2 t  +  0 t2  .  The matrix of the transformation is then given by  D  =  0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0  .  ii. To find the eigenvalues we must solve    D I–    =  =  3–  =  0  .  – 1 0 – 2 0 – 0 0  Therefore all three eigenvalues are zero. To find the eigenvectors we need  to solve    D I–  z  =  z  =  .  – 1 0 – 2 0 – 0 0  0 0 0  For     0=   we have  0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0  z1 z2 z3  =  .  0 0 0  6-26   Solved Problems  This means that  Therefore we have a single eigenvector:     z2  =  z3  =  0  .  z  =  .  1 0 0  Therefore the only polynomial whose derivative is a scaled version of itself  is a constant  a zeroth-order polynomial .

However, we do  know how two vectors are transformed, and we do know how those vectors  can be represented in terms of the standard basis set. From Figure P6.4 we  can write the following equations:  A 2 2  =  1– 0  ,   A 1– 1  =  .  2– 1–  We then put these two equations together to form  A 2 1– 2 1  =  1– 0  2– 1–  .  6-27   6 Linear Transformations for Neural Networks  So that  A  =  1– 0  2– 1–  2 1– 2 1  1–  =  1– 0  2– 1–  1 --- 4 1 ---– 2  1 --- 4 1 --- 2  =  3 --- 4 1 --- 2  5 ---– 4 1 ---– 2  .  This is the matrix representation of the transformation with respect to the  standard basis set.

It was  proposed by Donald Hebb in 1949 as a possible mechanism for synaptic  modification in the brain and since then has been used to train artificial  neural networks.  In this chapter we will use the linear algebra concepts of the previous two  chapters to explain why Hebbian learning works. We will also show how  the Hebb rule can be used to train neural networks for pattern recognition.  7-1   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  Theory and Examples  Donald O. Hebb was born in Chester, Nova Scotia, just after the turn of the  century. He originally planned to become a novelist, and obtained a degree  in English from Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1925. Since every first- rate novelist needs to have a good understanding of human nature, he be- gan to study Freud after graduation and became interested in psychology.  He then pursued a master’s degree in psychology at McGill University,  where he wrote a thesis on Pavlovian conditioning. He received his Ph.D.  from Harvard in 1936, where his dissertation investigated the effects of  early experience on the vision of rats. Later he joined the Montreal Neuro- logical Institute, where he studied the extent of intellectual changes in  brain surgery patients. In 1942 he moved to the Yerkes Laboratories of Pri- mate Biology in Florida, where he studied chimpanzee behavior.  In 1949 Hebb summarized his two decades of research in The Organization  of Behavior [Hebb49]. The main premise of this book was that behavior  could be explained by the action of neurons. This was in marked contrast  to the behaviorist school of psychology  with proponents such as B. F. Skin- ner , which emphasized the correlation between stimulus and response and  discouraged the use of any physiological hypotheses. It was a confrontation  between a top-down philosophy and a bottom-up philosophy. Hebb stated  his approach: “The method then calls for learning as much as one can about  what the parts of the brain do  primarily the physiologist’s field , and relat- ing the behavior as far as possible to this knowledge  primarily for the psy- chologist ; then seeing what further information is to be had about how the  total brain works, from the discrepancy between  1  actual behavior and  2   the behavior that would be predicted from adding up what is known about  the action of the various parts.”  The most famous idea contained in The Organization of Behavior was the  postulate that came to be known as Hebbian learning:  “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or  persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change  takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells fir- ing B, is increased.”  This postulate suggested a physical mechanism for learning at the cellular  level. Although Hebb never claimed to have firm physiological evidence for  his theory, subsequent research has shown that some cells do exhibit Heb- bian learning. Hebb’s theories continue to influence current research in  neuroscience.  As with most historic ideas, Hebb’s postulate was not completely new, as  he himself emphasized. It had been foreshadowed by several others, includ- ing Freud. Consider, for example, the following principle of association  stated by psychologist and philosopher William James in 1890: “When two   7-2  Hebb’s Postulate   Linear Associator  brain processes are active together or in immediate succession, one of  them, on reoccurring tends to propagate its excitement into the other.”  Linear Associator  Linear Associator  Hebb’s learning law can be used in combination with a variety of neural  network architectures. We will use a very simple architecture for our initial  presentation of Hebbian learning. In this way we can concentrate on the  learning law rather than the architecture. The network we will use is the  linear associator, which is shown in Figure 7.1.  This network was intro- duced independently by James Anderson [Ande72] and Teuvo Kohonen  [Koho72].

The task of an associative memory is to learn   pairs  of prototype input output vectors:  Q  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ , }  {      .   7.3   In other words, if the network receives an input  , for  duce an output  tq= changed slightly  i.e.,  p =  . slightly  i.e.,  +  = +  q pq  =  a  a    tq  p  pq=   then it should pro-    1 2   Q    then the output should only be changed   .

First, let’s rephrase  the postulate: If two neurons on either side of a synapse are activated si- multaneously, the strength of the synapse will increase. Notice from Eq.   7.2  that the connection  synapse  between input   is the  weight  produces a positive  mathematical interpretation of the postulate could be  pj  should increase. This suggests that one   . Therefore Hebb’s postulate would imply that if a positive    and output    then   wij  wij  ai  ai  pj     jth  pjq   is the    element of the    ele- where  qth ment of the network output when the   input vector is presented to the   is a positive constant, called the learning rate. This equa- network; and  tion says that the change in the weight   is proportional to a product of  functions of the activities on either side of the synapse. For this chapter we  will simplify Eq.  7.4  to the following form   input vector  qth  pq aiq   is the   wij  ith    ;   new  wij  =  wij  old aiqpjq  +  .   7.5   Note that this expression actually extends Hebb’s postulate beyond its  strict interpretation. The change in the weight is proportional to a product  of the activity on either side of the synapse. Therefore, not only do we in- crease the weight when both   are positive, but we also increase  the weight when they are both negative. In addition, this implementation  of the Hebb rule will decrease the weight whenever   have opposite  sign.   and    and   ai  ai  pj  pj  The Hebb rule defined in Eq.  7.5  is an unsupervised learning rule. It does  not require any information concerning the target output. In this chapter  we are interested in using the Hebb rule for supervised learning, in which  the target output is known for each input vector.  We will revisit the unsu- pervised Hebb rule in Chapter 13.  For the supervised Hebb rule we substi- tute the target output for the actual output. In this way, we are telling the  algorithm what the network should do, rather than what it is currently do- ing. The resulting equation is  new  wij  =  old wij  +  tiqpjq  ,  where  learning rate    is the    tiq   element of the   ith qth  to one, for simplicity.     target vector   .  We have set the   tq  Notice that Eq.  7.6  can be written in vector notation:   7.6    7.7   Wnew Wold  =  +  T tqpq  .  7-4   The Hebb Rule  If we assume that the weight matrix is initialized to zero and then each of  the    input output pairs are applied once to Eq.  7.7 , we can write  Q  T W t1p1  =  +  t2p2  T  tQpQ +  +  T  =  T tqpq  .   7.8   Q    q  1=  This can be represented in matrix form:  W  =  t1 t2  tQ  =  TPT  ,   7.9   T p1 T p2  T pQ  where  T  =  t1 t2  tQ        P  =  p1 p2  pQ  .   7.10   Performance Analysis Let’s analyze the performance of Hebbian learning for the linear associa- tor. First consider the case where the   vectors are orthonormal  orthog- onal and unit length . If  output can be computed   is input to the network, then the network   pq  pk  a Wpk  =  =  Q      q  1=   T tqpq    pk  =   pq  tq    Tpk    .  Q  q  1=  Since the   pq   are orthonormal,  Therefore Eq.  7.11  can be rewritten    Tpk pq    =  1  =  0  q  k=  q  k.  a Wpk  =  =  tk  .  7   7.11    7.12    7.13   The output of the network is equal to the target output. This shows that, if  the input prototype vectors are orthonormal, the Hebb rule will produce the  correct output for each input.  7-5   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  But what about non-orthogonal prototype vectors? Let’s assume that each   vector is unit length, but that they are not orthogonal. Then Eq.  7.11   pq becomes  Error  a Wpk  =  =  tk  +  q  k  tq pq    Tpk    .   7.14   Because the vectors are not orthogonal, the network will not produce the  correct output. The magnitude of the error will depend on the amount of  correlation between the prototype input patterns.  2 2+  As an example, suppose that the prototype input output vectors are          0.5 0.5– 0.5 0.5–  1 1–                  0.5 0.5 0.5– 0.5–  1 1  .          p1  =  t1  =  p2  =  t2  =   7.15    Check that the two input vectors are orthonormal.

The outputs of the network are equal to the targets.   Pseudoinverse Rule  2 2+  Now let’s revisit the apple and orange recognition problem described in  Chapter 3. Recall that the prototype inputs were  p1  =    orange    p2  =    apple    .   7.19   1 1– 1–  1 1 1–   Note that they are not orthogonal.  If we normalize these inputs and  choose as desired outputs -1 and 1, we obtain        p1  =  0.5774 – 0.5774 0.5774 –  t1  =  1–  p2  =  t2  =  1   7.20               0.5774 0.5774 0.5774 –  .        Our weight matrix becomes  W TPT  =  =  1– 1  –  0.5774 0.5774 0.5774 0.5774  – –  0.5774 0.5774  =  0 1.1548 0  .   7.21   So, if we use our two prototype patterns,  Wp1  =  0 1.1548 0  =  –  0.6668  ,   7.22   0.5774 – 0.5774 0.5774 –  0.5774 0.5774 0.5774 –  7  Wp2  =  0 1.1548 0  =  0.6668  .   7.23   The outputs are close, but do not quite match the target outputs.  Pseudoinverse Rule  When the prototype input patterns are not orthogonal, the Hebb rule pro- duces some errors. There are several procedures that can be used to reduce  these errors. In this section we will discuss one of those procedures, the  pseudoinverse rule.   Recall that the task of the linear associator was to produce an output of  for an input of   . In other words,  tq     pq  Wpq  tq=  q  =  1 2   Q       .   7.24   7-7   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  If it is not possible to choose a weight matrix so that these equations are  exactly satisfied, then we want them to be approximately satisfied. One ap- proach would be to choose the weight matrix to minimize the following per- formance index:  F W    tq Wpq  –  2  .  Q  =  q  1=  pq  If the prototype input vectors   are orthonormal and we use the Hebb rule  to find W, then F W  will be zero. When the input vectors are not orthogo- nal and we use the Hebb rule, then F W  will be not be zero, and it is not  clear that F W  will be minimized. It turns out that the weight matrix that  will minimize F W  is obtained by using the pseudoinverse matrix, which  we will define next.  First, let’s rewrite Eq.  7.24  in matrix form:  WP  T=  ,  T  =  t1 t2  tQ  P  =  p1 p2  pQ  .  Then Eq.  7.25  can be written  F W    =  T WP  –  2  =  E 2  ,  where  where  and  Note that F W  can be made zero if we can solve Eq.  7.26 .

The pseudoinverse of a real   is the unique matrix that satisfies  PP+P P+PP+  =  =  P, P+,  P+P  PP+  =  =  P+P  T  ,  PP+    T  .   7.33   When the number, R, of rows of  Q, of  be computed by  , and the columns of   P  P  P   is greater than the number of columns,   are independent, then the pseudoinverse can   P+  =  PTP   1– PT  .   7.34   2 2+  To test the pseudoinverse rule  Eq.  7.32  , consider again the apple and or- ange recognition problem. Recall that the input output prototype vectors  are        1 1– 1–              1 1 1–  .        p1  =  t1  =  1–  p2  =  t2  =  1   7.35   7   Note that we do not need to normalize the input vectors when using the  pseudoinverse rule.   The weight matrix is calculated from Eq.  7.32 :  W TP+  =  =  1– 1   7.36         1 1 1– 1 1– 1–   +      ,  where the pseudoinverse is computed from Eq.  7.34 :  P+  =  PTP   1– PT  =  1–  3 1 1 3  1 1– 1 1  1– 1–  =  0.25 0.5– 0.25 0.5  – –  0.25 0.25  .   7.37   7-9   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  This produces the following weight matrix:  W TP+  =  =  1– 1  0.25 0.5– 0.25 0.5  – –  0.25 0.25  =  0 1 0  .   7.38   Let’s try this matrix on our two prototype patterns.  Wp1  =  0 1 0  =  1–  Wp2  =  0 1 0  =  1  1 1– 1–  1 1 1–   7.39    7.40   The network outputs exactly match the desired outputs. Compare this re- sult with the performance of the Hebb rule. As you can see from Eq.  7.22   and Eq.  7.23 , the Hebbian outputs are only close, while the pseudoinverse  rule produces exact results.  Now let’s see how we might use the Hebb rule on a practical, although  greatly oversimplified, pattern recognition problem. For this problem we  will use a special type of associative memory — the autoassociative memo- ry. In an autoassociative memory the desired output vector is equal to the  input vector  i.e.,   . We will use an autoassociative memory to store  a set of patterns and then to recall these patterns, even when corrupted  patterns are provided as input.  pq=  tq  The patterns we want to store are shown to the left.  Since we are designing  an autoassociative memory, these patterns represent the input vectors and  the targets.  They represent the digits {0, 1, 2} displayed in a 6X5 grid. We  need to convert these digits to vectors, which will become the prototype pat- terns for our network. Each white square will be represented by a “-1”, and  each dark square will be represented by a “1”. Then, to create the input vec- tors, we will scan each 6X5 grid one column at a time. For example, the first  prototype pattern will be  p1  =  1– 1 1 1 1 1– 1 1–  1–  1–  1– 1 1 1–  1 1–  T  .   7.41   The vector  digit “2”. Using the Hebb rule, the weight matrix is computed   corresponds to the digit “0”,    to the digit “1”, and   p2  p1  p3   to the   7-10  Application  Autoassociative Memory  p1,t1 p2,t2 p3,t3   Application  W p1p1  =  T p2p2 +  T p3p3 +  T  .   7.42    Note that   pq   replaces   tq   in Eq.  7.8 , since this is autoassociative memory.   Because there are only two allowable values for the elements of the proto- type vectors, we will modify the linear associator so that its output ele- ments can only take on values of “-1” or “1”. We can do this by replacing  the linear transfer function with a symmetrical hard limit transfer func- tion. The resulting network is displayed in Figure 7.2.  Inputs  p 30x1  Sym.

We will provide the net- work with corrupted versions of the prototype patterns and then check the  network output. In the first test, which is shown in Figure 7.3, the network  is presented with a prototype pattern in which the lower half of the pattern  is occluded. In each case the correct pattern is produced by the network.  7  Figure 7.3  Recovery of 50% Occluded Patterns  In the next test we remove even more of the prototype patterns. Figure 7.4  illustrates the result of removing the lower two-thirds of each pattern. In  this case only the digit “1” is recovered correctly. The other two patterns  produce results that do not correspond to any of the prototype patterns.  This is a common problem in associative memories. We would like to design  networks so that the number of such spurious patterns would be mini- mized. We will come back to this topic again in Chapter 18, when we dis- cuss recurrent associative memories.  7-11   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  Figure 7.4  Recovery of 67% Occluded Patterns  In our final test we will present the autoassociative network with noisy ver- sions of the prototype pattern. To create the noisy patterns we will random- ly change seven elements of each pattern. The results are shown in Figure  7.5. For these examples all of the patterns were correctly recovered.  Figure 7.5  Recovery of Noisy Patterns  To experiment with this type of pattern recognition problem, use the Neural  Network Design Demonstration Supervised Hebb  nnd7sh .  Variations of Hebbian Learning  There have been a number of variations on the basic Hebb rule. In fact,  many of the learning laws that will be discussed in the remainder of this  text have some relationship to the Hebb rule.  One of the problems of the Hebb rule is that it can lead to weight matrices  having very large elements if there are many prototype patterns in the  training set. Consider again the basic rule:  A positive parameter  , called the learning rate, can be used to limit the  amount of increase in the weight matrix elements, if the learning rate is  less than one, as in:    Wnew Wold  =  +  T tqpq  .  Wnew Wold tqpq  +  =  T  .   7.43    7.44   We can also add a decay term, so that the learning rule behaves like a  smoothing filter, remembering the most recent inputs more clearly:  Wnew Wold tqpq  +  =  T  Wold  –  =  – 1  Wold tqpq  +  T  ,   7.45     where  learning law becomes the standard rule. As    is a positive constant less than one. As        approaches zero, the    approaches one, the learning   7-12   Variations of Hebbian Learning  law quickly forgets old inputs and remembers only the most recent pat- terns. This keeps the weight matrix from growing without bound.  The idea of filtering the weight changes and of having an adjustable learn- ing rate are important ones, and we will discuss them again in Chapters  10, 12, 15, 16, 18 and 19.  If we modify Eq.  7.44  by replacing the desired output with the difference  between the desired output and the actual output, we get another impor- tant learning rule:  Wnew Wold  tq  +  =    aq–  T pq  .   7.46   This is sometimes known as the delta rule, since it uses the difference be- tween desired and actual output. It is also known as the Widrow-Hoff algo- rithm, after the researchers who introduced it. The delta rule adjusts the  weights so as to minimize the mean square error  see Chapter 10 . For this  reason it will produce the same results as the pseudoinverse rule, which  minimizes the sum of squares of errors  see Eq.  7.25  . The advantage of  the delta rule is that it can update the weights after each new input pattern  is presented, whereas the pseudoinverse rule computes the weights in one  step, after all of the input target pairs are known. This sequential updating  allows the delta rule to adapt to a changing environment. The delta rule  will be discussed in detail in Chapter 10.   The basic Hebb rule will be discussed again, in a different context, in Chap- ter 13. In the present chapter we have used a supervised form of the Hebb  rule. We have assumed that the desired outputs of the network,  , are  known, and can be used in the learning rule. In the unsupervised Hebb  rule, which is discussed in Chapter 13, the actual network output is used  instead of the desired network output, as in:  tq  Wnew Wold aqpq  =  +  T  ,   7.47   aq   is the output of the network when    is given as the input  see  where  also Eq.  7.5  . This unsupervised form of the Hebb rule, which does not re- quire knowledge of the desired output, is actually a more direct interpreta- tion of Hebb’s postulate than is the supervised form discussed in this  chapter.  pq  7  7-13   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  Summary of Results  Hebb’s Postulate  “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or  persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change  takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells fir- ing B, is increased.”  Linear Associator  Inputs  p R x 1  R  n cid:0 W  Linear Layer  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a = purelin  Wp   S x R  S x 1  S  a S x 1  new  wij  =  old wij  +  tqipqj  T W t1p1  =  +  t2p2  T  tQpQ +  +  T  W  =  t1 t2  tQ  =  TPT  T p1 T p2  T pQ  W TP+  =  7-14  The Hebb Rule  Pseudoinverse Rule   Summary of Results  When the number,  Q be computed by  , of   P   and the columns of   P  R  , of rows of   P   is greater than the number of columns,   are independent, then the pseudoinverse can   P+  =  PTP   1– PT  .

This  did not cause the same problem with network performance that we saw in  Problem P7.1, because of the hardlims nonlinearity. It forces the network  output to be either 1 or -1.

Recall from Chapters 3 and 4 that the decision boundary for the percep- tron network is the line defined by:  7  If there is no bias, then   b  0=   and the boundary is defined by:  Wp b+  0=  .

Now consider the two  vectors,  ically in the figure to the left, along with an arbitrary decision boundary  that passes through the origin. It is clear that no decision boundary that  passes through the origin could separate these two vectors. Therefore a  bias is required to solve this problem.  ii. To use the pseudoinverse rule  or the Hebb rule  when there is a bias  term, we should treat the bias as another weight, with an input of 1  as is  shown in all of the network figures . We then augment the input vectors  with a 1 as the last element:  7-25   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  Let’s choose the desired outputs to be  so that  p'1  =  p'2  =  .  2 2 1  t1  1=  t2  1–=  ,  P  =  ,   T  =  1 1–  .  1 1 1  1 2 1 2 1 1  We now form the pseudoinverse matrix:  P+  =  1 1 1 2 2 1         1–      1 2 1 2 1 1  1–  1 1 1 2 2 1  =  3 5 5 9  1 1 1 2 2 1  =  0.5– 0.5– 0.5 0.5  2 1–  .

This boundary does separate the two prototype vectors.  7-26   Solved Problems  Wp + b = 0  p2  p1  Figure P7.4  Decision Boundary for Solved Problem P7.6  P7.7 In all of our pattern recognition examples thus far, we have repre- sented patterns as vectors by using “1” and “-1” to represent dark  and light pixels  picture elements , respectively. What if we were  to use “1” and “0” instead? How should the Hebb rule be changed?  First, let’s introduce some notation to distinguish the two different repre- sentations  usually referred to as the bipolar {-1, 1} representation and the  binary {0, 1} representation . The bipolar representation of the prototype  input output vectors will be denoted  p1 t1 { , }    { , }   pQ tQ p2 t2 }  {      ,  ,  and the binary representation will be denoted  {  p'1 t'1 , }    {  p'2 t'2  ,   }   p'Q t'Q  {    ,  }  .  The relationship between the two representations is given by:  p'q  =  1 ---pq 2  ---1+  1 2  pq  =  2p'q  1–  ,  where   1   is a vector of ones.  Next, we determine the form of the binary associative network. We will use  the network shown in Figure P7.5. It is different than the bipolar associa- tive network, as shown in Figure 7.2, in two ways. First, it uses the hardlim  nonlinearity rather than hardlims, since the output should be either 0 or  1. Secondly, it uses a bias vector. It requires a bias vector because all binary  vectors will fall into one quadrant of the vector space, so a boundary that  passes through the origin will not always be able to divide the patterns.   See Problem P7.6.   The next step is to determine the weight matrix and the bias vector for this  network. If we want the binary network of Figure P7.5 to have the same   7  7-27   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  effective response as a bipolar network  as in Figure 7.2 , then the net in- put,   , should be the same for both networks:  n  W'p' b+  =  Wp  .

If we then substitute for   p'   as a function of   p   we find:  W'     ---p 1 1  ---1+  2 2  b+  =  1 ---W'p 1 ---W'1 + 2 2  b+  =  Wp  .  Therefore, to produce the same results as the bipolar network, we should  choose  W'  2W=  b  –=  W1  ,  where   W   is the bipolar weight matrix.  7-28   Epilogue  Epilogue  We had two main objectives for this chapter. First, we wanted to introduce  one of the most influential neural network learning rules: the Hebb rule.  This was one of the first neural learning rules ever proposed, and yet it con- tinues to influence even the most recent developments in network learning  theory. Second, we wanted to show how the performance of this learning  rule could be explained using the linear algebra concepts discussed in the  two preceding chapters. This is one of the key objectives of this text. We  want to show how certain important mathematical concepts underlie the  operation of all artificial neural networks. We plan to continue to weave to- gether the mathematical ideas with the neural network applications, and  hope in the process to increase our understanding of both.  We will again revisit the Hebb rule in Chapters 15 and 21. In Chapter 21  we will use the Hebb rule in the design of a recurrent associative memory  network — the Hopfield network.  The next two chapters introduce some mathematics that are critical to our  understanding of the two learning laws covered in Chapters 10 and 11.  Those learning laws fall under a subheading called performance learning,  because they attempt to optimize the performance of the network. In order  to understand these performance learning laws, we need to introduce some  basic concepts in optimization. As with the material on the Hebb rule, our  understanding of these topics in optimization will be greatly aided by our  previous work in linear algebra.  7  7-29   7 Supervised Hebbian Learning  Further Reading  [Albe72]   A.

Add one digit at a time up to  “6”, and test how often the correct digit is reconstructed after randomly  changing 2, 4 and 6 pixels.  i. First use the Hebb rule to create the weight matrix for the digits “0”  and “1”. Then randomly change 2 pixels of each digit and apply the  noisy digits to the network. Repeat this process 10 times, and record  the percentage of times in which the correct pattern  without noise   is produced at the output of the network. Repeat as 4 and 6 pixels of  each digit are modified. The entire process is then repeated when  the digits “0”, “1” and “2” are used. This continues, one digit at a  time, until you test the network when all of the digits “0” through  “6” are used. When you have completed all of the tests, you will be  able to plot three curves showing percentage error versus number of  digits stored, one curve each for 2, 4 and 6 pixel errors.  ii.

There are several different classes of  network learning laws, including associative learning  as in the Hebbian  learning of Chapter 7  and competitive learning  which we will discuss in  Chapter 16 . Performance learning is another important class of learning  law, in which the network parameters are adjusted to optimize the perfor- mance of the network. In the next two chapters we will lay the groundwork  for the development of performance learning, which will then be presented  in detail in Chapters 10–14. The main objective of the present chapter is to  investigate performance surfaces and to determine conditions for the exist- ence of minima and maxima of the performance surface. Chapter 9 will fol- low this up with a discussion of procedures to locate the minima or maxima.  8-1   Theory and Examples  Performance Learning  Performance Index  8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  There are several different learning laws that fall under the category of  performance learning. Two of these will be presented in this text. These  learning laws are distinguished by the fact that during training the net- work parameters  weights and biases  are adjusted in an effort to optimize  the “performance” of the network.  There are two steps involved in this optimization process. The first step is  to define what we mean by “performance.” In other words, we must find a  quantitative measure of network performance, called the performance in- dex, which is small when the network performs well and large when the  network performs poorly. In this chapter, and in Chapter 9, we will assume  that the performance index is given. In Chapters 10, 11 and 13 we will dis- cuss the choice of performance index.  The second step of the optimization process is to search the parameter  space  adjust the network weights and biases  in order to reduce the per- formance index. In this chapter we will investigate the characteristics of  performance surfaces and set some conditions that will guarantee that a  surface does have a minimum point  the optimum we are searching for .  Thus, in this chapter we will obtain some understanding of what perfor- mance surfaces look like. Then, in Chapter 9 we will develop procedures for  locating the optimum points.  Taylor Series  Taylor Series Expansion  F x   Let us say that the performance index that we want to minimize is repre- sented by   is the scalar parameter we are adjusting. We will  assume that the performance index is an analytic function, so that all of its  derivatives exist. Then it can be represented by its Taylor series expansion  about some nominal point   , where   x  x  :  F x   =  F x    +  F x   x– x    x  x=  d xd  +  1 --- 2  2  d x2 d  F x   x  x=  x– x  2   +  +  1 ----- n!  n  d xn d  F x   x  x=  x– x  n   +   8.1   2 2+  We will use the Taylor series expansion to approximate the performance  index, by limiting the expansion to a finite number of terms. For example,  let   8-2   Taylor Series  F x   =  cos  x   .   8.2   The Taylor series expansion for   F x    about the point   x  0=   is  F x   =  cos  x   =  cos  0   –  sin  0  x  0–    –  cos  0  x  0–  2  1 --- 2  +  1 --- 6  sin  0  x  0–  3  +    =  1  –  1 ---x2 2  +  1 ------x4  24  +  The zeroth-order approximation of  is  F x     using only the zeroth power of   x      The second-order approximation is  F x  F0 x     1=  .  F x  F2 x     =  1  –  1 ---x2 2  .   Note that in this case the first-order approximation is the same as the ze- roth-order approximation, since the first derivative is zero.   The fourth-order approximation is   F x  F4 x     =  1  –  1 ---x2 2  +  1 ------x4 24  .  A graph showing  8.1.

However, as    moves farther away from   From the figure we can see that all three approximations are accurate if  is very close to  higher-order approximations are accurate. The second-order approxima- tion is accurate over a wider range than the zeroth-order approximation,  and the fourth-order approximation is accurate over a wider range than the  second-order approximation.

To experiment with Taylor series expansions of the cosine function, use the  MATLAB® Neural Network Design Demonstration Taylor Series  nnd8ts1 .  Vector Case Of course the neural network performance index will not be a function of a  scalar  . It will be a function of all of the network parameters  weights and  biases , of which there may be a very large number. Therefore, we need to  extend the Taylor series expansion to functions of many variables. Consid- er the following function of    variables:  x  n  F x   =   F x1 x2   xn          .   8.7   The Taylor series expansion for this function, about the point   x  , will be  F x   =  F x    +  F x    x1    x1  –  x1    +  x x=   x2  F x   x x=    x2  –  x2      +  +   xn  F x   x x=    xn  –  xn    +  1 --- 2  2   2  x1  F x   x x=    x1  –  x1  2  +  1 --- 2    2  x1 x2  F x   x x=    x1  –  x1   x2   –  x2    +  This notation is a bit cumbersome. It is more convenient to write it in ma- trix form, as in:  F x   =  F x    +    F x   T  x x–    x x= T F x   2  +  1 x– --- x 2  x– x    +    x x=   8.8    8.9   Gradient  where     F x    is the gradient, and is defined as  8-4   Directional Derivatives    F x   =  F x   F x    F x    x1   x2   xn  T  ,   8.10   Hessian  and   2  F x    is the Hessian, and is defined as:  2  F x   =    F x   F x    F x   .   8.11   F x   F x    F x     2  x1 x2 2   2  x2    2   2  x1 2  x2 x1  2  xn x1    F x   2  xn x2    F x    2  x1 xn 2  x2 xn        F x   2   2  xn  The gradient and the Hessian are very important to our understanding of  performance surfaces. In the next section we discuss the practical meaning  of these two concepts.

The ith element of the diagonal of the  formance index   along the  xi F 2F x  xi 2 Hessian matrix,  , is the second derivative of the performance in-  axis.

First we evaluate the gradient  at    in the direction   0.5 0.5  2 1–  p  =  :  T  T  = x    F x   =  x x=   x1  x2  F x   F x   =  2x1 4x2  =  .  1 2  x x=   8.15   The derivative in the direction    can then be computed:  p  x x=  1 2 1– 2 ------------------------  2 1–  pT F x  ----------------------   p  =  =  0 ------- 5  =  0  .   8.16   x Therefore the function has zero slope in the direction  Why did this happen? What can we say about those directions that have  zero slope? If we consider the definition of directional derivative in Eq.   8.12 , we can see that the numerator is an inner product between the di- rection vector and the gradient. Therefore any direction that is orthogonal  to the gradient will have zero slope.   from the point   p  .   Which direction has the greatest slope? The maximum slope will occur  when the inner product of the direction vector and the gradient is a maxi- mum. This happens when the direction vector is the same as the gradient.   Notice that the magnitude of the direction vector has no effect, since we  normalize by its magnitude.  This effect is illustrated in Figure 8.2, which  . On the contour plot we see five  shows a contour plot and a 3-D plot of  vectors starting from our nominal point   and pointing in different direc- tions. At the end of each vector the first directional derivative is displayed.  The maximum derivative occurs in the direction of the gradient. The zero  derivative is in the direction orthogonal to the gradient  tangent to the con- tour line .

Notice that it has two strong min- imum points: at approximately -1.1 and 1.1. For both of these points the  function increases in a local neighborhood. The minimum at 1.1 is a global  minimum, since there is no other point for which the function is as small.  There is no weak minimum for this function. We will show a two-dimen- sional example of a weak minimum later.

First, consider the following function:  Contour Plot  Saddle Point  F x   =    x2  x1–  4  +  8x1x2  x1–  +  x2  +  3  .   8.18   In Figure 8.4 we have a contour plot  a series of curves along which the  function value remains constant  and a 3-D surface plot for this function   for function values less than 12 . We can see that the function has two  strong local minimum points: one at  -0.42, 0.42 , and the other at  0.55,  -0.55 . The global minimum point is at  0.55, -0.55 .  There is also another interesting feature of this function at  -0.13, 0.13 . It  is called a saddle point because of the shape of the surface in the neighbor- hood of the point. It is characterized by the fact that along the line    x2–= the saddle point is a local maximum, but along a line orthogonal to that line  it is a local minimum. We will investigate this example in more detail in  Problems P8.2 and P8.5.  x1   Necessary Conditions for Optimality  This function is used in the MATLAB® Neural Network Design Demonstra- tion Vector Taylor Series  nnd8ts2 .  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  12  8  4  0 2  8  6  4  2  0 2  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure 8.4  Vector Example of Minima and Saddle Point  2 2+  As a final example, consider the function defined in Eq.  8.19 :  F x   =    2 x1  –  1.5x1x2  +  2 2x2  2 x1   8.19   The contour and 3-D plots of this function are given in Figure 8.5.

Therefore,  since Eq.  8.23  must be true, and Eq.  8.24  must be false, the only alter- native must be that  x  Since this must be true for any   x  , we have    F x   T  x  0=  .  x x=    F x   0=  .  x x=   8.20    8.21    8.22    8.23    8.24    8.26    8.27   Stationary Points  Therefore the gradient must be zero at a minimum point.

We can check these conditions by testing the eigenvalues  of the matrix. If all eigenvalues are positive, then the matrix is positive def- inite. If all eigenvalues are nonnegative, then the matrix is positive  semidefinite.   A positive definite Hessian matrix is a second-order, sufficient condition for  a strong minimum to exist. It is not a necessary condition. A minimum can  still be strong if the second-order term of the Taylor series is zero, but the  third-order term is positive. Therefore the second-order, necessary condi- tion for a strong minimum is that the Hessian matrix be positive semi-def- inite.  8  2 2+  To illustrate these conditions, consider the following function of two vari- ables:  First, we want to locate any stationary points, so we need to evaluate the  gradient:   8.29    8.30    8.31    8.32    8.33   F x   =  4 x1  2+ x2  .    F x   =  =  0  .  3 4x1 2x2  8-11   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  Therefore the only stationary point is the point  test the second-order condition, which requires the Hessian matrix:  . We now need to   0=  x  2  F x   =  x  0=  12x1  2 0 2  0  x  0=  =  0 0 0 2  .   8.34   0=  This matrix is positive semidefinite, which is a necessary condition for  x  to be a strong minimum point. We cannot guarantee from first-or- der and second-order conditions that it is a minimum point, but we have  not eliminated it as a possibility. Actually, even though the Hessian matrix  is only positive semidefinite,  cannot prove it from the conditions we have discussed.   is a strong minimum point, but we   0=  x  Just to summarize, the necessary conditions for  strong or weak, of    are:  F x   x   to be a minimum,     F x   0=   and   2  F x    positive semidefinite.  x x=  x x=  The sufficient conditions for    to be a strong minimum point of   F x    are:  x    F x   0=   and   2  F x    positive definite.  x x=  x x=  Quadratic Functions  We will find throughout this text that one type of performance index is uni- versal — the quadratic function. This is true because there are many appli- cations in which the quadratic function appears, but also because many  functions can be approximated by quadratic functions in small neighbor- hoods, especially near local minimum points. For this reason we want to  spend a little time investigating the characteristics of the quadratic func- tion.  Quadratic Function  The general form of a quadratic function is  F x   =  1 ---xTAx dTx 2  +  +  c  ,   8.35   where the matrix  replaced by a symmetric matrix that produces the same    is symmetric.  If the matrix is not symmetric it can be   . Try it!   A  F x   To find the gradient for this function, we will use the following useful prop- erties of the gradient:      hTx    =  xTh     =  h  ,   8.36   where   h   is a constant vector, and  8-12   Quadratic Functions    xTQx  =  Qx QTx  +  =  2Qx   for symmetric Q   .   8.37   We can now compute the gradient of   F x   :  and in a similar way we can find the Hessian:    F x   =  Ax d+  ,  2  F x   A=  .  All higher derivatives of the quadratic function are zero. Therefore the first  three terms of the Taylor series expansion  as in Eq.  8.20   give an exact  representation of the function. We can also say that all analytic functions  behave like quadratics over a small neighborhood  i.e., when   is small .  x  Eigensystem of the Hessian We now want to investigate the general shape of the quadratic function. It  turns out that we can tell a lot about the shape by looking at the eigenval- ues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. Consider a quadratic function  that has a stationary point at the origin, and whose value there is zero:  The shape of this function can be seen more clearly if we perform a change  of basis  see Chapter 6 . We want to use the eigenvectors of the Hessian  matrix,   is symmetric, its eigenvectors  will be mutually orthogonal.  See [Brog91].  This means that if we make up  a matrix with the eigenvectors as the columns, as in Eq.  6.68 :  , as the new basis vectors. Since   A  A  F x   =  1 ---xTAx 2  .  B  =  z1 z2  zn  ,  B 1–  =  BT  .  the inverse of the matrix will be the same as the transpose:  8   This assumes that we have normalized the eigenvectors.   If we now perform a change of basis, so that the eigenvectors are the basis  vectors  as in Eq.  6.69  , the new    matrix will be  A   8.38    8.39    8.40    8.41    8.42    8.43   A'  =    BTAB    =  1 0  0 0 2  0    0 0  n  =    ,  8-13   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  where the   i   are the eigenvalues of   . We can also write this equation as  A  A  =  BBT  .   8.44   We will now use the concept of the directional derivative to explain the  physical meaning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of  how they determine the shape of the surface of the quadratic function.  , and to explain   A  Recall from Eq.  8.13  that the second derivative of a function  direction of a vector    is given by  p  F x    in the   Now define   2  pT F x  p ----------------------------  =  p 2  pTAp -------------- p 2  .  p  =  Bc  ,  where  tors of  tion, and Eq.  8.44 , we can rewrite Eq.  8.45 :  c  is the representation of the vector   with respect to the eigenvec- A .  See Eq.  6.28  and the discussion that follows.  With this defini-  p  pTAp -------------- p 2  =  cTBT BBT Bc  ---------------------------------------- cTBTBc  =  cTc ------------ cTc  =  n  2  ici 1= i ------------------- n 2  ci  i  1=  .  This result tells us several useful things. First, note that this second deriv- ative is just a weighted average of the eigenvalues. Therefore it can never  be larger than the largest eigenvalue, or smaller than the smallest eigen- value. In other words,  min    pTAp -------------- max p 2    .  p  =  zmax  ,  Under what condition, if any, will this second derivative be equal to the  largest eigenvalue? What if we choose  where  For this case the   zmax  c   vector will be   is the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue,   c  =  BTp  =  BTzmax  =  0 0  0 1 0  0  T  ,   8.45    8.46    8.47    8.48    8.49   max  ?    8.50   8-14   z2  λmax    z1  λmin   Quadratic Functions  where the one occurs only in the position that corresponds to the largest  eigenvalue  i.e.,   . This is because the eigenvectors are orthonor- mal.  cmax  1=  If we now substitute   zmax   for   p   in Eq.  8.47  we obtain  TAzmax zmax ---------------------------- zmax  2  =  n  2  ici 1= i ------------------- n 2  ci  i  1=  =  max  .   8.51   So the maximum second derivative occurs in the direction of the eigenvec- tor that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. In fact, in each of the eigen- vector directions the second derivatives will be equal to the corresponding  eigenvalue. In other directions the second derivative will be a weighted av- erage of the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are the second derivatives in the  directions of the eigenvectors.  The eigenvectors define a new coordinate system in which the quadratic  cross terms vanish. The eigenvectors are known as the principal axes of the  function contours. The figure to the left illustrates these concepts in two di- mensions. This figure illustrates the case where the first eigenvalue is  smaller than the second eigenvalue. Therefore the minimum curvature   second derivative  will occur in the direction of the first eigenvector. This  means that we will cross contour lines more slowly in this direction. The  maximum curvature will occur in the direction of the second eigenvector,  therefore we will cross contour lines more quickly in that direction.   One caveat about this figure: it is only valid when both eigenvalues have  the same sign, so that we have either a strong minimum or a strong maxi- mum. For these cases the contour lines are always elliptical. We will pro- vide examples later where the eigenvalues have opposite signs and where  one of the eigenvalues is zero.  8  2 2+  For our first example, consider the following function:  F x   =  2 x1  2+ x2  =  1 ---xT 2 0 2 0 2  x  .   8.52   The Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are  2  F x   =  ,   1  2=  ,   z1  =  ,   2  2=  ,   z2  =   8.53   1 0  .  0 1  2 0 0 2  8-15   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points   Actually, any two independent vectors could be the eigenvectors in this  case. There is a repeated eigenvalue, and its eigenvector is the plane.   Since all the eigenvalues are equal, the curvature should be the same in all  directions, and therefore the function should have circular contours. Figure  8.6 shows the contour and 3-D plots for this function, a circular hollow.  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  4  2  0 2  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure 8.6  Circular Hollow  2 2+  Let’s try an example with distinct eigenvalues. Consider the following qua- dratic function:  F x   =  2 x1  +  x1x2  +  2 x2  =  1 ---xT 2 1 2 1 2  x   8.54   The Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are  2  F x   =  ,   1  1=  ,   z1  =  ,   2  3=  ,   z2  =   8.55   2 1 1 2  1 1–  .  1 1   As we discussed in Chapter 6, the eigenvectors are not unique, they can be  multiplied by any scalar.  In this case the maximum curvature is in the di- rection of   so we should cross contour lines more quickly in that direction.  Figure 8.7 shows the contour and 3-D plots for this function, an elliptical  hollow.  z2  8-16   Quadratic Functions  3  2  1  0 2  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure 8.7  Elliptical Hollow  2 2+  What happens when the eigenvalues have opposite signs? Consider the fol- lowing function:  F x   =  –  1 2 ---x1 4  –  3 ---x1x2 2  –  1 2 ---x2 4  =  1 ---xT 2  0.5– 1.5–  1.5– 0.5–  x  .   8.56   The Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are  2  F x   =  0.5– 1.5–  1.5– 0.5–  1– 1  ,   1  1=  ,   z1  =  ,   2  2–=  ,   z2  =  .   8.57   1– 1–  z1  The first eigenvalue is positive, so there is positive curvature in the direc- tion of  . The second eigenvalue is negative, so there is negative curvature  in the direction of  . Also, since the magnitude of the second eigenvalue is  greater than the magnitude of the first eigenvalue, we will cross contour  lines faster in the direction of   z2  .  z2  Figure 8.8 shows the contour and 3-D plots for this function, an elongated  saddle. Note that the stationary point,  8  x  =  ,  0 0   8.58   is no longer a strong minimum point, since the Hessian matrix is not posi- tive definite. Since the eigenvalues are of opposite sign, we know that the  Hessian is indefinite  see [Brog91] . The stationary point is therefore a sad- dle point. It is a minimum of the function along the first eigenvector  posi- tive eigenvalue , but it is a maximum of the function along the second  eigenvector  negative eigenvalue .  8-17   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  4  0  -4  -8 2  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure 8.8  Elongated Saddle  2 2+  As a final example, let’s try a case where one of the eigenvalues is zero. An  example of this is given by the following function:  F x   =  –  x1x2  +  1 2 ---x1 2  1 2 ---x2 2  =  1 ---xT 1 2 1–  1– 1  x  .   8.59   The Hessian matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are  2  F x   =  ,   1  2=  ,   z1  =  ,   2  0=  ,   z2  =   8.60   1 1–  1– 1  1– 1  .  1– 1–  The second eigenvalue is zero, so we would expect to have zero curvature  along  . Figure 8.9 shows the contour and 3-D plots for this function, a sta- tionary valley. In this case the Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite, and  we have a weak minimum along the line  z2  x1  x2=  ,   8.61   corresponding to the second eigenvector.  For quadratic functions the Hessian matrix must be positive definite in or- der for a strong minimum to exist. For higher-order functions it is possible  to have a strong minimum with a positive semidefinite Hessian matrix, as  we discussed previously in the section on minima.  8-18   Quadratic Functions  3  2  1  0 2  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure 8.9  Stationary Valley  To experiment with other quadratic functions, use the MATLAB® Neural  Network Design Demonstration Quadratic Function  nnd8qf .  At this point we can summarize some characteristics of the quadratic func- tion.   If the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix are all positive, the function  will have a single strong minimum.  If the eigenvalues are all negative, the function will have a single  strong maximum.  If some eigenvalues are positive and other eigenvalues are negative,  the function will have a single saddle point.  If the eigenvalues are all nonnegative, but some eigenvalues are zero,  then the function will either have a weak minimum  as in Figure 8.9   or will have no stationary point  see Solved Problem P8.7 .  If the eigenvalues are all nonpositive, but some eigenvalues are zero,  then the function will either have a weak maximum or will have no sta- tionary point.  8  We should note that in this discussion we have assumed, for simplicity,  that the stationary point of the quadratic function was at the origin, and  that it had a zero value there. This requires that the terms   in Eq.   8.35  both be zero. If   is nonzero then the function is simply increased in   at every point.

This result is illustrated in Figure P8.5.  2  1  0  -1  -2 -2  12  8  4  0 2  8-26  1  0  -1  0  -1  -2  -2  2  1  -1  0  1  2  Figure P8.5  Plot of   F x    for Problem P8.3   Solved Problems  P8.4 Consider the following fourth-order polynomial:  F x   =  x4  –  2x2  –  +  2x  +  4  .  2 ---x3 3  Find any stationary points and test them to see if they are minima.  To find the stationary points we set the derivative of   F x    to zero:  F x   =  4x3  2x2  –  4x–  2+  =  0  .  d xd  We can use MATLAB to find the roots of this polynomial:  coef=[4 -2 -4 2];  stapoints=roots coef ;  stapoints’  ans =  1.0000   -1.0000    0.5000  Now we need to check the second derivative at each of these points. The sec- ond derivative of   F x    is  2  d x2 d  F x   =  12x2  4x–  4–  .  If we evaluate this at each of the stationary points we find      2  d x2 d  F 1     4=         2  d x2 d  F 1–      12=         2  d x2 d  F 0.5      3–=   .  Therefore we should have strong local minima at 1 and -1  since the second  derivatives were positive , and a strong local maximum at 0.5  since the  second derivative was negative . To find the global minimum we would  have to evaluate the function at the two local minima:    F 1   =  4.333   F 1–       =  1.667    .  Therefore the global minimum occurs at -1. But are we sure that this is a  global minimum? What happens to the function as  ? In  this case, because the highest power of   has a positive coefficient and is  x  , the function goes to  an even power    at both limits. So we can safely   say that the global minimum occurs at -1. The function is plotted in Figure  P8.6.  –     or   x4  x  x  8  8-27   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  F x     =  x4  –  2x2  –  +  2x  +  4  2 ---x3 3  8  6  4  2  0 -2  -1  0  1  2  Figure P8.6  Graph of   F x    for Problem P8.4  P8.5 Look back to the function of Problem P8.2. This function has three   stationary points:  x1  =  – 0.41878 0.41878  ,   x2  =  – 0.134797 0.134797  ,   x3  =  0.55358 – 0.55358  .  Test whether or not any of these points could be local minima.  From Problem P8.2 we know that the Hessian matrix for the function is  2  F x   =    12 x2 12 x2    2 x1– 2 x1–  –  8+  –    12 x2  12 x2  x1– x1–  2 8+ 2  .  To test the definiteness of this matrix we can check the eigenvalues. If the  eigenvalues are all positive, the Hessian is positive definite, which guaran- tees a strong minimum. If the eigenvalues are nonnegative, the Hessian is  positive semidefinite, which is consistent with either a strong or a weak  minimum. If one eigenvalue is positive and the other eigenvalue is nega- tive, the Hessian is indefinite, which would signal a saddle point.  If we evaluate the Hessian at   x1  , we find  2  F x1    =  8.42 0.42 –  0.42 – 8.42  .  The eigenvalues of this matrix are  therefore   x1   must be a strong minimum point.  1  =  8.84  ,   2  =  8.0  ,  8-28   Solved Problems  If we evaluate the Hessian at   x2  , we find  The eigenvalues of this matrix are  2  F x2    =  0.87 7.13 7.13 0.87  .  1  –=  6.26  ,   2  =  8.0  ,  x2  therefore   must be a saddle point. In one direction the curvature is neg- ative, and in another direction the curvature is positive. The negative cur- vature is in the direction of the first eigenvector, and the positive curvature  is in the direction of the second eigenvector. The eigenvectors are  z1  =   and   z2  =  1 1–  .  1 1   Note that this is consistent with our previous discussion of this function  on page 8-8.   If we evaluate the Hessian at   x3  , we find  2  F x3    =  14.7 6.71 –  6.71 – 14.7  .  The eigenvalues of this matrix are  1  =  21.42  ,   2  =  8.0  ,  therefore   x3   must be a strong minimum point.

Consider the linear network shown in Figure P8.7. Suppose  that the desired inputs outputs for the network are      p1  2=      0.5= t1            p2  1–=      0= t2      .

First we will show that the  performance index is a quadratic function. Then we will find the eigenvec- tors and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix and use them to sketch the con- tour plot of the function.  F x   Begin by writing   F x    as an explicit function of the parameter vector   x  :  x  =  .  w b  F x   =  2 e1  2+ e2  ,    e1  =  t1  –    wp1  b+          e2  =  t2  –    wp2  b+      .  This can be written in matrix form:  where  where  F x   =  eTe  ,  e  =  t  –  x  =  t Gx –  .  p1 1 p2 1  The performance index can now be rewritten:  F x   =  t Gx –  T t Gx  –    =  tTt  –  2tTGx  +  xTGTGx  .  8-30   Solved Problems  If we compare this with Eq.  8.35 :  F x   =  1 ---xTAx dTx 2  +  +  c  ,  we can see that the performance index for this linear network is a quadrat- ic function, with  c  =  tTt  ,   d  =  2– GTt  , and   A  =  2GTG  .  The gradient of the quadratic function is given in Eq.  8.38 :    F x   =  Ax d+  =  2GTGx 2– GTt  .  The stationary point  also the center of the function contours  will occur  where the gradient is equal to zero:  x  =  A 1– d  –  =  GTG   1– GTt  .  G  =  p1 1 p2 1  =  2 1 1– 1   and   t  =  0.5 0  For   we have  x  =  GTG   1– GTt  =  1–  5 1 1 2  1 0.5  =  0.167 0.167  .   Therefore the optimal network parameters are   w  =  0.167   and   b  =  0.167  .    The Hessian matrix of the quadratic function is given by Eq.  8.39 :  8  2  F x   =  A  =  2GTG  =  10 2 2 4  .  To sketch the contour plot we need the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the  Hessian. For this case we find        1  =  10.6      z1  =  ,     2  3.4=     z2  =  1 0.3                  0.3 1–          .  Therefore we know that   is a strong minimum. Also, since the first eigen- value is larger than the second, we know that the contours will be elliptical  and that the long axis of the ellipses will be in the direction of the second       x  8-31   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  eigenvector.

This problem illustrates one such case. Consider the following  function:  F x   =  1 1– x  +  1 ---xT 1 1 2 1 1  x  .  Sketch the contour plot of this function.  As with Problem P8.6, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of  the Hessian matrix. By inspection of the quadratic function we see that the  Hessian matrix is  2  F x   =  A  =  1 1 1 1  .   8.63   The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are        1  0=     z1  =  ,     2  2=      z2  =      1 1–                          .  1 1  Notice that the first eigenvalue is zero, so there is no curvature along the  first eigenvector. The second eigenvalue is positive, so there is positive cur- vature along the second eigenvector. If we had no linear term in  , the  plot of the function would show a stationary valley, as in Figure 8.9. In this  case we must find out if the linear term creates a slope in the direction of  the valley  the direction of the first eigenvector .  F x   8-32   Solved Problems  The linear term is  From Eq.  8.36  we know that the gradient of this term is  Flin x   =  1 1– x  .    Flin x   =  ,  1 1–  which means that the linear term is increasing most rapidly in the direc- tion of this gradient. Since the quadratic term has no curvature in this di- rection, the overall function will have a linear slope in this direction.  Therefore   will have positive curvature in the direction of the second  eigenvector and a linear slope in the direction of the first eigenvector. The  contour plot and the 3-D plot for this function are given in Figure P8.9.

This lack of an inverse  could mean that we have a weak minimum point, as illustrated in Figure  8.9, or that there is no stationary point, as this example shows.  8-33   8 Performance Surfaces and Optimum Points  Epilogue  Performance learning is one of the most important classes of neural net- work learning rules. With performance learning, network parameters are  adjusted to optimize network performance. In this chapter we have intro- duced tools that we will need to understand performance learning rules. Af- ter reading this chapter and solving the exercises, you should be able to:  i. Perform a Taylor series expansion and use it to approximate a func-  tion.  ii. Calculate a directional derivative.  iii. Find stationary points and test whether they could be minima.  iv. Sketch contour plots of quadratic functions.  We will be using these concepts in a number of succeeding chapters, includ- ing the chapters on performance learning  9–14 , the radial basis network  chapter  17  and the chapters on stability and Hopfield networks  20–21 .  In the next chapter we will build on the concepts we have covered here, to  design algorithms that will optimize performance functions. Then, in suc- ceeding chapters, we will apply these algorithms to the training of neural  networks.  8-34   Further Reading  Further Reading  [Brog91]   W. L.

There we introduced the Taylor series expansion as a tool for analyzing the  performance surface, and then used it to determine conditions that must be  satisfied by optimum points. In this chapter we will again use the Taylor  series expansion, in this case to develop algorithms to locate the optimum  points. We will discuss three different categories of optimization algorithm:  steepest descent, Newton’s method and conjugate gradient. In Chapters  10–14 we will apply all of these algorithms to the training of neural net- works.  9  9-1   9 Performance Optimization  Theory and Examples  In the previous chapter we began our investigation of performance surfac- es. Now we are in a position to develop algorithms to search the parameter  space and locate minimum points of the surface  find the optimum weights  and biases for a given neural network .  It is interesting to note that most of the algorithms presented in this chap- ter were developed hundreds of years ago. The basic principles of optimiza- tion were discovered during the 17th century, by such scientists and  mathematicians as Kepler, Fermat, Newton and Leibniz. From 1950 on,  these principles were rediscovered to be implemented on “high speed”  in  comparison to the pen and paper available to Newton  digital computers.  The success of these efforts stimulated significant research on new algo- rithms, and the field of optimization theory became recognized as a major  branch of mathematics. Now neural network researchers have access to a  vast storehouse of optimization theory and practice that can be applied to  the training of neural networks.  The objective of this chapter, then, is to develop algorithms to optimize a  performance index  . For our purposes the word “optimize” will mean  . All of the optimization algo- to find the value of  x0 rithms we will discuss are iterative. We begin from some initial guess,  and then update our guess in stages according to an equation of the form   that minimizes   F x  x  F x   ,   or  xk  1+  =  xk kpk  +  ,  x k  =    xk  1+  xk–    =  kpk  ,   9.1    9.2   pk   represents a search direction, and the positive scalar    is the learning rate, which determines the length of the step.  where the vector  k The algorithms we will discuss in this chapter are distinguished by the  choice of the search direction,  ties. There are also a variety of ways to select the learning rate,  will discuss several of these.  . We will discuss three different possibili- , and we   k  pk  Steepest Descent  When we update our guess of the optimum  minimum  point using Eq.   9.1 , we would like to have the function decrease at each iteration.

Tpk gk  pk  =  g– k  .  xk  1+  =  xk kgk  –  .  xk kgk  –  .  9-3  Descent Direction  pk   that satisfies this equation is called a descent direction. The  Any vector  function must go down if we take a small enough step in this direction. This  brings up another question. What is the direction of steepest descent?  In  what direction will the function decrease most rapidly?  This will occur  when  is most negative.  We assume that the length of   does not change, only  the direction.  This is an inner product between the gradient and the direc- tion vector. It will be most negative when the direction vector is the nega- tive of the gradient.  Review our discussion of directional derivatives on  page 8-6.  Therefore a vector that points in the steepest descent direction is  pk  Steepest Descent  Using this in the iteration of Eq.  9.1  produces the method of steepest de- scent:  9  Learning Rate  For steepest descent there are two general methods for determining the  F x  learning rate,    k with respect to   at each iteration. In this case we are minimizing along  the line  .

The first iteration of   x1  =  x0 g0  –  =  0.5 0.5  –  0.01 1 25  =  0.49 0.25  .  The second iteration of steepest descent produces  x2  =  x1 g1  –  =  0.49 0.25  –  0.01 0.98 12.5  =  0.4802 0.125  .  If we continue the iterations we obtain the trajectory illustrated in Figure  9.1.   9.12    9.13    9.14    9.15    9.16    9.17   9-4   Steepest Descent  0.5  1  0  -0.5  -1 -1  0.5  1  0  -0.5  -1 -1  9-5  -0.5  0  0.5  1  Figure 9.1  Trajectory for Steepest Descent with     =  0.01  Note that the steepest descent trajectory, for small learning rate, follows a  path that is always orthogonal to the contour lines. This is because the gra- dient is orthogonal to the contour lines.  See the discussion on page 8-6.   How would a change in the learning rate change the performance of the al- gorithm? If we increase the learning rate to  , we obtain the tra- jectory illustrated in Figure 9.2. Note that the trajectory now oscillates. If  we make the learning rate too large the algorithm will become unstable;  the oscillations will increase instead of decaying.  0.035    =  -0.5  0  0.5  1  Figure 9.2  Trajectory for Steepest Descent with     =  0.035  We would like to make the learning rate large, since then we will be taking  large steps and would expect to converge faster. However, as we can see  from this example, if we make the learning rate too large the algorithm will  become unstable. Is there some way to predict the maximum allowable  learning rate? This is not possible for arbitrary functions, but for quadratic  functions we can set an upper limit.  9   9 Performance Optimization  Stable Learning Rates Suppose that the performance index is a quadratic function:  From Eq.  8.38  the gradient of the quadratic function is  F x   =  1 ---xTAx dTx 2  +  +  c  .    F x   =  Ax d+  .  If we now insert this expression into our expression for the steepest descent  algorithm  assuming a constant learning rate , we obtain  or  xk  1+  =  xk gk  –  =  xk  Axk d+  –      xk  1+  =  I A–  xk d–  .  I A–  This is a linear dynamic system, which will be stable if the eigenvalues of  the matrix   are less than one in magnitude  see [Brog91] . We can  express the eigenvalues of this matrix in terms of the eigenvalues of the  Hessian matrix   ues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix. Then   be the eigenval-  1 2   n  z1 z2   zn  .

Eq.  9.23  then reduces to  Since this must be true for all the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix we  have  The maximum stable learning rate is inversely proportional to the maxi- mum curvature of the quadratic function. The curvature tells us how fast  the gradient is changing.

This will cause the steps to increase in size at each iteration.  2 2+  Let’s apply this result to our previous example. The Hessian matrix for that  quadratic function is  A  =  2 0 0 50  .  The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of   A   are        1  2=      z1  =    2  50=      z2  =                   1 0              .  0 1  Therefore the maximum allowable learning rate is      2 ----------- max  =  2 ------ 50  =  0.04  .   9.26    9.27    9.28   This result is illustrated experimentally in Figure 9.3, which shows the  steepest descent trajectories when the learning rate is just below       , the maximum stable value.    and just above    0.041  0.039    =  =  0.5  1  0  -0.5  -1 -1  0.5  1  0  -0.5  -1 -1  -0.5  0  0.5  1  -0.5  0  0.5  1  Figure 9.3  Trajectories for     =  0.039    left  and     =  0.041    right .  This example has illustrated several points. The learning rate is limited by  the largest eigenvalue  second derivative  of the Hessian matrix. The algo- rithm tends to converge most quickly in the direction of the eigenvector cor- responding to this largest eigenvalue, and we don’t want to overshoot the  minimum point by too far in that direction.  Note that in our examples the  initial step is almost parallel to the  .  However, the al- gorithm will tend to converge most slowly in the direction of the eigenvec-   axis, which is   z2  x2  9  9-7   9 Performance Optimization  tor that corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue   end it is the smallest eigenvalue, in combination with the learning rate,  that determines how quickly the algorithm will converge. When there is a  great difference in magnitude between the largest and smallest eigenval- ues, the steepest descent algorithm will converge slowly.   for our example . In the   z1  To experiment with steepest descent on this quadratic function, use the Neu- ral Network Design Demonstration Steepest Descent for a Quadratic   nnd9sdq .  Minimizing Along a Line Another approach for selecting the learning rate is to minimize the perfor- mance index with respect to    k to minimize   at each iteration. In other words, choose   k  F xk kpk   +    .   9.29   To do this for arbitrary functions requires a line search, which we will dis- cuss in Chapter 12. For quadratic functions it is possible to perform the lin- ear minimization analytically. The derivative of Eq.  9.29  with respect to  k  , can be shown to be  , for quadratic   F x   d kd  F xk kpk   +    =    F x   T  pk kpk  +  T F x  2  x xk=  pk  .  x xk=   9.30   If we set this derivative equal to zero and solve for   k  , we obtain  k  =  –     T  F x  pk  --------------------------------------------- T F x  pk pk 2  x xk=  x xk=  =  –     Tpk gk ------------------ TAkpk pk  ,  where   Ak   is the Hessian matrix evaluated at the old guess   xk  :   For quadratic functions the Hessian matrix is not a function of   k  .   2 2+  Let’s apply steepest descent with line minimization to the following qua- dratic function:  Ak    2  F x   .  x xk=  F x   =  1 ---xT 2 1 2 1 2  x  ,   9.31    9.32    9.33   starting from the initial guess  9-8    9.34    9.35    9.36   Steepest Descent  The gradient of this function is  x0  =  0.8 0.25  –  .    F x   =  2x1 x2+ + 2x2 x1  .  The search direction for steepest descent is the negative of the gradient.  For the first iteration this will be  p0  =  g– 0  =  –  F x   =  x x0=  1.35 – 0.3–  .  From Eq.  9.31 , the learning rate for the first iteration will be  0  =  –  1.35 0.3  – 1.35 0.3–  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1.35 – 0.3–  2 1 1 2  0.3–  1.35  –  =  0.413  .   9.37   The first step of steepest descent will then produce  x1  =  x0 0g0  –  =  0.8 0.25  –  –  0.413 1.35 0.3  =  0.24 0.37 –  .   9.38   The first five iterations of the algorithm are illustrated in Figure 9.4.  Note that the successive steps of the algorithm are orthogonal. Why does  this happen? First, when we minimize along a line we will always stop at  a point that is tangent to a contour line. Then, since the gradient is orthog- onal to the contour line, the next step, which is along the negative of the  gradient, will be orthogonal to the previous step.   We can show this analytically by using the chain rule on Eq.  9.30 :  9  d kd  F xk kpk   +    =  F xk   1+    =    F x   T  d kd  x xk  =  1+  d kd    xk kpk  +     9.39   =    F x   T  pk  =  T pk . gk  1+  x xk  =  1+  9-9   9 Performance Optimization  Therefore at the minimum point, where this derivative is zero, the gradient  is orthogonal to the previous search direction. Since the next search direc- tion is the negative of this gradient, the consecutive search directions must  be orthogonal.  Note that this result implies that when minimizing in any  direction, the gradient at the minimum point will be orthogonal to the  search direction, even if we are not using steepest descent. We will use this  result in our discussion of conjugate directions.

Later in this chapter we will find that we can improve performance if we  adjust the search directions, so that instead of being orthogonal they are  conjugate.  We will define this term later.  If conjugate directions are used  the function can be exactly minimized in at most   is the  dimension of  .  There are certain types of quadratic functions that are  minimized in one step by the steepest descent algorithm. Can you think of  such a function? How is its Hessian matrix characterized?    steps, where   x  n  n  Newton’s Method  The derivation of the steepest descent algorithm was based on the first-or- der Taylor series expansion  Eq.  9.4  . Newton’s method is based on the  second-order Taylor series:  F xk   1+    =  F xk xk   +   F xk     +  Txk gk  +  1 ---xk 2  TAkxk  .   9.40   The principle behind Newton’s method is to locate the stationary point of  . If we use Eq.  8.38  to take the gra- this quadratic approximation to  dient of this quadratic function with respect to   and set it equal to zero,  we find  F x   xk    9.41    9.42    9.43    9.44    9.45    9.46    9.47   Newton’s Method  Solving for   xk   produces  Newton’s Method  Newton’s method is then defined:  gk Akxk  +  0=  .  xk  =  1–– Ak  gk  .  xk  1+  =  xk Ak  –  1– gk  .  F x   =  2 x1  +  2 25x2  .  2 2+  To illustrate the operation of Newton’s method, let’s apply it to our previous  example function of Eq.  9.12 :  The gradient and Hessian matrices are    F x   =   x1  x2  F x   F x   =  2x1 50x2  ,   2  F x   =  2 0 0 50  .  If we start from the same initial guess  x0  =  ,  0.5 0.5  the first step of Newton’s method would be  1–  x1  =  0.5 0.5  –  2 0 0 50  1 25  =  0.5 0.5  –  0.5 0.5  =  .  0 0  This method will always find the minimum of a quadratic function in one  step. This is because Newton’s method is designed to approximate a func- tion as quadratic and then locate the stationary point of the quadratic ap- proximation. If the original function is quadratic  with a strong minimum   it will be minimized in one step. The trajectory of Newton’s method for this  problem is given in Figure 9.5.  If the function   is not quadratic, then Newton’s method will not gener- ally converge in one step. In fact, we cannot be sure that it will converge at  all, since this will depend on the function and the initial guess.

On the right we see the quadratic approximation to the function  at the initial guess.  , our first iteration will be as shown in Figure 9.6. The   The function is not minimized in one step, which is not surprising since the  function is not quadratic. However, we do take a step toward the global  minimum, and if we continue for two more iterations the algorithm will  converge to within 0.01 of the global minimum. Newton’s method converges  quickly in many applications because analytic functions can be accurately  approximated by quadratic functions in a small neighborhood of a strong  minimum. So as we move closer to the minimum point, Newton’s method  will more accurately predict its location. In this case we can see that the  contour plot of the quadratic approximation is similar to the contour plot of  the original function near the initial guess.

In this case we are converging to the local minimum. Clear- ly Newton’s method cannot distinguish between a local minimum and a glo- bal minimum, since it approximates the function as a quadratic, and the  quadratic function can have only one minimum. Newton’s method, like  steepest descent, relies on the local features of the surface  the first and  second derivatives . It cannot know the global character of the function.  -1  0  1  2  -1  0  1  2  Figure 9.7  One Iteration of Newton’s Method from   x0  =  1.5–  0  T  T  =  0.75 0.75  In Figure 9.8 we see one iteration of Newton’s method from the initial guess  x0 . Now we are converging toward the saddle point of the  function. Note that Newton’s method locates the stationary point of the  quadratic approximation to the function at the current guess. It does not  distinguish between minima, maxima and saddle points. For this problem  the quadratic approximation has a saddle point  indefinite Hessian ma-  9  9-13   9 Performance Optimization  trix , which is near the saddle point of the original function.

This is not always the case. In fact, Newton’s method can produce   T  =  1.15 0.75  In Figure 9.9 we see one iteration of Newton’s method from the initial guess  x0 . In this case the quadratic approximation predicts a sad- dle point, however, the saddle point is located very close to the local mini- mum of  .

This is a good place to summarize some of the properties of Newton’s meth- od that we have observed.   While Newton’s method usually produces faster convergence than steepest  descent, the behavior of Newton’s method can be quite complex. In addition  to the problem of convergence to saddle points  which is very unlikely with  steepest descent , it is possible for the algorithm to oscillate or diverge.  Steepest descent is guaranteed to converge, if the learning rate is not too  large or if we perform a linear minimization at each stage.  In Chapter 12 we will discuss a variation of Newton’s method that is well  suited to neural network training. It eliminates the divergence problem by  using steepest descent steps whenever divergence begins to occur.  Another problem with Newton’s method is that it requires the computation  and storage of the Hessian matrix, as well as its inverse. If we compare  steepest descent, Eq.  9.10 , with Newton’s method, Eq.  9.43 , we see that  their search directions will be identical when  Ak  =  1– Ak  =  I  .   9.50   This observation has lead to a class of optimization algorithms know as  quasi-Newton or one-step-secant methods. These methods replace    with a positive definite matrix,  ,which is updated at each iteration with- out matrix inversion. The algorithms are typically designed so that for qua- dratic functions  quadratic functions.  See [Gill81], [Scal85] or [Batt92] for a discussion of  these methods.  .

Unfortunately, it requires calculation and storage of the second  derivatives. When the number of parameters,  , is large, it may be imprac- tical to compute all of the second derivatives.  Note that the gradient has   elements.  This is especially true  n with neural networks, where practical applications can require several  hundred to many thousand weights. For these cases we would like to have  methods that require only first derivatives but still have quadratic termi- nation.   elements, while the Hessian has   n2  n  Recall the performance of the steepest descent algorithm, with linear  searches at each iteration. The search directions at consecutive iterations  were orthogonal  see Figure 9.4 . For quadratic functions with elliptical   9  9-15   9 Performance Optimization  contours this produces a zig-zag trajectory of short steps. Perhaps quadrat- ic search directions are not the best choice. Is there a set of search direc- tions that will guarantee quadratic termination? One possibility is  conjugate directions.  Suppose that we wish to locate the minimum of the following quadratic  function:  Conjugate  pk A set of vectors   nite Hessian matrix    is mutually conjugate with respect to a positive defi- A   if and only if  F x   =  1 ---xTAx dTx 2  +  +  c  .

Therefore the eigenvectors are both conju- gate and orthogonal.  Can you find a quadratic function where all  orthogonal vectors are also conjugate?   It is not surprising that we can minimize a quadratic function exactly by  searching along the eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix, since they form the  principal axes of the function contours.  See the discussion on pages 8-13  through 8-19.  Unfortunately this is not of much practical help, since to  find the eigenvectors we must first find the Hessian matrix. We want to  find an algorithm that does not require the computation of second deriva- tives.  It can be shown  see [Scal85] or [Gill81]  that if we make a sequence of ex- p1 p2   pn act linear searches along any set of conjugate directions  ,   then the exact minimum of any quadratic function, with   parameters, will  n be reached in at most   searches. The question is “How can we construct  these conjugate search directions?” First, we want to restate the conjugacy  condition, which is given in Eq.  9.52 , without use of the Hessian matrix.  Recall that for quadratic functions    n          F x   =  Ax d+  ,  2  F x   A=  .   9.54    9.55   9-16   Conjugate Gradient  By combining these equations we find that the change in the gradient at  iteration    is  1+  k  gk  =  gk  1+  gk–  =    Axk  1+  d+   Axk d+ –      =  A xk  ,   9.56   where, from Eq.  9.2 , we have   xk  =    xk  1+  xk–    =  kpk  ,   9.57   and   k   is chosen to minimize   F x    in the direction   pk  .  We can now restate the conjugacy conditions  Eq.  9.52  :  kpk  TApj  =  T Apj xk  =  T pj gk  =  0  k  j  .   9.58   Note that we no longer need to know the Hessian matrix. We have restated  the conjugacy conditions in terms of the changes in the gradient at succes- sive iterations of the algorithm. The search directions will be conjugate if  they are orthogonal to the changes in the gradient.  Note that the first search direction,  tor that is orthogonal to  of conjugate vectors.

Conjugate Gradient  To summarize our discussion, the conjugate gradient method consists of  the following steps:  1. Select the first search direction to be the negative of the gradient, as in   Eq.  9.59 .  2. Take a step according to Eq.  9.57 , selecting the learning rate   k   to   minimize the function along the search direction. We will discuss gen- eral linear minimization techniques in Chapter 12.

If the algorithm has not converged, return to step 2.  2 2+  To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, recall the example we used  to demonstrate steepest descent with linear minimization:  with initial guess  The gradient of this function is  F x   =  1 ---xT 2 1 2 1 2  x  ,  x0  =  0.8 0.25  –  .    F x   =  2x1 x2+ 2x2 + x1  .  As with steepest descent, the first search direction is the negative of the  gradient:  p0  =  g0–  =  –  F x   T  =  x x0=  1.35 – 0.3–  .  9-18   9.64    9.65    9.66    9.67    Conjugate Gradient  From Eq.  9.31 , the learning rate for the first iteration will be  0  =  –  1.35 0.3  1.35 – 0.3–  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1.35 – 0.3–  2 1 1 2  0.3–  1.35  –  =  0.413  .   9.68   The first step of conjugate gradient is therefore:  x1  =  x0 0p0  +  =  0.8 0.25  –  +  0.413  1.35 – 0.3–  =  0.24 – 0.37  ,   9.69   which is equivalent to the first step of steepest descent with minimization  along a line.  Now we need to find the second search direction from Eq.  9.60 . This re- quires the gradient at   :  x1  g1  =    F x   =  x x1=  2 1 1 2  0.24 0.37 –  =  0.11 0.5–  .   9.70   We can now find   1  :  1  =  Tg1 g1 ----------- Tg0 g0  0.11 0.11 0.5– 0.5– --------------------------------------------  =  1.35 0.3  1.35 0.3  =  0.2621 ---------------- 1.9125  =  0.137  ,   9.71   using the method of Fletcher and Reeves  Eq.  9.62  . The second search di- rection is then computed from Eq.  9.60 :  p1  =  g1–  +  1p0  =  –  0.11 0.5  +  0.137  1.35 – 0.3–  =  0.295 – 0.459  .   9.72   9  From Eq.  9.31 , the learning rate for the second iteration will be  1  =  –  0.11 0.5–  – 0.295 0.459  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 0.295 – 0.459  2 1 1 2  0.295  0.459  –  =  0.262 ------------- 0.325  =  0.807  .   9.73   9-19   9 Performance Optimization  The second step of conjugate gradient is therefore   x2  =  x1 1p1  +  =  0.24 0.37 –  +  0.807  0.295 – 0.459  =  .  0 0   9.74   As predicted, the algorithm converges exactly to the minimum in two iter- ations  since this is a two-dimensional quadratic function , as illustrated in  Figure 9.10. Compare this result with the steepest descent algorithm, as  shown in Figure 9.4. The conjugate gradient algorithm adjusts the second  search direction so that it will pass through the minimum of the function   center of the function contours , instead of using an orthogonal search di- rection, as in steepest descent.  -0.5  0  0.5  1  Figure 9.10  Conjugate Gradient Algorithm  We will return to the conjugate gradient algorithm in Chapter 12.

Take two  steps of the steepest descent algorithm, minimizing along a line at  each step. Use the following initial condition:  x0  =  0 2–  T  .  In Problem P9.1 we found the gradient of the function to be    F x   =  Ax d+  =  10 6– 6– 10  x  +  .  4 4  If we evaluate this at   x0  , we find  g0  =    F x0    =  Ax0 d+  =  10 6– 6– 10  0 2–  +  =  4 4  16 16–  .  Therefore the first search direction is  p0  =  g– 0  =  16– 16  .  9  To minimize along a line, for a quadratic function, we can use Eq.  9.31 :  0  =  –  Tp0 g0 ---------------- TAp0 p0  16 16–  16– 16  =  –  -------------------------------------------------------- 16– 16  10 6– 6– 10  16–  16  =  –  512 – ------------ 8192  =  0.0625  .  9-25   9 Performance Optimization  Therefore the first iteration of steepest descent will be  x1  =  x0 0g0  –  =  0 2–  –  0.0625 16 16–  =  .  1– 1–  To begin the second iteration we need to find the gradient at   x1  :  g1  =  F x1     =  Ax1 d+  =  10 6– 6– 10  1– 1–  +  =  4 4  .  0 0  Therefore we have reached a stationary point; the algorithm has con- verged.

For those cases where every di- rection is an eigenvector, the steepest descent algorithm will always locate  the minimum in one iteration.

The basis for  these algorithms is the Taylor series expansion. Steepest descent is derived  by using a first-order expansion, whereas Newton’s method and conjugate  gradient are designed for second-order  quadratic  functions.   Steepest descent has the advantage that it is very simple, requiring calcu- lation only of the gradient. It is also guaranteed to converge to a stationary  point if the learning rate is small enough. The disadvantage of steepest de- scent is that training times are generally longer than for other algorithms.  This is especially true when the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, for qua- dratic functions, have a wide range of magnitudes.  Newton’s method is generally much faster than steepest descent. For qua- dratic functions it will locate a stationary point in one iteration. One disad- vantage is that it requires calculation and storage of the Hessian matrix,  as well as its inverse. In addition, the convergence properties of Newton’s  method are quite complex. In Chapter 12 we will introduce a modification  of Newton’s method that overcomes some of the disadvantages of the stan- dard algorithm.  The conjugate gradient algorithm is something of a compromise between  steepest descent and Newton’s method. It will locate the minimum of a qua- dratic function in a finite number of iterations, but it does not require cal- culation and storage of the Hessian matrix. It is well suited to problems  with large numbers of parameters, where it is impractical to compute and  store the Hessian.  In later chapters we will apply each of these optimization algorithms to the  training of neural networks. In Chapter 10 we will demonstrate how an ap- proximate steepest descent algorithm, Widrow-Hoff learning, can be used  to train linear networks. In Chapter 11 we generalize Widrow-Hoff learn- ing to train multilayer networks. In Chapter 12 the conjugate gradient al- gorithm, and a variation of Newton’s method, are used to speed up the  training of multilayer networks.  9  9-37   9 Performance Optimization  Further Reading  [Batt92]  R.

In this chap- ter we apply the principles of performance learning to a single-layer linear  neural network.   Widrow-Hoff learning is an approximate steepest descent algorithm, in  which the performance index is mean square error. This algorithm is im- portant to our discussion for two reasons. First, it is widely used today in  many signal processing applications, several of which we will discuss in  this chapter. In addition, it is the precursor to the backpropagation algo- rithm for multilayer networks, which is presented in Chapter 11  10  10-1   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  Theory and Examples  Bernard Widrow began working in neural networks in the late 1950s, at  about the same time that Frank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron  learning rule. In 1960 Widrow, and his graduate student Marcian Hoff, in- troduced the ADALINE  ADAptive LInear NEuron  network, and a learn- ing rule which they called the LMS  Least Mean Square  algorithm  [WiHo60].   Their ADALINE network is very similar to the perceptron, except that its  transfer function is linear, instead of hard-limiting. Both the ADALINE  and the perceptron suffer from the same inherent limitation: they can only  solve linearly separable problems  recall our discussion in Chapters 3 and  4 . The LMS algorithm, however, is more powerful than the perceptron  learning rule. While the perceptron rule is guaranteed to converge to a so- lution that correctly categorizes the training patterns, the resulting net- work can be sensitive to noise, since patterns often lie close to the decision  boundaries. The LMS algorithm minimizes mean square error, and there- fore tries to move the decision boundaries as far from the training patterns  as possible.  The LMS algorithm has found many more practical uses than the percep- tron learning rule. This is especially true in the area of digital signal pro- cessing. For example, most long distance phone lines use ADALINE  networks for echo cancellation. We will discuss these applications in detail  later in the chapter.   Because of the great success of the LMS algorithm in signal processing ap- plications, and because of the lack of success in adapting the algorithm to  multilayer networks, Widrow stopped work on neural networks in the early  1960s and began to work full time on adaptive signal processing. He re- turned to the neural network field in the 1980s and began research on the  use of neural networks in adaptive control, using temporal backpropaga- tion, a descendant of his original LMS algorithm.  ADALINE Network  The ADALINE network is shown in Figure 10.1. Notice that it has the  same basic structure as the perceptron network we discussed in Chapter 4.  The only difference is that it has a linear transfer function.  10-2   ADALINE Network  Input  Linear Neuron  p R x 1  1   cid:0 W n cid:0   cid:0 b  S x R  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a S x 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   S x 1  S  R  a = purelin  Wp + b   Figure 10.1  ADALINE Network  The output of the network is given by  a  =  purelin Wp b+     Wp b+  =  .   10.1   Recall from our discussion of the perceptron network that the ith element  of the network output vector can be written  ai  =  purelin ni    =  purelin wT    i  p bi+    =  wT  i  p bi+  ,   10.2   where   wi   is made up of the elements of the ith row of   W  :  wi  =  wi 1 wi 2  wi R  .  Single ADALINE To simplify our discussion, let’s consider a single ADALINE with two in- puts. The diagram for this network is shown in Figure 10.2.  The output of the network is given by   10.3   a  =  purelin n   =  purelin wT    1  p b+    =  wT  p b+  1  =  wT 1  p b+  =  w1 1 p1 w1 2 p2  +  +  b .   10.4   10  10-3   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  Inputs  Two-Input Neuron  p1  p2   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w1,1 n  cid:0  cid:0  w1,2  b   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0   1  a = purelin  Wp + b   Figure 10.2  Two-Input Linear Neuron  You may recall from Chapter 4 that the perceptron has a decision bound- ary, which is determined by the input vectors for which the net input   is  zero. Now, does the ADALINE also have such a boundary? Clearly it does.  If we set   specifies such a line, as shown in Figure  10.3.   then   p b+  wT 1  0=  0=  n  n  p2  a < 0  -b w1,2  1wTp + b = 0  a > 0  1w  p1  -b w1,1  Figure 10.3  Decision Boundary for Two-Input ADALINE  The neuron output is greater than 0 in the gray area. In the white area the  output is less than zero. Now, what does this imply about the ADALINE?  It says that the ADALINE can be used to classify objects into two catego- ries. However, it can do so only if the objects are linearly separable. Thus,  in this respect, the ADALINE has the same limitation as the perceptron.  Mean Square Error  Now that we have examined the characteristics of the ADALINE network,  we are ready to begin our development of the LMS algorithm. As with the  perceptron rule, the LMS algorithm is an example of supervised training,  in which the learning rule is provided with a set of examples of proper  network behavior:  10-4   Mean Square Error  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ  {      ,  }  ,   10.5   pq   is an input to the network, and   where  output. As each input is applied to the network, the network output is com- pared to the target.    is the corresponding target   tq  The LMS algorithm will adjust the weights and biases of the ADALINE in  order to minimize the mean square error, where the error is the difference  between the target output and the network output. In this section we want  to discuss this performance index. We will consider first the single-neuron  case.  To simply our development, we will lump all of the parameters we are  adjusting, including the bias, into one vector:  Similarly, we include the bias input “1” as a component of the input vector  Now the network output, which we usually write in the form  can be written as  x  =  w1 b  .  z  =  .  p 1  a  =  wT 1  p  b+  ,  a  =  xTz  .   10.6    10.7    10.8    10.9   Mean Square Error  This allows us to conveniently write out an expression for the ADALINE  network mean square error:  F x  E e2   =    =  E t  a–    2   =  E t  –    xTz  2   ,   10.10   E     where the expectation is taken over all sets of input target pairs.  Here we  use   to denote expected value. We use a generalized definition of ex- pectation, which becomes a time-average for deterministic signals. See  [WiSt85].  We can expand this expression as follows:  F x  E t2   =  –  2txTz  +  xTzzTx    =  E t2    –  2xTE tz    +  xTE zzT    x .   10.11   10  10-5   Correlation Matrix  10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  This can be written in the following convenient form:  F x   =  c  –  2xTh  +  xTRx  ,   10.12   where  c  =  E t2    ,   h  =  E tz     and   R  =  E zzT     .   10.13   h   gives the cross-correlation between the input vector and  Here the vector  its associated target, while   is the input correlation matrix. The diagonal  elements of this matrix are equal to the mean square values of the elements  of the input vectors.  R  Take a close look at Eq.  10.12 , and compare it with the general form of the  quadratic function given in Eq.  8.35  and repeated here:  F x   =  c dTx +  +  1 ---xTAx 2  .   10.14   We can see that the mean square error performance index for the ADA- LINE network is a quadratic function, where  d  2h–=   and   A  2R=  .   10.15   This is a very important result, because we know from Chapter 8 that the  characteristics of the quadratic function depend primarily on the Hessian  matrix  . For example, if the eigenvalues of the Hessian are all positive,  then the function will have one unique global minimum.   A  R  In this case the Hessian matrix is twice the correlation matrix  , and it  can be shown that all correlation matrices are either positive definite or  positive semidefinite, which means that they can never have negative  eigenvalues. We are left with two possibilities. If the correlation matrix has  only positive eigenvalues, the performance index will have one unique glo- bal minimum  see Figure 8.7 . If the correlation matrix has some zero  eigenvalues, the performance index will either have a weak minimum  see  Figure 8.9  or no minimum  see Problem P8.7 , depending on the vector  d Now let’s locate the stationary point of the performance index. From our  previous discussion of quadratic functions we know that the gradient is  2h–=  .  F x   =   c dTx  +  +     1  ---xTAx  2  =  d Ax+  =  2h–  +  2Rx  .   10.16   The stationary point of  zero:  F x    can be found by setting the gradient equal to   2h–  +  2Rx  0=  .   10.17   10-6   LMS Algorithm  LMS Algorithm  Therefore, if the correlation matrix is positive definite there will be a  unique stationary point, which will be a strong minimum:  x  =  R 1– h  .   10.18   It is worth noting here that the existence of a unique solution depends only  on the correlation matrix  . Therefore the characteristics of the input vec- tors determine whether or not a unique solution exists.  R  Now that we have analyzed our performance index, the next step is to de- sign an algorithm to locate the minimum point. If we could calculate the  , we could find the minimum point directly  statistical quantities  from Eq.  10.18 . If we did not want to calculate the inverse of  , we could  use the steepest descent algorithm, with the gradient calculated from Eq.  h  10.16 . In general, however, it is not desirable or convenient to calculate    . For this reason we will use an approximate steepest descent algo- and  rithm, in which we use an estimated gradient.    and   R  R  R  h  The key insight of Widrow and Hoff was that they could estimate the mean  square error    by  F x   Fˆ x   =    t k   –  a k   2  =  e2 k   ,   10.19   where the expectation of the squared error has been replaced by the  squared error at iteration  timate of the form:  . Then, at each iteration we have a gradient es-  k  ˆ F x   =  e2 k   .   10.20   This is sometimes referred to as the stochastic gradient. When this is used  in a gradient descent algorithm, it is referred to as “on-line” or incremental  learning, since the weights are updated as each input is presented to the  network.

In a similar way we can obtain the final element of the gradient:  Note that  ent of the squared error at iteration   pj k    and   1  k   can be written   are the elements of the input vector   , so the gradi-  z  ˆ F x   =    e2 k   =  –  2e k z k   .   10.26   Now we can see the beauty of approximating the mean square error by the  single error at iteration  , as in Eq.  10.19 . To calculate this approximate  gradient we need only multiply the error times the input.  k  This approximation to   can now be used in the steepest descent algo- rithm.

This is also referred to as the delta rule or the Widrow-Hoff learning algo- rithm.

For  simplicity we will assume that the ADALINE network has a zero bias.  The LMS weight update algorithm of Eq.  10.29  will be used to calculate  the new weights at each step in the network training:  W k  1+   W k   =  +  2e k pT k   .   10.47   First let’s compute the maximum stable learning rate  . We can get such  a value by finding the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix. Recall  that the orange and apple vectors and their associated targets are          1 1– 1–              1 1 1–  .        p1  =  t1  =  1–  p2  =  t2  =  1   10.48   If we assume that the input vectors are generated randomly with equal  probability, we can compute the input correlation matrix:  R  =  E ppT     =  1 T ---p1p1 2  +  1 T ---p2p2 2  =  1 --- 2  1 1– 1–  +  1 --- 2  1 1 1–  1 0 1– 0 1 0 1– 0 1   .  1 1–  1–  1 1 1–  =   10.49   The eigenvalues of   R   are  1  =   1.0  2  =   0.0  3  2.0=  .   10.50   Thus, the maximum stable learning rate is      1 ----------- max  =  1 ------- 2.0  =  0.5  .   10.51   To be conservative we will pick  tions it might not be practical to calculate  trial and error. Other techniques for choosing   0.2  R    =  .  Note that in practical applica-  , and      could be selected by      are given in [WiSt85].   We will start, arbitrarily, with all the weights set to zero, and then will ap- ply inputs  , etc., in that order, calculating the new weights  after each input is presented.  The presentation of the weights in alternat-  p1 p2 p1 p2  ,   ,   ,   10  10-11   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  ing order is not necessary. A random sequence would be fine.  Presenting  p1  , the orange, and using its target of -1 we get  a 0  W 0 p 0  W 0 p1  =  =  =  0 0 0  0=  ,   10.52   and  e 0   =  t 0   –  a 0   =  –  a 0   =  1–  1–=–  0  .  t1   10.53   Now we can calculate the new weight matrix:  W 1  W 0   =  +  2e 0 pT 0   =  0 0 0  +  2 0.2    1–    =  0.4–  0.4 0.4  .   10.54   T  1 1– 1–  According to plan, we will next present the apple,   , and its target of 1:  a 1  W 1 p 1  W 1 p2  =  =  =  0.4–  0.4 0.4  0.4–=  ,   10.55   e 1   =  t 1   –  a 1   =  –  a 1   =  1  –  0.4–    =  1.4  .  t2   10.56   and so the error is  Now we calculate the new weights:  W 2  W 1   =  +  2e 1 pT 1   =  0.4–  0.4 0.4  +  2 0.2   1.4    0.16 0.96 0.16  –   .   10.57   T  =  1 1 1–  Next we present the orange again:  a 2  W 2 p 2  W 2 p1  =  =  =  0.16 0.96 0.16  –  –=  0.64  .   10.58   1 1– 1–  p2  1 1 1–  1 1– 1–  10-12   Adaptive Filtering  The error is  The new weights are  e 2   =  t 2   –  a 2   =  t1 a 2   –  =  1–  –  –  0.64    –=  0.36  .   10.59   W 3  W 2   =  +  2e 2 pT 2   =  0.016 1.1040 0.0160  –  .   10.60   If we continue this procedure, the algorithm converges to  W     =  0 1 0  .   10.61   Compare this result with the result of the perceptron learning rule in  Chapter 4. You will notice that the ADALINE has produced the same deci- sion boundary that we designed in Chapter 3 for the apple orange problem.  This boundary falls halfway between the two reference patterns. The per- ceptron rule did not produce such a boundary. This is because the percep- tron rule stops as soon as the patterns are correctly classified, even though  some patterns may be close to the boundaries. The LMS algorithm mini- mizes the mean square error. Therefore it tries to move the decision bound- aries as far from the reference patterns as possible.  Adaptive Filtering  As we mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the ADALINE network  has the same major limitation as the perceptron network; it can only solve  linearly separable problems. In spite of this, the ADALINE has been much  more widely used than the perceptron network. In fact, it is safe to say that  it is one of the most widely used neural networks in practical applications.  One of the major application areas of the ADALINE has been adaptive fil- tering, where it is still used extensively. In this section we will demonstrate  an adaptive filtering example.  Tapped Delay Line  In order to use the ADALINE network as an adaptive filter, we need to in- troduce a new building block, the tapped delay line. A tapped delay line  with    outputs is shown in Figure 10.4.  R  The input signal enters from the left. At the output of the tapped delay line  we have an  -dimensional vector, consisting of the input signal at the cur- rent time and at delays of from    time steps.  R 1–   to   R  1  10  10-13   Adaptive Filter  If we combine a tapped delay line with an ADALINE network, we can cre- ate an adaptive filter, as is shown in Figure 10.5. The output of the filter is  given by  a k   =  purelin Wp b+      =   w1 i y k  i–  1+    b+  .   10.62   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  y k   p1 k  = y k   p2 k  = y k - 1    cid:0 D   cid:0 D  cid:0  D  cid:0   pR k  = y k - R + 1   Figure 10.4  Tapped Delay Line  y k   R    i  1=  Inputs  ADALINE   cid:0 D  cid:0   cid:0 D  cid:0   cid:0 D  w1,1  w1,2  w1,R  SxR   cid:0 Σ  n k  a k   cid:0  cid:0   b  1  a k  = purelin  Wp k  + b   Figure 10.5  Adaptive Filter ADALINE  10-14   2 2+  Adaptive Filtering  If you are familiar with digital signal processing, you will recognize the net- work of Figure 10.5 as a finite impulse response  FIR  filter [WiSt85]. It is  beyond the scope of this text to review the field of digital signal processing,  but we can demonstrate the usefulness of this adaptive filter through a  simple, but practical, example.  Adaptive Noise Cancellation An adaptive filter can be used in a variety of novel ways. In the following  example we will use it for noise cancellation. Take some time to look at this  example, for it is a little different from what you might expect. For in- stance, the output “error” that the network tries to minimize is actually an  approximation to the signal we are trying to recover!  Let’s suppose that a doctor, in trying to review the electroencephalogram   EEG  of a distracted graduate student, finds that the signal he would like  to see has been contaminated by a 60-Hz noise source. He is examining the  patient on-line and wants to view the best signal that can be obtained. Fig- ure 10.6 shows how an adaptive filter can be used to remove the contami- nating signal.

The desired  output of the filter is the contaminated EEG signal  . The adaptive filter  will do its best to reproduce this contaminated signal, but it only knows  about the original noise source,  . Thus, it can only reproduce the part of    v t that is linearly correlated with  , which is  . In effect, the adaptive filter  v will attempt to mimic the noise path filter, so that the output of the filter   m  e  t  10  10-15   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning   will be close to the contaminating noise   a be close to the original uncontaminated EEG signal   m  s  .  . In this way the error   e   will   In this simple case of a single sine wave noise source, a neuron with two  weights and no bias is sufficient to implement the filter. The inputs to the  filter are the current and previous values of the noise source. Such a two- input filter can attenuate and phase-shift the noise   in the desired way.  The filter is shown in Figure 10.7.  v  Inputs  ADALINE  v k   w1,1   cid:0 D w1,2  cid:0   SxR   cid:0 Σ  n k  a k   cid:0  cid:0   a k  = w1,1 v k  + w1,2 v k - 1   Figure 10.7  Adaptive Filter for Noise Cancellation  We can apply the mathematical relationships developed in the previous  sections of this chapter to analyze this system.

This is what we expected, since the “error” of this adaptive  noise canceller is in fact the reconstructed EEG signal.  Figure 10.8 illustrates the trajectory of the LMS algorithm in the weight  space with learning rate   in this  simulation were initialized arbitrarily to 0 and -2, respectively. You can  see from this figure that the LMS trajectory looks like a noisy version of  steepest descent.  .

If the learning rate is decreased, the LMS trajectory is smoother than that  shown in Figure 10.8, but the learning proceeds more slowly. If the learn- ing rate is increased, the trajectory is more jagged and oscillatory. In fact,  as noted earlier in this chapter, if the learning rate is increased too much  the system does not converge at all. The maximum stable learning rate is   2 2.16  0.926    =  .  In order to judge the performance of our noise canceller, consider Figure  10.9. This figure illustrates how the filter adapts to cancel the noise. The  top graph shows the restored and original EEG signals. At first the re- stored signal is a poor approximation of the original EEG signal. It takes  about 0.2 second  with    for the filter to adjust to give a reasonable  restored signal. The mean square difference between the original and re- stored signal over the last half of the experiment was 0.002. This compares  favorably with the signal mean square value of 0.0133. The difference be- tween the original and restored signal is shown in the lower graph.  0.1    =  Original and Restored EEG Signals   Original and Restored EEG Signals  -1  -2 0  2  1  0  2  1  0  -1  -2 0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3  0.35  0.4  0.45  0.5  EEG Signal Minus Restored Signal  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.3  0.35  0.4  0.45  0.5  0.25 Time  Figure 10.9  Adaptive Filter Cancellation of Contaminating Noise  10-20   Adaptive Filtering  You might wonder why the error does not go to zero. This is because the  LMS algorithm is approximate steepest descent; it uses an estimate of the  gradient, not the true gradient, to update the weights. The estimate of the  gradient is a noisy version of the true gradient. This will cause the weights  to continue to change slightly, even after the mean square error is at the  minimum point. You can see this effect in Figure 10.8.  To experiment with the use of this adaptive noise cancellation filter, use the  MATLAB® Neural Network Design Demonstration Adaptive Noise Cancel- lation  nnd10nc . A more complex noise source and actual EEG data are used  in the Demonstration Electroencephalogram Noise Cancellation  nnd10eeg .  Echo Cancellation Another very important practical application of adaptive noise cancellation  is echo cancellation. Echoes are common in long distance telephone lines  because of impedance mismatch at the “hybrid” device that forms the junc- tion between the long distance line and the customer’s local line. You may  have experienced this effect on international telephone calls.  Figure 10.10 illustrates how an adaptive noise cancellation filter can be  used to reduce these echoes [WiWi85]. At the end of the long distance line  the incoming signal is sent to an adaptive filter, as well as to the hybrid de- vice. The target output of the filter is the output of the hybrid. The filter  thus tries to cancel the part of the hybrid output that is correlated with the  input signal — the echo.  +   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0 Transmission  -  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   Line   cid:0  cid:0 Phone   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0 Hybrid  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   Filter   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0 Adaptive  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   Adaptive   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   Hybrid  Filter   cid:0  cid:0  Phone   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0 Transmission   cid:0  cid:0  cid:0  cid:0   Line  -  +  Figure 10.10  Echo Cancellation System  10  10-21   10 Widrow-Hoff Learning  Summary of Results  ADALINE  Mean Square Error  Input  Linear Neuron  p R x 1  1   cid:0 W n cid:0   cid:0 b  S x R  S x 1   cid:0  cid:0  a S x 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   S x 1  S  R  a = purelin  Wp + b   F x  E e2   =    =  E t  a–    2   =  E t  –    xTz  2   F x   =  c  –  2xTh  +  xTRx  ,  c  =  E t2    ,   h  =  E tz     and   R  =  E zzT     Unique minimum, if it exists, is    x  =  R 1– h  .

The sound received by the air traffic controller in the tower is gar- bled because the pilot’s voice signal has been contaminated by en- gine noise that reaches his microphone. Can you suggest an  adaptive ADALINE filter that might help reduce the noise in the  signal received by the control tower? Explain your system.  The engine noise that has been inadvertently added to the microphone in- put can be minimized by using the adaptive filtering system shown in Fig- ure P10.8. A sample of the engine noise is supplied to an adaptive filter  through a microphone in the cockpit. The desired output of the filter is the  contaminated signal coming from the pilot’s microphone. The filter at- tempts to reduce the “error” signal to a minimum. It can do this only by  subtracting the component of the contaminated signal that is linearly cor- related with the engine noise  and presumably uncorrelated with the pilot’s  voice . The result is that a clear voice signal is sent to the control tower, in  spite of the fact that the engine noise got into the pilot’s microphone along  with his voice signal.

They wanted to  design a recognition system that would classify the six patterns  shown in Figure P10.11.

The targets for  these letters  in their original and shifted forms  are +60, 0 and -60,  respectively.  The values of 60, 0 and -60 were nice for use on the  face of a meter that Widrow and Hoff used to display their network  output.  The objective is to train a network so that it will classify  the six patterns into the appropriate T, G or F groups.  The blue squares in the letters will be assigned the value +1, and the white  squares will be assigned the value -1. First we convert each of the letters  into a single 16-element vector. We choose to do this by starting at the up- per left corner, going down the left column, then going down the second col- umn, etc. For example, the vector corresponding to the unshifted letter T is  p1  =  1 1–  1–  1– 1 1 1 1 1 1–  1–  1–  1–  1–  1–  1–  T  We have such an input vector for each of the six letters.

The ADALINE network is very similar to the percep- tron network of Chapter 4, and it has the same fundamental limitation: it  can only classify linearly separable patterns. In spite of this limitation on  the network, the LMS algorithm is in fact more powerful than the percep- tron learning rule. Because it minimizes mean square error, the algorithm  is able to create decision boundaries that are more robust to noise than  those of the perceptron learning rule.  The ADALINE network and the LMS algorithm have found many practical  applications. Even though they were first presented in the late 1950s, they  are still very much in use in adaptive filtering applications. For example,  echo cancellers using the LMS algorithm are currently employed on many  long distance telephone lines.  Chapter 14 provides more extensive cover- age of dynamic networks, which are widely used for filtering, prediction  and control.   In addition to its importance as a practical solution to many adaptive fil- tering problems, the LMS algorithm is also important because it is the fore- runner of the backpropagation algorithm, which we will discuss in  Chapters 11 through 14. Like the LMS algorithm, backpropagation is an  approximate steepest descent algorithm that minimizes mean square er- ror. The only difference between the two algorithms is in the manner in  which the derivatives are calculated. Backpropagation is a generalization  of the LMS algorithm that can be used for multilayer networks. These more  complex networks are not limited to linearly separable problems. They can  solve arbitrary classification problems.  10-40   Further Reading  Further Reading  [AnRo89]  J. A. Anderson, E.

This generalization, called backpropagation, can be  used to train multilayer networks. As with the LMS learning law, back- propagation is an approximate steepest descent algorithm, in which the  performance index is mean square error. The difference between the LMS  algorithm and backpropagation is only in the way in which the derivatives  are calculated. For a single-layer linear network the error is an explicit lin- ear function of the network weights, and its derivatives with respect to the  weights can be easily computed. In multilayer networks with nonlinear  transfer functions, the relationship between the network weights and the  error is more complex. In order to calculate the derivatives, we need to use  the chain rule of calculus. In fact, this chapter is in large part a demonstra- tion of how to use the chain rule.  11-1  11   11 Backpropagation  Theory and Examples  The perceptron learning rule of Frank Rosenblatt and the LMS algorithm  of Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff were designed to train single-layer  perceptron-like networks. As we have discussed in previous chapters, these  single-layer networks suffer from the disadvantage that they are only able  to solve linearly separable classification problems. Both Rosenblatt and  Widrow were aware of these limitations and proposed multilayer networks  that could overcome them, but they were not able to generalize their algo- rithms to train these more powerful networks.   Apparently the first description of an algorithm to train multilayer net- works was contained in the thesis of Paul Werbos in 1974 [Werbo74]. This  thesis presented the algorithm in the context of general networks, with  neural networks as a special case, and was not disseminated in the neural  network community. It was not until the mid 1980s that the backpropaga- tion algorithm was rediscovered and widely publicized. It was rediscovered  independently by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton and Ronald Williams  [RuHi86], David Parker [Park85], and Yann Le Cun [LeCu85]. The algo- rithm was popularized by its inclusion in the book Parallel Distributed Pro- cessing [RuMc86], which described the work of the Parallel Distributed  Processing Group led by psychologists David Rumelhart and James Mc- Clelland. The publication of this book spurred a torrent of research in neu- ral networks. The multilayer perceptron, trained by the backpropagation  algorithm, is currently the most widely used neural network.  In this chapter we will first investigate the capabilities of multilayer net- works and then present the backpropagation algorithm.  We first introduced the notation for multilayer networks in Chapter 2. For  ease of reference we have reproduced the diagram of the three-layer per- ceptron in Figure 11.1. Note that we have simply cascaded three percep- tron networks. The output of the first network is the input to the second  network, and the output of the second network is the input to the third net- work. Each layer may have a different number of neurons, and even a dif- ferent transfer function. Recall from Chapter 2 that we are using  superscripts to identify the layer number. Thus, the weight matrix for the  first layer is written as   and the weight matrix for the second layer is  written   W1  .   W2  To identify the structure of a multilayer network, we will sometimes use  the following shorthand notation, where the number of inputs is followed  by the number of neurons in each layer:  R S1–  S2–  S3–  .   11.1   11-2  Multilayer Perceptrons   Multilayer Perceptrons  w 11,1  a11  w 21,1  a21  w 31,1  Inputs  First Layer  p1  p2  p3  pR  1  b11   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n11  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n12  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n1S 1  cid:0  cid:0  b1S 1  b12  1   cid:0 f 1  cid:0   cid:0 f 1  cid:0   cid:0  f 1  cid:0   1  a12  a1S 1  w 1S 1, R  Second Layer  1  b21   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n21  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n22  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n2S 2  cid:0  cid:0  b2S 2  b22  1   cid:0 f 2  cid:0   cid:0 f 2  cid:0   cid:0  f 2  cid:0   1  a22  a2S 2  w 2S 2, S 1  w 3S 3, S 2  Third Layer  1  b31   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n31  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n32  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n3S 3  cid:0  cid:0   b3S 3  b32  1   cid:0 f 3  cid:0   cid:0 f 3  cid:0   cid:0  f 3  cid:0   1  a31  a32  a3S 3  a1 = f 1  W1p + b1   a2 = f 2  W2a1 + b2   a3 = f 3  W3a2 + b3   2 2+  p4  p3  p2  p1  a3 = f 3  W3f 2  W2f 1  W1p + b1  + b2  + b3   Figure 11.1  Three-Layer Network  Let’s now investigate the capabilities of these multilayer perceptron net- works. First we will look at the use of multilayer networks for pattern clas- sification, and then we will discuss their application to function  approximation.  Pattern Classification To illustrate the capabilities of the multilayer perceptron for pattern clas- sification, consider the classic exclusive-or  XOR  problem.

Because the two categories are not linearly sepa- rable, a single-layer perceptron cannot perform the classification.  A two-layer network can solve the XOR problem. In fact, there are many  different multilayer solutions. One solution is to use two neurons in the  first layer to create two decision boundaries. The first boundary separates  p1 . Then  the second layer is used to combine the two boundaries together using an    from the other patterns, and the second boundary separates   p4  11-3  11   11 Backpropagation  AND operation.

Function Approximation Up to this point in the text we have viewed neural networks mainly in the  context of pattern classification. It is also instructive to view networks as  function approximators. In control systems, for example, the objective is to  find an appropriate feedback function that maps from measured outputs to  control inputs. In adaptive filtering  Chapter 10  the objective is to find a  function that maps from delayed values of an input signal to an appropri- ate output signal. The following example will illustrate the flexibility of the  multilayer perceptron for implementing functions.  11-4   Multilayer Perceptrons  2 2+  Consider the two-layer, 1-2-1 network shown in Figure 11.4. For this exam- ple the transfer function for the first layer is log-sigmoid and the transfer  function for the second layer is linear. In other words,  f1 n   =   and   f2 n   n=  .  1 ---------------- e n–+ 1   11.2   Input  Log-Sigmoid Layer  Linear Layer  p  w11,1  w12,1  b11   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n11  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n12  cid:0  cid:0   b12  1   cid:0  cid:0  a11  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a12  cid:0  cid:0   1  w21,1   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n2  cid:0  cid:0  w21,2  b2   cid:0   cid:0   1  a2  a1 = logsig  W1p + b1   a2 = purelin  W2a1 + b2   Figure 11.4  Example Function Approximation Network  Suppose that the nominal values of the weights and biases for this network  are  1  w1 1  10=  ,   1  w2 1  10=  ,   1 b1  10–=  ,   1 b2  10=  ,  2  w1 1  1=  ,   2  w1 2  1=  ,   b2  0=  .

By adjusting the network parameters we  can change the shape and location of each step, as we will see in the follow- ing discussion.  The centers of the steps occur where the net input to a neuron in the first  layer is zero:  1 w1 1 1 p = n1  1+ b1  =  0    p  =  –   11.3   1 b1 1---------- w1 1  =  –  10– --------- 10  =  1  ,  11-5  11   11 Backpropagation  1 w2 1 1 p = n2  1+ b2  =  0    p  =  –   11.4   1 b2 1---------- w2 1  =  10 ------– 10  =  1–  .

The blue curve is the nominal response. The other curves corre- spond to the network response when one parameter at a time is varied over  the following ranges:  1–    2  w1 1    1  ,   1–    2  w1 2    1  ,   0    1 b2    20  ,   1–    b2    1  .   11.5   Figure 11.6  a  shows how the network biases in the first  hidden  layer can  be used to locate the position of the steps. Figure 11.6  b  illustrates how  the weights determine the slope of the steps. The bias in the second  out- put  layer shifts the entire network response up or down, as can be seen in  Figure 11.6  d .  From this example we can see how flexible the multilayer network is. It  would appear that we could use such networks to approximate almost any  function, if we had a sufficient number of neurons in the hidden layer. In  fact, it has been shown that two-layer networks, with sigmoid transfer  functions in the hidden layer and linear transfer functions in the output  layer, can approximate virtually any function of interest to any degree of  accuracy, provided sufficiently many hidden units are available  see  [HoSt89] .

As each input is applied to the network, the network output is com- pared to the target. The algorithm should adjust the network parameters  in order to minimize the mean square error:   is the corresponding target out-  tq  F x  E e2   =    =  E t  a–    2   .   11.10   where  the network has multiple outputs this generalizes to   is the vector of network weights and biases  as in Chapter 10 .

So far, this development is identical to that for the LMS algorithm. Now we  come to the difficult part – the computation of the partial derivatives.  Chain Rule For a single-layer linear network  the ADALINE  these partial derivatives  are conveniently computed using Eq.  10.33  and Eq.  10.34 . For the mul- tilayer network the error is not an explicit function of the weights in the  hidden layers, therefore these derivatives are not computed so easily.   Because the error is an indirect function of the weights in the hidden lay- ers, we will use the chain rule of calculus to calculate the derivatives. To  review the chain rule, suppose that we have a function   that is an explicit  function only of the variable  respect to a third variable  w  n . The chain rule is then:  . We want to take the derivative of    with   f  f  f n w    d ---------------------- wd  =  f n  d ------------ nd    n w  d --------------- wd  .   11.15   f n   en=   and   n  2w=  , so that   f n w       =  e2w  ,   11.16   f n w    d ---------------------- wd  =  f n  d ------------ nd    n w  d --------------- wd  =  en   2   .  We will use this concept to find the derivatives in Eq.  11.13  and Eq.   11.14 :  2 2+  For example, if  then   11.17    11.18    11.19   11  Fˆ ----------- m wi j Fˆ --------- m bi  =  =  Fˆ --------- m ni Fˆ --------- m ni      m ni ----------- m wi j  ,  m ni --------- m bi  .  11-9   11 Backpropagation  The second term in each of these equations can be easily computed, since  the net input to layer   is an explicit function of the weights and bias in  that layer:  m  m ni  =  m 1–  m aj wi j  m+ bi  .   11.20   Sm 1–   j  1=  Therefore  If we now define  m ni ----------- m wi j  =  m 1– aj  ,   1=  .  m ni --------- m bi  Sensitivity   the sensitivity of  m  Fˆ   , then Eq.  11.18  and Eq.  11.19  can be simplified to   to changes in the ith element of the net input at layer   m si    Fˆ --------- m ni  ,  =  Fˆ ----------- m wi j Fˆ --------- m bi  m 1–  maj si  ,  m= si  .  We can now express the approximate steepest descent algorithm as  In matrix form this becomes:  m k  1+  wi j    =  m k  si wi j  –  maj  m 1–  ,  m k 1+ bi    =  m k  si bi  –  m  .

Backpropagating the Sensitivities It now remains for us to compute the sensitivities  other application of the chain rule. It is this process that gives us the term  backpropagation, because it describes a recurrence relationship in which  the sensitivity at layer  . m 1+   is computed from the sensitivity at layer   , which requires an-  sm  m  To derive the recurrence relationship for the sensitivities, we will use the  following Jacobian matrix:  nm 1+  ---------------- nm    m 1+ m 1+   n1 n1 ---------------  --------------- m m n2 n1 m 1+ m 1+   n2 n2 ---------------  --------------- m m n2 n1   m 1+ m 1+   n n Sm 1+ Sm 1+ ---------------  --------------- m m n2 n1  m 1+  n1 --------------- m n Sm m 1+  n2 --------------- m n Sm  m 1+  n Sm 1+ --------------- m n Sm  .   11.30   Next we want to find an expression for this matrix. Consider the i,    j ele- ment of the matrix:  11-11  11   11 Backpropagation    Sm   m 1+ al wi l      m 1+ bi     ---------------------------------------------------------  1=  +  m  l  m 1+  ni --------------- m nj  =  =  m 1+  wi j  m aj --------- m nj  m nj  fm nj m   ------------------- m nj  =  m 1+  wi j  m 1+ f· m wi j  m nj   ,  =   11.31   where  where  Therefore the Jacobian matrix can be written  f·m  m nj    =  m fm nj   ------------------- m nj  .  nm 1+  ---------------- Wm 1+ F· m nm nm  =    ,  F· m nm    =  f·m  m n1    0   0  f·m    0  0  0 m n2  0  f·m  .    m n Sm     11.32    11.33    11.34   We can now write out the recurrence relation for the sensitivity by using  the chain rule in matrix form:  sm  =  Fˆ --------- nm  =       T nm 1+  ----------------  nm   Fˆ ---------------- nm 1+   F· m nm   Wm 1+   T  =  Fˆ ---------------- nm 1+   F· m nm     Wm 1+   Tsm 1+  .  =   11.35   Now we can see where the backpropagation algorithm derives its name.  The sensitivities are propagated backward through the network from the  last layer to the first layer:  sM    sM 1–       s2  s1  .   11.36   11-12   The Backpropagation Algorithm  At this point it is worth emphasizing that the backpropagation algorithm  uses the same approximate steepest descent technique that we used in the  LMS algorithm. The only complication is that in order to compute the gra- dient we need to first backpropagate the sensitivities. The beauty of back- propagation is that we have a very efficient implementation of the chain  rule.  We still have one more step to make in order to complete the backpropaga- tion algorithm. We need the starting point,  , for the recurrence relation  of Eq.  11.35 . This is obtained at the final layer:  sM  M si  =  Fˆ --------- M ni  a– a– t   -------------------------------------  =  =  T t M ni  =  –  ai– 2 ti     11.37   ai --------- M ni  .

This can be expressed in matrix form as 2F· M nM   –=  sM    t a–    .  Summary Let’s summarize the backpropagation algorithm. The first step is to propa- gate the input forward through the network:  am 1+  =  fm 1+ Wm 1+ am bm 1+  +       for   m  =  0 1   M 1–       ,   11.42   a0  p=  ,  a  aM=  .  The next step is to propagate the sensitivities backward through the net- work:  sM  –=  2F· M nM     t a–    ,  11-13  11   11.38    11.39    11.40    11.41    11.43    11.44    Example  2 2+  11 Backpropagation  sm  =  F· m nm     Wm 1+   Tsm 1+  , for   m M 1–   2 1  =        .   11.45   Finally, the weights and biases are updated using the approximate steep- est descent rule:  Wm k  1+   Wm k  sm am 1–  =  –    T  ,  bm k  1+    =  bm k  sm  –  .   11.46    11.47   To illustrate the backpropagation algorithm, let’s choose a network and ap- ply it to a particular problem. To begin, we will use the 1-2-1 network that  we discussed earlier in this chapter. For convenience we have reproduced  the network in Figure 11.8.   Next we want to define a problem for the network to solve. Suppose that we  want to use the network to approximate the function  g p   =  1  sin+   for   2–     p  2  .   11.48      ---p  4  To obtain our training set we will evaluate this function at several values  of   .   p  Input  Log-Sigmoid Layer  Linear Layer  p  w11,1  w12,1  b11   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n11  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n12  cid:0  cid:0   b12  1   cid:0  cid:0  a11  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a12  cid:0  cid:0   1  w21,1   cid:0  cid:0 Σ n2  cid:0  cid:0  w21,2  b2   cid:0   cid:0   1  a2  a1 = logsig  W1p + b1   a2 = purelin  W2a1 + b2   Figure 11.8  Example Function Approximation Network  Before we begin the backpropagation algorithm we need to choose some ini- tial values for the network weights and biases. Generally these are chosen  to be small random values. In the next chapter we will discuss some rea- sons for this. For now let’s choose the values  11-14   W1 0   =  – –  0.27 0.41  ,   b1 0   =  – –  0.48 0.13  ,   W2 0   =  0.09 0.17  –  ,   b2 0   =  0.48  .  The response of the network for these initial values is illustrated in Figure  11.9, along with the sine function we wish to approximate.

For the second layer we have  f·2 n   =  d n  nd  =  1  .  We can now perform the backpropagation. The starting point is found at  the second layer, using Eq.  11.44 :  s2  =  2F· 2 n2   –    t a–    =  2 f·2 n2  –     1.261    =  –  2 1 1.261      =  –  2.522  .  The first layer sensitivity is then computed by backpropagating the sensi- tivity from the second layer, using Eq.  11.45 :  s1  =  F· 1 n1     W2   Ts2  =  1  a1    1– 1 a1 0  0 1– 1 a2  1  a2    0.09 – 0.17  –  2.522  – 1  =  0.321 0   0.321     0 – 1 0.368   0.368     0.09 0.17 –  –  2.522  =  0.218  0  0  0.233  0.227 – 0.429  =  0.0495 – 0.0997   .  The final stage of the algorithm is to update the weights. For simplicity, we  will use a learning rate  .  In Chapter 12 the choice of learning rate  will be discussed in more detail.

This completes the first iteration of the backpropagation algorithm. We  next proceed to randomly choose another input from the training set and  perform another iteration of the algorithm. We continue to iterate until the  difference between the network response and the target function reaches  some acceptable level.  Note that this will generally take many passes  through the entire training set.  We will discuss convergence criteria in  more detail in Chapter 12.

Incremental Training  Batch Training  Batch vs. Incremental Training  The algorithm described above is the stochastic gradient descent algo- rithm, which involves “on-line” or incremental training, in which the net- work weights and biases are updated after each input is presented  as with  the LMS algorithm of Chapter 10 . It is also possible to perform batch train- ing, in which the complete gradient is computed  after all inputs are ap- plied to the network  before the weights and biases are updated. For  example, if each input occurs with equal probability, the mean square error  performance index can be written  F x  E eTe   =    =  E t  a–    T t  a–     =    tq  aq–  T tq    aq–    .   11.49   Q    1 ---- Q  q  1=  The total gradient of this performance index is  11-17  11   11 Backpropagation  F x   =    tq  aq–  T tq    aq–    =   tq aq–      T tq aq–        .  11.50   Q    1 ----   Q  q  1=      Q    1 ---- Q  q  1=  Therefore, the total gradient of the mean square error is the mean of the  gradients of the individual squared errors. Therefore, to implement a batch  version of the backpropagation algorithm, we would step through Eq.   11.41  through Eq.  11.45  for all of the inputs in the training set. Then,  the individual gradients would be averaged to get the total gradient. The  update equations for the batch steepest descent algorithm would then be  Wm k  1+  Q   Wm k   ---- – = Q  q  1=  m 1–  m aq sq   T  ,  bm k  1+    =  Q  bm k   ---- – Q  m sq  .  q  1=   11.51    11.52   Using Backpropagation  In this section we will present some issues relating to the practical imple- mentation of backpropagation. We will discuss the choice of network archi- tecture, and problems with network convergence and generalization.  We  will discuss implementation issues again in Chapter 12, which investigates  procedures for improving the algorithm.   Choice of Network Architecture As we discussed earlier in this chapter, multilayer networks can be used to  approximate almost any function, if we have enough neurons in the hidden  layers. However, we cannot say, in general, how many layers or how many  neurons are necessary for adequate performance. In this section we want  to use a few examples to provide some insight into this problem.  2 2+  For our first example let’s assume that we want to approximate the follow- ing functions:  g p   =  1  sin+   for   2–     p  2  ,   11.53      i  -----p  4  i   takes on the values 1, 2, 4 and 8.

Recall from our example on page 11-5 that this type of  two-layer network can produce a response that is a sum of three log-sig- moid functions  or as many log-sigmoids as there are neurons in the hidden  layer . Clearly there is a limit to how complex a function this network can  implement.

Convergence In the previous section we presented some examples in which the network  response did not give an accurate approximation to the desired function,  even though the backpropagation algorithm produced network parameters  that minimized mean square error. This occurred because the capabilities  of the network were inherently limited by the number of hidden neurons it  contained. In this section we will provide an example in which the network  is capable of approximating the function, but the learning algorithm does  not produce network parameters that produce an accurate approximation.  In the next chapter we will discuss this problem in more detail and explain  why it occurs. For now we simply want to illustrate the problem.  11-20   Using Backpropagation  2 2+  The function that we want the network to approximate is  g p   =  1  sin+  p     for   2–     p  2  .   11.55   To approximate this function we will use a 1-3-1 network, where the trans- fer function for the first layer is log-sigmoid and the transfer function for  the second layer is linear.  Figure 11.12 illustrates a case where the learning algorithm converges to  a solution that minimizes mean square error. The thin blue lines represent  intermediate iterations, and the thick blue line represents the final solu- tion, when the algorithm has converged.  The numbers next to each curve  indicate the sequence of iterations, where 0 represents the initial condition  and 5 represents the final solution. The numbers do not correspond to the  iteration number. There were many iterations for which no curve is repre- sented. The numbers simply indicate an ordering.   5  0  1  2  3  4  3  2  1  0  -1 -2  -1  0  1  2  Figure 11.12  Convergence to a Global Minimum  Figure 11.13 illustrates a case where the learning algorithm converges to  a solution that does not minimize mean square error. The thick blue line   marked with a 5  represents the network response at the final iteration.  The gradient of the mean square error is zero at the final iteration, there- fore we have a local minima, but we know that a better solution exists, as  evidenced by Figure 11.12. The only difference between this result and the  result shown in Figure 11.12 is the initial condition. From one initial con- dition the algorithm converged to a global minimum point, while from an- other initial condition the algorithm converged to a local minimum point.  11-21  11   11 Backpropagation  3  2  1  0  -1 -2  3  2  1  5  4  0  -1  0  1  2  Figure 11.13  Convergence to a Local Minimum  Note that this result could not have occurred with the LMS algorithm. The  mean square error performance index for the ADALINE network is a qua- dratic function with a single minimum point  under most conditions .  Therefore the LMS algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global min- imum as long as the learning rate is small enough. The mean square error  for the multilayer network is generally much more complex and has many  local minima  as we will see in the next chapter . When the backpropaga- tion algorithm converges we cannot be sure that we have an optimum so- lution. It is best to try several different initial conditions in order to ensure  that an optimum solution has been obtained.  Generalization In most cases the multilayer network is trained with a finite number of ex- amples of proper network behavior:  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ  {  ,      }  .   11.56   This training set is normally representative of a much larger class of pos- sible input output pairs. It is important that the network successfully gen- eralize what it has learned to the total population.  2 2+  For example, suppose that the training set is obtained by sampling the fol- lowing function:  g p   =  1  sin+     ---p  4  ,   11.57   at the points  .  There are a total of 11 input tar- get pairs.

The 1-2-1 network has only 7 param-  11  11-23   11 Backpropagation  eters and is therefore much more restricted in the types of functions that it  can implement.   For a network to be able to generalize, it should have fewer parameters than  there are data points in the training set. In neural networks, as in all mod- eling problems, we want to use the simplest network that can adequately  represent the training set. Don’t use a bigger network when a smaller net- work will work  a concept often referred to as Ockham’s Razor .   An alternative to using the simplest network is to stop the training before  the network overfits. A reference to this procedure and other techniques to  improve generalization are given in Chapter 13.

Weight Update  Approximate Steepest Descent   11-26   Solved Problems  Solved Problems  P11.1 Consider the two classes of patterns that are shown in Figure   P11.1. Class I represents vertical lines and Class II represents hor- izontal lines.  Class I  Class II  Figure P11.1  Pattern Classes for Problem P11.1  i. Are these categories linearly separable?  ii. Design a multilayer network to distinguish these categories.  i. Let’s begin by converting the patterns to vectors by scanning each 2X2  grid one column at a time. Each white square will be represented by a “-1”  and each blue square by a “1”. The vertical lines  Class I patterns  then be- come  and the horizontal lines  Class II patterns  become  p1  =   and   p2  =  p3  =   and   p4  =  1 1 1– 1–  1 1– 1 1–  ,  .  1– 1– 1 1  1– 1 1– 1  In order for these categories to be linearly separable we must be able to  place a hyperplane between the two categories. This means there must be  a weight matrix    and a bias    such that  b  W  Wp1  b+  0 Wp2  ,   b+  0 Wp3  ,   b+  0 Wp4  ,   b+  0  .

The first two conditions reduce to  w1 1  +  w1 2    w1 3  +  w1 4   and   w1 3  +  w1 4    w1 1  +  w1 2  ,  which are contradictory.

Therefore there is no hyperplane that can  separate these two categories.  ii. There are many different multilayer networks that could solve this prob- lem. We will design a network by first noting that for the Class I vectors  either the first two elements or the last two elements will be “1”. The Class  II vectors have alternating “1” and “-1” patterns. This leads to the network  shown in Figure P11.2.

If they are both “1” it outputs a “1”, otherwise it outputs a “-1”. The  second neuron in the first layer tests the last two elements of the input vec- tor in the same way. Both of the neurons in the first layer perform AND op- erations. The second layer of the network tests whether either of the  outputs of the first layer are “1”. It performs an OR operation. In this way,  the network will output a “1” if either the first two elements or the last two  elements of the input vector are both “1”.  P11.2 Figure P11.3 illustrates a classification problem, where Class I vec- tors are represented by light circles, and Class II vectors are rep- resented by dark circles. These categories are not linearly  separable. Design a multilayer network to correctly classify these  categories.  Figure P11.3  Classification Problem  We will solve this problem with a procedure that can be used for arbitrary  classification problems. It requires a three-layer network, with hard-limit- ing neurons in each layer. In the first layer we create a set of linear decision  boundaries that separate every Class I vector from every Class II vector.  For this problem we used 11 such boundaries. They are shown in Figure  P11.4.  2  1  3  4  5  6  7  10  8  9  11  Figure P11.4  First Layer Decision Boundaries  Each row of the weight matrix in the first layer corresponds to one decision  boundary. The weight matrix and bias vector for the first layer are    W1  T  =  1 1– 1 1–  1 1– 1–  1 1–  1 1–  1 1–  1 1–  1– 1 1 1 1– 1 1  ,  11-29  11   11 Backpropagation  b1  T  =  2– 3 0.5 0.5 1.75  –  2.25 3.25  –  3.75 6.25 5.75  –  –  4.75  .   Review Chapters 3, 4 and 10 for procedures for calculating the appropriate  weight matrix and bias for a given decision boundary.  Now we can com- bine the outputs of the 11 first layer neurons into groups with a second lay- er of AND neurons, such as those we used in the first layer of the network  in Problem P11.1. The second layer weight matrix and bias are  W2  =  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1  ,   bT  =  .  3– 3– 3– 3–  The four decision boundaries for the second layer are shown in Figure  P11.5. For example, the neuron 2 decision boundary is obtained by combin- ing the boundaries 5, 6, 9 and 11 from layer 1. This can be seen by looking  at row 2 of   .  W2  2  1  3  4  Figure P11.5  Second Layer Decision Regions  In the third layer of the network we will combine together the four decision  regions of the second layer into one decision region using an OR operation,  just as in the last layer of the network in Problem P11.1. The weight matrix  and bias for the third layer are  W3  =  1 1 1 1  ,   b3  3=  .  The complete network is shown in Figure P11.6.  The procedure that we used to develop this network can be used to solve  classification problems with arbitrary decision boundaries as long as we  have enough neurons in the hidden layers. The idea is to use the first layer  to create a number of linear boundaries, which can be combined by using  AND neurons in the second layer and OR neurons in the third layer. The  decision regions of the second layer are convex, but the final decision  boundaries created by the third layer can have arbitrary shapes.  11-30   Solved Problems  Input  Initial Decisions  AND Operations  OR Operation  p 2 x 1  1  11 x 2   cid:0 W1  cid:0   cid:0  b1  cid:0  11 x 1  2   cid:0  cid:0  a1 11 x 1 n1  cid:0  cid:0  11 x 1 1  cid:0  cid:0   4 x 11   cid:0  cid:0 W2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   b2 4 x 1  11   cid:0  cid:0 W3  cid:0  cid:0  a2 4 x 1 n2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  4 x 1 1  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   b3 1 x 1  1 x 4  4   cid:0  cid:0  a3 1 x 1 n3  cid:0  cid:0  1 x 1  cid:0  cid:0   1  a1 = hardlims  W1p + b1   a2 = hardlims  W2a1 + b2   a3 = hardlims  W3a2 + b3   Figure P11.6  Network for Problem P11.2  The final network decision regions are given in Figure P11.7. Any vector in  the shaded areas will produce a network output of 1, which corresponds to  Class II. All other vectors will produce a network output of -1, which cor- responds to Class I.

This is identical to the LMS algorithm of Chapter 10.  11-40   Epilogue  Epilogue  In this chapter we have presented the multilayer perceptron network and  the backpropagation learning rule. The multilayer network is a powerful  extension of the single-layer perceptron network. Whereas the single-layer  network is only able to classify linearly separable patterns, the multilayer  network can be used for arbitrary classification problems. In addition, mul- tilayer networks can be used as universal function approximators. It has  been shown that a two-layer network, with sigmoid-type transfer functions  in the hidden layer, can approximate any practical function, given enough  neurons in the hidden layer.  The backpropagation algorithm is an extension of the LMS algorithm that  can be used to train multilayer networks. Both LMS and backpropagation  are approximate steepest descent algorithms that minimize squared error.  The only difference between them is in the way in which the gradient is cal- culated. The backpropagation algorithm uses the chain rule in order to  compute the derivatives of the squared error with respect to the weights  and biases in the hidden layers. It is called backpropagation because the  derivatives are computed first at the last layer of the network, and then  propagated backward through the network, using the chain rule, to com- pute the derivatives in the hidden layers.   One of the major problems with backpropagation has been the long train- ing times. It is not feasible to use the basic backpropagation algorithm on  practical problems, because it can take weeks to train a network, even on  a large computer. Since backpropagation was first popularized, there has  been considerable work on methods to accelerate the convergence of the al- gorithm. In Chapter 12 we will discuss the reasons for the slow conver- gence of backpropagation and will present several techniques for  improving the performance of the algorithm.  Another key problem in training multilayer networks is overfitting. The  network may memorize the data in the training set, but fail to generalize  to new situations. In Chapter 13 we will describe in detail training proce- dures that can be used to produce networks with excellent generalization.  This chapter has focused mainly on the theoretical development of the  backpropagation learning rule for training multilayer networks. Practical  aspects of training networks with this method are discussed in Chapter 22.  Real-world case studies that demonstrate how to train and validate multi- layer networks are provided in Chapter 23  function approximation , Chap- ter 24  probability estimation  and Chapter 25  pattern recognition .  11-41  11   11 Backpropagation  Further Reading  [HoSt89]  K.

However, the basic algorithm is  too slow for most practical applications. In this chapter we present several  variations of backpropagation that provide significant speedup and make  the algorithm more practical.  We will begin by using a function approximation example to illustrate why  the backpropagation algorithm is slow in converging. Then we will present  several modifications to the algorithm. Recall that backpropagation is an  approximate steepest descent algorithm. In Chapter 9 we saw that steepest  descent is the simplest, and often the slowest, minimization method. The  conjugate gradient algorithm and Newton’s method generally provide fast- er convergence. In this chapter we will explain how these faster procedures  can be used to speed up the convergence of backpropagation.  12-1  Objectives   12 Variations on Backpropagation  Theory and Examples  When the basic backpropagation algorithm is applied to a practical prob- lem the training may take days or weeks of computer time. This has en- couraged considerable research on methods to accelerate the convergence  of the algorithm.  The research on faster algorithms falls roughly into two categories. The  first category involves the development of heuristic techniques, which arise  out of a study of the distinctive performance of the standard backpropaga- tion algorithm. These heuristic techniques include such ideas as varying  the learning rate, using momentum and rescaling variables  e.g.,  [VoMa88], [Jacob88], [Toll90] and [RiIr90] . In this chapter we will discuss  the use of momentum and variable learning rates.  Another category of research has focused on standard numerical optimiza- tion techniques  e.g., [Shan90], [Barn92], [Batt92] and [Char92] . As we  have discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, training feedforward neural net- works to minimize squared error is simply a numerical optimization prob- lem. Because numerical optimization has been an important research  subject for 30 or 40 years  see Chapter 9 , it seems reasonable to look for  fast training algorithms in the large number of existing numerical optimi- zation techniques. There is no need to “reinvent the wheel” unless absolute- ly necessary. In this chapter we will present two existing numerical  optimization techniques that have been very successfully applied to the  training of multilayer perceptrons: the conjugate gradient algorithm and  the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm  a variation of Newton’s method .  We should emphasize that all of the algorithms that we will describe in this  chapter use the backpropagation procedure, in which derivatives are pro- cessed from the last layer of the network to the first. For this reason they  could all be called “backpropagation” algorithms. The differences between  the algorithms occur in the way in which the resulting derivatives are used  to update the weights. In some ways it is unfortunate that the algorithm  we usually refer to as backpropagation is in fact a steepest descent algo- rithm. In order to clarify our discussion, for the remainder of this chapter  we will refer to the basic backpropagation algorithm as steepest descent  backpropagation  SDBP .  In the next section we will use a simple example to explain why SDBP has  problems with convergence. Then, in the following sections, we will present  various procedures to improve the convergence of the algorithm.  SDBP  12-2   Drawbacks of Backpropagation  Drawbacks of Backpropagation  12  Recall from Chapter 10 that the LMS algorithm is guaranteed to converge  to a solution that minimizes the mean squared error, so long as the learn- ing rate is not too large. This is true because the mean squared error for a  single-layer linear network is a quadratic function. The quadratic function  has only a single stationary point. In addition, the Hessian matrix of a qua- dratic function is constant, therefore the curvature of the function in a giv- en direction does not change, and the function contours are elliptical.  SDBP is a generalization of the LMS algorithm. Like LMS, it is also an ap- proximate steepest descent algorithm for minimizing the mean squared er- ror. In fact, SDBP is equivalent to the LMS algorithm when used on a  single-layer linear network.  See Problem P11.10.  When applied to multi- layer networks, however, the characteristics of SDBP are quite different.  This has to do with the differences between the mean squared error perfor- mance surfaces of single-layer linear networks and multilayer nonlinear  networks. While the performance surface for a single-layer linear network  has a single minimum point and constant curvature, the performance sur- face for a multilayer network may have many local minimum points, and  the curvature can vary widely in different regions of the parameter space.  This will become clear in the example that follows.  Performance Surface Example To investigate the mean squared error performance surface for multilayer  networks we will employ a simple function approximation example. We will  use the 1-2-1 network shown in Figure 12.1, with log-sigmoid transfer func- tions in both layers.

The approximation will be exact when the net- work parameters are set to the values given in Eq.  12.1  and Eq.  12.2 .  This is, of course, a very contrived problem, but it is simple and it illus- trates some important concepts.  Let’s now consider the performance index for our problem. We will assume  that the function is sampled at the values  p  =  2–    1.9–    1.8–   1.9 2        ,   12.3   and that each occurs with equal probability. The performance index will be  the sum of the squared errors at these 41 points.  We won’t bother to find  the mean squared error, which just requires dividing by 41.   2  1   and   In order to be able to graph the performance index, we will vary only two  parameters at a time. Figure 12.3 illustrates the squared error when only  w1 1 their optimal values given in Eq.  12.1  and Eq.  12.2 . Note that the mini- mum error will be zero, and it will occur when  , as  indicated by the open blue circle in the figure.   are being adjusted, while the other parameters are set to    and   w1 1  10=  w1 1  w1 1  1=  1  2   12  Drawbacks of Backpropagation  There are several features to notice about this error surface. First, it is  clearly not a quadratic function. The curvature varies drastically over the  parameter space. For this reason it will be difficult to choose an appropri- ate learning rate for the steepest descent algorithm. In some regions the  surface is very flat, which would allow a large learning rate, while in other  regions the curvature is high, which would require a small learning rate.   Refer to discussions in Chapters 9 and 10 on the choice of learning rate for  the steepest descent algorithm.   It should be noted that the flat regions of the performance surface should  not be unexpected, given the sigmoid transfer functions used by the net- work. The sigmoid is very flat for large inputs.  2  1=  , along the valley that runs parallel to the   A second feature of this error surface is the existence of more than one local  minimum point.

Here we see that there are two local minimum  points and they both have the same value of squared error. The second so- lution corresponds to the same network being turned upside down  i.e., the  top neuron in the first layer is exchanged with the bottom neuron . It is be- cause of this characteristic of neural networks that we do not set the initial  weights and biases to zero. The symmetry causes zero to be a saddle point  of the performance surface.  This brief study of the performance surfaces for multilayer networks gives  us some hints as to how to set the initial guess for the SDBP algorithm.  First, we do not want to set the initial parameters to zero. This is because  the origin of the parameter space tends to be a saddle point for the perfor- mance surface. Second, we do not want to set the initial parameters to large  values. This is because the performance surface tends to have very flat re- gions as we move far away from the optimum point.  Typically we choose the initial weights and biases to be small random val- ues. In this way we stay away from a possible saddle point at the origin  without moving out to the very flat regions of the performance surface.  An- other procedure for choosing the initial parameters is described in  [NgWi90].  As we will see in the next section, it is also useful to try several  different initial guesses, in order to be sure that the algorithm converges to  a global minimum point.  12-6   Batching  Drawbacks of Backpropagation  12  10  5  -5  2 b1  0  1.4  0.7  0 -10  -10  -10  -5  5  10  0 1 b1  -5  0  1 b1  5  5  10  10  -10  -5  0  1 b2  Figure 12.5  Squared Error Surface Versus   1 b1   and   1 b2  Convergence Example Now that we have examined the performance surface, let’s investigate the  performance of SDBP. For this section we will use a variation of the stan- dard algorithm, called batching, in which the parameters are updated only  after the entire training set has been presented. The gradients calculated  at each training example are averaged together to produce a more accurate  estimate of the gradient.  If the training set is complete, i.e., covers all pos- sible input output pairs, then the gradient estimate will be exact.   1  2  w1 1  w1 1   and   In Figure 12.6 we see two trajectories of SDBP  batch mode  when only two  parameters,   are adjusted. For the initial condition labeled  “a” the algorithm does eventually converge to the optimal solution, but the  convergence is slow. The reason for the slow convergence is the change in  curvature of the surface over the path of the trajectory. After an initial  moderate slope, the trajectory passes over a very flat surface, until it falls  into a very gently sloping valley. If we were to increase the learning rate,  the algorithm would converge faster while passing over the initial flat sur- face, but would become unstable when falling into the valley, as we will see  in a moment.  1  2  =  =  ,   0.88  38.6  w1 1  Trajectory “b” illustrates how the algorithm can converge to a local mini- mum point. The trajectory is trapped in a valley and diverges from the op- timal solution. If allowed to continue the trajectory converges to  . The existence of multiple local minimum points  w1 1 is typical of the performance surface of multilayer networks. For this rea- son it is best to try several different initial guesses in order to ensure that  a global minimum has been obtained.  Some of the local minimum points  may have the same value of squared error, as we saw in Figure 12.5, so we  would not expect the algorithm to converge to the same parameter values  for each initial guess. We just want to be sure that the same minimum error  is obtained.   12-7   12 Variations on Backpropagation  2 w1 1  5  15  b  10  0  -5 -5  a  12-8  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  Figure 12.6  Two SDBP  Batch Mode  Trajectories   The progress of the algorithm can also be seen in Figure 12.7, which shows  the squared error versus the iteration number. The curve on the left corre- sponds to trajectory “a” and the curve on the right corresponds to trajectory  “b.” These curves are typical of SDBP, with long periods of little progress  and then short periods of rapid advance.  a  b  1.5  2  1  0.5  0 100  6  4  2  0 100  102  Iteration Number  104  101 102 Iteration Number  103  Figure 12.7  Squared Error Convergence Patterns  We can see that the flat sections in Figure 12.7 correspond to times when  the algorithm is traversing a flat section of the performance surface, as  shown in Figure 12.6. During these periods we would like to increase the  learning rate, in order to speed up convergence. However, if we increase the  learning rate the algorithm will become unstable when it reaches steeper  portions of the performance surface.  This effect is illustrated in Figure 12.8. The trajectory shown here corre- sponds to trajectory “a” in Figure 12.6, except that a larger learning rate  was used. The algorithm converges faster at first, but when the trajectory  reaches the narrow valley that contains the minimum point the algorithm  begins to diverge. This suggests that it would be useful to vary the learning  rate. We could increase the learning rate on flat surfaces and then decrease  the learning rate as the slope increased. The question is: “How will the al-   Heuristic Modifications of Backpropagation  gorithm know when it is on a flat surface?” We will discuss this in a later  section.  12  2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  Squared Error  1.5  1  0.5  0 100  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  101 102 Iteration Number  103  Figure 12.8  Trajectory with Learning Rate Too Large  Another way to improve convergence would be to smooth out the trajectory.  Note in Figure 12.8 that when the algorithm begins to diverge it is oscillat- ing back and forth across a narrow valley. If we could filter the trajectory,  by averaging the updates to the parameters, this might smooth out the os- cillations and produce a stable trajectory. We will discuss this procedure in  the next section.  To experiment with this backpropagation example, use the MATLAB® Neu- ral Network Design Demonstration Steepest Descent Backpropagation   nnd12sd .  Heuristic Modifications of Backpropagation  Now that we have investigated some of the drawbacks of backpropagation   steepest descent , let’s consider some procedures for improving the algo- rithm. In this section we will discuss two heuristic methods. In a later sec- tion we will present two methods based on standard numerical optimiza- tion algorithms.  Momentum The first method we will discuss is the use of momentum. This is a modifi- cation based on our observation in the last section that convergence might  be improved if we could smooth out the oscillations in the trajectory. We  can do this with a low-pass filter.  Before we apply momentum to a neural network application, let’s investi- gate a simple example to illustrate the smoothing effect. Consider the fol- lowing first-order filter:  12-9   12 Variations on Backpropagation  y k   =  y k  1–    +  – 1  w k   ,   12.4   w k   where  is the momentum coefficient that must satisfy   is the input to the filter,   y k    is the output of the filter and        The effect of this filter is shown in Figure 12.9. For these examples the in- put to the filter was taken to be the sine wave:  0    1  .  w k   =  1  sin+     2k  ---------  16  ,   12.5    12.6     and the momentum coefficient was set to    0.98  right graph . Here we can see that the oscillation of the filter output is less  than the oscillation in the filter input  as we would expect for a low-pass  filter . In addition, as   is increased the oscillation in the filter output is  reduced. Notice also that the average filter output is the same as the aver- age filter input, although as   is increased the filter output is slower to re- spond.     left graph  and   0.9  =  =        1.5  2  1  0.5  0 0  1.5  2  1  0.5  50  a    100 =  0.9  150  200  0 0  50  b    100 =  0.98  150  200  Figure 12.9  Smoothing Effect of Momentum  To summarize, the filter tends to reduce the amount of oscillation, while  still tracking the average value. Now let’s see how this works on the neural  network problem. First, recall that the parameter updates for SDBP  Eq.   11.46  and Eq.  11.47   are  Wm k   –=  sm am 1–    T  ,  bm k   –=  sm  .   12.7    12.8   12-10   Heuristic Modifications of Backpropagation  Momentum  MOBP  When the momentum filter is added to the parameter changes, we obtain  the following equations for the momentum modification to backpropaga- tion  MOBP :  12  Wm k   =  Wm k  1–    –  – 1  sm am 1–    T  ,  bm k   =  bm k  1–    –  – 1  sm  .   12.9    12.10   If we now apply these modified equations to the example in the preceding  section, we obtain the results shown in Figure 12.10.  For this example we  have used a batching form of MOBP, in which the parameters are updated  only after the entire training set has been presented. The gradients calcu- lated at each training example are averaged together to produce a more ac- curate estimate of the gradient.  This trajectory corresponds to the same  initial condition and learning rate shown in Figure 12.8, but with a momen- tum coefficient of  . We can see that the algorithm is now stable. By  the use of momentum we have been able to use a larger learning rate, while  maintaining the stability of the algorithm. Another feature of momentum  is that it tends to accelerate convergence when the trajectory is moving in  a consistent direction.  0.8  =    2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  Squared Error  1.5  1  0.5  0 100  101 102 Iteration Number  103  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  Figure 12.10  Trajectory with Momentum  If you look carefully at the trajectory in Figure 12.10, you can see why the  procedure is given the name momentum. It tends to make the trajectory  continue in the same direction. The larger the value of  , the more “mo- mentum” the trajectory has.    To experiment with momentum, use the MATLAB® Neural Network Design  Demonstration Momentum Backpropagation  nnd12mo .  12-11   Variable Learning Rate VLBP  12 Variations on Backpropagation  Variable Learning Rate We suggested earlier in this chapter that we might be able to speed up con- vergence if we increase the learning rate on flat surfaces and then decrease  the learning rate when the slope increases. In this section we want to ex- plore this concept.  Recall that the mean squared error performance surface for single-layer  linear networks is always a quadratic function, and the Hessian matrix is  therefore constant. The maximum stable learning rate for the steepest de- scent algorithm is two divided by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian  matrix.  See Eq.  9.25 .   As we have seen, the error surface for the multilayer network is not a qua- dratic function. The shape of the surface can be very different in different  regions of the parameter space. Perhaps we can speed up convergence by  adjusting the learning rate during the course of training. The trick will be  to determine when to change the learning rate and by how much.  There are many different approaches for varying the learning rate. We will  describe a very straightforward batching procedure [VoMa88], where the  learning rate is varied according to the performance of the algorithm. The  rules of the variable learning rate backpropagation algorithm  VLBP  are:  1.  2.  3.  If the squared error  over the entire training set  increases by more  than some set percentage  weight update, then the weight update is discarded, the learning rate  is multiplied by some factor      if it is used  is set to zero.     typically one to five percent  after a   , and the momentum coefficient   0  1       If the squared error decreases after a weight update, then the weight  update is accepted and the learning rate is multiplied by some factor   has been previously set to zero, it is reset to its original val-  1 ue.  .

To illustrate VLBP, let’s apply it to the function approximation problem of  the previous section. Figure 12.11 displays the trajectory for the algorithm  using the same initial guess, initial learning rate and momentum coeffi- cient as was used in Figure 12.10. The new parameters were assigned the  values    =  1.05  ,     =  0.7   and     4%=  .   12.11   12-12   Heuristic Modifications of Backpropagation  12  2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  12-13  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  Figure 12.11  Variable Learning Rate Trajectory  Notice how the learning rate, and therefore the step size, tends to increase  when the trajectory is traveling in a straight line with constantly decreas- ing error. This effect can also be seen in Figure 12.12, which shows the  squared error and the learning rate versus iteration number.   When the trajectory reaches a narrow valley, the learning rate is rapidly  decreased. Otherwise the trajectory would have become oscillatory, and the  error would have increased dramatically. For each potential step where the  error would have increased by more than 4% the learning rate is reduced  and the momentum is eliminated, which allows the trajectory to make the  quick turn to follow the valley toward the minimum point. The learning  rate then increases again, which accelerates the convergence. The learning  rate is reduced again when the trajectory overshoots the minimum point  when the algorithm has almost converged. This process is typical of a  VLBP trajectory.

Jacobs  [Jaco88] proposed the delta-bar-delta learning rule, in which each network  parameter  weight or bias  has its own learning rate. The algorithm in- creases the learning rate for a network parameter if the parameter change    12 Variations on Backpropagation  has been in the same direction for several iterations. If the direction of the  parameter change alternates, then the learning rate is reduced. The Su- perSAB algorithm of Tollenaere [Toll90] is similar to the delta-bar-delta  rule, but it has more complex rules for adjusting the learning rates.  Another heuristic modification to SDBP is the Quickprop algorithm of  Fahlman [Fahl88]. It assumes that the error surface is parabolic and con- cave upward around the minimum point and that the effect of each weight  can be considered independently.    ,       and   The heuristic modifications to SDBP can often provide much faster conver- gence for some problems. However, there are two main drawbacks to these  methods. The first is that the modifications require that several parame- ters be set  e.g.,   , while the only parameter required for SDBP  is the learning rate. Some of the more complex heuristic modifications can  have five or six parameters to be selected. Often the performance of the al- gorithm is sensitive to changes in these parameters. The choice of param- eters is also problem dependent. The second drawback to these  modifications to SDBP is that they can sometimes fail to converge on prob- lems for which SDBP will eventually find a solution. Both of these draw- backs tend to occur more often when using the more complex algorithms.  To experiment with VLBP, use the MATLAB® Neural Network Design Dem- onstration Variable Learning Rate Backpropagation  nnd12vl .  Now that we have investigated some of the heuristic modifications to  SDBP, let’s consider those methods that are based on standard numerical  optimization techniques. We will investigate two techniques: conjugate  gradient and Levenberg-Marquardt. The conjugate gradient algorithm for  quadratic functions was presented in Chapter 9. We need to add two proce- dures to this algorithm in order to apply it to more general functions.  The second numerical optimization method we will discuss in this chapter  is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which is a modification to New- ton’s method that is well-suited to neural network training.  Conjugate Gradient In Chapter 9 we presented three numerical optimization techniques: steep- est descent, conjugate gradient and Newton’s method. Steepest descent is  the simplest algorithm, but is often slow in converging. Newton’s method  is much faster, but requires that the Hessian matrix and its inverse be cal- culated. The conjugate gradient algorithm is something of a compromise; it  does not require the calculation of second derivatives, and yet it still has  the quadratic convergence property.  It converges to the minimum of a qua- dratic function in a finite number of iterations.  In this section we will de- scribe how the conjugate gradient algorithm can be used to train   12-14  Numerical Optimization Techniques   Numerical Optimization Techniques  CGBP  multilayer networks. We will call this algorithm conjugate gradient back- propagation  CGBP .  Let’s begin by reviewing the conjugate gradient algorithm. For ease of ref- erence, we will repeat the algorithm steps from Chapter 9  page 9-18 :  1.

Select the next search direction according to Eq.  9.60 , using Eq.    9.61 , Eq.  9.62 , or Eq.  9.63  to calculate   k  :  where  with   12.12    12.13   k   to    12.14    12.15    12.16   k  =  T gk gk 1– --------------------------- T pk gk 1–  1–   or   k  =   or   k  =  Tgk gk gk  ----------------------- T gk 1–  1–  T gk gk ----------------------- T gk 1–  1– gk  1–  .  4.  If the algorithm has not converged, continue from step 2.  This conjugate gradient algorithm cannot be applied directly to the neural  network training task, because the performance index is not quadratic.  This affects the algorithm in two ways. First, we will not be able to use Eq.   9.31  to minimize the function along a line, as required in step 2. Second,  the exact minimum will not normally be reached in a finite number of  steps, and therefore the algorithm will need to be reset after some set num- ber of iterations.  Let’s address the linear search first. We need to have a general procedure  for locating the minimum of a function in a specified direction. This will in- volve two steps: interval location and interval reduction. The purpose of the  interval location step is to find some initial interval that contains a local  minimum. The interval reduction step then reduces the size of the initial  interval until the minimum is located to the desired accuracy.  12-15   12 Variations on Backpropagation  Interval Location  We will use a function comparison method [Scal85] to perform the interval  location step. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 12.13. We begin by  evaluating the performance index at an initial point, represented by  a1 the figure. This point corresponds to the current values of the network  weights and biases. In other words, we are evaluating   in   F x0    .  The next step is to evaluate the function at a second point, represented by   from the initial point, along the first  b1 search direction   . In other words, we are evaluating   in the figure, which is a distance     p0   12.17    12.18   F x   F x0   +  p0    .  4ε  8ε  2ε  ε  a1  b1 a2  b2 a3  a5  b3 a4  x  b4 b5  Interval Reduction  Figure 12.13  Interval Location  We then continue to evaluate the performance index at new points  cessively doubling the distance between points. This process stops when  the function increases between two consecutive evaluations. In Figure  . At this point we know that the mini- 12.13 this is represented by b4 mum is bracketed by the two points  . We cannot narrow the in- a5 terval any further, because the minimum may occur either in the interval  . These two possibilities are illustrated in  [ a4  b4 Figure 12.14  a .   or in the interval   a3  b3 [  , suc-   and    to   b3  b5  bi  ]  ]  ,  ,  Now that we have located an interval containing the minimum, the next  step in the linear search is interval reduction. This will involve evaluating  the function at points inside the interval  , which was selected in the  interval location step. From Figure 12.14 we can see that we will need to  evaluate the function at two internal points  at least  in order to reduce the  size of the interval of uncertainty. Figure 12.14  a  shows that one internal  function evaluation does not provide us with any information on the loca- tion of the minimum. However, if we evaluate the function at two points    c , as in Figure 12.14  b , we can reduce the interval of uncertainty.

There are several ways to do this   The procedure described above suggests a method for reducing the size of  the interval of uncertainty. We now need to decide how to determine the lo- cations of the internal points   see [Scal85] . We will use a method called the Golden Section search,  which is designed to reduce the number of function evaluations required.  At each iteration one new function evaluation is required. For example, in  the case illustrated in Figure 12.14  b , point  a point   would become the new point  . Then point  d .

See Problem P12.4 for a numerical example of the interval location and in- terval reduction procedures.   n  There is one more modification to the conjugate gradient algorithm that  needs to be made before we apply it to neural network training. For qua- dratic functions the algorithm will converge to the minimum in at most  n iterations, where   is the number of parameters being optimized. The  mean squared error performance index for multilayer networks is not qua- dratic, therefore the algorithm would not normally converge in  tions. The development of the conjugate gradient algorithm does not  indicate what search direction to use once a cycle of   iterations has been  completed.

We will use this meth-   itera-  n  n  n     Let’s now apply the conjugate gradient algorithm to the function approxi- mation example that we have been using to demonstrate the other neural  network training algorithms. We will use the backpropagation algorithm to  compute the gradient  using Eq.  11.23  and Eq.  11.24   and the conjugate  gradient algorithm to determine the weight updates. This is a batch mode  algorithm, as the gradient is computed after the entire training set has  been presented to the network.  Figure 12.15 shows the intermediate steps of the CGBP algorithm for the  first three iterations. The interval location process is illustrated by the  open blue circles; each one represents one evaluation of the function. The  final interval is indicated by the larger open black circles. The black dots in  Figure 12.15 indicate the location of the new interior points during the  Golden Section search, one for each iteration of the procedure. The final  point is indicated by a blue dot.  Figure 12.16 shows the total trajectory to convergence. Notice that the  CGBP algorithm converges in many fewer iterations than the other algo- rithms that we have tested. This is a little deceiving, since each iteration of  CGBP requires more computations than the other methods; there are  many function evaluations involved in each iteration of CGBP. Even so,  CGBP has been shown to be one of the fastest batch training algorithms for  multilayer networks [Char92].  12-18   Numerical Optimization Techniques  12  2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  12-19  0  10  15  Figure 12.15  Intermediate Steps of CGBP  Squared Error  5 1 w1 1  1.5  1  0.5  2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  0 100  101  Iteration Number  102  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  Figure 12.16  Conjugate Gradient Trajectory  To experiment with CGBP, use the MATLAB® Neural Network Design  Demonstrations Conjugate Gradient Line Search  nnd12ls  and Conjugate  Gradient Backpropagation  nnd12cg .  Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is a variation of Newton’s method  that was designed for minimizing functions that are sums of squares of oth- er nonlinear functions. This is very well suited to neural network training  where the performance index is the mean squared error.  Basic Algorithm  Let’s begin by considering the form of Newton’s method where the perfor- mance index is a sum of squares. Recall from Chapter 9 that Newton’s  method for optimizing a performance index    is  F x    12 Variations on Backpropagation  xk  1+  =  xk Ak  –  1– gk  ,   12.19   where   Ak    2  F x    and   gk      F x   x xk=  .  x xk=  If we assume that   F x    is a sum of squares function:  F x   =  2 x  vi  =  vT x v x   ,   12.20   N    i  1=  then the jth element of the gradient would be    F x   j  =  =  2  vi x   F x   xj--------------  vi x   xj---------------  .

JTJ One problem with the Gauss-Newton method is that the matrix    may not be invertible. This can be overcome by using the following modifi- cation to the approximate Hessian matrix:  H  =  G  =  H I+  .   12.29   To see how this matrix can be made invertible, suppose that the eigenval- ues and eigenvectors of   .

The performance index for multilay- er network training is the mean squared error  see Eq.  11.11  . If each tar- get occurs with equal probability, the mean squared error is proportional  to the sum of squared errors over the    targets in the training set:  Q  F x   =    tq  aq–  T tq    aq–    Q  q  1= Q    q  1=  =  Teq eq  =    ej q  2  =  vi  2 ,  Q    SM   q  1=  j  1=  N    i  1=   12.34   where   ej q   is the j th element of the error for the q th input target pair.  Eq.  12.34  is equivalent to the performance index, Eq.  12.20 , for which  Levenberg-Marquardt was designed. Therefore it should be a straightfor- ward matter to adapt the algorithm for network training. It turns out that  this is true in concept, but it does require some care in working out the de- tails.  Jacobian Calculation  The key step in the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is the computation of  the Jacobian matrix. To perform this computation we will use a variation  of the backpropagation algorithm. Recall that in the standard backpropa- gation procedure we compute the derivatives of the squared errors, with re- spect to the weights and biases of the network. To create the Jacobian  matrix we need to compute the derivatives of the errors, instead of the de- rivatives of the squared errors.  It is a simple matter conceptually to modify the backpropagation algorithm  to compute the elements of the Jacobian matrix. Unfortunately, although   12-22   12  Numerical Optimization Techniques  the basic concept is simple, the details of the implementation can be a little  tricky. For that reason you may want to skim through the rest of this sec- tion on your first reading, in order to obtain an overview of the general flow  of the presentation, and return later to pick up the details. It may also be  helpful to review the development of the backpropagation algorithm in  Chapter 11 before proceeding.  Before we present the procedure for computing the Jacobian, let’s take a  closer look at its form  Eq.  12.23  . Note that the error vector is  vT  =  v1 v2  vN  =  e1 1  e2 1  e  e1 2  e  SM Q  ,  SM 1   12.35   the parameter vector is  xT  =  x1 x2  xn  =  1 w1 2 w1 1  1  w  1 S1 R  1  b b1  1 w1 1 S1  2  b  M SM  ,  12.36   N  =  Q SM   and   n  =  S1 R 1+    S2 S1    +  1+    SM SM 1– +  +    1+    .   Therefore, if we make these substitutions into Eq.  12.23 , the Jacobian  matrix for multilayer network training can be written  J x   =  .   12.37   e1 1 e1 1 -------------  ------------- 1 1 w1 2 w1 1 e2 1 e2 1 -------------  ------------- 1 1 w1 2 w1 1      e SM 1 -------------- 1 w1 1 e1 2 ------------- 1 w1 1   e SM 1 --------------  1 w1 2 e1 2 -------------  1 w1 2  e1 1 e1 1 ------------  --------------- 1 1 b1 w S1 R e2 1 e2 1 ------------  --------------- 1 1 b1 w S1 R      e SM 1 --------------- 1 w S1 R e1 2 --------------- 1 w S1 R   e SM 1 --------------  1 b1 e1 2 ------------  1 b1            The terms in this Jacobian matrix can be computed by a simple modifica- tion to the backpropagation algorithm.  Standard backpropagation calculates terms like  Fˆ x   xl--------------  =  Teq eq  xl---------------  .   12.38   12-23   Marquardt Sensitivity  The backpropagation process computed the sensitivities through a recur- rence relationship from the last layer backward to the first layer. We can  use the same concept to compute the terms needed for the Jacobian matrix   Eq.  12.37   if we define a new Marquardt sensitivity:  12 Variations on Backpropagation  For the elements of the Jacobian matrix that are needed for the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm we need to calculate terms like  Recall from Eq.  11.18  in our derivation of backpropagation that  where the first term on the right-hand side was defined as the sensitivity:  J h l  =  vh xl-------  =  ek q xl-----------  .

For the Marquardt sensitivities at the final layer we have  12-24   12  Numerical Optimization Techniques  M s˜i h  =  vh ----------- M ni q  =  ek q ----------- M ni q  =  tk q  M–    ak q ------------------------------- M ni q  =  –  M ak q ------------ M ni q  =        f· M ni q M    –  0  for i  k=  for i  k   .  pq  has been applied to the network and the cor- Therefore when the input  M aq responding network output  quardt backpropagation is initialized with   has been computed, the Levenberg-Mar-  M S˜ q  –=  F· M nq M    ,  F· M nM     is defined in Eq.  11.34 .

To illustrate LMBP, let’s apply it to the function approximation problem in- troduced at the beginning of this chapter. We will begin by looking at the  basic Levenberg-Marquardt step.

Of course this al- gorithm also requires more computation per iteration than any of the other  algorithms, since it involves a matrix inversion. Even given the large num- ber of computations, however, the LMBP algorithm appears to be the fast- est neural network training algorithm for moderate numbers of network  parameters [HaMe94].   12  2 w1 1  5  15  10  0  -5 -5  1.5  1  0.5  0 100  Squared Error  101  Iteration Number  102  0  10  15  5 1 w1 1  Figure 12.18  LMBP Trajectory  To experiment with the LMBP algorithm, use the MATLAB® Neural Net- work Design Demonstrations Marquardt Step  nnd12ms  and Marquardt  Backpropagation  nnd12m .  n  The key drawback of the LMBP algorithm is the storage requirement.

The function that is plotted  is the sum of squared errors for the entire training set. Note that the indi- vidual partial gradients can point in quite different directions than the true  gradient. However, on the average, over several iterations, the path will  generally follow the steepest descent trajectory.  12-33   12 Variations on Backpropagation  The relative effectiveness of the batch mode over the incremental approach  depends very much on the particular problem. The incremental approach  requires less storage, and, if the inputs are presented randomly to the net- work, the trajectory is stochastic, which makes the algorithm somewhat  less likely to be trapped in a local minimum. It may also take longer to con- verge than the batch mode algorithm.  1.5  1  0.5  0 -4  b  4  2  0  -2  -4 -4  -2  0  b  2  -4  -2  2  0  w  4  4  Figure P12.2  Effect of Batching in Problem P12.1  -2  2  4  0 w  P12.2 In Chapter 9 we proved that the steepest descent algorithm, when   applied to a quadratic function, would be stable if the learning  rate was less than 2 divided by the maximum eigenvalue of the  Hessian matrix.

It is not feasible to use SDBP on practical problems, because it can  take weeks to train a network, even on a large computer. Since backpropa- gation was first popularized, there has been considerable work on methods  to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. In this chapter we have dis- cussed the reasons for the slow convergence of SDBP and have presented  several techniques for improving the performance of the algorithm.  The techniques for speeding up convergence have fallen into two main cat- egories: heuristic methods and standard numerical optimization methods.  We have discussed two heuristic methods: momentum  MOBP  and vari- able learning rate  VLBP . MOBP is simple to implement, can be used in  batch mode or incremental mode and is significantly faster than SDBP. It  does require the selection of the momentum coefficient, but   is limited to   and the algorithm is not extremely sensitive to this choice. the range   0  1 [ ,    ]  The VLBP algorithm is faster than MOBP but must be used in batch mode.  For this reason it requires more storage. VLBP also requires the selection  of a total of five parameters. The algorithm is reasonably robust, but the  choice of the parameters can affect the convergence speed and is problem  dependent.  We also presented two standard numerical optimization techniques: conju- gate gradient  CGBP  and Levenberg-Marquardt  LMBP . CGBP is gener- ally faster than VLBP. It is a batch mode algorithm, which requires a linear  search at each iteration, but its storage requirements are not significantly  different than VLBP. There are many variations of the conjugate gradient  algorithm proposed for neural network applications. We have presented  only one.  The LMBP algorithm is the fastest algorithm that we have tested for train- ing multilayer networks of moderate size, even though it requires a matrix  inversion at each iteration. It requires that two parameters be selected, but  the algorithm does not appear to be sensitive to this selection. The main  drawback of LMBP is the storage requirement. The   is the total number of weights and bi- must be inverted, is  ases in the network. If the network has more than a few thousand param- eters, the LMBP algorithm becomes impractical on current machines.   matrix, which   , where   JTJ  n  n  n  There are many other variations on backpropagation that have not been  discussed in this chapter.

The QuickProp algorithm, which is described in this paper,  is one of the more popular heuristic modifications to back- propagation. It assumes that the error curve can be approx- imated by a parabola, and that the effect of each weight can  be considered independently. QuickProp provides signifi- cant speedup over standard backpropagation on many  problems.  M. T. Hagan and M.

[NgWi90]  [RiIr90]  This is another early paper discussing the use of variable  learning rate backpropagation.

Widrow, “Improving the learning speed  of 2-layer neural networks by choosing initial values of the  adaptive weights,” Proceedings of the IJCNN, vol. 3, pp.  21–26, July 1990.  This paper describes a procedure for setting the initial  weights and biases for the backpropagation algorithm. It  uses the shape of the sigmoid transfer function and the  range of the input variables to determine how large the  weights should be, and then uses the biases to center the  sigmoids in the operating region. The convergence of back- propagation is improved significantly by this procedure.  A. K. Rigler, J. M. Irvine and T. P. Vogl, “Rescaling of vari- ables in back propagation learning,” Neural Networks, vol.  4, no. 2, pp. 225–230, 1991.  This paper notes that the derivative of a sigmoid function  is very small on the tails. This means that the elements of  the gradient associated with the first few layers will gener- ally be smaller that those associated with the last layer.  The terms in the gradient are then scaled to equalize them.  [Scal85]   L. E. Scales, Introduction to Non-Linear Optimization. New  York: Springer-Verlag, 1985.

In effect, that is the objective of this chapter.  In Chapter 11 we showed that if the number of neurons is too large, the net- work will overfit the training data. This means that the error on the train- ing data will be very small, but the network will fail to perform as well  when presented with new data. A network that generalizes well will per- form as well on new data as it does on the training data.  The complexity of a neural network is determined by the number of free pa- rameters that it has  weights and biases , which in turn is determined by  the number of neurons. If a network is too complex for a given data set,  then it is likely to overfit and to have poor generalization.  In this chapter we will see that we can adjust the complexity of a network  to fit the complexity of the data. In addition, this can be done without  changing the number of neurons. We can adjust the effective number of  free parameters without changing the actual number of free parameters.  13-1   13 Generalization  Theory and Examples  Generalization  Ockham’s Razor  Mark Twain once said “We should be careful to get out of an experience  only the wisdom that is in it-and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits  down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again- and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.”   From Following the Equator, 1897.   That is the objective of this chapter. We want to train neural networks to  get out of the data only the wisdom that is in it. This concept is called gen- eralization. A network trained to generalize will perform as well in new sit- uations as it does on the data on which it was trained.  The key strategy we will use for obtaining good generalization is to find the  simplest model that explains the data. This is a variation of a principle  called Ockham’s razor, which is named after the English logician William  of Ockham, who worked in the 14th Century. The idea is that the more  complexity you have in your model, the greater the possibility for errors.  In terms of neural networks, the simplest model is the one that contains  the smallest number of free parameters  weights and biases , or, equiva- lently, the smallest number of neurons. To find a network that generalizes  well, we need to find the simplest network that fits the data.  There are at least five different approaches that people have used to pro- duce simple networks: growing, pruning, global searches, regularization,  and early stopping. Growing methods start with no neurons in the network  and then add neurons until the performance is adequate. Pruning methods  start with large networks, which likely overfit, and then remove neurons   or weights  one at a time until the performance degrades significantly.  Global searches, such as genetic algorithms, search the space of all possible  network architectures to locate the simplest model that explains the data.  The final two approaches, regularization and early stopping, keep the net- work small by constraining the magnitude of the network weights, rather  than by constraining the number of network weights. In this chapter we  will concentrate on these two approaches. We will begin by defining the  problem of generalization and by showing examples of both good and poor  generalization. We will then describe the regularization and early stopping  methods for training neural networks. Finally, we will demonstrate how  these two methods are, in effect, performing the same operation.  Problem Statement  Let’s begin our discussion of generalization by defining the problem. We  start with a training set of example network inputs and corresponding tar- get outputs:  13-2   Problem Statement  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ  {      ,  }  .

The large open circles represent the noisy target  points. The black curve represents the trained network response, and the  smaller circles filled with crosses represent the network response at the  training points. In this figure we can see that the network response exactly  matches the training points. However, it does a very poor job of matching  the underlying function. It overfits.  There are actually two kinds of errors that occur in Figure 13.1. The first  type of error, which is caused by overfitting, occurs for input values be- tween -3 and 0. This is the region where all of the training data points oc- ccur. The network response in this region overfits the training data and  will fail to perform well for input values that are not in the training set. The  network does a poor job of interpolation; it fails to accurately approximate  the function near the training points.  The second type of error occurs for inputs in the region between 0 and 3.  The network fails to perform well in this region, not because it is overfit- ting, but because there is no training data there. The network is extrapo- lating beyond the range of the input data.  In this chapter we will discuss methods for preventing errors of interpola- tion  overfitting . There is no way to prevent errors of extrapolation, unless  the data that is used to train the network covers all regions of the input  space where the network will be used. The network has no way of knowing  what the true function looks like in regions where there is no data.  13-3  Overfitting  Interpolation  Extrapolation   13 Generalization  25  20  15  10  5  0  −5  −10  −15  −20  −25  −30 −3  25  20  15  10  5  0  −5  −10  −15  −20  −25  −30 −3  −2  −1  0  1  2  3  Figure 13.1  Example of Overfitting and Poor Extrapolation  In Figure 13.2 we have an example of a network that has been trained to  generalize well. The network has the same number of weights as the net- work of Figure 13.1, and it was trained using the same data set, but it has  been trained in such a way that it does not fully use all of the weights that  are available. It only uses as many weights as necessary to fit the data.

The network response outside this range will  be unpredictable. This is why it is important to have training data for all  regions of the input space where the network will be used. It is usually not  difficult to determine the required input range when the network has a sin- gle input, as in this example. However, when the network has many inputs,  it becomes more difficult to determine when the network is interpolating  and when it is extrapolating.  3        3–  3–  p1  p1   and    and   This problem is illustrated in a simple way in Figure 13.3.

We will discuss  some practical ways of dealing with this problem in Chapter 22.  p2  p2  p2  p2  p1  p1    3  a   b   t  8  6  4  2  0  −2  −4  −6 3  a  8  6  4  2  0  −2  −4  −6 3  2  1  p2  0  −1  −2  −3  −3  −2  0  −1  1  p1  3  2  2  1  p2  0  −1  −2  −3  −3  −2  0  −1  1  p1  3  2  Figure 13.3  Function  a  and Neural Network Approximation  b   Methods for Improving Generalization  The remainder of this chapter will discuss methods for improving the gen- eralization capability of neural networks. As we discussed earlier, there are  a number of approaches to this problem - all of which try to find the sim- plest network that will fit the data. These approaches fit into two general  categories: restricting the number of weights  or, equivalently, the number  of neurons  in the network, or restricting the magnitude of the weights. We  will concentrate on two methods that we have found to be particularly use- ful: early stopping and regularization. Both of these approaches attempt to  restrict the magnitude of the weights, although they do so in very different   13-5   Test Set  13 Generalization  ways. At the end of this chapter, we will demonstrate the approximate  equivalence of the two methods.  We should note that in this chapter we are assuming that there is a limited  amount of data with which to train the network. If the amount of data is  unlimited, which in practical terms means that the number of data points  is significantly larger than the number of network parameters, then there  will not be a problem of overfitting.  Estimating Generalization Error - The Test Set Before we discuss methods for improving the generalization capability of  neural networks, we should first discuss how we can estimate this error for  a specific neural network. Given a limited amount of available data, it is  important to hold aside a certain subset during the training process. After  the network has been trained, we will compute the errors that the trained  network makes on this test set. The test set errors will then give us an in- dication of how the network will perform in the future; they are a measure  of the generalization capability of the network.  In order for the test set to be a valid indicator of generalization capability,  there are two important things to keep in mind. First, the test set must  never be used in any way to train the neural network, or even to select one  network from a group of candidate networks. The test set should only be  used after all training and selection is complete. Second, the test set must  be representative of all situations for which the network will be used. This  can sometimes be difficult to guarantee, especially when the input space is  high-dimensional or has a complex shape. We will discuss this problem in  more detail in Chapter 22, Practical Training Issues.  In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will assume that a test set has  been removed from the data set before training begins, and that this set  will be used at the completion of training to measure generalization capa- bility.  Early Stopping The first method we will discuss for improving generalization is also the  simplest method. It is called early stopping [WaVe94]. The idea behind this  method is that as training progresses the network uses more and more of  its weights, until all weights are fully used when training reaches a mini- mum of the error surface. By increasing the number of iterations of train- ing, we are increasing the complexity of the resulting network. If training  is stopped before the minimum is reached, then the network will effectively  be using fewer parameters and will be less likely to overfit. In a later sec- tion of this chapter we will demonstrate how the number of parameters  changes as the number of iterations increases.  Cross-Validation  In order to use early stopping effectively, we need to know when to stop the  training. We will describe a method, called cross-validation, that uses a   13-6   Methods for Improving Generalization  Validation Set  13  validation set to decide when to stop [Sarl95]. The available data  after re- moving the test set, as described above  is divided into two parts: a training  set and a validation set. The training set is used to compute gradients or  Jacobians and to determine the weight update at each iteration. The vali- dation set is an indicator of what is happening to the network function “in  between” the training points, and its error is monitored during the training  process. When the error on the validation set goes up for several iterations,  the training is stopped, and the weights that produced the minimum error  on the validation set are used as the final trained network weights.  F  This process is illustrated in Figure 13.4. The graph at the bottom of this  figure shows the progress of the training and validation performance indi- ces,    the sum squared errors , during training. Although the training er- ror continues to go down throughout the training process, a minimum of  the validation error occurs at the point labeled “a,” which corresponds to  training iteration 14. The graph at the upper left shows the network re- sponse at this early stopping point. The resulting network provides a good  fit to the true function. The graph at the upper right demonstrates the net- work response if we continue to train to point “b,” where the validation er- ror has increased and the network is overfitting.  a  b  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  a2  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  a2  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  a  0  p  b  Validation  Training  0  p  103  102  F  101  100  10−1  100  13-7  101  Iteration  102  Figure 13.4  Illustration of Early Stopping   13 Generalization  The basic concept for early stopping is simple, but there are several practi- cal issues to be addressed. First, the validation set must be chosen so that  it is representative of all situations for which the network will be used. This  is also true for the test and training sets, as we mentioned earlier. Each set  must be roughly equivalent in its coverage of the input space, although the  size of each set may be different.   When we divide the data, approximately 70% is typically used for training,  with 15% for validation and 15% for testing. These are only approximate  numbers. A complete discussion of how to select the amount of data for the  validation set is given in [AmMu97].  Another practical point to be made about early stopping is that we should  use a relatively slow training method. During training, the network will  use more and more of the available network parameters  as we will explain  in the last section of this chapter . If the training method is too fast, it will  likely jump past the point at which the validation error is minimized.  To experiment with the effect of early stopping, use the MATLAB® Neural  Network Design Demonstration Early Stopping  nnd13es .  Regularization The second method we will discuss for improving generalization is called  regularization. For this method, we modify the sum squared error perfor- mance index of Eq.  13.3  to include a term that penalizes network com- plexity. This concept was introduced by Tikhonov [Tikh63]. He added a  penalty, or regularization, term that involved the derivatives of the approx- imating function  neural network in our case , which forced the resulting  function to be smooth. Under certain conditions, this regularization term  can be written as the sum of squares of the network weights, as in  F x   =  ED EW  +  =      tq  aq–  T tq    aq–    +   2 xi  ,   13.4   Q    q  1=  n  i  1=     where the ratio   controls the effective complexity of the network solu- tion. The larger this ratio is, the smoother the network response.  Note that  we could have used a single parameter here, but developments in later sec- tions will require two parameters.   Why do we want to penalize the sum squared weights, and how is this sim- ilar to reducing the number of neurons? Consider again the example mul- tilayer network shown in Figure 11.4. Recall how increasing a weight  increased the slope of the network function. You can see this effect again in  Figure 13.5, where we have changed the weight   from 0 to 2. When the  weights are large, the function created by the network can have large  slopes, and is therefore more likely to overfit the training data. If we re- strict the weights to be small, then the network function will create a   w1 1  2  13-8   Methods for Improving Generalization  smooth interpolation through the training data - just as if the network had  a small number of neurons.  13  3  2  1  0  a2  2  w1 1  2=  2  w1 1  0=  −1 −2  −1  1  2  0  p  Figure 13.5  Effect of Weight on Network Response  To experiment with the effect of weight changes on the network function, use  the MATLAB® Neural Network Design Demonstration Network Function   nnd11nf .  The key to the success of the regularization method in producing a network  that generalizes well is the correct choice of the regularization ratio  .  Figure 13.6 illustrates the effect of changing this ratio. Here we have  trained a 1-20-1 network on 21 noisy samples of a sine wave.     In the figure, the blue line represents the true function, and the large open  circles represent the noisy data. The black curve represents the trained  network response, and the smaller circles filled with crosses represent the  network response at the training points. From the figure, we can see that  the ratio   produces the best fit to the true function. For ratios  larger than this, the network response is too smooth, and for ratios smaller  than this, the network overfits.     0.01  =  There are several techniques for setting the regularization parameter. One  approach is to use a validation set, such as we described in the section on  early stopping; the regularization parameter is set to minimize the squared  error on the validation set [GoLa98]. In the next two sections we will de- scribe a different technique for automatically setting the regularization pa- rameter. It is called Bayesian regularization.  13-9   13 Generalization     0=     =  0.01  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1     =  0.25     1=  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  Figure 13.6  Effect of Regularization Ratio  To experiment with the effect of regularization, use the MATLAB® Neural  Network Design Demonstration Regularization  nnd13reg .  Bayesian Analysis Thomas Bayes was a Presbyterian minister who lived in England during  the 1700’s. He was also an amateur mathematician. His most important  work was published after his death. In it, he presented what is now known  as Bayes’ Theorem.

Assume that 1% of the population have a certain disease. There  is a test that can be performed to detect the presence of this disease. The  test is 80% accurate in detecting the disease in people who have it. Howev- er, 10% of the time, someone without the disease will register a positive  test. If you take the test and register positive, your question would be:  What is the probability that I actually have the disease? Most of us  includ- ing most physicians, as has been shown in many studies , would guess that  the probability is very high, considering that the test is 80% accurate in de- tecting the disease in a sick person. However, this turns out not to be the  case, and Bayes’ rule can help us overcome this lack of intuition, when it  comes to probability.    B  A  P A B   represent the event that you have the disease.

In order to use Bayes’ rule, we need one more  term, which is  whether or not you have the disease. This can be obtained by adding the  probability of having a positive test when you have the disease to the prob- ability of having a positive test when you don’t have the disease:  .

P A    For another example of using Bayes’ rule and the effect of the prior density,  see Solved Problem P13.2 and its associated demonstration.  In the next section, we will apply Bayesian analysis to the training of mul- tilayer networks. The advantage of Bayesian methods is that we can insert  prior knowledge through the selection of the prior probability. For neural  network training, we will make the prior assumption that the function we  are approximating is smooth. This means that the weights cannot be too  large, as was demonstrated in Figure 13.5. The trick will be to incorporate  this prior knowledge into an appropriate choice for the prior probability.  Bayesian Regularization Although there have been many approaches to the automatic selection of  the regularization parameter, we will concentrate on one developed by  David MacKay [MacK92]. This approach puts the training of neural net- works into a Bayesian statistical framework. This framework is useful for  many aspects of training, in addition to the selection of the regularization  parameter, so it is an important concept to become familiar with. There are  two levels to this Bayesian analysis. We will begin with Level I.  Level I Bayesian Framework  The Bayesian framework begins with the assumption that the network  weights are random variables. We then choose the weights that maximize  the conditional probability of the weights given the data. Bayes’ rule is  used to find this probability function:  P x D   M            =    P D x  M  P x  M -----------------------------------------------------------    P D   M         ,   13.10    is the vector containing all of the weights and biases in the net-  represents the training data set,    P D x  M  where  x  are parameters associ- work,  D ated with the density functions   is the   selected model - the architecture of the network we have chosen  i.e., how  many layers and how may neurons in each layer .   and    and  P x  M  , and   M          P D x  M  It is worth taking some time to investigate each of the terms in Eq.  13.10 .   is the probability density for the data, given a certain  First,   set of weights    which we will explain shortly , and the  x choice of model  .

This will allow the net- work weights to be large, and the network function will be allowed to have  more variation  as seen in Figure 13.6 .

We will dis- cuss this preprocessing of the training data in Chapter 22.  In Figure 13.7 you can see the results of training a 1-20-1 network with  GNBR on the same data set represented in Figure 13.4 and Figure 13.6.  The network has fit the underlying function, without overfitting to the  noise. The fit looks similar to that obtained in Figure 13.6, with the regu- larization ratio set to  with GNBR, the final regularization ratio for this example was     . In fact, at the completion of training   0.0137     0.01  =  =  .  The training process for this example is illustrated in Figure 13.8. In the  upper left of this figure, you see the squared error on the training set. No- tice that it does not necessarily go down at each iteration. In the upper  right of the figure, you see the squared testing error. This was obtained by  comparing the network function to the true function at a number of points  between -1 and 1. It is a measure of the generalization capability of the net- work.  This would not be possible in a practical case, where the true func- tion was unknown.  Note that the testing error is at its minimum at the  completion of training.   13-17   13 Generalization  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  102  100  ED  10−2  100  10−1  10−2  10−3  10−4  100     −0.8  −0.6  −0.4  −0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  Figure 13.7  Bayesian Regularization Fit        and the effective num- Figure 13.8 also shows the regularization ratio   during training.

There  are two disadvantages of a large network: 1  it may overfit the data, and 2   it requires more computation to calculate the network output. We have  overcome the first disadvantage by training with GNBR; although the net- work has 61 parameters, it is equivalent to a network with only 6 parame- ters. The second disadvantage is only important if the calculation time for  the network response is critical to the application. This is not usually the  case, since the time to calculate a network response to a particular input is  measured in milliseconds. In those cases where the calculation time is sig- nificant, you can train a smaller network on the data.  On the other hand, when the effective number of parameters is close to the  total number of parameters, this can mean that the network is not large  enough to fit the data. In this case, you should increase the size of the net- work and retrain on the data set.  To experiment with Bayesian Regularization, use the MATLAB® Neural  Network Design Demonstration Bayesian Regularization  nnd17breg .  Relationship Between Early Stopping and Regularization We have discussed two techniques for improving network generalization:  early stopping and regularization. These two methods were developed in  very different ways, but they both improve generalization by restricting the  network weights and, therefore, producing a network with fewer effective  parameters. Early stopping restricts the network weights by stopping the  training before the weights have converged to the minimum of the squared  error. Regularization restricts the weights by adding a term to the squared  error that penalizes large weights. In this section we want to demonstrate,  using a linear example, an approximate equivalence of these two methods.  During the process, we will also shed some light on the meaning of the ef- fective number of parameters,  . This development is based on the more  general procedures described in [SjLj94].    Early Stopping Analysis  Consider the single layer linear network shown in Figure 10.1. We have  shown in Eq.  10.12  and Eq.  10.14  that the mean square error perfor- mance function for this linear network is quadratic, of the form  F x   =  c dTx +  +  1 ---xTAx 2  ,   13.24   A   is the Hessian matrix. In order to study the performance of early  where  stopping, we will analyze the evolution of the steepest descent algorithm on  this linear network. From Eq.  10.16 , we know that the gradient of the per- formance index is  F x   =  Ax d+  .   13.25   13-19   13 Generalization  Therefore, the steepest descent algorithm  see Eq.  9.10   will be  xk  1+  =  xk gk  –  =  xk  Axk d+  –      .   13.26   We want to know how close we come to the minimum of the squared error  at each iteration. For quadratic performance indices, we know that the  minimum will occur at the following point  see Eq.  8.62  :  xML  –=  A 1– d  ,   13.27   where the superscript   indicates that this result maximizes the likeli- hood function, in addition to minimizing the squared error, as we saw in  Eq.  13.11 .  ML  We can now rewrite Eq.  13.26  as  xk  1+  =  xk A xk A 1– d  +  –      =  xk A xk  –    –  xML    .   13.28   With some additional algebra we can find  xk  1+  =  I A–  xk AxML  +  =  Mxk  +  I M–  xML  ,   13.29   where  Starting at the first iteration, using Eq.  13.29 , we have  . The next step is to relate   I A–  M  xk  1+  =     to the initial guess   x0  .   x1 Mx0  =  +  I M–  xML  ,   13.30   where the initial guess  Continuing to the second iteration:  x0   usually consists of random values near zero.   +  =  =  I M–  x2 Mx1  xML M2x0 M I M– + M2x0 MxML M2xML – M2x0 =  xML I M– xML MxML + – M2x0 I M– Following similar steps, at the kth iteration we have  xML M2xML  xML  =  +  +  +  +  =  –    2  xML  .   13.31   xk Mkx0  =  +  I Mk –  xML  ,   13.32   This key result shows how far we progress from the initial guess to the  maximum likelihood weights in k iterations. We will use this result later to  compare with regularization.  13-20   Methods for Improving Generalization  Recall from Eq.  13.4  that the regularized performance index adds a pen- alty term to the sum squared error, as in  Regularization Analysis  F x   =  ED EW  +  .   13.33   13  For the following analysis, it will more convenient to consider the following  equivalent  because the minimum occurs at the same place  performance  index  F x   =  F x  -----------  =  ED  +   ---E  W  =  ED EW  +  ,   13.34   which has only one regularization parameter.  The sum squared weight penalty term   EW   can be written  EW  =  x x0–  T x  x0–    ,   13.35   where the nominal value    is normally taken to be the zero vector.  x0  In order to locate the minimum of the regularized performance index,  which is also the most probable value  to zero:  , we will set the gradient equal   xMP  F  x   =  E D  EW+  =  0  .  The gradient of the penalty term, Eq.  13.35 , is  EW  =  2 x x0–    .   13.36    13.37   From Eq.  13.25  and Eq.  13.28 , the gradient of the sum squared error is  E D  =  Ax d+  =  A x A 1– d  +    =  A x  –  xML    .   13.38   We can now set the total gradient to zero:  F  x   =  A x  –  xML    +  2 x  x0–    =  0  .   13.39   The solution of Eq.  13.39  is the most probable value for the weights,  We can make that substitution and perform some algebra to obtain  xMP  .

We want to know the relationship between the regularized solution  and the minimum of the squared error  xMP  , so we can solve Eq.  13.42  for   xMP  xML  :     xMP Mx0  =  +  I M –  xML  .   13.43   This is the key result that describes the relationship between the regular- ized solution and the minimum of the squared error. By comparing Eq.   13.43  with Eq.  13.32 , we can investigate the relationship between early  stopping and regularization. We will do that in the next section.  Connection Between Early Stopping and Regularization  To compare early stopping and regularization, we need to compare Eq.   13.43  and Eq.  13.32 . They are summarized in Figure 13.9. We would like  to find out when these two solutions are equal. In other words, when do ear- ly stopping and regularization produce the same weights?

In- creasing the number of iterations   is approximately the same as decreas- k ing the regularization parameter  . This makes intuitive sense, because   increasing the number of iterations, or decreasing the regularization pa- rameter, can lead to overfitting.  Example, Interpretation of Effective Number of Parameters  2 2+  We will illustrate this result with a simple example. Suppose that we have  a single layer, linear network with no bias.

Suppose that we have a random variable that is uniform- ly distributed between 0 and x. We take a series of Q independent  samples of the random variable. Find the maximum likelihood es- timate of x. Before we begin this problem, let’s review the Level I Bayesian formulation  of Eq.  13.10 . We will not need the Level II formulation for this simple  problem, so we do not need the regularization parameters. Also, we only  have a single parameter to estimate, so x is a scalar. Eq.  13.10  can then  be simplified to  P x D    =    P x  P D x ------------------------------  P D  .  We are interested in the maximum likelihood estimate for this problem, so  we need to find the value of x that maximizes the likelihood term  .

Consider the function displayed in Figure 13.3. In that example, extrapo- lation occurred in the upper left region of the input space, because all of the  training data was in the lower right. Let’s provide training data around the  outside of the input space, but without data in the region  1.5–    p1    1.5  1.5–    p2    1.5  .

The neural network ap- proximation significantly overestimates the true function in the region  without training data, even though surrounded by regions with training  data. In addition, this result is random. With a different set of initial ran- dom weights, the network might underestimate the true function in this re- gion. Extrapolation occurs because there is a significantly large region  without training data. When the input space is of high dimension, it can be  very difficult to tell when a network is extrapolating. It cannot be done by  simply checking the individual ranges of each input variable.  13  a   b   t  8  6  4  2  0  −2  −4  −6 3  a  8  6  4  2  0  −2  −4  −6 3  2  1  0  p2  −1  −2  −3  −3  −2  0  −1  1  p1  3  2  2  1  0  p2  −1  −2  −3  −3  −2  0  −1  1  p1  3  2  Figure P13.5  Function  a  and Neural Network Approximation  b   P13.5 Consider the example starting on page 13-23.

Therefore, we are using approximately one of the two available parame- ters. The network has two parameters:  . The parameter we  are using is not one of these two, but rather a combination.

A  network that generalizes well will perform as well in new situations as it  performs on the data for which it was trained.   The basic approach to producing networks that generalize well is to find  the simplest network that can represent the data. A simple network is one  that has a small number of weights and biases.  The two methods that we presented in this chapter, early stopping and reg- ularization, produce simple networks by constraining the weights, rather  than by reducing the number of weights. We showed in this chapter that  constraining the weights is equivalent to reducing the number of weights.  Chapter 23 presents a case study that uses Bayesian regularization to pre- vent overfitting in a practical function approximation problem. Chapter 25  presents a case study that uses early stopping to prevent overfitting in a  practical pattern recognition problem.  13-44   Further Reading  Further Reading  [AmMu97]  S. Amari, N.

The  multilayer network that we have discussed in the last three chapters is a  static network. This means that the output can be calculated directly from  the input through feedforward connections. In dynamic networks, the out- put depends not only on the current input to the network, but also on the  current or previous inputs, outputs or states of the network. For example,  the adaptive filter networks we discussed in Chapter 10 are dynamic net- works, since the output is computed from a tapped delay line of previous  inputs. The Hopfield network we discussed in Chapter 3 is also a dynamic  network. It has recurrent  feedback  connections, which means that the  current output is a function of outputs at previous times.  We will begin this chapter with a brief introduction to the operation of dy- namic networks, and then we will describe how these types of networks can  be trained. The training will be based on optimization algorithms that use  gradients  as in steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms  or Ja- cobians  as in Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms  These  algorithms were described in Chapters 10, 11 and 12 for static networks.  The difference between the training of static and dynamic networks is in  the manner in which the gradient or Jacobian is computed. In this chapter,  we will present methods for computing gradients for dynamic networks.  14-1   14 Dynamic Networks  Theory and Examples  Dynamic Networks  D  Recurrent  Dynamic networks are networks that contain delays  or integrators, for  continuous-time networks  and that operate on a sequence of inputs.  In  other words, the ordering of the inputs is important to the operation of the  network.  These dynamic networks can have purely feedforward connec- tions, like the adaptive filters of Chapter 10, or they can also have some  feedback  recurrent  connections, like the Hopfield network of Chapter 3.  Dynamic networks have memory. Their response at any given time will de- pend not only on the current input, but on the history of the input sequence.  Because dynamic networks have memory, they can be trained to learn se- quential or time-varying patterns. Instead of approximating functions, like  the static multilayer perceptron network of Chapter 11, a dynmic network  can approximate a dynamic system. This has applications in such diverse  areas as control of dynamic systems, prediction in financial markets, chan- nel equalization in communication systems, phase detection in power sys- tems, sorting, fault detection, speech recognition, learning of grammars in  natural languages, and even the prediction of protein structure in genetics.  Dynamic networks can be trained using the standard optimization meth- ods that we have discussed in Chapters 9 through 12. However, the gradi- ents and Jacobians that are required for these methods cannot be  computed using the standard backpropagation algorithm. In this chapter  we will present the dynamic backpropagation algorithms that are required  for computing the gradients for dynamic networks.  There are two general approaches  with many variations  to gradient and  Jacobian calculations in dynamic networks: backpropagation-through- time  BPTT  [Werb90] and real-time recurrent learning  RTRL  [WiZi89].  In the BPTT algorithm, the network response is computed for all time  points, and then the gradient is computed by starting at the last time point  and working backward in time. This algorithm is efficient for the gradient  calculation, but it is difficult to implement on-line, because the algorithm  works backward in time from the last time step.   In the RTRL algorithm, the gradient can be computed at the same time as  the network response, since it is computed by starting at the first time  point, and then working forward through time. RTRL requires more calcu- lations than BPTT for calculating the gradient, but RTRL allows a conve- nient framework for on-line implementation. For Jacobian calculations,  the RTRL algorithm is generally more efficient than the BPTT algorithm.   In order to more easily present general BPTT and RTRL algorithms, it will  be helpful to introduce modified notation for networks that can have recur- rent connections. In the next section we will introduce this notation, and  then the remainder of the chapter will present general BPTT and RTRL al- gorithms for dynamic networks.  14-2   Layered Digital Dynamic Networks  Layered Digital Dynamic Networks  LDDN  In this section we want to introduce the neural network framework that we  will use to represent general dynamic networks. We call this framework  Layered Digital Dynamic Networks  LDDN . It is an extension of the nota- tion that we have used to represent static multilayer networks. With this  new notation, we can conveniently represent networks with multiple recur- rent  feedback  connections and tapped delay lines.  To help us introduce the LDDN notation, consider the example dynamic  network given in Figure 14.1.   14  Inputs  Layer 1  Layer 2  Layer 3  p1   t  R x 11  1  R 1  IW1,1  S 1 x R  b1  S 1 x 1  LW1,1  LW1,3  T D L  T D L  a1   t  T D L  1  S 1 x 1  n1   t  S 1 x 1  f 1  S 1  LW2,1  S 2 x S 1  b2  S 2 x 1  T D L  LW2,3  n2   t  S 2 x 1  a2   t  S 2 x 1  1  f 2  S 2  LW3,2  S 3 x S 2  b3  S 3 x 1  a3   t  S 3 x 1  n3   t  S 3 x 1  f 3  S 3  Figure 14.1  Example Dynamic Network  The general equations for the computation of the net input  m of an LDDN are  nm t    for layer   nm t   LWm l d al t  d–    l  = f Lm  Im  +  l      d DLm l     d DIm l  IWm l d pl t  d–    +  bm   14.1   Input Weight Layer Weight  pl t    is the l th input vector to the network at time t,   where  input weight between input l and layer m,  tween layer l and layer m,   is the set  of all delays in the tapped delay line between Layer l and Layer m,   is  the set of all delays in the tapped delay line between Input l and Layer m,    is the   is the layer weight be-   is the bias vector for layer m,   LWm l  DLm l  DIm l  IWm l  bm  14-3   D  Simulation Order  Backpropagation Order  14 Dynamic Networks   is the set of indices of input vectors that connect to layer m, and    is  Im the set of indices of layers that directly connect forward to layer m. The out- put of layer m is then computed as  f Lm  am t   =  fm nm t       .   14.2   Compare this with the static multilayer network of Eq.  11.6 . LDDN net- works can have several layers connecting to layer m. Some of the connec- tions can be recurrent through tapped delay lines. An LDDN can also have  multiple input vectors, and the input vectors can be connected to any layer  in the network; for static multilayer networks, we assumed that the single  input vector connected only to Layer 1.  With static multilayer networks, the layers were connected to each other in  numerical order. In other words, Layer 1 was connected to Layer 2, which  was connected to Layer 3, etc. Within the LDDN framework, any layer can  connect to any other layer, even to itself. However, in order to use Eq.   14.1 , we need to compute the layer outputs in a specific order. The order  in which the layer outputs must be computed to obtain the correct network  output is called the simulation order.  This order need not be unique; there  may be several valid simulation orders.  In order to backpropagate the de- rivatives for the gradient calculations, we must proceed in the opposite or- der, which is called the backpropagation order. In Figure 14.1, the  standard numerical order, 1-2-3, is the simulation order, and the backprop- agation order is 3-2-1.  As with the multilayer network, the fundamental unit of the LDDN is the  layer. Each layer in the LDDN is made up of five components:  1. a set of weight matrices that come into that layer  which may connect   from other layers or from external inputs ,  2. any tapped delay lines  represented by     that appear at  the input of a set of weight matrices  Any set of weight matrices can be  preceded by a TDL. For example, Layer 1 of Figure 14.1 contains the  weights    and the corresponding TDL. ,  DLm l  LW1 3 d   DIm l   or   3. a bias vector,  4. a summing junction, and  5. a transfer function.  The output of the LDDN is a function not only of the weights, biases, and  current network inputs, but also of some layer outputs at previous points  in time. For this reason, it is not a simple matter to calculate the gradient  of the network output with respect to the weights and biases. The weights  and biases have two different effects on the network output. The first is the  direct effect, which can be calculated using the standard backpropagation  algorithm from Chapter 11. The second is an indirect effect, since some of   14-4   Layered Digital Dynamic Networks  the inputs to the network are previous outputs, which are also functions of  the weights and biases. The main development of the next two sections is  a general gradient calculation for arbitrary LDDNs.  2 2+  Example Dynamic Networks Before we introduce dynamic training, let’s get a feeling for the types of re- sponses we can expect to see from dynamic networks. Consider first the  feedforward dynamic network shown in Figure 14.2.  14  Inputs  Linear Neuron  p t     iw1,1 0   D  D  iw1,1 2   iw1,1 1    cid:2   n t     a t     a t    =  iw   0   t +  p  iw   1   t-1  p   +  iw   2   t-2   p  1,1  1,1  1,1  Figure 14.2  Example Feedforward Dynamic Network  This is an ADALINE filter, which we discussed in Chapter 10  see Figure  10.5 . Here we are representing it in the LDDN framework. The network  has a TDL on the input, with  . To demonstrate the opera- tion of this network, we will apply a square wave as input, and we will set  all of the weight values equal to 1 3:   0 1 2  DI1 1  =        iw1 1 0   ,   iw1 1 1   ,   iw1 1 2   1 ---= 3  1 ---= 3  1 ---= 3  .  The network response is calculated from:  a t   =  n t   =  IW d p t  d–    2    =  n1 t   =  0= d iw1 1 0 p t   +  iw1 1 1 p t  1–    +  iw1 1 2 p t  2–    where we have left off the superscripts on the weight and the input, since  there is only one input and only one layer.   14.3    14.4   14-5   14 Dynamic Networks  The response of the network is shown in Figure 14.3. The open circles rep- resent the square-wave input signal  . The dots represent the network  response  . For this dynamic network, the response at any time point  depends on the previous three input values. If the input is constant, the  output will become constant after three time steps. This type of linear net- work is called a Finite Impulse Response  FIR  filter.  a t   p t   FIR  D  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5  0  5  10  15  20  25  Figure 14.3  Response of ADALINE Filter Network  This dynamic network has memory. Its response at any given time will de- pend not only on the current input, but on the history of the input sequence.  If the network does not have any feedback connections, then only a finite  amount of history will affect the response. In the next example, we will con- sider a network that has an infinite memory.  To experiment with the finite impulse response example, use the Neural Net- work Design Demonstration Finite Impulse Response Network  nnd14fir .  2 2+  Now consider another simple linear dynamic network, but one that has a  recurrent connection. The network in Figure 14.4 is a recurrent dynamic  network. The equation of operation of the network is  a1 t   = =  LW1 1 1 a1 t  =  n1 t  lw1 1 1 a t 1–  1–  iw1 1 p t     +  +  IW1 1 0 p1 t    14.5   where, in the last line, we have left off the superscripts, since there is only  one neuron and one layer in the network. To demonstrate the operation of  this network, we will set the weight values to  lw1 1 1    and   iw1 1  1 ---= 2  1 ---= 2  .   14.6   14-6   Layered Digital Dynamic Networks  Inputs  Linear Neuron  n t     a t     p t     iw1,1  cid:2  lw1,1 1   D  14      a t  =      iw p t  1,1  +  lw  1,1 1   a t    -1   Figure 14.4  Recurrent Linear Neuron  The response of this network to the square wave input is shown in Figure  14.5. The network responds exponentially to a change in the input se- quence. Unlike the FIR filter network of Figure 14.2, the exact response of  the network at any given time is a function of the infinite history of inputs  to the network.  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5  0  14-7  5  10  15  20  25  Figure 14.5  Recurrent Neuron Response  To experiment with this infinite impulse response example, use the Neural  Network Design Demonstration Infinite Impulse Response Network   nnd14iir .  Compare the dynamic networks of the previous two examples with the stat- ic, two-layer perceptron of Figure 11.4. Static networks can be trained to  approximate static functions, like  , where the output can be comput- ed directly from the current input. Dynamic networks, on the other hand,   p   sin   D  14 Dynamic Networks  can be trained to approximate dynamic systems, such as robot arms, air- craft, biological processes and economic systems, where the current system  output depends on a history of previous inputs and outputs. Because dy- namic systems are more complex than static functions, we expect that the  training process for dynamic networks will be more challenging than static  network training.  In the following section, we will discuss the computation of gradients for  the training of dynamic networks. For static networks, these gradients  were computed using the standard backpropagation algorithm. For dy- namic networks, the backpropagation algorithm must be modified.  Principles of Dynamic Learning  2 2+  Before we get into the details of training dynamic networks, let’s first in- vestigate a simple example. Consider again the recurrent network of Fig- ure 14.4. Suppose that we want to train the network using steepest  descent. The first step is to compute the gradient of the performance func- tion. For this example we will use sum squared error:  F x   =  e2 t   =    t t   –  a t   2  .   14.7   Q    t  1=  Q    t  1=  The two elements of the gradient will be   14.8    14.9    14.10   F x   ------------------------ lw1 1 1   =  Q    t  1=  e2 t   ------------------------ lw1 1 1   =  – 2  e t   a t   ------------------------ lw1 1 1   ,  Q  t  1=  Q  F x  --------------- iw1 1  =  Q    t  1=  e2 t  --------------- iw1 1  =  – 2  t  1=  e t  a t  --------------- iw1 1  The key terms in these equations are the derivatives of the network output  with respect to the weights:  a t   ------------------------ lw1 1 1    and   a t  --------------- iw1 1  .  1– a t  If we had a static network, then these terms would be very easy to compute.  They would correspond to  , respectively. However, for re- current networks, the weights have two effects on the network output. The  first is the direct effect, which is also seen in the corresponding static net- work. The second is an indirect effect, caused by the fact that one of the net- work inputs is a previous network output. Let’s compute the derivatives of  the network output, in order to demonstrate these two effects.   and   p t     14-8   Principles of Dynamic Learning  The equation of operation of the network is  a t   =  lw1 1 1 a t  1–    +  iw1 1 p t   .   14.11   We can compute the terms in Eq.  14.10  by taking the derivatives of Eq.   14.11 :  a t   ------------------------ lw1 1 1   =  1– a t    +  lw1 1 1  a t 1–  ------------------------ lw1 1 1   ,  a t  --------------- iw1 1  =  p t   +  lw1 1 1 a t   1– ---------------------- iw1 1  .   14.12    14.13   14  The first term in each of these equations represents the direct effect that  each weight has on the network output. The second term represents the in- direct effect. Note that unlike the gradient computation for static networks,  the derivative at each time point depends on the derivative at previous  time points  or at future time points, as we will see later .    a t  iw1 1  The following figures illustrate the dynamic derivatives. In Figure 14.6 a   we see the total derivatives   and also the static portions of the  derivatives. Note that if we consider only the static portion, we will under- estimate the effect of a change in the weight. In Figure 14.6 b  we see the  original response of the network  which was also shown in Figure 14.5  and  a new response, in which   is increased from 0.5 to 0.6. By comparing  the two parts of Figure 14.6, we can see how the derivative indicates the  effect on the network response of a change in the weight   iw1 1  .  iw1 1     b      Total Derivative Static Derivative  a   1.5  0.5  2  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5  −2    0  Original Response Incremental Response  1.5  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1  −1.5    0  5  10  15  20  25  5  10  15  20  25  Figure 14.6  Derivatives for    and Response of Network in Figure 14.4  iw1 1  In Figure 14.7 we see similar results for the weight  to get from this example are: 1  the derivatives have static and dynamic  components, and 2  the dynamic component depends on other time points.  .

In Chapter 11, we derived  the backpropagation algorithm for computing the gradient of  , which  we could then use with any of the optimization methods from Chapter 12  to minimize  . With dynamic networks, we need to modify the standard  backpropagation algorithm. There are two different approaches to this  problem. They both use the chain rule, but are implemented in different  ways:  F x   F x   F x   14-10   Principles of Dynamic Learning  F x------  Q  =  t  1=  a t   ------------ xT  T    eF ------------ a t   ,  F x------  Q  =  t  1=  ea t  --------------- xT  T    F ------------ a t   .  where the superscript e indicates an explicit derivative, not accounting for  indirect effects through time. The explicit derivatives can be obtained with  the standard backpropagation algorithm of Chapter 11. To find the com- plete derivatives that are required in Eq.  14.14  and Eq.  14.15 , we need  the additional equations:  14  or  and  a t   ------------ xT  =  ea t  --------------- xT  +  ea t  ------------------------ aT t   1–    a t 1–   --------------------- xT  F ------------ a t   =  eF ------------ a t   +  ea t 1+  ------------------------ aT t      F ---------------------- a t  1+  .  RTRL  Eq.  14.14  and Eq.  14.16  make up the real-time recurrent learning   RTRL  algorithm. Note that the key term is  BPTT  which must be propagated forward through time. Eq.  14.15  and Eq.   14.17  make up the backpropagation-through-time  BPTT  algorithm.  Here the key term is  a t   ------------ xT  ,  F ------------ a t   which must be propagated backward through time.  In general, the RTRL algorithm requires somewhat more computation  than the BPTT algorithm to compute the gradient. However, the BPTT al- gorithm cannot be conveniently implemented in real time, since the out- puts must be computed for all time steps, and then the derivatives must be  backpropagated back to the initial time point. The RTRL algorithm is well  suited for real time implementation, since the derivatives can be calculated  at each time step.  For Jacobian calculations, which are needed for Leven- berg-Marquardt algorithms, the RTRL algorithm is often more efficient  than the BPTT algorithm. See [DeHa07].   14-11   14.14    14.15    14.16    14.17    14.18    14.19    D  Input Layer  Output Layer  14 Dynamic Networks  Dynamic Backpropagation  In this section, we will develop general RTRL and BPTT algorithms for dy- namic networks represented in the LDDN framework. This development  will involve generalizing Eq.  14.14  through Eq.  14.17 .  Preliminary Definitions In order to simplify the description of the training algorithm, some layers  of the LDDN will be assigned as network outputs, and some will be as- signed as network inputs. A layer is an input layer if it has an input weight,  or if it contains any delays with any of its weight matrices. A layer is an  output layer if its output will be compared to a target during training, or if  it is connected to an input layer through a matrix that has any delays as- sociated with it.  For example, the LDDN shown in Figure 14.1 has two output layers  1 and  3  and two input layers  1 and 2 . For this network the simulation order is  1-2-3, and the backpropagation order is 3-2-1. As an aid in later deriva- tions, we will define U as the set of all output layer numbers and X as the  set of all input layer numbers. For the LDDN in Figure 14.1, U={1,3} and  X={1,2}.  The general equations for simulating an arbitrary LDDN network are giv- en in Eq.  14.1  and Eq.  14.2 . At each time point, these equations are it- erated forward through the layers, as  simulation order. Time is then incremented from    is incremented through the    to   Q=  1=  m  .  t  t  Real Time Recurrent Learning In this subsection we will generalize the RTRL algorithm, given in Eq.   14.14  and Eq.  14.16 , for LDDN networks. This development will follow  in many respects the development of the backpropagation algorithm for  static multilayer networks in Chapter 11. You may want to quickly review  that material before proceeding.  Eq.  14.14   The first step in developing the RTRL algorithm is to generalize Eq.   14.14 . For the general LDDN network, we can calculate the terms of the  gradient by using the chain rule, as in  F x------  Q  =    t  1=  u U  au t  --------------- xT  T    eF --------------- au t    .   14.20   If we compare this equation with Eq.  14.14 , we notice that in addition to  each time step, we also have a term in the sum for each output layer. How- ever, if the performance index   is not explicitly a function of a specific  output   , then that explicit derivative will be zero.

Now we need to account  for each output and also for the number of times each output is delayed be- fore it is input to another layer. That is the reason for the first two summa- tions in Eq.  14.21 . These equations must be updated forward in time, as  t is varied from 1 to Q. The terms   14  are generally set to zero for   t  0  .

To take advantage of these  efficiencies, we introduce some indicator sets. They are sets that tell us for  which layers the weights and the sensitivities are nonzero.  The first type of indicator set contains all of the output layers that connect  to a specified layer  x some nonzero delay:    which will always be an input layer  with at least   U x  ELW  =    u U      LWx u d   0  0 d      ,   14.31   where    means “such that,” and  means “there exists.”    The second type of indicator set contains the input layers that have a non- zero sensitivity with a specified layer   u  :  X u  ES  =    x X     Su x  0      .   14.32    is nonzero, there is a static connection from layer   Su x  to ouput  .

We will choose the following standard performance function with three  time points:  F  =    t t   –  a t   2  =  e2 t   =  e2 1   +  e2 2   +  e2 3   ,  Q    t  1=  3    t  1=  with the following inputs and targets:    p 1  t 1           p 2  t 2           p 3  t 3       .  The RTRL algorithm begins with some initialization:  U =  ,   ES 1  =  ,   X 1  = ES  .  In addition, the initial conditions for the delays,  vided.  p 0  p    1–    , must be pro-  The network response is then computed for the first time step:  a 1   =  n 1   =  iw1 1 0 p 1   +  iw1 1 1 p 0   +  iw1 1 2 p  1–    Because the RTRL algorithm proceeds forward through time, we can im- mediately compute the derivatives for the first time step. We will see in the  next section that the BPTT algorithm, which proceeds backward through  time, will require that we proceed through all of the time points before we  can compute the derivatives.  From the preceding pseudo-code, the first step in the derivative calculation  will be  since the transfer function is linear. We also update the following sets:  S1 1 1   =  F· 1 n1 1       =  1  ,  X 1  ES  =  1   ,   ES 1   =  1   .  14-18   14  Dynamic Backpropagation  The next step is the computation of the explicit derivatives from Eq.   14.42 :  ea1 1    ------------------------------------------ T vec IW1 1 0    ea1 1    ------------------------------------------ T vec IW1 1 1    =  =  ea 1  ----------------------- iw1 1 0   ea 1  ----------------------- iw1 1 1   ea1 1    ------------------------------------------ T vec IW1 1 2    =  ea 1  ----------------------- iw1 1 2   =    p1 1   T    S1 1  t   =  p 1   ,  =    p1 0   T    S1 1  t   =  p 0   ,  =    p1  1–    T    S1 1  t   =  p  1–    .  The next step would be to compute the total derivative, using Eq.  14.34 .  However, since  , the total derivatives are equal to the explicit  derivatives.  U 1  = ELW  All of the above steps would be repeated for each time point, and then the  final step is to compute the derivatives of the performance index with re- spect to the weights, using Eq.  14.20 :  F x------  =  Q      t  1=  u U  au t  --------------- xT  T    eF --------------- au t    =  3    t  1=  a1 t  --------------- xT  T    eF --------------- a1 t    .

We can then use this gradient in any of our standard optimization algo- rithms from Chapters 9 and 12. Note that if we use steepest descent, this  result is a batch form of the LMS algorithm  see Eq.  10.33  .  2 2+  Let’s now do an example using a recurrent neural network. Consider again  the simple recurrent network in Figure 14.4. From Eq.  14.5 , the equation  of operation of this network is  a t   =  lw1 1 1 a t  1–    +  iw1 1 p t   The architecture of the network is defined by  14-19   D  14 Dynamic Networks  U  =  1   ,   X  =  1   ,   I1  =  1   ,   DI1 1  =  0   ,   DL1 1  =  1   ,   f L1  =  1   ,   U 1  ELW  =  1   .  We will choose the same performance function as the previous example:  F  =    t t   –  a t   2  =  e2 t   =  e2 1   +  e2 2   +  e2 3   ,  Q    t  1=  3    t  1=  with the following inputs and targets:    p 1  t 1           p 2  t 2           p 3  t 3       .  We initialize with  U =  ,   ES 1  =  ,   X 1  = ES  .  In addition, the initial condition for the delay,  tives   a 0   , and the initial deriva-  a 0  --------------- iw1 1   and   a 0  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   must be provided.  The initial derivatives are usually set to zero.   The network response is then computed for the first time step:  a 1   =  lw1 1 1 a 0   +  iw1 1 p 1   The derivative calculation begins with  since the transfer function is linear. We also update the following sets:  S1 1 1   =  F· 1 n1 1       =  1  ,  X 1  ES  =  1   ,   ES 1   =  1   .  The next step is the computation of the explicit derivatives:  ea1 1    ------------------------------------------ T vec IW1 1 0    =  ea 1  ---------------- iw1 1  ea1 1    -------------------------------------------- T vec LW1 1 1    =  ea 1  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   =    p1 1   T    S1 1 1   =  p 1   ,  =    a1 0   T    S1 1 1   =  a 0   .  14-20   Dynamic Backpropagation  The next step is to compute the total derivative, using Eq.  14.34 :  a1 t  --------------- xT  =  ea1 t  ----------------- S1 1 xT  +  t LW1 1 1 a1 t 1–  ------------------------ xT  .   14.45   Replicating this formula for each of our weights for this network, for  we have  t  1=  ,   a 1  --------------- iw1 1  =  p 1   +  a 1  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   =  a 0   +  =  lw1 1 1  a 0  --------------- iw1 1 lw1 1 1  a 0  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   p 1   ,  =  a 0   .  14  Note that unlike the corresponding equation in the previous example, these  equations are recursive. The derivative at the current time depends on the  derivative at the previous time.  Note that the two initial derivatives on the  right side of this equation would normally be set to zero, but at the next  time step they would be nonzero.  As we mentioned earlier, the weights in  a recurrent network have two different effects on the network output. The  first is the direct effect, which is represented by the explicit derivative in  Eq.  14.45 . The second is an indirect effect, since one of the inputs to the  network is a previous output, which is also a function of the weights. This  effect causes the second term in Eq.  14.45 .  All of the above steps would be repeated for each time point:  ea 2  ---------------- iw1 1  =  p 2   ,   =  a 1   ,  ea 2  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   a 2  --------------- iw1 1  =  p 2   +  a 2  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   =  a 1   +  =  lw1 1 1  a 1  --------------- iw1 1 lw1 1 1  a 1  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   p 2   +  lw1 1 1 p 1   ,  =  a 1   +  lw1 1 1 a 0   ,  ea 3  ---------------- iw1 1  =  p 3   ,   =  a 2   ,  ea 3  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   a 3  --------------- iw1 1  =  p 3   a 3  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   =  a 2   +  +  lw1 1 1  a 2  --------------- iw1 1 lw1 1 1  a 2  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   =  p 3   +  lw1 1 1 p 2   +    lw1 1 1   2p 1   ,  =  a 2   +  lw1 1 1 a 1   +    lw1 1 1   2a 0   .  14-21   D  14 Dynamic Networks  The final step is to compute the derivatives of the performance index with  respect to the weights, using Eq.  14.20 :  F x------  =  Q      t  1=  u U  au t  --------------- xT  T    eF --------------- au t    =  3    t  1=  a1 t  --------------- xT  T    eF --------------- a1 t    .

We have included them here so  that we can compare this result with the BPTT algorithm, which we  present next.  Backpropagation-Through-Time In this section we will generalize the Backpropagation-Through-Time   BPTT  algorithm, given in Eq.  14.15  and Eq.  14.17 , for LDDN net- works.  The first step is to generalize Eq.  14.15 . For the general LDDN network,  we can calculate the terms of the gradient by using the chain rule, as in  Eq.  14.15   F ----------------------- m l d   lwi j  Q  =  Su     t  1=  u U  k  1=  F --------------- u t   ak    u t  eak ----------------- m t   ni  m t  eni ----------------------- m l d   lwi j   14.46    for the layer weights , where  layers, and   Su   is the number of neurons in layer   u  .  u   is an output layer, U is the set of all output   From Eq.  14.24  we can write  14-22   Dynamic Backpropagation  We will also define  The terms of the gradient for the layer weights can then be written   14.48   14  m t  eni ----------------------- m l d   lwi j  =  l t d– aj    .  m t  di  =  Su   F --------------- u t   ak    u t  eak ----------------- m t   ni  .  u U  k  1=  F ----------------------- m l d   lwi j  Q  =  t  1=  l t m t aj d– di    ,  If we use the sensitivity term defined in Eq.  14.26 ,  u m sk i  t     u t  eak ----------------- m t   ni  ,  then the elements   m t  di   can be written  In matrix form this becomes  where  m t  di  =  Su   F --------------- u t   ak  u U  k  1=    u m sk i  t   .  dm t   =  u U  Su m    t   T    F --------------- au t    F --------------- au t    =  F --------------- u t   a1  ---------------  F F ---------------- u u t   t   aSu a2  T  Now the gradient can be written in matrix form.

Eq.  14.17    14.55    14.56   The next step in the development of the BPTT algorithm is the generaliza- tion of Eq.  14.17 . Again, we use the chain rule:  F --------------- au t    =  eF --------------- au t    +      u' U  x X    d DLx u  eau' t  d+ --------------------------- T nx t d+     enx t  d+ --------------------------- au t T    T    F ------------------------- au' t   d+   14.57    Many of the terms in these summations will be zero. We will provide a  more efficient representation later in this section.  In Eq.  14.17  we only  had one delay in the system. Now we need to account for each network out- put, how that network output is connected back through a network input,  and also for the number of times each network output is delayed before it  is applied to a network input. That is the reason for the three summations  in Eq.  14.57 . This equation must be updated backward in time, as t is var- ied from Q to 1. The terms   F --------------- au' t     14.58   are generally set to zero for t > Q.   If we consider the matrix in the brackets on the right side of Eq.  14.57 ,  from Eq.  14.29  we can write  eau' t d+  --------------------------- T nx t d+     enx t d+  --------------------------- au t T    =  Su' x  d+ t   LWx u d    .   14.59   This allows us to write Eq.  14.57  as   14-24   Dynamic Backpropagation  F --------------- au t    =  eF --------------- au t   +      u' U  x X    d DLx u  Su' x    d+ t   LWx u d    T     14.60   F ------------------------- au' t   d+  Many of the terms in the summation on the right hand side of Eq.  14.60   will be zero and will not have to be computed. In order to provide a more  efficient implementation of Eq.  14.60 , we define the following indicator  sets:  14  X ELW  u   =    x X      LWx u d   0  0 d      ,  U x  ES  =    u U     Su x  0      .   14.61    14.62   u  The first set contains all of the input layers that have a connection from   with at least some nonzero delay. The second set contains  output layer  . When the  output layers that have a nonzero sensitivity with input layer  Su x sensitivity    to output layer    is nonzero, there is a static connection from input layer  u  x  x  .  We can now rearrange the order of the summation in Eq.  14.60  and sum  only over the existing terms:  F --------------- au t    =  eF --------------- au t   + X x ELW      LWx u d T  u     d DLx u  Su' x  d+ t  T    F ------------------------- au' t   d+   U x  u' ES     14.63   The total BPTT algorithm is summarized in the following pseudo code.

First, we use the feedforward  dynamic network of Figure 14.2. We defined the network architecture on  page 14-18.  Before the gradient can be computed using BPTT, the network response  must be computed for all time steps:  14  a 1   =  n 1   =  iw1 1 0 p 1   +  iw1 1 1 p 0   +  iw1 1 2 p  1–    ,  a 2   =  n 2   =  iw1 1 0 p 2   +  iw1 1 1 p 1   +  iw1 1 2 p 0   a 3   =  n 3   =  iw1 1 0 p 3   +  iw1 1 2 p 0   +  iw1 1 2 p 1   ,  .  The BPTT algorithm begins with some initialization:  U =  ,   ES 1  =  ,   U 1  = ES  .  The first step in the derivative calculation will be the sensitivity calcula- tion. For BPTT, we start at the last time point    3=   :  t  since the transfer function is linear. We also update the following sets:  The next step is the calculation of the following derivative using Eq.   14.63 :  S1 1 3   =  F· 1 n1 3       =  1  ,  U 1  ES  =  1   ,   ES 1   =  1   .

RTRL and BPTT should always produce the same  gradient. The only difference is in the implementation.  2 2+  Let’s now use our previous recurrent neural network example of Figure  14.4. We defined the architecture of this network on page 14-19.  Unlike the RTRL algorithm, where initial conditions for the derivatives  must be provided, the BPTT algorithm requires final conditions for the de- rivatives:  a 4  --------------- iw1 1   and   a 4  ----------------------- lw1 1 1   ,  which are normally set to zero.

Summary and Comments on Dynamic Training The RTRL and BPTT algorithms represent two methods for computing the  gradients for dynamic networks. Both algorithms compute the exact gradi- ent, and therefore they produce the same final results. The RTRL algo- rithm performs the calculations from the first time point forward, which is  suitable for on-line  real-time  implementation. The BPTT algorithm starts  from the last time point and works backward in time. The BPTT algorithm  generally requires fewer computations for the gradient calculation than  RTRL, but BPTT usually requires more memory storage.   In addition to the gradient, versions of BPTT and RTRL can be used to com- pute Jacobian matrices, as are needed in the Levenberg-Marquardt de- scribed in Chapter 12. For Jacobian calculations, the RTRL algorithm is  generally more efficient that the BPTT algorithm. See [DeHa07] for details.  Once the gradients or Jacobians are computed, many standard optimiza- tion algorithms can be used to train the networks. However, training dy- namic networks is generally more difficult than training feedforward  networks—for a number of reasons. First, a recurrent net can be thought  of as a feedforward network, in which the recurrent network is unfolded in  time. For example, consider the simple single-layer recurrent network of  Figure 14.4. If this network were to be trained over five time steps, we  could unfold the network to create 5 layers - one for each time step. If a sig- moid transfer function is used, then if the output of the network is near the  saturation point for any time point, the resulting gradient could be quite  small.  Another problem in training dynamic networks is the shape of the error  surface. It has been shown  see [PhHa13]  that the error surfaces of recur- rent networks can have spurious valleys that are not related to the dynam-  14-30   Dynamic Backpropagation  ic system that is being approximated. The underlying cause of these valleys  is the fact that recurrent networks have the potential for instabilities. For  example, the network of Figure 14.4 will be unstable if   is greater  than one in magnitude. However, it is possible, for a particular input se- quence, that the network output can be small for a particular value of  lw1 1 1  ues for    greater than one in magnitude, or for certain combinations of val- lw1 1 1   lw1 1 1    and   iw1 1  .   Finally, it is sometimes difficult to get adequate training data for dynamic  networks. This is because the inputs to some layers will come from tapped  delay lines. This means that the elements of the input vector cannot be se- lected independently, since the time sequence from which they are sampled  is generally correlated in time. Unlike static networks, in which the net- work response depends only on the input to the network at the current  time, dynamic network responses depend on the history of the input se- quence. The data used to train the network must be representative of all  situations for which the network will be used, both in terms of the ranges  for each input, but also in terms of the variation of the inputs over time.  14  2 2+  To illustrate the training of dynamic networks, consider again the simple  recurrent network of Figure 14.4, but let’s use a nonlinear sigmoid transfer  function, as shown in Figure 14.9.   Inputs  Tan-Sigmoid Neuron  n t     a t     p t     iw1,1  cid:2  lw1,1 1   D      a t  =    tansig      iw p t  1,1  +  lw  1,1   1    -1     a t  Figure 14.9  Nonlinear Recurrent Network  Recall from Chapter 11 that static multilayer networks can be used to ap- proximate functions. Dynamic networks can be used to approximate dy- namic systems. A function maps from one vector space  the domain  to  another vector space  the range . A dynamic system maps from one set of  time sequences  the input sequences    to another set of time sequences   . For example, the network of Figure 14.9 is a   the output sequences  dynamic system. It maps from input sequences to output sequences.  p t   a t   In order to simplify our analysis, we will give the network a problem for  which we know the optimal solution. The dynamic system we will approxi- mate is the same network, with the following values for the weights:  14-31   14 Dynamic Networks  lw1 1 1   =  0.5  ,   iw1 1  =  0.5  ,   14.64   The input sequence that we use to train a dynamic network must be repre- sentative of all possible input sequences. Because this network is so simple,  it is not difficult to find an appropriate input sequence, but for many prac- tical networks it can be difficult. We will use a standard form of input se- quence  called the skyline function , which consists of a series of pulses of  varying height and width. The input and target sequences are shown in  Figure 14.10. The circles represent the input sequence and the dots repre- sent the target sequence. The targets were created by applying the given  input sequence to the network of Figure 14.9, with the weights given by Eq.   14.64 .

Note that as the weight  tude, the squared error grows steeply. This effect would be even more  prominent, if the length of the training sequence were longer. However, we  can also see some narrow valleys in the surface in the regions where  lw1 1 1  [PhHa13]. See Exercise E14.18 to investigate the cause of these valleys.    is greater than one.  This is a very common result, as discussed in    becomes greater than one in magni-  lw1 1 1   The narrow valleys can have an effect on training, since the trajectory can  be trapped or misdirected by the spurious valleys.

However,  the calculation of the gradient for dynamic networks is more complex than  for static networks. There are two basic approaches to the gradient calcu- lation in dynamic networks. One approach, backpropagation through time   BPTT , starts at the last time point, and works backward in time to com- pute the gradient. The second approach, real-time recurrent learning   RTRL , starts at the first time point, and then works forward through  time.  RTRL requires more calculations than BPTT for calculating the gradient,  but RTRL allows a convenient framework for on-line implementation. Also,  RTRL generally requires less storage than BPTT. For Jacobian calcula- tions, RTRL is often more efficient than the BPTT algorithm.  Chapter 27 presents a real-world case study for using dynamic networks to  solve a prediction problem.  14-46   Further Reading  Further Reading  [DeHa07]  O. De Jesús and M.

Each network required a tar- get signal to define correct network behavior.  In contrast, this chapter introduces a collection of simple rules that allow  unsupervised learning. These rules give networks the ability to learn asso- ciations between patterns that occur together frequently. Once learned, as- sociations allow networks to perform useful tasks such as pattern  recognition and recall.  Despite the simplicity of the rules in this chapter, they will form the foun- dation for powerful networks in Chapters 16, 18, 19.  15-1   15 Associative Learning  Theory and Examples  This chapter is all about associations: how associations can be represented  by a network, how a network can learn new associations.  What is an association? An association is any link between a system’s input  and output such that when a pattern A is presented to the system it will  respond with pattern B. When two patterns are linked by an association,  the input pattern is often referred to as the stimulus. Likewise, the output  pattern is referred to as the response.  Stimulus Response  Associations are so fundamental that they formed the foundation of the be- haviorist school of psychology. This branch of psychology attempted to ex- plain much of animal and human behavior by using associations and rules  for learning associations.  This approach has since been largely discredit- ed.   One of the earliest influences on the behaviorist school of psychology was  the classic experiment of Ivan Pavlov, in which he trained a dog to salivate  at the sound of a bell, by ringing the bell whenever food was presented. This  is an example of what is now called classical conditioning. B. F. Skinner  was one of the most influential proponents of the behaviorist school. His  classic experiment involved training a rat to press a bar in order to obtain  a food pellet. This is an example of instrumental conditioning.  It was to provide a biological explanation for some of this behavior that led  Donald Hebb to his postulate, previously quoted in Chapter 7 [Hebb49]:  “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or  persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change  takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells fir- ing B, is increased.”  In Chapter 7 we analyzed the performance of a supervised learning rule  based on Hebb’s postulate. In this chapter we will discuss unsupervised  forms of Hebbian learning, as well as other related associative learning  rules.  A number of researchers have contributed to the development of associa- tive learning. In particular, Tuevo Kohonen, James Anderson and Stephen  Grossberg have been very influential. Anderson and Kohonen indepen- dently developed the linear associator network in the late 1960s and early  1970s  [Ande72], [Koho72] . Grossberg introduced nonlinear continuous- time associative networks during the same time period  e.g., [Gross68] . All  of these researchers, in addition to many others, have continued the devel- opment of associative learning up to the present time.  In this chapter we will discuss the elemental associative learning rules.  Then, in Chapters 14–16 we will present more complex networks that use   15-2   Simple Associative Network  associative learning as a primary component. Chapter 16 will describe Ko- honen networks, and Chapters 18 and 19 will discuss Grossberg networks.  Simple Associative Network  Let’s take a look at the simplest network capable of implementing an asso- ciation. An example is the single-input hard limit neuron shown in Figure  15.1.

Note that   is limited to the same  values by the hard limit transfer function. It indicates the presence or ab- sence of the network’s response.  a  p  p  =       1  stimulus  0  no stimulus            a  =       1  response  0  no response   15.2   The presence of an association between the stimulus  = 1, and the re- sponse  = 1 is dictated by the value of  stimulus only if   .

In order to demonstrate the operation of the associative  learning rules, without using complex networks, we will use simple net- works that have two types of inputs.  Unconditioned Stimulus  Conditioned Stimulus  One set of inputs will represent the unconditioned stimulus. This is analo- gous to the food presented to the dog in Pavlov’s experiment. Another set  of inputs will represent the conditioned stimulus. This is analogous to the  bell in Pavlov’s experiment. Initially the dog salivates only when food is   15-3   15 Associative Learning  2 2+  presented. This is an innate characteristic that does not have to be learned.  However, when the bell is repeatedly paired with the food, the dog is con- ditioned to salivate at the sound of the bell, even when no food is present.  We will represent the unconditioned stimulus as  stimulus simply as  associated with  justed according to the relevant learning rule.   and the conditioned  . For our purposes we will assume that the weights   are ad-  p  are fixed, but that the weights associated with   p0  p0  p  Figure 15.2 shows a network for recognizing bananas. The network has  both an unconditioned stimulus  banana shape  and a conditioned stimulus   banana smell . We don’t mean to imply here that smell is more condition- able than sight. In our examples in this chapter the choices of conditioned  and unconditioned stimuli are arbitrary and are used simply to demon- strate the performance of the learning rules. We will use this network to  demonstrate the operation of the Hebb rule in the following section.

The  problem is solved by assigning a value greater than   and assigning  .

For simple problems it is not difficult to design a network with a fixed set  of associations. On the other hand, a more useful network would be able to  learn associations.  When should an association be learned? It is generally accepted that both  animals and humans tend to associate things that occur simultaneously.  To paraphrase Hebb: if a banana smell stimulus occurs simultaneously  with a banana concept response  activated by some other stimulus such as  the sight of a banana shape , the network should strengthen the connection  between them so that later it can activate its banana concept in response  to the banana smell alone.  The unsupervised Hebb rule does just that by increasing the weight  tween a neuron’s input   wij  in proportion to their product:   and output    be-  pj wij q   ai  ai q pj q  +  .  =  wij q  1–   15.6    See also Eq.  7.5 .  The learning rate   dictates how many times a stimu- lus and response must occur together before an association is made. In the  network in Figure 15.2, an association will be made when  since then  of    will produce the response   , regardless of the value   b–  1=  1=  0.5  p0    w  ,   =  a  p  .  Note that Eq.  15.6  uses only signals available within the layer containing  the weights being updated. Rules that satisfy this condition are called local  learning rules. This is in contrast to the backpropagation rule, for example,  in which the sensitivity must be propagated back from the final layer. The  rules introduced in this chapter will all be local learning rules.  The unsupervised Hebb rule can also be written in vector form:  W q  W q  1–  =   a q pT q  +  .   15.7   Local Learning  Training Sequence  As with all unsupervised rules, learning is performed in response to a se- ries of inputs presented in time  the training sequence :  p 1  p 2    p Q          .   15.8   15-5   15 Associative Learning   Note that we are using the notation  , in order to empha- size the time-sequence nature of the inputs.

The asso- ciator will start with the weight values determined in our previous exam- ple, so that it will initially respond to the sight, but not the smell, of a  banana.  w0  =  1 w 0    =  0   15.9   The associator will be repeatedly exposed to a banana. However, while the  network’s smell sensor will work reliably, the shape sensor will operate  only intermittently  on even time steps . Thus the training sequence will  consist of repetitions of the following two sets of inputs:    p0 1  w0  0=    p 1   1=        p0 2   1=    p 2   1=      .   15.10   The first weight  lus  ing the unsupervised Hebb rule with a learning rate of 1:  , representing the weight for the unconditioned stimu-  will be updated at each iteration, us-  , will remain constant, while   p0  w  w q   =  w q  1–    +  a q p q   .  The output for the first iteration    q  1=    is  a 1   = =  hardlim w0p0 1  w 0 p 1  hardlim 1 0 =  + 0 1  0.5     +  –      0.5  – 0     no response  .  The smell alone did not generate a response. Without a response, the Hebb  rule does not alter   w  .  w 1   =  w 0   +  a 1 p 1   =  0  0 1+  =  0   15.13   In the second iteration, both the banana’s shape and smell are detected and  the network responds accordingly:  a 2   = =  hardlim w0p0 2  w 1 p 2  hardlim 1 1 =  + 0 1  0.5     +  –      0.5  – 1     banana  .   15.14   Because the smell stimulus and the response have occurred simultaneous- ly, the Hebb rule increases the weight between them.  w 2   =  w 1   +  a 2 p 2   =  0  1 1+  =  1   15.15   When the sight detector fails again, in the third iteration, the network re- sponds anyway. It has made a useful association between the smell of a ba- nana and its response.   15.11    15.12   15-6   15  Unsupervised Hebb Rule  a 3   = =  hardlim w0p0 3  w 2 p 3  hardlim 1 0 =  + 1 1  0.5     +  –      0.5  – 1     banana   w 3   =  w 2   +  a 3 p 3   =  1  1 1+  =  2   15.16    15.17   From now on, the network is capable of responding to bananas that are de- tected either by sight or smell. Even if both detection systems suffer inter- mittent faults, the network will be correct most of the time.  To experiment with the unsupervised Hebb rule, use the Neural Network De- sign Demonstration Unsupervised Hebb Rule  nnd13uh .  We have seen that the unsupervised Hebb rule can learn useful associa- tions. However, the Hebb rule, as defined in Eq.  15.6 , has some practical  shortcomings. The first problem becomes evident if we continue to present  inputs and update   will become ar- bitrarily large. This is at odds with the biological systems that inspired the  Hebb rule. Synapses cannot grow without bound.   in the example above. The weight   w  w  The second problem is that there is no mechanism for weights to decrease.  If the inputs or outputs of a Hebb network experience any noise, every  weight will grow  however slowly  until the network responds to any stim- ulus.  Hebb Rule with Decay One way to improve the Hebb rule is by adding a weight decay term  Eq.   7.45  ,  W q  W q  1–  =   a q pT q  +  –  W q  1–    =  – 1  W q  1–   a q pT q  , +   15.18     , the decay rate, is a positive constant less than one. As    approach- where  es zero, the learning law becomes the standard rule. As   approaches one,  the learning law quickly forgets old inputs and remembers only the most  recent patterns. This keeps the weight matrix from growing without  bound.  The idea of filtering the weight changes was also discussed in  Chapter 12, where we called it momentum.       .

We will use a decay rate   of 0.1. The first itera- tion, where only the smell stimulus is presented, is the same:    a 1   =   0     no response       w  1   0=  .   15.20   The next iteration also produces identical results. Here both stimuli are  presented, and the network responds to the shape. Coincidence of the smell  stimulus and response create a new association:  a 2   =   1     banana       w 2   1=  .   15.21   The results of the third iteration are not the same. The network has  learned to respond to the smell, and the weight continues to increase. How- ever, this time the weight increases by only 0.9, instead of 1.0.  w 3   =  w 2   +  a 3 p 3   –  0.1w 2   =  1  +  1 1  –  0.1 1  =  1.9   15.22   The decay term limits the weight’s value, so that no matter how often the  association is reinforced,    will never increase beyond   max  w  .  wij  max  wij  =   ---  =  1 ------- 0.1  =  10   15.23   The new rule also ensures that associations learned by the network will not  be artifacts of noise. Any small random increases will soon decay away.  Figure 15.3 displays the response of the Hebb rule, with and without decay,  for the banana recognition example. Without decay, the weight continues  to increase by the same amount each time the neuron is activated. When  decay is added, the weight exponentially approaches its maximum value    wij To experiment with the Hebb rule with decay, use the Neural Network De- sign Demonstrations Hebb with Decay nnd13hd  and Effect of Decay Rate   nnd13edr .  10=  max   .  15-8   Simple Recognition Network  10  8  6  4  2  w  30  20  10  0 0  Hebb Rule  Hebb with Decay  15  10  20  q  30  0 0  10  20  30  q  Figure 15.3  Response of the Hebb Rule, With and Without Decay  The Hebb rule with decay does solve the problem of large weights. Howev- er, it does so at a price. The environment must be counted on to occasionally  present all stimuli that have associations. Without reinforcement, associa- tions will decay away.

Any association that was previously learned will eventually be lost.   0=  Simple Recognition Network  Instar  So far we have considered only associations between scalar inputs and out- puts. We will now examine a neuron that has a vector input.  See Figure  15.4.  This neuron, which is sometimes referred to as an instar, is the sim- plest network that is capable of pattern recognition, as we will demonstrate  shortly.   15-9   15 Associative Learning  Inputs  Hard Limit Neuron  p1  p2  pR  w1,1 w1,2  w1,R   cid:0  cid:0 Σ  cid:0  cid:0   n  a  b  1  a = hardlim  Wp + b   Figure 15.4  Instar  You will notice the similarities between the instar of Figure 15.4 and the  perceptron of Figure 4.2  also the ADALINE of Figure 10.2 and the linear  associator of Figure 7.1 . We give these networks different names, in part  for historical reasons  since they arose at different times and out of differ- ent environments , and because they perform different functions and are  analyzed in different ways. For example, we will not directly consider the  decision boundary of the instar, although this was an important concept for  the perceptron. Instead, we will analyze the ability of the instar to recog- nize a pattern, as with the neurons in the first layer of the Hamming net- work.  See page 3-10.   The input output expression for the instar is  a  =  hardlim Wp b+      =  hardlim wT    p b+    .  1   15.26   The instar will be active whenever the inner product between the weight  vector  row of the weight matrix  and the input is greater than or equal to  b–  :  wT 1  p  b–  .   15.27   From our discussion of the Hamming network on page 3-10, we know that  for two vectors of constant length, the inner product will be largest when  they point in the same direction. We can also show this using Eq.  5.15 :  wT 1  p  =  w1  p  cos  b–  ,   15.28    is the angle between the two vectors. Clearly the inner product is     where  maximized when the angle     w1=  p   , then the inner product will be largest when   p  w1=  .     is 0. If   p   and   w1   have the same length   Based on these arguments, the instar of Figure 15.4 will be active when    p  appropriately, we can select how close  is “close” to  the input vector must be to the weight vector in order to activate the instar.  . By setting the bias   w1  b  15-10   Instar Rule  If we set  b  –=  w1  p  ,   15.29   then the instar will only be active when  tion as  pattern    points in exactly the same direc-  . Thus, we will have a neuron that recognizes only the   0=  p       w1 . w1  If we would like the instar to respond to any pattern near  then we can increase  p value of  making it the less discriminatory.  w1 . The larger the  , the more patterns there will be that can activate the instar, thus    to some value larger than    small ,   w1        –  b  b  We should note that this analysis assumes that all input vectors have the  same length  norm . We will revisit the question of normalization in Chap- ters 16, 18 and 19.  15  We can now design a vector recognition network if we know which vector  we want to recognize. However, if the network is to learn a vector without  supervision, we need a new rule, since neither version of the Hebb rule pro- duces normalized weights.  Instar Rule  One problem of the Hebb rule with decay was that it required stimuli to be  repeated or associations would be lost. A better rule might allow weight de- cay only when the instar is active    . Weight values would still be lim- ited, but forgetting would be minimized. Consider again the original Hebb  rule:  0  a  wij q   =  wij q 1–   ai q pj q  +  .   15.30   To get the benefits of weight decay, while limiting the forgetting problem,  a decay term can be added that is proportional to   :  wij q   =  wij q  1–   ai q pj q  +  –   15.31   We can simplify Eq.  15.31  by setting  are learned at the same rate old values decay  and gathering terms.    so new weight values    equal to       ai q  ai q wij q  1–    wij q   =  wij q  1–   ai q  pj q  wij q +  1–  –         15.32   Instar Rule  This equation, called the instar rule, can also be rewritten in vector form:  w q   i  =  i  w q  1–    +  ai q  p q  w q  i–  1–        .   15.33   The performance of the instar rule can be best understood if we consider  the case where the instar is active    . Eq.  15.33  can then be written  1=  ai  15-11   15 Associative Learning  w q   i  w q  1–    +   p q  w q  1–        i–  i  =  =  1 –   w q i  1–    +  p q  .   15.34   This operation is displayed graphically in Figure 15.5.  p q   iw q   iw q - 1   Figure 15.5  Graphical Representation of the Instar Rule  When the instar is active, the weight vector is moved toward the input vec- tor along a line between the old weight vector and the input vector.

To experiment with the instar rule, use the Neural Network Design Demon- strations Instar  nnd13is  and Graphical Instar  nnd13gis .  Kohonen Rule At this point it is appropriate to introduce another associative learning  rule, which is related to the instar rule. It is the Kohonen rule:  Kohonen Rule  w q   =  i  w q i  1–    +   p q  w q  1–             for i    X q   .  i–   15.46   Like the instar rule, the Kohonen rule allows the weights of a neuron to  learn an input vector and is therefore suitable for recognition applications.  Unlike the instar rule, learning is not proportional to the neuron’s output   is a member of  ai q  the set   . Instead, learning occurs when the neuron’s index   X q   .  i  If the instar rule is applied to a layer of neurons whose transfer function  only returns values of 0 or 1  such as hardlim , then the Kohonen rule can  be made equivalent to the instar rule by defining  such that  . The advantage of the Kohonen rule is that it can also  be used with other definitions. It is useful for training networks such as the  self-organizing feature map, which will be introduced in Chapter 16.   as the set of all   ai q   X q   1=     i  15-15   15 Associative Learning  Simple Recall Network  Outstar  We have seen that the instar network  with a vector input and a scalar out- put  can perform pattern recognition by associating a particular vector  stimulus with a response. The outstar network, shown in Figure 15.7, has  a scalar input and a vector output. It can perform pattern recall by associ- ating a stimulus with a vector response.  The input-output expression for this network is  a  =  satlins Wp      .   15.47   The symmetric saturating function  work will be used to recall a vector containing values of -1 or 1.   was chosen because this net-  satlins  Symmetric Saturating  Linear Layer  Input  p  a1   a2   aS  w1,1  n1 cid:0  cid:0 Σ  cid:0   cid:0   cid:0  cid:0 Σ w2,1 n2  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  nS  cid:0  cid:0 Σ  cid:0  wS,1  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a = satlins  Wp   Figure 15.7  Outstar Network  If we would like the network to associate a stimulus  an input of 1  with a  particular output vector    which contains only a  single column vector  equal to    is 1, the output will be   , we can simply set   .

We know the network must have three inputs, because it must recognize  three-element vectors. We also know that it will have two outputs, one out- put for each response.  Such a network can be obtained by combining two instars into a single lay- er, as in Figure P15.2.  15-26   Solved Problems  Inputs  Hard Limit Layer  p1  p2  p3  w1,1   cid:0  cid:0 Σ  cid:0  cid:0   n1  a1  1  b1  cid:0  cid:0 Σ w2,3  cid:0  cid:0  b2  1   cid:0  cid:0  n2 a2  cid:0  cid:0   a = hardlim  Wp + b   15  Figure P15.2  Two-Vector Recognition Network  We now set the weights  , so that its net  input will be at a maximum when an input vector points in the same direc- tion as   so that the second neuron is most   to  . sensitive to vectors in the direction of    of the first neuron equal to   .

We also developed and studied several learning rules that  allowed networks to create new associations. Each rule operated by  strengthening an association between any stimulus and response that  occurred simultaneously.  The simple associative networks and learning rules developed in this chap- ter are useful in themselves, but they are also important building blocks for  more powerful networks. In this chapter we introduced two networks, and  associated learning rules, that will be fundamental for the development of  important networks in the next three chapters: the instar and the outstar.  The instar is a network that is trained to recognize a pattern. The outstar  is a network that is trained to recall a pattern. We will use layers of instars  in Chapters 16 and 18 to perform pattern recognition. These networks are  very similar to the Hamming network of Chapter 3, whose first layer was,  in fact, a layer of instars. In Chapter 19 we will introduce a more complex  network, which combines both instars and outstars in order to produce sta- ble learning.  15-34   Further Reading  Further Reading  [Ande72]   J.

When  an executive enters the elevator on the ground floor, it determines which  person it is with a retinal scan, and then uses the network to select the floor  where that person is most likely to go to. If the guess is incorrect, the per- son can push a different button at any time, but if the network is correct, it  will save an important executive the effort of pushing a button.  15-40   Exercises  Floor Code  Retinal Scan  Floor?

It required that  the prototype patterns be known beforehand and incorporated into the net- work as rows of a weight matrix.  In this chapter we will discuss networks that are very similar in structure  and operation to the Hamming network. Unlike the Hamming network,  however, they use the associative learning rules of Chapter 15 to adaptive- ly learn to classify patterns. Three such networks are introduced in this  chapter: the competitive network, the feature map and the learning vector  quantization  LVQ  network.  16-1   16 Competitive Networks  Theory and Examples  The Hamming network is one of the simplest examples of a competitive  network. The neurons in the output layer of the Hamming network com- pete with each other to determine a winner. The winner indicates which  prototype pattern is most representative of the input pattern. The compe- tition is implemented by lateral inhibition — a set of negative connections  between the neurons in the output layer. In this chapter we will illustrate  how this competition can be combined with the associative learning rules  of Chapter 15 to produce powerful self-organizing  unsupervised  net- works.  As early as 1959, Frank Rosenblatt created a simple “spontaneous” classi- fier, an unsupervised network based on the perceptron, which learned to  classify input vectors into two classes with roughly equal members.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Stephen Grossberg introduced many  competitive networks that used lateral inhibition to good effect. Some of  the useful behaviors he obtained were noise suppression, contrast-en- hancement and vector normalization. His networks will be examined in  Chapters 18 and 19.  In 1973, Christoph von der Malsburg introduced a self-organizing learning  rule that allowed a network to classify inputs in such a way that neighbor- ing neurons responded to similar inputs. The topology of his network mim- icked, in some ways, the structures previously found in the visual cortex of  cats by David Hubel and Torten Wiesel. His learning rule generated a great  deal of interest, but it used a nonlocal calculation to ensure that weights  were normalized. This made it less biologically plausible.  Grossberg extended von der Malsburg's work by rediscovering the instar  rule, examined in Chapter 15.  The instar rule had previously been intro- duced by Nils Nilsson in his 1965 book Learning Machines.  Grossberg  showed that the instar rule removed the necessity of re-normalizing  weights, since weight vectors that learn to recognize normalized input vec- tors will automatically be normalized themselves.  The work of Grossberg and von der Malsburg emphasizes the biological  plausibility of their networks. Another influential researcher, Teuvo Ko- honen, has also been a strong proponent of competitive networks. However,  his emphasis has been on engineering applications and efficient mathe- matical descriptions of the networks. During the 1970s he developed a sim- plified version of the instar rule and also, inspired by the work of von der  Malsburg and Grossberg, found an efficient way to incorporate topology  into a competitive network.  In this chapter we will concentrate on the Kohonen framework for compet- itive networks. His models illustrate the major features of competitive net-  16-2   Hamming Network  works, and yet they are mathematically more tractable than the Grossberg  networks. They provide a good introduction to competitive learning.  We will begin with the simple competitive network. Next we will present  the self-organizing feature map, which incorporates a network topology. Fi- nally, we will discuss learning vector quantization, which incorporates  competition within a supervised learning framework.  Hamming Network  Since the competitive networks discussed in this chapter are closely related  to the Hamming network  shown in Figure 16.1 , it is worth reviewing the  key concepts of that network first.

The first layer  which is a  layer of instars  performs a correlation between the input vector and the  prototype vectors. The second layer performs a competition to determine  which of the prototype vectors is closest to the input vector.  Layer 1 Recall from Chapter 15  see page 15-9 and following  that a single instar is  able to recognize only one pattern. In order to allow multiple patterns to be  classified, we need to have multiple instars. This is accomplished in the  Hamming network.  Suppose that we want the network to recognize the following prototype vec- tors:    p1 p2   pQ          .   16.1   16-3   16 Competitive Networks  Then the weight matrix,   W1  , and the bias vector,   b1  , for Layer 1 will be:  W1  =  =  ,   b1  =  ,   16.2   1  wT wT 2  wT  S  p1 T p2 T  pQ T  R R  R  W1  where each row of  ognize, and each element of  each input vector    .  The number of neurons,  of prototype vectors which are to be recognized,    represents a prototype vector which we want to rec-  is set equal to the number of elements in  , is equal to the number  .    S Q  b1  R  Thus, the output of the first layer is  a1 W1p b1+  =  =   16.3   p1 Tp R+ Tp R+ p2  pQ T p R+  .  Note that the outputs of Layer 1 are equal to the inner products of the pro- totype vectors with the input, plus  . As we discussed in Chapter 3  page  3-9 , these inner products indicate how close each of the prototype patterns  is to the input vector.  This was also discussed in our presentation of the  instar on page 15-10.   R  Layer 2 In the instar of Chapter 15, a   transfer function was used to decide  if the input vector was close enough to the prototype vector. In Layer 2 of  the Hamming network we have multiple instars, therefore we want to de- cide which prototype vector is closest to the input. Instead of the    hardlim transfer function, we will use a competitive layer to choose the closest pro- totype.  hardlim  Layer 2 is a competitive layer. The neurons in this layer are initialized with  the outputs of the feedforward layer, which indicate the correlation be- tween the prototype patterns and the input vector. Then the neurons com- pete with each other to determine a winner. After the competition, only one  neuron will have a nonzero output. The winning neuron indicates which  category of input was presented to the network  each prototype vector rep- resents a category .  The first-layer output    is used to initialize the second layer.  a1  a2 0   a1=   16.4   16-4   Competitive Layer  Then the second-layer output is updated according to the following recur- rence relation:  a2 t The second-layer weights  and the off-diagonal elements have a small negative value.  poslin W2a2 t   1+  W2  =        .   are set so that the diagonal elements are 1,    16.5   2 wij  =      j=    1    if i –    otherwise     ,  where   0       1 ------------ 1– S   16.6   Lateral Inhibition  This matrix produces lateral inhibition, in which the output of each neuron  has an inhibitory effect on all of the other neurons. To illustrate this effect,  substitute weight values of 1 and  ,  and rewrite Eq.  16.5  for a single neuron.   for the appropriate elements of   W2  –  2 t 1+ ai    =  poslin ai  2 t       2 t  aj   –   j  i   16.7   16  At each iteration, each neuron’s output will decrease in proportion to the  sum of the other neurons’ outputs  with a minimum output of 0 . The out- put of the neuron with the largest initial condition will decrease more slow- ly than the outputs of the other neurons. Eventually that neuron will be the  only one with a positive output. At this point the network has reached  steady state. The index of the second-layer neuron with a stable positive  output is the index of the prototype vector that best matched the input.  Winner-Take-All  This is called a winner-take-all competition, since only one neuron will have  a nonzero output. In Chapter 18 we will discuss other types of competition.  You may wish to experiment with the Hamming network and the apple or- ange classification problem. The Neural Network Design Demonstration  Hamming Classification  nnd3hamc  was previously introduced in Chapter 3.  Competitive Layer  Competition  The second-layer neurons in the Hamming network are said to be in com- petition because each neuron excites itself and inhibits all the other neu- rons. To simplify our discussions in the remainder of this chapter, we will  define a transfer function that does the job of a recurrent competitive layer:  It works by finding the index   of the neuron with the largest net input,  and setting its output to 1  with ties going to the neuron with the lowest  index . All other outputs are set to 0.  compet n    .  a  = i   16.8   16-5   16 Competitive Networks  ai  =      i= 1 i i 0 i  , where    ni  ni  i  , and    i  i  ni=  ni   16.9   Replacing the recurrent layer of the Hamming network with a competitive  transfer function on the first layer will simplify our presentations in this  chapter.

One such learning rule is the  instar rule from Chapter 15:   to the desired prototype vectors. However, we would like to have a   wi  q   =  wi  1– q   ai q  p q  wi +  –    1– q      .   16.12   For the competitive network,    i   is only nonzero for the winning neuron   .

It moves along a line between the old row of the weight matrix and  the input vector, as shown in Figure 16.3.  p q   iw q   iw q - 1   Figure 16.3  Graphical Representation of the Kohonen Rule  2 2+  Let’s use the six vectors in Figure 16.4 to demonstrate how a competitive  layer learns to classify vectors. Here are the six vectors:  p1  =  p4  =  0.1961 – 0.9806    p2  =  0.1961 0.9806    p3  =  0.9806 0.1961  0.9806 0.1961 –    p5  =  – –  0.5812 0.8137    p6  =  – –  0.8137 0.5812   .   16.15   16-7   16 Competitive Networks  Figure 16.4  Sample Input Vectors  Our competitive network will have three neurons, and therefore it can clas- sify vectors into three classes. Here are the “randomly” chosen normalized  initial weights:  p1 p2  w1  =  0.7071 – 0.7071    w2  =  0.7071 0.7071    w3  =  – 1.0000 0.0000  ,   W  =  .   16.16   1  wT wT 2 w3 T  The data vectors are shown at left, with the weight vectors displayed as ar- rows. Let’s present the vector    to the network:  p2  a  =  compet Wp2      =  compet   16.17         –  0.7071 0.7071 0.7071 0.7071 0.0000 – 1.0000  0.1961 0.9806        2w  1w  p3 p4  3w  p6  p5  =  compet      –  0.5547 – 0.8321 0.1961        =   .  0 1 0  The second neuron’s weight vector was closest to  tition   the winning neuron with a learning rate of   , so it won the compe-   and output a 1.

If we continue choosing input vectors at random and presenting them  to the network, then at each iteration the weight vector closest to the input  vector will move toward that vector. Eventually, each weight vector will    closer to   w2  p2  16-8   Competitive Layer  point at a different cluster of input vectors. Each weight vector becomes a  prototype for a different cluster.  This problem is simple enough that we can predict which weight vector will  point at which cluster. The final weights will look something like those  shown in Figure 16.5.  p1 p2  2w  1w  p3 p4  3w  p6  p5  Figure 16.5  Final Weights  2w  1w  3w  stable  slow  α ≈ 0  unstable  fast  α ≈ 1  16  Once the network has learned to cluster the input vectors, it will classify  new vectors accordingly.The diagram in the left margin uses shading to  show which region each neuron will respond to. The competitive layer as- signs each input vector   to one of these classes by producing an output of  1 for the neuron whose weight vector is closest to   p  .  p  To experiment with the competitive learning use the Neural Network Design  Demonstration Competitive Learning  nnd14cl .  Problems with Competitive Layers Competitive layers make efficient adaptive classifiers, but they do suffer  from a few problems. The first problem is that the choice of learning rate  forces a trade-off between the speed of learning and the stability of the final  weight vectors. A learning rate near zero results in slow learning. However,  once a weight vector reaches the center of a cluster it will tend to stay close  to the center.  In contrast, a learning rate near 1.0 results in fast learning. However, once  the weight vector has reached a cluster, it will continue to oscillate as dif- ferent vectors in the cluster are presented.  Sometimes this trade-off between fast learning and stability can be used to  advantage. Initial training can be done with a large learning rate for fast  learning. Then the learning rate can be decreased as training progresses,  to achieve stable prototype vectors. Unfortunately, this technique will not  work if the network needs to continuously adapt to new arrangements of  input vectors.  A more serious stability problem occurs when clusters are close together.  In certain cases, a weight vector forming a prototype of one cluster may “in-  16-9   16 Competitive Networks  vade” the territory of another weight vector, and therefore upset the cur- rent classification scheme.  The series of four diagrams in Figure 16.6 illustrate this problem. Two in- put vectors  shown with blue circles in diagram  a   are presented several  times. The result is that the weight vectors representing the middle and  right clusters shift to the right. Eventually one of the right cluster vectors  is reclassified by the center weight vector. Further presentations move the  middle vector over to the right until it “loses” some of its vectors, which  then become part of the class associated with the left weight vector.   a    b    c    d   Figure 16.6  Example of Unstable Learning  A third problem with competitive learning is that occasionally a neuron’s  initial weight vector is located so far from any input vectors that it never  wins the competition, and therefore never learns. The result is a “dead”  neuron, which does nothing useful. For example, the downward-pointing  weight vector in the diagram to the left will never learn, regardless of the  order in which vectors are presented. One solution to this problem consists  of adding a negative bias to the net input of each neuron and then decreas- ing the bias each time the neuron wins. This will make it harder for a neu- ron to win the competition if it has won often. This mechanism is  sometimes called a “conscience.”  See Exercise E16.4.   Finally, a competitive layer always has as many classes as it has neurons.  This may not be acceptable for some applications, especially when the num- ber of clusters is not known in advance. In addition, for competitive layers,  each class consists of a convex region of the input space. Competitive layers  cannot form classes with nonconvex regions or classes that are the union of  unconnected regions.  Some of the problems discussed in this section are solved by the feature  map and LVQ networks, which are introduced in later sections of this chap- ter, and the ART networks, which are presented in Chapter 19.  Competitive Layers in Biology  In previous chapters we have made no mention of how neurons are physi- cally organized within a layer  the topology of the network . In biological  neural networks, neurons are typically arranged in two-dimensional lay- ers, in which they are densely interconnected through lateral feedback. The  diagram to the left shows a layer of twenty-five neurons arranged in a two- dimensional grid.  16-10   neuron j -e -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  +1  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  -e  On-center off-surround  Mexican-Hat Function   16.19    16.20   16  Competitive Layers in Biology  Often weights vary as a function of the distance between the neurons they  connect. For example, the weights for Layer 2 of the Hamming network are  assigned as follows:  Eq.  16.20  assigns the same values as Eq.  16.19 , but in terms of the dis- tances    between neurons:  dij  wij  =       1  if i –  if i    j= j  .  wij  =       1  if dij –  if dij    0= 0  .  Either Eq.  16.19  or Eq.  16.20  will assign the weight values shown in the  diagram at left. Each neuron  is labeled with the value of the weight  ,  which comes from it to the neuron marked   wij  .  i  j  The term on-center off-surround is often used to describe such a connection  pattern between neurons. Each neuron reinforces itself  center , while in- hibiting all other neurons  surround .  It turns out that this is a crude approximation of biological competitive lay- ers. In biology, a neuron reinforces not only itself, but also those neurons  close to it. Typically, the transition from reinforcement to inhibition occurs  smoothly as the distance between neurons increases.  This transition is illustrated on the left side of Figure 16.7. This is a func- tion that relates the distance between neurons to the weight connecting  them. Those neurons that are close provide excitatory  reinforcing  connec- tions, and the magnitude of the excitation decreases as the distance in- creases. Beyond a certain distance, the neurons begin to have inhibitory  connections, and the inhibition increases as the distance increases. Be- cause of its shape, the function is referred to as the Mexican-hat function.  On the right side of Figure 16.7 is a two-dimensional illustration of the  Mexican-hat  on-center off-surround  function. Each neuron   is marked to  show the sign and relative strength of its weight    going to neuron   .  i  j  wij  neuron j - - - + - + - + - -  - - + + + + + - -  - - + - -  -  wij  +  -  dij  16-11  Figure 16.7  On-Center Off-Surround Layer in Biology   16 Competitive Networks  Biological competitive systems, in addition to having a gradual transition  between excitatory and inhibitory regions of the on-center off-surround  connection pattern, also have a weaker form of competition than the win- ner-take-all competition of the Hamming network. Instead of a single ac- tive neuron  winner , biological networks generally have “bubbles” of  activity that are centered around the most active neuron. This is caused in  part by the form of the on-center off-surround connectivity pattern and also  by nonlinear feedback connections.  See the discussion on contour enhance- ment in Chapter 18.   Self-Organizing Feature Maps  SOFM  In order to emulate the activity bubbles of biological systems, without hav- ing to implement the nonlinear on-center off-surround feedback connec- tions, Kohonen designed the following simplification. His self-organizing  feature map  SOFM  network first determines the winning neuron   us- ing the same procedure as the competitive layer.

It is possible to use a one-dimension- al arrangement, or even three or more dimensions. For a one-dimensional  SOFM, a neuron will only have two neighbors within a radius of 1  or a sin- gle neighbor if the neuron is at the end of the line . It is also possible to de- fine distance in different ways. For instance, Kohonen has suggested  rectangular and hexagonal neighborhoods for efficient implementation.  The performance of the network is not sensitive to the exact shape of the  neighborhoods.  16  2 2+  Now let’s demonstrate the performance of an SOFM network. Figure 16.9  shows a feature map and the two-dimensional topology of its neurons.

Each three-element weight vector is represented by a dot on the  sphere.  The weights are normalized, therefore they will fall on the surface  of a sphere.

We will randomly pick vectors in this region and present them to the fea- ture map.  Each time a vector is presented, the neuron with the closest weight vector  will win the competition. The winning neuron and its neighbors move their  weight vectors closer to the input vector  and therefore to each other . For  this example we are using a neighborhood with a radius of 1.  The weight vectors have two tendencies: first, they spread out over the in- put space as more vectors are presented; second, they move toward the  weight vectors of neighboring neurons. These two tendencies work together  to rearrange the neurons in the layer so that they evenly classify the input  space.

This usually occurs when two parts of the net fit the topology of sep- arate parts of the input space, but the net forms a twist between them. An  example is given in Figure 16.12.  16  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0  -0.2  -0.4  -0.6  -0.8  -1 -1  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0  -0.2  -0.4  -0.6  -0.8     1  -1 -1  -0.8  -0.6  -0.4  -0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  -0.8  -0.6  -0.4  -0.2  0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  Figure 16.12  Feature Map with a Twist  It is unlikely that this twist will ever be removed, because the two ends of  the net have formed stable classifications of different regions.  Improving Feature Maps So far, we have described only the most basic algorithm for training feature  maps. Now let’s consider several techniques that can be used to speed up  the self-organizing process and to make it more reliable.  One method to improve the performance of the feature map is to vary the  size of the neighborhoods during training. Initially, the neighborhood size,   is gradually reduced, until it only  d includes the winning neuron. This speeds up self-organizing and makes  twists in the map very unlikely.  , is set large. As training progresses,   d  The learning rate can also be varied over time. An initial rate of 1 allows  neurons to quickly learn presented vectors. During training, the learning  rate is decreased asymptotically toward 0, so that learning becomes stable.   16-15   16 Competitive Networks   We discussed the use of this technique for competitive layers earlier in the  chapter.  Another alteration that speeds self-organization is to have the winning  neuron use a larger learning rate than the neighboring neurons. Finally, both competitive layers and feature maps often use an alternative  expression for net input. Instead of using the inner product, they can di- rectly compute the distance between the input vector and the prototype  vectors. The advantage of using the distance is that input vectors do not  need to be normalized. This alternative net input expression is introduced  in the next section on LVQ networks. Other enhancements to the SOFM are described in Chapter 26, including  a batch version of the SOFM learning rule. That chapter is a case study of  using the SOFM for clustering.  To experiment with feature maps use the Neural Network Design Demon- strations 1-D Feature Maps  nnd14fm1  and 2-D Feature Maps  nnd14fm2 .  Learning Vector Quantization  The final network we will introduce in this chapter is the learning vector  quantization  LVQ  network, which is shown in Figure 16.13. The LVQ net- work is a hybrid network. It uses both unsupervised and supervised learn- ing to form classifications.  In the LVQ network, each neuron in the first layer is assigned to a class,  with several neurons often assigned to the same class. Each class is then  assigned to one neuron in the second layer. The number of neurons in the  first layer,  , will therefore always be at least as large as the number of  neurons in the second layer,   , and will usually be larger.

However, instead of computing the proximity of the input and  weight vectors by using the inner product, we will simulate the LVQ net- works by calculating the distance directly. One advantage of calculating  the distance directly is that vectors need not be normalized. When the vec- tors are normalized, the response of the network will be the same, whether  the inner product is used or the distance is directly calculated.  The net input of the first layer of the LVQ will be  1 ni  –=  w1 i  p–  ,   16.25   or, in vector form,  n1  –=  w1 1 w1 2  w1 S1  p– p–  p–  .  a1  =  compet n1    .  The output of the first layer of the LVQ is   16   16.26    16.27   Subclass  Therefore the neuron whose weight vector is closest to the input vector will  output a 1, and the other neurons will output 0.   Thus far, the LVQ network behaves exactly like the competitive network   at least for normalized vectors . There is a difference in interpretation,  however. In the competitive network, the neuron with the nonzero output  indicates which class the input vector belongs to. For the LVQ network, the  winning neuron indicates a subclass, rather than a class. There may be sev- eral different neurons  subclasses  that make up each class.  The second layer of the LVQ network is used to combine subclasses into a  single class.

A standard competitive layer has   16-17   16 Competitive Networks  the limitation that it can only create decision regions that are convex. The  LVQ network overcomes this limitation.  LVQ Learning The learning in the LVQ network combines competitive learning with su- pervision. As with all supervised learning algorithms, it requires a set of  examples of proper network behavior:    p1 t1   p2 t2        pQ tQ         .  Each target vector must contain only zeros, except for a single 1. The row  in which the 1 appears indicates the class to which the input vector be- longs. For example, if we have a problem where we would like to classify a  particular three-element vector into the second of four classes, we can ex- press this as          p1  =    t1  =  1 2 0 1 2  0 1 0 0  .           16.29   Before learning can occur, each neuron in the first layer is assigned to an  output neuron. This generates the matrix  . Typically, equal numbers of  hidden neurons are connected to each output neuron, so that each class can  be made up of the same number of convex regions. All elements of   are  set to zero, except for the following:  W2  W2  2 If hidden neuron i is to be assigned to class k, then set wki  1=  .   16.30   W2  Once  trained with a variation of the Kohonen rule.   is defined, it will never be altered.

First, as with competitive layers,  occasionally a hidden neuron in an LVQ network can have initial weight  values that stop it from ever winning the competition. The result is a dead  neuron that never does anything useful. This problem is solved with the  use of a “conscience” mechanism, a technique discussed earlier for compet- itive layers, and also presented in Exercise E16.4.  Secondly, depending on how the initial weight vectors are arranged, a neu- ron’s weight vector may have to travel through a region of a class that it  doesn’t represent, to get to a region that it does represent. Because the  weights of such a neuron will be repulsed by vectors in the region it must  cross, it may not be able to cross, and so it may never properly classify the  region it is being attracted to. This is usually solved by applying the follow- ing modification to the Kohonen rule.  If the winning neuron in the hidden layer incorrectly classifies the current  input, we move its weight vector away from the input vector, as before.  However, we also adjust the weights of the closest neuron to the input vec- tor that does classify it properly. The weights for this second neuron should  be moved toward the input vector.  When the network correctly classifies an input vector, the weights of only  one neuron are moved toward the input vector. However, if the input vector  is incorrectly classified, the weights of two neurons are updated, one weight  vector is moved away from the input vector, and the other one is moved to- ward the input vector. The resulting algorithm is called LVQ2.  LVQ2  To experiment with LVQ networks use the Neural Network Design Demon- strations LVQ1 Networks  nnd14lv1  and LVQ2 Networks  nnd14lv2 .  16-21   16 Competitive Networks  Summary of Results  Competitive Layer  Competitive Learning with the Kohonen Rule  wi    p q  +  1 –  1– q  1– q  wi  wi  wi  q   =  =  –        1– q   p q  +  wi  q   =  wi  1– q    i  ,  i  where   i   is the winning neuron.

The vectors in the diagram are to be classified  into one of three classes, according to their color.   Figure P16.13  Classification Problem  When the design is complete, draw a diagram showing the region  for each class.  We will begin by noting that since LVQ networks calculate the distance be- tween vectors directly, instead of using the inner product, they can classify  vectors that are not normalized, such as those above.  16  Next we will identify each color with a class:    Class 1 will include all white dots.    Class 2 will include all black dots.    Class 3 will include all blue dots.  Now we can choose the dimensions of the LVQ network. Since there are  three classes, the network must have three neurons in its output layer.  There are nine subclasses  i.e., clusters . Therefore the hidden layer must  have nine neurons. This gives us the network shown in Figure P16.14.

Now each neuron in the first layer will respond to a different cluster.  Next we choose  class. To do this we use the following rule:  W2   so that each subclass is connected to the appropriate   2 If subclass i is to be assigned to class  k, then set wki  1=  .  For example, the first subclass is the top-left cluster in the vector diagram.  The vectors in this cluster are white, so they belong in the first class. There- fore we should set    to one.  2  w1 1  Once we have done this for all nine subclasses we end up with these values:  W2  =  1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1  .  We can test the network by presenting a vector to it.

The  diagram of class regions and decision boundaries is shown in Figure  P16.15.  16  Figure P16.15  Class Regions and Decision Boundaries  P16.7 Competitive layers and feature maps require that input vectors be   normalized. But what if the available data is not normalized?  One way to handle such data is simply to normalize it before giving  it to the network. This has the disadvantage that the vector magni- tude information, which may be important, is lost.  Another solution is to replace the inner product expression usual- ly used to calculate net input,  with a direct calculation of distance,  a  =  compet Wp      ,  ni  –=  wi  p–   and   a  =  compet n    ,  as is done with the LVQ network. This works and saves the magni- tude information.  However, a third solution is to append a constant of 1 to each input  vector before normalizing it. Now the change in the added element  will preserve the vector magnitude information.  16-35   16 Competitive Networks  Normalize the following vectors using this last method:  First we add an extra element with value 1 to each vector.  Then we normalize each vector.  p1  =  ,   p2  =  ,   p3  =  1 1  1 1 1  0 1  0 1 1  .  0 0  0 0 1  p'1  =  ,   p'2  =  ,   p'3  =  p''1  =  p''2  =      1 1 1  0 1 1  1 1 1  0 1 1  =  =  1 1 1  3 3 3  0 2 2  1 1  p''3  =    0 0 1  0 0 1  =  0 0 1  Now the third element of each vector contains magnitude information,  since it is equal to the inverse of the magnitude of the extended vectors.  16-36   Epilogue  Epilogue  In this chapter we have demonstrated how the associative instar learning  rule of Chapter 15 can be combined with competitive networks, similar to  the Hamming network of Chapter 3, to produce powerful self-organizing  networks. By combining competition with the instar rule, each of the pro- totype vectors that are learned by the network become representative of a  particular class of input vector. Thus the competitive networks learn to di- vide their input space into distinct classes. Each class is represented by one  of the prototype vectors  rows of the weight matrix .  Three types of networks, all developed by Tuevo Kohonen, were discussed  in this chapter. The first is the standard competitive layer. Its simple oper- ation makes it a practical network for many problems.  The self-organizing feature map is very similar to the competitive layer,  but more closely models biological on-center off-surround networks. The re- sult is a network that not only learns to classify input vectors, but also  learns the topology of the input space.  The third network, the LVQ network, uses both unsupervised and super- vised learning to recognize clusters. It uses a second layer to combine mul- tiple convex regions into classes that can have any shape. LVQ networks  can even be trained to recognize classes made up of multiple unconnected  regions.  Chapters 18 and 19 will build on the networks presented in this chapter.  For example, Chapter 18 will carry out a more detailed examination of lat- eral inhibition, on-center off-surround networks and the biology that in- spired them. In Chapter 19 we discuss a modification to the standard  competitive network  called adaptive resonance theory , which solves the  weight stability problem that we discussed in this chapter.  Chapter 22 presents practical tips for training competitive networks, and  Chapter 26 is a case study of using self organizing feature maps on a real- world clustering problem.  16  16-37   16 Competitive Networks  Further Reading  [FrSk91]  J.

E16.4 Earlier in this chapter the term “conscience” was used to refer to a tech- nique for avoiding the dead neuron problem plaguing competitive layers  and LVQ networks.  Neurons that are too far from input vectors to ever win the competition can  be given a chance by using adaptive biases that get more negative each  time a neuron wins the competition. The result is that neurons that win  very often start to feel “guilty” until other neurons have a chance to win.  Figure E16.2 shows a competitive network with biases. A typical learning  rule for the bias    of neuron    is  i  bi  new bi  =  0.9bi old – bi  old, if i  i  0.2  , if i  i=  .        16-40   Exercises  Input  Competitive Layer  cid:0  W n cid:0  3 x 2  cid:0 b   cid:0  cid:0  a  cid:0  cid:0  3 x 1 C  cid:0  cid:0   3 x 1  p 2 x 1  1  2  3 x 1  3  a = compet  Wp + b   Figure E16.2  Competitive Layer with Biases  i.

As we saw in Chapter 11, multilayer networks with sigmoid  transfer functions in the hidden layers and linear transfer functions in the  output layer are universal function approximators. In this chapter we will  discuss another type of universal approximation network, the radial basis  function network. This network can be used for many of the same applica- tions as multilayer networks.  This chapter will follow the structure of Chapter 11. We will begin by dem- onstrating, in an intuitive way, the universal approximation capabilities of  the radial basis function network. Then we will describe three different  techniques for training these networks. They can be trained by the same  gradient-based algorithms discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, with deriva- tives computed using a form of backpropagation. However, they can also be  trained using a two-stage process, in which the first layer weights are com- puted independently from the weights in the second layer. Finally, these  networks can be built in an incremental way - one neuron at a time.  17-1   17 Radial Basis Networks  Theory and Examples  The radial basis function network is related to the multilayer perceptron  network of Chapter 11. It is also a universal approximator and can be used  for function approximation or pattern recognition. We will begin this chap- ter with a description of the network and a demonstration of its abilities for  function approximation and pattern recognition.  The original work in radial basis functions was performed by Powell and  others during the 1980’s [Powe87]. In this original work, radial basis func- tions were used for exact interpolation in a multidimensional space. In oth- er words, the function created by the radial basis interpolation was  required to pass exactly through all targets in the training set. The use of  radial basis functions for exact interpolation continues to be an important  application area, and it is also an active area of research.   For our purposes, however, we will not be considering exact interpolation.  Neural networks are often used on noisy data, and exact interpolation often  results in overfitting when the training data is noisy, as we discussed in  Chapter 13. Our interest is in the use of radial basis functions to provide  robust approximations to unknown functions based on generally limited  and noisy measurements. Broomhead and Lowe [BrLo88] were the first to  develop the radial basis function neural network model, which produces a  smooth interpolating function. No attempt is made to force the network re- sponse to exactly match target outputs. The emphasis is on producing net- works that will generalize well to new situations.  In the next section we will demonstrate the capabilities of the radial basis  function neural network. In the following sections we will describe proce- dures for training these networks.   Radial Basis Network  RBF  The radial basis network is a two-layer network. There are two major dis- tinctions between the radial basis function  RBF  network and a two layer  perceptron network. First, in layer 1 of the RBF network, instead of per- forming an inner product operation between the weights and the input   matrix multiplication , we calculate the distance between the input vector  and the rows of the weight matrix.  This is similar to the LVQ network  shown in Figure 16.13.  Second, instead of adding the bias, we multiply by  the bias. Therefore, the net input for neuron i in the first layer is calculated  as follows:  1 ni  =  p w1  i–  1 bi  .   17.1   17-2   Radial Basis Network  Each row of the weight matrix acts as a center point - a point where the net  input value will be zero. The bias performs a scaling operation on the trans- fer  basis  function, causing it to stretch or compress.   We should note that most papers and texts on RBF networks use the terms  standard deviation, variance or spread constant, rather than bias. We have  used the bias in order to maintain a consistency with other networks in this  text. This is simply a matter of notation and pedagogy. The operation of the  network is not affected. When a Gaussian transfer function is used, the  bias is related to the standard deviation as follows:   1  2  =  b      .    The transfer functions used in the first layer of the RBF network are dif- ferent than the sigmoid functions generally used in the hidden layers of  multilayer perceptrons  MLP . There are several different types of transfer  function that can be used  see [BrLo88] , but for clarity of presentation we  will consider only the Gaussian function, which is the one most commonly  used in the neural network community. It is defined as follows  e n2–=  ,  a   17.2   and it is plotted in Figure 17.1.   17  e n2–=  a  a  1.0  0.8   0.6   0.4   0.2   0     −3  17-3  −2  −1  1  2  3  0  n  Figure 17.1  Gaussian Basis Function  Local Function  Global Function  A key property of this function is that it is local. This means that the output  is close to zero if you move very far in either direction from the center point.  This is in contrast to the global sigmoid functions, whose output remains  close to 1 as the net input goes to infinity.   The second layer of the RBF network is a standard linear layer:  a2 W2a1 b2+  =   17.3    17 Radial Basis Networks  Figure 17.2 shows the complete RBF network.

To illustrate the capability of this  network, consider a network with two neurons in the hidden layer, one out- put neuron, and with the following default parameters:  1  w1 1  1–=  ,   1  w2 1  1=  ,   1 b1  2=  ,   1 b2  2=  ,  2  w1 1  1=  ,   2  w1 2  1=  ,   b2  0=  .  The response of the network with the default parameters is shown in Fig- ure 17.3, which plots the network output   is varied over  the range    as the input   a2  2  2–  p      .  Notice that the response consists of two hills, one for each of the Gaussian  neurons  basis functions  in the first layer. By adjusting the network pa- rameters, we can change the shape and location of each hill, as we will see  in the following discussion.  As you proceed through this example, it may  be helpful to compare the response of this sample RBF network with the  response of the sample MLP network in Figure 11.5.   17-4   Radial Basis Network  a2  2  1  0  2  1  0  2  1  0  −1 −2  −1  1  2  0  p  Figure 17.3  Default Network Response  Figure 17.4 illustrates the effects of parameter changes on the network re- sponse.

Figure 17.4  b  illustrates how the weights in the first layer determine the    17 Radial Basis Networks  location of the hills; there will be a hill centered at each first layer weight.  For multidimensional inputs there will be a hill centered at each row of the  weight matrix. For this reason, each row of the first layer weight matrix is  often called the center for the corresponding neuron  basis function .   Center  Notice that the effects of the weight and the bias in first layer of the RBF  network are much different than for the MLP network, which was shown  in Figure 11.6. In the MLP network, the sigmoid functions create steps.  The weights change the slopes of the steps, and the biases change the loca- tions of the steps.  Figure 17.4  c  illustrates how the weights in the second layer scale the  height of the hills. The bias in the second layer shifts the entire network  response up or down, as can be seen in Figure 17.4  d . The second layer of  the RBF network is the same type of linear layer used in the MLP network  of Figure 11.6, and it performs a similar function, which is to create a  weighted sum of the outputs of the layer 1 neurons.  This example demonstrates the flexibility of the RBF network for function  approximation. As with the MLP, it seems clear that if we have enough  neurons in the first layer of the RBF network, we can approximate virtual- ly any function of interest, and [PaSa93] provides a mathematical proof  that this is the case. However, although both MLP and RBF networks are  universal approximators, they perform their approximations in different  ways. For the RBF network, each transfer function is only active over a  small region of the input space - the response is local. If the input moves  far from a given center, the output of the corresponding neuron will be close  to zero. This has consequences for the design of RBF networks. We must  have centers adequately distributed throughout the range of the network  inputs, and we must select biases in such a way that all of the basis func- tions overlap in a significant way.  Recall that the biases change the width  of each basis function.  We will discuss these design considerations in more  detail in later sections.  To experiment with the response of this RBF network, use the MATLAB®  Neural Network Design Demonstration RBF Network Function  nnd17nf .  2 2+  Pattern Classification To illustrate the capabilities of the RBF network for pattern classification,  consider again the classic exclusive-or  XOR  problem. The categories for  the XOR gate are  Category 1:   p2  =    p3  =  , Category 2:   p1  =    p4  =      1– 1  1 1–          1– 1–  1 1  .      17-6   p2  p1  p4  p3  Radial Basis Network  The problem is illustrated graphically in the figure to the left. Because the  two categories are not linearly separable, a single-layer network cannot  perform the classification.  RBF networks can classify these patterns. In fact, there are many different  RBF solutions. We will consider one solution that demonstrates in a simple  way how to use RBF networks for pattern classification. The idea will be to  have the network produce outputs greater than zero when the input is near  patterns  , and outputs less than zero for all other inputs.  Note  that the procedures we will use to design this example network are not  suitable for complex problems, but they will help us illustrate the capabil- ities of the RBF network.    or   p3  p2  From the problem statement, we know that the network will need to have  two inputs and one output. For simplicity, we will use only two neurons in  the first layer  two basis functions , since this will be sufficient to solve the  XOR problem. As we discussed earlier, the rows of the first-layer weight  matrix will create centers for the two basis functions. We will choose the  centers to be equal to the patterns  . By centering a basis function  at each pattern, we can produce maximum network outputs there. The first  layer weight matrix is then   and   p2  p3  W1  =  T p2 T p3  =  1– 1 1 1–  .   17.5   17  The choice of the bias in the first layer depends on the width that we want  for each basis function. For this problem, we would like the network func- tion to have two distinct peaks at  . Therefore, we don’t want the  basis functions to overlap too much. The centers of the basis functions are  each a distance of   from the origin. We want the basis function to drop  significantly from its peak in this distance. If we use a bias of 1, we would  get the following reduction in that distance:   and   p2  p3  2  a  =  e n2–   – e 1  =  2  2  =  e 2–  =  0.1353  .   17.6   Therefore, each basis function will have a peak of 1 at the centers, and will  drop to 0.1353 at the origin. This will work for our problem, so we select the  first layer bias vector to be  b1  =  .  1 1   17.7   The original basis function response ranges from 0 to 1  see Figure 17.1 .  We want the output to be negative for inputs much different than   and  p3 , so we will use a bias of -1 for the second layer, and we will use a value   p2  17-7   17 Radial Basis Networks  of 2 for the second layer weights, in order to bring the peaks back up to 1.  The second layer weights and biases then become  W2  =  2 2  ,   b2  1–=  .   17.8   For the network parameter values given in  17.5 ,  17.7  and  17.8 , the net- work response is shown in Figure 17.5. This figure also shows where the  surface intersects the plane at  , which is where the decision takes  place. This is also indicated by the contours shown underneath the surface.  These are the function contours where  . They are almost circles that   vectors. This means that the network output will  surround the  be greater than 0 only when the input vector is near the   vectors.   and    and   0=  0=  p3  p2  a2  a2  p2  p3  2  1  p2  0  −1  −2  −3  −3  −2  0  −1  1  p1  3  2  Figure 17.5  Example 2-Input RBF Function Surface  Figure 17.6 illustrates more clearly the decision boundaries.

It is not the best  solution, in the sense that it does not always assign input patterns to the  closest prototype vector, unlike the MLP solution shown in Figure 11.2.  You will notice that the decision regions for this RBF network are circles,  unlike the linear boundaries that we see in single layer perceptrons. The  MLP can put linear boundaries together to create arbitrary decision re- gions. The RBF network can put circular boundaries together to create ar- bitrary decision regions. In this problem, the linear boundaries are more  efficient. Of course, when many neurons are used, and the centers are close  together, the elementary RBF boundaries are no longer purely circular,  and the elementary MLP boundaries are no longer purely linear. However,  associating circular boundaries with RBF networks and linear boundaries  with MLP networks can be helpful in understanding their operation as pat- tern classifiers.  To experiment with the RBF network for pattern classification, use the  MATLAB® Neural Network Design Demonstration RBF Pattern Classifica- tion  nnd17pc .  Now that we see the power of RBF networks for function approximation  and pattern recognition, the next step is to develop general training algo- rithms for these networks.  Global vs. Local Before we discuss the training algorithms, we should say a final word about  the advantages and disadvantages of the global transfer functions used by  the MLP networks and the local transfer functions used by the RBF net- works. The MLP creates a distributed representation, because all of the  transfer functions overlap in their activity. At any given input value, many   17-9   17 Radial Basis Networks  sigmoid functions in the first layer will have significant outputs. They must  sum or cancel in the second layer in order to produce the appropriate re- sponse at each point. In the RBF network, each basis function is only active  over a small range of the input. For any given input, only a few basis func- tions will be active.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. The global ap- proach tends to require fewer neurons in the hidden layer, since each neu- ron contributes to the response over a large part of the input space. For the  RBF network, however, basis centers must be spread throughout the range  of the input space in order to provide an accurate approximation. This leads  to the problem of the “curse of dimensionality,” which we will discuss in the  next section. Also, if more neurons, and therefore more parameters, are  used, then there is a greater likelihood that the network will overfit the  training data and fail to generalize well to new situations.  On the other hand, the local approach generally leads to faster training, es- pecially when the two-stage algorithms, which will be discussed in the next  section, are used. Also, the local approach can be very useful for adaptive  training, in which the network continues to be incrementally trained while  it is being used, as in adaptive filters  nonlinear versions of the filters in  Chapter 10  or controllers. If, for a period of time, training data only ap- pears in a certain region of the input space, then a global representation  will tend to improve its accuracy in those regions at the expense of its rep- resentation in other regions. Local representations will not have this prob- lem to the same extent. Because each neuron is only active in a small region  of the input space, its weights will not be adjusted if the input falls outside  that region.  Unlike the MLP network, which is almost always trained by some gradi- ent-based algorithm  steepest descent, conjugate gradient, Levenberg- Marquardt, etc. , the RBF network can be trained by a variety of approach- es.   RBF networks can be trained using gradient-based algorithms. However,  because of the local nature of the transfer function and the way in which  the first layer weights and biases operate, there tend to be many more un- satisfactory local minima in the error surfaces of RBF networks than in  those of MLP networks. For this reason, gradient-based algorithms are of- ten unsatisfactory for the complete training of RBF networks. They are  used on occasion, however, for fine-tuning of the network after it has been  initially trained using some other method. Later in this chapter we will dis- cuss the modifications to the backpropagation equations in Chapter 11 that  are needed to compute the gradients for RBF networks.  The most commonly used RBF training algorithms have two stages, which  treat the two layers of the RBF network separately. The algorithms differ   17-10  Training RBF Networks   Curse of Dimensionality  Training RBF Networks  mainly in how the first layer weights and biases are selected. Once the first  layer weights and biases have been selected, the second layer weights can  be computed in one step, using a linear least-squares algorithm. We will  discuss linear least squares in the next section.  The simplest of the two-stage algorithms arranges the centers  first layer  weights  in a grid pattern throughout the input range and then chooses a  constant bias so that the basis functions have some degree of overlap. This  procedure is not optimal, because the most efficient approximation would  place more basis functions in regions of the input space where the function  to be approximated is most complex. Also, for many practical cases the full  range of the input space is not used, and therefore many basis functions  could be wasted. One of the drawbacks of the RBF network, especially  when the centers are selected on a grid, is that they suffer from the curse  of dimensionality. This means that as the dimension of the input space in- creases, the number of basis functions required increases geometrically.  For example, suppose that we have one input variable, and we specify a  grid of 10 basis functions evenly spaced across the range of that input vari- able. Now, increase the number of input variables to 2. To maintain the  same grid coverage for both input variables, we would need 102, or 100 ba- sis functions.  Another method for selecting the centers is to select some random subset  of the input vectors in the training set. This ensures that basis centers will  be placed in areas where they will be useful to the network. However, due  to the randomness of the selection, this procedure is not optimal. A more  efficient approach is to use a method such as the Kohonen competitive lay- er or the feature map, described in Chapter 16, to cluster the input space.  The cluster centers then become basis function centers. This ensures that  the basis functions are placed in regions with significant activity. We will  discuss this method in a later section.  A final procedure that we will discuss for RBF training is called orthogonal  least squares. It is based on a general method for building linear models  called subset selection. This method starts with a large number of possible  centers—typically all of the input vectors from the training data. At each  stage of the procedure, it selects one center to add to the first layer weight.  The selection is based on how much the new neuron will reduce the sum  squared error. Neurons are added until some criteria is met. The criteria is  typically chosen to maximize the generalization capability of the network.  Linear Least Squares In this section we will assume that the first layer weights and biases of the  RBF network are fixed. This can be done by fixing the centers on a grid, or  by randomly selecting the centers from the input vectors in the training  data set  or by using the clustering method which is described in a later sec- tion . When the centers are randomly selected, all of the biases can be com- puted using the following formula [Lowe89]:  17-11  17   17 Radial Basis Networks  1 bi  =  S1 ---------- dmax  ,   17.9   dmax   is the maximum distance between neighboring centers. This is   where  designed to ensure an appropriate degree of overlap between the basis  functions. Using this method, all of the biases have the same value. There  are other methods which use different values for each bias. We will discuss  one such method later, in the section on clustering.  Once the first layer parameters have been set, the training of the second  layer weights and biases is equivalent to training a linear network, as in  Chapter 10. For example, consider that we have the following training  points  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ  {      ,  }  ,   17.10   pq   is an input to the network, and   where  output. The output of the first layer for each input  can be computed as  tq   is the corresponding target   in the training set   pq  1 ni q  =  pq w1  i–  1 bi  ,  1 aq  =  1 radbas nq    .   17.11    17.12    17.13    17.14    17.15   Since the first layer weights and biases will not be adjusted, the training  data set for the second layer then becomes  1 t2 a2 The second layer response is linear:  1 t1 a1            aQ       1 tQ    .  a2 W2a1 b2+  =  .  We want to select the weights and biases in this layer to minimize the sum  square error performance index over the training set:  F x   =    2– tq aq  T tq aq 2–     Q  q  1=  Our derivation of the solution to this linear least squares problem will fol- low the linear network derivation starting with Eq.  10.6 . To simplify the  discussion, we will assume a scalar target, and we will lump all of the pa- rameters we are adjusting, including the bias, into one vector:  17-12   Similarly, we include the bias input “1” as a component of the input vector  Training RBF Networks  x  =  w2 1 b2  .  zq  =  .  1 aq 1  2 aq  =  w2  1  1  Taq  b2+  ,  aq  =  xTzq  .

If we use regularization, as we discussed in Chapter 13, to help in prevent- ing overfitting, we obtain the following form for the performance index:   17.16    17.17    17.18    17.19    17.22    17.23   17-13   17 Radial Basis Networks  F x   =  t Ux –  T t Ux  –  =  t Ux –  T t Ux  –   xTx +  ,   17.24   n  +    2 xi  i  1=  where     =      from Eq.  13.4 .

We are  left with two possibilities. If the Hessian matrix has only positive eigenval- ues, the performance index will have one unique global minimum  see Fig- ure 8.7 . If the Hessian matrix has some zero eigenvalues, the performance  index will either have a weak minimum  see Figure 8.9  or no minimum   see Problem P8.7 , depending on the vector  minimum, since   .

We will use an RBF network with three neurons  in the first layer to approximate the following function  Example     ---p  4  g p   =  1  sin+   for   2–     p  2  .   17.32   To obtain our training set we will evaluate this function at six values of   p  :  This produces the targets  p  =     2–   1.2–  0.4–    0.4 1.2 2        .  t  =     0 0.19 0.69 1.3 1.8 2            .   17.33    17.34   17  We will choose the basis function centers to be spaced equally throughout  the input range: -2, 0 and 2.

For example, if we select six basis functions and six  data points, and if we choose the first layer biases to be 8, instead of 0.5,  then the network response will be as shown in Figure 17.8. The spread of  the basis function decreases as the inverse of the bias. When the bias is this  large, there is not sufficient overlap in the basis functions to provide a  smooth approximation. We match each data point exactly. However, be- cause of the local nature of the basis function, the approximation to the  true function is not accurate between the training data points.  17  Training RBF Networks  2.5  1.5  2  1  0  0.5  −0.5  −1  −1.5 −1  1  0.5  0 −1  a2  a1  1.5  0.5  2  1  0  −0.5  −1 −2  1  0.5  0 −2  a2  a1  1  1  2  2  −1.5  −1  −0.5  0  0.5  −1.5  −1  −0.5  0.5  0  p  1  1  1.5  1.5  Figure 17.8  RBF Response with Bias Too Large  17-17   17 Radial Basis Networks  To experiment with the linear least squares fitting, use the MATLAB® Neu- ral Network Design Demonstration RBF Linear Least Squares  nnd17lls .  Orthogonal Least Squares In the previous section we assumed that the weights and biases in the first  layer were fixed.  For example, the centers could be fixed on a grid, or ran- domly selected from the input vectors in the training set.  In this section  we consider a different approach for selecting the centers. We will assume  that there exists a number of potential centers. These centers could include  the entire set of input vectors in the training set, vectors chosen in a grid  pattern, or vectors chosen by any other procedure one might think of. We  will then select vectors one at a time from this set of potential centers, until  the network performance is satisfactory. We will build up the network one  neuron at a time.  The basic idea behind this method comes from statistics, and it is called  subset selection [Mill90]. The general objective of subset selection is to  choose an appropriate subset of independent variables to provide the most  efficient prediction of a target dependent variable. For example, suppose  that we have 10 independent variables, and we want to use them to predict  our target dependent variable. We want to create the simplest predictor  possible, so we want to use the minimum number of independent variables  for the prediction. Which subset of the 10 independent variables should we  use? The optimal approach, called an exhaustive search, tries all combina- tions of subsets and finds the smallest one that provides satisfactory per- formance.  We will define later what we mean by satisfactory  performance.   Unfortunately, this strategy is not practical. If we have Q variables in our  original set, the following expression gives the number of distinct subsets:  Q    q  1=  Q!  ------------------------- ! q! Q q–    .   17.43   Q  Q  10=  20=  , this number is 1023. If   If  , the number is more than 1 mil- lion. We need to have a less expensive strategy than the exhaustive search.  There are several suboptimal procedures. They are not guaranteed to find  the optimal subset, but they require significantly less computation. One  procedure is called forward selection. This method begins with an empty  model and then adds variables one at a time. At each stage, we add the in- dependent variable that provides the largest reduction in squared error.  We stop adding variables when the performance is adequate. Another ap- proach, called backward elimination, starts with all independent variables  selected for the model. At each stage we eliminate the variable that would  cause the least increase in the squared error. The process continues until  the performance is inadequate. There are other approaches which combine   17-18  Subset Selection  Forward Selection  Backward Elimination   Training RBF Networks  forward selection and backward elimination, so that variables can be added  and deleted at each iteration.  Any of the standard subset selection techniques can be used for selecting  RBF centers. For purposes of illustration, we will consider one specific form  of forward selection, called orthogonal least squares [ChCo91]. Its main  feature is that it efficiently calculates the error reduction provided by the  addition of each potential center to the RBF network.  To develop the orthogonal least squares algorithm, we begin with Eq.   17.22 , repeated here in slightly different form:  t  =  Ux  e+  .   17.44   We will use our standard notation for matrix rows and columns to individ- ually identify both the rows and the columns of the matrix U:  U  =  =  u1 u2  un   17.45   1  uT T z1 uT T z2 2   T uT zQ  =  Q  U  Here each row of the matrix   represents the output of layer 1 of the RBF  network for one input vector from the training set. There will be a column  of the matrix U for each neuron  basis function  in layer 1 plus the bias term     . Note that for the OLS algorithm, the potential centers for the  n basis functions are often chosen to be all of the input vectors in the training  set. In this case,  , since the constant “1” for the bias term  z is included in   n , as shown in Eq.  17.17 .   will equal   Q 1+  1+  S1  =  Eq.  17.44  is in the form of a standard linear regression model. The matrix  U  are called the re- gressor vectors.   is called the regression matrix, and the columns of   U  The objective of OLS is to determine how many columns of  neurons or basis functions  should be used. The first step is to calculate  how much each potential column would reduce the squared error. The prob- lem is that the columns are generally correlated with each other, and so it  is difficult to determine how much each individual column would reduce  the error. For this reason, we need to first orthogonalize the columns. Or- thogonalizing the columns means that we can decompose     numbers of    as follows:  U  U  U MR  =  ,   17.46   where   R   is an upper triangular matrix, with ones on the diagonal:  17-19  17  Regression Matrix   17 Radial Basis Networks  R  =  r1 3  r1 n 1 r1 2 0 1 r2 3  r2 n   0 0 0 0  0  rn 1– 0  1    n  ,   17.47    17.49    17.50    17.51    17.52   M  and  the following properties:   is a matrix with orthogonal columns   mi  .

Since   R  x  There are a number of ways to obtain the orthogonal vectors  will use the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process of Eq.  5.20 , starting  with the original columns of   , but we   mi  .

Using Eq.   17.49 , the total sum square value of the targets is given by  U  tTt  =    Mh e+  T Mh e+      =  hTMTMh eTMh hTMTe  +  +  +  eTe  .   17.56   Consider the second term in the sum:  eTMh If we use the optimal   = h   from Eq.  17.51 , we find  t Mh –  TMh  =  tTMh hTMTMh  –  .   17.57   eTMh  =  tTMh  –  tTMV 1– MTMh  =  tTMh  –  tTMh  =  0  .   17.58   Therefore the total sum square value from Eq.  17.56  becomes  17  tTt  =  hTMTMh eTe  +  =  hTVh eTe  +  =  2mi hi  Tmi  +  eTe  .   17.59   n    i  1=  The first term on the right of Eq.  17.59  is the contribution to the sum  squared value explained by the regressors, and the second term is the re- maining sum squared value that is not explained by the regressors. There- fore, regressor  basis function     contributes   i  2mi hi  Tmi   17.60   to the squared value. This also represents how much the squared error can  be reduced by including the corresponding basis function in the network.  We will use this number, after normalizing by the total squared value, to  determine the next basis function to include at each iteration:  oi  =  2mi Tmi hi -------------------- tTt  .   17.61   This number always falls between zero and one.  17-21   17 Radial Basis Networks  Now let’s put all these ideas together into an algorithm for selecting cen- ters.

Clustering There is another approach [MoDa89] for selecting the weights and biases  in the first layer of the RBF network. This method uses the competitive net- works described in Chapter 16. Recall that the competitive layer of Ko- honen  see Figure 16.2  and the Self Organizing Feature Map  see Figure   17-23   17 Radial Basis Networks  16.9  perform a clustering operation on the input vectors of the training set.  After training, the rows of the competitive networks contain prototypes, or  cluster centers. This provides an approach for locating centers and select- ing biases for the first layer of the RBF network. If we take the input vec- tors from the training set and perform a clustering operation on them, the  resulting prototypes  cluster centers  could be used as centers for the RBF  network. In addition, we could compute the variance of each individual  cluster and use that number to calculate an appropriate bias to be used for  the corresponding neuron.  Consider again the following training set:  p1 t1 { , }    {  p2 t2  , }   pQ tQ  {      ,  }  .  We want to perform a clustering of the input vectors from this training set:   17.76    17.77     p1 p2   pQ          .  We will train the first layer weights of the RBF network to perform a clus- tering of these vectors, using the Kohonen learning rule of Eq.  16.13 , and  repeated here:  w1  q   i  =  w1 i  1– q    p q  +    –  w1  i  1– q      ,   17.78   p q    is one of the input vectors in the training set, and   where   is  the weight vector that was closest to  .  We could also use other cluster- ing algorithms, such as the Self Organizing Feature Map, or the k-means  clustering algorithm, which was suggested in [MoDa89].  As described in  Chapter 16, Eq.  17.78  is repeated until the weights have converged. The  resulting converged weights will represent cluster centers of the training  set input vectors. This will insure that we will have basis functions located  in areas where input vectors are most likely to occur.  1– q  p q   i    w1  In addition to selecting the first layer weights, the clustering process can  provide us with a method for determining the first layer biases. For each  neuron  basis function , locate the   input vectors from the training set  that are closest to the corresponding weight vector  center . Then compute  the average distance between the center and its neighbors.  nc  disti  =  i w1 pj i–  1 ----- nc  nc      j  1=  1 --- 2   2     17.79   i p1   is the input vector that closest to   where   the next closest  input vector. From these distances, [MoDa89] recommends setting the first  layer biases as follows:  , and is   w1 i  i p2  17-24   Training RBF Networks  1 bi  =  1 ------------------ 2disti  .   17.80   Therefore, when a cluster is wide, the corresponding basis function will be  wide as well. Notice that in this case each bias in the first layer will be dif- ferent. This should provide a network that is more efficient in its use of ba- sis functions than a network with equal biases.  After the weights and biases of the first layer are determined, linear least  squares is used to find the second layer weights and biases.  There is a potential drawback to the clustering method for designing the  first layer of the RBF network. The method only takes into account the dis- tribution of the input vectors; it does not consider the targets. It is possible  that the function we are trying to approximate is more complex in regions  for which there are fewer inputs. For this case, the clustering method will  not distribute the centers appropriately. On the other hand, one would  hope that the training data is located in regions where the network will be  most used, and therefore the function approximation will be most accurate  in those areas.  Nonlinear Optimization It is also possible to train RBF networks in the same manner as MLP net- works—using nonlinear optimization techniques, in which all weights and  biases in the network are adjusted at the same time. These methods are not  generally used for the full training of RBF networks, because these net- works tend to have many more unsatisfactory local minima in their error  surfaces. However, nonlinear optimization can be used for the fine-tuning  of the network parameters, after initial training by one of the two-stage  methods we presented in earlier sections.  We will not present the nonlinear optimization methods in their entirety  here, since they were treated extensively in Chapters 11 and 12. Instead,  we will simply indicate how the basic backpropagation algorithm for com- puting the gradient in MLP networks can be modified for RBF networks.  The derivation of the gradient for RBF networks follows the same pattern  as the gradient development for MLP networks, starting with Eq.  11.9 ,  which you may wish to review at this time. Here we will only discuss the  one step where the two derivations differ. The difference occurs with Eq.   11.20 . The net input for the second layer of the RBF network has the same  form as its counterpart in the MLP network, but the first layer net input  has a different form  as given in Eq.  17.1  and repeated here :  1 ni  =  p w1  i–  1 bi  =  1 bi    1– pj wi j  2  .   17.81   S1   j  1=  17-25  17   17 Radial Basis Networks  If we take the derivative of this function with respect to the weights and  biases, we obtain  1 ni ----------- 1 wi j  =  1 bi  1– ---------------------------------------2 pj wi j      1–    =  1 2  1  1 wi j   pj– bi ----------------------------- p w1 i–  ,    17.82   This produces the modified gradient equations  compare with Eq.  11.23   and Eq.  11.24   for Layer 1 of the RBF network  S1   j  1=    1– pj wi j  2  1 ni -------- 1 bi  =  p w1  i–  .

Other Training Techniques In this chapter we have only touched the surface of the variety of training  techniques that have been proposed for RBF networks. We have attempted  to present the principal concepts, but there are many variations. For exam- ple, the OLS algorithm has been extended to handle multiple outputs  [ChCo92] and regularized performance indices [ChCh96]. It has also been  used in combination with a genetic algorithm [ChCo99], which was used to  select the first layer biases and the regularization parameter. The expecta- tion maximization algorithm has also been suggested by several authors  for optimizing the center locations, starting with [Bish91]. [OrHa00] used  a regression tree approach for center selection. There have also been many  variations on the use of clustering and on the combination of clustering for  initialization and nonlinear optimization for fine-tuning. The architecture  of the RBF network lends itself to many training approaches.   17-26   Summary of Results  Summary of Results  Radial Basis Network  Inputs  Radial Basis Layer  Linear Layer  W1  S 1 x R  p1  R x 11  dist  1  R 1  b1  S 1 x 1  n1  S 1 x 1  .*  a1  S 1 x 1  1  S 1  W2  S 2 x S 1  b2  S 2 x 1  a2  S 2 x 1  n2  S 2 x 1  S 2  1  a  i  =  radbas     1  -  w p i  b  1     i  2  a W a b  =  +  2  1  2  Training RBF Networks  Linear Least Squares  17  x  =  ,   zq  =  w2 1 b2  1 aq 1  t  =  ,   U  =  ,   e  =  t1 t2  tQ  uT T z1 1 uT T z2 2   T uT zQ  =  Q  e1 e2  eQ  F x   =  t Ux –  T t Ux  –   xTx +    UTU I+  x  =  UTt  17-27   17 Radial Basis Networks  Orthogonal Least Squares  Step 1  i  m1  ui=  ,  i  h1  =  i Tt m1 ---------------------- i Tm1 i  m1  ,  i  o1  =  2m1 i Tm1 i  i   h1 ------------------------------------- tTt  .  o1  =    i1 o1  =  i  max o1      i1 m1 m1  =    =  ui1  .

This means that the error would be reduced by 8.04%, if the first  or fifth center were used in a single-neuron first layer. We would typically  select the first center, since it has the smallest index.  0=  , since the bias center,   If we stop at this point, we would add the first center to the hidden layer.

The sequence of re- ductions would be 0.0804, 0.3526, 0.5074, 0.0448, 0.0147, 0, and the centers  would be chosen in the following order: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6. The reason that re- ductions in later iterations are higher is that it takes a combination of basis  functions to produce the best approximation. This is why forward selection  is not guaranteed to produce the optimal combination, which can be found  with an exhaustive search. Also, notice that the bias is selected last, and it  produces no reduction in the error.   P17.2 Figure P17.1 illustrates a classification problem, where Class I vec- tors are represented by dark circles, and Class II vectors are rep- resented by light circles. These categories are not linearly  separable. Design a radial basis function network to correctly clas- sify these categories.  Figure P17.1  Classification Problem for Problem P17.2  From the problem statement, we know that the network will need to have  two inputs, and we can use one output to distinguish the two classes. We  will choose a positive output for Class I vectors, and a negative output for  Class II vectors. The Class I region is made up of two simple subregions,  and it appears that two neurons should be sufficient to perform the classi- fication. The rows of the first-layer weight matrix will create centers for the  two basis functions, and we will choose each center to be located in the mid- dle of one subregion. By centering a basis function in each subregion, we  can produce maximum network outputs there. The first layer weight ma- trix is then  W1  =  1  1 2.5 2.5  .  The choice of the biases in the first layer depends on the width that we  want for each basis function. For this problem, the first basis function  should be wider than the second. Therefore, the first bias will be smaller  than the second bias. The boundary formed by the first basis function   17-32   Solved Problems  should have a radius of approximately 1, while the second basis function  boundary should have a radius of approximately  . We want the basis  functions to drop significantly from their peaks in these distances. If we use  a bias of 1 for the first neuron and a bias of 2 for the second neuron, we get  the following reductions within one radius of the centers:  1 2  a  =  e n2–  =    e 1 1 –  2  =  e 1–  =  0.3679  ,   a  =  e n2–  =      – e 2 0.5  2  =  e 1–  =  0.3679  This will work for our problem, so we select the first layer bias vector to be  b1  =  .  1 2  The original basis function response ranges from 0 to 1  see Figure 17.1 .  We want the output to be negative for inputs outside the decision regions,  so we will use a bias of -1 for the second layer, and we will use a value of 2  for the second layer weights, in order to bring the peaks back up to 1. The  second layer weights and biases then become  W2  =  2 2  ,   b2  1–=  .  For these network parameter values, the network response is shown on the  right side of Figure P17.2.

In this chapter we have demonstrated the operation of the RBF  network, and we have described several techniques for training the net- work. Unlike MLP training, RBF training usually consists of two stages. In  the first stage, the weights and biases in the first layer are found. In the  second stage, which typically involves linear least squares, the second layer  weights and biases are calculated.  17  17-35   17 Radial Basis Networks  Further Reading  [Bish91]  [BrLo88]  [ChCo91]  [ChCo92]  [ChCh96]  [ChCo99]  C.

The Grossberg network  described in this chapter is a self-organizing continuous-time competitive  network. This will be the first time we have considered continuous-time re- current networks, and we will introduce concepts here that will be further  explored in Chapters 20 and 21. This Grossberg network is also the foun- dation for the adaptive resonance theory  ART  networks that we will  present in Chapter 19.  We will begin with a discussion of the biological motivation for the Gross- berg network: the human visual system. Although we will not cover this  material in any depth, the Grossberg networks are so heavily influenced by  biology that it is difficult to discuss his networks without putting them in  their biological context. It is also important to note that biology provided  the original inspirations for the field of artificial neural networks, and we  should continue to look for inspiration there, as scientists continue to de- velop new understanding of brain function.  18-1   18 Grossberg Network  Theory and Examples  During the late 1960s and the 1970s the number of researchers in the field  of neural networks dropped dramatically. There were, however, a number  of researchers who continued to work during this period, including Tuevo  Kohonen, James Anderson, Kunihiko Fukushima and Shun-ichi Amari,  among others. One of the most prolific was Stephen Grossberg.   Grossberg has been continuously active, and highly productive, in neural  network research since the early 1960s. His work is characterized by the  use of nonlinear mathematics to model specific functions of mind and  brain, and his volume of output has been consistent with the magnitude of  the task of understanding the brain. The topics of his papers have ranged  from such specific areas as how competitive networks can provide contrast  enhancement in vision, to such general subjects as a universal theory for  human memory.   In part because of the scale of his efforts, his work has a reputation for dif- ficulty. Each new paper is built on a foundation of 30 years of previous re- sults, and is therefore difficult to assess on its own merits. In addition, his  terminology is self-consistent, but not in standard use by other researchers.  His work is also characterized by a high level of mathematical and neuro- physiological sophistication. He is inspired by the interdisciplinary re- search into brain function by Helmholtz, Maxwell and Mach, and he brings  this viewpoint to his work. His research lies at the intersection of mathe- matics, psychology and neurophysiology. A lack of background in these ar- eas can make his work difficult to approach on a first reading.  This chapter will take a rudimentary look at one of the seminal networks  developed by Grossberg. In order to obtain the maximum understanding of  his ideas, we will begin with a brief introduction to the biological motiva- tion for the network: the visual system. Then we will present the mathe- matical building block for many of Grossberg’s networks: the shunting  model. After understanding the function of this simple model, we will dem- onstrate how it can be used to build a neural network for adaptive pattern  recognition. This network will then form the basis for the adaptive reso- nance theory networks that are discussed in Chapter 19. By building up  gradually to the more complex networks, we hope to make them more eas- ily understandable.  There is an important lesson we should take from the work described in  this chapter. Although the original inspiration for the field of artificial neu- ral networks came from biology, at times we forget to look back to biology  for new ideas. It will be the blending of biology, mathematics, psychology  and other disciplines that will provide the maximum growth in our under- standing of neural networks.  18-2   Biological Motivation: Vision  Biological Motivation: Vision  The neural network described in this chapter was inspired by the develop- mental physiology of the human visual system. In this section we want to  provide a brief introduction to vision, so that the function of the network  will be more understandable.   In Figure 18.1 we have a schematic representation of the first stages of the  visual system. Light passes through the cornea  the transparent front part  of the eye  and the lens, which bends the light to focus objects on the retina   the interior layer of the external wall of the eye . It is after the light falls  on the retina that the immense job of translating this information into an  understandable image begins. As we will see later in this chapter, much of  what we “see” is not actually present in the image projected onto the retina.  Bipolar Cell  Amacrine   Cell  Ganglion Cell  Optic Nerve  Cone  Rod  Horizontal  Cell  Optic Nerve Fiber  Light  Lens  Retina  18  Figure 18.1  Eyeball and Retina  Retina  Rods Cones  The retina is actually a part of the brain. It becomes separated from the  brain during fetal development, but remains connected to it through the  optic nerve. The retina consists of three layers of nerve cells. The outer lay- er consists of the photoreceptors  rods and cones , which convert light into  electrical signals. The rods allow us to see in dim light, whereas the cones  allow us to see fine detail and color. For reasons not completely understood,  light must pass through the other two layers of the retina in order to stim- ulate the rods and cones. As we will see later, this obstruction must be com- pensated for in neural processing, in order to reconstruct recognizable  images.  Bipolar Cells  The middle layer of the retina consists of three types of cells: bipolar cells,  horizontal cells and amacrine cells. Bipolar cells receive input from the re- ceptors and feed into the third layer of the retina, containing the ganglion   18-3   18 Grossberg Network  Horizontal Cells Amacrine Cells  cells. Horizontal cells link the receptors and the bipolar cells, and amacrine  cells link bipolar cells with the ganglion cells.  Ganglion Cells  Visual Cortex  The final layer of the retina contains the ganglion cells. The axons of the  ganglion cells pass across the surface of the retina and collect in a bundle  to form the optic nerve. It is interesting to note that each eye contains  roughly 125 million receptors, but only 1 million ganglion cells. Clearly  there is significant processing done in the retina to perform data reduction.  The axons of the ganglion cells, bundled into the optic nerve, connect to an  area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, as illustrated in Fig- ure 18.2. From this point the fibers fan out into the primary visual cortex,  located at the back of the brain. The axons of the ganglion cells make syn- apses with lateral geniculate cells, and the axons of the lateral geniculate  cells make synapses with cells in the visual cortex. The visual cortex is the  region of the brain devoted to visual function and consists of many layers  of cells.  Lateral Geniculate Nucleus  Primary Visual Cortex  Retina  Figure 18.2  Visual Pathway  The connections along the visual pathway are far from random. The map- ping from each layer to the next is highly organized. The axons from the  ganglion cells in a certain part of the retina go to cells in a particular part  of the lateral geniculate, which in turn go to a particular part of the visual  cortex.  This topographic mapping was one of the inspirations for the self- organizing feature map described in Chapter 14.  In addition, as we can see  in Figure 18.2, each hemisphere of the brain receives input from both eyes,  since half of the optic nerve fibers cross and the other half stay uncrossed.  It turns out that the left half of each visual field ends up in the right half  of the brain, and the right half of each visual field ends up in the left half  of the brain.  Illusions We now have some idea of the general structure of the visual pathway, but  how does it function? What is the purpose of the three layers of the retina?  What operations are performed by the lateral geniculate? Some hints to the   18-4   Biological Motivation: Vision  answers to these questions can be obtained by investigating visual illu- sions.  Why are there so many visual illusions? Mechanisms that overcome imper- fections of the retinal uptake process imply illusions. Grossberg and others  have used the vast store of known illusions to probe adaptive perceptual  mechanisms [GrMi89]. If we can develop mathematical models that pro- duce the same illusions the biological system does, then we may have a  mechanism that describes how this part of the brain works. To help us un- derstand why illusions exist, we will first consider some of the imperfec- tions of the retinal uptake process.  Figure 18.3 is the view of the retina that an ophthalmologist has when  looking into the eye through the cornea. The large pale circle is the optic  disk, where the optic nerve leaves the retina on its way to the lateral gen- iculate. This is also where arteries enter and veins leave the retina. The op- tic disk causes a blind spot in our vision, as we will discuss in a moment.  The darker disk to the right of the optic disk is the fovea, which constitutes  the center of our field of vision. This is a region of the retina, about half a  millimeter in diameter, that contains only cones. Although cones are dis- tributed throughout the retina, they are most densely packed in the fovea.  In addition, in this area of the retina the other layers are displaced to the  side, so that the cones lie at the front. The densely packed photoreceptors,  and the lack of obstruction, give us our best fine-detail vision at the fovea,  which allows us to precisely focus the lens.  Optic Disk  Fovea  Optic Disk  Blind Spot   Vein  18  Fovea  Figure 18.3  Back of the Eye  from [John01]   From Figure 18.3 we can see that there are a number of imperfections in  retinal uptake. First, there are no rods and cones in the optic disk, which  leaves a blind spot in our field of vision. We are not normally aware of the  blind spot because of processing done in the visual pathway, but we can  identify it with a simple test. Look at the blue circle on the left side of Fig- ure 18.4, while covering your left eye. As you move your head closer to the  page, then farther away, you will notice a point  about nine inches away    18-5   18 Grossberg Network  at which the circle on the right will disappear from your field of vision.  You  are still looking at the circle on the left.  If you haven’t tried this before, it  can be a little disconcerting. The interesting thing is that we don’t see our  blind spot as a black hole. Somehow our brains fill in the missing region.  Figure 18.4  Test for the Blind Spot  Other imperfections in the retinal uptake are the arteries and veins that  cross in front of the photoreceptors at the back of the retina. These obstruct  the rods and cones from receiving all of the light in the visual field. In ad- dition, because the photoreceptors are at the back of the retina, light must  pass through the other two layers to reach them.  Figure 18.5 illustrates the effect of these imperfections. Here we see an  edge displayed on the retina. The drawing on the right illustrates the im- age initially perceived by the photoreceptors. The regions covered by the  blind spot and the veins are not observed by the rods and cones.  The rea- son we do not “see” the arteries, veins, etc., is that the vision pathway does  not respond to stabilized images. The eyeballs are constantly jerking, in  what are called saccadic movements, so that even fixed objects in our field  of vision are moving relative to the eye. The veins are fixed relative to the  eyeball, so they fade from our vision.   Edge  Retina  Vein  Blind Spot  Stabilized Images Fade  Emergent Segmentation Featural Filling-in  Figure 18.5  Perception of an Edge on the Retina  after [Gros90]   Because we do not see edges as displayed on the right side of Figure 18.5,  the neural systems in our visual pathway must be performing some opera- tion that compensates for the distortions and completes the image. Gross- berg suggests [GrMi89] that there are two primary types of compensatory  processing involved. The first, which he calls emergent segmentation, com- pletes missing boundaries. The second, which he calls featural filling-in,  fills in the color and brightness inside the resulting boundaries. These two  processes are illustrated in Figure 18.6. In the top figure we see an edge as  it is originally perceived by the rods and cones, with missing sections. In   18-6   Biological Motivation: Vision  the lower figure we see the completed edge, after the emergent segmenta- tion and featural filling-in.  Before Processing  After Processing  Emergent Segmentation  Featural Filling-in  Figure 18.6  Compensatory Processing  after [Gros90]   If the processing along the visual pathway is recreating missing parts of  the images we see, there must be times when it makes mistakes, since it  cannot know exactly those parts of a scene from which it receives no light.  These mistakes are illustrated by visual illusions. Consider, for example,  the two figures in the left margin. In the top figure you should be able to  see a bright white triangle lying on top of several other black objects. In  fact, no such triangle exists in the figure. It is purely a creation of the emer- gent segmentation and featural filling-in process of your visual system.  The same is true of the bright white circle which appears to lie on top of the  lines in the lower-left figure.  The featural filling-in process is also demonstrated in Figure 18.7. This il- lusion is called neon color spreading [vanT75]. In the diagram on the right  you may be able to see light blue diamonds, or even wide light blue lines  criss-crossing the figure. In the diagram on the left you may be able to see  a light blue ring. The blue you see filling in the diamonds and the ring is  not a result of the color having been smeared during the printing process,  nor is it caused by the scattering of light. This effect does not appear on the  retina at all. It does not exist, except in your brain.  The perception of neon  color spreading can vary from individual to individual, and the strength of  the perception is dependent on the colors used. If you do not notice the ef- fect in Figure 18.7, look at the cover of any issue of the journal Neural Net- works, Pergamon Press.   Later in this chapter we will discuss some neural network models that can  help to explain the processes that implement emergent segmentation, as  well as other visual phenomena.  18  18-7   18 Grossberg Network  Brightness Constancy Brightness Contrast  Figure 18.7  Neon Color Spreading  Featural Filling In   Vision Normalization In addition to emergent segmentation and featural filling-in, there are two  other phenomena that give us an indication of what operations are being  performed in the early vision system: brightness constancy and brightness  contrast. The brightness constancy effect is evidenced by the test illustrat- ed in Figure 18.8. In this test a subject is shown a small grey disk inside a  darker grey annulus, which is illuminated by white light of a certain inten- sity. The subject is asked to indicate the brightness of the central disk by  looking at a series of grey disks, separately illuminated, and selecting the  disk with the same brightness. Next, the brightness of the light illuminat- ing the grey disk and dark annulus is increased, and the subject is again  asked to select the disk with the same brightness. This process is repeated  for several different levels of illumination. It turns out that in each case the  subject will choose the same disk as matching the original central disk.  Even though the total light entering the subject’s eye is 10 to 100 times  brighter, it is only the relative brightness that registers.  Variable  Illumination  Separate  Constant Illumination  Figure 18.8  Test of Brightness Constancy  after [Gros90]   18-8   Basic Nonlinear Model  Another phenomenon of the vision system, which is closely related to  brightness constancy, is brightness contrast. This effect is illustrated by  the two figures in the left margin. At the centers of the two figures we have  two small disks with equivalent grey scale. The small disk in the top figure  is surrounded by a darker annulus, while the small disk in the lower figure  is surrounded by a lighter annulus. Even though both disks have the same  grey scale, the one inside the darker annulus appears brighter. This is be- cause our vision system is sensitive to relative intensities. It would seem  that the total activity across the image is held constant.   The properties of brightness constancy and brightness contrast are very  important to our vision system. Since we see things in so many different  lighting conditions, if we were not able to compensate for the absolute in- tensity of a scene, we would never learn to recognize things. Grossberg calls  this process of normalization “discounting the illuminant.”   In the rest of this chapter we want to present a neural network architecture  that is consistent with the physical phenomena discussed in this section.  Basic Nonlinear Model  Leaky Integrator  Before we introduce the Grossberg network, we will begin by looking at  some of the building blocks that make up the network. The first building  block is the “leaky” integrator, which is shown in Figure 18.9. The basic  equation for this system is  Time Constant  where      is the system time constant.   18.1   18  dn t    ------------ dt  =  –  n t     +  p t     ,  p  +  -  Leaky Integrator  n  . n   cid:0 1 ε  cid:0  ε dn dt = - n + p  Figure 18.9  Leaky Integrator  The response of the leaky integrator to an arbitrary input   p t    is  n t     =  e t –  n 0     –     – e t  p     d  .  t  1 + ---  0   18.2   18-9   18 Grossberg Network  For example, if the input  zero, Eq.  18.2  will produce  p t    is constant and the initial condition   n 0    is   n t     =  e t –– p 1    .   18.3   A graph of this response, for  response exponentially approaches a steady state value of 1.   and   1=  1=  , is given in Figure 18.10.

First, because Eq.  18.1  is linear, if the input  response  is doubled, then the response will also be doubled, but will maintain the  same shape. This is evident in Eq.  18.3 .

To experiment with the shunting network, use the Neural Network Design  Demonstration Shunting Network  nnd15sn .  Two-Layer Competitive Network  We are now ready to present the Grossberg competitive network. This net- work was inspired by the operation of the mammalian visual system, which  we discussed in the opening section of this chapter.  Grossberg was influ- enced by the work of Chistoph von der Malsburg [vond73], which was influ- enced in turn by the Nobel-prize-winning experimental work of David  Hubel and Torsten Wiesel [HuWi62].  A block diagram of the network is  shown in Figure 18.13.  There are three components to the Grossberg network: Layer 1, Layer 2  and the adaptive weights. Layer 1 is a rough model of the operation of the  retina, while Layer 2 represents the visual cortex. These models do not ful- ly explain the complexity of the human visual system, but they do illustrate  a number of its characteristics. The network includes short-term memory   STM  and long-term memory  LTM  mechanisms, and performs adapta- tion, filtering, normalization and contrast enhancement. In the following  subsections we will discuss the operation of each of the components of the  network.  As we analyze the various elements of the Grossberg network, you will no- tice the similarity to the Kohonen competitive network of the previous  chapter.  18-12  Short-Term Memory Long-Term Memory   Two-Layer Competitive Network  Layer 1  Retina   Layer 2   Visual Cortex   Input  STM  LTM   Adaptive Weights   Normalization  Contrast  Enhancement  Figure 18.13  Grossberg Competitive Network  Layer 1 Layer 1 of the Grossberg network receives external inputs and normalizes  the intensity of the input pattern.  Recall from Chapter 14 that the Ko- honen network performs best when the input patterns are normalized. For  the Grossberg network the normalization is accomplished by the first layer  of the network.  A block diagram of this layer is given in Figure 18.14. Note  that it uses the shunting model, with the excitatory and inhibitory inputs  computed from the input vector   p  .  18  Input  Layer 1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  +W1 S1 x S1 +  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   -W1 S1 x S1  -  p S1 x 1  S1  +  -  n1.   cid:0 1 ε  cid:0   +b1  +  +  +  -b1  - n1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a1  cid:0  cid:0   S1  εdn1 dt = - n1 +  +b1 - n1  [+W1] p -  n1 + -b1  [-W1] p  Figure 18.14  Layer 1 of the Grossberg Network  The equation of operation of Layer 1 is   dn1 t    -------------- dt  =  n1 t     –  +  b+ 1 n1 t     –   W+     1  p  –  n1 t       b- 1+   W-   1  p  .   18.5   18-13   18 Grossberg Network  As we mentioned earlier, the parameter  sponse.

The input vector is normalized so that the total activity is less than  while the relative intensities of the individual elements of the input vector  are maintained. Therefore, the outputs of Layer 1,  , code the relative in- put intensities,  , rather than the instantaneous fluctuations in the total  pi . This result is produced by the on-center off-surround con- input activity,  P nection pattern of the inputs and the nonlinear gain control of the shunting  model.  1 ni  ,   b+ 1  Note that Layer 1 of the Grossberg network explains the brightness con- stancy and brightness contrast characteristics of the human visual system,  which we discussed on page 15-8.

In addition, exper- imental evidence has shown that the on-center off-surround connection  pattern is a characteristic feature of the receptive fields of retinal ganglion  cells [Hube88].  The receptive field is an area of the retina in which the pho- toreceptors feed into a given cell. The figure in the left margin illustrates  the on-center off-surround receptive field of a typical retinal ganglion cell.  A “+” indicates an excitatory region, and a “-” indicates an inhibitory re- gion. It is a two-dimensional pattern, as opposed to the one-dimensional  connections of Eq.  18.6  and Eq.  18.7 .   2 2+  To illustrate the performance of Layer 1, consider the case of two neurons,  with   b+ 1  1=  0.1  ,   =    :  0.1    =  –  1 t    n1  +  – 1  1 t    n1  p1  –  1 t   p2 n1  ,  0.1    =  –  1 t    n2  +  – 1  1 t    n2  p2  –  1 t   p1 n2  .  1 t    dn1 -------------- dt  1 t    dn2 -------------- dt   18.15    18.16   The response of this network, for two different input vectors, is shown in  Figure 18.15. For both input vectors, the second element is four times as  large as the first element, although the total intensity of the second input  vector is five times as large as that of the first input vector  50 vs. 10 . From  Figure 18.15 we can see that the response of the network maintains the rel- ative intensities of the inputs, while limiting the total response. The total  response      will always be less than 1.  +  1 t    n1  1 t    n2  1  0.75  0.5  0.25  1 n2  1 n1  1  0.75  0.5  0.25  1 n2  1 n1  p1  =  2 8  p2  =  10 40  0 0  0.05  0.15  0.2  0 0  0.05  0.15  0.2  0.1 t  0.1 t  Figure 18.15  Layer 1 Response  To experiment with Layer 1 of the Grossberg network, use the Neural Net- work Design Demonstration Grossberg Layer 1  nnd15gl1 .  18-16   Short-Term Memory  Two-Layer Competitive Network  Layer 2 Layer 2 of the Grossberg network, which is a layer of continuous-time in- stars, performs several functions. First, like Layer 1, it normalizes total ac- tivity in the layer. Second, it contrast enhances its pattern, so that the  neuron that receives the largest input will dominate the response.  This is  closely related to the winner-take-all competition in the Hamming network  and the Kohonen network.  Finally, it operates as a short-term memory   STM  by storing the contrast-enhanced pattern.  Figure 18.16 is a diagram of Layer 2. As with Layer 1, the shunting model  forms the basis for Layer 2. The main difference between Layer 2 and Lay- er 1 is that Layer 2 uses feedback connections. The feedback enables the  network to store a pattern, even after the input has been removed. The  feedback also performs the competition that causes the contrast enhance- ment of the pattern. We will demonstrate these properties in the following  discussion.

W2  Note the relationship between these equations and the Hamming and Ko- honen networks. The inputs to Layer 2 are the inner products between the  prototype patterns  rows of the weight matrix    and the output of Layer  1  normalized input pattern . The largest inner product will correspond to  the prototype pattern closest to the input pattern. Layer 2 then performs a  competition between the neurons, which tends to contrast enhance the out- put pattern — maintaining large outputs while attenuating small outputs.  This contrast enhancement is generally milder than the winner-take-all  competition of the Hamming and Kohonen networks. In the Hamming and  Kohonen networks, the competition drives all but one of the neuron out- puts to zero. The exception is the one with the largest input. In the Gross- berg network, the competition maintains large values and attenuates small  values, but does not necessarily drive all small values to zero. The amount   18-18  Contrast Enhance   Two-Layer Competitive Network  of contrast enhancement is determined by the transfer function  will see in the next section.  f2  , as we   Figure 18.17 illustrates the response of Layer 2 when the input vector  a1 0.2 0.8 is applied for     the steady state result obtained from our Layer 1 example   0.25   seconds and then removed.  =  T  w2  Ta1  2  2 t    n2  1  0.75  0.5  0.25  0 0  w2  Ta1  1  2 t    n1  t  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  Figure 18.17  Layer 2 Response  There are two important characteristics of this response.

In Figure 18.17 we can see that after the input is removed  at    seconds  the output of the first neuron decays to zero, while the output of  the second neuron reaches a steady state value of  maintained, even after the input is removed.

There are other connection patterns  that could be used for different applications. Recall, for instance, the emer- gent segmentation problem discussed earlier in this chapter. A structure  that has been proposed to implement this mechanism is the oriented recep- tive field [GrMi89], which is shown in the left margin. For this structure,  the “on”  excitatory  connections come from one side of the field  indicated  by the blue region , and the “off”  inhibitory  connections come from the  other side of the field  indicated by the white region .   The operation of the oriented receptive field is illustrated in Figure 18.18.  When the field is aligned with an edge, the corresponding neuron is acti- vated  large response . When the field is not aligned with an edge, then the  neuron is inactive  small response . This explains why we might perceive  an edge where none exists, as can be seen in the right-most receptive field  shown in Figure 18.18.  For a complete discussion of oriented receptive fields and how they can be  incorporated into a neural network architecture for preattentive vision, see  [GrMi89]. This paper also discusses a mechanism for featural filling-in.

For example, suppose that an input has been  applied for some length of time, so that the output has stabilized to the pat- tern shown in the left margin.  Each point represents the output of an in- dividual neuron.  If the input is then removed, Figure 18.19 demonstrates  how the choice of   will affect the steady state response of the network.

Unfortu- nately, the noise in the pattern will be amplified and stored as easily as the  significant inputs.  See Problem P18.6.  If the transfer function is slower- than-linear  e.g.,   , the steady state response is independent  of the initial conditions; all neurons that begin with nonzero values will  come to the same level in the steady state. All contrast is eliminated, and  noise is amplified.   e n––  f2 n     =  1  Faster-than-linear transfer functions  e.g.,    produce a winner- take-all competition.

When a sigmoid transfer function is used in Layer 2, the pattern is contrast  enhanced; larger values are amplified, and smaller values are attenuated.  All initial neuron outputs that are less than a certain level  called the  quenching threshold by Grossberg [Gros76]  decay to zero. This merges the  noise suppression of the faster-than-linear transfer functions with the per- fect storage produced by linear transfer functions.

W2  Learning Law The third component of the Grossberg network is the learning law for the  adaptive weights  . Grossberg calls these adaptive weights the long-term  memory  LTM . This is because the rows of   will represent patterns that  have been stored and that the network will be able to recognize. As in the  Kohonen and Hamming networks, the stored pattern that is closest to an  input pattern will produce the largest output in Layer 2. In the next sub- section we will look more closely at the relationship between the Grossberg  network and the Kohonen network.

Together,  these terms implement the Hebb rule with decay, which was discussed in  Chapter 13.   Recall from Chapter 13 that it is often useful to turn off learning  and for- getting  when   is not active. This can be accomplished by the following  learning law:  2 t    ni  =  ni  2 t       –  2 wi j  t     +  1 t    nj    ,   18.25   or, in vector form,  =  ni  2 t       –    w2 i  t       +  n1 t       ,   18.26   w2 where  i Eq.  4.4  .  t      is a vector composed of the elements of the ith row of   W2    see   , which allows learning  and forgetting  to occur only when   The terms on the right-hand side of Eq.  18.25  are multiplied  gated  by  2 t     is not  ni zero.

Relation to Kohonen Law  In the previous section we indicated that the Grossberg learning law was a  continuous-time version of the instar learning law, which we discussed in  Chapter 13. Now we want to demonstrate this fact. We will also show that  the Grossberg network is, in its simplest form, a continuous-time version  of the Kohonen competitive network of Chapter 14.  To begin, let’s repeat the Grossberg learning law of Eq.  18.25 :  i  d w2   t    --------------------- dt  =  ni  2 t       –    w2 i  t       +  n1 t       .   18.33   If we approximate the derivative by   i  d w2   t    --------------------- dt  w2 t    i --------------------------------------------    w2 t t+  – t  i  ,     18.34   then we can rewrite Eq.  18.33  as  w2 i  t t+      =  w2 i  t     t  +    2 t     ni    –  w2  i  t     +  n1 t       .   18.35    Compare this equation with the instar rule that was presented in Chapter  13 in Eq.  15.33 .  If we rearrange terms, this can be reduced to  w2 i  t t+     =  1  t –    2 t     ni   w2 i  t     t  +    2 t    n1 t         .  ni   18.36   To simplify the analysis further, assume that a faster-than-linear transfer  function is used in Layer 2, so that only one neuron in that layer will have   18-24   Relation to Kohonen Law  a nonzero output; call it neuron  will be updated:  i  . Then only row   i   of the weight matrix   w2  t t+     =  1 '–   w2 i  t     +  ' n1 t     ,  i   18.37   where   '  =   t    2 t     ni  .  This is almost identical to the Kohonen rule for the competitive network  that we introduced in Chapter 14 in Eq.  16.13 . The weight vector for the  winning neuron  with nonzero output  will be moved toward  , which is a  normalized version of the current input pattern.  n1  There are three major differences between the Grossberg network that we  have presented in this chapter and the basic Kohonen competitive network.  First, the Grossberg network is a continuous-time network  satisfies a set  of nonlinear differential equations . Second, Layer 1 of the Grossberg net- work automatically normalizes the input vectors. Third, Layer 2 of the  Grossberg network can perform a “soft” competition, rather than the win- ner-take-all competition of the Kohonen network. This soft competition al- lows more than one neuron in Layer 2 to learn. This causes the Grossberg  network to operate as a feature map.  18  18-25   18 Grossberg Network  Summary of Results  Basic Nonlinear Model  Leaky Integrator  dn t    ------------ dt  =  –  n t     +  p t     p  +  -  Leaky Integrator  n  . n   cid:0 1 ε  cid:0  ε dn dt = - n + p  Shunting Model  dn t    ------------ dt  =  –  n t     +  b+    –  n t     p+  –    n t     b-+  p-  Input  Basic Shunting Model  p+  p-  +  -  +  -   cid:0  cid:0 1 ε . n  cid:0  cid:0   b+  +  -  n  +  +  b-  ε dn dt = -n +  b+ - n  p+ -  n + b-  p-  b+  0  -b-  n t   18-26   Summary of Results  Two-Layer Competitive Network  Layer 1  Retina   Layer 2   Visual Cortex   Input  STM  LTM   Adaptive Weights   Normalization  Contrast  Enhancement  Layer 1  Input  Layer 1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  +W1 S1 x S1 +  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   -W1 S1 x S1  -  p S1 x 1  S1  +  -  n1.   cid:0 1 ε  cid:0   +b1  +  +  +  -b1  - n1   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  a1  cid:0  cid:0   S1  εdn1 dt = - n1 +  +b1 - n1  [+W1] p -  n1 + -b1  [-W1] p  dn1 t    -------------- dt  =  n1 t     –  +  b+ 1 n1 t     –   W+     1  p  –  n1 t       b- 1+   W-   1  p  1  W+  =  1  W-  =  1 0  0 0 1  0   0 0  1  0 1  1 1 0  1   1 1  0  On-Center  Off-Surround     18-27  18   Layer 2  18 Grossberg Network  Steady State Neuron Activity  1 ni  =  b+ 1P  pi -------------  1 P+     , where   pi   and   P  pi ----= P  S1 =  j  1=  pj  Layer 2  ++  On-Center   cid:0  cid:0   W2 S2 x S1   cid:0  cid:0  +W2 + S2 x S2  +b2  a1  S1   cid:0  cid:0 1 ε n2.  cid:0  cid:0   +  -  +  -  - n2  +  f 2   cid:0  cid:0  a2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   -b2  S2 +  cid:0  cid:0  -W2  cid:0  cid:0  S2 x S2  Off-Surround  εdn2 dt = - n2 +  +b2 - n2  {[+W2] f 2 n2  + W2 a1}  -  n2 + -b2  [-W2] f 2 n2   dn2 t    -------------- dt  =  n2 t     –  +  b+ 2 n2 t     –   W+ 2       f2 n2 t          W2a1 +    n2 t       b- 2+   W-   2  f2 n2 t          –  18-28   Summary of Results  Choice of Transfer Function  f 2 n   Linear  Stored Pattern  n2 ∞   Comments  Perfect storage of any pattern, but amplifies noise.

This form of the differential equation describing the evolution of the rela- tive outputs is very useful in demonstrating the characteristics of Layer 2,  as we will see in the next solved problem.

To motivate the network, we presented a  brief description of the primary visual pathway. We also discussed some vi- sual illusions, which help us to understand the mechanisms underlying the  visual system.  The Grossberg network is a two-layer, continuous-time competitive net- work, which is very similar in structure and operation to the Kohonen com- petitive network presented in Chapter 14. The first layer of the Grossberg  network normalizes the input pattern. It demonstrates how the visual sys- tem can use on-center off-surround connection patterns and a shunting  model to implement an automatic gain control, which normalizes total ac- tivity.   The second layer of the Grossberg network performs a competition, which  contrast enhances the output pattern and stores it in short-term memory.  It uses nonlinear feedback and the on-center off-surround connection pat- tern to produce the competition and the storage. The choice of the transfer  function and the feedback connection pattern determines the degree of  competition  e.g., winner-take-all, mild contrast enhancement, or no  change in the pattern .  The adaptive weights in the Grossberg network use an instar learning rule,  which stores prototype patterns in long-term memory. When a winner- take-all competition is performed in the second layer, this learning rule is  equivalent to the Kohonen learning rule used in Chapter 14.   As with the Kohonen network, one key problem of the Grossberg network  is the stability of learning; as more inputs are applied to the network, the  weight matrix may never converge. This problem was discussed extensive- ly in Chapter 14. In Chapter 16 we will present a class of networks that is  designed to overcome this difficulty: the Adaptive Resonance Theory  ART   networks. The ART networks are direct descendents of the Grossberg net- work presented in this chapter.  Another problem with the Grossberg network, which we have not discussed  in this chapter, is the stability of the differential equations that implement  the network. In Layer 2, for example, we have a set of differential equations  with nonlinear feedback. Can we make some general statement about the  stability of such systems? Chapter 17 will present a comprehensive discus- sion of this problem.  18-42   Further Reading  Further Reading  [GrMi89]  [Gros76]  S. Grossberg, E. Mingolla and D.

There is no guarantee that, as  more inputs are applied to the network, the weight matrix will eventually  converge. In this chapter we will present a modified type of competitive  learning, called adaptive resonance theory  ART , which is designed to  overcome the problem of learning stability.  19-1   19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  Theory and Examples  Stability Plasticity  A key problem of the Grossberg network presented in Chapter 18 and the  competitive networks of Chapter 16, is that they do not always form stable  clusters  or categories . Grossberg did show [Gros76] that if the number of  input patterns is not too large, or if the input patterns do not form too many  clusters relative to the number of neurons in Layer 2, then the learning  eventually stabilizes. However, he also showed that the standard competi- tive networks do not have stable learning in response to arbitrary input  patterns. The learning instability occurs because of the network’s adapt- ability  or plasticity , which causes prior learning to be eroded by more re- cent learning.  Grossberg refers to this problem as the “stability plasticity dilemma.” How  can a system be receptive to significant new patterns and yet remain stable  in response to irrelevant patterns? We know that biological systems are  very good at this. For example, you can easily recognize your mother’s face,  even if you have not seen her for a long time and have met many new people  in the mean time.  Grossberg and Gail Carpenter developed a theory, called adaptive reso- nance theory  ART , to address the stability plasticity dilemma  see  [CaGr87a], [CaGr87b], [CaGr90], [CaGrRe91] and [CaGrMa92] . The ART  networks are based on the Grossberg network of Chapter 18. The key inno- vation of ART is the use of “expectations.” As each input pattern is present- ed to the network, it is compared with the prototype vector that it most  closely matches  the expectation . If the match between the prototype and  the input vector is not adequate, a new prototype is selected. In this way,  previously learned memories  prototypes  are not eroded by new learning.  It is beyond the scope of this text to discuss all of the variations of adaptive  resonance theory. Instead, we will present one of the ART networks in de- tail — ART1  see [CaGr87a] . This particular network is designed for bina- ry input vectors only. However, from this one architecture, the key features  of adaptive resonance theory can be understood.  Overview of Adaptive Resonance  The basic ART architecture is shown in Figure 19.1. It is a modification of  the Grossberg network of Chapter 18  compare with Figure 18.13 , which  is designed to stabilize the learning process. The innovations of the ART ar- chitecture consist of three parts: Layer 2  L2  to Layer 1  L1  expectations,  the orienting subsystem and gain control. In this section we will describe  the general operation of the ART system; then, in later sections, we will dis- cuss each subsystem in detail.  19-2   Overview of Adaptive Resonance  Layer 1  Layer 2  Input  Gain Control  Expectation  Reset  Orienting Subsystem  Figure 19.1  Basic ART Architecture  Recall from Chapter 18 that the L1-L2 connections of the Grossberg net- work are instars, which perform a clustering  or categorization  operation.  When an input pattern is presented to the network, it is multiplied  after  normalization  by the L1-L2 weight matrix. Then, a competition is per- formed at Layer 2 to determine which row of the weight matrix is closest to  the input vector. That row is then moved toward the input vector. After  learning is complete, each row of the L1-L2 weight matrix is a prototype  pattern, which represents a cluster  or category  of input vectors.  In the ART networks, learning also occurs in a set of feedback connections  from Layer 2 to Layer 1. These connections are outstars  see Chapter 15 ,  which perform pattern recall. When a node in Layer 2 is activated, this re- produces a prototype pattern  the expectation  at Layer 1. Layer 1 then  performs a comparison between the expectation and the input pattern.  When the expectation and the input pattern are not closely matched, the  orienting subsystem causes a reset in Layer 2. This reset disables the cur- rent winning neuron, and the current expectation is removed. A new com- petition is then performed in Layer 2, while the previous winning neuron  is disabled. The new winning neuron in Layer 2 projects a new expectation  to Layer 1, through the L2-L1 connections. This process continues until the  L2-L1 expectation provides a close enough match to the input pattern.  In the following sections we will investigate each of the subsystems of the  ART system, as they apply to one particular ART network — ART1   [CaGr87a] . We will first describe the differential equations that describe  the subsystem operations. Then we will derive the steady state responses  of each subsystem. Finally, we will summarize the overall operation of the  ART1 system.  19-3  19   19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  Layer 1  The main purpose of Layer 1 is to compare the input pattern with the ex- pectation pattern from Layer 2.  Both patterns are binary in ART1.  If the  patterns are not closely matched, the orienting subsystem will cause a re- set in Layer 2. If the patterns are close enough, Layer 1 combines the ex- pectation and the input to form a new prototype pattern.  Layer 1 of the ART1 network, which is displayed in Figure 19.2, is very  similar to Layer 1 of the Grossberg network  see Figure 18.14 . The differ- ences occur at the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the shunting model.  For the ART1 network, no normalization is performed at Layer 1; therefore  we don’t have the on-center off-surround connections from the input vector.  The excitatory input to Layer 1 of ART1 consists of a combination of the in- put pattern and the L1-L2 expectation. The inhibitory input consists of the  gain control signal from Layer 2. In the following we will explain how these  inputs work together.

For example, as- sume that the jth neuron in Layer 2 has won the competition, so that its  output is 1, and the other neurons have zero output. For this case we have  , which is   p W2:1a2 t   +  W2:1a2  =  2:1 w2 w1  2:1  wj  2:1  w  2:1 S2  =  2:1  wj  ,   19.4   0 0  1   2:1  wj   is the jth column of the matrix   where  trained using an outstar rule, as we will show in a later section.  Now we  can see that   matrix is   .  The   W2:1  W2:1  p W2:1a2  +  =  p wj  +  2:1  .   19.5   Therefore the excitatory input to Layer 1 is the sum of the input pattern  and the L2-L1 expectation. Each column of the L2-L1 matrix represents a  different expectation  prototype pattern . Layer 1 combines the input pat- tern with the expectation using an AND operation, as we will see later.  The inhibitory input to Layer 1 is the gain control term   1  W-    a2 t   , where  1  W-  =  1 1  1 1 1  1 .   1 1  1  19   19.6   Therefore, the inhibitory input to each neuron in Layer 1 is the sum of all  of the outputs of Layer 2. Since we will be using a winner-take-all compe- tition in Layer 2, whenever Layer 2 is active there will be one, and only one,  nonzero element of   after the competition. Therefore the gain control in- put to Layer 1 will be one when Layer 2 is active, and zero when Layer 2 is  inactive  all neurons having zero output . The purpose of this gain control  will become apparent as we analyze the steady state behavior of Layer 1.  a2  19-5   19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  Steady State Analysis The response of neuron   i   in Layer 1 is described by  1 dni -------- dt    =  1– ni  b+ 1    +  1– ni  2  2:1aj wi j  –    1 ni  b- 1+    2 aj  ,   19.7      pi     S2 +  j  1=        S2   j  1=    1«   so that the short-term memory traces  the neuron outputs    where  change much faster than the long-term memory traces  the weight matri- ces .  We want to investigate the steady state response of this system for two dif- ferent cases. In the first case Layer 2 is inactive, therefore   for all  .  j In the second case Layer 2 is active, and therefore one neuron has an out- put of 1, and all other neurons output 0.   0=  2 aj  Consider first the case where Layer 2 is inactive.

Since   function, then   a1  p=  .   19.11   Therefore, when Layer 2 is inactive, the output of Layer 1 is the same as  the input pattern.  Now let’s consider the second case, where Layer 2 is active. Assume that  neuron   for  k   is the winning neuron in Layer 2. Then   . For this case Eq.  19.7  simplifies to   and   1=  0=  2 aj  2 ak  j  j  19-6   Layer 1  1 dni -------- dt    =  1– ni  +    b+ 1 ni 1–  2:1  pi wi j +    –    1 ni  b- 1+    .   19.12    19.13    19.14    19.15    19.16    19.17   In the steady state    1 t    dt    dni  0=    we have  0  = =  1– ni  1 –  + +  b+ 1 ni 1–  2:1 + pi wi j  2:1  pi wi j + 1  ni + + 1  b- 1+  b+ 1 pi wi j 2:1  1  – ni +     b- 1–   .

Recall that Layer 1 should combine the input vector with the expectation  from Layer 2  represented by   . Since we are dealing with binary pat- terns  both the input and the expectation , we will use a logical AND oper- 1  to be less than  ation to combine the two vectors. In other words, we want  ni 1  is equal to zero, and we want  zero when either   to be greater  ni than zero when both    are equal to one.   2:1 wi j  and   wj  pi  2:1   or  pi  2:1 wi j  If we apply these conditions to Eq.  19.14 , we obtain the following equa- tions:  which we can combine to produce  b+ 1 2   b- 1–  0  ,  b+ 1  b- 1–  0  ,  b+ 1 2     b- 1  b+ 1  .   b- 1  For example, we can use   b+ 1  1=   and   =  1.5   to satisfy these conditions.  Therefore, if Eq.  19.17  is satisfied, and neuron   of Layer 2 is active, then  the output of Layer 1 will be  j  a1  =  p wj  2:1  ,   19.18   where  represents the logical AND operation.  Notice that we needed the gain control in order to implement the AND op- eration. Consider the numerator of Eq.  19.14 :  b+ 1 pi wi j  +  2:1    b- 1–  .   19.19   19-7  19   2 2+  To demonstrate the operation of Layer 1, assume the following network pa- rameters:  19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  b- 1  The term   is multiplied by the gain control term, which in this case is 1.  If this term did not exist, then Eq.  19.19  would be greater than zero  and  therefore   was  greater than zero. This would represent an OR operation, rather than an  AND operation. As we will see when we discuss the orienting subsystem, it  is critical that Layer 1 perform an AND operation.   would be greater than zero  whenever either   2:1 wi j   or   1 ni  pi  When Layer 2 is inactive, the gain control term is zero. This is necessary  because in that case we want Layer 1 to respond to the input pattern alone,  since no expectation will be activated by Layer 2.  To summarize the steady state operation of Layer 1:  If Layer 2 is not active  i.e., each   2 aj  0=   ,  If Layer 2 is active  i.e., one   2 aj  1=   ,  a1  p=  .  a1  =  p wj  2:1  .   19.20    19.21     =  0.1  ,   b+ 1  1=   and   b- 1  =  1.5  .   19.22   Assume also that we have two neurons in Layer 2, two elements in the in- put vector and the following weight matrix and input:  W2:1  =   and   p  =  1 1 0 1  .  0 1   19.23   If we take the case where Layer 2 is active, and neuron 2 of Layer 2 wins  the competition, the equations of operation of Layer 1 are  0.1    1 dn1 -------- dt  0.1    1 dn2 -------- dt  =  =  =  =  1– n1  +  1– 1 n1  2:1  p1 w1 2   +    –    1 n1  1.5+     19.24   1– n1  +  1– 1 n1   0 1+    –    1 n1  1.5+    =  –  1 3n1  –  0.5  1– n2  +  1– 1 n2  2:1  p2 w2 2   +    –    1 n2  1.5+     19.25   1– n2  +  1– 1 n2   1 1+    –    1 n2  1.5+    =  –  1 4n2  +  0.5 .  These can be simplified to obtain  19-8   In this simple case we can find closed-form solutions for these equations.

Its main purpose is to contrast enhance its output  pattern. For our implementation of the ART1 network, the contrast en- hancement will be a winner-take-all competition, so only the neuron that  receives the largest input will have a nonzero output.  There is one major difference between the second layers of the Grossberg  and the ART1 networks. Layer 2 of the ART1 network uses an integrator  that can be reset. In this type of integrator, whose symbol is shown in the  left margin, any positive outputs are reset to zero whenever the   signal  becomes positive. The outputs that are reset remain inhibited for a long pe- riod of time, so that they cannot be driven above zero.  By a “long” period  of time we mean until an adequate match has occurred and the weights  have been updated.   a0  In the original ART1 paper, Carpenter and Grossberg suggested that the  reset mechanism could be implemented using a gated dipole field  [CaGr87]. They later suggested a more sophisticated biological model, us- ing chemical neurotransmitters, in their ART3 architecture [CaGr90]. For  our purposes we will not be concerned with the specific biological imple- mentation.  Figure 19.4 displays the complete Layer 2 of the ART1 network. Again, it  is almost identical to Layer 2 of the Grossberg network  see Figure 18.16 ,  with the primary exception of the resetable integrator. The reset signal,  ,  is the output of the orienting subsystem, which we will discuss in the next  section. It generates a reset whenever there is a mismatch at Layer 1 be- tween the input signal and the L2-L1 expectation.  a0  One other small difference between Layer 2 of the ART1 network and Lay- er 2 of the Grossberg network is that two transfer functions are used in  ART1. The transfer function  feedback connections, while the output of Layer 2 is computed as  a2 want the output of Layer 2 to be a binary signal.  . The reason for the second transfer function is that we    is used for the on-center off-surround   hardlim+ n2  f2 n2  =      19-10   Layer 2  Layer 2  +  On-Center   cid:0  cid:0  +  cid:0  cid:0   W1:2 S2 x S1  +  -  +  -  n2.   cid:0 1 ε  cid:0    cid:0  cid:0  +W2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0  S2 x S2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   f 2  +b2  -b2  +  -  n2  +  +   cid:0  cid:0  a2  cid:0  cid:0   cid:0  cid:0   S2   cid:0  cid:0 S2 x S2 -W2 ε dn2 dt = - n2 +  +b2 - n2  {[+W2] f 2 n2  + W1:2 a1}  Off-Surround  -  n2 + -b2  [-W2] f 2 n2   Figure 19.4  Layer 2 of the ART1 Network  The equation of operation of Layer 2 is   a1  a0 Reset  dn2 t    -------------- dt  =  n2 t     –  +  b+ 2 n2 t     –   W+ 2       f2 n2 t          W1:2a1 +     19.31   n2 t       b- 2+   W-   2  f2 n2 t          .  –  2  2  W+      W+   provides on-center feedback connections  identical to Layers 1   This is a shunting model with excitatory input  where   con- and 2 of the Grossberg network of Chapter 18, Eq.  18.6  , and  sists of adaptive weights, analogous to the weights in the Kohonen net- work.

The rows of  this weight matrix are normalized, as will be explained in a later section.   The largest inner product will correspond to the prototype pattern that is  closest to the output of Layer 1. Layer 2 then performs a competition be- tween the neurons. The transfer function   is chosen to be a faster-than- linear transfer function  see Chapter 18, page 18-20, for a discussion of the   . This choice will force the neuron with largest input to have  effect of  a positive  , and the other neuron to have a negative    with appropriate  choice of network parameters .

Its purpose is to determine if there is a sufficient match between  the L2-L1 expectation and the input pattern. When there is not enough of  a match, the Orienting Subsystem should send a reset signal to Layer 2.  The reset signal will cause a long-lasting inhibition of the previous winning  neuron, and thus allow another neuron to win the competition.

Learning Law: L1-L2  The ART1 network has two separate learning laws: one for the L1-L2 con- nections, and another for the L2-L1 connections. The L1-L2 connections  use a type of instar learning to learn to recognize a set of prototype pat- terns. The L2-L1 connections use outstar learning in order to reproduce  or  recall  a set of prototype patterns. In this section we will describe the L1-  19-16   Resonance  Learning Law: L1-L2  L2 instar learning law, and in the following section we will present the L2- L1 outstar learning law.  We should note that the L1-L2 connections and the L2-L1 connections are  updated at the same time. Whenever the input pattern and the expectation  have an adequate match, as determined by the Orienting Subsystem, both  W1:2  are adapted. This process of matching, and subsequent ad- aptation, is referred to as resonance, hence the name adaptive resonance  theory.   and   W2:1  Subset Superset Dilemma The learning in the L1-L2 connections of the ART1 network is very close to  the learning in the Grossberg network of Chapter 18, with one major dif- ference. In the Grossberg network, the input patterns are normalized in  Layer 1, and therefore all of the prototype patterns will have the same  length. In the ART1 network no normalization takes place in Layer 1.  Therefore a problem can occur when one prototype pattern is a subset of  another. For example, suppose that the L1-L2 connection matrix is  W1:2  =  1 1 0 1 1 1  ,   19.50   so that the prototype patterns are  w1:2 1  =   and   w1:2 2  =   19.51   1 1 0  .  1 1 1  w1:2 1   is a subset of   w1:2 2  , since   w1:2  2   has a 1 wherever   w1:2 1   has   We say that  a 1.  If the output of Layer 1 is  a1  =  ,  1 1 0  then the input to Layer 2 will be  W1:2a1  =  1 1 0 1 1 1  =  .  2 2  1 1 0  19-17  19   19.52    19.53    19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  Both prototype vectors have the same inner product with  the first prototype is identical to  called the subset superset dilemma.  , even though   and the second prototype is not. This is   a1  a1  One solution to the subset superset dilemma is to normalize the prototype  patterns. That is, when a prototype pattern has a large number of nonzero  entries, the magnitude of each entry should be reduced. For example, using  our preceding problem, we could modify the L1-L2 matrix as follows:  The input to Layer 2 will then be  W1:2  =  1 --- 2 1 --- 3  1 --- 0 2 1 --- 3  1 --- 3  .  W1:2a1  =  1 --- 2 1 --- 3  1 --- 0 2 1 --- 3  1 --- 3  1 1 0  =  .  1 2 --- 3   19.54    19.55   Now we have the desired result: the first prototype has the largest inner  product with   . The first neuron in Layer 2 will be activated.  a1  In the Grossberg network of Chapter 18 we obtained normalized prototype  patterns by normalizing the input patterns in Layer 1. In the ART1 net- work we will normalize the prototype patterns by using an on-center off- surround competition in the L1-L2 learning law.

When neuron  tive, the ith row of  ence between Eq.  19.56  and the standard instar learning is that the  elements of   is normalized. In the bracket  on the right side of Eq.  19.56  we can see that it has the form of a shunting  a1 . The excita- model, with on-center off-surround input connections from  b-   a vector of 1’s , and the inhibitory bias is  , which  tory bias is  0= ensures that the elements of   remain between 0 and 1.

For this analysis we will as- sume that the outputs of Layer 1 and Layer 2 remain constant until the  weights reach steady state. This is called fast learning.

Therefore the prototype patterns will be normalized, and this will solve the  subset superset dilemma.  By “normalized” here we do not mean that all  prototype vectors will have unit length in Euclidean distance, but simply  that the rows of   that have more nonzero entries will have elements  with smaller magnitudes. In this case, vectors with more nonzero entries  may actually have a smaller length than vectors with fewer nonzero en- tries.   W1:2  W2:1  The L2-L1 connections,  , in the ART1 architecture are trained using  an outstar learning rule. The purpose of the L2-L1 connections is to recall  an appropriate prototype pattern  the expectation , so that it can be com- pared and combined, in Layer 1, with the input pattern. When the expec- tation and the input pattern do not match, a reset is sent to Layer 2, so that  a new prototype pattern can be chosen  as we have discussed in previous  sections .  The learning law for   W2:1   is a typical outstar equation:  2:1 t    d wj ------------------------- dt  =  2 t  wj aj  –    2:1 t   a1 t     .  +   19.65   Therefore, if neuron  column  investigate the steady state operation of Eq.  19.65 .   in Layer 2 is active  has won the competition , then   pattern.

The input patterns continue to be applied to the network until the weights  stabilize  do not change . Carpenter and Grossberg have shown [CaGr87a]  that the ART1 algorithm will always form stable clusters for any set of in- put patterns.  See Problems P19.5, P19.6 and P19.7 for detailed examples of the ART1 al- gorithm.  19-22   19.70    19.71    19.72    19.73    Other ART Architectures  To experiment with the ART1 algorithm, use the Neural Network Design  Demonstration ART1  nnd16a1 .  Other ART Architectures  The ART1 network is just one example of adaptive resonance theory. Car- penter and Grossberg, and others in their research group, have developed  many variations on this theme.  One disadvantage of the ART1 network is that it can only be used for bina- ry input patterns. Carpenter and Grossberg developed a variation of ART1,  called ART2, to handle either analog or binary patterns [CaGr87b]. The ba- sic structure of ART2 is very similar to ART1, with the exception of Layer  1. In ART2 several sublayers take the place of Layer 1. These sublayers are  needed because analog vectors, unlike binary vectors, can be arbitrarily  close together. The sublayers perform a combination of normalization and  noise suppression, in addition to the comparison of the input vector and the  expectation that is needed by the orienting subsystem.  Carpenter and Grossberg later developed the ART3 network [CaGr90],  which introduced a more sophisticated biological model for the reset mech- anism required for ART. Up to the present time, this network has not been  widely applied.  In 1991 Carpenter, Grossberg and Reynolds introduced the ARTMAP net- work [CaGrRe91]. In contrast with all of the previous ART networks, it is  a supervised network. The ARTMAP architecture consists of two ART mod- ules that are connected by an “inter-ART” associative memory. One ART  module receives the input vector, while the other ART module receives the  desired output vector. The network learns to predict the correct output vec- tor whenever the input vector is presented.  More recently, Carpenter, Grossberg, Markuzon, Reynolds and Rosen have  modified the ARTMAP architecture to incorporate fuzzy logic. The result is  referred to as Fuzzy ARTMAP [CaGrMa92].

This completes the training, since if you apply any of the three patterns  again they will not change the weights.  Verify this for yourself by applying   19-41   19 Adaptive Resonance Theory  each input pattern to the network.  These patterns have been successfully  clustered.   Note that in Problem P19.5, where the vigilance was  , the patterns  were clustered into two categories. In this problem, with vigilance  ,  the patterns were clustered into three categories. The closer the vigilance  is to 1, the more categories will be used. This is because an input pattern  must be closer to a prototype in order to be incorporated into that proto- type. When the vigilance is close to zero, many different input patterns can  be incorporated into one prototype. The vigilance parameter adjusts the  coarseness of the categorization.  0.4  0.6      =  =  P19.7 Train an ART1 network using the following input vectors  see   [CaGr87a] :  p1  p2  p3  p4  Present the vectors in the order    i.e.,  p1 p2 p3 p1 p4 sented twice in each epoch .

If a  learning algorithm is sensitive to new inputs  plastic , then it runs the risk  of forgetting prior learning  unstable . The ART networks were designed to  achieve learning stability while maintaining sensitivity to novel inputs.   In this chapter, the ART1 network was used to illustrate the key concepts  of adaptive resonance theory. The ART1 network is based on the Grossberg  competitive network of Chapter 18, with a few modifications. The key inno- vation of ART is the use of “expectations.” As each input pattern is present- ed to the network, it is compared with the prototype vector that it most  closely matches  the expectation . If the match between the prototype and  the input vector is not adequate, a new prototype is selected. In this way,  previously learned memories  prototypes  are not eroded by new learning.  One important point to keep in mind when analyzing ART networks, is  that they were designed to be biologically plausible mechanisms for learn- ing. They have as much to do with understanding how the brain works as  they do with inspiring practical pattern recognition systems. For this rea- son, the learning mechanisms are required to use only local information at  each neuron. This is not true of all of the learning rules discussed in this  text.  Although the ART networks solve the problem of learning instability, in  which the network weights never stabilize, there is another stability prob- lem that we have not yet discussed. This is the stability of the differential  equations that implement the short-term memory equations of the net- work. In Layer 2, for example, we have a set of differential equations with  nonlinear feedback. Can we make some general statement about the sta- bility of such systems? Chapter 20 will present a comprehensive discussion  of this problem.  19-44   Further Reading  Further Reading  [CaGr87a]  G. A. Carpenter and S.

It was noted there that  the output of a recurrent network could converge to a stable point, oscillate,  or perhaps even diverge. The “stability” of the steepest descent process and  of the LMS algorithm were discussed in Chapter 9 and Chapter 10, respec- tively. The stability of Grossberg’s continuous-time recurrent networks  was discussed in Chapter 18.   In this chapter we will define stability more carefully. Our objective is to  determine whether a particular set of nonlinear equations has points  or  trajectories  to which its output might converge. To help us study this topic  we will introduce Lyapunov’s Stability Theorem and apply it to a simple,  but instructive, problem. Then, we will present a generalization of the  Lyapunov Theory: LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem. This will set the stage for  Chapter 21, where LaSalle’s theorem is used to prove the stability of  Hopfield networks.  20  20-1   20 Stability  Theory and Examples  Recurrent Networks  We first discussed recurrent neural networks, which have feedback connec- tions from their outputs to their inputs, when we introduced the Hamming  and Hopfield networks in Chapter 3. The Grossberg networks of Chapter  18 and Chapter 19 also contain recurrent connections. Recurrent networks  are potentially more powerful than feedforward networks, since they are  able to recognize and recall temporal, as well as spatial, patterns. However,  the behavior of these recurrent networks is much more complex than that  of feedforward networks.   For feedforward networks, the output is constant  for a fixed input  and is  a function only of the network input. For recurrent networks, however, the  output of the network is a function of time. For a given input and a given  initial network output, the response of the network may converge to a sta- ble output. However, it may also oscillate, explode to infinity, or follow a  chaotic pattern. In the remainder of this chapter we want to investigate  general nonlinear recurrent networks, in order to determine their long- term behavior.   We will consider recurrent networks that can be described by nonlinear dif- ferential equations of the form:  d a t  td  =  g a t ,p t ,t     .   20.1   p t   Here   See Figure 20.1.     is the input to the network, and   a t    is the output of the network.

We will  be most interested in those cases where the network converges to a con- stant output — a stable equilibrium point. A nonlinear system can have  many stable points. For some neural networks these stable points repre- sent stored prototype patterns. When possible, we would like to know  where the stable points are, and which initial conditions   converge to  a given stable point  i.e., what is the basin of attraction for a given stable  point? .   a 0   To begin our discussion, let’s introduce some basic stability concepts with  a simple, intuitive example. Consider the motion of a ball bearing, with dis- sipative friction, in a gravity field. In the adjacent figure, we have a ball  bearing at the bottom of a trough  point   . If we move the bearing to a  different position, it will oscillate back and forth in the trough, but, because  of friction, it will eventually settle back to the bottom of the trough. We will  call this position an asymptotically stable point, which we will define more  precisely in the next section.  a  Consider now the second figure in the left margin. Here we have a ball  bearing positioned at the center of a flat surface. If we place the bearing in  a different position, it will not move. The position at the center of the sur- face is not asymptotically stable, since the bearing does not move back to  the center if it is moved away. However, it is stable in a certain sense, be- cause at least the ball does not roll farther away from the center point. We  call this kind of point stable in the sense of Lyapunov, which we will define  in the next section.  Now consider the third figure in the left margin. The ball bearing is posi- tioned at the top of a hill. This is an equilibrium point, since the ball will  remain at the top of the hill, if we position it carefully. However, if the bear- ing is given the slightest disturbance, it will roll down the hill. This is an  unstable equilibrium point.  In the next chapter we will try to design Hopfield neural networks, in  which the stored prototype patterns will be asymptotically stable equilibri- um points. We would also like the basins of attraction for these stable  points to be as large as possible.  For example, consider Figure 20.2. We would like to design neural net- works with large basins of attraction such as those of Case A. One can cer- tainly imagine that if a ball that rolls with high friction is placed  with zero  velocity  in any one of the basins of Case A, it will remain in that basin and  will eventually find its way to the bottom  stable point . However, Case B  is more complicated. If, for instance, one places a ball with friction at point  P, it is not clear which stable point will eventually capture the ball. The ball  may not come to rest at the stable point closest to P. It is also difficult to  tell how large the basin of attraction is for a specific stable point.  20-3  20   20 Stability  Case A  Large Basin of Attraction  Equilibrium Point  Stability  Definition 1: Stability  in the sense of Lyapunov   Case B  P  Complex Region of Attraction  Figure 20.2  Basins of Attraction  Now that we have presented some intuitive notions of stability, we will pur- sue them with mathematical rigor in the remainder of this chapter.  Definitions We will begin with specific mathematical definitions of the different types  of stability discussed in the previous section. In these definitions we will be  talking about the stability of an equilibrium point; a point   where the de- rivative in Eq.  20.1  is zero. For simplicity, we will talk specifically about  the point  , which is referred to as the origin. This restriction does  not affect the generality of our discussion.  0=  a  a  The origin is a stable equilibrium point if for any given value  exists a number  a t    there  , then the resulting motion    such that if    satisfies   a 0    for       a t   0  0  0        .  t  This definition says that the system output is not going to move too far  away from a given stable point, so long as it is initially close to the stable  point. Let’s say that you want the system output to remain within a dis-  of the origin. If the origin is stable, then you can always find a dis- tance     which may be a function of   , such that if the system output is  tance   within   of   of the origin at time   the origin. The position of the ball  with zero velocity  in the figure to the  left is stable in the sense of Lyapunov, so long as the ball bearing has fric- tion. If the ball bearing did not have friction, then any initial velocity would  produce a trajectory  vector  ball.    in this case would consist of the position and the velocity of the    in which the position would go to infinity.  The   , then it will always remain within   a t   a t   0=      t  Next, let’s consider the stronger concept of asymptotic stability.  20-4   Lyapunov Stability Theorem  Asymptotic Stability  Definition 2: Asymptotic Stability  The origin is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point if there exists a  number  a t    such that whenever  t   the resulting motion satisfies    0  0  as     a 0     .  This is a stronger definition of stability. It says that as long as the output  of the system is initially within some distance   of the stable point, the out- put will eventually converge to the stable point. The position of the ball   with zero velocity  in the diagram in the left margin is asymptotically sta- ble, so long as the ball bearing has friction. If there is no friction, the posi- tion is only stable in the sense of Lyapunov.    We would like to build neural networks that have many specified asymp- totically stable points, each of which represents a prototype pattern. This  is the design objective we will use for building Hopfield networks in Chap- ter 21.  In addition to the stability definitions, there is another concept we will use  in analyzing stability. It is the concept of a definite function. The next two  definitions will clarify this concept.  Positive Definite  Definition 3: Positive Definite  A scalar function  a  0  .  V a    is positive definite if   V 0   0=   and   V a   0   for   Positive Semidefinite  Definition 4: Positive Semidefinite  A scalar function   V a    is positive semidefinite if   V a   0   for all   a  .   These definitions can be modified appropriately to define the concepts neg- ative definite and negative semidefinite.  Now that we have defined stabili- ty, let’s consider a method for testing stability.  Lyapunov Stability Theorem  One of the most important approaches for investigating the stability of  nonlinear systems is the theory introduced by Alexandr Mikhailovich  Lyapunov, a Russian mathematician. Although his major work was first  published in 1892, it received little attention outside Russia until much lat- er. In this section we will discuss one of Lyapunov’s most powerful tech- niques for stability analysis — the so-called direct method.  Consider the autonomous  unforced, no explicit time dependence  system:  20  da td  =  g a   .   20.2   20-5   20 Stability  The Lyapunov stability theorem can then be stated as follows.

It gives us no information  about the stability of the system in those situations where we are unable to  find such a function.  V a   Pendulum Example  We can gain some insight into Lyapunov’s stability theorem by applying it  to a simple mechanical system. This system is very simple, and its opera- tion is easy to visualize, and yet it illustrates important concepts that we  will apply to neural network design in the next chapter. The example sys- tem we will use is the pendulum shown in Figure 20.3.  l  θ  m  mg  Figure 20.3  Pendulum  Using Newton’s second law   tion of the pendulum as  F  =  ma   , we can write the equation of opera-  ml   2  d     t2 d  =  –  c  –  mg  sin      ,  d td   20.3   20-6   Pendulum Example  or  ml   +  c  +  mg  sin      0=  ,   20.4   2 d  t2 d  d td   is the angle of the pendulum,     where  the length of the pendulum,  itational constant.  c   is the damping coefficient, and    is the mass of the pendulum,   is   is the grav-  m  g  l  The first term on the right side of Eq.  20.3  is the damping force, which is  proportional to the velocity of the pendulum. It is this term that represents  the energy dissipation in the system. The second term on the right side of  Eq.  20.3  is the gravitational force, which is proportional to the sine of the  angle of the pendulum. It is equal to zero when the pendulum is straight  down and has its maximum value when the pendulum is horizontal.    0=  , but more generally it is   If the damping coefficient is not zero, the pendulum will eventually come to  rest hanging down in the vertical position.

Let’s choose the following state variables:  We can write equations for the pendulum in terms of these state variables  as follows:  a1  =   and   a2  =  d td  .  da1 td  a2=  ,  da2 td  =  –  sin  a1    –  g --- l  c ------a2 ml  .  da1 td  =  a2  =  0  ,  20-7   20.5    20.6    20.7    20.8   20  Now we want to investigate the stability of the origin     for this pen- dulum system.  The origin corresponds to a pendulum angle of zero and a  pendulum velocity of zero.  We first want to check that the origin is an equi- librium point. We do this by substituting    into the state equations.  0=  0=  a  a   20 Stability  da2 td  =  –  sin  a1    –  g --- l  c ------a2 ml  =  –  sin  0   –  g --- l  c ------ 0  ml  =  0   20.9   Since the derivatives are zero, the origin is an equilibrium point.   Next we need to find a Lyapunov function for the pendulum. For this ex- ample we will use the energy of the system as the Lyapunov function  . To  obtain the total energy of the pendulum, we add the kinetic and potential  energies.

Thus,   0=  a1  a2    In this case we know that as long as the pendulum has friction, it will even- tually settle in a vertical position, and, therefore, that the origin is asymp- totically stable. However, Lyapunov’s theorem, using our Lyapunov  function, can only tell us that the origin is stable. To prove that the origin  is asymptotically stable, we will need a refinement of Lyapunov’s theorem,  LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem. We will discuss LaSalle’s theorem in the  next section.  20-8   Pendulum Example  2 2+  First, let’s investigate the pendulum further, by taking a specific numerical  example. Let  . Now we can rewrite the  state equations for the pendulum as  9.8 m  1.96  9.8  =  =  =  =  1  g  c      l  Expressions for   V   and its derivative follow:  da1 td  a2=  ,  da2 td  sin–=  a1    –  0.2a2  .

Figure 20.4 displays the 3-D and contour plots of the energy surface,  , as  the angle varies between -10 and +10 radians and the angular velocity var- ies between -2 and 2 radians per second. Note that in this range there are  three possible minimum points of the energy surface, at 0 and   2  V  .  400  300  200  100  0 2  a2  2  1  0  -1  -2  1  0  a2  -1  -5  0  a1  -2  -10  10  5  -10  -5  5  10  0 a1  20  Figure 20.4  Pendulum Energy Surface   We will find in Chapter 21 that the minimum points of the Lyapunov func- tion can correspond to prototype patterns in an autoassociative neural net- work. The pendulum system, like recurrent neural networks, has many  minimum points.   Of course, the energy plots shown in Figure 20.4 do not tell us in what way,  or by what route, the pendulum finds a particular energy minimum. To   20-9   20 Stability  show this, we have plotted the energy contours, and one particular path for  the pendulum, in Figure 20.5. The response trajectory, shown by the blue  line, starts from an initial position,  , of 1.3 radians  74   and an initial  velocity,  , of 1.3 radians per second. The trajectory converges to the  equilibrium point   a2 0   a1 0   0=  a  .  Contour Plot  -10  -5  5  10  0 x1 a1  Figure 20.5  Pendulum Response on State Variable Plane  A time response plot of the two state variables is shown in Figure 20.6. No- tice that, because the initial velocity is positive, the pendulum continues to  move up initially.  Check to see if this agrees with Figure 20.5.  It reaches  a maximum angle of about 2 radians before falling back down. The oscilla- tions continue to decay as both state variables converge to zero.  In this case, both state variables converge to zero. However, this is not the  only possible equilibrium point, as we will show later.  It is also interesting to plot the pendulum energy,  , as in Figure 20.7. Re- call from Eq.  20.17  that the energy should never increase; this is consis- tent with Figure 20.7. Eq.  20.17  also predicts that the derivative of the  energy curve should only be zero when the velocity,  , is zero. This is also  verified if we compare Figure 20.7 with Figure 20.6. At those times where  the    graph crosses the zero axis, the slope of the energy curve is zero.   a2  V  a2  a2  2 x  0  2  1  -1  -2  20-10   Pendulum Example  a1  a2  2  1  0  -1  -2  0  160  120  80  40  0  0  20-11  V t   10  30  40  20 t  Figure 20.6  State Variables   a1    blue  and   a2   vs. Time  Notice that, although there are points where the derivative of the energy  curve is zero, the derivative does not remain zero until the energy is also  zero. This observation will lead to LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem, which we  will discuss in the next section. The key idea of that theorem is to identify  those points where the derivative of the Lyapunov function is zero, and  then to determine if the system will be trapped at those points.  Those plac- es where a trajectory can be trapped are called invariant sets.  If the only  point that can trap the trajectory, and that has zero derivative, is the ori- gin, then the origin is asymptotically stable.  10  30  40  20 t  20  Figure 20.7  Pendulum Lyapunov Function  Energy  vs. Time  The particular pendulum behavior shown in the graphs in this section de- pends on the initial conditions of the two state variables. The choice of a dif- ferent set of initial conditions may give results entirely different from those  shown in these plots. We will expand on this in the next section.   Lyapunov Function  Definitions Definition 5: Lyapunov Function  20 Stability  To experiment with the pendulum, use the Neural Network Design Demon- stration Dynamic System  nnd17ds .  LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem  The pendulum example demonstrated a problem with Lyapunov’s theorem.  We found a Lyapunov function whose derivative was only negative  semidefinite  not negative definite , and yet we know that the origin is as- ymptotically stable for the pendulum system. In this section we will intro- duce a theorem that clarifies this uncertainty in Lyapunov’s theorem. It  does so by defining those regions of the state space where the derivative of  the Lyapunov function is zero, and then identifying those parts of that re- gion that can trap the trajectory.   Before we discuss LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem, we first need to introduce  the following definitions.   be a continuously differentiable function from   n  to   is a Lyapunov function on  G  V    .

This is a generalization of our previous definition of the Lyapunov function,  which we used in Theorem 1. Here we do not require that the function be  positive definite. In fact, there is no direct requirement on the function it- self  except that it be continuously differentiable . The only requirement is  on the derivative of  . The derivative cannot change sign anywhere on the  set  semidefinite or if it is positive semidefinite.  . Note that the derivative will not change sign if it is negative   G  V  We should note here that we have not yet explained how to choose the set  . We will use the following definitions and theorems to help us select the  G best    for a given system.

This is, in essence, what LaSalle’s theorem will say.  Theorem LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem extends the Lyapunov Stability Theorem.  We will use it to design Hopfield networks in the next chapter. The theorem  proceeds as follows [Lasa67].

For nonlinear dynamic systems, like recurrent neural net- works, we do not talk about the stability of the system. Rather, we discuss  the stability of certain system trajectories and, in particular, equilibrium  points.  There were two main stability theorems discussed in this chapter. The first  is the Lyapunov Stability Theorem, which introduces the concept of gener- alized energy — the Lyapunov function. The concept behind this theorem  is that if a system’s “energy” is always decreasing, then it will eventually  stabilize at a point of minimum “energy.”  The second theorem presented was LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem, which is  an enhancement of the Lyapunov Stability Theorem. There are two key im- provements made by LaSalle. The first is a clarification of the cases in  which the Lyapunov function does not decrease throughout the state space,  but stays constant in some regions. LaSalle’s theorem introduced the con- cept of an invariant set to identify those regions that can trap the system  trajectory. The second improvement made by LaSalle’s theorem is that, in  addition to indicating the stability of equilibrium points, it also gave infor- mation about the regions of attraction of each stable point.  The ideas presented in this chapter are important tools for the analysis of  recurrent neural networks, like the Grossberg networks of Chapters 18 and  19.  See [CoGr83] for an application of LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem to re- current neural networks.  In Chapter 21 we will use LaSalle’s theorem to  explain the operation of the Hopfield network.  20-28   Further Reading  Further Reading  [Brog91]   W. L.

We will begin with a description of the  network, and then we will show how Lyapunov stability theory can be used  to analyze the network operation. Finally, we will demonstrate how the  network can be designed to behave as an associative memory.  This chapter brings together many topics discussed in previous chapters:  the discrete-time Hopfield network  Chapter 3 , eigenvalues and eigenvec- tors  Chapter 6 ; associative memory and the Hebb rule  Chapter 7 ; Hes- sian matrices, conditions for optimality, quadratic functions and surface  and contour plots  Chapter 8 ; steepest descent and phase plane trajecto- ries  Chapter 9 ; continuous-time recurrent networks  Chapter 18 ; and  Lyapunov’s Stability Theorem and LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem  Chapter  20 . This chapter is, in some ways, a culmination of all our previous efforts.  21  21-1   21 Hopfield Network  Theory and Examples  Much of the resurgence of interest in neural networks during the early  1980s can be attributed to the work of John Hopfield. As a well-known Cal.  Tech. physicist, Hopfield’s visibility and scientific credentials lent renewed  credibility to the neural network field, which had been tarnished by the  hype of the mid-1960s. Early in his career he studied the interaction be- tween light and solids. Later he focused on the mechanism of electron  transfer between biological molecules. One can imagine that his academic  study in physics and mathematics, combined with his later experiences in  biology, prepared him uniquely for the conception and presentation of his  neural network contribution.  Hopfield wrote two highly influential papers in 1982 [Hopf82] and 1984  [Hopf84]. Many of the ideas in these papers were based on the previous  work of other researchers, such as the neuron model of McCulloch and Pitts  [McPi43], the additive model of Grossberg [Gros67], the linear associator of  Anderson [Ande72] and Kohonen [Koho72] and the Brain-State-in-a-Box  network of Anderson, Silverstein, Ritz and Jones [AnSi77]. However,  Hopfield’s papers are very readable, and they bring together a number of  important ideas and present them with a clear mathematical analysis  in- cluding the application of Lyapunov stability theory .  There are several other reasons why Hopfield’s papers have had such an  impact. First, he identified a close analogy between his neural network and  the Ising model of magnetic materials, which is used in statistical physics.  This brought a significant amount of existing theory to bear on the analysis  of neural networks, and it encouraged many physicists, as well as other sci- entists and engineers, to turn their attention to neural network research.  Hopfield also had close contacts with VLSI chip designers, because of his  long association with AT&T Bell Laboratories. As early as 1987, Bell Labs  had successfully developed neural network chips based on the Hopfield net- work. One of the main promises of neural networks is their suitability for  parallel implementation in VLSI and optical devices. The fact that Hopfield  addressed the implementation issues of his networks distinguished him  from most previous neural network researchers.  Hopfield emphasized practicality, both in the implementation of his net- works and in the types of problems they solved. Some of the applications  that he described in his early papers include content-addressable memory   which we will discuss later in this chapter , analog-to-digital conversion  [TaHo86], and optimization [HoTa85]  as in the traveling salesman prob- lem .  In the next section we will present the Hopfield model. We will use the con- tinuous-time model from the 1984 paper [Hopf84]. Then we will apply  Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem to the analy-  21-2   Hopfield Model  sis of the Hopfield model. In the final section we will demonstrate how the  Hebb rule can be used to design Hopfield networks as content-addressable  memories.  Hopfield Model  Hopfield Model  In keeping with his practical viewpoint, Hopfield presented his model as an  electrical circuit. The basic Hopfield model  see [Hopf84]  is shown in Fig- ure 21.1.

There are two sets of inputs to the neurons. The  first set, represented by the currents  , are constant external inputs.  The other set consists of feedback connections from other op-amps. For in- stance, the second output,  , which is connected, in  a2 turn, to the input of amplifier  . Resistors are, of course, only positive, but  a negative input to a neuron can be obtained by selecting the inverted out- put of a particular amplifier.

Cohen and Gross- berg also used Lyapunov theory for the analysis of competitive networks at  about the same time [CoGr83].  In this section we will demonstrate how  LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem, which was presented in Chapter 20, can be  used with the Hopfield network. The first step in using LaSalle’s theorem  is to choose a Lyapunov function. Hopfield suggested the following func- tion:  V a   =  –  1 ---aTWa 2  +  S    i  1=  ai   0              f 1– u  ud  bTa  .  –   21.8   Hopfield’s choice of this particular Lyapunov candidate is one of his key  contributions. Notice that the first and third terms make up a quadratic  function. In a later section of this chapter we will use our previous results  on quadratic functions to help develop some insight into this Lyapunov  function.  To use LaSalle’s theorem, we will need to evaluate the derivative of  For clarity, we will consider each of the three terms of  ing Eq.  8.37 , the derivative of the first term is  .   separately.

Using Eq.  8.36 , we can find the derivative of the third term in   V a   .  –  bTa    =  –      bTa    d td  Tda ------ dt  =  –  bTda ------ dt  Therefore, the total derivative of   V a    is  d td  V a   =  –  aTWda ------ dt  +  nTda ------ bTda ------ dt dt  –  =  aTW–    +  nT bT–   21.13   da ------ dt  .  From Eq.  21.6  we know that   aTW–    nT bT–    +  =  –  dn t    ------------  dt  T  .

Invariant Sets Now we want to apply LaSalle’s Invariance Theorem to determine equilib- rium points for the Hopfield network. The first step is to find the set    Eq.   20.19  .  Z  Z  =    a: dV a  dt     0=   a in the closure of G     21.20   This set includes all points at which the derivative of the Lyapunov func- tion is zero. For now, let’s assume that    is all of   S  G  .  We can see from Eq.  21.17  that such derivatives will be zero if the deriv- atives of all of the neuron outputs are zero.  da ------ dt  0=   21.21   However, when the derivatives of the outputs are zero, the circuit is at  equilibrium. Thus, those points where the system “energy” is not changing  are also points where the circuit is at equilibrium.  This means that the set  to   Z  .  L  , the largest invariant set in   Z  , is exactly equal   L  Z=   21.22   Thus, all points in   Z   are potential attractors.  Some of these features will be illustrated in the following example.  21  21-7   21 Hopfield Network  2 2+  Example Consider the following example from Hopfield’s original paper [Hopf84].  We will examine a system having an amplifier characteristic    21.23    21.24    21.26    21.27    21.28   We can also write this expression as  a  =  f n   =  2 ---tan 1–     n  ---------  2  .  n  =  2 ------tan     ---a  2  .  Assume two amplifiers, with the output of each connected to the input of  the other through a unit resistor, so that  R1 2  =  R2 1  =  1   and   T1 2  =  T2 1  =  1  .   21.25   Thus we have a weight matrix   If the amplifier input capacitance is also set to 1, we have  Let us also take     =  1.4   and   I1  =  I2  =  0  . Therefore  W  =  0 1 1 0  .    =  RiC  =  1  .  b  =  .  0 0  Recall from Eq.  21.8  that the Lyapunov function is  V a   =  –  1 ---aTWa 2  +  S    i  1=        ai   0        f 1– u  ud  bTa  .  –   21.29   The first term of the Lyapunov function, for this example, is  –  1 ---aTWa 2  =  –  1 --- a1 a2 2  0 1 1 0  a1 a2  =  –  a1a2  .   21.30   21-8   Lyapunov Function  The third term is zero, because the biases are zero.

With  b  , it is  0=    1=   and   dn ------ dt  =  n– Wf n  +    =  n– Wa  +  .   21.34   If we substitute the weight matrix of Eq.  21.26 , this expression can be  written as the following pair of equations:  The neuron outputs are  dn1 dt    a2  n1–  dn2 dt    a1  n2–  =  =  ,  .  a1  =  2  ---tan 1– 1.4  -----------n1      2  a2  =  2  ---tan 1– 1.4  -----------n2      2  ,  .   21.35    21.36    21.37    21.38   Now that we have found expressions for the system Lyapunov function and  the network equation of operation, let’s investigate the network behavior.  The Lyapunov function contour and a sample trajectory are shown in Fig- ure 21.3.  21  21-9   21 Hopfield Network  2  1  0  1  1  0.5  a2  0  -0.5  -1 -1  -0.5  0.5  1  0  a1  0.5  0  a2  -0.5  1  0.5  -0.5  0  a1  -1  -1  Figure 21.3  Hopfield Example Lyapunov Function and Trajectory  The contour lines in this figure represent constant values of the Lyapunov  function. The system has two attractors, one in the lower left and one in the  upper right of Figure 21.3. Starting from the upper left, the system con- verges, as shown by the blue line, to the stable point at the lower left.  Figure 21.4 displays the time response of the two neuron outputs.  2  4  6  8  10  t  Figure 21.4  Hopfield Example Time Response  Figure 21.5 displays the time response of the Lyapunov function. As ex- pected, it decreases continuously as the equilibrium point is approached.  The system also has an equilibrium point at the origin. If the network is  initialized anywhere on a diagonal line drawn from the upper-left corner to  the lower-right corner, the solution converges to the origin. Any initial con- ditions that do not fall on this line, however, will converge to one of the so- lutions in the lower-left or upper-right corner. The solution at the origin is  a saddle point of the Lyapunov function, not a local minimum.

This example has provided some insight into the Hopfield attractors. In the  next section we will analyze them more carefully.  Hopfield Attractors In the example network in the previous section we found that the Hopfield  network attractors were stationary points of the Lyapunov function. Now  we want to show that this is true in the general case. Recall from Eq.   21.21  that the potential attractors of the Hopfield network satisfy   21  V a   1  2  1.5  0.5  0  0  1  0.5  a2  0  -0.5  21-11   21 Hopfield Network  da ------ dt  0=  .  How are these points related to the minima of the Lyapunov function  ?  In Chapter 8  Eq.  8.27   we showed that the minima of a function must be  stationary points  i.e., gradient equal to zero . The stationary points of  V a    will satisfy   V a   V  =  V a1  V a2   ...   V aS  T  =  0  ,  where  V a   =  –  1 ---aTWa 2  +  S    i  1=        ai   0        f 1– u  ud  bTa  .  –   21.41   If we follow steps similar to those we used to derive Eq.  21.13 , we can find  the following expression for the gradient:    V a   =    W–  a n b–+    =  –   21.42   dn t    ------------  dt  .  The ith element of the gradient is therefore   ai  V a   =  –  =  –      f 1– ai         =  –    f 1– ai      dni td  d td  dai td  .  d aid   21.43   Notice, incidentally, that if   f 1– a    is linear, Eq.  21.43  implies that  Therefore, the response of the Hopfield network is steepest descent. Thus,  if you are in a region where   is approximately linear, the network so- lution approximates steepest descent.  f 1– a   We have assumed that the transfer function and its inverse are monotonic  increasing functions.

V a   .  Effect of Gain  The Hopfield Lyapunov function can be simplified if we consider those cas- es where the amplifier gain   is large. Recall that the nonlinear amplifier  characteristic for our previous example was     a  =  f n   =  2 ---tan 1–     n  ---------  2  .   21.48   This function is displayed in Figure 21.7 for four different gain values.    14=    =  1.4    =  0.14  -2.5  2.5  5  0 n  Figure 21.7  Inverse Tangent Amplifier Characteristic     determines the steepness of the curve at   The gain  the slope of the curve at the origin increases.

Note that as    0 most of the time. Thus, as the gain   goes to infinity, the integral in the  second term of the Lyapunov function will be close to zero in the range  – Lyapunov function then reduces to   .

Recall that the shape of the surface of a quadratic function is determined  by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its Hessian matrix. The Hessian  matrix for our example Lyapunov function is  2  V a   =  W–  =  0 1–  1– 0  .   21.55   The eigenvalues of this Hessian matrix are computed as follows:  2  V a   I–  =     =  2 1–  =   1+    1–    .   21.56   – 1–  1– –  Thus, the eigenvalues are  vectors are  1  1–=   and   2  1=  . It follows that the eigen-  z1  =   and   z2  =  .  1 1–   21.57   What does the surface of the high-gain Lyapunov function look like? We  know, since the Hessian matrix has one positive and one negative eigenval- ue, that we have a saddle point condition. The surface will have a negative  curvature along the first eigenvector and a positive curvature along the  second eigenvector. The surface is shown in Figure 21.9.  The function does not have a minimum. However, the network is con- strained to the hypercube  tion.

The type of associative memory we will de- sign is called a content-addressable memory, because it retrieves stored  memories on the basis of part of the contents. This is in contrast to stan- dard computer memories, where items are retrieved based on their ad- dresses. For example, if we have a content-addressable data base that  contains names, addresses and phone numbers of employees, we can re- trieve a complete data entry simply by providing the employee name  or   21-16  Content-Addressable Memory   Hopfield Design  perhaps a partial name . The content-addressable memory is effectively  the same as the autoassociative memory described in Chapter 7  see page  7-10 , except that in this chapter we will use the recurrent Hopfield net- work instead of the linear associator.  Suppose that we want to store a set of prototype patterns in a Hopfield net- work. When an input pattern is presented to the network, the network  should produce the stored pattern that most closely resembles the input  pattern. The initial network output is assigned to the input pattern. The  network output should then converge to the prototype pattern closest to the  input pattern. For this to happen, the prototype patterns must be minima  of the Lyapunov function.  Let’s assume that the prototype patterns are    p1 p2   pQ          .   21.61   .

Since the high-gain  Lyapunov function is quadratic, we need the prototype patterns to be  con- strained  minima of an appropriate quadratic function. We propose the fol- lowing quadratic performance index:  J a   Q  –=  1 --- 2  q  1=    pq  Ta  2  .   21.62   If the elements of the vectors  imized at the prototype patterns, as we will now show.   are restricted to be   1  a  , this function is min-  Assume that the prototype patterns are orthogonal. If we evaluate the per- formance index at one of the prototype patterns, we find   J pj    =  Q  1 – --- 2  q  1=    pq  Tpj  2  =  –  1  --- pj 2    Tpj  2  =  S ---– 2  .   21.63   The second equality follows from the orthogonality of the prototype pat- terns. The last equality follows because all elements of    are   1  .  pj  Next, evaluate the performance index at a random input pattern  , which  is presumably not close to any prototype pattern. Each element in the sum  in Eq.  21.62  is an inner product between a prototype pattern and the in- put. The inner product will increase as the input moves closer to a proto-  a  21  21-17   21 Hopfield Network  type pattern. However, if the input is not close to any prototype pattern,  then all terms of the sum in Eq.  21.62  will be small.

The next step is to choose the  weight matrix   will  be equivalent to the quadratic performance index    so that the Hopfield Lyapunov function    and bias   W  V  b  J  .  If we use the supervised Hebb rule to compute the weight matrix  with tar- get patterns being the same as input patterns  as  W  =   pq  pq  T  ,  Q  q  1=  b  0=  ,  and set the bias to zero  then the Lyapunov function is   21.64    21.65   V a   =  –  1 ---aTWa 2  =  –  1 ---aT 2   pq  pq  T a  =  –  aTpq  pq  Ta  .   21.66   Q    1 --- 2  q  1=  This can be rewritten  V a   =    pq  Ta  2  =  J a   .   21.67   Q  q  1=  1 ---– 2  Q    q  1=  Therefore, the Lyapunov function is indeed equal to the quadratic perfor- mance index for the content-addressable memory problem. The Hopfield  network output will tend to converge to the stored prototype patterns   among other possible equilibrium points, as we will discuss later .   As noted in Chapter 7, the supervised Hebb rule does not work well if there  is significant correlation between the prototype patterns. In that case the  pseudoinverse technique has been suggested. Another design technique,  which is beyond the scope of this text, is given in [LiMi89].  In the best situation, where the prototype patterns are orthogonal, every  prototype pattern will be an equilibrium point of the network. However,  there will be many other equilibrium points as well. The network may well  converge to a pattern that is not one of the prototype patterns. A general  rule is that, when using the Hebb rule, the number of stored patterns can   21-18   Hopfield Design  be no more than 15% of the number of neurons.The reference [LiMi89] dis- cusses more complex design procedures, which minimize the number of  spurious equilibrium points.  In the next section we will analyze the location of the equilibrium points  more closely.  Hebb Rule Let’s take a closer look at the operation of the Hopfield network when the  Hebb rule is used to compute the weight matrix and the prototype patterns  are orthogonal.  The following analysis follows the discussion in the Chap- ter 7, Problem P7.5.  The supervised Hebb rule is given by  Q  q  1=  pj  Q    q  1=  W  =   pq  pq  T  .   21.68   If we apply the prototype vector    to the network, then  Wpj  =  pq pq  Tpj  =  pj pj    Tpj  =  Spj  ,   21.69   where the second equality holds because the prototype patterns are orthog- onal, and the third equality holds because each element of   or  1–  . Eq.  21.69  is of the form   is either   pj  1  Wpj  =  pj  .   21.70   Therefore, each prototype vector is an eigenvector of the weight matrix and  they have a common eigenvalue of   for the eigen- value   . The eigenspace    is therefore  S=  S=      X  X  =  span p1, p2,  ... ,pQ      .   21.71   This space contains all vectors that can be written as linear combinations  of the prototype vectors. That is, any vector   that is a linear combination  of the prototype vectors is an eigenvector.  a  Wa W 1p1 2p2  =  +    +   QpQ  +      1Wp1 2Wp2  +  +   QWpQ  +      1Sp1 2Sp2  +  +   QSpQ  +    =  =  =  21-19  S 1p1 2p2   +  +   QpQ  +    =  Sa   21.72   21   21 Hopfield Network  The eigenspace for the eigenvalue  S= the prototype vectors are independent .     is Q-dimensional  assuming that   The entire space   RS   can be divided into two disjoint sets [Brog85],  RS  X=  X  ,   21.73   X   is the orthogonal complement of   where  not just the one we are considering here.

The objective of Hopfield network design is to minimize the  number of spurious patterns and to make the basins of attraction for each  of the prototype patterns as large as possible. A design method that is guar- anteed to minimize the number of spurious patterns is described in  [LiMi89].  ai        1  2 2+  To illustrate these principles, consider again the second-order example we  have been discussing, where the connection matrix is  Suppose that this had been designed using the Hebb rule with one proto- type pattern  obviously not an interesting practical case :  W  =  0 1 1 0  .  p1  =  .  1 1  Then  Notice that   W p1 p1  =  T  =  1 1  =  1 1  1 1 1 1  .

Initial points to the right or to the left of the ridge, in both systems,  converge to the prototype design points. Thus, the convergence of our orig- inal system, and the convergence of the system with zero diagonal ele- ments, are identical in every important aspect.

The network does not do a good job on the pattern recognition problem.  Not only does it recognize the two prototype patterns, but it also “recogniz- es” the other two corners of the hypercube as well. The network will con- verge to whichever corner is closest to the input pattern, even though we  only wanted it to store the two prototype patterns. Since every possible   21-32   Solved Problems  two-bit pattern has been stored, the network is not very useful. This is not  unexpected, since the number of patterns that the Hebb rule is expected to  store is only 15% of the number of neurons. Since we only have two neu- rons, we can’t expect to successfully store many patterns. Try Exercise  E21.2 for a better network.

One of the reasons that Hopfield  was so influential was that he emphasized the practical considerations of  the network. He described how the network could be implemented as an  electrical circuit, and VLSI implementations of Hopfield-type networks  were built at an early stage.   Hopfield also explained how the network could be used to solve practical  problems in pattern recognition and optimization. Some of the applications  that Hopfield proposed for his networks were: content-addressable memory  [Hopf82], A D conversion [TaHo86] and linear programming and optimiza- tion tasks, such as the traveling salesman problem [HoTa85].  One of Hopfield’s key contributions was the application of Lyapunov stabil- ity theory to the analysis of his recurrent networks. He also showed that,  for high-gain amplifiers, the Lyapunov function for his network was a qua- dratic function, which was minimized by the network. This led to several  design procedures. The idea behind the development of the design tech- niques was to convert a given task into a quadratic minimization problem,  which the network could then solve.  The Hopfield network is the last topic we will cover in any detail in this  text. However, we have certainly not exhausted all of the important neural  network architectures. In the next chapter we will give you some ideas  about where to go next to explore the subject further.  21  21-37   21 Hopfield Network  Further Reading  [Ande72]   J.

Repeat this process 10 times, and record  the percentage of times in which the correct pattern  without noise   is produced at the output of the network. Repeat as 4 and 6 pixels of  each digit are modified. The entire process is then repeated when  the digits “0”, “1” and “2” are used. This continues, one digit at a  time, until you test the network when all of the digits “0” through  “6” are used. When you have completed all of the tests, you will be  able to plot three curves showing percentage error versus number of  digits stored, one curve each for 2, 4 and 6 pixel errors.  ii.

In  this chapter, we will discuss some practical training tips that apply to a va- riety of networks. No derivations are provided for the techniques that are  presented here, but we have found these methods to be useful in practice.  There will be three basic sections in this chapter. The first section describes  things that need to be done prior to training a network, such as collecting  and preprocessing data and selecting the network architecture. The second  section addresses network training itself. The final section considers post- training analysis.  22-1  22   22 Practical Training Issues  Theory and Examples  In previous chapters, we have discussed a variety of neural network archi- tectures and learning rules. Those chapters have placed special emphasis  on the fundamental concepts behind each network. In this chapter, we will  concentrate on practical aspects of training neural networks. Theoretical  aspects and practical aspects are not mutually exclusive. It is only by com- bining a deep knowledge of network fundamentals with practical experi- ence in using neural networks that we can get the most out of this  technology.  Figure 22.1 illustrates the neural network training process. It is an itera- tive procedure that begins by collecting data and preprocessing it to make  training more efficient. At this stage, the data also needs to be divided into  training validation testing sets  see Chapter 13 . After the data is selected,  we need to choose the appropriate network type  multilayer, competitive,  dynamic, etc.  and architecture  e.g., number of layers, number of neurons .  Then we select a training algorithm that is appropriate for the network and  the problem we are trying to solve. After the network is trained, we want  to analyze the performance of the network. This analysis may lead us to  discover problems with the data, the network architecture, or the training  algorithm. The entire process is then iterated until the network perfor- mance is satisfactory.

We have divided this material into three major sec- tions: Pre-Training Steps, Training the Network, and Post-Training Anal- ysis.  22-2   Pre-Training Steps  Pre-Training Steps  Before we dig into the details of training, it is worth making a preliminary  comment. Before beginning the neural network training process, you  should first determine if a neural network is needed to solve your problem,  or if some simpler linear technique might be adequate. For example, there  is no need to use a neural network for a fitting problem, if standard linear  regression will produce a satisfactory result. The neural network tech- niques provide additional power, but at the expense of more challenging  training requirements. When linear methods will work, they are the first  choice.  There are a number of steps that need to be performed before the network  is trained. They can be grouped into three categories: Selection of Data,  Data Preprocessing, and Choice of Network Type and Architecture.  Selection of Data It is generally difficult to incorporate prior knowledge into a neural net- work, therefore the network will only be as good as the data that is used to  train it. Neural networks represent a technology that is at the mercy of the  data. The training data must span the full range of the input space for  which the network will be used. As we discussed in Chapter 13, there are  training methods we can use to insure that the network interpolates accu- rately throughout the range of the data provided  generalizes well . How- ever, it is not possible to guarantee network performance when the inputs  to the network are outside the range of the training set. Neural networks,  like other nonlinear “black box” methods, do not extrapolate well.  It is not always easy to be sure that the input space is adequately sampled  by the training data. For simple problems, in which the dimension of the  input vector is small, and each element of the input vector can be chosen  independently, we can sample the input space using a grid. However, these  conditions are not often satisfied. For many problems, the dimension of the  input space is large, which precludes the use of grid sampling. In addition,  it is often the case that the input variables are dependent. For example,  consider Figure 22.2. The shaded area represents the range over which the  two inputs can vary. Even though each variable can range from -1 to 1, we  would not need to create a grid in which both variables vary throughout  their range, as shown by the dots in Figure 22.2. The network only needs  to fit the function in the shaded area, since this is where the network will  be used. It would be inefficient to fit the network outside the range of its  use. This is especially true when the input dimension is large.  22-3  22   22 Practical Training Issues  p2  p1  Figure 22.2  Input Range With Dependent Input Variables  It may not be possible to precisely define the active region of the input  space. However, we can often collect data during standard operation of the  system we are trying to model. In some cases, we have complete control  over the design of the experiment during which data is collected. In these  cases, we must be sure that the experimental setup drives the system  through all conditions for which we plan to use the network.  How can we be sure that the input space has been adequately sampled by  the training data? This is difficult to do prior to training, and there are  many cases in which we have no control over the data collection process  and must use whatever data is available. We will come back to this subject  in the Post-Training Analysis section on page 22-18. By analyzing the  trained network, we can often tell if the training data was sufficient. In ad- dition, we can use techniques that indicate when a network is being used  outside the range of the data with which it was trained. This will not im- prove the network performance, but it will prevent us from using a network  in situations where it is not reliable.  After collecting the data, we generally divide it into three sets: training,  validation and testing. As we discussed in Chapter 13, the training set will  generally make up approximately 70% of the full data set, with validation  and testing making up approximately 15% each. It is important that each  of these sets be representative of the full data set — that the validation and  test sets cover the same region of the input space as the training set. The  simplest method for dividing the data is to select each set at random from  the full data set. This usually produces a good result, but it is best to review  the division to check for major differences between the sets. It is also pos- sible in the post-training analysis to detect problems in the data division.  We will have more to say about that later.  A final question we must ask about the selection of data is “Do we have  enough data?” This is difficult to answer, especially before we train the net-  22-4   Pre-Training Steps  work. The amount of data that is required depends on the complexity of the  underlying function that we are trying to approximate  or the complexity  of the decision boundaries that we are trying to implement . If the function  to be approximated is very complex, with many inflection points, then this  requires a large amount of data. If the function is very smooth, then the  data requirements are significantly reduced  unless the data is very noisy .  The choice of the data set size is closely related to the choice of the number  of neurons in the neural network. This is discussed in the Choice of Net- work Architecture section on page 22-8. Of course, we generally don’t know  how complex the underlying function is before we begin training the net- work. For this reason, as we discussed earlier, the entire neural network  training process is iterative. At the completion of training we will analyze  the performance of the network. The results of that analysis can help us de- cide if we have enough data or not.  Data Preprocessing The main purpose of the data preprocessing stage is to facilitate network  training. Data preprocessing consists of such steps as normalization, non- linear transformations, feature extraction, coding of discrete inputs tar- gets, handling of missing data, etc. The idea is to perform preliminary  processing of the data to make it easier for the neural network training to  extract the relevant information.      exp  3–  0.05  For example, in multilayer networks, sigmoid transfer functions are often  used in the hidden layers. These functions become essentially saturated  when the net input is greater than three    . We don’t want  this to happen at the beginning of the training process, because the gradi- ent will then be very small. In the first layer, the net input is a product of  the input times the weight plus the bias. If the input is very large, then the  weight must be small in order to prevent the transfer function from becom- ing saturated. It is standard practice to normalize the inputs before apply- ing them to the network. In this way, initializing the network weights to  small random values guarantees that the weight-input product will be  small. Also, when the input values are normalized, the magnitudes of the  weights have a consistent meaning. This is especially important when us- ing regularization, as described in Chapter 13. Regularization requires the  weight values to be small. However, “small” is a relative term; if the input  values are very small, we need large weights to produce a significant net  input. Normalizing the inputs clarifies the meaning of “small” weights.  Normalization  There are two standard methods for normalization. The first method nor- malizes the data so that they fall into a standard range — typically -1 to 1.  This can be done with  pn  =  2 p pmin –  .  pmax pmin  –     1–  ,   22.1   pmin  where  the input vectors in the data set,   pmax   is the vector containing the minimum values of each element of    contains the maximum values,   .      22  22-5   22 Practical Training Issues  represents an element-by-element division of two vectors, and  sulting normalized input vector.  pn   is the re-  An alternative normalization procedure is to adjust the data so that they  have a specified mean and variance — typically 0 and 1. This can be done  with the transformation  pn  =  p pmean –  . pstd  ,   22.2  pstd  pmean   is the average of the input vectors in the data set, and   where   is  the vector containing the standard deviations of each element of the input  vectors.  Generally, the normalization step is applied to both the input vectors and  the target vectors in the data set.  In addition to normalization, which involves a linear transformation, non- linear transformations are sometimes also performed as part of the pre- processing stage. Unlike normalization, which is a standard process that  can be applied to any data set, these nonlinear transformations are case- specific. For example, many economic variables show a logarithmic depen- dence [BoJe94]. In that case, it might be appropriate to take the logarithm  of the input values before applying them to the neural network. Another  example is molecular dynamics simulation [RaMa05], in which atomic forc- es are calculated as functions of distances between atoms. Since it is known  that the forces are inversely related to the distances, we might perform the  reciprocal transformation on the inputs, before applying them to the net- work. This represents one way of incorporating prior knowledge into neural  network training. If the nonlinear transformation is cleverly chosen, it can  make the network training more efficient. The preprocessing will off-load  some of the work required of the neural network in finding the underlying  transformation between inputs and targets.  Another data preprocessing step is called feature extraction. This generally  applies to situations in which the dimension of the raw input vectors is very  large and the components of the input vector are redundant. The idea of  feature extraction is to reduce the dimension of the input space by calculat- ing a small set of features from each input vector, and using the features  as the input to the neural network. For example, neural networks can be  used to analyze EKG  electrocardiogram  signals to identify heart prob- lems [HeOh97]. The EKG might involve 12 or 15 signals  leads  measured  over several minutes at a high sampling rate. This is too much data to ap- ply directly to the neural network. Instead, we would extract certain fea- tures from the EKG signal, such as average time intervals between certain  waveforms, average amplitudes of certain waves, etc.  See Chapter 25.   There are also certain general-purpose feature extraction methods. One of  these is the method of principal component analysis  PCA  [Joll02]. This  method transforms the original input vectors so that the components of the   22-6  Nonlinear Transformation  Feature Extraction  Principal Components   Coding the Targets  Pre-Training Steps  transformed vectors are uncorrelated. In addition, the components of the  transformed vector are ordered such that the first component has the  greatest variance, the second component has the next greatest variance,  etc. We generally keep only the first few components of the transformed  vector, which account for most of the variance in the original vector. This  results in a large reduction in the dimension of the input vector, if the orig- inal components are highly correlated. The drawback of using PCA is that  it only considers linear relationships between the components of the input  vector. When reducing the dimension using a linear transformation, we  might lose some nonlinear information. Since the main purpose of using  neural networks is to gain the power of their nonlinear mapping capabili- ties, we should be careful when using principal components to reduce the  input dimension before applying the inputs to the neural network. There is  a nonlinear version of PCA, called kernel PCA [ScSm99].  Another important preprocessing step is needed whenever the inputs or  targets take on only discrete values. For example, in pattern recognition  problems, each target will represent one of a finite number of classes. In  these cases we need to have a procedure for coding the inputs or targets. If  we have a pattern recognition problem in which there are four classes,  there are at least three common ways in which we could code the targets.  First, we can have scalar targets that take on four possible values  e.g., 1,  2, 3, 4 . Second, we can have two-dimensional targets, which represent a  binary code of the four classes  e.g.,  0,0 ,  0,1 ,  1,0 ,  1,1  . Third, we can  have four-dimensional targets, in which only one neuron at a time is active   e.g.,  1,0,0,0 ,  0,1,0,0 ,  0,0,1,0 ,  0,0,0,1  . The third method tends to yield  the best results in our experience.  Note that discrete inputs can be coded  in the same ways as discrete targets.   When coding the target values, we also need to consider the transfer func- tion that is used in the output layer of the network. For pattern recognition  problems, we would typically use sigmoid functions: log-sigmoid or tan- gent-sigmoid. If we use the tangent-sigmoid in the last layer, which is more  common, then we might consider assigning target values to -1 or 1, which  represent the asymptotes of the function. However, this tends to cause dif- ficulties for the training algorithm, which tries to saturate the sigmoid  function to meet the target value. It is better to assign target values at the  point where the second derivative of the sigmoid function is maximum  see  [LeCu98] . For the tangent-sigmoid function, this occurs when the net in- put is -1 and 1, which corresponds to output values of -0.76 and +0.76.  Softmax  Another transfer function that is used in the output layer of multilayer pat- tern recognition networks is the softmax function. This transfer function  has the form  ai  =  f ni    =  exp  ni    exp  nj    .   22.3   S    j  1=  22  22-7   Missing Data  22 Practical Training Issues  The outputs of the softmax transfer function can be interpreted as the prob- abilities associated with each class. Each output will fall between 0 and 1,  and the sum of the outputs will equal 1. See Chapter 24 for an example ap- plication of the softmax transfer function.  Another practical issue to consider is missing data. It is often the case, es- pecially when dealing with economic data, for example, that some of the  data is missing. For instance, we might have an input vector containing 20  economic variables that are collected at monthly intervals. There may be  some months in which one or two of the 20 variables were not collected  properly. The simplest solution to this problem would be to throw out the  data for any month in which any of the variables were missing. However,  we might be very limited in the amount of data available, and it might be  very expensive to collect additional data. In these cases, we would like to  make full use of any data that we have, even if it is incomplete.  There are several strategies for dealing with missing data. If the missing  data occurs in an input variable, one possibility is to replace the missing  value with the average value for that particular input variable. At the same  time, we could add an additional flag element to the input vector that  would indicate that missing data for that input variable had been replaced  with the average. This additional element of the input vector could be as- signed the value 1 when the input variable was available, and 0 when the  input variable was missing for that case. This would provide the neural  network with information about which variables were missing. An addi- tional flag element would be added to the input vector for every input vari- able that contained missing points.  If the missing data occurs in an element of the target, then the performance  index can be modified so that errors associated with the missing target val- ues are not included. All known target values will contribute to the perfor- mance index, but missing target values will not.  Choice of Network Architecture The next step in the network training process is the choice of network ar- chitecture. The basic type of network architecture is determined by the  type of problem we wish to solve. Once the basic architecture is chosen, we  need to decide such specific details as how many neurons and layers we  want to use, how many outputs the network should have, and what type of  performance function we want to use for training.  Choice of Basic Architecture  The first step in choosing the architecture is to define the problem that we  are trying to solve. For this chapter, we will limit our discussion to four  types of problems: fitting, pattern recognition, clustering and prediction.  Fitting  Fitting is also referred to as function approximation or regression. In fitting  problems, you want a neural network to map between a set of inputs and a   22-8   Pre-Training Steps  corresponding set of targets. For example, a realtor might want to estimate  home prices from such input variables as tax rate, pupil teacher ratio in lo- cal schools and crime rate. An automotive engineer might want to estimate  engine emission levels based on measurements of fuel consumption and  speed. A physician might want to predict a patient's body fat level based on  body measurements. For fitting problems, the target variable takes on con- tinuous values.  For an example of training a neural network for a fitting  problem, see Chapter 23.   The standard neural network architecture for fitting problems is the mul- tilayer perceptron, with tansig neurons in the hidden layers, and linear  neurons in the output layer. The tansig transfer function is generally pre- ferred over the logsig transfer function in the hidden layers for the same  reason that inputs are normalized. It produces outputs  which are inputs  to the next layer  that are centered near zero, whereas the logsig transfer  function always produces positive outputs. For most fitting problems, a sin- gle hidden layer is sufficient. If the results with one hidden layer are not  satisfactory, two layers are sometimes used. It would be rare in a standard  fitting problem to use more than two hidden layers, although, for very dif- ficult problems, deep networks, with many layers, have been used. Linear  transfer functions are used in the output layer for fitting problems, because  the target output is a continuous variable. As we saw in Chapter 11, a two  layer network with sigmoid transfer functions in the hidden layer and lin- ear transfer functions in the output layer is a universal approximator.  Radial basis networks can also be used for fitting problems. The Gaussian  transfer function is most commonly used in the hidden layer for these net- works, with linear transfer functions in the output layer.  Pattern recognition is also referred to as pattern classification. In pattern  recognition problems, you want a neural network to classify inputs into a  set of target categories. For example, a wine dealer might want to recognize  the vineyard that a particular bottle of wine came from, based on a chemi- cal analysis of the wine. A physician might want to classify a tumor as be- nign or malignant, based on uniformity of cell size, clump thickness and  mitosis.  In addition to fitting problems, multilayer perceptrons can be used for pat- tern recognition. The main difference between a fitting network and a pat- tern recognition network is the transfer function used in the output layer.  For pattern recognition problems, we generally use a sigmoid function in  the output layer. The radial basis function network can also be used for pat- tern recognition.   For an example of training a neural network for a pattern recognition prob- lem, see Chapter 25.  Pattern Recognition  Clustering  Clustering, or segmentation, is another use for neural networks. In cluster- ing problems, you want a neural network to group data by similarity. For  example, businesses may wish to perform market segmentation, which is   22  22-9   Prediction  22 Practical Training Issues  done by grouping people according to their buying patterns. Computer sci- entists may want to perform data mining by partitioning data into related  subsets. Biologists may wish to perform bioinformatic analyses, such as  grouping genes with related expression patterns.  Any of the competitive networks described in Chapter 16 could be used for  clustering. The self-organizing feature map  SOFM  is the most popular  network for clustering. The main advantage of the SOFM is that it allows  visualization of high-dimensional spaces.  For an example of training a neural network for a clustering problem, see  Chapter 26.  Prediction also falls under the categories of time series analysis, system  identification, filtering or dynamic modeling. The idea is that we wish to  predict the future value of some time series. An equities trader might want  to predict the future value of some security. A control engineer might want  to predict a future value of the concentration of some chemical, which is the  output of a processing plant. A power systems engineer might want to pre- dict outages on the electric grid.  Prediction requires the use of dynamic neural networks, as discussed in  Chapter 14. The specific form of the network will depend on the particular  application. The simplest network for nonlinear prediction is the focused  time-delay neural network, which is shown in Figure 22.3. This is part of a  general class of dynamic networks, called focused networks, in which the  dynamics appear only at the input layer of a static multilayer feedforward  network. This network has the advantage that it can be trained using static  backpropagation algorithms, since the tapped-delay-line at the input of the  network can be replaced with an extended vector of delayed values of the  input.

This net- work is shown in Figure 22.4. The input signal could represent, for   22-10   Pre-Training Steps  example, the voltage applied to a motor, and the output could represent the  angular position of a robot arm. As with the focused time-delay neural net- work, the NARX network can be trained with static backpropagation. The  two tapped-delay-lines can be replaced with extended vectors of delayed in- puts and targets. We can use targets, instead of feeding back the network  outputs  which would require dynamic backpropagation for training , be- cause the output of the network should match the targets when training is  complete.This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 27.

For an example of training a neural network for a prediction problem, see  Chapter 27.  Selection of Architecture Specifics  After the basic network structure is chosen, we want to select the specifics  of the architecture  e.g., the number of layers, the number of neurons, etc. .  In some cases, the basic architecture choice will automatically determine  the number of layers. For example, if the SOFM is used for clustering, then  the network will have one layer. In the case of the multilayer network,  which can be used for fitting or pattern recognition, the number of hidden  layers is not determined by the problem, since any number of hidden layers  is possible. The standard procedure is to begin with a network with one hid- den layer. If the performance of the two-layer network is not satisfactory,  then a three-layer network can be used. It would be unusual to use more  than two hidden layers. The training becomes more difficult when multiple  hidden layers are used. This is because each layer performs a squashing op- eration, as sigmoid functions are used in the hidden layers. This causes the   22-11  22   22 Practical Training Issues  derivatives of the performance function with respect to weights in the early  layers to be quite small, which can cause slow convergence for steepest de- scent optimization. For very difficult problems, however, deep networks,  with several hidden layers, can be used. Typically, parallel or GPU comput- ing is required to train deep multilayer networks within a reasonable  amount of time.  We also need to select the number of neurons in each layer. The number of  neurons in the output layer is the same as the size of the target vector. The  numbers of neurons in the hidden layers are determined by the complexi- ties of the function that is being approximated or the decision boundaries  that are being implemented. Unfortunately, we don’t normally know how  complex the problem is until we try to train the network. The standard pro- cedure is to begin with more neurons than necessary and then to use early  stopping or Bayesian regularization to prevent overfitting, as was de- scribed in Chapter 13.   The principal drawback to having too many neurons is that the network  may overfit the data. If we use early stopping or Bayesian regularization,  then we can prevent overfitting. However, there may be some situations in  which we are concerned with the computation time or space required by the  network  e.g., for real-time implementation on microcontrollers, VLSI or  FPGAs . In these cases we want to find the simplest network that will fit  the data. If you use Bayesian regularization, the effective number of pa- rameters can be used to determine how many neurons to use. If, after train- ing, the effective number of parameters is much less than the total number  of parameters in the network, then the number of neurons can be reduced,  and the network retrained. It is also possible to use “pruning” methods to  eliminate neurons or weights in the network.  The number of neurons in the last layer is equal to the number of elements  in the target vector. However, when there are multiple targets, we have a  choice to make. We can have one network with multiple outputs, or we can  have multiple networks, each with one output. For example, neural net- works have been used to estimate LDL, VLDL and HDL cholesterol levels,  based on a spectral analysis of the blood. It is possible to have one neural  network with three neurons in the output layer to estimate all three cho- lesterol levels, or we could have three neural networks, with each one esti- mating only one of the three components. Theoretically, both methods  should work, but in practice one method may work better than another. We  generally start with one multi-output network, and then use multiple sin- gle-output networks if the original results are not satisfactory.  Another architectural choice is the size of the input vector. This is often a  simple choice, which is determined by the training data. However, there  are times when input vectors in the training data have redundant or irrel- evant elements. When the dimension of the potential input vector is very  large, it is sometimes advantageous to eliminate redundant or irrelevant  elements. This can reduce the required computation and can assist in pre-  22-12   Training the Network  Input Selection  Training the Network  venting overfitting during training. The input selection process for nonlin- ear networks can be quite difficult, and there is no perfect solution. The  Bayesian regularization method  Eq.  13.23   can be modified to assist in  input selection. It is possible to have different   parameters for different  sets of weights. For example, we can let each column of the weight matrix  in the first layer of a multilayer network have its own  given element of the input vector is irrelevant, then the corresponding    parameter would become large and force all elements of that column of the  weight matrix to be small. That element could then be eliminated from the  input vector.   parameter. If a        Another technique that can assist in pruning the input vector is a sensitiv- ity analysis of the trained network. In the Sensitivity Analysis section on  page 22-28 we discuss this technique.  After the data has been prepared, and the network architecture has been  selected, we are ready to train the network. In this section, we will discuss  some of the decisions that need to be made as part of the training process.  This includes the method for initializing the weights, the training algo- rithm, the performance index, and the criterion for stopping training.  Weight Initialization Before training the network, we need to initialize the weights and biases.  The method we use will depend on the type of network. For multilayer net- works, the weights and biases are generally set to small random values   e.g., uniformly distributed between -0.5 and 0.5, if the inputs are normal- ized to fall between -1 and 1 . As we discussed in Chapter 12, if we set the  weights and biases to zero, the initial condition may fall on a saddle point  of the performance surface. If we make the initial weights large, the initial  condition can fall on a flat part of the performance surface, caused by sat- uration of the sigmoid transfer functions.  There is another approach to setting the initial weights and biases for a  two-layer network. It was introduced by Widrow and Nguyen [WiNg90].  The idea is to set the magnitude of the weights in the first layer so that the  linear region of each sigmoid function covers   of the range of the input.  The biases are then randomly set, so that the center of each sigmoid func- tion falls randomly in the input space. The details of the method are as fol- lows  assuming the inputs to the network have been normalized to values  between -1 and 1 .

For competitive networks, the weights can also be set as small random  numbers. Another possibility is to randomly select some of the input vec- tors in the training set to become initial rows of the weight matrix. In this  way, we can be sure that the initial weights will fall within the range of the  input vectors, so we will be less likely to have dead units, as described in  Chapter 16. For the SOM, dead units are not a problem. The initial neigh- borhood size is set large enough so that all neurons will have the opportu- nity to learn during the initial stages of training. This will move all weight  vectors into the appropriate region of the input space. Training can con- verge faster, however, if rows of the weight matrix are initially placed in  the active input region.  Choice of Training Algorithm For multilayer networks, we generally use gradient- or Jacobian-based al- gorithms, as described in Chapter 12. These algorithms can be implement- ed in either batch mode or sequential  also known as incremental, pattern  or stochastic  mode. For example, in the sequential form of steepest descent   see Eq.  11.13   we update the weights after each input is presented to the  network. In batch mode  see page 12-7 , all of the inputs are presented to  the network, and the total gradient is computed by summing the gradients  for each input, before the weights are updated. In some situations, the se- quential form is preferred — for example, when on-line or adaptive opera- tion is required. However, many of the more efficient optimization  algorithms  e.g., conjugate gradient and Newton’s methods  are inherently  batch algorithms.   For multilayer networks with up to a few hundred weights and biases that  are being used for function approximation, the Levenberg-Marquardt algo- rithm  see Eq.  12.31   is usually the fastest training method. When the  number of weights reaches a thousand or more, the Levenberg-Marquardt  algorithm is not as efficient as some of the conjugate gradient algorithms.  This is mainly because the matrix inverse calculation scales geometrically  with the number of weights. For large networks, the Scaled Conjugate Gra- dient algorithm of [Moll93] is very efficient. This method is also attractive  for pattern recognition problems. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm  does not work as well for pattern recognition, in which the sigmoid transfer  functions in the final layer are operating well outside the linear region.  Of the algorithms that can be implemented in sequential mode, the fastest  are the extended Kalman filter algorithms. These algorithms are closely re- lated to sequential implementations of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Un- like the batch version of Gauss-Newton, they do not require an inversion of  the approximate Hessian matrix. The decoupled extended Kalman filter  implementation of [PuFe97] appears to be the most efficient of these types  of algorithms.  22-14   Training the Network  Stopping Criteria For most applications of neural networks, the training error never converg- es identically to zero. The error can reach zero for the perceptron network,  assuming a linearly separable problem, as we showed in Chapter 4. How- ever, it is unlikely to happen for multilayer networks. For this reason, we  need to have other criteria for deciding when to stop the training.  We can stop the training when the error reaches some specified limit. How- ever, it is usually difficult to know what an acceptable error level is. The  simplest criterion is to stop the training after a fixed number of iterations.  Because it is also difficult to know how many iterations will be required,  the maximum iteration number is generally set reasonably high. If the  weights have not converged after the maximum number of iterations has  been reached, we can restart training, using the final weights from the first  run as initial conditions for the restart.  We will talk more about how to tell  if a network has converged in the Post-Training Analysis section on page  22-18.   Another stopping criterion is the norm of the gradient of the performance  index. If this norm reaches a sufficiently small threshold, then the training  can be stopped. Since the gradient should be zero at a minimum of the per- formance index, this criterion will stop the algorithm when it gets close to  the minimum. Unfortunately, as we have seen in Chapter 12, the perfor- mance surface for multilayer networks can have many flat regions, where  the norm of the gradient will be small. For this reason, the threshold for  the minimum norm should be set to a very small value  e.g.,  square error performance indices, with normalized targets , so that the  training does not end prematurely.   for mean   10 6–  We can also stop the training when the reduction in the performance index  per iteration becomes small. As with the norm of the gradient, this criterion  can stop the training too early. During the training of multilayer networks,  the performance can remain almost constant for a number of iterations be- fore dropping suddenly. When training is complete, it is useful to view the  training performance curve on a log-log scale, as in Figure 22.5, to verify  convergence.  If we are using early stopping, as discussed in Chapter 13, to prevent over- fitting, then we will stop the training when the performance on the valida- tion set increases for a set number of iterations. In addition to preventing  overfitting, this stopping procedure also provides a significant reduction in  computation; for most practical problems, the validation error will increase  before any of the other stopping criteria are reached.  As shown in Figure 22.1, neural network training is an iterative process.  Even after the training algorithm has converged, post-training analysis  may suggest that the network be modified and retrained. In addition, sev- eral training runs should be made for each potential network to ensure that  a global minimum has been reached.  22-15  22   22 Practical Training Issues     r o r r E   e r a u q S m u S     103  102  101  100  10−1  10−2  10−3    100  101  102  Epochs  103  Figure 22.5  Typical Training Performance Curve  The previous stopping criteria apply mainly to gradient-based training.  When training competitive networks, like the SOFM, there is no explicit  performance index or gradient to monitor for convergence. The training  stops only when the maximum number of iterations has been reached. For  SOFMs, the learning rate and the neighborhood size are decreased over  time. Typically, the neighborhood size is reduced to zero by the completion  of training, so the maximum iteration number determines the end of train- ing, as well as the rate of decrease in neighborhood size and learning rate.  This is therefore a very important parameter. It is generally chosen to be  more than ten times the number of neurons in the network. This is an ap- proximate number, and the network needs to be analyzed at the completion  of training to determine if the performance is satisfactory.  This will be dis- cussed in the Post-Training Analysis section on page 22-18.  The network  may need to be trained several times with different training lengths to  achieve a satisfactory result.  Choice of Performance Function For multilayer networks, the standard performance index is mean square  error. When all inputs in the training set are equally likely to occur, then  this can be written  F x   =    tq  aq–  T tq    aq–    ,   22.4   1 QSM-----------  Q    q  1=  or  22-16   Training the Network  F x   =    ti q  ai q–  2  .  1 QSM-----------  Q    SM   q  1=  i  1=   22.5   The scale factor that occurs outside the sum has no effect on the location of  the optimum weights. Therefore, the sum square error performance index  will produce the same weights as the mean square error performance in- dex. However, the appropriate scaling can be useful when comparing errors  on data sets of different size.  While mean square error is the most common performance index, there are  others that have been used. For example, we could use mean absolute er- ror. This would be similar to Eq.  22.5 , except that the absolute value of  the error would be used, instead of the square of the error. This perfor- mance index is generally less sensitive to one or two large errors in the data  set, and is therefore somewhat more robust to outliers than is the mean  square error algorithm. This concept can be extended to any power of the  absolute error, as follows  F x   =  1 QSM-----------  Q    SM   q  1=  i  1=  ti q  ai q–  K  ,   22.6   K  2=   corresponds to mean square error and   where   corresponds to  mean absolute error. The general error given by Eq.  22.6  is referred to as  the Minkowski error.  1=  K  As we saw in Chapter 13, the mean square performance index can be aug- mented with the mean square weights, to produce a regularized perfor- mance index, which is used to prevent overfitting. The Bayesian  regularization algorithm is an excellent training method for preventing  overfitting. It uses a regularized performance index, and uses Bayesian  methods to select the regularization parameter. See Chapter 13 for details.  Mean square error works well for function approximation problems, in  which the target values are continuous. However, in pattern recognition  problems, where the targets take on discrete values, other performance in- dices might be more appropriate. One performance index that has been  proposed for classification problems is cross-entropy [Bish95]. Cross-entro- py is defined as  F x   –=  Q  SM   q  1=  i  1=  ti q  ln  ai q -------- ti q  .   22.7   Here we assume that the target values are 0 and 1, and they identify which  of the two classes the input vector belongs to. The softmax transfer function   22-17  22  Cross-Entropy   22 Practical Training Issues  is generally used in the last layer of the neural network, if the cross-entro- py performance index is used.  As a closing note on the choice of performance index, recall from Chapter  11 that the backpropagation algorithm for computing training gradients  will work for any differentiable performance index. If you change the per- formance index, you only need to change the initialization of the sensitivi- ties in the last layer  see Eq.  11.37  .  Multiple Training Runs and Committees of Networks A single training run may not produce optimal performance, because of the  possibility of reaching a local minimum of the performance surface. It is  best to restart the training at several different initial conditions and select  the network that produces the best performance. Five to ten restarts will  almost always produce a global optimum [HaBo07].  There is another way to perform multiple training runs and make use of all  of the networks that have been trained. This is called the committee of net- works [PeCo93]. For each training session, the validation set is randomly  selected from the training data, and a random set of initial weights and bi- ases is chosen. After N networks have been trained, all of the networks are  used together to form a joint output. For function approximation networks,  the joint output can be a simple average of the outputs of each network. For  classification networks, the joint output can be the result of a vote, in which  the class that is chosen by the majority of the networks is selected as the  output of the committee. The performance of the committee will usually be  better than even the best of the individual networks. In addition, the vari- ation in the outputs of the individual networks can be used to provide error  bars, or confidence levels, for the committee output.  Post-Training Analysis  Before using a trained neural network, we need to analyze it to determine  if the training was successful. There are many techniques for post-training  analysis. We will discuss some of the more common ones. Since these tech- niques vary, depending on the application, we will organize them according  to these four application areas: fitting, pattern recognition, clustering and  prediction.  Fitting One useful tool for analyzing neural networks trained for fitting problems  is a regression between the trained network outputs and the corresponding  targets. We fit a linear function of the form  aq  =  mtq  + +  c  q  ,   22.8   22-18   Post-Training Analysis  m   and   where  tq aq error of the regression.    is a target value,   c   are the slope and offset, respectively, of the linear function,   is the residual    is a trained network output, and   q  The terms in the regression can be computed as follows:  Q   aq   t– tq   q ----------------------------------------------  a–  1=    ,  mˆ  =  Q    q  1=  t– tq  2  cˆ  =  a mˆ t  –  ,  Q  Q  a  =  1 ---- Q  q  1=  aq  ,   t  =  1 ---- Q  q  1=  tq  .   22.9    22.10    22.11   Outliers  tq=  Figure 22.6 shows an example regression analysis. The blue line represents  the linear regression, the thin black line represents the perfect match  , and the circles represent the data points. In this example, we can  aq see that the match is pretty good, although not perfect. The next step would  be to investigate data points that fall far from the regression line. For ex- ample, there are two points around   that seem to be out- liers. We would investigate these points to see if there was a problem with  the data. This could be a bad data point, or it could be located far from other  training points. In the latter case, we would need to collect more data in  that region.   and   17=  27=  a  t  In addition to computing the regression coefficients, we often also compute  the correlation coefficient between the  , which is also known as  the    value:   and   aq  tq  R  Q   aq   t– tq   q ----------------------------------------------  a–    Q 1–  stsa  1=   ,  R  =   22.12   where  where  st  =  t– tq     and   sa  =    aq a–    .   22.13   1  ------------- Q 1–  Q    q  1=  1  ------------- Q 1–  Q    q  1=  22-19  22   22 Practical Training Issues     a  50  40  30  20  10  0    0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  t  Figure 22.6  Regression Between Trained Network Outputs and Targets  R   value can generally range from -1 to 1, but we would expect it to be  The  close to 1 for our neural network application.

A close  analysis of the scatter plot may be helpful in determining problems in the  fit. For example, we might find that when the targets are large there is  more spread in the scatter plot.  This is not the case in Figure 22.6.  We  might also notice that there are fewer data points with large targets. This  would indicate that we need to have more data points in the training set for  these target values.  Recall that the original data set was divided into training, validation  if  early stopping is used  and testing subsets. The regression analysis should  be performed on each subset individually, as well as the full data set. Dif- ferences between the subsets would indicate overfitting or extrapolation.  For example, if the training set shows accurate fitting, but the validation  and test results are poor, then this would indicate overfitting  which can  sometimes happen, even when early-stopping is used . In this case, we  might reduce the size of the neural network and retrain. If both the train- ing and validation results are good, but the testing results are poor, then   22-20   Post-Training Analysis  this could indicate extrapolation  where the testing data falls outside the  training and validation data . In this case, we need to provide more data  for training and validation. If the results for all three data sets are poor,  then it might be necessary to increase the number of neurons in the net- work. Another choice is to increase the number of layers in the network. If  you start with a single hidden layer, and the results are poor, then a second  hidden layer could be helpful. First, try more neurons in the single hidden  layer, and then increase the number of layers.  In addition to the regression scatter plot, another tool that can identify out- liers is a histogram of the errors, as shown in Figure 22.7. The y-axis rep- resents the number of errors that falls within each interval on the x-axis.  Here we can see that two errors are greater than 8. These represent the  same two errors that we identified as outliers in Figure 22.6.  140  120  100  80  60  40  20  0 −8  Confusion Matrix  −6  −4  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  −2  e  a–=  t  Figure 22.7  Histogram of Network Errors  Pattern Recognition For pattern recognition problems, the regression analysis is not as useful  as it is for fitting problems, since the target values are discrete. However,  there is an analogous tool - the confusion  or misclassification  matrix. The  confusion matrix is a table whose columns represent the target class and  whose rows represent the output class. For example, Figure 22.8 shows a  sample confusion matrix in which there were 214 data points. There were  41 input vectors that belonged to Class 1 and were correctly classified as  Class 1. There were 162 input vectors that belonged to Class 2 and were  correctly classified as Class 2. The correctly classified inputs show in the  diagonal cells of the confusion matrix. The off-diagonal cells show misclas- sified inputs. The lower left cell shows that four inputs from Class 1 were  misclassified by the network as Class 2. If Class 1 is considered a positive  outcome, then the lower left cell represents false negatives, which are also   False Negative  22-21  22   22 Practical Training Issues  False Positive  called Type II errors. The upper right cell shows that one input from Class  2 was misclassified by the network as Class 1. This would be considered a  false positive or a Type I error.  ROC Curve  Figure 22.8  Sample Confusion Matrix  Another useful tool for analyzing a pattern recognition network is called  the Receiver Operating Characteristic  ROC  curve. To create this curve, we  take the output of the trained network and compare it against a threshold  which ranges from -1 to +1  assuming a tansig transfer function in the last  layer . Inputs that produce values above the threshold are considered to be- long to Class 1, and those with values below the threshold are considered  to belong to Class 2. For each threshold value, we count the fraction of true  positives and false positives in the data set. This pair of numbers produces  one point on the ROC curve. As the threshold is varied, we trace the com- plete curve, as shown in Figure 22.9.  The ideal point for the ROC curve to pass through would be  0,1 , which  would correspond to no false positives and all true positives. A poor ROC  curve would represent a random guess, which is represented by the diago- nal line in Figure 22.9, which passes through the point  0.5,0.5 .

There are sev- eral measures of SOM performance. One is quantization error. This is the  average distance between each input vector and the closest prototype vec- tor. It measures the map resolution. This can be made artificially small, if  we use a large number of neurons. If there are as many neurons as input  vectors in the data set, then the quantization error could be zero. This  would represent overfitting. If the number of neurons is not significantly  smaller than the number of input vectors, then the quantization error is  not meaningful.  Another measure of SOM performance is topographic error. This is the pro- portion of all input vectors for which the closest prototype vector and the  next closest prototype vector are not neighbors in the feature map topology.  Topographic error measures the preservation of the topology. In a well- trained SOM, prototypes that are neighbors in the topology should also be  neighbors in the input space. In this case, the topographic error should be  zero.  Distortion Measure  The performance of the SOM can also be assessed by the distortion mea- sure:  Q  S    Ed  =  q  1=  i  1=  hicq wi  pq–  2  ,   22.14   where  that is closest to the input vector    is the neighborhood function, and   hij  :  cq  pq   is the index of the prototype   22  22-23   22 Practical Training Issues  cq  =  arg  minj wj    pq–    .   22.15   For the simplest neighborhood function,  within some pre-specified neighborhood radius of prototype j, and equal to  zero otherwise.

Prediction As we discussed earlier, one application of neural networks is the predic- tion of the future values of some time series. For prediction problems, we  use dynamic networks, such as the focused time-delay neural network  shown in Figure 22.3. There are two important concepts that are used  when analyzing a trained prediction network:  the prediction errors should not be correlated in time, and  the prediction errors should not be correlated with the input sequence.  If the prediction errors were correlated in time, then we would be able to  predict the prediction errors and, therefore, improve our original predic- tion. Also, if the prediction errors were correlated with the input sequence,  then we would also be able to use this correlation to predict the errors.   1.  2.  Autocorrelation Function  In order to test the correlation of the prediction errors in time, we can use  the sample autocorrelation function:  Re    =  e t e t  +    .   22.17   1  ------------ Q –  Q –    t  1=  White Noise  Re    If the prediction errors are uncorrelated  white noise , then we would ex- pect   is  close to zero, we can set an approximate 95% confidence interval [BoJe96]  using the range   to be close to zero, except when   .

The training set is used to calculate gradi- ents and to determine weight updates. The validation set is used to stop  training before overfitting occurs.  If Bayesian regularization is used, then  the validation set may be merged with the training set.  The test set is used  to predict future performance of the network. The test set performance is  the measure of network quality. If, after a network has been trained, the  test set performance is not adequate, then there are usually four possible  causes:     the network has reached a local minimum,    the network does not have enough neurons to fit the data,    the network is overfitting, or    the network is extrapolating.  The local minimum problem can almost always be overcome by retraining  the network with five to ten random sets of initial weights. The network  with minimum training error will generally represent a global minimum.  The other three problems can generally be distinguished by analyzing the  training, validation and test set errors. For example, if the validation error  is much larger than the training error, then overfitting has probably oc- curred. Even though early stopping is used, it is possible to have some over- fitting, if the training occurs too quickly. In this case, we can use a slower  training algorithm to retrain the network.  22-27  22   22 Practical Training Issues  If the validation, training and test errors are all similar in size, but the er- rors are too large, then it is likely that the network is not powerful enough  to fit the data. In this case, we should increase the number of neurons in  the hidden layer and retrain the network. If Bayesian regularization is  used, this situation is indicated by the effective number of parameters be- coming equal to the total number of parameters. When the network is large  enough, the effective number of parameters should remain below the total  number of parameters.  If the validation and training errors are similar in size, but the test errors  are significantly larger, then the network may be extrapolating. This indi- cates that the test data fall outside the range of the training and validation  data. In this case, we need to get more data. You can merge the test data  into the training validation data and then collect new test data. You should  continue to add data until the results on all three data sets are similar.  If training, validation and test errors are similar, and the errors are small  enough, then we can put the multilayer network to use. However, we still  need to be careful about the possibility of extrapolation. If the multilayer  network inputs are outside the range of the data with which it was trained,  then extrapolation will occur. It is difficult to guarantee that training data  will encompass all future uses of a neural network.   One method for detecting extrapolation is to train a companion competitive  network to cluster the input vectors in the multilayer network training set.  Then, when an input is applied to the multilayer network, the same input  is applied to the companion competitive network. When the distance of the  input vector to the nearest prototype vector of the competitive network is  larger than the distance from the prototype to the most distant member of  its cluster of inputs in the training set, we can suspect extrapolation. This  technique is referred to as novelty detection.  Sensitivity Analysis After a multilayer network has been trained, it is often useful to assess the  importance of each element of the input vector. If we can determine that a  given element of the input vector is unimportant, then we can eliminate it.  This can simplify the network, reduce the amount of computation and help  prevent overfitting. There is no one method that can absolutely determine  the importance of each input, but a sensitivity analysis can be helpful in  this regard. A sensitivity analysis computes the derivatives of the network  response with respect to each element of the input vector. If the derivative  with respect to a certain input element is small, then that element can be  eliminated from the input vector.  Because the multilayer network is nonlinear, the derivative of the network  output with respect to an input element will not be constant. For each input  vector in the training set, the derivatives will be different. For this reason,  we can’t use a single derivative to determine sensitivity. One option would   22-28  Novelty Detection   Post-Training Analysis  be to take the average of the absolute derivatives, or else the rms deriva- tives, over the entire training set. Another option would be to compute the  derivative of the sum square error with respect to each element of the input  vector. Each of these will compute a single derivative for each element of  the input vector.

To get the derivative  of the sum square error, we sum the individual derivatives for each single  squared error. The resulting vector will contain the derivatives of the sum  square error for each element of the input vector. If we find that some of  these derivatives are much smaller than the maximum derivative, then we  can consider removing those inputs. After removing the potentially irrele- vant inputs, we retrain the network and compare the performance with the  original network. If the performance is similar, then we accept the simpli- fied network.  22-29  22   22 Practical Training Issues  Epilogue  While previous chapters have focused on the fundamentals of particular  network architectures and training rules, this chapter has discussed some  practical aspects of neural network training. Neural network training is an  iterative process involving data collection and preprocessing, network ar- chitecture selection, network training and post-training analysis.  The next five chapters will demonstrate some of these practical aspects, as  we present some real-world case studies. The case studies will cover a va- riety of applications, including function fitting, density estimation, pattern  recognition, clustering and prediction.  22-30   Further Reading  Further Reading  [Bish95]   [BoJe94]   [HaBo07]  [HeOh97]  C.M.

Neural networks can be used for a wide variety of applications, and  it would be impossible to provide case studies for each application. We will  limit our presentations to five important application areas: function ap- proximation  aka, nonlinear regression , density function estimation, pat- tern recognition  aka, pattern classification , clustering and prediction   aka, time series analysis, system identification, or dynamic modeling . For  each case study, we will step through the neural network design training  process.  In this chapter, we present a function approximation problem. For function  approximation problems, the training set consists of a set of dependent  variables  response variables  and one or more independent variables  ex- planatory variables . The neural network learns to create a mapping be- tween the explanatory variables and the response variables. In the case  study we consider in this chapter, the system in question is a smart sensor.  A smart sensor consists of one or more standard sensors that are coupled  with a neural network to produce a calibrated measurement of a single pa- rameter. In this chapter, we will consider a smart position sensor, which  uses the voltages coming from two solar cells to produce an estimate of the  location of an object in one dimension.  23-1   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  Theory and Examples  This chapter presents a case study in using neural networks for function  approximation. Function approximation consists of defining a mapping be- tween a set of input variables and a corresponding set of output variables.  For example, we might want to estimate the price of a home, based on char- acteristics of the neighborhood, such as tax rate, pupil teacher ratio in local  schools and crime rate. Another example would be estimating octane num- ber of a gasoline product at an oil refinery, based on measurements of re- actor temperatures and pressures [FoGi07]. In the case study presented in  this chapter, we will consider a smart position sensor system.  Description of the Smart Sensor System  Figure 23.1 illustrates the sensor arrangements for this case study. An ob- ject is suspended between a light source and two solar cells. The object  casts a shadow on the solar cells, which causes the voltage out of the solar  cells to decrease.   Shadow  v1  v2  Figure 23.1  Position Sensor Arrangement  y  v2   decreases, then    increases, first the voltage  v1  increases, and finally  v2  As the object position  voltage  demonstrated in Figure 23.2. Our objective is to determine the object posi- tion from measurements of the two voltages. Clearly this is a very nonlin- ear relationship, so a multilayer network will be needed to learn the  mapping. This is a classic type of function approximation problem, in which  we are trying to learn the inverse of a function. The forward function is the    decreases, then the   increases.

The ob- ject we used for these experiments was a table tennis ball. The data is dis- played in Figure 23.3. There are a total of 67 sets of measurements. Each  circle represents a voltage measurement at a calibrated position. The units  of position are inches, and the units of voltage are volts. The flat regions at  0 volts for each curve occur where the shadow of the ball completely covers  a sensor. If the shadow were large enough to cover both cells at the same  time, we would not be able to recover ball position from cell voltages.  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0 0  v2  v1  23-3  1  2  3  y  Figure 23.3  Data Collected from Solar Cells   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  The next step is to divide the data into training, validation and test sets. In  this case, because we will be using the Bayesian regularization training  technique, we do not need to have a validation set. We did set aside 15% of  the data for testing purposes. To perform the division, we arranged the  data in order, according to object position, and then selected every sixth or  seventh point for testing. This resulted in 10 testing points. The testing  points are not used in any way for training the network, but after the net- work has been completely trained, we will use the testing data as an indi- cator of future network performance.  The input vector for network training will consist of the solar cell voltages  and the target will be ball position  p  =  ,  v1 v2  t  y=  .   23.1    23.2   The data were scaled using Eq.  22.1 , so that both the inputs and the tar- gets were in the range [-1,1].

We know that there will be two elements in the input vector,    23  Training the Network  which is defined in Eq.  23.1 . The single target for the network is the ball  position, given in Eq.  23.2 .   Figure 23.5 shows the network architecture. We are using the tan-sigmoid  transfer function in the hidden layer, and a linear output layer. This is the  standard network for function approximation. As we discussed in Chapter  11, this network has been shown to be a universal approximator. There are  cases in which two hidden layers are used, but we normally try first with  one hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer,  , will de- pend on the function to be approximated. This is something that cannot  generally be known before training. We will have more to say about this in  the next section.

Then we used  Bayesian regularization to train the network. Bayesian regularization,  which we discussed in Chapter 13, is a very effective algorithm for training  multilayer networks to perform function approximation. This algorithm is  designed to train networks so that they generalize well, without the need  for a validation set. Because the validation set can then be added to the  training set, the performance is often better than that obtained with early  stopping.  In the next chapter, we will give an example of using early stop- ping, with a validation set.    Figure 23.6 illustrates the sum square error versus iteration number,  while using the Bayesian regularization training algorithm. We used a net- work with 10 neurons in the hidden layer     for this case. The net- work was trained for 100 iterations, at which time the performance was  changing very little.  10=  S1  23-5   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  E S S  102  101  100  10−1  10−2  10−3  100  23-6  101  Iterations  102  Figure 23.6  Sum Squared Error vs. Iteration Number    S1  10=     Training has converged after 100 iterations, but we want to ensure that we  have not fallen into a local minimum. For this reason, we want to retrain  the network several times, using different initial weights and biases.  We  use the Nguyen-Widrow initialization method described in Chapter 22.   Table 23.1. shows the final validation SSE for each of five different training  runs. We can see that all of the errors are similar, although the errors are  slightly smaller for runs 2, 4 and 5. Any of the weights from these five cases  would produce a satisfactory network. We will discuss this in more detail  in the next section.  1.121e-003  8.313e-004  1.068e-003  8.672e-004  8.271e-004  Table 23.1.  Final Training SSE for Five Different Initial Conditions      Recall from Chapter 13 that the Bayesian regularization algorithm com- putes a parameter  , which indicates the effective number of parameters  that are being used by the network. In Figure 23.7, we can see the variation  of   during training. It eventually converges to 17.4. There are a total of 41  parameters in this 2-10-1 network, so we are only using about 40% of the  weights and biases. For each of the five training runs discussed above,     converged to values between 17 and 20. This indicates that we might be  able to use a smaller network, if we are concerned about the amount of com- putation required to compute a network response.   23  Validation    20  15  10  5  0 0  20  40  60  80  100  Iterations  Figure 23.7  Effective Number of Parameters    S1  10=     To see whether or not a smaller network would be satisfactory, we trained  several networks with different numbers of hidden neurons. Since the ef- fective number of parameters is near 20, we would expect that a network  with five hidden neurons  21 weights and biases  might provide an ade- quate fit. Our experiments produced the results shown in Table 23.2. We  can see that the performances of all five networks are roughly equivalent,  except for the case where  , where the total number of parameters in  the network is only 13.   3=  S1  S1  3=  S1  5=  S1  8=  S1     10=     S1  20=  4.406e-003  9.227e-004  8.088e-004  8.672e-004  8.096e-004  Table 23.2.  Final Training SSE for Five Different Hidden Layer Sizes  The Bayesian regularization method allows us to train a network of almost  arbitrary size, and yet insure that only the required number of parameters  is effectively used. If we were concerned about the amount of time required  to compute the network output  e.g., for real-time applications , then we  would want to use the network with  . Otherwise, the original net- work with   is satisfactory. We don’t need to spend a lot of time find- ing the optimal number of neurons. The training algorithm will insure that  we do not overfit.  10=  5=  S1  S1  Validation  An important tool for network validation is a scatter plot of network out- puts versus targets, as shown in Figure 23.8  in normalized units . We ex-  23-7   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  pect that for a well trained network the points in the scatter plot will fall  close to the 45  output=target line. In this case, the fit is excellent. The fig- ure on the left shows the training data, while the figure on the right shows  the testing data. Because the testing data fit is as good as the training data  fit, we can be confident that the network did not overfit.

This gives us an idea of the accuracy of the network. For this histo- gram, we have converted the network output back into units of inches. This  is done by applying the reverse of the target preprocessing function to the  network output. The reverse of Eq.  22.1 , for the targets, is given by  a  =  an    1+  .*  tmax tmin   -----------------------------  tmin  +  – 2   23.3   an  .*   represents an element-by-element multiplica-   is the original network output, which was trained to match the   where  normalized target, and  tion of two vectors. After the postprocessing operation of Eq.  23.3 , the re- sulting un-normalized output is subtracted from the raw targets, to  produce an error in inches. Figure 23.9 shows the distribution of these er- rors for both training and testing sets. We can see that almost all errors are  within one hundredth of an inch. This is within the accuracy of the original  measurements, so we cannot expect to do better.  23-8   Validation  23  15  10  5  y  2.5  3  2  1  1.5  0.5  0 0  0  −0.02  −0.01  0  0.01  0.02  Figure 23.9  Histogram of Position Errors  in Inches   Because this network has only two inputs, we can plot the trained network  response, which is shown in Figure 23.10.

The blue circles indicate the path that is taken by the voltages as the  ball is moved. Notice that the Bayesian regularization training has pro- duced a smooth network response, even though the response is highly non- linear.   2  v2  4  0  2  6  4  v1  Figure 23.10  Network Response  Original Units   Another thing to notice about Figure 23.10 is that training data only falls  along the blue circles. The form of the network response in other regions is  of no importance for the operation of the smart sensor system, since the   23-9   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  network will never be used there. If the network were retrained, the shape  of the response away from the blue circles might be very different, even  though the response near the blue circles will always be the same. This con- cept is very important for many neural network applications. Often, during  normal network operation, only a small portion of the input space will be  accessed. The network only has to fit the underlying function in these re- gions where the network will be used. This means that the size of the data  set can be modest, even when the input dimension is large. Of course, in  these cases, it is critical that the training data span the full range of poten- tial network operation.  Data Sets  There are two data files associated with this case study:    ball_p.txt — contains the input vectors in the original data set    ball_t.txt — contains the target vectors in the original data set  They can be found with the demonstration software, which is described in  Appendix C.  23-10   Epilogue  Epilogue  23  This chapter has demonstrated the use of multilayer neural networks for  function approximation. This case study is representative of a large class  of neural network applications that could be termed “soft sensors” or  “smart sensors.” The idea is to use a neural network to fuse several raw  sensor outputs into a calibrated measurement of some key variable of in- terest.  A multilayer network with sigmoid transfer functions in the hidden layers  and linear transfer functions in the output layer is well suited to this type  of application, and Bayesian regularization is an excellent training algo- rithm to use in this situation.  In the next chapter, we will look at another neural network application —  probability estimation. We will also use multilayer neural networks for  that application, but we will change the transfer function in the output lay- er.  23-11   23 Case Study 1: Function Approximation  Further Reading  [FoGi07]  L.

The previous chapter demonstrated the use of neural networks  for function approximation. In this chapter we use a neural network to es- timate a probability function.   Probability estimation is a special case of function approximation. In func- tion approximation we want the neural network to map between a set of in- put variables and a set of response variables. However, in the case of  probability estimation the response variables correspond to a set of proba- bilities. Since probabilities have certain special properties — they must al- ways be positive, and they must sum to 1 — we want the neural network  to enforce these conditions.   In the case study we consider in this chapter, the system in question is  chemical vapor deposition of diamond. A carbon dimer  a bound pair of car- bon atoms  is projected toward a diamond surface. We want to determine  the probabilities for various reactions based on characteristics of the pro- jected dimer. The input variables consist of such properties as translational  energy and incidence angle, and the response variables consist of the prob- abilities of the potential reactions, such as chemisorption and scattering.  24-1   24 Case Study 2: Probability Estimation  Theory and Examples  CVD  This chapter presents a case study in using neural networks for probability  estimation. Probability estimation consists of determining the probabilities  of certain events, based on a set of input variables. For example, we might  want to know the probabilities associated with a patient having a certain  disease, based on a set of laboratory tests. Another example would be de- termining the probability of a financial instrument going up in price, based  on a set of market conditions.  For this probability estimation case study, we will train a neural network  to estimate reaction rates in a chemical process. Chemical vapor deposition   CVD  of diamond is a process for making synthetic diamond. The idea is to  cause carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. In  order to study this process, scientists are often interested in reaction rates,  which will determine how quickly the diamond can be created. In this case  study, we will train a neural network to compute reaction rates as a carbon  dimer  a bound pair of carbon atoms  interacts with the crystalline dia- mond substrate.  We will begin by describing the CVD process and how simulated data can  be collected for this process. Then, we will show how a neural network can  be trained to learn the reaction probabilities. The details of the procedure  are described in [AgSa05].  Description of the CVD Process  During the CVD process, a carbon dimer is projected toward a diamond  substrate. For the purpose of this study, we will assume that the dimer can  react with the substrate in one of three ways: chemisorption  the atoms in  the dimer become bound to the substrate , scattering  the atoms bounce off  the substrate , or desorption  the atoms become bound to the substrate for  a period of time, but are then released . There is another possible reaction  that occurs with very small probability, but we will ignore it for this study.   See [AgSa05] for a full discussion.  We will train a neural network to esti- mate the probabilities of each of the reactions, based on various character- istics of the carbon dimer, which will be described below.  The notation we will use to define this interaction is illustrated in Figure  24.1. The black circle represents the carbon dimer, and the corresponding  directed line represents the direction of the initial velocity vector. The blue  star represents the location of the central carbon atom in the diamond sub- strate. The angle   denotes the angle of incidence, i.e., the angle between  the direction of the initial velocity vector of the carbon dimer and the per- pendicular on the surface  the z direction . The impact parameter b is de- fined as the distance between the location of the central atom and the point  of intersection of the initial velocity vector and the diamond surface  indi-    24-2   Data Collection and Preprocessing  cated by the origin of the axes in Figure 24.1 . The angle   represents the  angle between the x axis and the line from the origin to the central atom.    z   cid:4   b   cid:3   24  y  Figure 24.1  Notation for Carbon Dimer Diamond Substrate Interaction  Data Collection and Preprocessing  Data for training the neural network are obtained by molecular dynamics   MD  simulations. In MD, the motion of atoms and molecules in a material  under a given force are simulated, using known laws of physics to calculate  the forces on individual atoms [RaMa05]. For this case study, we use a total  of 324 atoms to model the CVD system. Out of these, 282 atoms of diamond  substrate are used to model the crystalline face with 40 atoms of hydrogen  on the top layer of the diamond surface, and 2 atoms in the C2 dimer. In  Figure 24.1, the  x,y  plane represents the location of the diamond sub- strate. Each of the carbon atoms on the top layer of the substrate, except  the central atom and boundary atoms, is capped by a hydrogen atom. Any  reactions will occur near the central atom.  For this study, we want to determine the dependence of probabilities for  chemisorption, scattering, and desorption on b,  , rotational velocity      of the C2 dimer.

As a  note of clarification here, we use the term Monte Carlo to refer to the set of  simulations that are obtained by setting a number of the variables to ran- dom values for each trajectory.

To train a neural network, we need a set of target outputs.

Be- fore presenting the input data to the network for training, they are scaled  using Eq.  22.1 , so that each element of the input vector ranges from -1 to  1. The targets have values that are always in the range 0 to 1, since they  represent probabilities. In the next section, we will describe a network ar- chitecture, in which the softmax transfer function of Eq.  22.3  is used in  the final layer. This transfer function produces outputs that range from 0  to 1, so the original unscaled targets will work fine.  vrot  Selecting the Architecture  We will use a multilayer network for this application. We know that there  will be five elements in the input vector, which is defined in Eq.  24.1 .

Therefore, they are always in the range 0 to 1, and they always sum to 1.   24-5   24 Case Study 2: Probability Estimation  This is an ideal situation for using the softmax transfer function of Eq.   22.3 , which is repeated here:  ai  =  f ni    =  exp  ni    exp  nj    .   24.4   S    j  1=  ai   is affected by all of the net inputs   This transfer function is different from others we have used, in that each  neuron output  .

The input vec- tor of Eq.  24.1  has 5 elements. The output vector has 3 elements, which is  consistent with the target vector of Eq.  24.3 . The transfer function in the  hidden layer is the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid, and the softmax transfer  function is used in the output layer. The number of neurons in the hidden  , is yet to be determined. It depends on the complexity of the func- layer,  tion that we are trying to approximate, but we do not know at this point  how complex the function is. In general, the size of the hidden layer must  be determined as part of the training process. We must choose   so that  the network provides an accurate fit to the training data, without overfit- ting. We will discuss this selection in the next section.

Many other conjugate gradient or Levenberg-Marquardt algo- rithms, such as those discussed in Chapter 12, would have also worked  well. The targets for this problem have a significant amount of noise, so we  are not expecting extreme accuracy in the final fit. We used early stopping,  as described in Chapter 13, to prevent overfitting. We stopped the training  if the error on the validation set failed to improve over 25 iterations. A typ- ical training session is illustrated in Figure 24.3, which shows training and  validation MSE. The minimum of the validation performance was reached  at iteration 69. The algorithm continued for 25 more iterations, until iter- ation 94. Since the validation error was not reduced during those 25 itera- tions, the weights from iteration 69 were saved as the final trained values.

We need to verify that this is a reasonable num- ber. One indicator is a comparison of training and validation performance.  Table 24.1. shows the training and validation root mean square error   RMSE  for the trained network. We can see that training and validation  errors are roughly the same. The validation data was randomly selected  and was selected independently of the training set. Because the errors were  approximately the same on both sets, it appears that the network fit is con- sistent throughout the relevant input range, and no overfitting occurs.

We will have more to say about that in the next sec- tion, but at this point we can try fitting networks with different numbers  of hidden neurons. Table 24.2. shows the results of fitting a network with  two hidden neurons. Again, the training and validation errors are consis- tent, which indicates lack of overfitting, but the errors are higher than  those for   10=  S1  .

Comparison of Training and Validation RMSE for   S1  20=  There is one further step that we want to make as part of the training pro- cess. We want to ensure that we have not fallen into a local minimum. For  this reason, we want to retrain the network several times, using different  initial weights and biases.  We use the Nguyen-Widrow initialization  method described in Chapter 22.  Table 24.4. shows the final validation  MSE for each of five different training runs. We can see that all of the er- rors are similar, so we have reached a global minimum at each run. If one  error was significantly lower than the others, then we would use the  weights that obtained the lowest error.  3.074e-003  2.953e-003  3.031e-003  3.105e-003  3.050e-003  Table 24.4.  Final Validation MSE for Five Different Initial Conditions  We have determined that a neural network with ten neurons in the hidden  layer produces a reasonable response without overfitting. The next step is  to analyze the performance of the network. Depending on the results of  that analysis, we might adjust the network architecture or training data  and retrain the network.  Validation  An important tool for network validation is a scatter plot of network out- puts versus targets, as shown in Figure 24.4. Here we can see that there is  a strong linear relationship between the targets and the network outputs,  but there appears to be quite a bit of variation. We might expect that for a  well trained network the points in the scatter plot would fall exactly on the  outputs=target line. Why do we have so much variation in this plot? The  reason is that the targets of the network are not the true reaction probabil- ities,  . There is noise in the  targets.   , but the Monte Carlo estimates   MC p PX  PX p      24-9   24 Case Study 2: Probability Estimation  NN PS  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0 0  NN PD  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0 0  NN PC  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0 0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1  MC PC  MC  PS  MC PD  Figure 24.4  Scatter Plot of Network Outputs vs. Targets    NT  50=     The relationship between  pect to have  MC  PX   and   PX   is such that ~95% of the time we ex-  where  PX  2–    MC PX PX    2+  ,    =  PX 1 PX–  ----------------------------  .

In Figure 24.7, we see the effect of the impact parameter b on the reaction  probabilities, as determined by the neural network. As the impact param- eter is increased, the probability of chemisorption decreases, while the  probabilities of scattering and desorption increase.

Therefore, we can perform arbitrary studies by simply computing  the network responses at a varying set of input points. Note that the net- work interpolated smoothly through a noisy set of data points to capture  the true underlying function. By using the early stopping technique, we  prevented the network from overfitting the noise in the data.  p  24-11   24 Case Study 2: Probability Estimation  1  0.5  NN PC  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  NN PS  0.5  NN PD  0.5  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5  0.5  1.5  2.5  3.5  1  1  1  2  2  2  3  3  3  0.5  2.5  3.5  1.5  b  Figure 24.7  Reaction Probabilities vs. Impact Parameter  Data Sets  There are four data files associated with this case study:    cvd_p.txt — contains the input vectors in the original data set    cvd_t.txt — contains the target vectors in the original data set    cvd_p500.txt — contains the input vectors in the   =  500   test set    cvd_t500.txt — contains the target vectors in the   =  500   test set  NT NT  They can be found with the demonstration software, which is described in  Appendix C.  24-12   Epilogue  Epilogue  This chapter has illustrated the use of neural networks for probability es- timation on a chemical vapor deposition problem. Monte Carlo simulations  were used to provide estimates of the reaction probabilities. These esti- mates were used as targets for the neural network. The network was able  to capture the true underlying probability function without overfitting to  the errors in the Monte Carlo estimates. This was accomplished by using  the early stopping procedure, which stops network training if the error on  an independent validation set increases.  In the next chapter, we apply neural networks to a pattern recognition  problem. We will also use multilayer neural networks for that application.  24  24-13   24 Case Study 2: Probability Estimation  Further Reading  [AgSa05]  P.M. Agrawal, A.N.A. Samadh, L.M. Raff, M. Hagan, S.

In pattern recognition problems, you want a neural network to  classify inputs into a set of target categories, e.g., recognize the vineyard  that a particular bottle of wine came from, based on a chemical analysis, or  classify a tumor as benign or malignant, based on uniformity of cell size,  clump thickness, mitosis.  In this chapter we will demonstrate the application of multilayer neural  networks to the recognition of heart disease from a reading of the electro- cardiogram. We will show each of the steps in the pattern recognition pro- cess: data collection, feature extraction, architecture selection, network  training and network validation.  25-1   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition  Theory and Examples  In pattern recognition  pattern classification  problems we are trying to  categorize network inputs into their corresponding classes. Here are a few  examples of pattern recognition problems:    recognition of handwritten zip codes    spoken word recognition    disease recognition from a list of symptoms    fingerprint recognition    white blood cell classification  In the case study presented in this chapter, we will be looking for patterns  in electrocardiogram signals that indicate the presence of a myocardial in- farction  heart attack .   Description of Myocardial Infarction Recognition  An electrocardiogram  EKG  is a recording of the electrical activity of the  heart over time. It generally consists of an array of different signals record- ed at the same time. An EKG can consist of a single signal  also called a  lead , although the standard EKG that is used for detailed interpretation  consists of 12 leads. EKG’s with as many as 15 leads are sometimes used.  Each lead represents the electrical activity across two points on the body.  The 12-lead EKG is determined from 10 electrodes that are placed on spe- cific locations on the body. The calculation of the 12-lead potentials from  the 10 electrodes is a somewhat complex calculation, and beyond the scope  of this case study. The interested reader is referred to [Dubi00] for a more  complete discussion of the EKG.  Through a careful analysis of the EKG, a physician can often determine the  health of the heart. The shapes of the signals indicate the path of electrical  flow in the heart as various muscles are contracted in a coordinated way to  pump blood in and out. If a part of the heart muscle has been damaged be- cause of a lack of blood flow through the coronary arteries  called a myocar- dial infarction  MI , or heart attack , then the path of electrical flow  changes. A well-trained physician can discern from the changes in the  EKG, if the heart has been damaged, and where the damage has occurred.  For this case study, we will train a neural network to recognize MI’s, using  information obtained from a 15 lead EKG.  25-2   Data Collection and Preprocessing  Data Collection and Preprocessing  The EKG signals used for this case study were obtained from the Physio- Net database [MoMa01]. Data were extracted from the QT data set for  healthy patients and patients with MI’s. Each EKG consists of 15 leads.  The leads are labeled I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, VX,  VY, VZ. Figure 25.1 shows a small portion of the lead I signal for one of the  healthy patients.  25  0.6  0.4  0.2  0  −0.2  0  0.5  1  Time  sec   1.5  2  Figure 25.1  Example EKG Signal  Our data set has a total of 447 EKG records. Of these, 79 represent healthy  patients, and the remaining 368 have an MI diagnosis. A diagnosis for each  record was provided by a physician, but it is possible for the diagnosis to be  in error. We will have more to say about this when we come to the valida- tion of the network.  Each EKG consists of 15 leads measured at a rate of 1000 Hz for a period  of several minutes. This is an enormous amount of data, and it would be  impractical to use the entire EKG as an input to the neural network. As  with many pattern recognition problems, we need to perform a feature ex- traction step before using the neural network to execute the pattern recog- nition step. Feature extraction involves mapping the high-dimensional  input space into a space with fewer dimensions, in order to simplify and  make more robust the pattern recognition step.  There are a number of general methods for dimensionality reduction. This  includes linear methods, like the principal components method that we  mentioned in Chapter 22, and nonlinear methods, like manifold learning  [TeSi00]. For this case study, instead of using general methods to generate  the low-dimensional feature space, we will extract features that are com-  25-3   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition  monly used by physicians to detect abnormalities in the EKG. The first step  is to consider a typical cycle of an EKG signal, as shown in Figure 25.2.  PR  Segment  R  ST  Segment  P  T  PR  Interval  Q  S  QRS  Duration  QT Interval  Figure 25.2  Prototype Cycle of an Electrocardiogram Signal  William Einthoven, in the early 1900’s, was the first to carefully measure  and analyze the EKG. He assigned the letters P, Q, R, S and T to the vari- ous deflections shown in the prototype cycle of Figure 25.2. He also de- scribed the electrocardiographic features of a number of cardiovascular  disorders. He won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1924 for his discoveries.  His features are still used to this day.  For this study, we have used some of the features that are in standard use  by physicians, as well as other features that are related to the prototype cy- cle [Raff06]. The descriptions of the 47 features that we used are listed be- low.  If a description refers to the “amplitude” lead, this refers to the square  root of the sum of squares of the VX, VY and VZ leads.

Each record has 47 input  variables, and one target value. The target is 1 for a healthy diagnosis and  -1 for an MI diagnosis.  One of the problems with the data set is that there are only 79 records for  the healthy diagnosis, while there are 368 records for the MI diagnosis. If  we train the network using the sum square error performance index, where  all of the errors are weighted equally, the network will be biased to indicate   25-5   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition  the MI diagnosis. The ideal solution to this problem would be to collect  more data from healthy patients. Let’s say that this is not possible in this  case, and we need to do what we can with the data available. One possibil- ity is to use a weighted sum square error as the performance index, where  errors for healthy patients would be weighted higher than errors for MI pa- tients, so that overall healthy and MI contributions would be equal if each  error were equal. Another simple approach is to repeat the healthy records  in the data set, so that the total number of healthy records is equal to the  number of MI records. This requires extra computation, but that is not a  problem in this case study. Since it is the simplest solution, we will use it  here.  After the data has been collected, the next step is to divide the data into  training, validation and test sets. In this case, we randomly set aside 15%  of the data for validation and 15% for testing. For the validation and test- ing sets, we did not include multiple entries of the healthy records. This  was done only for the training set.  The data were normalized using Eq.  22.1 , so that the inputs were in the  range [-1,1]. Since the tangent-sigmoid transfer function will be used in the  output layer of the neural network, the targets were set to values of -0.76  and +0.76, instead of -1 and 1, to prevent training difficulties caused by sat- uration of the sigmoid functions, as discussed in Chapter 22.  Selecting the Architecture  Figure 25.3 shows the network architecture. We are using the tangent-sig- moid transfer function in both layers. This is the standard network for pat- tern recognition. There are cases in which two hidden layers are used, but  we normally try first with one hidden layer. The number of neurons in the  hidden layer,  , will depend on the complexity of the decision boundaries  needed for the pattern recognition task. This is something that cannot gen- erally be known before training. We will start with 10 neurons in the hid- den layer, and then test the network performance after training.

This algorithm is very efficient for pattern recognition problems.  We used early stopping to prevent network overfitting.  10=  Figure 25.4 illustrates the mean squared error versus iteration number.  The blue line shows the validation error, and the black line shows the train- ing error. We used a network with 10 neurons in the hidden layer  S1    . The minimum validation error occurred at iteration 16, as indi- cated by the circle in Figure 25.4, and the network parameters were saved  at this point. Note that the validation error curve does not always fall at  each iteration, and it may rise before falling to a lower value. We tested  that the validation error was not reduced over 40 iterations before we final- ly stopped the training.  25  101  100  10−1  E S M     Validation  Training  10−2   0  10  20 30 Iterations  40  50  Figure 25.4  Mean Squared Error vs. Iteration Number    S1  10=     Validation  As we discussed in previous chapters, an important tool for network vali- dation in function approximation problems is a scatter plot of network out- puts versus targets. For pattern recognition problems, the network outputs  and targets are discrete variables, so a scatter plot is not particularly use- ful. Instead of the scatter plot, we use the confusion matrix, which was dis- cussed in Chapter 22. Figure 25.5 shows the confusion matrix for our  trained network on the test data. The upper left cell shows that 13 of the  14 healthy EKG’s in the test set were classified correctly, while the 2,2 cell  shows that 66 of the 71 MI EKG’s were classified correctly. A total of 92.9%  of the test data were classified correctly. The largest number of mistakes  were for MI records that were classified as healthy  5 , as shown in cell 1,2.  25-7   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition   Confusion Matrix  13  15.3%  5  5.9%  72.2% 27.8%  1  1.2%  66  77.6%  98.5% 1.5%  1  2  s s a l C    t u p t u O  92.9% 7.1%  1  93.0% 7.0%  92.9% 7.1%  2  Target Class  Figure 25.5  Confusion Matrix for Test Data  One Data Division   Another useful validation tool for pattern recognition problems is the Re- ceive Operating Characteristic  ROC  curve, described in Chapter 22.

Because the data set is fairly  small, especially in terms of healthy diagnoses, we might wonder how sen- sitive the results are to the data division. To investigate this sensitivity, we  performed a Monte Carlo simulation. The data were divided 1,000 different    Validation  times. For each division of the data, a neural network was trained with dif- ferent random initial weights. The results of the 1,000 trials were averaged  together, and the results are shown in Figure 25.7.

There were approximately 12 healthy patients   on average  in each test set. Of these, more than 9 were correctly diag- nosed. There were approximately 54 sick patients in each test set, and ap- proximately 50 were correctly diagnosed. The average testing error was  approximately 9.5%. Note that none of the patients in the test set were  used to train the neural network, so these numbers should be conservative  estimates of how the network should perform on new patients.  The average test results for the Monte Carlo simulation are similar to our  original test results. However, in addition to knowing the average results,  it is also helpful to look at the distribution of errors. Figure 25.8 shows a  histogram of the percentage errors. The average percent error is 9.5%, but  there is a significant spread in the distribution of errors. The standard de- viation of the percent error is 3.5.  25-9   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition  160  120  80  40  0  0  5  10  15  20  25  Percent Error  Figure 25.8  Percent Error Histogram  1000 Monte Carlo Trials   This Monte Carlo process can be helpful in validating the data and the  training process. For example, it is possible to identify which patients are  misclassified in each Monte Carlo run. Those patients who are consistently  misclassified  regardless of the division of the data  can be carefully inves- tigated. These cases can be helpful in two areas. First, they can enable us  to refine the data base. If, after reevaluation by clinicians, it is determined  that a particular patient was mislabeled in the original data set, the data  can be corrected. Second, if we find upon review that the patient was cor- rectly labeled in the original data set, then we can use that patient to help  improve the operation of the neural network classification. This may in- volve identifying new features which capture the key characteristics of the  EKG, or it may involve obtaining more data with similar characteristics, in  order to reinforce the training of the neural network.   The Monte Carlo process can be also used to help to improve the network  performance. By combining the individual networks obtained from the  Monte Carlo trials, we can often obtain a more accurate classification. The  same input is applied to all of the networks, and the outputs can be com- bined through a “voting” procedure. We choose the class that is selected by  the largest number of networks.  Data Sets  There are two data files associated with this case study:   ekg_p.txt — contains the input vectors in the ekg data set   ekg_t.txt — contains the targets in the ekg data set  They can be found with the demonstration software, which is described in  Appendix C.  25-10   Epilogue  Epilogue  This chapter has demonstrated the use of multilayer neural networks for  pattern recognition. In this case study, the pattern recognition network  was used to classify EKG records into healthy and myocardial infarction di- agnoses.  Most pattern recognition tasks involve a feature extraction step, in which  the original data set is reduced in dimension. The features that were ex- tracted from the EKG data consisted of characteristics of the prototype  EKG cycle.  25  A Monte Carlo procedure was used as part of the network validation. The  data were randomly divided a number of times into training validation test  sets, and for each division a neural network was trained with random ini- tial weights. The performances of all of the networks were analyzed to de- termine expected future performance. In addition, those records that were  misclassified by most of the networks, regardless of the data division, were  analyzed to assist in refining the data set and improving the pattern recog- nition.  In the next chapter, we apply neural networks to a clustering problem. We  will use a self-organizing feature map network for that application.  25-11   25 Case Study 3: Pattern Recognition  Further Reading  [Dubi00]  D.

In clustering problems, you want a neural network to group data by simi- larity. For example, market segmentation can be done by grouping people  according to their buying patterns, data mining can be done by partitioning  data into related subsets, and bioinformatic analysis can be done by group- ing genes with related expression patterns.  In this chapter, we will apply clustering to a problem in forestry, in which  we would like to analyze forest cover types. We will use the self-organizing  feature map network of Chapter 16 to perform the clustering, and we will  demonstrate a variety of visualization tools that can be used in conjunction  with the SOFM.  26-1   26 Case Study 4: Clustering  Theory and Examples  This chapter presents a case study in using neural networks for clustering.  In clustering problems, we generally don’t have a set of network targets  available, so clustering networks are trained by unsupervised training al- gorithms. Instead of training a network to produce a desired response, we  want to analyze a data set to look for hidden patterns. There are many ap- plication areas for clustering. It is widely used in data mining, in which we  analyze large data sets to identify similarities within subsets of the data.  It is used in city planning, when town councils apportion regions of the city  into areas of similar home type and land usage. It is used in image compres- sion, in which a small set of prototype sub-images are identified and com- bined to represent a large collection of images. It is used in speech  recognition systems, in which speakers are clustered into categories in or- der to simplify the problem of speaker-independent recognition. Clustering  is used by marketers to identify distinct groups in their customer bases. It  has also been used to organize large bibliographic data bases so that relat- ed material can be quickly accessed.  The neural network that we will use in this application is the self-organiz- ing feature map  SOFM , which we introduced in Chapter 16. This cluster- ing network has a unique attribute that enables us to visualize large data  sets in many dimensions. We will focus on that visualization capability in  this case study.  Description of the Forest Cover Problem  An important job of the forest service is to maintain accurate natural re- source inventory information. One key characteristic that is recorded is the  type of forest cover found in wilderness areas. This type of data can be ex- pensive to collect, since it generally requires on-site inspection or estima- tion from remotely sensed data. [BlDe99] describes how forest cover type  can be predicted from independent variables that can be more easily ob- tained. In this chapter, we will use the data described in that paper to per- form a clustering analysis. We will demonstrate how an analysis of the  data using an SOFM can allow us to visualize the high-dimensional space  of independent variables and identify relationships between the forest cov- er types.  Ten independent variables that can indicate forest cover type are shown in  Table 26.1.  There were 12 variables used in [BlDe99], but for ease of pre- sentation, we selected only the first 10 for this case study.  These variables  can be measured or estimated much more easily than forest cover type. We  want to use the SOFM to find out whether these variables can be used to  cluster the data in such a way as to separate regions with different forest  cover types.  26-2   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  Description of the Forest Cover Problem  Variable Number Description  Elevation in meters  Aspect in degrees azimuth  Slope in degrees  Horz Dist to nearest surface water  Vert Dist to nearest surface water  Horz Dist to nearest roadway  Units  meters  azimuth  degrees  meters  meters  meters  26  Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice  0 to 255 index  Hillshade index at noon, summer solstice  0 to 255 index  Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice  0 to 255 index  10  Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points meters  Table 26.1 Description of Independent Variables  The forest cover types of interest in [BlDe99] are shown in Table 26.1. The  data set we will use for this case study contains information on cover type,  but we will not use this as part of the training process. We will use it to test  the clustering ability of the SOM.

It contains the  forest cover type for 30 x 30 meter cells obtained from US Forest Service   USFS  Region 2 Resource Information System  RIS  data. The original  data set contained 581,012 observations of 12 independent variables and  the forest cover type. We have used the first 20,000 observations, and we  have used only the first 10 independent variables, which are described in  Table 26.1. The forest cover types are given in Table 26.2. As mentioned  previously, we did not use these for training.  For supervised learning, as demonstrated in the previous three chapters,  after the data is collected, the next step is to divide the data into training,  validation and test sets. For unsupervised learning, we don’t generally di- vide the data in this way, because there is no need for a validation set to  stop the training. Competitive training is typically performed for a fixed  number of iterations. We use the entire data set for training.  The next step is to normalize the data. The data were scaled using Eq.   22.1 , so that the inputs were in the range [-1,1].  For the SOFM, data can  also be scaled using Eq.  22.2 , so that the input variables have a mean of  0 and a variance of 1.   Before proceeding to train the network, it is often useful to view the input  data. One convenient format for this is the scatter plot. Figure 26.1 illus- trates a set of scatter plots among the input variables 7, 8 and 9. The diag- onal plots in this figure are histograms for these three input variables, and  the off-diagonal plots are the scatter plots.  We only show three of the vari- ables in this figure because of the limits of the page size.   8  9  1  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1 −1  8000  6000  4000  2000  0 −1  0 7 8  0  1  1  9  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1 −1  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1 −1  6000  4000  2000  0 −1  0 7  0 8 9  0  1  1  1  8000  6000  4000  2000  0 −1  7  0  26-4  Figure 26.1  Scatter Plots for Input Variables 7, 8, 9.   Selecting the Architecture  There are several things we can look for in Figure 26.1. First, we want to  see how well the data is scattered throughout the range. If some variables  show little or no variation, then we would remove them from the analysis.  We also look for correlation between the variables. For example, if the  points in the scatter plot fell exactly along a line, then we would know that  the two variables were linearly related. There would be no need to use both  variables in the analysis. From Figure 26.1 we can see that there is some  correlation between the variables, but they are not linearly dependent.  Selecting the Architecture  We will use the SOFM network, described in Chapter 16, to perform the  clustering for this case study. The specific architecture is often selected  based, in part, on the number of data points, so that there will be a reason- able amount of data associated with each prototype vector.  Recall that  each row of the weight matrix represents a prototype vector. An input is as- sociated with the prototype vector to which it is closest.  As the data set size  increases, the number of neurons should increase as well, although not as  rapidly. A rule of thumb is to have the number of neurons increase as the  square root of the number of data points.  Figure 26.2 shows the architecture of the network we selected. We have 10  input variables  defined in Table 26.1 , and we are using 150 neurons. The  feature map is 15x10, and it uses an hexagonal arrangement of neurons.  This means that each internal neuron will have six neighbors.

In practical cases, we often  try several different architectures. Unlike with supervised training, in  which we have a clear performance measure  normally sum square error ,  there is no firm criterion for best performance in SOFM networks. Often   26-5   Training the Network  26 Case Study 4: Clustering  what we are looking for is insight into the data set. It is somewhat of an art  to selecting the best architecture and training regime for SOFM networks.  This will become more clear when we analyze the results of the trained net- work in a later section.  Before beginning the training, the weight vectors  rows of W  were initial- ized using what is called linear initialization [Koho95]. First, a covariance  matrix of the input vectors was computed. Then, the two eigenvectors of  this matrix having the two largest eigenvalues were found. The rows of W  were then assigned by taking the average of the input vectors and adding  linear combinations of the two eigenvectors. This places all of the initial  weight vectors in the space spanned by the two eigenvectors. This initial- ization process produces quicker training convergence than when using a  purely random weight initialization.  It is also possible to randomly select  input vectors from the training set to be the initial weight vectors.  Recall from Eq.  16.21  the SOFM learning rule, which we repeat here:  wi  q   wi  1– q    p q  wi +  –    1– q      1 –   wi  1– q   p q  +  =  =  where   i   is the index of the winning neuron, and  i Ni d     26.1   Ni d    26.2  defines the neuron neighborhood. For this case study, we have used a batch  form of the algorithm, in which all of the inputs in the training set are ap- plied to the network before the weights are updated. To develop the batch  form, we can first modify the sequential form of Eq.  26.1  to   j dij  d  =    wi  q   =  wi  1– q    +  hi i p q  wi  –    1– q      ,   26.3   where  would produce Eq.  26.1  is  hi i   is the neighborhood function. The neighborhood function that   Using this definition of neighborhood function, we can define a batch ver- sion of Eq.  26.1 :   26.4    26.5   hi i  =    0      i Ni d   i Ni d    wi  k   =  Q   hi q  i p q  q -------------------------------------  1=  ,  Q    q  1=  hi q  i  26-6   Validation  i q   k   is the iteration number and   where   is the winning neuron for input  p q  . Note that for the batch algorithm we have to distinguish between the  iteration number and the input number, since all inputs are applied to the  network at each iteration. This is in contrast to the sequential algorithm of  Eq.  26.1 , where there is one iteration for each input. Also, notice that the  learning rate does not affect the batch algorithm, since it would appear in  both the numerator and the denominator of Eq.  26.5 .  For the neighborhood function of Eq.  26.4 , this batch algorithm has the  effect of assigning each weight to the average of the input vectors for which  it is in the neighborhood of the winner. As with the sequential algorithm,  the neighborhood size is decreased during training. The neighborhood size  is set large at the beginning of training until all weights move into the re- gion of the input space where the data lies. Then the neighborhood size is  reduced, to fine-tune the position of the weights.  The batch algorithm requires many fewer iterations than the sequential al- gorithm, although each iteration requires much more computation. For  this case study, we used two iterations of the batch algorithm. During the  first iteration the neighborhood size was 4, and during the second iteration  the neighborhood size was reduced to 1.  26  Validation  We will consider two numerical measures of the quality of a trained SOM:  resolution and topology preservation  see page 22-23 . One measure of  SOM resolution is the quantization error, which is the average distance be- tween each data vector and its winning neuron. If the average distance is  too large, then there are many input vectors that are not adequately repre- sented by any of the prototypes.  A measure of SOM topology preservation is the topographic error. This is  the proportion of all input vectors for which the closest  winning  neuron  and the next closest neuron are not adjacent to each other in the feature  map topology. When this number is small, it means that the neurons that  are neighbors in the topology are also neighbors in the input space. It is im- portant that this topology be preserved, so that the visualization tools we  will discuss later can provide valid insight into the data set.  For our trained SOM, the final quantization error was 0.535, and the final  topographic error was 0.037. This means that for less than 4% of all input  vectors, the winning neuron and the next closest neuron were not adjacent  to each other. It appears that the SOM has achieved the correct topology by  the completion of the training.  There are a number of visualization methods that can be used to assess the  trained SOM network. One of the key tools is called the unified distance  matrix, or u-matrix. This is a figure that shows the distance between neigh- boring neurons in the feature map. The u-matrix has a cell for each neuron   26-7   26 Case Study 4: Clustering  in the feature map and an additional cell between each pair of neurons. The  cells between neurons are color-coded with the distance between the corre- sponding weight vectors. The cells that represent the neurons are coded  with the mean of the surrounding values. Figure 26.3 shows the u-matrix  for our trained SOM.     0.6  0.5  0.4  0.3  0.2  0.1     Figure 26.3  U-Matrix for Trained SOM  In Figure 26.3, the light-colored cells represent large distances between  neurons. We can see that there is a string of light colored cells on the left  side of the feature map. This indicates that the clusters associated with the  neurons on the left side of the map are significantly different than those in  the middle and right sides of the map. For this data set we actually know  the forest cover types for each data point. We can label the feature map  cells with the cover type that is associated with the closest input vector to  that cluster center. The resulting labeled map is shown in Figure 26.4.  By comparing Figure 26.4 with Figure 26.3, we can see that the forest cover  type 2  see Table 26.2  is associated with the left edge of the feature map.  As we move from left to right across the map, we see type 0 and 1 coded into  the center section, followed by types 5, 3 and 4, with type 6 located mainly  in the upper right section of the map. It is clear that the SOM has learned  to cluster the data according to forest cover type.  To get more insight into how the SOM has clustered the data, we can pro- duce a “hit histogram.” For this graph, we count how many times each neu- ron was the winning neuron for the entire data set. Since our data is  labeled with forest cover type, we can also see where each type falls on the  feature map. Such a graph is displayed in Figure 26.5. In each cell you can  see a hexagram with a certain gray-scale. The size of the hexagrams indi- cate how many times the corresponding neuron was the winning neuron.  The gray level of the hexagram indicates the forest cover type. The darkest  hexagons correspond to type 0 forest covers, and the lightest hexagons cor- respond to type 6 forest covers. We can see that the various regions of the   26-8   Validation  map have consistent colors. The left side has medium gray levels, corre- sponding to type 2 cover. The darkest levels are in the center-left region of  the map, which corresponds to cover types 0 and 1. The lighter levels,  which correspond to types 5 and 6, are in the center-right region, and the  median levels of gray, corresponding to types 3 and 4, are on the right edge.  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  0  2  2  2  2  1  2  0  2  2  2  2  2  2  0  0  0  2  2  2  2  1  1  0  0  1  0  2  2  1  1  0  1  1  0  2  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  2  0  1  0  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  1  2  0  0  0  0  0  5  5  5  0  0  1  2  6  5  5  5  5  2  1  1  6  5  5  5  5  5  2  6  6  3  5  5  5  5  5  6  3  3  5  5  6  5  6  6  3  3  3  4  6  5  6  3  3  3  4  4  6  3  4  4  4  4  4  4  5  3  4  4  4  4  4  4  26  Figure 26.4  Labeled SOM  For many problems, we would not be able to label each input vector. The  point here is that the SOM has been able to cluster the data into similar  cover types, without knowing what the actual cover types were. This means  that the 10 variables making up the input vectors have enough correlation  with cover type to allow the SOM to make a useful clustering of the data.  Another tool that is useful in analyzing the trained SOM is the component  plane. A component plane is a figure that represents a column of the weight  matrix of the SOM. Each column corresponds to one element of the input  vector; the jth element of column i represents the connection from input i  to neuron j. In a component plane, each element of the weight is represent- ed by a cell in the feature map topology at the location of the neuron to  which it is connected. The gray level of the cell represents the magnitude  of that element of the weight vector.  The ten component planes  one for each column of the weight matrix - each  element of the input vector  for the trained SOM are shown in Figure 26.6.  The first thing that we notice is that each of the columns is distinct. There  are no two columns that have the same pattern. We can also see that input  variables 1, 4, 5, 6 and 10 seem to be important in separating type 2 cover  types from the rest of the data. They show patterns in which a boundary  appears on the left edge of the feature map, where the type 2 cover types  are clustered. By going back to Table 26.1, we can then locate the appropri- ate variables to see if we can deduce their connection to type 2 cover.  26-9   26 Case Study 4: Clustering  Figure 26.5  Hit Histogram for Trained SOM  3  7              −0.2  −0.4  −0.6  0.8 0.6 0.4        4  8        −0.4  −0.6  −0.8  0.8  0.4  1  5  9                    2  6  10           0  −0.4  −0.4 −0.45 −0.5  0.4  0  −0.4           0.5 0 −0.5  0.5  0  −0.5  0.5 0 −0.5  Figure 26.6  Component Planes for the Trained SOM  Data Sets  There are two data files associated with this case study:    cover_p.txt — contains the input vectors in the data set    cover_t.txt — contains the targets  labels  in the data set  They can be found with the demonstration software, which is described in  Appendix C.  26-10   Epilogue  Epilogue  This chapter has demonstrated the use of SOM networks for clustering, in  which input vectors in a data set are arranged so that similar vectors are  placed in the same cluster. In this case study, the SOM was used to cluster  forestry data. The idea was to cluster land into similar forest cover types.  One of the principal advantages of the SOM network, in addition to its abil- ity to efficiently cluster a data set, is its ability to enable visualization of  high dimensional data sets.  In the next chapter, we apply neural networks to a prediction problem. We  will use a Nonlinear Autoregressive model with eXogenous inputs  NARX   network for that application.  26  26-11   26 Case Study 4: Clustering  Further Reading  [BlDe99]  J. A. Blackard and D. J.

Prediction is a kind of dynamic filtering, in which past values of one or  more time series are used to predict future values. Dynamic networks, such  as those described in Chapter 10 and Chapter 14, are used for filtering and  prediction. Unlike the previous case studies, the input to these dynamic  networks is a time sequence.  There are many applications for prediction. For example, a financial ana- lyst might want to predict the future value of a stock, bond, or other finan- cial instrument. An engineer might want to predict the impending failure  of a jet engine. Predictive models are also used for system identification  or  dynamic modeling , in which we build dynamic models of physical systems.  These dynamic models are important for analysis, simulation, monitoring  and control of a variety of systems, including manufacturing systems,  chemical processes, robotics and aerospace systems. In this chapter we will  demonstrate the development of predictive models for a magnetic levita- tion system.  27-1   27 Case Study 5: Prediction  Theory and Examples  This chapter presents a case study in using neural networks for prediction.  In this case study, the predictor neural network is used to model a dynamic  system. This dynamic modeling from data is referred to as system identifi- cation. System identification can be applied to a variety of systems: eco- nomic, aerospace, biological, transportation, communication,  manufacturing, chemical process, etc. For this case study, we will consider  a simple magnetic levitation system. Magnetic levitation has been used for  many years in transportation systems. In our simple maglev system, we  will suspend a magnet above an electromagnet. A maglev train works on a  similar principle.  Description of the Magnetic Levitation System  The objective of this maglev system is to control the position of a magnet  suspended above an electromagnet, where the magnet is constrained so  that it can only move in the vertical direction, as shown in Figure 27.1.  N  S  y t     i t     +  -  Figure 27.1  Magnetic Levitation System  The equation of motion for this system is  d2y t  --------------- dt2  =  g–  +   ----- M  i2 t   i t  ---------------------------------   sgn y t   –   ----- M  dy t  ------------  dt   27.1   y t    is the gravitational constant. The parameter    is the distance of the magnet above the electromagnet,    is  where   is the mass of the magnet, and  the current flowing in the electromagnet,   is a viscous friction coef- g ficient that is determined by the material in which the magnet moves, and   is a field strength constant that is determined by the number of turns of   wire on the electromagnet and the strength of the magnet. For our case  study, the parameter values are set to  M 3=  12=  15=  i t   9.8  M    ,   ,   ,       =  g  .  27-2   Data Collection and Preprocessing  The objective of the case study will be to develop a dynamic neural network  model that can predict the next value of the magnet position, based on pre- vious values of the magnet position and the input current. Once the model  has been developed, it can be used to find a controller that can determine  the correct current to apply to the electromagnet, so as to move the magnet  to some desired position. We won’t go in to the control design in this case  study, but the reader is referred to [HaDe02] and [NaMu97].  Data Collection and Preprocessing  For this case study, we did not build the maglev system of Figure 27.1. In- stead, we created a computer simulation to implement Eq.  27.1 . We used  Simulink® to implement the simulation, but any simulation tool could be  used. For our simulations, the current was allowed to range from -1 to 4  amps. The data were collected every 0.01 seconds.  To develop an accurate model, we need to be sure that the system inputs  and outputs cover the operating range for which the system will be used.  For system identification problems, we often collect training data while ap- plying random inputs which consist of a series of pulses of random ampli- tude and duration.  This form of input is sometimes called a skyline  function, because of its resemblance to a city skyline.  The duration and  amplitude of the pulses must be chosen carefully to produce accurate iden- tification. Figure 27.2 shows the input current, and the corresponding mag- net position for our data set. A total of 4000 data points were collected.  27     A      t n e r r u C     m      n o i t i s o P  4  2  0  8  6  4  2  0 0  27-3  0  10  20  30  40  10  20  Time  Sec   30  40  Figure 27.2  Magnetic Levitation Data  The skyline form of input function has the advantage that it can explore  both transient and steady state operation of the system. Because some of  the pulses are long, the system will approach steady state at the end of    27 Case Study 5: Prediction  those pulses. Shorter width pulses explore transient operation of the sys- tem.  When steady state performance is poor, it is useful to increase the duration  of the input pulses. Unfortunately, within a training data set, if we have  too much data in steady state conditions, the training data may not be rep- resentative of typical plant behavior. This is due to the fact that the input  and output signals do not adequately cover the region that is going to be  controlled. This will result in poor transient performance. We need to  choose the training data so that we produce adequate transient and steady  state performance. This can be done by using an input sequence with a  range of pulse widths and amplitudes.  After the data has been collected, the next step is to divide the data into  training, validation and test sets. In this case, because we will be using the  Bayesian regularization training technique, we do not need to have a vali- dation set. We did set aside 15% of the data for testing purposes. When the  input is a time sequence, it is useful to have the testing sequence consist of  a contiguous segment of the original data set. For our tests, we used the  last 15% of the data as the testing set.  The data were scaled using Eq.  22.1 , so that both the inputs and the tar- gets were in the range [-1,1]. The resulting scaled data is shown in Figure  27.3  10  20  30  40  10  20  Time  Sec   30  40  Figure 27.3  Scaled Data  t n e r r u C  n o i t i s o P  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1 0  0.5  1  0  −0.5  −1 0  27-4  Selecting the Architecture  There are many dynamic network architectures that can be used for pre- diction. A popular architecture is the nonlinear autoregressive network    Selecting the Architecture  with exogenous inputs  NARX  network, which was discussed in Chapter  22. The NARX network is a recurrent dynamic network, with feedback con- nections enclosing several static layers of the network. The NARX model is  based on the linear ARX model, which is commonly used in time series  modeling.  The defining equation for the NARX model is  y t   =   f y t  1–   y t   2–    y t     ny–   u t   1–   u t   2–    u t     nu–      ,  27.2   y t   u t   u t   .  For our application,   where the next value of the dependent output signal   is regressed on  previous values of the output signal and previous values of an independent   exogenous  input signal   is the position of  the magnet, and   is the current going into the electromagnet.  We can  implement the NARX model by using a feedforward neural network to ap- proximate the function  . A diagram of the resulting network is shown  in the Figure 27.4, where a two-layer feedforward network is used for the  approximation. The output of the last layer of the network is the prediction  of the next value of the magnet position. The network input is the current  into the electromagnet.  f   y t   We are using the tan-sigmoid transfer function in the hidden layer, and a  linear output layer. As with the standard multilayer network, the number  of neurons in the hidden layer,  , will depend on the complexity of the sys- tem being approximated. We will discuss this choice in the next section.

Later, we will investigate other possibilities.  =  =  2  ny  nu  Before demonstrating the training of the NARX network, we need to  present an important configuration that is useful in training. We can con- sider the output of the NARX network to be an estimate of the output of the  nonlinear dynamic system that we are trying to model. The output is fed  back to the input of the feedforward neural network, as part of the stan- dard NARX architecture, as shown on the left side of Figure 27.5. Since the  true output is available during the training of the network, we could create  a series-parallel architecture  see [NaPa90] , in which the true output is  used instead of feeding back the estimated output, as shown on the right  side of Figure 27.5. This has two advantages. The first is that the input to  the feedforward network will be more accurate. The second is that the re- sulting network has a purely feedforward architecture, and static back- propagation can be used for training.  u   t  T D L  T D L  Feed  Forward Network     y t^  u   t     y t  T D L  T D L  Feed  Forward Network     y t^  Parallel Architecture  Series-Parallel Architecture  Figure 27.5  Parallel and Series-Parallel Forms  Using the series-parallel form, we can actually use a standard multilayer  network to implement the NARX model.

The prediction problem  is similar to the function approximation problem, which was demonstrated  in Chapter 23, and the Bayesian regularization method is effective for both  applications.  Because we have 4000 data points, and the number of network weights and  biases will be less than 100  as we will see later , the chances of overfitting  are very small. We do not need to use Bayesian regularization  or early  stopping  in this case. However, because it can tell us the effective number  of parameters, we like to use it whenever it is appropriate.  Figure 27.6 illustrates the sum square error versus iteration number,  while using Bayesian regularization. We used a network with 10 neurons  in the hidden layer     for this case. The network was trained for  1000 iterations, at which time the performance was changing very little.  Several different networks were trained with different initial conditions,  and the final SSE was similar for each, so we can be confident that we did  not reach a local minimum.  10=  S1  27  E S S  105  104  103  102  101  100  10−1  10−2  10−3  10−4  100  27-7  101  Iterations  102  103  Figure 27.6  Sum Squared Error vs. Iteration Number    S1  10=       In Figure 27.7, we can see the variation of the effective number of param- eters   during training. It eventually converges to 39. There are a total of  61 parameters in this 4-10-1 network, so we are effectively using less than  2 3 of the weights and biases. If the effective number of parameters was  close to the total number of parameters, then we would increase the num- ber of hidden neurons and retrain the network. That is not the case here.   27 Case Study 5: Prediction  There is no need to decrease the number of neurons, since the network com- putation time is not critical for this application. The only other reason for  reducing the number of neurons would be to prevent overfitting. In terms  of preventing overfitting, having 39 effective parameters is equivalent to  having 39 total parameters. That is the beauty of using the Bayesian reg- ularization technique. This method chooses the correct number of parame- ters for each problem, as long as we have a sufficient number of potential  parameters in the network.  40  30  20  10    0 0  200  400 Iterations  600  800  1000  Figure 27.7  Effective Number of Parameters    S1  10=     Validation  As we discussed in previous chapters, an important tool for network vali- dation is a scatter plot of network outputs versus targets, as shown in Fig- ure 27.8  in normalized units . The figure on the left shows the training  data, while the figure on the right shows the testing data. Because the test- ing data fit is as good as the training data fit, we can be confident that the  network did not overfit.  For prediction problems, there is another set of tools for model validation.  These tools are based on two basic properties of accurate prediction models.  The first property is that the prediction errors,  e t   =  y t   –  yˆ t   =  y t   –  a2 t   ,   27.5   should be uncorrelated with each other from one time step to the next. The  second property is that prediction errors should be uncorrelated with the  input sequence   .  See [BoJe86].   u t   27-8   Validation  If the prediction errors were correlated with each other, then we could use  that correlation to improve the predictions. For example, if prediction er- rors one time step apart had a positive correlation, then a large positive  prediction error at the current time point would suggest that the prediction  error at the next time point would also be positive. By lowering our next  prediction, we could then reduce the next prediction error.

For accurate prediction models, there should be no cor- relation between the input and the prediction error. If there was correla- tion, then we could use this correlation to improve the predictor.  To measure the correlation in a time sequence, we use the autocorrelation  function, which can be estimated by  Re    =  e t e t  +    .   27.6   1  ------------ Q –  Q –    t  1=  The autocorrelation function of the prediction error  in normalized units   of our trained network for the maglev problem is shown in Figure 27.9.  For the prediction error to be uncorrelated  termed “white” noise , the au- tocorrelation function should be an impulse at  , with all other values  equal to zero. Because Eq.  27.6  provides only an estimate of the true au- tocorrelation function, the values at   will never be exactly equal to ze- ro. If the error sequence is white noise, then we can find confidence  intervals for the     see [BoJe86]  defined by  0=  0      Re    27-9  27   27 Case Study 5: Prediction    2  Re 0  ------------- Q  .   27.7   Re    x 10−8  6  4  2  0  −50  0   50  Figure 27.9    Re   ny      =  nu  =  ,   S1  2  10=     The dashed blue lines in Figure 27.9 indicate these confidence bounds.

However, because of the series-parallel  configuration, these are errors for only a one-step-ahead prediction. A more  stringent test would be to rearrange the network into the original parallel  form and then to perform an iterated prediction over many time steps. We  will now demonstrate the parallel operation.  Figure 27.14 illustrates the iterated prediction. The solid line is the actual  position of the magnet, and the dashed line is the position predicted by the  NARX neural network. The network prediction is very accurate - even 600  time steps ahead.

In this case study, the  prediction network was used as a model of a magnetic levitation system.  This modeling of dynamic systems is referred to as system identification.  A Nonlinear Autoregressive model with eXogenous inputs  NARX  network  is well suited to this problem, and Bayesian regularization is an excellent  training algorithm to use in this situation.  27-14   Further Reading  Further Reading  [BoJe94]  [HaDe02]  [NaMu97]  [NaPa90]  G.

De Jesus, “An Introduction to the  Use of Neural Networks in Control Systems,” International  Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, vol. 12, no. 11,  pp. 959-985, 2002.  This survey paper describes some practical aspects of using  neural networks for control systems. Three neural network  controllers are demonstrated: model predictive control,  NARMA-L2 control, and model reference control.  Narendra, K.S.; Mukhopadhyay, S., “Adaptive control us- ing neural networks and approximate models,” IEEE  Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 8, no. 3, pp. 475 -  485, 1997.  This paper introduced the NARMA-L2 model and control- ler. Once the NARMA-L2 model is trained, it can be easily  inverted to form a controller for the identified system.  K. S. Narendra and K.

However, MATLAB is not essential for using  this book. The computer exercises can performed with any available pro- gramming language, and the Neural Network Design Demonstrations,  while helpful, are not critical to understanding the material covered in this  book.  MATLAB is widely available and, because of its matrix vector notation and  graphics, is a convenient environment in which to experiment with neural  networks. We use MATLAB in two different ways. First, we have included  a number of exercises for the reader to perform in MATLAB. Many of the  important features of neural networks become apparent only for large scale  problems, which are computationally intensive and not feasible for hand  calculations. With MATLAB, neural network algorithms can be quickly im- plemented, and large scale problems can be tested conveniently. If MAT- LAB is not available, any other programming language can be used to  perform the exercises.  The second way in which we use MATLAB is through the Neural Network  Design Demonstrations, which can be downloaded from the website      hagan.okstate.edu nnd.html. These interactive demonstrations illustrate  important concepts in each chapter. The icon to the left identifies referenc- es to these demonstrations in the text.  MATLAB, or the student edition of MATLAB, version 2010a or later,  should be installed on your computer in a a folder named MATLAB. To cre- ate this directory or folder and complete the MATLAB installation process,  follow the instructions given in the MATLAB documentation. Take care to  follow the guidelines given for setting the path.   After the Neural Network Design Demonstration software has been loaded  into the MATLAB directory on your computer  or if the MATLAB path has  been set to include the directory containing thedemonstration software ,  the demonstrations can be invoked by typing nnd at the MATLAB prompt.  All demonstrations are easily accessible from a master menu.   C-1  C   C   Software  Overview of Demonstration Files  Running the Demonstrations You can run the demonstrations directly by typing their names at the  MATLAB prompt. Typing help nndesign brings up a list of all the demos you  can choose from.   Alternatively, you can run the Neural Network Design splash window  nnd   and then click the Contents button. This will take you to a graphical Table  of Contents. From there you can select chapters with buttons at the bottom  of the window and individual demonstrations with popup menus.   Sound Many of the demonstrations use sound. In many cases the sound adds to  the understanding of a demonstration. In other cases it is there simply for  fun. If you need to turn the sound off you can give MATLAB the following  command and all demonstrations will run quietly:   To turn sound back on:    nnsound off    nnsound on   List of Demonstrations  General  You may note that demonstrations that utilize sound often run faster when  sound is off. In addition, on some machines which do not support sound er- rors can occur unless the sound is turned off.  nnd - Splash screen. nndtoc - Table of contents. nnsound - Turn Neural Network Design sounds on and off.
